Fast ﬂuxing. Also surprisingly, we discovered that RESIPs
serve as Fast ﬂux proxies for malicious websites to evade IP
based detection. In a fast ﬂux, numerous IP addresses associated
with a malicious domain are swapped in and out with high
frequency. Applying Passive DNS data and VirusTotal APIs to
the sampled 600K RESIPs, we discovered that 1.14% of the
proxy IPs were once mapped to malicious domains during the
periods when they were RESIPs, and on average, the mapping
from these malicious domains to the proxy IPs lasted 86.8
days. However, the median was only 2 days. Table VI lists
the top 5 domains resolved to most proxy IPs. Except for
opengw.net which allows volunteers to serve as VPNs for
others, all other four are dynamic DNS providers. Some of
them are previously reported being abused by the miscreant to
conduct various illicit activities [8], which are also conﬁrmed
by us, as many subdomains of them are labeled by VirusTotal
as malicious such as yohoy.no-ip.biz, darkjabir.no-ip.info, and
595685744.duckdns.org.
D. RESIP vs. Bots
Another interesting question is how RESIPs relate to bots,
especially, whether RESIPs are bots, and whether methodolo-
gies for detecting bots work for RESIPs. Regarding whether
RESIPs are bots, we identiﬁed connections between them. In
particular, 1,248 IPs were blacklisted as bots of Hajime or
IoT Reaper on the same day when they offered proxy services
(see Appendix IX-B); in addition, we also identiﬁed devices
that were likely recruited through stealthy compromise, as
detailed in §IV-B. Both indicate the existence of bots acting as
RESIPs. Nevertheless, we also identiﬁed channels for volunteer
recruitment, suggesting willingly joined users are also part of
the RESIP networks.
Meanwhile, compared to bots, RESIPs are observed to
exhibit different characteristics that indicate new challenges
for detection. Unlike a bot, a RESIP is a proxy to help users
access web services in a seemingly legitimate way. Although
RESIP services recruit hosts in a highly suspicious manner,
they likely also include legitimate volunteer participants. A
prominent example is Luminati, which has a recruitment system.
Furthermore, identiﬁed RESIP programs, including the PUPs,
all have limited privileges, while bots usually acquire the
highest privilege [74]. Also, unlike the botnet exclusively
serving cybercrimes, RESIP services are promoted publicly
and are likely also utilized by legitimate users. In addition,
botnets are found to ﬂux the addresses (IPs and domains) of
their C&C servers or run them on bulletproof hosting to evade
detection and blocking [76][54]. In contrast, RESIP services
only involve a limited number of server IPs and domains, and
most of them belong to popular hosting providers (See §V-B).

Therefore, intuitively the collective behaviors of a RESIP
service can be very different from these of a botnet, which was
conﬁrmed by our study based on the RESIP trafﬁc logs (§III-D)
and a representative botnet trafﬁc dataset (CTU-13 [65]) with
the network ﬂows of both normal hosts and 7 different types of
bots. In the study, we looked at the network ﬂow features
commonly used for botnet detection [57] [84] [82] [67] .
Examples include unique ﬂows per machine hour, unique
destination IPs per machine hour, and unique destinations
(IP/Port pairs) per machine hour. Figure 6 illustrates the
CDFs of the unique destinations visited every machine hour
by bots, normal hosts and RESIPs: compared to the bot
trafﬁc, the RESIP trafﬁc looks more similar to the normal
one, as also observed when comparing other features across
the RESIP and botnet datasets (Table VII). This indicates
that the mixture of legitimate and illicit trafﬁc of the RESIP
service moves its statistical features closer to these of the
legitimate communication. Despite the above ﬁndings, we must
acknowledge the limitations of our approaches. For example, we
are not able to exhaustively consider all bot and RESIP types;
the trafﬁc data containing only the network ﬂow information
does not allow us to experiment detection methodologies such
as those based on deep packet inspection (DPI). Therefore, we
leave more detailed comparison analysis between RESIPs and
bots as our future work.
V. THE RESIP ECOSYSTEM
A. Landscape of RESIP Service
Through inﬁltrating RESIP services, we were able to collect
a pool of RESIP IP addresses. Speciﬁcally, everyday during
the inﬁltration period, we launched multiple RESIP crawling
jobs running across different hours in the whole day from
different locations and accounts, trying to reveal the landscape
of the RESIP pool. Overall, we captured 6 million RESIP IPs by
sending 62 million requests. Note that due to the IP churn issue
especially in mobile networks, the number of RESIP IPs here
should only be considered as an upper bound of the number
of RESIP hosts. Table VIII shows the RESIPs distribution in
different network blocks and ASes for each RESIP service
provider. We can observe that Luminati has the largest RESIP
pool, followed by Proxies Online and ProxyRack.
Table IX lists the top 3 countries, ASNs and ISPs with
most RESIPs. They all exhibit long-tailed distributions where

Luminati
TABLE IX: Top 3 countries, ASNs and ISPs with most RESIPs
a small fraction of countries, ASNs and ISPs contribute the
majority of RESIPs, respectively. For example, we ﬁnd that
even though Luminati is located in the United States, most
of its RESIPs are from Turkey, possibly because of Turkey’s
network censorship which makes Hola clients a good option to
visit blocked websites there. An interesting ﬁnding here is that
despite Luminati’s claim of having 30 million IPs, we only
found 4 millions using 16-million probings. It is unclear where
this gap comes from.
We also measured how many RESIPs a time zone contributes
during its different local hours. As shown in Figure 7, the
peak hours across time zones indeed exhibit diurnal patterns,
conﬁrming our previous ﬁndings that the majority devices of
RESIPs are indeed residential hosts that are more likely to be
powered off or disconnected during the night.
Figure 8(a) shows the evolution of the RESIP pools by
plotting the cumulative number of unique RESIP IPs. We
observe that a large number of RESIP IPs newly appear every
day with an average increase rate of 44%. However, when
considering the increase of fresh /16 IP preﬁxes, we observe
a much smaller rise (11%) in Figure 8(b). This is reasonable
because a given RESIP host is less likely to migrate from one
/16 IP preﬁx to another than to change from one IP to another.
B. Infrastructure and Service
Backend (hidden) gateways. Under the known infrastructure
of the RESIP service as illustrated in Figure 1, we found that
there are a series of hidden backend servers intermediating
between the frontend gateways and RESIPs, as shown in
Figure 8(d). Since those servers can be regarded as gateways
from the perspective of RESIPs, we call them backend (hidden)
gateways. These gateways were discovered from the connec-
tions between the proxy gateway and the RESIP, as documented
by our trafﬁc logs, PUP trafﬁc, and Passive DNS datasets.
Speciﬁcally, using Proxies Online as an example, we observed
that before relaying our inﬁltration trafﬁc, the PUP-hosted
RESIPs always communicate with lb-api.lambda.servers.jetstar.

gw.proxies.online, which is the frontend gateway. We then
investigated the PassiveDNS and found that the subdomains of
jetstar.media, pprx.work, junk.uno, and proxies.online share a
set of IPs as shown in Figure 8(d). This strongly indicates that
jetstar.media, pprx.work, and junk.uno also belong to Proxies
Online, and some of its subdomains act as backend gateways
to communicate with the RESIPs. Table X lists the hidden
backend gateways obtained from PUP trafﬁc for all providers.
Interestingly, we found that some hidden backend gateways
(pprx.com) were labeled by VirusTotal as malicious sites (at
least three indicators) while all of the frontend gateways were
clean. This indicates that decoupling different components
actually makes the ecosystem more robust.
