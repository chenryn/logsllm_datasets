User: I'm fighting with installation SIP for Python on Mac OS X. Finally after compilation and installation when I run console form folder of SIP (locally) I can import sipconfig, but when I`m in other folder I cant - there is no module called sipconfig.
My question is - Where is folder to which I have to copy modules if I want to have them available globally (like "import os"), or how I can check it, because location "/Library/Python/2.6/site-packages/" doesn`t work.
Assistant: You can designate an additional locations when python starts up by setting the environmental variable PYTHONPATH.
If you add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zscrc (depending on your default shell) something like:
PYTHONPATH=/Library/MyPyhonPackages:/Another/Location;
export PYTHONPATH
Then those locations will be added to "sys.path" whenever python starts up.
This will give you additional places to store your own packages or modules.
