I have been attempting to nest a `tf.while_loop` inside another `tf.while_loop` in my TensorFlow code. Despite multiple checks, I am encountering an error. If I manage to resolve this issue, I then face another error stating "nothing to read from index 0 of the tensor array, as nothing has been written to it."

If it would be helpful, I can share the full code. This code is based on modifications made to the original code by @alrojo, which was part of a fantastic tutorial.

Here are the screenshots of the errors for reference:

Please let me know if you need any additional information or the complete code for further analysis.
