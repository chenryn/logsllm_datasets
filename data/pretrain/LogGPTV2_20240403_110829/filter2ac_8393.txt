**ATT&CK ID:** T1218.011  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Rundll32

Adversaries may abuse the `rundll32.exe` utility to proxy the execution of malicious code. By using `rundll32.exe` instead of executing the code directly, attackers can potentially evade detection by security tools that might not monitor the `rundll32.exe` process due to allowlists or false positives from legitimate operations. 

`Rundll32.exe` is typically used to execute functions within DLLs. The command format for this is generally: `rundll32.exe {DLLname}, {DLLfunction}`. This technique allows adversaries to load and execute a specific function from a DLL, which can be a malicious payload.
