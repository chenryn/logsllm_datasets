### Understanding and Analyzing LOC in z/OS Dumps

**LOC Calculation:**
- **LOC** is calculated using the formula: `LOC = loadmod.csect + csect_offset`
  - **loadmod** refers to the name of the load module that was in control at the time of the abend. For example, CSQLLPLM. If the load module is unknown, it might be represented by an asterisk.
  - **csect** is the name of the Control Section (CSECT) in control at the time of the abend. For example, CSQL1GET.
  - **csect_offset** is the offset within the failing CSECT at the time of the abend. For example, 0246.

**Note:** The value of `csect_offset` may vary if service has been applied to this CSECT. Therefore, it should not be used when building a keyword string for searching the IBM software support database.

### Dump Title Variation with PSW and ASID

Some dump titles replace the load module name, CSECT name, and CSECT offset with the Program Status Word (PSW) and Address Space Identifier (ASID). This format is illustrated in Figure 52.

**Dump Title Format:**
- `ssnm,ABN=compltn-reason,U=userid,C=compid.release.comp-function,M=module,PSW=psw_contents,ASID=address_space_id`

**Figure 52. Dump Title with PSW and ASID**

- **psw_contents**: The PSW at the time of the error. For example, X'077C100000729F9C'.
- **address_space_id**: The address space in control at the time of the abend. For example, X'0011'. This field is not present for a channel initiator.

### SYSUDUMP Information on z/OS

The z/OS system can create SYSUDUMPs, which are useful for problem determination. A sample SYSUDUMP output and tools for interpreting SYSUDUMPs are provided. For more information, refer to the z/OS MVS Diagnosis: Tools and Service Aids manual.

### Snap Dumps on z/OS

Snap dump data sets are controlled by z/OS JCL command statements. This topic explains the CSQSNAP DD statement and how snap dumps are issued by adapters or the channel initiator.

- **Batch, CICS, IMS, or RRS Adapter**: Issued when an unexpected error is returned by the queue manager for an MQI call. A full dump is produced containing information about the program causing the problem.
- **Channel Initiator**: Issued in specific error conditions instead of a system dump. The dump contains information relating to the error, and message CSQX053E is also issued.

### SYS1.LOGREC Information on z/OS

The SYS1.LOGREC data set records various errors encountered by different components of the operating system. IBM MQ for z/OS recovery routines write information to the SYS1.LOGREC data set during retries or percolation to the next recovery routine.

- **Finding the Applicable SYS1.LOGREC Information**:
  - Use the EREP service aid to format records in the SYS1.LOGREC data set.
  - Specify the VERBEXIT LOGDATA keyword in IPCS.
  - Use option 7 on the DUMP ANALYSIS MENU.

### Suppressing SVC Dumps on z/OS

Under certain circumstances, SVC dumps are not produced. This topic explains why SVC dumps might be suppressed and how to suppress them using z/OS DAE.

- **Reasons for Suppression**:
  - z/OS serviceability level indication processing (SLIP) commands suppressed the abend.
  - The abend reason code did not require a dump.
  - SDWACOMU or SDWAEAS was used to suppress the dump.

### Dealing with Performance Problems on z/OS

Performance problems can be characterized by poor response times, long batch job completion times, and slow message transmission. These issues can be caused by a lack of resources or poor application design.

- **z/OS System Considerations**:
  - Use standard monitoring tools like RMF to diagnose and resolve storage, processor, DASD, and channel path usage constraints.
- **CICS Constraints**:
  - Performance can be affected by CICS constraints such as MAXTASK, storage shortages, and resource problems.
- **Dealing with Applications Running Slowly or Stopped**:
  - Investigate waits and loops, and use the z/OS console to issue operator commands for diagnostics.

### Distinguishing Between Waits and Loops on z/OS

Waits and loops can exhibit similar symptoms. This topic provides guidance on distinguishing between them and suggests actions based on the classification.

- **Waits**:
  - Task execution is suspended without completing.
  - Possible causes include MQI calls, CICS or IMS calls, file I/O, ECB waits, and resource constraints.
- **Loops**:
  - Repeated execution of some code.
  - Possible causes include excessive processing, application logic, MQI calls, CICS or IMS calls, and system loops.

### Symptoms of Waits and Loops

- **Timeouts on MQGET WAITs**
- **Batch jobs suspended**
- **TSO session suspended**
- **CICS task suspended**
- **Transactions not being started due to resource constraints**
- **Queues becoming full and not being processed**
- **System commands not accepted or producing no response**

### Related Concepts and Tasks

- **Dealing with Waits on z/OS**:
  - Investigate waits in batch, TSO applications, CICS transactions, and other components.
- **Dealing with Loops on z/OS**:
  - Determine where loops are occurring in different areas of the z/OS system.
