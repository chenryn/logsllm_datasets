User: In the field of big data, what is Hadoop? What are its main components? Please briefly introduce their functions and characteristics.
Assistant: Hadoop is an open source big data processing framework developed and maintained by the Apache Foundation. It can handle massive amounts of data and has the characteristics of high reliability and high scalability. The main components include: 1. Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS): Distributed file system for storing massive data. It stores data dispersedly on the hard disks of multiple machines, and provides high reliability and fault tolerance. 2. MapReduce: distributed computing framework. MapReduce distributes data processing, decomposes a calculation task into multiple small tasks to be calculated on different nodes, and finally summarizes the results. 3. Yet Another Resource Negotiator (YARN): resource manager, introduced in Hadoop2.0 version. It allows different types of applications to share Hadoop cluster resources and improve cluster utilization. 4. Hadoop Common: Common component library, including the core library and tool classes of the Hadoop framework. 5. Hadoop Oozie: Workflow engine for orchestrating various types of tasks and workflows. 6. Hadoop Hive: Data warehouse for storing structured data on Hadoop and providing a SQL-like query language. 7. Hadoop Pig: Data flow language, similar to Hive, but it can handle more complex unstructured data. The above components together constitute the Hadoop framework. They each have different functions and characteristics, but they can all play a role in the processing of massive data, and store, analyze, and process data. The Hadoop framework is free and open source, and has become a commonly used processing framework in the field of big data.
