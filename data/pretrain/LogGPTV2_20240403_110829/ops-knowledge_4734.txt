User: How to implement load balancing of web applications? Please list several common load balancing algorithms.
Assistant: The following methods can be used to achieve load balancing of web applications: 1. Hardware load balancer: load balancing is performed through special hardware devices, and application servers can be offloaded to reduce their burden. Common hardware load balancers include F5 and Cisco ACE wait. 2. Software load balancer: load balancing is performed through software, and can also be used in a virtualized environment, such as Nginx, HAProxy, LVS, etc. Common load balancing algorithms are: 1. Round Robin algorithm: assign requests to different servers in turn. 2. Weighted Round Robin Algorithm: Allocate according to the performance and load of different servers, and allocate more requests to servers with higher performance. 3. IP Hash Algorithm (IP Hash): Calculate the hash algorithm according to the requested IP address, and then distribute it to the corresponding server. 4. Least Connection algorithm: allocate requests to the server with the least number of connections to achieve load balancing. 5. Least Response Time algorithm: allocate requests according to the response time of the server, and allocate the request to the server with the shortest response time.
