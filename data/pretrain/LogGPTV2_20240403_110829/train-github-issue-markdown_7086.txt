I am working on a relatively small TypeScript (TS) web application project, consisting of approximately 10 source files. After creating a new file and adding some code, I encountered the following error:

```
Unable to send result to client.
Unable to get completion info from TypeScript: Error: Debug Failure. False expression.

My `.vscode/settings.json` file only contains the setting `"deno.enable": true`. My Deno extension version is v3.13.1.

Please let me know if there is any additional information you need.
