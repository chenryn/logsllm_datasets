**DoH Performs Worse Than Conventional DNS and DoT as Latencies Increase**

Figure 3 illustrates that DoH (DNS over HTTPS) performs significantly worse when the latency between the client and the recursive resolver is high. Figure 4 corroborates this finding using a ridge regression model. As discussed in Section 3.2, this performance degradation can be attributed to either the overhead of HTTPS, the immaturity of DoH implementations and deployments, or a combination of both.

**Subscribed Throughput Affects DNS Performance**

Figure 5 presents DNS response times for various open resolvers and the default resolver, grouped by downstream throughput using kernel density estimation. The performance of all protocols generally improves with increased throughput, with DoH showing the most significant relative improvement. For instance, for users with a throughput less than 25 Mbps, the median query response times for Resolver Y's DoH and conventional DNS are 73.4 ms and 48.7 ms, respectively. As throughput increases from 25 Mbps to 400 Mbps, the median query response times for Y DoH and Y DNS decrease to 41.2 ms and 31.4 ms, respectively. DoT (DNS over TLS) performs similarly to conventional DNS, regardless of downstream throughput. Across all groups, the absolute performance difference between Resolver X's DoT and conventional DNS is minimal, ranging from 0.2 ms to 1.9 ms. For Resolver Y, DoT outperforms conventional DNS in median query response times when throughput is less than 800 Mbps, with differences of 1.4 ms, 2.5 ms, and 1.7 ms for the three lower throughput groups, respectively.

**Does Encrypted DNS Resolver Performance Vary Across ISPs?**

Figure 6 examines how encrypted DNS response times vary across different resolvers and ISPs. The choice of resolver is crucial, and the optimal encrypted DNS resolver may depend on the user's ISP. For example, while ISP C performs comparably to other ISPs for queries sent to Resolver X, it has significantly lower query response times for Resolver Y and is one of the poorest performing ISPs for Resolver Z. The difference in median query response times between Resolver X's DoH and conventional DNS was 20.9 ms for Whiteboxes on ISP D and 8.9 ms for Whiteboxes on ISP E. For Z DoH, the difference in median times was 34.5 ms for Whiteboxes on ISP D and 47.9 ms for Whiteboxes on ISP E.

Resolver performance also varies across ISPs. For ISP B, the median query response time for Z DoT is 11.1 ms faster than Z DNS. However, for ISP C, Z DoT is significantly slower than conventional DNS, with a difference in median query response times of 30.6 ms. This performance discrepancy is attributed to higher latency to Resolver Z via ISP C. The median latency to Z DNS and DoT across Whiteboxes on ISP C was 50 ms, compared to 18.5 ms on ISP B.

### 4. Related Work

Researchers have compared the performance of DNS, DoT, and DoH in various ways. Zhu et al. introduced DoT to encrypt DNS traffic between clients and recursive resolvers, finding that DoT's overhead can be largely mitigated with connection re-use [25]. Böttger et al. measured the effect of DoT and DoH on query response times and page load times from a university network, concluding that DNS generally outperforms DoT in response times, and DoT outperforms DoH [3]. Hounsel et al. also measured response times and page load times for DNS, DoT, and DoH using Amazon EC2 instances, finding that despite higher response times, page load times for DoT and DoH can be faster than DNS on lossy networks [9]. Lu et al. used residential TCP SOCKS networks to measure response times from 166 countries, finding that, in the median case with connection re-use, DoT and DoH were slower than conventional DNS over TCP by 9 ms and 6 ms, respectively [14].

Researchers have also studied how DNS influences application performance. Sundaresan et al. used an early MBA deployment of 4,200 home gateways to identify performance bottlenecks for residential broadband networks, finding that page load times for users in home networks are significantly influenced by slow DNS response times [22]. Wang et al. introduced WProf, a profiling system that analyzes various factors contributing to page load times, finding that queries for uncached domain names at recursive resolvers can account for up to 13% of the critical path delay for page loads [23]. Otto et al. found that CDN performance is significantly affected by clients choosing recursive resolvers far from CDN caches, leading them to propose namehelp, a DNS proxy that sends queries for CDN-hosted content directly to authoritative servers [18]. Allman studied conventional DNS performance from 100 residences in a neighborhood, finding that only 3.6% of connections were blocked on DNS with lookup times greater than either 20 ms or 1% of the application's total transaction time [1].

Past work has also examined the performance impact of "last mile" connections to home networks. Kreibich et al. proposed Netalyzr, a Java applet that users run from devices in their home networks to test and debug Internet connectivity, measuring latency, IPv6 support, DNS manipulation, and more [12]. Dischinger et al. measured bandwidth, latency, and packet loss from 1,894 hosts and 11 major commercial cable and DSL providers in North America and Europe, finding that the "last mile" connection between an ISP and a home network is often a performance bottleneck [11].

### 5. Conclusion

In this paper, we analyzed the performance of encrypted DNS protocols and conventional DNS from 2,693 Whiteboxes in the United States between April 7th, 2020, and May 8th, 2020. Our findings indicate that clients do not necessarily have to trade DNS performance for privacy. For certain resolvers, DoT can perform faster than conventional DNS in median response times, even as latency increases. We also observed significant variation in DoH performance across recursive resolvers. Based on these results, we recommend that DNS clients (e.g., web browsers) measure latency to resolvers and DNS response times to determine the optimal protocol and resolver for each client. No single DNS protocol or resolver performed best for all clients.

There were some limitations to our study that suggest areas for future research. First, due to bandwidth restrictions, we were unable to perform page loads from Whiteboxes. Future work could utilize platforms similar to SamKnows to measure page loads, such as browser telemetry systems. Second, future studies should include measurements from mobile devices, as DoT was implemented in Android 10, but its performance has not been extensively studied in real-world conditions. Finally, future work could examine how encrypted DNS protocols perform from networks far from popular resolvers, which is particularly important for browser vendors seeking to deploy DoH outside the United States.
