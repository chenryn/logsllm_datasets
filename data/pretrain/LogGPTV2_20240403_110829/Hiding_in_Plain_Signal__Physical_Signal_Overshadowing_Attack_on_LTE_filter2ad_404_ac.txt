to exploit broadcast messages (e.g., SIB messages) that are
refreshed when the serving cell changes. This makes the FBS
attack either limited in terms of attack scope (as exploitable
messages are very limited) or less sustainable in its duration.
3.5.2 MitM attacks
Recently, a new type of FBS attack referred to as the aL-
TEr [37] attack was discovered. This is an MitM attack that
employs an FBS with eNB and UE capabilities. The eNB
component of the FBS impersonates a legitimate eNB by
relaying the messages from the eNB to a victim UE. In addi-
tion, the UE component of the FBS impersonates the victim
UE by relaying the messages from the UE to the eNB. By
sitting between the victim UE and the eNB, the MitM at-
tacker manipulates user plane messages since the messages
are not integrity-protected in LTE. The MitM attack inherits
two aforementioned limitations of the FBS attack, namely,
a high power consumption and low stealthiness, since the
MitM attacker should attract the victim UEs in the same man-
ner. Meanwhile, in principle, the MitM attack does not affect
the connection between the victim UE and the eNB, thereby
making the attack sustainable. However, we noticed that it
is non-trivial to implement an MitM attacker for various rea-
sons. First, to maintain the connection with a victim UE, the
MitM attacker should relay all uplink and downlink messages
exchanged between the victim UE and the eNB. To this end,
the attacker must know the UE’s radio resource settings con-
ﬁgured by the eNB and conﬁgure the radio resource for the
UE accordingly. Otherwise, the radio connection between
the UE and the eNB may become unstable or fail. However,
since the message that contains the radio resource setting
(i.e., RRC reconfiguration) is encrypted, the attacker cannot
properly conﬁgure the UE’s radio resource. We note that the
RRC reconfiguration contains a large number of PHY, MAC,
RLC, and PDCP conﬁgurations for the UE.
To address this issue, the aLTEr attack used the radio conﬁg-
uration in a heuristic manner under the following conditions:
(i) a victim UE receives the service using the default radio
conﬁguration, and (ii) the default radio conﬁguration of an
operator is stable. That is, only a few parameters (e.g., schedul-
ing request (SR) and channel quality indicator (CQI) conﬁgu-
ration) are changed for each radio conﬁguration; whereas the
others are the same. Thus, the attacker only needs to guess
the CQI and SR conﬁgurations. However, in the real world,
the eNB frequently changes the UE’s radio conﬁguration de-
pending on the service that the UE is using and/or the current
channel condition (e.g., initiating carrier aggregation, starting
a Voice/Video call service, service priority, or channel qual-
ity change due to mobility). We observed that when a UE
watched a YouTube video for 2 minutes under a bad chan-

from the attacker, separated by a wall (i.e., non-line of sight). We
refer to the former and the latter as LOS and NLOS, respectively.
nel condition, it received 9 RRC reconfiguration messages
from the eNB, where the length of each message varied from
18 bytes to 109 bytes. Note that, as the attacker is only able
to know the message length and the sequence of message
delivery, it may not correctly guess the conﬁguration. We
also observed that 8 out of 9 messages have different CQI
conﬁgurations which also need to be guessed.
These limitations apply to all MitM attacks, even when the
attacker attempts to manipulate the broadcast message. How-
ever, the SigOver attack does not suffer from such limitations,
as it only utilizes a persistent radio conﬁguration acquired
from the MIB of the legitimate cell (see Section 3.3).
4 Real World Experiment
In this section, we perform SigOver attack in the wild, and
analyze the reliability of the attack.
4.1 Experimental Setup
We implement the SigOver attack based on the pdsch_enodeb,
which contains a basic transmission function as part of
srsLTE [43]. We add a custom-built receive function for
time synchronization with the legitimate cell. The subframes
were crafted using the srsLTE library. Moreover, an USRP
X310 [16] equipped with a UBX [15] daughter board and
GPSDO [14] was employed, which was connected to an Intel
Core i5-3570 machine with an Ubuntu 14.04. To overshadow
the signal from a legitimate eNB, the USRP was augmented
with ZVE-2W-272 ampliﬁer [28], if needed. Victim UEs are
commercial smartphones that camp on a legitimate LTE cell
with a 20MHz bandwidth. In addition, the diagnostic mon-
itor tools (e.g., SCAT and XCAL [8, 42]) were used for the
analysis of the transmitted and received messages at the UE.
Figure 7 illustrates the two locations within a university
ofﬁce, where two sets of experiments were conducted, as
follows: (LOS) The victim UE and the attacker were in the
same room, separated by a distance of 2m. (NLOS) The victim
UE and the attacker were in different rooms separated by a

wall and distance of 10m. These two environments were used
for experiments throughout the study.
Implementation details. An attacker acquires the informa-
tion of the target benign cell (PCI, MIB) using pdsch_ue or
diagnostic tools [8, 42]. She acquires time synchronization
with the target cell (mimicking the procedure for a benign UE
to camp on a cell by getting the PSS/SSS and MIB). After she
obtains the arrival timing and SFN information of the LTE
frame transmitted by the benign cell, she transmits the mali-
cious message to the target SFN. Thereafter, she continuously
receives the PSS/SSS (every 5ms) and MIB (every 10ms)
transmitted by the benign cell and updates the synchroniza-
tion information. Self-interference may cause synchroniza-
tion problems, because Rx and Tx are in the same frequency.
However, due to the precise overshadowing, the SigOver at-
tack can minimize the effects on the legitimate PSS/SSS and
MIB (there was no case of losing synchronization due to the
self-interference).
As a minor issue, the USRP X310 generated an unintended
high peak signal at the beginning and end of the signal when
carrying out a burst transmission which SigOver attack does.
This is due to the state change of the front-end components
of the SDR. When there was no transmission, it was in the
idle state. When transmission occurred, the transition to the
transmitting state caused unwanted noise. We resolve this
problem by simply padding zero to the front and back ends
of the signal to separate the unwanted noise from the original
signal, and by compensating the delay due to the zero padding
during transmission.
Ethical considerations. As the attacker, we use a downward-
facing dome-shaped antenna to minimize upward interference.
In addition, we perform the experiments on the ﬁrst basement
level, which is the lowermost ﬂoor of the building. The base-
ment ﬂoor was restricted during the experiments to prevent
normal users from receiving the crafted signal. The experi-
mental results with respect to the impact of the crafted signal
revealed that the users upstairs and outside the building nor-
mally communicate with the legitimate base station without
being affected by the signal. The signaling storm attack ex-
plained in Section 5.1.1 was run in a carrier’s shielded testbed
network, since the attack may cause a DoS on an operational
network.
4.2 Practicality
In this section, we evaluate the practicality and robustness of
the SigOver attack in the LOS/NLOS environment. We use an
LG G7 ThinQ smartphone with SnapDragon845, which is the
latest Qualcomm LTE chipset. We inject a paging message
with the S-TMSI4 intentionally set as an invalid value of
0xAAAAAAAA, to differentiate the injected subframe from the
legitimate subframes.
4S-TMSI is the shortened form of GUTI.

∗ The FBS sets the same freq. band, PCI, MIB and SIB1 to the legitimate
cell. If the victim UE camped on the FBS within 10s after it operates, the
attack was considered a success. The FBS experiment was run 10 times
for each power level. The SigOver experiment was performed with 100
paging messages for each power level.

Power cost. The SigOver attack exploits the capture effect,
where it injects a stronger signal to overshadow the legitimate
signal, which is at a lower power level. Moreover, we inject
100 paging messages into a victim UE in the RRC Idle state,
and measure the success rate of the attack depending on the
relative power between the injected and legitimate signals in
the LOS environment. Table 2 shows that the SigOver attack
achieves the success rate of 98% at 3 dB.
Attack robustness. Table 3 summarizes the success rates of
the SigOver attack for different combinations of experimen-
tal settings (LOS/NLOS) and RRC states (Idle/Connected).
Each measurement was an average of 120 injected paging
messages. In the RRC Idle state, we inject a paging message
at the exact paging occasion (e.g., Subframe 9) and paging
frame (e.g., SFN%256 = 144) of the victim UE. As discussed
in Section 3.3, in the RRC Idle state, the channel estimation
is carried out solely on the injected signal; whereas in the
RRC Connected state, the average of the channel estimated
from a set of the injected and legitimate signals is consid-
ered. In other words, in the RRC Idle state, injected signals
are individually decoded without the impact of the legitimate
signals; thus successful attacks (i.e., correct decoding) can
be achieved with a single injection. However, in the RRC
Connected state, repeated injection is required to overcome
the inﬂuence of the legitimate signals. To achieve this, we
inject a paging message at the exact paging occasion/frame
of the victim UE. Simultaneously, we also inject a subframe
with RS at every SFN, to reﬂect the channel of the injected
signal and enable a successful attack. As shown in Table 3,
the SigOver attack maintained a success rate greater than 97%
in different RRC states and the LOS and NLOS setups, thus
validating the robustness of the SigOver attack with respect
to operating modes and environmental factors (e.g., multi-
path). Finally, during the experiments the victim UE neither
reported any radio link failures nor initiated radio connection
re-establishment (i.e., RRC Reestablishment request). This
implies that the SigOver attack is non-disruptive to the victim
UE and its service. Furthermore, we verify that the SigOver
attack maintains 100% success rate for over 100 SIB 1 and
SIB 2 messages in the RRC Idle state and LOS setup.

Attack coverage. As described in Section 3.4, a crafted sub-
frame may arrive at victim UE with a slight timing offset due
to the propagation delay of the injected signal from the at-
tacker to the victim UE. The decoding of the crafted subframe
requires the offset to be bounded within the tolerance range
of the UE LTE chipset. Hence, the largest tolerable offset
determines the maximum propagation delay; or equivalently,
the maximum distance between the attacker and the UE (i.e.,
the attack coverage). The attack coverage was experimentally
evaluated, wherein the propagation delay between the attacker
and the UE was emulated by time-shifting the transmission
timings of the crafted subframes. We gradually changed the
shift in the unit of 10 samples (=0.33μs at 30.72Msps), un-
til the crafted subframes were not decoded; which indicates
the maximum delay tolerance. Table 4 presents the tolerance
measured from two smartphones with different basebands –
LG G7 (Qualcomm), and Galaxy S9 (Exynos). The tolerance
offset was consistently higher than 8.66μs across all the de-
vices. With reference to the tolerance-distance relationship
discussed in Section 3.4, the results indicate that the SigOver
attack can cover the entire urban cell (typical radius of 1.5
km) at all times, irrespective of the relative positions of the
UE and attacker.
5 Attack Scenarios and Implications
This section presents several attack scenarios using the
SigOver attack, in addition to their practical implications.
The SigOver attack can be used to exploit two broadcast
messages; SIB and paging. All the attacks were run in the
LOS setup presented in Section 4, with the exception of the
signaling storm attack. To validate the proposed attacks on
the various baseband chipset types, ten LTE capable smart-
phones were employed: one Intel (iPhone XS), six Qualcomm
(Galaxy S4/S8/S9, LG G2/G6/G7), and three Exynos (Galaxy
S6/S8/S9) chipset equipped smartphones.
5.1 Attacks Exploiting SIB
In this section, a discussion on two types of attacks via SIB
injection, namely, signaling storm and selective DoS, is pre-
sented.
5.1.1 Signaling Storm

UE. If the TAC is not included in the list of TACs on the UE,
the UE initiates a TAU procedure to notify the LTE network
of the updated TAC. The SigOver attack incurs the signaling
storm by repeatedly triggering invalid TAU. Figure 8 illus-
trates the attack process when compared with the normal (i.e.,
without attack) operation. The attacker ﬁrst overshadows a
paging message with the system_Info_Modification ﬁeld set
as true, thus forcing the UEs to read SIB1. The SIB1 is then
overshadowed using a spoofed TAC, thus leading to the TAU.
It should be noted that the TAU request messages are directed
to the legitimate eNB, because the SigOver attack preserves
the radio connection between the victim and the legitimate
eNB. Repeating this procedure results in the signaling storm
on the LTE network. On the contrary, under normal circum-
stances, the TAU is performed only once each time the UE
moves to another TA not included in the TAI list.
Validation. This attack was validated using a carrier’s testbed
LTE network with nine LTE devices6 registered to the testbed
network. Each device was running the diagnostic monitor
tools (e.g., SCAT, XCAL [8, 42]) for the analysis of the UE-
side signaling messages throughout the attack. Figure 9 re-
veals that a single UE carries out an average of seven TAU
procedures per second, which is unlikely under the normal
conditions without the attack. Moreover, the UE-side signal-
ing messages were analyzed to better understand the behavior
of the network under the attack. When the victim UE carries
out the TAU with the spoofed TAC (irrespective of the validity
of the TAC value), the network returns the same list of TACs
