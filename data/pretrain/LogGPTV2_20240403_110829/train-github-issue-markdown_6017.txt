Hello there.
Doing a right click on a flash object opens up a context menu as expected, but
the positioning in 2.0.0-beta.1 is wrong. This happens on both 32-bit and
64-bit builds for Windows and also on Ubuntu 64-bit.
The positioning is correct in v1.8.2.
Additional info:  
Windows 7 x64  
Flash Player: 28.0.0.161
Minimal app for reproducing (win-64bit and linux-64bit):
