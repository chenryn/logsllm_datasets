### Title: Botconf 2016 - Browser-based Malware: Evolution and Prevention

In today's digital landscape, web technologies have revolutionized the way we work and interact online. Cloud services, social networks, and online games are increasingly popular, often replacing traditional desktop applications and offline activities. Web browsers, enhanced with a variety of extensions and plugins, offer users a wide range of functionalities. However, this has also made them an attractive target for cybercriminals, who have developed new methods to exploit these platforms, spread malware, and maximize their illicit gains.

The history of browser-based malware can be traced back to "Man-in-the-Browser" (MITB) attacks. This technique was first mentioned in 2005 by Augusto Paes de Barros in his presentation, "The Future of Backdoors â€“ Worst of All Worlds." Initially, MITB attacks were used by well-known banking trojans such as Zeus and SpyEye to steal bank account credentials and intercept transactions in e-banking systems. These malicious programs would patch the browser's processes to hijack data buffers before they were transmitted over the network to the web resource. Each time the browser was updated, cybercriminals had to reverse-engineer the changes and update their malware accordingly.

However, the landscape has evolved. Today, it is much simpler to develop a basic browser extension that injects JavaScript into every webpage a user visits. Such scripts can check the URL in the browser tab and modify behavior based on the site. For example, in search engines, they can insert additional advertising banners; in email services, they can add text to user messages; and in online banking, they can perform web injections to hijack transactions.

In this presentation, we will explore the latest implementation and distribution techniques of "Man-in-the-Browser" attacks. We will highlight several interesting samples, their functionalities, and the monetization models employed by cybercriminals. Our findings are based on real-world examples, providing valuable insights into the current state of browser-based malware and effective prevention strategies.
