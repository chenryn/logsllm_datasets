User: I'm working on a Django project that requires debugging on a multithreaded server. I've found mod_wsgi 2.0+ to be the easiest to work with, because of easy workarounds for python module reloading. Problem is can't get it to compile on Leopard. Is there anyone who has managed to do it so far, either for the builtin Apache or MAMP. I'd be grateful if someone posts a link to a precompiled binary (for intel, python 2.5, apache 2.2 or 2.0).

After 3 hours of trial and error I've managed to compile mod_wsgi 2.3 for the Apache that comes with Leopard. Here are the instructions in case anyone else needs this.

./configure
Change 2 lines in the Makefile
CFLAGS =  -Wc,'-arch i386'
LDFLAGS =  -arch i386 -Wl,-F/Library/Frameworks -framework Python -u _PyMac_Error
make && sudo make install
Make a thin binary of the original httpd
cd /usr/sbin 
sudo mv ./httpd ./httpd.fat 
sudo lipo ./httpd.fat -thin i386 -output ./httpd.i386 
sudo ln -s ./httpd.i386 ./httpd

This should work on intel macbook, macbook pro, imac and mac mini. As I understood the problem is modwsgi won't compile against MacPython 2.5.2 because of some weird architecture missmatch problem. But, if you compile it as a thin binary it won't play with the Apache fat binary. So this hack solves the problem. The rest is pretty standard configuration, like on any other platform.
Assistant: This doesn't directly answer your question, but have you thought about using something like MacPorts for this sort of thing? If you're compiling a lot of software like this, MacPorts can really make your life easier, since building software and dependencies is practically automatic.
