User: Explain what Load Balancing is and explain its importance for large websites.
Assistant: Load balancing is a technology that evenly distributes network traffic to multiple servers to ensure high availability and reliability of network services. It improves response speed and reduces request waiting time by distributing traffic to multiple servers to avoid single server overload or failure. For large websites, load balancing is critical. When website traffic increases, a single server cannot satisfy all requests, resulting in slower website speed, poor availability, and even crashes. Using load balancing can distribute traffic to multiple servers to ensure that the website is always stable and available, and improve the performance and reliability of the website. In addition, load balancing can also optimize performance and stability issues in specific scenarios such as cross-regional access. Therefore, load balancing plays a vital role in the architecture of large websites.
