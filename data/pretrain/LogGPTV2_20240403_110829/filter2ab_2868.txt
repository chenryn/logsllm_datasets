**ATT&CK ID:** S1010  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** VPNFilter

The `ssler` module of the VPNFilter malware configures the device's `iptables` to redirect all traffic destined for port 80 (HTTP) to a local service listening on port 8888. As a result, any outgoing web requests on port 80 are intercepted by the `ssler` module. These intercepted requests can then be inspected and potentially manipulated by the `ps` module before being forwarded to the intended HTTP service.
