threats may be in practice.
The impact of using TTI is especially apparent when
trying to gain insights into the targeted malware that
poses the biggest risk to CSOs. Table 4 shows the top
5 malware families we observe in terms of technical so-
phistication and in terms of TTI score. If we consider the
malware families with the highest technical sophistica-
tion, we can see that their TTI values are relatively low,
with maximums ranging from 1.5 to 4.5. These tend to be
malware families that are familiar to researchers. In par-
ticular, PlugX and PoisonIvy have been used in targeted
attacks together [43] and PlugX is still actively used and
under constant development [16]. Despite technical so-
phistication, the social engineering lures of these threats
are not well crafted and pose less of a risk to the CSOs
whose members may be able to identify and avoid these
threats.
In contrast, the top 5 malware families in terms of
TTI have lower technical sophistication (1.25) but much
higher levels of social engineering. It is no surprise that
threats which score the highest TTI use well known mal-
ware that have been extensively documented in attacks
against a variety of targets. For example, the TTI scores
reﬂect that Gh0st RAT continues to be seen in higher
risk attacks due to its popularity amongst attackers even
though it is an older and not particularly advanced tool.
Since there is no direct connection between the technical
sophistication of threats and the level of social engineer-
ing used to target CSOs, it is likely that different threat
actors, with a different focus, are at work here. Indeed,
Gh0st RAT was discovered by the Citizen Lab in their
analysis of GhostNet [25] and IEXPL0RE RAT was dis-
covered and named for the ﬁrst time in our work.
Another observation is that commercial malware such
as FinFisher and DaVinci RCS, while being of much
higher technical sophistication (relative to the samples in

our study), do not necessarily score higher on TTI than
a targeted attack with advanced social engineering and
more basic malware. For example, analyzing a FinFisher
sample targeted against Bahraini activists [38] with the
TTI, produces an overall TTI score that is dependent on
the social targeting aspect, even though the malware is
very technically advanced. In this case, the FinFisher at-
tack scores 4.0 on the TTI (base targeting score of 2 with
a technical multiplier of 2). Although the email used
in the attack references the name and organization of a
real journalist, the content is poorly customized, and has
attributes that look questionable. However, the techni-
cal sophistication of the malware is advanced earning it
a score of 2 due to multiple advanced protection tech-
niques, including a custom-written virtualized packer,
MBR modiﬁcation, and rootkit functionality. The sample
also uses multiple minor forms of protection, including
at least half a dozen anti-debugging tricks. Even though
the technical multiplier is the maximum value, the over-
all TTI score is only 4.0 due to the low targeting base
value. FinFisher is only effective if it is surreptitiously
installed on a users’ computer. If the malware is deliv-
ered through an email attachment, infection is only suc-
cessful if the user opens the malicious ﬁle. The advanced
nature of this malware will cause the overall score to in-
crease quickly with improved targeting, but as it still re-
quires user intervention, this threat scores lower overall
than attacks with highly targeted social engineering us-
ing less sophisticated malware.
Similar ﬁndings can also be observed in attacks using
DaVinci RCS developed by Italy-based company Hack-
ing Team against activists and independent media groups
from the United Arab Emirates and Morocco [36]. While
the malware used in these publicly reported attacks is

technically sophisticated, the social engineering lures
employed are poorly customized for the targets result-
ing in a 4.0 TTI score (targeting base value 2, technical
multiplier 2).
These results support the idea that different threat ac-
tors have varying focuses and levels of resources, and
as a result, different methodologies for attacks. For ex-
ample, the majority of malware submitted by our study
groups appear to be from adversaries that have in-house
malware development capabilities and the capacity to
organize and implement targeted malware campaigns.
These adversaries are spending signiﬁcant effort on so-
cial engineering, but generally do not use technically
advanced malware. Conversely, the adversaries using
FinFisher and DaVinci RCS have bought these products
rather than develop malware themselves. However, while
the FinFisher and RCS samples are technically sophisti-
cated pieces of malware, the attacks we analyzed are not
sophisticated in terms of social engineering tactics.
4.5 Limitations of TTI
While the Targeted Threat Index gives insight into the
distribution of how sophisticated threats are, we are still
in the process of evaluating and reﬁning it through in-
teractions with the groups in our study and inclusion of
more sophisticated threats observed in related investiga-
tions in our lab. Average TTI scores in our dataset may
be skewed due to the self-reporting method we use in the
study. Very good threats are less likely to be noticed and
reported while being sent to far fewer people, and low-
quality emails are much more likely to be sent in bulk
and stand out. It is also possible that individuals in differ-
ent groups may be more diligent in submitting samples,
which could affect between group comparisons. We are
more interested, however, in worst-case (highest) scores
and not in comparing the average threat severity between
organizations.
Finally, this metric is calculated based on the technical
sophistication of the payload, not on the speciﬁc exploit.
There is currently no method to modify the TTI score in
a way similar to the temporal metrics used by the CVSS
metric. A temporal metric could be added to increase
the ﬁnal TTI value for 0-day vulnerabilities, or possibly
to reduce the score for exploits that are easily detectable
due to a public and well-known generation script, e.g.
Metasploit [2].

Implications
Our study primarily focuses on threats that groups work-
ing on human rights issues related to Tibet or China are
currently facing. While our dataset is concentrated on
these types of groups, our results have implications for
how CSOs can protect themselves against email-based
targeted malware.
Speciﬁcally, we ﬁnd that moving towards cloud-based
platforms (e.g., Google Docs) instead of relying on e-
mail attachments would prevent more than 95% of the
e-mail malware seen by 2 out of 3 Tibetan groups that
had more than 50 e-mail submissions.
Further, our results highlight the potential for lower-
cost user education initiatives to guard against sophis-
ticated social engineering attacks, rather than high cost
technical solutions. This observation stems from the fact
that much of the malware we observe is not technically
sophisticated, but rather relies on social engineering to
deliver its payload by convincing users to open malicious
attachments or links. Other studies [35, 36, 38] that have
revealed the use of commercial malware products against
CSOs and journalists have shown that many of these
cases also rely on duping users into opening malicious
e-mail attachments or social engineered instant messag-
ing conversations. These incidents show that even ad-
vanced targeted malware requires successful exploitation
of users through social engineering tactics.
User education can be a powerful tool against the
kinds of targeted attacks we observed in this study. In-
deed, the Tibetan community has taken an active ap-
proach with campaigns that urge Tibetan users to not
send or open attachments and suggests alternative cloud
based options such as Google Docs and Dropbox for
sharing documents [53]. We have also engaged the Ti-
betan groups in a series of workshops to introduce train-
ing curriculum which draws on examples submitted by
organizations participating in our study. We have also
provided them with technical background to identify sus-
picious e-mail headers and how to use free services to
check the validity of suspicious links in e-mail messages.
The mitigation strategies presented here are focused
on email vectors and do not consider all of the possible
attacks these groups may face. We highlight these strate-
gies in particular because the majority of groups in our
study identiﬁed document-based targeted malware as a
high priority information security concern. The adver-
saries behind these attacks are highly motivated and will
likely adapt their tactics as users change their behaviors.
For example, it is plausible that if every user in a partic-
ular community began to avoid opening attachments and
document-based malware infected fewer targets, attack-
ers may move on to vectors such as waterhole attacks or
attacks on cloud document platforms to ﬁll the gap. User
education and awareness raising activities need to be on-
going efforts that are informed by current research on the
state of threats particular communities are experiencing.
Evaluation of the effectiveness of user education efforts
in at risk communities and corresponding reactions from
attackers is required to understand the dynamics between

6 Related Work
There is a wide body of literature on ﬁltering and detec-
tion methods for spam [27,42,45,52,70,71] and phishing
emails and websites [12, 34, 39, 69]. Attention has also
been given to evaluating user behavior around phishing
attacks and techniques for evading them [6, 30, 33]. By
comparison research on detecting email vectors used for
targeted malware attacks is limited. A notable excep-
tion is [4, 5], which uses threat and recipient features
with a random forest classiﬁer to detect targeted mali-
cious emails in a dataset from a large Fortune 500 com-
pany. Other work has focused on imporoving detection
of documents (e.g. PDF, Microsoft Ofﬁce) with embed-
ded malicious code [13, 51, 57]
Another area of research explores methods for model-
ing the stages of targeted attacks and using these mod-
els to develop defenses. Guira and Wang [19] propose
a conceptual attack model called the attack pyramid to
model targeted attacks and identify features that can be
detected at the various stages. Hutchins, Cloppert and
Amin, [24] use a kill chain model to track targeted at-
tack campaigns and inform defensive strategies.
Metrics have been developed to characterize security
vulnerabilities and their severity [7, 41, 50]. The indus-
try standard is the Common Vulnerability Scoring Sys-
tem (CVSS)
[17], which uses three metric groups for
characterizing vulnerabilities and their impacts. These
groups are: base metric group (the intrinsic and fun-
damental characteristics of a vulnerability that are con-
stant over time and user environments), temporal metric
group (characteristics of a vulnerability that change over
time but not among user environments) and environmen-
tal metric group (characteristics of a vulnerability that
are relevant and unique to a particular user’s environ-
ment). The CVSS is a widely adopted metric, but only
rates technical vulnerabilities. Targeted attacks rely on a
user action of opening a malicious attachment or visiting
a malicious link to successfully compromise a system.
Therefore, the sophistication of message lures and other
social engineering tactics are an important part of deter-
mining the severity of a targeted attack. Systems like the
CVSS cannot address this contextual component.
Our study makes the following contributions to the
literature. Previous studies of targeted attacks against
CSOs usually focus on particular incidents or campaigns
and do not include longitudinal observations of attacks
against a range of CSO targets. While standards exist
