User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Should I be worried of tracking domains on a banking website? Finland's largest bank OP (former Osuuspankki) has added tracking domains (all three owned by Adobe) in their website redesign:



These domains are loaded when signed in:

2o7.net
demdex.net
omtrdc.net


Is this considered acceptable? What information can third-party domains gather on my bank account activity?

Assistant: It looks like the main site is embedding script from Adobe Marketing Cloud directly into the page. While these scripts are loaded from the same server as the main site it looks like that these scripts communicate with external servers using XHR and also download new script from demdex.net and 2o7.net according to the logs of uBlock Origin.

Especially the loading and executing of new scripts from a third party outside the control of your bank is a huge security problem. Essentially these scripts can get full control over the web site, including reading what you enter, changing submitted or displayed content etc. These are essentially cross site scripting, only that they did not happen by accident but the developers of the banking site explicitly invited  these third parties to do cross site scripting.

While such use of third party services might be acceptable on a site where no sensitive information is entered, it is absolutely not acceptable whenever sensitive information is transferred or when it unexpectedly changes to the content of a web site (like showing a different account balance) and might cause unwanted actions from the visitor.
