### Concerns Regarding Tracking Domains on a Banking Website

You have raised an important question about the presence of tracking domains on a banking website, specifically Finland's largest bank, OP (formerly Osuuspankki). The tracking domains in question are:

- 2o7.net
- demdex.net
- omtrdc.net

These domains are owned by Adobe and are loaded when you sign into the bank's website. 

### Is This Acceptable?

The use of third-party tracking domains, even those owned by reputable companies like Adobe, can be concerning, especially on a banking website where sensitive financial information is handled. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Data Privacy**: Third-party domains can gather various types of data, including:
   - User behavior (e.g., pages visited, time spent on each page)
   - Device information (e.g., browser type, screen resolution)
   - Personal information (if not properly anonymized)

2. **Security Risks**: 
   - **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: The scripts from these domains can potentially execute code that has access to the entire web page, including any sensitive information you enter.
   - **Content Manipulation**: These scripts can modify the content displayed on the page, which could lead to misleading or fraudulent information being presented to the user.

3. **Trust and Compliance**:
   - **User Trust**: Customers expect their financial institutions to handle their data with the highest level of security and privacy. The presence of third-party trackers may erode this trust.
   - **Regulatory Compliance**: Depending on the jurisdiction, there may be legal and regulatory requirements regarding the handling and protection of personal and financial data. The use of third-party trackers must comply with these regulations, such as GDPR in the European Union.

### Analysis of the Scripts

Based on your observations, it appears that the main site is embedding scripts from Adobe Marketing Cloud directly into the page. These scripts communicate with external servers using XHR (XMLHttpRequest) and also download additional scripts from `demdex.net` and `2o7.net`.

- **XHR Requests**: These requests can send and receive data from the external servers, potentially including sensitive information.
- **Dynamic Script Loading**: The loading and execution of new scripts from a third party outside the control of the bank can be a significant security risk. These scripts can gain full control over the web page, including reading and modifying user input and displayed content.

### Conclusion

While the use of third-party services for analytics and marketing purposes might be acceptable on less sensitive websites, it is generally not advisable on a banking website. The potential risks to data privacy and security outweigh the benefits of enhanced analytics.

If you are concerned about this, you may want to:
- **Contact the Bank**: Reach out to OP Bank to express your concerns and inquire about their data handling and security practices.
- **Use Security Tools**: Consider using browser extensions like uBlock Origin to block these third-party scripts, although this may affect the functionality of the website.
- **Monitor Your Accounts**: Regularly review your account statements and activity for any unauthorized transactions.

It is crucial for financial institutions to prioritize the security and privacy of their customers' data, and the use of third-party tracking should be carefully evaluated and minimized.
