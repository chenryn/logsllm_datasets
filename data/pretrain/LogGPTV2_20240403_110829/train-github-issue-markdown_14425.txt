**Current behavior**  
There is no way how to get the value of 'formControlName' inside a custom
validation function to identify which control is beeing actually validated
(model-driven forms) because the only parameter is (c: FormControl) and the
actual API of 'FormControl' is:
    _errors, _onChange, _parent, _pristine, _status, _statusChanges, _touched,
    _value, _valueChanges, asyncValidator, dirty, errors, pending, pristine,
    root, status, statusChanges, touched, untouched, valid, validator, value, valueChanges
**Expected/desired behavior**  
Be able to get 'formControlName' value inside a custom validation and generic
function and use it as the identity of the actually validated control. It
allows to have a dynamic set of validation rules for each control (for example
in JSON syntax) that could be maintenated outside of the app code then.
**What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**  
To be more flexible and minimize the code = reducing the number of custom
validators.
