User: I have a need to execute PERL scripts through a Django web interface.
The user will select the parameters of the script and execute it.
I am wondering if it is possible to use Celery/RabbitMQ to execute these script as Celery tasks?
If so, would I need to modify the PERL script? 
Would I have to write RabbitMQ code into the PERL scripts? Or would I just execute the Celery task and wait for the script to finish processing? I would like to have the script update the Django user/celery.
Assistant: The easiest way to execute a Perl script from Celery would probably be a thin wrapper written in Python that runs the script as a subprocess.
