User: I am running python 2.7 + bottle on cygwin and I wanted to access a sample webpage from chrome.
I am unable to access the website running on http://localhost:8080/hello but when I do a curl within cygwin I am able to access it.
Error Message when accessing through Chrome
Connection refused
Description: Connection refused
Please let me know how I can access my local bottle website running inside Cygwin from windows  browser.
Assistant: Since you get a connection refused error, the best I can think of is that this is a browser issue. Try editing the LAN settings on your Chrome browser to bypass proxy server for local address.
