### Issue Description
I am experiencing an issue with a `Dialog` component that is triggered by the `onClick` event of a `MenuItem`. The dialog opens correctly, but it fails to close properly when I click on the backdrop or the close button. This issue only occurs when a transition (e.g., Slide) is used.

I have searched the repository's issues and believe this is not a duplicate.

### Expected Behavior
The dialog should close correctly, and the UI should return to its previous state, allowing interaction with other elements.

### Current Behavior
When attempting to close the dialog, the CSS classes and the DOM modal element are not removed. As a result, the rest of the UI becomes unresponsive and unclickable.

*Element created by the dialog but not removed on close*

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Open the `Dialog` by clicking on the `MenuItem`.
2. Attempt to close the dialog by clicking on the backdrop or the close button.
3. Observe that the dialog does not close, and the rest of the UI remains unclickable.

### Context
This issue renders the UI unusable, as users cannot interact with other elements once the dialog is opened. The ability to toggle dialogs from menus is a critical feature for our application.

#### Environment
- **Material-UI:** 1.0.0-beta.19
- **React:** 16.0.0
- **Browsers:** Firefox, Chrome, Safari (all most recent releases)
- **Operating Systems:** macOS 13.10.31.1, Windows 10
