I have a `Dialog` component being triggered by onClick of a `MenuItem`. It
opens correctly. But when I try to close the dialog (either via click on
backdrop or on close button) the dialog is not correctly dismissed.  
**This only happens if you use a transition (Slide).**
  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
I would expect the modal to be closed correctly. üòÅ
## Current Behavior
The CSS classes and the DOM modal element aren't removed, so the rest of the
sites UI is not clickable anymore.

## Context
This problem makes the UI not useable anymore. I think it is a mandatory
feature to toggle dialogs from menus.
