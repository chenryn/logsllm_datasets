Can be reproduced by adding and testing DFTK.jl on 1.7 beta.  
The issue appears to happen when we run a computation in Float64 precision
then run it again in Float32.  
I hesitated to post this since this is pretty far from a MWE, but I have zero
idea how to reduce this and since 1.7 is in beta I figured it could be of
interest.
