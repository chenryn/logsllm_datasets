The issue can be reproduced by adding and testing DFTK.jl on Julia 1.7 beta. Specifically, the problem seems to occur when a computation is first run in `Float64` precision and then rerun in `Float32` precision.

I was hesitant to post this because it is far from a minimal working example (MWE). However, given that I am unable to reduce the problem further and considering that Julia 1.7 is still in beta, I thought it might be of interest to the community.
