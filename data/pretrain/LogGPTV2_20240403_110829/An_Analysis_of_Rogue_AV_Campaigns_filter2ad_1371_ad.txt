### Impact of P2P Traffic on Anomaly Detection

#### 4.3 ROCs for Different Attack Classes and Rates

Figure 3 shows the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves for different attack classes and rates. The results for TRW-CB in flooding attacks are omitted because it had a 0% detection rate due to the random source IP address spoofing used in these attacks.

- **NETAD Performance:**
  - NETAD's performance does not degrade for flooding attacks when P2P traffic is introduced.
  - However, its accuracy degrades for port scans.

- **Maximum Entropy Performance:**
  - The performance penalty for Maximum Entropy in case of flooding attacks is more significant than for port scans.
  - This difference is primarily due to the varying design principles of these anomaly detectors.
  - Flooding attacks are detected by NETAD because they target lower ports, while P2P communication typically uses higher ports.
  - Maximum Entropy detector's accuracy degrades because P2P traffic on higher ports increases the variance and entropy of the port distribution, leading to a large number of false positives from windows containing P2P activity.

- **Impact on Low- and High-Rate Attacks:**
  - From Figure 3, it is observed that the detection of low-rate attacks is more seriously affected than high-rate attacks.
  - P2P traffic inadvertently acts as an effective evasion cover for low-rate attacks.
  - For high-rate attacks, the cover is less effective when the sustained attack connection rate overwhelms the short-term P2P connection burst.

#### 4.4 Can an Anomaly Detector Handle P2P Traffic if It Is Trained on a Dataset Containing P2P Traffic?

Our performance evaluations have indicated that P2P traffic adversely affects the accuracies of all anomaly detectors. We investigate whether training a detector on P2P traffic can mitigate this effect. To this end, we develop training sets with varying proportions of P2P traffic (40-80%) and train NETAD and Maximum Entropy on these sets. TRW-CB and Rate Limiting do not require training and are thus not evaluated in this context.

- **Results:**
  - Training Maximum Entropy on P2P traffic degrades its accuracy and increases its false positive rate.
  - For NETAD, although there is an increase in detection rate, a 30% increase in false positive rate is induced as the amount of P2P traffic in the training set increases.
  - This is mainly because P2P clients communicate with each peer on different ports, making it difficult to define effective filtering rules for NETAD or derive a robust baseline distribution for Maximum Entropy.
  - Therefore, training these anomaly detectors on P2P traffic does not mitigate the torrent effect, as contemporary detectors are not designed to filter or incorporate the peculiarities of P2P protocols and clients.

#### 5. Mitigating the Torrent Effect

Based on the empirical accuracy results, we discuss how to make an anomaly detector resilient to P2P traffic. While the ideal method is to avoid detection features that overlap between malicious and P2P traffic, we also discuss a pragmatic solution for existing IDSs.

#### 5.1 Can a Pragmatic Solution Be Designed to Make an Anomaly Detector Insensitive to P2P Traffic?

- **Causes of the Torrent Effect:**
  - The torrent effect is caused by the initiation of a large number of connections by P2P applications and failed connection attempts.
  - This behavior is due to the lack of a central repository in P2P networks and the need for robustness with high churn rates.
  - P2P applications perform relentless attempts to establish connections, which overlaps with malicious behavior.

- **Proposed Solution:**
  - A simple solution to mitigate the torrent effect is to filter P2P traffic at the input of an anomaly detector using a P2P traffic classifier.
  - This will segregate non-P2P and P2P traffic, allowing the IDS to operate only on the non-P2P traffic.
  - Since contemporary IDSs are designed to work with non-P2P traffic, detection in the segregated non-P2P traffic will be based on unique and non-overlapping characteristics of malicious traffic, yielding better accuracies.
  - This solution requires no changes to existing IDSs but adds complexity through the integration of a generic P2P traffic classification pre-processor.

- **Challenges:**
  - The accuracy of the IDS is closely tied to the accuracy of the P2P traffic classifier.
  - Attacks embedded within P2P traffic will not be detected.
  - The next section will address the second point, while the current subsection focuses on the first point: Can existing public P2P traffic classifiers be used effectively?

This structured approach provides a clear and professional overview of the impact of P2P traffic on anomaly detection and the proposed solutions to mitigate the torrent effect.
