The Google search engine found at www.google.com offers many different features
including language and document translation, web, image, newsgroups, catalog and
news searches and more. These features offer obvious benefits to even the most
uninitiated web surfer, but these same features allow for far more nefarious possibilities
to the most malicious Internet users including hackers, computer criminals, identity
thieves and even terrorists.  This paper outlines the more nefarious applications of the
Google search engine, techniques that have collectively been termed “Google hacking.”
The intent of this paper is to educate web administrators and the security community in
the hopes of eventually securing this form of information leakage.
This document outlines the techniques that Google hackers can employ. This document
does not serve as a clearinghouse for all known techniques or searches. The
googledorks database, located at http://johnny.ihackstuff.com should be consulted for
information on all known attack searches.
Google search techniques
Google web interface
The Google search engine is fantastically easy to use. Despite the simplicity, it is very
important to have a firm grasp of these basic techniques in order to fully comprehend the
more advanced uses. The most basic Google search can involve a single word entered
into the search page found at www.google.com.
Figure 1: The main Google search page
As shown in Figure 1, I have entered the word “sardine” into the search screen. Figure 1
shows many of the options available from the www.google.com front page.
The Google toolbar
The Internet Explorer browser I am using has a Google
“toolbar” (a free download from toolbar.google.com) installed
and presented under the address bar. Although the toolbar
offers many different features, it is not a required element for
performing advanced searches. Even the most advanced
search functionality is available to any user able to access the
www.google.com web page with any type of browser, including
text-based and mobile browsers.

and presented under the address bar. Although the toolbar
offers many different features, it is not a required element for
performing advanced searches. Even the most advanced
search functionality is available to any user able to access the
www.google.com web page with any type of browser, including
text-based and mobile browsers.
“Web, Images,
Groups, Directory and
News” tabs
These tabs allow you to search web pages, photographs,
message group postings, Google directory listings, and news
stories respectively. First-time Google users should consider
that these tabs are not always a replacement for the “Submit
Search” button.
Search term input field
Located directly below the alternate search tabs, this text field
allows the user to enter a Google search term. Search term
rules will be described later.
“Submit Search”
This button submits the search term supplied by the user. In
many browsers, simply pressing the “Enter/Return” key after
typing a search term will activate this button.
“I’m Feeling Lucky”
Instead of presenting a list of search results, this button will
forward the user to the highest-ranked page for the entered
search term. Often times, this page is the most relevant page
for the entered search term.
“Advanced Search”
This link takes the user to the “Advanced Search” page as
shown in Figure 2. Much of the advanced search functionality is
accessible from this page. Some advanced features are not
listed on this page.
“Preferences”
This link allows the user to select several options (which are
stored in cookies on the user’s machine for later retrieval)
including languages, filters, number of results per page, and
window options.
“Language tools”
This link allows the user to set many different language options
and translate text to and from various languages.

Figure 2: Advanced Search page
Once a user submits a search by clicking the “Submit Search” button or by pressing
enter in the search term input box, a results page may be displayed as shown in Figure
3.
Figure 3: A basic Google search results page.
The search results page allows the user to explore the search results in various ways.
Top line
The top line (found under the alternate search tabs) lists the
search query, the number of hits displayed and found, and
how long the search took.

search query, the number of hits displayed and found, and
how long the search took.
“Category” link
This link takes you to the Google directory category for the
search you entered. The Google directory is a highly
organized directory of the web pages that Google monitors.
Main page link
This link takes you directly to a web page. Figure 3 shows
this as “Sardine Factory :: Home page”
Description
The short description of a site
Cached link
This link takes you to Google’s copy of this web page. This
is very handy if a web page changes or goes down.
“Similar Pages”
This link takes to you similar pages based on the Google
category.
“Sponsored Links”
coluimn
This column lists pay targeted advertising links based on
your search query.
Under certain circumstances, a blank error page (See Figure 4) may be presented
instead of the search results page. This page is the catchall error page, which generally
means Google encountered a problem with the submitted search term. Many times this
means that a search query option was not entered properly.
Figure 4: The "blank" error page
In addition to the “blank” error page, another error page may be presented as shown in
Figure 5. This page is much more descriptive, informing the user that a search term was
missing. This message indicates that the user needs to add to the search query.

There is a great deal more to Google’s web-based search functionality which is not
covered in this paper.
Basic search techniques
Simple word searches
Basic Google searches, as I have already presented, consist of one or more
words entered without any quotations or the use of special keywords.  Examples:
peanut butter
butter peanut
olive oil popeye
 ‘+’ searches
When supplying a list of search terms, Google automatically tries to find every
word in the list of terms, making the Boolean operator “AND” redundant. Some
search engines may use the plus sign as a way of signifying a Boolean “AND”.
Google uses the plus sign in a different fashion. When Google receives a basic
search request that contains a very common word like “the”, “how” or “where”,
the word will often times be removed from the query as shown in Figure 6.
Figure 6: Google removing overly common words
The Google Hacker’s Guide

- Page 8 -
In order to force Google to include a common word, precede the search term with
a plus (+) sign. Do not use a space between the plus sign and the search term.
For example, the following searches produce slightly different results:
where quick brown fox
+where quick brown fox
The ‘+’ operator can also be applied to Google advanced operators, discussed
below.
‘-‘ searches
Excluding a term from a search query is as simple as placing a minus sign (-)
before the term. Do not use a space between the minus sign and the search
term. For example, the following searches produce slightly different results:
quick brown fox
quick –brown fox
The ‘-’ operator can also be applied to Google advanced operators, discussed
below.

Phrase Searches
In order to search for a phrase, supply the phrase surrounded by double-quotes.
Examples:
“the quick brown fox”
“liberty and justice for all”
“harry met sally”
Arguments to Google advanced operators can be phrases enclosed in quotes, as
described below.
Mixed searches
Mixed searches can involve both phrases and individual terms. Example:
macintosh "microsoft office"
This search will only return results that include the phrase “Microsoft office” and
the term macintosh.
Google advanced operators
Google allows the use of certain operators to help refine searches. The use of advanced
operators is very simple as long as attention is given to the syntax. The basic format is:
operator:search_term
Notice that there is no space between the operator, the colon and the search term. If a
space is used after a colon, Google will display an error message. If a space is used
before the colon, Google will use your intended operator as a search term.
Some advanced operators can be used as a standalone query. For example
‘cache:www.google.com’ can be submitted to Google as a valid search query. The
‘site’ operator, by contrast, must be used along with a search term, such as
‘site:www.google.com help’.

site: find web pages on a specific web site
This advanced operator instructs Google to restrict a search to a specific web site or
domain. When using this operator, an addition search argument is required.
Example:
site:harvard.edu tuition
This query will return results from harvard.edu that include the term tuition anywhere on
the page.
filetype: search only within files of a specific type.
This operator instructs Google to search only within the text of a particular type of file.
This operator requires an additional search argument.
Example:
filetype:txt endometriosis
This query searches for the word ‘endometriosis’ within standard text documents. There
should be no period (.) before the filetype and no space around the colon following the
word “filetype”. It is important to note thatGoogle only claims to be able to search within
certain types of files. Based on my experience, Google can search within most files that
present as plain text. For example, Google can easily find a word within a file of type
“.txt,” “.html” or “.php” since the output of these files in a typical web browser window is
textual. By contrast, while a WordPerfect document may look like text when opened with
the WordPerfect application, that type of file is not recognizable to the standard web
browser without special plugins and by extension, Google can not interpret the
document properly, making a search within that document impossible. Thankfully,
Google can search within specific type of special files, making a search like
“filetype:doc endometriosis“ a valid one.
The current list of files that Google can search is listed in the filetype FAQ located at
http://www.google.com/help/faq_filetypes.html. As of this writing, Google can search
within the following file types:
• 
Adobe Portable Document Format (pdf)
• 
Adobe PostScript (ps)
• 
Lotus 1-2-3 (wk1, wk2, wk3, wk4, wk5, wki, wks, wku)
• 
Lotus WordPro (lwp)
• 
MacWrite (mw)
• 
Microsoft Excel (xls)
• 
Microsoft PowerPoint (ppt)
• 
Microsoft Word (doc)
• 
Microsoft Works (wks, wps, wdb)
• 
Microsoft Write (wri)
