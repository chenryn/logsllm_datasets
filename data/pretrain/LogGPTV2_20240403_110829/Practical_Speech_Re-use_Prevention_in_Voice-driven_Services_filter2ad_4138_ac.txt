Distance. Distance between a VDS user and VDS input impacts
imperceptibility of the acoustic nonce. Figure 6b indicates that this
distance is inversely proportional to SPL.
Background Noise. Figure 5c and Equation 1 suggest that the back-
ground noise is proportional to BER. In an environment with high
background noise, the nonce generation and embedding parameters
need to be configured appropriately (e.g., decrease bitrate, increase
amplitude) to limit the BER.
4.3 Mathematical Formulation
To address reliability and imperceptibility simultaneously, we model
over-the-air acoustic nonce transmission as an optimization prob-
lem. Let a user’s recited speech be denoted by x, and the acoustic
nonce embedded by AEOLUS be δ. Also, let the function that ac-
counts for variations induced by over-the-air channel, e.g., due
to acoustic signal air absorption and distance, be h(·). The speech
recorded by the microphone is thus represented as h(x). When δ
is embedded at the time of user interaction with the VDS, x mixes
with δ. As a result, the microphone records h(x∗δ), where ∗ denotes
signal convolution between x and δ.
Assume that AEOLUS detects nonce δ′ in h(x ∗ δ). Let us define
an objective function f (·) denoting BER that takes the parameter
set P = {, ...} as input, and a function д(·) denoting
SPL. The goal is to find the optimal parameter set P that minimizes
f (for reliability) subject to the constraint that the SPL difference
between speech with and without embedded nonce is less than or
equal to a threshold θ (for imperceptibility):
arg minP f (P) subject to д(h(x ∗ δ)) − д(h(x)) ≤ θ

4.4 Computing Optimal Parameters
Initialization. The environmental parameters are first initialized
(Figure 4 5○) using the VDS input. The background noise energy is
calculated by inspecting the ambient sound. Frequency shifting is
calculated by transmitting and decoding a nonce that covers the
working frequency range (500 - 8 kHz, sampled every 500 Hz). It is
assumed that the distance between the user and VDS input device
is set by the VDS device vendor.
Optimization. Computing the gradients of the optimization pa-
rameters directly using gradient-based methods is inefficient [25].
This is because the VDS’s acoustic environment is dynamic (e.g., due
to occlusions and varying background noise levels). In addition, the
formulated optimization is a multi-dimensional problem with con-
siderations of both reliability and imperceptibility. Hence, we use
differential evolution (DE) [31, 51] which is a gradient-free method.
DE generates diverse candidate solutions in each iteration which
avoids local minima and aids in convergence to a global minima. It
does not require apriori knowledge of the underlying acoustic en-
coding method or acoustic environment. Algorithm 1 summarizes
the use of DE for obtaining optimal parameters. The initial set of
candidate parameters P includes feasible frequency f , amplitude α,
and bitrate τ, estimated using RIR simulation. Once AEOLUS is de-
ployed, the initialization module first estimates the environmental
parameters, e.g., N0 and d. Subsequently, the optimization module

uses the pre-calculated RIR parameters for efficient convergence to
optimal parameters (see Section 5.1).
BER and SPL Calculation. The BER is calculated by compar-
ing the generated nonce that is embedded over-the-air and the
decoded nonce from the captured speech. With synchronization
techniques [41] used in the nonce embedding and detection, AEOLUS
is able to calculate how many error bits are received. For example,
if bit sequence "0010" is transmitted and "0110" is received, BER is
25%. SPL is calculated using Equation 2. AEOLUS first calculates the
frequency and amplitude of the captured speech. These parame-
ters along with other constant values (e.g., density of transmission
medium) are fed into Equation 2 to obtain SPL. In Algorithm 1, BER
threshold of 10−9 is used because it is a commonly used threshold
for a good BER in communication systems. Similarly, threshold
value of 5% is used for determining small SPL difference.
Candidate Comparison. A candidate’s parameter set is compared
with its parent based on their performance, i.e., the resulting BER

and SPL. If both the BERC and SPLC of a candidate is better than
the parent’s BERpar ent and SPLpar ent , the candidate is added to
the feasible set and the parent is discarded. If not both of the BERC
or SPLC of a candidate outperform BERpar ent and SPLpar ent , the
candidate is discarded.
5 EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION
AEOLUS is implemented as a prototype in MATLAB and evaluated
in three different environments (see Figure 7): (i) a conference room
(approx. 5.5 m by 4 m) selected as a reference for a semi-public
indoor environment, (ii) a campus dining area (approx. 25m by
50m) chosen to mimic a noisy indoor public area, and (iii) inside a
car parked at a gas station to simulate the use case of voice-driven
payments at gas stations [2]. For (i) and (ii), a FIFINE K669B mi-
crophone is used to record speech, and a Logitech S120 Speaker
System is used as playback device to simulate users. The evaluation
is performed at different distances (0.5-4 m) between the micro-
phone and playback device. For (iii), the microphone is identical
but the car’s in-built loudspeakers are used instead of the Logitech
loudspeakers. Also, the evaluation is performed at two different
distances 0.5 and 0.7 m.
AEOLUS is evaluated both on speech data captured from live par-
ticipants in ReMASC dataset [35] and synthesized speech from
Amazon Polly. A total of ten different speaker profiles are used
(four of which are synthesized). For each profile, three different
speech samples are used. Microsoft Azure’s speech and speaker
recognition services [9] are used for speech-to-text and speaker
recognition. Text-independent speaker verification service [8] is
used for speaker verification experiments. Each speaker’s profile is
first enrolled using a speech sample longer than 20 seconds. Ver-
ification is performed using the speaker’s speech samples with
and without acoustic nonce, and yields one of the following out-
puts: acceptance with “high”, “normal”, or “low” confidence, or a
rejection.
5.1 Performance
Optimal Parameters. First, we estimate optimal parameters for
achieving reliability and imperceptibility simultaneously in a given
environment using Algorithm 1. The frequency step size is set to
200 Hz and θ is set as 0.1 to ensure that the generated nonce is below
the average human speech SPL of 60 db. It is observed that lower
amplitudes and frequencies and higher bitrates are comparatively
optimal for acoustic nonce embedding in low noise environments,
e.g., conference room (see Table 1). Relatively higher amplitudes and
frequencies, and lower bitrates are more optimal in environments
with higher noise, such as the dining hall. This is because the
background noise in such environments typically vests as a low
amplitude low frequency noise.
Computational Overhead. Algorithm 1 iteratively optimizes the
parameter set P for the given environment. For conference room,
a single iteration is sufficient. However, for dining hall and gas
station environments, a few iterations (< 10) are required and the
computation takes a few seconds. This does not cause a delay at
the time of user interaction because it overlaps with the time a
user typically takes to set up a VDS. The acoustic nonce embedding
and decoding process occurs while user is interacting with VDS.
The computational overhead is negligible because the nonce size
is small, and the playback device is used only when the user is
speaking.
Reliability Next, we measure the reliability of embedding and
retrieving acoustic nonce in the three environments. For this, we
compute the average BER over 5 independent trials at different
distances between the VDS input device (microphone) and user.
Figure 8 shows that in all three environments, the average BER
upto a distance of 1.5 m is 0%. Note, however that BER increases
significantly beyond 1.5m in dining hall because the environment
is relatively noisy.
Speech Re-use Detection. In this experiment, we measure the
efficacy of AEOLUS in detecting speech re-use (see Table 2). The
input speech is considered re-used if (i) the current nonce is not
decoded correctly, and (ii) if any trace of an obsolete nonce is
detected. FRR indicates the proportion of falsely rejected samples
because of incorrect nonce decoding or because the detected nonce
is obsolete. FAR indicates how many re-used speech samples with
obsolete nonces are falsely accepted. AEOLUS achieves 0.5% FRR at
0% FAR for speech re-use prevention upto a distance of 4 meters in
the three environments.
5.2 Robustness
Impact on Speaker and Speech Recognition. The goal of this
experiment is to assess the impact of acoustic nonce embedding and
decoding on the performance of a commercial speaker and speech
recognition system (Microsoft Azure). The results show that there
is limited impact on the performance of the speaker recognition
system for the conference room and dining hall environments upto
a distance of 1.5 m (see Figure 9). The embedded nonce marginally
increases the average word error rate (WER) of the speech recog-
nition system to 4.4%. The WER is close to the reported average
WER of 5.1% for the same system in the NIST 2000 Switchboard
test set [60]. Manually reviewing the results indicates that most
errors are related to incorrect suffix “-ing”. A few errors are due to
small word omissions such as “an” and “a”. Relatively more errors
occur in the dining hall environment due to the background noise.
Acoustic Nonce Removal. An adversary may attempt to remove
the embedded acoustic nonce and obtain a “clean” speech sample to
conduct re-use attacks. To test the robustness of AEOLUS in this ad-
versarial setting, we use the following 6 common audio watermark
removal techniques [59]:
• Resampling. Samples the audio at a different frequency (e.g. 44.1
• Amplitude Compression. Alters the amplitude of recorded audio
• Filtering. Uses a high pass or low pass filter to remove a specific
range of frequency in the audio. For example, separate audible
signals from inaudible frequencies (e.g. ultrasound).
• Lossy Compression. Leverages data encoding methods that uses
inexact approximations and partial data discarding to compress
the audio. For example, MP3 [10] or MPEG-1 Audio Layer III re-
duce audio file size by taking advantage of a perceptual limitation
of human hearing.
