Abstract: Aggregating related information, from different data sources, allows the creation of data repositories with
very useful information. In the tourism domain, aggregating tourism products with related tourism
attractions will add value to those products. The ability to create dynamic packages is another reason to
aggregate tourism information. Defining an ontology, composed by the concepts to aggregate, is the first
step to create tourism aggregation systems. In this paper we define the approach and the architecture that
guides to the creation of aggregated solutions that provide valued tourism information and that allow the
creation of dynamic packages.
