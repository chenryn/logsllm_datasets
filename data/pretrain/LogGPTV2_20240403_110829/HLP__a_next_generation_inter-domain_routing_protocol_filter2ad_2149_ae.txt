### 6.2 HLP Software Router Implementation

HLP has been implemented as a module that integrates with the eXtensible Open Router Platform (XORP) software router [2]. The current implementation supports all the features of the basic HLP design, including various policy extensions such as exceptions and backup links.

#### 6.2.1 Overhead Characteristics

Two of the most common operations in an HLP router are the processing of LSA (Link-State Advertisement) updates and FPV (Forwarding Path Vector) updates. Tables 4 and 5 illustrate the LSA processing time and FPV throughput achieved by our implementation. These measurements were conducted on a 2.4 GHz Intel processor with 1 GB of memory. Although our implementation has not been optimized for performance, these results indicate that a straightforward implementation can handle today's BGP workload.

- **LSA Processing Time**: The complexity of LSA processing is due to the recomputation of shortest paths to destinations. Our numbers align with those reported in prior OSPF studies [26, 4]. In practice, the number of LSAs within a given second is expected to be very small, as each event (e.g., link failure) is captured in a single LSA message. This is in contrast to BGP, which generates multiple updates for a single event. Additionally, the frequency of link-cost changes is anticipated to be low. For example, a stub network that continuously deaggregates prefixes propagates at most one update every 30 seconds [5].

- **FPV Processing Rate**: The FPV processing rate we can support for a hierarchy of size 20,000 is at least ten times greater than the maximum update rate observed in a BGP router today [1].

| Hierarchy Size | LSA Processing Time (sec) |
|----------------|---------------------------|
| 100            | 0.0052                    |
| 300            | 0.0153                    |
| 500            | 0.0252                    |
| 700            | 0.037                     |
| 1000           | 0.052                     |

**Table 4: AS Hierarchy Size vs. LSA Processing Time (sec)**

| Number of ASs | FPV Processing Rate (updates/sec) |
|---------------|----------------------------------|
| 1000          | 5270                             |
| 5000          | 3154                             |
| 10000         | 1989                             |
| 15000         | 1452                             |
| 20000         | 1132                             |

#### 6.2.2 Implementation Lessons

Building a full-fledged prototype of HLP provided valuable insights into the router-level behavior of HLP and how it differs from BGP. Three key aspects are noteworthy:

1. **Code Reusability**: The base code of HLP shares many similarities with BGP and reuses more than 90% of the XORP BGP implementation. This demonstrates the ease of implementing HLP using existing BGP code.
2. **Consistency Checks**: To make HLP work at the router level, we had to revisit the HLP design and define the necessary set of consistency checks required in iHLP.
3. **Exception Handling**: Careful handling of exceptions at the router level is essential to avoid inconsistencies between routers. For example, one router might choose a customer route while another does not. This requires a router to keep track of the exceptions in other routers and declare an exception only in the presence of consensus.

### Transition from BGP to HLP

One important lesson from the implementation is a simple transition plan from BGP to a simplified version of HLP, which merely changes the current operational practices of BGP. The idea is to set up a two-level hierarchy, separating transit networks and stub networks into different levels, and using only the transit-stub links as the set of published provider-customer links. Using BGP routing information, each AS can independently infer this two-level hierarchy with high accuracy [27, 9, 19].

In this hierarchy:
- Links between transit networks execute BGP (this models the FPV aspect of HLP).
- All transit networks are required to install filters to allow a stub network to originate route announcements but not act as transit networks.
- Stub networks can signal link costs using AS path prepending.

This simple deployment offers several benefits:
1. **Scalability and Isolation**: Since stub networks account for a majority of ASs and their growth rate is higher than that of transit networks, this separation provides improved scalability and isolation properties compared to BGP.
2. **Reduced Misconfigurations**: Many stub networks are largely unmanaged, and minimizing the knobs available to these networks reduces the possibility of misconfigurations.
3. **Stability**: Routes between transit networks are relatively stable [5], and this stability cannot be affected by stub ASs.

### 7. Related Work

We classify related work into two categories:

#### New Internet Architectures

Several new Internet architectures have been proposed to address pressing problems in Internet routing. For example, the Newarch project proposed NIRA [31], which advocates better end-host control over routing. In NIRA, an end-host can choose the sequence of providers its packets traverse. Another approach is feedback-based routing [32], which computes an approximate topology map of the Internet at the AS level based on measurement-based feedback from the network. While many such routing architectures exist outside the realm of BGP, our primary motivation is to find a protocol that retains the operational and economic model of BGP but alters the route propagation model to address BGP's deficiencies. The IRTF guidelines [15] provided a good starting point in our design.

#### Changes to the BGP Protocol

HLP aims to provide improved scalability, isolation, diagnosis support, convergence, and security. Several works have proposed incremental changes to BGP to achieve these goals. For instance, Afek et al. [3] propose grouping prefixes with similar behavior into policy atoms to reduce overhead. BGP-RCN [23] embeds BGP updates with the location where updates are triggered, improving convergence and diagnosis. BGP's poor convergence properties are well-documented [21], and certain combinations of BGP policies can lead to divergence [12]. Gao and Rexford [10] propose policy guidelines to ensure routing convergence. Secure-BGP [16] and Secure-origin BGP [25] aim to improve BGP security. Subramanian et al. [29] and Chu et al. [14] have proposed alternative mechanisms to enhance BGP security while alleviating some of the deployment hurdles of a PKI.

### 8. Conclusions

Designing an inter-domain routing protocol is a challenging task, partly due to the need for global scalability and the wide range of policies that must be supported. BGP, while flexible, suffers from poor scalability, fault isolation, and convergence properties. In designing HLP, we started from the observation that to outperform BGP, we needed to use information that BGP lacks. Provider-customer relationships, which are inherently non-private for routing, led us to the use of link-state style algorithms in sizable parts of the AS hierarchy. However, between these regions, link-state is not viable due to policy-privacy issues, necessitating a hybrid link-state/path-vector solution. Separating prefix-binding from topology discovery further reduces routing protocol overhead and allows for appropriate security solutions.

The resulting protocol has many desirable properties, including fast convergence, good fault isolation, lower routing table churn, and inherently better security and robustness. However, a protocol's good routing properties do not guarantee economic viability for ISPs. Evaluation is particularly challenging because no single person has a complete understanding of what an inter-domain policy routing protocol needs to do in reality. We have examined the basic properties of convergence, fault isolation, and scalability, as well as how well HLP addresses the tasks BGP is used for. Our current understanding is that HLP performs well in a wide range of deployment scenarios, but further exposure to a variety of ISPs and router vendors will provide a more comprehensive evaluation.

While HLP is not poised to replace BGP anytime soon, putting a stake in the ground can stimulate informed debate about the requirements and design of future inter-domain routing.
