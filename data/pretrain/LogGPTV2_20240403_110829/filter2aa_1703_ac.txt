### Mail Client Fingerprinting

Mail clients are often underestimated as potential attack vectors. Unfortunately, identifying a target's mail client can be challenging. In the corporate world, Message Delivery Notifications (MDNs) can be used to obtain a reply message that contains the name and version of the mail client in use. When MDNs are not available, auditors must rely on exploiting ambiguities within the MIME standard to display different content to each mail client. Below is an example of important headers from an MDN sent by an Outlook Express client:

```
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: multipart/report;
    report-type=disposition-notification;
    boundary="----=_NextPart_000_0002_01C7BA3D.0DA9ED40"
X-Mailer: Microsoft Outlook Express 6.00.2900.2869
X-MimeOLE: Produced By Microsoft MimeOLE V6.00.2900.2962
```

### Process Discovery

Automated business processes can create windows of opportunity for attackers. Many financial organizations use insecure file transfer methods, such as FTP, to share information. Although the attack window may only be open for a few minutes at a time, the perceived risk is low. For example, even if files are encrypted, the control channel in FTP is not. The difficulty in auditing a business process lies in determining when and how it is performed.

#### Traffic Monitoring with IP IDs

One of the features of the IPv4 protocol is the implementation of the IP ID field. Many operating systems increment this field by one for every packet sent by the host. This allows auditors to determine the number of packets sent within a given time frame and to perform attacks such as blind port scanning. Auditors can track traffic patterns over a long period by probing the target at regular intervals and recording changes in the received IP ID value. This type of monitoring can reveal business processes like file transfers, backup operations, and other bursts of activity caused by automated systems.

#### Usage Monitoring with MS FTP

The Microsoft FTP service allows anonymous users to execute the `SITE STATS` command, which returns a count for each unique command executed on the server since the service was started. An auditor can access the server and poll these stats over a long period to build a timeline of when certain operations are performed. For example, the `STOR` command stat is incremented when a file is uploaded, so watching for a jump in this stat can indicate the time of an automated upload. The following output from Microsoftâ€™s public FTP server demonstrates that out of over two billion login attempts, only 3035 `STOR` commands were issued:

#### Web Site Monitoring with HTTP

The HTTP 1.1 protocol supports a `Last-Modified` attribute. When a compliant HTTP server (such as Apache) receives a request for static content, it automatically returns the date at which the resource was last modified. This feature can be used to expose automated update times for corporate web sites.

### Information Exploitation

#### Introduction

The previous chapter focused on information discovery techniques. This chapter builds on those techniques by abusing documented features to compromise target systems.

#### External Networks

External networks are often the starting point for penetration tests. External hosts are typically well-secured, patched, firewalled, and filtered. The only targets available are intentionally exposed applications, VPN services, and temporary paths for client-initiated UDP sessions.

##### Attacking File Transfers

File transfers between internal and external hosts can be subject to attack, depending on the protocol and the firewall involved.

###### Attacking FTP Transfers

The FTP protocol uses ephemeral ports for data transfers, exposing an open data port on either the client or the server to a race condition. Depending on the FTP software, it may be possible to connect to the data port and receive the contents of a downloaded file or write the contents of an uploaded file. The `pasvagg.pl` script can be used to hijack FTP transfers when the server allows anonymous access, data ports are allocated sequentially, and the FTP server allows connections to the data ports from IP addresses other than the initiating client. Any FTP server that supports "FXP" mode is vulnerable to this attack.

###### Attacking NFS Transfers

The NFS protocol involves several independent RPC services, each of which is subject to interference when used over a NAT gateway. NFS services will accept a response from any source IP and port that contains valid data, even if that host has no relation to the address specified in the NFS connection parameters. This is to support multi-homed NFS servers, where RPC responses flow back from a different IP than the address the client connected to.

To accommodate NFS traffic over NAT, older versions of the Linux kernel and many modern NAT devices allow UDP responses to be sent back to the client from other IP addresses. This exposes the client RPC services to the Internet when the client establishes a connection from behind a NAT device. The challenge for an auditor is finding the ephemeral port used to relay the connection and then identifying the associated RPC service.

##### Attacking Mail Services

A typical mail system consists of one or more relay systems, antivirus/spam filters, the actual mail server, and the user's email client. In most penetration tests, the focus is on intermediate systems, but mail clients themselves can also be targeted. For example, on Mac OS X, if two email messages are received with the same attachment name, the newer message can overwrite the previous message's attachment if enough fields match. This can be used to replace a trusted attachment with a backdoor within the user's mailbox.

##### Attacking Web Servers

Web servers are the most visible targets on an external network, but many penetration testers overlook obvious vulnerabilities. A brute force of common file and directory names can expose administrative areas, backup files, and archives of the entire site. Sending internal host names in the HTTP Host header can provide access to internal sites and employee-only areas. Nearly all web servers have applications installed, and any unrecognized application should be acquired from the vendor and audited for flaws. Some load balancers have trouble with long-lived HTTP sessions and can leak data from other users under the right conditions.

##### Attacking DNS Servers

Over the past ten years, most DNS servers have been configured to reject zone transfers from unauthorized hosts. Instead of pulling the entire zone, the auditor must brute force possible domains and host names to determine their existence. Many DNS servers are misconfigured to allow reverse DNS lookups of private addresses, exposing the names and addresses of important servers on the internal network. As mentioned in the outbound DNS section, many DNS servers are still vulnerable to transaction ID prediction or race conditions, such as those created by the Birthday Attack. A successful attack can lead to the injection of false DNS records into the cache and a potential hijack of internal and external domains, depending on the network configuration.

##### Attacking Database Servers

Although database servers are rarely exposed to the external network, it is a good idea to perform a quick scan for common database services. Many business applications (e.g., Saleslogix) run in a two-tier mode that requires direct access to the database server. Keep in mind that some database servers, such as Informix, still contain publicly-known, unpatched vulnerabilities.

##### Authentication Relays

One of the most effective attacks on internal users from outside the network relies on authentication relays. Many organizations expose Microsoft IIS or Exchange servers to the Internet, allowing Windows domain authentication using the NTLM protocol. If the victim's firewall has not been configured to drop outbound connections on ports 139 and 445, it is possible to send a user an email or redirect them to a web page that will force their workstation to initiate an SMB connection to a host of your choice. The actual impact depends on the version of Windows on the workstation and, in some cases, the web browser or mail reader they use.

On Windows 2000 and earlier systems, the browser will automatically negotiate NTLM authentication with the remote SMB server, using the current username and password of the user. If the auditor provides a malicious SMB server that relays this authentication to an externally accessible IIS or Exchange server, they can obtain direct access to that user's account. On Windows XP and later systems, this technique is not always possible from an external network. The NTLM credentials used by SMB, HTTP, SMTP, POP3, and IMAP4 are usually interchangeable, provided you have a tool to perform the relay.

An alternative to relaying the authentication credentials is to capture and crack the password hash itself. Tools such as L0phtcrack (no longer available) and Cain and Abel can be used for this purpose. More information about the capture process can be found in Warlord's article in the Uninformed Journal.

##### Free Hardware

As a last resort, the auditor can travel to the target's office and hand out free USB keys (with autorun enabled) to anyone who will answer a short survey. Alternatively, they can snail-mail CD-ROMs containing trojans, wrapped into an autorun or application installer. Possible labels for the CD include "Free MP3s" and "Complimentary License." If the budget allows, the auditor can mail out portable handheld devices, such as the Nokia Internet Tablet or the Sharp Zaurus, containing a full suite of Linux-based backdoors.

Alternatively, the auditor can create a custom UPS power brick containing an embedded PC. The auditor would purchase a 350VA or higher battery backup with surge protection for Ethernet ports, remove the battery, splice a power strip into the main power adapter, insert the guts of a Linksys WRT54L, add a four-port Ethernet switch, and prepare to visit the target's office. Once inside, the auditor can make an excuse to be near the network devices (printers, fax machines, etc.) and install or swap out the rogue UPS. An example of this modification can be found in the referenced material.

### Internal Networks

The term "internal network" usually refers to the soft, squishy interior of most corporate networks, but it can also refer to a network provided to a specific victim via a rogue access point. Once internal network access is obtained, a wide range of new attacks become possible.

##### NetBIOS Names

The NetBIOS protocol is used by various applications to locate important hosts on the network. Some NetBIOS names are treated as special cases. For example, the NetBIOS name "WPAD" will automatically be used as an HTTP proxy server if it resolves. The name "ISASRV" is a special case for clients looking for an ISA Server Proxy. Third-party applications have similar preferences. The Computer Associates Licensing Client will look for a local host called "CALICENSE" to send authorization requests to.

##### DNS Servers

DNS servers on the internal network are often configured to allow unauthenticated updates. Even when a Microsoft DNS server is configured to reject DNS-based update requests, it is still possible to inject names into the local DNS zone by passing these names as the hostname of DHCP client requests (the `-h` option for the ISC `dhcpcd` client). These types of DNS attacks can allow an internal attacker to hijack all access to a critical system, impersonate servers, and stage new attacks against the affected clients.

##### WINS Servers

In addition to NetBIOS and DNS, Windows clients also support name lookups via the WINS protocol. Normally, the DHCP server is responsible for telling each client what server to send WINS requests to. However, through DNS, it is possible to manipulate these settings and redirect WINS requests to a malicious server.
