### Data Provenance and Targeting Methods

Facebook's audience creation interface allows advertisers to target users in three primary ways:

1. **Traditional Facebook Targeting:**
   - This method uses pre-defined targeting attributes based on demographic, interest, and behavior-based features that Facebook gathers.
   - Data sources include:
     - User activities on Facebook (e.g., profile information, liked pages).
     - User activities outside Facebook (e.g., browsing history, app installations).

2. **Data Broker Targeting:**
   - This method leverages externally sourced data from partners like Acxiom, Experian, DLX, and Epsilon.
   - Example attributes:
     - **Acxiom:**
       - **Charitable Donations**
       - **Financial/Spending Methods**
       - **Purchase Behavior/Store Types**
       - **Residential Profiles**
       - **Financial/Net Worth/Liquid Assets**
     - **DLX:**
       - **Automotive/New Vehicle Buyers (Near Market)/Style**

3. **Advertiser PII Targeting:**
   - This method involves directly providing a list of personally identifiable information (PII) corresponding to specific users.

### Country-Specific Variations

The list of pre-defined targeting attributes varies based on the country where the advertiser creates their Facebook account. To collect these attributes, we created test accounts in 10 different countries (U.S., U.K., France, Germany, Australia, South Korea, Brazil, Japan, Canada, and India) and directed traffic through proxies. In total, we collected 1,420 unique targeting attributes across these 10 countries.

### Metadata and Audience Reach

For each attribute, we gathered metadata provided by Facebook's advertiser interface, including:
- A short description of the attribute.
- The data provenance (i.e., whether the data comes from Facebook or one of its partners).

We also created an audience for each attribute and obtained the corresponding audience reach estimate, which indicates the number of users with that attribute.
