ﬁnd that the list varies based on the country of the advertiser’s
Facebook account.5 Therefore, we collect the list of targeting
attributes across 10 different countries (U.S., U.K., France,
Germany, Australia, South Korea, Brazil, Japan, Canada, and
India) by creating test accounts in each of these countries. We
direct our trafﬁc through proxies in order to create advertising
accounts in each of these countries. In total, we collect 1,420
unique targeting attributes across the 10 countries.
In addition, we collect the metadata that Facebook’s adver-
tiser interface provides for each predeﬁned attribute: a short
description of the attribute (e.g., for “Multicultural Afﬁnity”
we get the description “People who live in the United States
whose activity on Facebook aligns with Hispanic multicul-
tural afﬁnity”); and the data provenance of the attribute (i.e.,
whether the data comes from Facebook or one of its partners
such as Acxiom). For each attribute, we create an audience
of users with that attribute, and obtain the corresponding
audience reach estimate (of the number of users in that

the lens of where the targeting data comes from (i.e., the data
provenance). Advertisers can target users in three different
ways: (1) based on attributes computed by Facebook—we
call this approach traditional Facebook targeting; (2) based
on attributes that are externally sourced from data brokers
such as Acxiom and Experian (called partner categories by
Facebook)—we call this approach data broker targeting; and
(3) by directly providing a list of PII corresponding to users
—we call this approach advertiser PII targeting.
1) Traditional Facebook targeting: This type of targeting
is essentially the traditional way to target people, where
advertisers can deﬁne their audiences by choosing from a
predeﬁned list of targeting attributes. This targeting exploits
information about users’ demographic-, interest-, and behavior-
based features that Facebook gathers.
To aggregate information about its users, Facebook has
many potential sources of data: information about the activities
users perform on Facebook (e.g., the information they provide
in their proﬁles, the pages they like, etc), as well as information
Facebook collects about users’ activities outside Facebook
(e.g., which sites users browse,4 which Facebook applications
they install on their mobile devices, etc).
To more closely examine how advertisers are able to
target their ads, we collect the full list of predeﬁned targeting
attributes, which is hierarchically organized as a tree with
similar attributes grouped under common sub-categories. We
4Facebook can use cookies to track visits by users to any webpage that has
either a Facebook tracking pixel [24], or a Facebook like button [35], or uses
the Facebook login [39] feature.
5Note that the list of predeﬁned targeting attributes varies based on the
country where the advertiser creates his Facebook account, and not on the
location of users that are targeted.
