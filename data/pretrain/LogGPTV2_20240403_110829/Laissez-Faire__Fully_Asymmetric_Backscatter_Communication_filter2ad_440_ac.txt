Use IQ signals to 
detect edges.
How can we address this problem? Instead of looking at the signal edges in the time domain, we should look at the signal edges in in-phase and quadrature dimensions, as shown in red in the example.

How to deal with edge collisions?
So far, I’ve assumed that that signal edges DO NOT collide with each other, but edges can collide especially when there is a large number of tags. One approach is retransmissions, but in many cases, we ﬁnd that 
this may not be necessary.

Assuming that two tags have different signal edges e1 and e2. When the two signal edges collide, they add on top of each other. The addition of the two signal edges lead to nine clusters in the IQ dimension where 
each cluster encodes the state of both edges.

The nine clusters are separable if SNR is sufficient. For a colliding edge signal, we only need to classify which cluster it belongs to for decoding.

This approach will not work if there are more than two tags that collide since there are way too many clusters. In this case, we turn to retransmission.

After that, LF Backscatter assign edges to each tags and decode the data.
I have omitted several low-level details in this talk such as how to associate the edge streams to nodes, how to deal with unknown numbers of tags, unknown bitrates, clock drift, and edge detection errors using a 
viterbi decoder, and refer you to the paper for these details. 
Evaluation
๏ 16 UMass Moo Tags 
๏ USRP N210 + SBX Daughterboard
We implemented LF-Backscatter on a software deﬁned radio, USRP N210, and 16 UMass Moo tags. Each tag is able to transmit up to 1 Megabits per second. The front-end of the software deﬁned radio is a SBX 
daughterboard with a bandwidth of 40MHz. It uses two separated antennas for transmission and reception.

We can observe that LF-Backscatter has stable bits per Joule even when the number of tags increases. In contrast, the energy efficiency of TDMA and Buzz decreases when the number of tags increases because 
there is too much control message overhead for slot messages, repeated transmissions and dealing with collisions. At the same time, LF Backscatter can be 20x more energy-efficiency than TDMA/Buzz.
What does LF-Backscatter sacriﬁce? 
As with every protocol, LF-Backscatter sacriﬁces something to get the energy and bandwidth beneﬁts.

This graph shows the SNR vs Bit error rate of LF-Backscatter versus ASK.
The main downside to LF-Backscatter is that it primarily operates in ranges where SNR is high because those are the conditions under which edges are more robustly decoded. This ﬁgure shows the bit error rate of 
LF-Backscatter across different SNR scenarios. Our experimental results show that LF-Backscatter requires 4dB additional SNR to have the same performance as ASK. This means that the working range of LF-
Backscatter will be about 20% shorter than ASK.

But one major advantage of LF-backscatter is that it uses a subset of the hardware that is used by a standard passive RFID tag. In other word, it is quite straightforward to switch from using LF-backscatter when 
conditions are good to and ASK when the SNR is lower. This means that existing tags can, with no hardware modiﬁcation, use LF-backscatter.

To conclude, LF-Backscatter is a protocol that allows multiple tags to transmit at whatever bitrate they want. At the heart of our work is the energy-bandwidth tradeoff inherent in ultra low-power backscatter-
based devices. LF-Backscatter tries to get the best of both worlds by interleaving transmissions to obtain more throughput while allowing them individually to operate at a slow rate to reduce power consumption. 
The results are dramatically reduced power consumption and increased throughput under moderately high SNR conditions.
