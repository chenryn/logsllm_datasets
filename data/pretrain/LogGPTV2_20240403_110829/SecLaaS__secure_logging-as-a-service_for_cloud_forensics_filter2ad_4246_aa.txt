## Abstract
Cloud computing has emerged as a popular paradigm in recent years, but current cloud architectures often lack support for forensic investigations. Log analysis is crucial for digital forensics, yet collecting logs from the cloud is challenging due to its black-box nature and multi-tenant model. Researchers have proposed using log APIs or cloud management consoles to address these challenges, but there is no concrete solution that ensures both user privacy and log integrity. This paper introduces Secure-Logging-as-a-Service (SecLaaS), which securely stores virtual machine logs and provides access to forensic investigators while preserving user confidentiality. Additionally, SecLaaS maintains proofs of past logs, ensuring their integrity against tampering by dishonest investigators or cloud providers. We evaluate the feasibility of SecLaaS by implementing it for network access logs in OpenStack, a popular open-source cloud platform.

## 1. Introduction
Cloud computing offers scalable infrastructure, convenient pay-as-you-go services, and cost-effective computing. As a result, it has become a dominant computing paradigm, attracting both small and large enterprises. According to Khajeh-hossainei, organizations can save up to 37% by moving their IT infrastructure to Amazon's cloud [17]. Market Research Media predicts the cloud computing market will grow at a 30% compound annual growth rate, reaching $270 billion by 2020 [20]. Gartner Inc. forecasts that cloud computing will generate $148.8 billion in revenue by 2014 [12]. INPUT reports that the federal cloud market is expected to expand to $800 million by 2013 [15].

While cloud computing opens new opportunities, it also presents significant security challenges. Malicious individuals can exploit cloud resources to launch attacks or use the cloud to attack other systems. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) reports that the average size of digital forensic cases in the U.S. is growing by 35% annually, from 83GB in 2003 to 277GB in 2007 [11]. However, traditional forensic techniques are not suitable for the dynamic nature of cloud computing, leading to the development of cloud forensics.

Digital forensics in the cloud begins with acquiring digital evidence, such as virtual machine images, stored files, and logs. Collecting these, especially logs, is difficult because users and investigators have limited control over the cloud infrastructure. Currently, investigators must rely on cloud service providers (CSPs) to provide logs, often through subpoenas. However, there is no way to verify the validity of the provided logs, and adversaries can erase traces by terminating virtual machines.

To address these challenges, researchers have proposed using read-only APIs and cloud management planes [5, 10]. However, these solutions do not ensure user privacy or log integrity. In this paper, we introduce Secure-Logging-as-a-Service (SecLaaS), which securely exposes cloud logs to forensic investigators while preserving user confidentiality and log integrity.

### Contributions
1. A scheme to reveal cloud users' logs for forensic investigation while maintaining the confidentiality of the logs.
2. Proof of Past Log (PPL) – a tamper-evident mechanism to prevent manipulation of logs by CSPs or investigators.
3. Evaluation of the proposed scheme using OpenStack, an open-source cloud platform.

## 2. Background and Challenges
### 2.1 Digital Forensics
Digital forensics involves the preservation, collection, confirmation, identification, analysis, recording, and presentation of crime scene information. It is defined as a methodical series of techniques and procedures for gathering evidence from computing equipment and storage devices, ensuring it is admissible in court [30, 16, 18, 24].

### 2.2 Cloud Forensics
Cloud forensics applies digital forensics in a cloud computing environment. Ruan et al. define it as a subset of network forensics, with three dimensions: technical, organizational, and legal [25]. The procedures vary based on the cloud service and deployment model. For example, SaaS and PaaS offer limited control, while IaaS allows more control and logging mechanisms.

### 2.3 Motivation
Despite the benefits of cloud computing, security concerns remain a major barrier. A recent IDCI survey found that 74% of IT executives cite security as a primary reason for not migrating to the cloud [8]. High-profile attacks, such as the botnet attack on Amazon's cloud in 2009 [2], highlight these concerns. Adversaries can use the cloud to launch attacks and then erase traces, making forensic investigation challenging.

### 2.4 Challenges
Log analysis is crucial for digital forensics, but collecting logs in the cloud is complex. The reduced level of control and dependence on CSPs make it difficult to gather and validate logs. Logs may be decentralized across multiple servers, and CSPs may not always provide all necessary logs. Additionally, there is a risk of log tampering by CSPs or investigators.

## 3. Adversary Capabilities and Possible Attacks
Adversaries can exploit the cloud to launch attacks and then erase traces, making it difficult for investigators to collect valid logs. CSPs may collude with attackers or tamper with logs, further complicating the forensic process.

## 4. SecLaaS Scheme
SecLaaS securely stores and provides access to virtual machine logs for forensic investigators. It uses a tamper-evident mechanism, Proof of Past Log (PPL), to ensure the integrity of the logs. This section details the design and implementation of SecLaaS.

## 5. Security Analysis
This section analyzes the security of the SecLaaS scheme, focusing on confidentiality, integrity, and the effectiveness of the PPL mechanism.

## 6. Implementation and Performance Evaluation
We evaluate the feasibility of SecLaaS by implementing it for network access logs in OpenStack. This section presents the implementation details and performance results.

## 7. Usability Discussion
This section discusses the usability of the SecLaaS scheme, including its ease of integration into existing cloud environments and the impact on system performance.

## 8. Related Work
This section reviews related research on logging in cloud forensics and compares it with the SecLaaS approach.

## 9. Conclusion
In conclusion, SecLaaS addresses the challenges of secure log collection and verification in cloud forensics. It ensures the confidentiality and integrity of logs, providing a robust solution for forensic investigations in the cloud.
