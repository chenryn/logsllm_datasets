ABSTRACT
Cloud computing has emerged as a popular computing paradigm
in recent years. However, today’s cloud computing architectures
often lack support for computer forensic investigations. Analyzing
various logs (e.g., process logs, network logs) plays a vital role in
computer forensics. Unfortunately, collecting logs from a cloud is
very hard given the black-box nature of clouds and the multi-tenant
cloud models, where many users share the same processing and
network resources. Researchers have proposed using log API or
cloud management console to mitigate the challenges of collecting
logs from cloud infrastructure. However, there has been no concrete
work, which shows how to provide cloud logs to investigator while
preserving users’ privacy and integrity of the logs. In this paper,
we introduce Secure-Logging-as-a-Service (SecLaaS), which stores
virtual machines’ logs and provides access to forensic investigators
ensuring the conﬁdentiality of the cloud users. Additionally, SeclaaS
preserves proofs of past log and thus protects the integrity of the
logs from dishonest investigators or cloud providers. Finally, we
evaluate the feasibility of the scheme by implementing SecLaaS for
network access logs in OpenStack – a popular open source cloud
platform.

INTRODUCTION
Cloud computing offers inﬁnite infrastructure resources, very
convenient pay-as-you-go service, and low cost computing. As
a result, cloud computing has become one of the most dominant
computing paradigms in recent years. Today, small and high level
companies are attracted to cloud computing because it does not
require any kind of local infrastructure setup, and, at the same
time, it is highly cost effective. According to Khajeh-hossainei,
an organization can save 37% of its cost just by moving their IT
infrastructure from an outsourced data center to Amazon’s cloud
[17]. Market Research Media stated in one of their recent reports
that the cloud computing market is expected to grow at a 30%
compound annual growth rate and will reach $270 billion in 2020
[20]. Garner Inc. states that the strong growth of cloud computing
will bring $148.8 billion revenue by 2014 [12]. From the research
work of INPUT, it is clear that Cloud computing is equally popular
in both Government and private industry; their report identiﬁes that
the federal cloud market is expected to expand to $800 million by
2013 [15].
Cloud computing opens a new horizon of computing for business
and IT organizations. However, at the same time, malicious indi-
viduals can easily exploit the power of cloud computing. Attackers
can attack applications running inside the cloud. Alternatively, they
can launch attacks from machines inside the cloud. These issues
are the primary concerns of Cloud Forensics. An annual report of
the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) states that, the size of the
average digital forensic case is growing 35% per year in the United
States. From 2003 to 2007, it increased from 83GB to 277 GB
[11]. As a result, forensic experts are devising new techniques for
digital forensics. There are several forensics analysis schemes and
tools available in market. Unfortunately, none of them are suitable
for the dynamic nature of cloud computing. Many of the implicit
assumptions made in regular forensics analysis (e.g., physical access
to hardware) are not valid for cloud computing. Hence, for cloud
infrastructure, a special branch of digital forensics has been brought
up by researchers - Cloud Forensics. Cloud forensics offers new
challenges and has opened new research problems for security and
forensics experts, which are important from both technical and legal
point of view.
The process of digital forensics starts with acquiring the digital
evidence. In a cloud, the evidence could be the image of virtual
machines, ﬁles stored in cloud storage, and logs provided by cloud
service providers (CSP). However, collecting these evidences, spe-
cially logs from cloud infrastructure, is extremely difﬁcult because
cloud users or investigators have very little control over the infras-
tructure. Currently, to collect logs from cloud, investigators are
dependent on the CSP. Investigators need to issue a subpoena to the
CSP to acquire the logs of a particular user. However, they need
to believe the CSPs blindly, as there is no way to verify whether
the CSPs are providing valid logs or not. Moreover, if an adversary
shuts down the virtual machine (VM) she is using, there is no way
to collect logs from the terminated VM.
To overcome the challenges of acquiring logs from cloud infras-
tructure, Bark et al. proposed that the CSPs can provide network,
process, and access logs to customers by a read-only API [5]. Dyk-
stra et al. recommended a cloud management plane for using in
Infrastructure-as-a-Service model [10]. However, they did not show
how we can practically implement those schemes. Additionally,
log information is highly sensitive and user’s privacy issues are
directly related to it. Previous studies do not provide a secure way
of revealing the logs while maintaining user privacy. Moreover, it is
vital to ensure that logs are not tampered with before exposing to
investigators. For a successful forensic scheme based on logs, these
issues must be resolved in a secure and trustworthy manner.
In this paper, we take the ﬁrst step towards exposing a publicly
available secure log service. This service can be used by forensic
investigators to identify malicious activities that took place in virtual
machines of a cloud system.
To illustrate the speciﬁc problem we look at, we present the
following hypothetical scenario:
Alice is a successful businesswoman who runs a shopping website
in cloud. The site serves a number of customers every day and
her organization generates a signiﬁcant amount of proﬁt from it.
Therefore, if the site is down even for a few minutes, it will seriously
hamper not only their proﬁt but also the goodwill. Mallory, a
malicious attacker decided to attack Alice’s shopping website. She
rented some machines in cloud and launched a Distributed Denial
of Service (DDoS) attack to the shopping website using those rented
machines. As a result, the site was down for an hour, which had
quite negative impact on Alice’s business. Consequently, Alice asked
a forensic investigator to investigate the case. The investigator
found that Alice’s website records the visiting customer’s IP address.
Analyzing the visiting customers records, the investigator found that
Alice’s website was ﬂooded by some IP addresses which are owned
by a cloud service provider. Eventually, the investigator issued a
subpoena to the corresponding cloud provider to provide him the
network logs for those particular IP addresses. On the other hand,
Mallory managed to collude with the cloud provider after the attack.
Therefore, while providing the logs to the investigator, the cloud
provider supplied tampered log to the investigator, who had no
way to verify the correctness of the logs. Under this circumstance,
Mallory will remain undetected. Even if the cloud provider was
honest, Mallory could terminate her rented machines and left no
traces of the attack. Hence, the cloud provider could not give any
useful logs to the investigator.
To mitigate the challenges discussed in the above scenario, we
propose the notion of Secure-Logging-as-a-Service (SecLaaS) in
this paper.
Contributions: The contributions of this paper are as follows:
1. We propose a scheme of revealing cloud users’ logs for foren-
sics investigation while preserving the conﬁdentiality of users’
logs from malicious cloud employee or external entity;
2. We introduce Proof of Past Log (PPL) – a tamper evident
scheme to prevent the cloud service provider or investigators
from manipulating the logs after-the-fact.
3. We evaluate the proposed scheme using a open source cloud
computing platform.
Organization: The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Sec-
tion 2 provides some background information and challenges of
cloud forensics in terms of logging. Section 3 describes the ad-
versary’s capabilities and possible attacks on logging-as-a-service.
Section 4 presents our SecLaaS scheme and Section 5 provides
security analysis of the scheme. In Section 6, we provide the imple-
mentation and performance evaluation of our scheme on an open
source cloud software, OpenStack. Section 7 discusses the usability
of our proposed schemes. In Section 8, we provide an overview of
related research about logging in cloud forensics, and ﬁnally, we
conclude in Section 9.
2. BACKGROUND AND CHALLENGES
With the increasing popularity of cloud computing, there is a
signiﬁcant interest in the law-enforcement community to extend
digital forensics techniques in the context of a cloud. In this section,
we present the deﬁnitions of digital forensics and cloud forensics,
motivation behind our work, and discuss the challenges of logging-
as-a-service for cloud forensics.
2.1 Digital Forensics
Digital forensics is the process of preserving, collecting, conﬁrm-
ing, identifying, analyzing, recording, and presenting crime scene
information. Wolfe deﬁnes digital forensics as “A methodical series
of techniques and procedures for gathering evidence, from comput-
ing equipment and various storage devices and digital media, that
can be presented in a court of law in a coherent and meaningful
format" [30]. According to a deﬁnition by NIST [16], computer
forensics is an applied science to identify an incident, collection,
examination, and analysis of evidence data. While doing so, main-
taining the integrity of the information and strict chain of custody
for the data is mandatory. Several other researchers deﬁne com-
puter forensics as the procedure of examining computer system to
determine potential legal evidence [18, 24].
2.2 Cloud Forensics
Cloud forensics can be deﬁned as applying computer forensics
procedures in a cloud computing environment. As cloud computing
is based on extensive network access, and as network forensics
handles forensic investigation in private and public network, Ruan
et al. deﬁned cloud forensics as a subset of network forensics [25].
They also identiﬁed three dimensions in cloud forensics – technical,
organizational, and legal. Cloud forensics procedures will vary
according to the service and deployment model of cloud computing.
For Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) and Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS),
we have very limited control over process or network monitoring.
Whereas, we can gain more control in Infrastructure-as-a-Service
(IaaS) and can deploy some forensic friendly logging mechanism.
The ﬁrst three steps of computer forensics, identiﬁcation, collection,
and organization of evidence will vary for different service and
deployment model. For example, the evidence collection procedure
of SaaS and IaaS will not be same. For SaaS, we solely depend on
the CSP to get the application log, while in IaaS, we can acquire
the virtual machine image from the customer and can enter into
examination and analysis phase. On the other hand, in the private
deployment model, we have physical access to the digital evidence,
but we merely can get physical access to public deployment model.
2.3 Motivation
Though cloud computing offers numerous opportunities to differ-
ent level of consumers, many security issues of cloud environment
have not been resolved yet. According to a recent IDCI survey, 74%
of IT executives and CIO’s referred to security as the main reason to
prevent their migration to the cloud services model [8]. Some recent
and well-publicized attacks on cloud computing platform justify the
concern with security. For example, a botnet attack on Amazon’s
cloud infrastructure was reported in 2009 [2].
Besides attacking cloud infrastructure, adversaries can use the
cloud to launch attack on other systems. For example, an adversary
can rent hundreds of virtual machines to launch a Distributed Denial
of Service (DDoS) attack. After a successful attack, she can erase
all the traces of the attack by turning off the virtual machines. A
criminal can also keep her secret ﬁles (e.g., child pornography,
terrorist documents) in cloud storage and can destroy all her local
evidence to remain clean. When law enforcement investigates such
a suspect, the suspect can deny launching a DDoS attack. At present,
there is no way to claim that an adversary access a certain network
at a given time.
Researchers are working to protect the cloud environment from
different types of attacks. However, in case of an attack, we also
need to investigate the incident, i.e., we need to carry out a digital
forensic investigation in the cloud. Besides protecting the cloud,
we need to focus on this issue. Unfortunately, there has been little
research on adapting digital forensics for use in cloud environments.
In this paper, we address this problem, which has signiﬁcant real-
life implications in law enforcement investigating cybercrime and
terrorism.
2.4 Challenges
Analyzing logs from different processes plays a vital role in
digital forensic investigation. Process logs, network logs, and appli-
cation logs are really useful to identify a malicious user. However,
gathering this crucial information in cloud environment is not as
simple as it is in privately owned computer system, sometimes even
impossible. The inherent characteristics of cloud have made the
forensic log-analysis a nightmare for the forensic investigators. It is
very difﬁcult to collect and prove the validity of the logs to the court
authority. For example, how can an investigator collect network
logs of malicious VMs, which have been already terminated by the
attacker after launching a DDoS attack last month? We must ﬁnd
secure techniques for storing and providing logs to investigators,
which also need to be admissible in a court of law as valid evidence.
Many things can complicate the log collection process. A malicious
CSP can change the logs while providing the logs to investigators.
Clients may question the integrity of any such logs, claiming that the
forensic investigators or the prosecution and the CSP have colluded
to plant evidence in the cloud. The following reasons also make
the log collection and providing the proof of the logs challenging in
cloud.
Reduced Level of Control, and Dependence on the CSP: One of
the challenges of collecting logs securely from cloud is the users’ or
investigators’ reduced level of control over the cloud environment.
In traditional computer forensics, the investigators have full control
over the evidence (e.g., router logs, process logs, hard disk). Cur-
rently, to acquire the logs, we extensively depend on the CSPs. The
availability of the logs varies depending on the service model. Fig-
ure 1 shows the control of customers in different layers for the three
different service models – IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS. From the ﬁgure,
we can observe that cloud users have highest control in IaaS and
least control in SaaS. This physical inaccessibility of the evidence
and lack of control over the system make evidence acquisition a
challenging task in cloud forensics. In SaaS, customers do no get
any log of their system, unless the CSP provides the logs. In PaaS,
it is only possible to get the application log from the customers.
To get the network log, database log, or operating system log we
Figure 1: Customers’ control over different layers in different ser-
vice model
need to depend on the CSP. For example, Amazon does not provide
load balancer log to the customers [3]. In a recent research work,
Marty mentioned that he was unable to get MySql log data from
Amazon’s Relational Database Service [21]. In IaaS, customers do
not have the network or process logs. Several other problems come
along with the less control issue. For example, we need to depend
on the cloud service providers for evidence acquisition, which in
turn brings the honesty issue of the CSP’s employee, who is not
a certiﬁed forensic investigator. CSPs can always tamper the logs
as they have the full control over the generated logs. Additionally,
CSPs are not always obligated to provide all the necessary logs.
Decentralization.
In cloud infrastructure, log information is not
located at any single centralized log server; rather logs are decen-
tralized among several servers. Multiple users’ log information may
be co-located or spread across multiple servers. Moreover, there are
several layers and tiers in cloud architecture. Logs are generated
in each tier. For example, application, network, operating system,
