ABSTRACT
While non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) such as stay-at-
home, shelter-in-place, and school closures are considered the most
effective ways to limit the spread of infectious diseases, their use
is generally controversial given the political, ethical, and socioeco-
nomic issues they raise. Part of the challenge is the non-obvious
link between the level of compliance with such measures and their
effectiveness.
In this paper, we argue that users’ demand on networked services
can act as a proxy for the social distancing behavior of communities,
offering a new approach to evaluate these measures’ effectiveness.
We leverage the vantage point of one of the largest worldwide
CDNs together with publicly available datasets of mobile users’
behavior, to examine the relationship between changes in user
demand on the CDN and different interventions including stay-
at-home/shelter-in-place, mask mandates, and school closures. As
networked systems become integral parts of our everyday lives,
they can act as witnesses of our individual and collective actions.
Our study illustrates the potential value of this new role.

virus rapidly spread around the world, triggering a number of large-
scale interventions to control this, starting with the full lockdown
of Wuhan, China, where the virus was first reported [15]. Countries
around the world quickly followed with measures that range from
school closures to large-scale lock-downs [28].
In the US, the first confirmed case was reported on January 20,
2020, in Snohomish County, Washington State. By March 23rd,
every state had reported cases of the virus [21]. By early April
of 2020, several state, city, and county governments had started
to adopt similar social-distancing interventions, including shelter-
at-home and temporary closing of non-essential businesses and
schools, although with variable levels of enforcement [53].
Social distancing measures aim, through a variety of means,
to decrease or interrupt virus transmission by minimizing contact
between individuals or population groups [31]. Non-pharmaceutical
interventions such as these are considered the most effective way
to limit the spread of infectious diseases like COVID-19 [45, 60,
63]. Indeed, even when or if vaccines become globally available -
and only 32.7% of the world population has been vaccinated as of
September 2021 [40] - recent studies suggest this alone will not be
sufficient to end the pandemic [16].
Despite their benefits, the use of NPIs is generally contentious
given the political, ethical, and socioeconomic issues they raise [6].
Part of the challenge is the non-obvious link between the level of
compliance with such measures and their effectiveness [49, 68],
particularly when the severity of the illness associated with the
infection renders controlled-human infection studies controver-
sial [22].
We argue that users’ demand for networked services can serve as
a proxy for the social distancing behavior of communities, offering
a new approach to evaluate these measures’ effectiveness.
The Internet is the fastest growing and more transformative
technology of our times. In just over 50 years, Internet penetra-
tion has grown to surpass 60% of the globe, connecting nearly 5
billion people [34]. The networked systems we have built over it,
from search engines to social networks and content distribution
networks (CDNs), have become an integral part of our lives and
witnesses to our individual and community actions. Our work is
motivated by a simple observation – as people comply with social
distancing measures, one would expect to see a significant change
in networked systems’ demand as people attend to their education,
work, and entertainment remotely.
In this paper, we leverage the vantage point of one of the largest
worldwide CDNs to study the relationship between user demand
on networked systems, social distancing, school closures, and the

rate of COVID-19 cases, and to extend a prior study on the positive
impact of mask mandates.
We focus our study in several counties1 in the US, where the
highly variable mitigation response and its enforcement, and the
varying intensity of the outbreak, challenge the analysis of these
responses’ effectiveness.
We first use Google’s Community Mobility Reports (CMR) [32]
together with logs of resource demand on the CDN (CDN demand),
to characterize the relationship between user mobility across differ-
ent counties in the US and user demand on the CDN. Google CMR
provides the percentage change in activity at each of six location
categories (such as retail and recreation, workplaces, and residen-
tial) compared to that of a baseline days before the outbreak. We use
this to define a metric of mobility as a proxy for social distancing,
on the basis of the assumption that when individuals make fewer
trips, they physically interact less. This usage aligns with prior
work on epidemiology and public health (e.g., [2, 4, 11, 43, 59]). We
demonstrate that changes in CDN demand are positively correlated
with this metric. For 20 of the top US counties based on population
density and Internet penetration, the average distance correlation
is 0.54 (max = 0.74).
We then employ CDN demand to examine the relationship be-
tween social distancing and the growth rate of COVID-19 infections
in different counties in the US. Following Badr et al. [4], we focus
on the 25 counties with the highest number of reported cases by
April 2020. Our analysis shows that CDN demand is strongly corre-
lated with lower COVID-19 case growth rates for the most affected
counties in the US, with distance correlations over 0.65 for 20 out
of the 25 counties (avg. 0.71).
Some social distancing NPIs, such as shelter-at-home and closing
of non-essential businesses, result in changes to intra-region or
intra-county mobility which are well captured by the Google CMR
and its categories. University campus closures, another commonly
adopted NPI, should have a very different relationship to demand.
As campuses close and people relocate outside the region, one would
expect to see a correlated drop in CDN demand. To understand the
applicability of CDN demand as a proxy of social distancing for
interventions that result in inter-region mobility, we use university
campus closures in the 20 largest college towns in the US [29]. Our
analysis shows a strong correlation (0.71) between decreasing CDN
demand, as students move away from school, and the incidence
of COVID-19 cases in the respective counties, providing further
evidence of the effectiveness of this mitigation strategy.
Besides social distancing, one of the most popular if contentious
NPIs is mask-wearing [1, 47]. A key factor fueling the debate has
been the relatively limited direct evidence on how much widespread
community use would affect the spread of COVID-19 [30]. In the
HHS and CDC weekly report of November 27, 2020, Van Dyke et
al. [67] provided some of the needed evidence with a study compar-
ing trends in county-level incidence of COVID-19 in counties with
and without a mask mandate in the state of Kansas. Their analysis
shows that the increasing trends of infection reverse in mandated
counties, after the mandate became effective on July 3, 2020.
While the study provides evidence that mask-wearing decreases
the spread of COVID-19, the authors point to the absence of social
distancing information, a confounding factor, as one of the main
limitations of their work. We use CDN demand as a proxy of social
distancing to address this limitation, extending their study to ex-
plore the combined effects of social distancing and mask mandates.
Our analysis shows the clear benefits of the combined interventions.
The combination of mandated use of masks and increased social
distancing resulted in a clear decrease in COVID-19 incidence (inci-
dence case trend with a slope of -0.71) for these counties, compared
with counties with only mask mandates (slope of 0.05) and those
counties with neither mask mandates nor social distancing (slope
of 0.19).
Our findings are subject to several limitations (§8), including
the following. First, while we control for known confounding fac-
tors using natural experiment designs [8, 20, 23, 44], there may be
additional confounding factors for which we have not accounted.
Second, the data we rely on does not include sociodemographic
information and it might not representatively capture all groups,
such as low-income groups for whom Internet access may be hard
to afford. Despite this, the consistency of our findings with those
of prior work (e.g., [4, 67]) increases confidence in our approach.
Third, our analysis is limited to counties in the US and relies on the
perspective of a single CDN. The US presents an interesting and
challenging case study. The varied response to the pandemic across
the country, combined with different progression and intensity of
outbreaks, complicates the already challenging task of evaluating
the effectiveness of different NPIs [67]. In total, our study focuses
on 163 counties across 21 states. The CDN we rely on is one of the
largest in the world, operating more than 240,000 servers in over
1,700 networks, serving nearly 3 trillion HTTP requests daily. In
addition, our analysis is descriptive – looking at the association be-
tween mobility, CDN demand, and COVID-19 transmission across
different datasets from different sources. Deriving statistical models
that could be used for prediction is left as future work [4].
1.1 Contributions
This work makes the following contributions:
• We demonstrate the strong relationship between CDN de-
mand and user mobility as a proxy of social distancing (§4).
• Relying on CDN demand as a new proxy of social distancing,
we show the strong correlation between demand and the
growth rate of COVID-19 cases in a selected set of counties
in the US (§5).
• We investigate the effectiveness of school closures as an
NPI by exploring the relation between inter-region mobility,
CDN demand, and the incidence of COVID-19 infections
before and after university campus closures (§6).
• Finally, we extend prior work studying the effectiveness of
mask mandates by using CDN demand to show the combined
values of social distancing and mask-mandates (§7).
1A county in the US is an administrative or political subdivision of a state that consists
of a geographic region with specific boundaries and usually some level of governmental
authority [10].
1.2 Ethical Considerations
This work does not raise any ethical issues.

2 BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION
Non-pharmaceutical interventions have been proven effective in
reducing the spread of infectious diseases including COVID-19 [45,
60, 63]. NPIs such as physical distancing, school closures, stay-at-
home or shelter-at-home orders, travel restrictions, and the use of
masks in public spaces, have been put in place around the world to
reduce the transmission of the virus. As new and potentially more
infectious strains of the virus continue to appear, many countries
have reinstated these large-scale interventions or were considering
doing so by May 2021, well over a year after the beginning of the
pandemic [26, 39].
Even if vaccines were to become widely available, there is a
growing consensus that these social distancing interventions as
well as the mandated use of masks should remain in place [5]. While
multiple effective COVID-19 vaccines have been under production,
vaccination varies widely around the world with only 2% of the
population in low-income countries having received at least one
vaccine dose compared with about two-thirds (65%) in high-income
countries as of September 2021 [49, 51, 57]. As the virus continues to
circulate in these countries, new variants will emerge, threatening
the world and slowing global economic recovery.
Social distancing, while generally considered one of the most
effective public health measures to limit the spread of infectious
diseases, remain controversial partially due to the non-obvious link
between the level of compliance with these measures and their
effectiveness [6]. Webster et al. [68] argues that adherence to these
measures is mainly influenced by the knowledge people had about
the disease and the measure itself, social norms, perceived benefits
of the intervention, and perceived risk of the disease, among other
factors. These measures are effective if adherence to them results
in large-scale behavioral changes that reduce the close contacts
and mobility patterns that facilitate the spread of the disease, but
quantifying these effects, particularly on the spatial, temporal, and
population scales to inform public health responses, is challeng-
ing [33, 43].
Prior work [4, 15, 42, 54] has proposed the use of mobility as cap-
tured by anonymized mobile user data to generate social distancing
metrics and relies on this, together with epidemiological data, to
evaluate how social distancing affects the rate of new infections.
The use of mobile phone data for evaluating COVID-19 responses
has raised issues with the potential sources and implications of
selection bias in mobile phone data [33]. The aggregated view of
networked system demand offers a promising alternative.
Our work is motivated by a simple observation – as people com-
ply with social distancing measures, one would expect to see a
significant change in networked systems’ demand as parents and
children work, study, and entertain themselves remotely. We ex-
plore the potential use of CDN demand as a proxy of social distanc-
ing, offering an alternative approach to evaluating the effectiveness
of certain NPIs, and rely on natural experiment designs to control
for known confounding factors [8, 18, 20, 44].
3 DATASETS
In this section, we describe the three main datasets we rely on for
this study: COVID-19 infection data from the Johns Hopkins Univer-
sity CSSE real-time dashboard [21], mobility data from Google Com-
munity Mobility Reports [32], and aggregated data on requests is-
sued or demand for resources hosted by a CDN. Additional datasets
are described as part of later sections.
3.1 JHU CSSE Dashboard
Since January 22, 2020, the Center for Systems Science and En-
gineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University has been hosting
an interactive web-based dashboard and associated GitHub reposi-
tory with the location and number of confirmed COVID-19 cases,
deaths, and recoveries for all affected countries. The dashboard
reports cases at the province level in China, county level in the
US, state level in Australia and Canada, and at the country level
otherwise.
Initially, the data was provided by DXY, an online platform run
by members of the Chinese medical community, and as the diseases
spread around the world, the data sources have correspondingly
expanded to include 10 aggregated data sources and nearly 200 at
the country, region level and, for the US, at the state or county/city
level, including county and state health departments and multiple
national government health departments.
We gathered the data for all counties in the US from the CSSE
COVID-19 repository [41] for our analysis. Throughout the paper,
we use different months of 2020 for different parts of the study, as
needed to address the question at hand. For the analysis on demand
and infection cases (§5) we use April and May 2020, for the study
on mask mandates that extends Van Dyke et al. [67] (§7) we use
June and July 2020, and for the analysis of campus closures (§6) we
use data for November 2020.
3.2 Google Community Mobility Reports
Also in response to the COVID-19 outbreak, Google started to
release aggregated data collated from users accessing their appli-
cations from mobile and handheld devices who allow recording
of ‘location history’. These Community Mobility Reports (CMR)
show changes in activity and mobility at different location types,
compared to before the spread of COVID-19 [32].
To generate the reports, individual user presence and time spent
at specific location categories are collated to indicate activity. The
data is categorized into six discrete classes, which can be sum-
marized as retail and recreation, parks, groceries and pharmacies,
workplaces, transport transit hubs and residential areas. CMR pro-
vides the percentage change in activity at each location category
compared to that on baseline days before the outbreak (January 3,
2020, to February 6, 2020). Baseline day figures are calculated for
each day of the week for each country and are calculated as the
