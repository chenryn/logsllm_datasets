## Abstract
Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) such as stay-at-home orders, shelter-in-place mandates, and school closures are considered the most effective ways to limit the spread of infectious diseases. However, their use is often controversial due to political, ethical, and socioeconomic issues. One of the key challenges is the non-obvious link between compliance with these measures and their effectiveness.

In this paper, we argue that user demand on networked services can serve as a proxy for social distancing behavior, offering a new approach to evaluate the effectiveness of NPIs. We leverage data from one of the largest worldwide content delivery networks (CDNs) and publicly available datasets of mobile users' behavior to examine the relationship between changes in CDN demand and various NPIs, including stay-at-home/shelter-in-place orders, mask mandates, and school closures. As networked systems become integral parts of our daily lives, they can act as witnesses to our individual and collective actions. Our study illustrates the potential value of this new role.

## 1 Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has dramatically altered daily life. Starting in early 2020, the virus rapidly spread around the world, prompting large-scale interventions, such as the full lockdown of Wuhan, China, where the virus was first reported [15]. Countries worldwide quickly followed with measures ranging from school closures to large-scale lockdowns [28].

In the United States, the first confirmed case was reported on January 20, 2020, in Snohomish County, Washington State. By March 23rd, every state had reported cases of the virus [21]. By early April 2020, several state, city, and county governments had adopted social-distancing interventions, including shelter-at-home orders and temporary closures of non-essential businesses and schools, though enforcement varied [53].

Social distancing measures aim to decrease or interrupt virus transmission by minimizing contact between individuals or population groups [31]. NPIs are considered the most effective way to limit the spread of infectious diseases like COVID-19 [45, 60, 63]. Even if vaccines become globally available, recent studies suggest that vaccination alone will not be sufficient to end the pandemic [16].

Despite their benefits, NPIs are contentious due to the political, ethical, and socioeconomic issues they raise [6]. A key challenge is the non-obvious link between the level of compliance with these measures and their effectiveness [49, 68], particularly when controlled human infection studies are controversial [22].

We argue that user demand for networked services can serve as a proxy for social distancing behavior, offering a new approach to evaluate the effectiveness of these measures.

The Internet is the fastest-growing and most transformative technology of our time. In just over 50 years, Internet penetration has grown to surpass 60% of the global population, connecting nearly 5 billion people [34]. Networked systems, such as search engines, social networks, and CDNs, have become integral parts of our lives and witnesses to our individual and community actions. Our work is motivated by the observation that as people comply with social distancing measures, there should be a significant change in networked system demand as they attend to education, work, and entertainment remotely.

In this paper, we leverage the vantage point of one of the largest worldwide CDNs to study the relationship between user demand on networked systems, social distancing, school closures, and the rate of COVID-19 cases, and to extend prior studies on the positive impact of mask mandates.

We focus our study on several counties in the US, where the highly variable mitigation response and its enforcement, along with the varying intensity of the outbreak, challenge the analysis of these responses' effectiveness.

### 1.1 Contributions
This work makes the following contributions:
- We demonstrate the strong relationship between CDN demand and user mobility as a proxy for social distancing (§4).
- Using CDN demand as a new proxy for social distancing, we show the strong correlation between demand and the growth rate of COVID-19 cases in a selected set of US counties (§5).
- We investigate the effectiveness of school closures as an NPI by exploring the relationship between inter-region mobility, CDN demand, and the incidence of COVID-19 infections before and after university campus closures (§6).
- Finally, we extend prior work studying the effectiveness of mask mandates by using CDN demand to show the combined value of social distancing and mask mandates (§7).

### 1.2 Ethical Considerations
This work does not raise any ethical issues.

## 2 Background and Motivation
NPIs have been proven effective in reducing the spread of infectious diseases, including COVID-19 [45, 60, 63]. Measures such as physical distancing, school closures, stay-at-home orders, travel restrictions, and the use of masks in public spaces have been implemented globally to reduce virus transmission. As new, potentially more infectious strains continue to emerge, many countries have reinstated these large-scale interventions or are considering doing so [26, 39].

Even if vaccines become widely available, there is a growing consensus that social distancing and mask mandates should remain in place [5]. While multiple effective COVID-19 vaccines are under production, vaccination rates vary widely, with only 2% of the population in low-income countries having received at least one dose compared to about two-thirds (65%) in high-income countries as of September 2021 [49, 51, 57]. As the virus continues to circulate, new variants threaten global health and economic recovery.

Social distancing, while generally considered one of the most effective public health measures, remains controversial due to the non-obvious link between compliance and effectiveness [6]. Webster et al. [68] argue that adherence to these measures is influenced by factors such as knowledge about the disease, social norms, perceived benefits, and perceived risk. These measures are effective if they result in large-scale behavioral changes that reduce close contacts and mobility patterns, but quantifying these effects is challenging [33, 43].

Prior work [4, 15, 42, 54] has proposed using mobility data captured by anonymized mobile user data to generate social distancing metrics and evaluate their impact on the rate of new infections. However, the use of mobile phone data raises concerns about selection bias [33]. The aggregated view of networked system demand offers a promising alternative.

Our work is motivated by the observation that as people comply with social distancing measures, there should be a significant change in networked system demand. We explore the potential use of CDN demand as a proxy for social distancing, offering an alternative approach to evaluating the effectiveness of certain NPIs, and rely on natural experiment designs to control for known confounding factors [8, 18, 20, 44].

## 3 Datasets
In this section, we describe the three main datasets used in this study: COVID-19 infection data from the Johns Hopkins University CSSE real-time dashboard [21], mobility data from Google Community Mobility Reports [32], and aggregated data on requests issued or demand for resources hosted by a CDN. Additional datasets are described in later sections.

### 3.1 JHU CSSE Dashboard
Since January 22, 2020, the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University has been hosting an interactive web-based dashboard and associated GitHub repository with the location and number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries for all affected countries. The dashboard reports cases at the province level in China, county level in the US, state level in Australia and Canada, and at the country level otherwise.

Initially, the data was provided by DXY, an online platform run by members of the Chinese medical community. As the disease spread, data sources expanded to include 10 aggregated data sources and nearly 200 at the country, region, and, for the US, at the state or county/city level, including county and state health departments and multiple national government health departments.

We gathered the data for all US counties from the CSSE COVID-19 repository [41] for our analysis. Different months of 2020 were used for different parts of the study: April and May 2020 for the analysis on demand and infection cases (§5), June and July 2020 for the study on mask mandates (§7), and November 2020 for the analysis of campus closures (§6).

### 3.2 Google Community Mobility Reports
In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, Google started releasing aggregated data collated from users accessing their applications from mobile and handheld devices who allow recording of 'location history'. These Community Mobility Reports (CMR) show changes in activity and mobility at different location types compared to before the spread of COVID-19 [32].

To generate the reports, individual user presence and time spent at specific location categories are collated to indicate activity. The data is categorized into six classes: retail and recreation, parks, groceries and pharmacies, workplaces, transit hubs, and residential areas. CMR provides the percentage change in activity at each location category compared to baseline days before the outbreak (January 3, 2020, to February 6, 2020). Baseline day figures are calculated for each day of the week for each country and are used to normalize the data.
