## Describe the bug
Trying Next with layout pattern:
https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/canary/examples/layout-component
And the problem is that Layout component get remounted on every page change. I
need to use layout component as a Container so it'll fetch data from server on
every mount. How can I prevent layout to get re-mounted? Or am I missing
something there?
## To Reproduce
  1. Download https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/canary/examples/layout-component
  2. Add following code to Layout component:
    React.useEffect(() => {
        console.log("layount mounted " + new Date());
      }, []);
  3. See how Layout get remounted on every page, even though it's not supposed to.
## System information
MacOS  
Chrome  
Next.js latest
## Additional context
I've found a workaround in this article:

So maybe it's a feature request partly.
