## Abstract
Cross-Datacenter Region (DR) Wide Area Networks (WANs) are essential for providing timely data and analytics to users across various geographical locations. Data duplication synchronization among different Internet Datacenters (IDCs) is crucial for reliability and performance. However, this process faces significant challenges due to limited bandwidth and time-sensitive transmission requirements. In this work, we introduce PieBridge, a cross-DR data duplication platform designed to handle large-scale data transmissions, such as hundreds of terabytes generated from online applications. We deployed PieBridge on Baidu's IDCs and achieved promising performance results compared to existing approaches.

## 1. Introduction
Large information platform providers, such as Microsoft, Google, and Baidu, offer timely data services to users in various geographical locations. To support these services, multiple IDCs are built. For instance, Baidu, the largest Chinese search engine, has a distributed network of IDCs (Figure 1). Timely data duplication across these geographically distributed IDCs is challenging due to:

1. **High Data Volume:** Services may have hundreds of millions of users, generating several terabytes of data daily. This data must be synchronized across IDCs through links with limited bandwidth, which also carry cross-traffic from other applications.
2. **Time Sensitivity:** Data transmission completion times must be short to ensure that users can access the data promptly.

In this work, we present PieBridge, a centralized data transmission platform for WAN-scale networks. PieBridge schedules data transmission among IDCs, enhances system upload, maximizes total data traffic, and reduces data transmission completion time.

### 2.1 Scheduling Algorithm
PieBridge's scheduling algorithm consists of three main procedures in each data transmission period:

1. **Subtask Selection:** When a transmission task arrives, it is split into subtasks and queued.
2. **Max-Traffic Scheduling:** The algorithm maximizes the total weighted bandwidth allocation using the residual network, which tracks the remaining capacity. It applies the path augmentation algorithm [1] and adds the selected subtask's data to the chosen path. This process repeats until no more augmenting paths are available.
3. **Subtask Merging:** At the end of a scheduling period, subtasks with the same source/destination are merged to reduce the calculation cost in the next period.

### 2.2 System Design
The architecture of PieBridge (Figure 2) includes two main components:

1. **Logically Centralized Controller:** Accepts tasks from users and makes scheduling decisions. It consists of a scheduler and an agent-monitor. The scheduler executes the scheduling algorithm, and the agent-monitor facilitates communication with agents.
2. **Agents:** Implement tasks at each node, control data transmission, and report processing status to the agent-monitor. They set upload/download rate limits, maintain local status information, and manage tasks.

When a user request arrives, the controller performs admission control, the scheduler makes scheduling decisions, and the agent-monitor informs the involved agents. Upon receiving an assignment, an agent executes the scheduled data transmission.

## 3. Evaluation
We implemented and evaluated PieBridge on Baidu's real WAN topology and data traffic matrices using the Go language. For a 30 TB data duplication stored in source IDCs, there were 12 clusters, each downloading one data copy. Each cluster typically had 1,000 servers. We compared PieBridge's completion time with the popular P2P approach (Figure 3a). PieBridge completed the transmission three times faster than P2P and eliminated the long tail phenomenon. Figure 3b shows the utilization of upload links for the source server and two destination servers in different DRs, demonstrating that PieBridge significantly outperforms P2P.

## 4. Conclusion
WAN-scale large data transmission is essential for service reliability and cost control. We designed, implemented, and deployed PieBridge at Baidu, achieving promising results. PieBridge maximizes communication link bandwidth utilization and significantly reduces data synchronization completion time.
