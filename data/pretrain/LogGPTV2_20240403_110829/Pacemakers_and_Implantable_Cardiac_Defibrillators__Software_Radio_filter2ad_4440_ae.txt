Key management. This paper does not address the well-
known problem of key management. Using a shared secret
(called Km above) is reasonable for a prototype implemen-
tation, but a large-scale deployment of shared key material
— in implanted devices, hospitals, clinics, ambulances, IMD
programmers, and so on — may pose an unacceptable risk
because of the ease with which an unauthorized party could de-
crypt transmissions upon obtaining the key material. (Though
our recommendation of storing Km in secure hardware does
partially mitigate this risk under certain threat models.) The
simple scheme described above also fails to address revocation
of privilege and is therefore ill-suited to situations in which
key material might be compromised, although the proposed
system is still no less secure than the open-access model of
conventional systems. An SKEYS [9] or key-regression [6]
approach, with periodic updates of programmer keys, might
mitigate the time-window in which an attacker can use com-
promised keys while also not signiﬁcantly changing the overall
model. Furthermore, the ofﬂine nature of the transactions that
must be secured — imagine an ambulance reaching an ICD
patient in a remote setting — further complicates the problem
of key management and revocation.
In the context of medical devices, security-related de-
sign choices must balance security, privacy, safety, and efﬁ-
cacy [10]. An ideal key management scheme for this context,
which we present as an important open problem, must provide
security and support privacy without hindering the operation
of medical devices that are already known to provide safe and
effective treatments.
C. Zero-Power Sensible Key Exchange
We now present a key-distribution technique that comple-
ments both of our previous defensive techniques: distribution
of a symmetric cryptographic key over a human-perceptible
sensory channel. The primary goal is to allow the patient to
detect a key exchange while it occurs.
Approach. The programmer initiates our protocol by supply-
ing an unmodulated RF carrier signal that could power the
passive component of the IMD. The IMD then generates a
random value to be used as a session key and broadcasts
it as a modulated sound wave. The amplitude of this sound
wave is such that it can be easily received and demodulated
by a reader with a microphone in contact with the patient’s
body near the implantation site, but it cannot be heard over
background noise at any appreciable distance from the patient,
at least not without dedicated sensing equipment. The close
proximity this enforces further ensures patient awareness and
consent to the authentication attempt. Once key exchange has
been performed, RF communication can safely occur over a
longer range without fear of eavesdropping.
Evaluation. We implemented our key exchange mechanism
on the WISP using as carrier frequency the same 4 kHz

Zero-power sensible key exchange: a nonce is transmitted
from the ICD to the programmer using acoustic waves. It can be clearly
picked up only if the programmer is in contact with the patient’s body
near the implantation site, and can be used as the secret key in the
authentication protocol from the previous section. (1 cm is a typical
implantation depth. Diagram is not to scale.)

audible and tactile signal discussed above. To effect key
exchange, we used the same modulation scheme currently
in use by our reader (2-FSK). We achieved a baud rate of
310 Bd, permitting transmission of a 128-bit nonce in 0.4 s.
The components performed key exchange without drawing
power from a battery, and the exchange was clearly audible,
measuring 75 dB SPL through a human hand. When the
microphone was not in contact with the skin, the sound pickup
was too low to be measured on our meter (< 60 dB SPL). In
our ad hoc experiments, transmission of the key was easy
to feel with the hand, but difﬁcult
to hear at a distance.
While these preliminary measurements show the plausibility
of making eavesdropping difﬁcult, further work is necessary to
illuminate the relationship between sound levels and the ability
to eavesdrop. Furthermore, an adversary may attempt to eaves-
drop on the electromagnetic emanations [14] of the electrical
components that generate the sound rather than on the sound
itself. Radio shielding in the form of a Faraday cage or use of
non-electromagnetic, optical links between security-sensitive
modules may help to reduce these unintended emanations. An
alternate approach for sensible key exchange might be for the
programmer to transmit the key to the IMD over an audio
channel, or for the ﬁnal key to be derived from keys sent in
both directions.
VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
Our investigation shows that an implantable cardioverter
deﬁbrillator (1) is potentially susceptible to malicious attacks
that violate the privacy of patient information and medical
telemetry, and (2) may experience malicious alteration to the
integrity of information or state, including patient data and
therapy settings for when and how shocks are administered.
Moreover, standard approaches for security and access control
may not always be suitable for IMDs due to tensions between
security (e.g., access for pre-authorized parties only) and safety
(e.g., access for previously unauthorized parties in emergency
circumstances) [10]. Our three new methods for zero-power
security (zero-power notiﬁcation, zero-power authentication,
and sensible key exchange) implemented on a prototype are
steps toward mitigating this tension without simultaneously
drawing power from a battery.
Reﬂections on existing and next-generation IMD technolo-
gies. Evaluating the security and privacy of an IMD best
leverages skills from many disciplines,
including security,
cryptography, cardiology, signal processing, radio communica-
tions, and antenna design. Next-generation IMDs, which may
incorporate greater communications capabilities and be more
networked, should not rely solely upon external mechanisms
like ﬁrewalls on external devices and controlled distribution of
commercial programmers. Firewalls on wireless programmers
or Internet-connected at-home monitors do not immediately
protect the wireless links themselves and may not protect the
integrity of communications. Controlled distribution of pro-
grammers cannot prevent insider access, and the availability
of software radios can make the possession of a commercial
wireless reprogrammer unnecessary. In essence, device man-
ufacturers should not view external devices, like commercial
programmers, as part of the trusted computing base for IMDs.
Additionally, the trend toward increasing nominal read range
allows ﬂexible home monitoring for better safety, but it also
increases the exposure of devices to attacks from nearby
adversaries. Finally, for economic and safety reasons, certain
IMDs typically contain non-rechargeable batteries and require
surgery for replacement. Conventional approaches for security
and privacy may facilitate trivial denial of service attacks
against these batteries.
Future directions and open problems. Critical systems that
rely on computing devices are already designed with great
care. When these systems include wireless computing devices,
additional precautions are necessary to ensure that the comput-
ing devices appropriately balance safety with convenience and
do not introduce unacceptable risks. Medical device design is
one such situation. Our research into implantable cardioverter
deﬁbrillators has demonstrated failure modes that do not
appear to be addressed by some present-day design strategies

Our work therefore leaves open a number of research
problems. While there are a few obvious minor next steps,
our research calls for much broader and innovative action. In
concert with Halperin et al. [10], this work illuminates the
need for a principled and deeper investigation into prevention
mechanisms, detection mechanisms, audit mechanisms, deter-
rents, and methods that enhance patient awareness and ensure
consent. Moreover, a fundamental challenge will be to develop
methods that appropriately balance security and privacy with
traditional goals such as safety and effectiveness. Our work
provides a foundation for these explorations, on top of which
we hope to see much subsequent innovation. Such innovations
will become more crucial as the technologies and capabilities
of implantable medical devices continue to evolve.
