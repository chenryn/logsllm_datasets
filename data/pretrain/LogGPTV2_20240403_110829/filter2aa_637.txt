Motivation
• Satellite hacking talks never deliver 
• RF world largely neglected by hacker community 
• So much legacy tech in critical systems 
• Spark interest in satellite security research
What are we going to learn?
• Overview of basic RF signals and modulation 
• What is spread spectrum - how does it work and 
how do we work with it 
• Picking a target and reverse engineering it 
• Exploiting that target 
• Next steps
Analog RF Modulation
• Amplitude Modulation (AM) 
• Frequency Modulation (FM)
Digital RF Modulation
• Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK / OOK) 
• Frequency Shift Keying (FSK) 
• Phase Shift Keying (PSK)
Spread Spectrum 
Modulation
• What is Spread Spectrum Special?  WiFi, Bluetooth, 
Most modern RF Communication
Spread Spectrum 
Modulation
• Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS) 
• Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS)
Selecting a Target
• Consumer Accessible 
• Cheap 
• Popular 
• High Impact
Introducing SPOT
• SPOT 
• But wait… this tech is used… everywhere.  
Goldmine.
Who uses it?
• Flight Planning Services 
• Consumers 
• SCADA 
• Big Gas and Oil
How does it work?
• LEO non-geosynchronous Bend Pipe Architecture
Intel Gathering
• Google 
• FCC Database 
• Academic Papers 
• Integrator Spec Sheets
Intel Gathering Continued
• What we know: 
• PN = 255 Chip M-Sequence 
• 1.6xx ghz 
• 144 bit message
Hardware and Validation
• USRP B200 
• GQRX 
• GNURADIO
Decoding Theory
• Mix signal with PN sequence and the BPSK signal 
will drop out
Packet Format Contd.
• Wait a second… There is no signing… No 
encryption. 
• We can create packets if we known how to 
reproduce the checksum. 
• Reverse engineering the checksum
Transmitting
• Strictly Theoretical - Do not attempt 
• This is the easy part
Impact of Transmission
• Spoof communications 
• Disrupt critical services
Signal Interception Demo
• DEMO
Future Research
• Code optimization 
• Custom hardware 
• Widespread reception
Slides and Code
• Updated slides, resources, and code to be posted 
online after the presentation.
