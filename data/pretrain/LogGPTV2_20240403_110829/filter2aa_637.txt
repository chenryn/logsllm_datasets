# Spread Spectrum Satcom Hacking: Attacking the Globalstar Simplex Data Service

**Presenter:** Colby Moore  
**Contact:** @colbymoore - PI:EMAIL

## Motivation
- Satellite hacking talks often fail to deliver practical insights.
- The RF (Radio Frequency) world is largely neglected by the hacker community.
- Many critical systems still rely on legacy technology.
- The goal is to spark interest in satellite security research.

## What Will We Learn?
- Overview of basic RF signals and modulation techniques.
- Understanding spread spectrum: how it works and how to work with it.
- Selecting a target and reverse engineering it.
- Exploiting the target.
- Next steps for further research.

### Analog RF Modulation
- **Amplitude Modulation (AM)**
- **Frequency Modulation (FM)**

### Digital RF Modulation
- **Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK / OOK)**
- **Frequency Shift Keying (FSK)**
- **Phase Shift Keying (PSK)**

### Spread Spectrum Modulation
- **What Makes Spread Spectrum Special?**
  - Used in WiFi, Bluetooth, and most modern RF communication systems.
- **Types of Spread Spectrum Modulation:**
  - **Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS)**
  - **Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS)**

## Selecting a Target
- **Criteria:**
  - Consumer-accessible
  - Affordable
  - Popular
  - High-impact

### Introducing SPOT
- **SPOT Technology:**
  - Widely used in various applications.
  - A goldmine for potential vulnerabilities.

### Who Uses It?
- Flight planning services
- Consumers
- SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) systems
- Oil and gas industries

### How Does It Work?
- LEO (Low Earth Orbit) non-geosynchronous bend pipe architecture

## Intelligence Gathering
- **Sources:**
  - Google
  - FCC Database
  - Academic papers
  - Integrator spec sheets

### Intelligence Gathering Continued
- **Key Information:**
  - PN (Pseudo-random Noise) sequence = 255 Chip M-Sequence
  - Frequency = 1.6xx GHz
  - Message length = 144 bits

## Hardware and Validation
- **Tools:**
  - USRP B200
  - GQRX
  - GNURADIO

### Decoding Theory
- **Process:**
  - Mix the signal with the PN sequence to extract the BPSK (Binary Phase Shift Keying) signal.

### Packet Format
- **Observations:**
  - No signing or encryption.
  - Packets can be created if the checksum can be reproduced.
  - Reverse engineering the checksum is necessary.

## Transmitting
- **Note:**
  - This is a theoretical discussion. Do not attempt to transmit without proper authorization.
  - The actual transmission process is relatively straightforward.

### Impact of Transmission
- **Potential Consequences:**
  - Spoof communications
  - Disruption of critical services

## Signal Interception Demo
- **Demo:**
  - Live demonstration of signal interception.

## Future Research
- **Areas of Focus:**
  - Code optimization
  - Custom hardware development
  - Widespread reception and analysis

## Slides and Code
- **Availability:**
  - Updated slides, resources, and code will be posted online after the presentation.
