The WorldWide WarDrive:
The Myths, The Misconceptions, The Truth, The Future
Chris Hurley aka Roamer
History
•I was talking with The Watcher on the Netstumbler 
Forums and found out we live relatively close to each 
other. 
•We thought it would be fun to try to coordinate a 
WarDrive to cover the entire city of Baltimore and 
started a thread on the Netstumbler Forums to see if 
there was any interest. 
•Renderman decided to do a coordinated drive in his 
area. 
•Blackwave and Mentat had discussed a similar idea in 
the past.
History
•I posted the idea on the DefCon Forums to see if 
there was any more interest.  There was. 
•That coordinated drive of Baltimore quickly 
evolved into the WorldWide WarDrive.

The Myths
Myths are the false impressions about the 
WorldWide WarDrive and WarDriving in general 
that have been thrust upon the general public by 
the media and the uninformed (not mutually 
exclusive).
The myth that the WorldWide WarDrive is a 
covert organization run by shady individuals out 
to provide terrorists with information has been 
propagated by several different media 
organizations.
Myth 1
“The group that runs the www.worldwidewardrive.org Web site leaves its own identity 
secret but does offer numerous links to other like-minded organizations as well as giving 
a somewhat cryptic e-mail address, PI:EMAIL, for those interested 
in organizing their own local efforts. 
Wardrive appears to be an offshoot of warchalking, another tactic intended to disclose 
unsecured wireless networks.”

Evidence of Myth 1
Myth 1 exposed
Using a handle or online identity is “an act of hiding your identity”
This is just not true.  The for profit issue is even addressed in the 
WWWD FAQ:
"Can I hire you to secure my access point for me?
No"
There appears to be no description of the WWWD members
A link from a for profit security company is on the WWWD site.
Many individuals use an online name or handle.  My real name is 
all over the WWWD site.
There are no “members” of the WWWD.  The individual 
organizers’ sites often have information about themselves. 
The WWWD FAQ also specifically addresses warchalking:
"Do you "WarChalk" the APs you find?
No. I think WarChalking is stupid."
WarDriving is an “offshoot” of warchalking.
WWWD participants “warchalk” the access points discovered 
during the worldwide wardrive
Neither I nor anyone I know has actually 
SEEN a chalked AP.
Certainly one was "derived" from the other. He just had it 
backwards.
Myth 1 exposed concluded
There is a prevalent myth that the Information 
Security Industry has a hard time locking down 
access points and securing wireless networks
Myth 2
War driving bedevils security types partly because it is so cheap and easy to 
do. Drivers amble around with a directional antenna sometimes fashioned 
from a coffee or potato-chip can. Their software of choice, called 
NetStumbler, comes free on the Web and detects the low-level radio waves 
coming out of wireless-network access points.

Saturday by William M. Bulkeley
http://www.msnbc.com/news/824622.asp?cp1=1
Evidence of Myth 2 and Myth 2 exposed
The media has also pushed the myth that the 
WWWD is an attempt to provide people with 
information on how to get free internet access.
Myth 3
People with knowledge of the location of an unprotected wireless network can also use 
it for free Web surfing, to send out e-mail messages or spam anonymously.
Evidence of Myth 3 and Myth 3 
exposed
Participants make chalk marks on sidewalks or building fronts to signal the 
availability of access points. 
Knowing such locations permits people with laptops to avoid paying for Internet 
access.
Anyone who wants to access a network without authorization isn’t going 
to look to online sources to find access points.  
It would be faster to just find one outside.
This has already been exposed as a myth.  This just doesn’t happen
WARCHALKING IS A MYTH!!
The Biggest Myth of All
The Misconceptions
Misconceptions are the false impressions that 
those within the hacking community, the 
security industry, and some Law Enforcement 
Organizations have about the WorldWide 
WarDrive and WarDriving in general.
A common misconception is that the WWWD is an attempt 
to propagate FUD and scare Security Professionals and 
Network Administrators
Misconception 1
According to an article that ran at net-security.org IT managers should 
be wary of Aug 31st (Kickoff of first WWWD)
IT managers have no reason to fear the WWWD.  Our goals 
clearly state that we make no attempt to access ANY networks.
“Hackers armed with laptops” are looking for unprotected networks
We are making a statistical analysis of ALL access points, not just 
the “unprotected” networks
Evidence of Misconception 1 and
the record set straight
Some within the hacking and wireless 
communities have the misconception that the 
WWWD is a marketing tool to sell products or 
services.
Misconception 2
The WWWD data is being used to:
1)
Contact people for the purpose of selling their services 
2)
Show to potential customers to point out how "insecure“ everyone is 
3)
The WWWD did not respond to these accusations when confronted with 
them.
1) We sell nothing. Period. We provide FREE information on the site
on how to "secure" their APs.
2) See point 1. We have no customers nor do we have any potential 
customers.
3) I was given only 36 hours from the time these accusations were mailed to me
until this email was sent to the kismet list.
Evidence of Misconception 2 and 
the record set straight
There is a misconception that during the 
WWWD wireless networks are more likely to 
be attacked/compromised.
Misconception 3
This one was prevalent from the start of the first 
WWWD.  SANS was probably my favorite 
offender here.
From SANS NewsBites, 11 September 2002:
--9 September 2002 Wardriving Reveals Lack of LAN Security A 
week-long worldwide wardrive revealed that many wireless LANs 
(local area networks) don't employ even basic security. A New 
Jersey-based company is selling complete wardriving kits. A 
consultant for the company observed that wardriving is legal and 
has legitimate uses. 
[Editor's Note (Murray): it is legal to look in your neighbor's open 
window but nice people do not do it. There is no more corrupting 
idea than the current one that that which is legal is, ipso facto, 
ethical.] 
Evidence of Misconception 3 and
the record set straight
The Canadian Security Intelligence Service was 
very concerned about the first WorldWide 
WarDrive.
Misconception 4
======================================
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
======================================
Hackers and geeks worldwide will be inaugurating the first international wardriving day, 
Saturday August 31st, 2002.
"Wardriving" is a cousin of "war dialing," a term popularized in the 1983 movie "War Games.". 
War dialing used software to dial many phone numbers automatically, looking for tones which 
indicated a modem. Wardriving, also known as "net stumbling," is a new variant, focused on 
discovering wireless computer networks.
This is a "high-tech" hobby, where participants armed with laptops, wireless networking gear, 
global positioning units and vehicles compete to find as many "wireless" networks in their 
regions as possible. There are literally tens of thousands of wireless networks operating 
throughout the world. 
Hundreds have already been mapped in Calgary and Edmonton, let alone other communities 
throughout Alberta.
While there are no prizes, no rules and definitely no glamour, this activity is constructive in that 
it raises awareness with regards to: privacy, security (or alternatively a complete lack of 
security), and the growing number of wireless networks sending information over, around and 
through an area.
On Saturday, August 31st, participants will depart from Edmonton and Calgary converging on 
Red Deer, Alberta. At which point, we will plan a wardriving route, which we will then use to 
map Red Deer upon departure.
Meeting time & location: 
10 AM
White Spot
6701 - 50th Avenue, Red Deer, AB
We would be pleased to include media representatives for participation as passengers, or 
competitors. We can provide transportation or setup instructions as appropriate. Space is 
obviously limited, so contact us ASAP.Canadian Press Release
“3.  A computer enthusiast from Edmonton issues a press release on 21 August 
2002, stating that he was arranging a war-driving exercise in Red Deer, 
Alberta, on 31 August 2003 as a component of the internationally scheduled 
event…”
“4.  Wireless technology makes it easier for“ attackers “to search for data and 
invade the privacy of networks users since computer networks have no 
physical boundaries.”
Text from Canadian Security 
Intelligence Service report
Luckily, the CSIS ended up educating themselves.  It was quickly 
discovered that the WWWD had no untoward intentions
The Truth
The WorldWide WarDrive is an effort by security 
professionals and hobbyists to generate awareness 
of the need by individual users and companies to 
secure their access points. The goal of the 
WorldWide WarDrive (or WWWD) is to provide a
statistical analysis of the many access points that 
are currently deployed. 
We feel that many end users are not aware that the 
factory or "default" settings on Access Points do not 
take any security measures into account. By 
providing these statistics we hope that end users 
will become aware of the need to take simple 
measures to secure their access points.
The First WorldWide WarDrive
The First WorldWide WarDrive took place 
between 31 August and 7 September 2002.  
Approximately 100 people participated in 22 
areas.  6 Countries and 2 Continents were 
represented.

Conclusion..aka The Future
WWWD Stat generator will be released by the 
Church of WiFi.
WWWD will be an annual event.  
Data upload/stat generation will be an automated 
(and instant) process.
