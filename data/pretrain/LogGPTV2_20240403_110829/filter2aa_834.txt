### The WorldWide WarDrive: Myths, Misconceptions, Truths, and the Future

**By Chris Hurley (aka Roamer)**

#### History

- **Initial Idea**: The concept of a coordinated WarDrive to cover the entire city of Baltimore was born from a conversation between me and The Watcher on the Netstumbler Forums. We discovered we lived relatively close to each other and thought it would be an interesting project.
- **Community Interest**: A thread was started on the Netstumbler Forums to gauge interest, and Renderman decided to coordinate a similar drive in his area. Blackwave and Mentat had also discussed a similar idea in the past.
- **Expansion**: I posted the idea on the DefCon Forums, which generated additional interest. This led to the evolution of the Baltimore WarDrive into the WorldWide WarDrive.

#### Myths

**Myth 1: The WorldWide WarDrive is a covert organization run by shady individuals.**

- **Source**: Ephraim Schwartz, "Wardrive attempts to find unsecured wireless networks," InfoWorld.
- **Evidence**:
  - The use of online handles or aliases does not imply hiding one's identity; it is a common practice in the tech community.
  - The WWWD FAQ explicitly states that they do not provide for-profit services.
  - There are no "members" of the WWWD, and individual organizers often provide personal information on their sites.
  - The WWWD FAQ also addresses warchalking, stating, "No. I think WarChalking is stupid."

**Myth 2: WarDriving is cheap and easy, using makeshift antennas and free software.**

- **Source**: William M. Bulkeley, "Hackers target wireless networks Worldwide 'war drive' set for Saturday," MSNBC.
- **Evidence**:
  - While WarDriving can be done with basic equipment, it is not necessarily cheap or easy. The focus is on raising awareness about security, not on the cost or ease of the activity.

**Myth 3: The WWWD provides information on how to get free internet access.**

- **Source**: Various media reports.
- **Evidence**:
  - The primary goal of the WWWD is to raise awareness about the security of wireless networks, not to provide unauthorized access.
  - Warchalking, the practice of marking locations of open networks, is a myth and not a common practice among WWWD participants.

#### Misconceptions

**Misconception 1: The WWWD aims to propagate FUD and scare IT professionals.**

- **Source**: An article on net-security.org.
- **Evidence**:
  - The WWWD clearly states that they make no attempt to access any networks. Their goal is to conduct a statistical analysis of all access points, not just unprotected ones.

**Misconception 2: The WWWD is a marketing tool to sell products or services.**

- **Source**: Various accusations within the hacking and wireless communities.
- **Evidence**:
  - The WWWD provides free information on securing access points and does not sell any products or services.
  - Accusations were addressed promptly, but the WWWD has no commercial interests.

**Misconception 3: During the WWWD, wireless networks are more likely to be attacked or compromised.**

- **Source**: SANS NewsBites, 11 September 2002.
- **Evidence**:
  - The WWWD does not engage in or encourage attacks on wireless networks. The event is purely for data collection and awareness.

**Misconception 4: The WWWD has untoward intentions.**

- **Source**: Canadian Security Intelligence Service report.
- **Evidence**:
  - The CSIS later educated themselves and found that the WWWD had no malicious intentions.

#### The Truth

The WorldWide WarDrive is an initiative by security professionals and hobbyists to raise awareness about the need for users and companies to secure their wireless access points. The goal is to provide a statistical analysis of deployed access points, highlighting the importance of taking simple security measures.

#### The First WorldWide WarDrive (August 31 – September 7, 2002)

- **Participants**: Approximately 100 people in 22 areas across 6 countries and 2 continents.
- **Statistics**:
  - Total APs Found: 9,374
  - WEP Enabled: 2,825 (30.13%)
  - No WEP Enabled: 6,549 (69.86%)
  - Default SSID: 2,768 (29.53%)
  - Default SSID and No WEP: 2,497 (26.64%)

#### The Second WorldWide WarDrive (October 26 – November 2, 2002)

- **Participants**: Approximately 200 people in 32 areas across 7 countries and 4 continents.
- **Statistics**:
  - Total APs Found: 24,958
  - WEP Enabled: 6,970 (27.92%)
  - No WEP Enabled: 17,988 (72.07%)
  - Default SSID: 8,802 (35.27%)
  - Default SSID and No WEP: 7,847 (31.44%)

#### The Third WorldWide WarDrive (June 28 – July 5, 2003)

- **Participants**: Approximately 300 people in 52 areas across 11 countries and 4 continents.
- **Statistics**:
  - Total APs Found: 88,122
  - WEP Enabled: 28,427 (32.26%)
  - No WEP Enabled: 59,695 (67.74%)
  - Default SSID: 24,525 (27.83%)
  - Default SSID and No WEP: 21,822 (24.76%)

#### Combined Results from All Three WorldWide WarDrives

- **Total APs Found**: 113,529
- **WEP Enabled**: 35,654 (31.41%)
- **No WEP Enabled**: 77,875 (68.59%)
- **Default SSID**: 32,938 (29.01%)
- **Default SSID and No WEP**: 29,276 (25.78%)

#### The Future

- **WWWD Stat Generator**: To be released by the Church of WiFi.
- **Annual Event**: The WWWD will continue as an annual event.
- **Data Upload and Stat Generation**: These processes will be automated and instantaneous.
