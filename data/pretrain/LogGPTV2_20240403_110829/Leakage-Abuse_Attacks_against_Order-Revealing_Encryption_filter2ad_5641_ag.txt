lower-frequency names, but the results suggest that some
lower-frequency names have higher recovery rates. This is
because of overlaps. For example, the names “james” and
“john” are lexicographically close, so ﬁxing the overlaps in
their intervals introduces dataset-dependent error. This is also
the reason why the recovery rates for some names go down
as we attack more names (e.g., “michael” with k = 10 vs.
k = 40 in the previous paragraph).
Attack variants. The attack’s use of conﬁdence intervals
allows the attacker to tune the precision/recall trade-off of the
attack. For example, if the attacker only cares about attacking
those people named “michael” but wants to be very sure only
“michael”s are attacked, it can lower the conﬁdence value d
above to make fewer guesses which have high precision. If it
wants to maximize recall, it can instead set the d value very
close to 1.
We leave exploring the trade-off between accuracy and the
conﬁdence value as an open problem. An interesting setting is
one in which the attacker has some model of the discrepancy
between its auxiliary data and the true plaintext distribution.
With this, an attacker could use different conﬁdence values
for different plaintexts.
The bigger picture. Stepping back, we should reﬂect on
the implication of these results for the security of any OPE
or ORE. Our results show that high-frequency elements
encrypted with OPE or ORE can be reliably recovered (with
probability many times better than the baseline) even if their
frequency is not leaked. This raises questions about the ﬁtness
of OPE and ORE for the highly non-uniform distributions
that arise in practice.
IX. RELATED WORK
Property-revealing encryption schemes. The study of en-
cryption schemes that reveal order was initiated by Agrawal
et al. [1], who constructed a scheme that preserved the order
property for numeric inputs, but lacked provable guarantees.
The ﬁrst study of OPE with reductionist security guarantees
was due to BCLO [5]. Their scheme’s window one-wayness
security was subsequently analyzed by Boldyreva, Chenette,
and O’Neill [6]. We use their analysis in our attacks against
the BCLO scheme, as discussed in Section V.
In [6], it was shown that any OPE scheme provably leaking
only frequency and order must have exponentially large
ciphertexts. Popa et al. [37] extended this negative result
to cover stateful, interactive schemes that have immutable
ciphertexts. They also introduced an interactive OPE scheme
with mutable ciphertexts that leaks at most order and fre-
quency information. Kerschbaum and Schr¨opfer propose a
more efﬁcient interactive OPE scheme [26]. Our attacks in
Section IV work against these schemes. Later, Kerschbaum
proposed a frequency-hiding, interactive OPE scheme [25],
our attack in Section VIII applies to this scheme.
ORE was introduced by Boneh et al. [7] with the hope of
providing better security while still allowing order compar-
ison. Their scheme relies on multilinear maps [18], making
them currently inefﬁcient [29] and potentially insecure given
doubt about the validity of cryptographic hardness assump-
tions related to multilinear maps [2, 21, 33]. Our attack in
Section VIII would affect these schemes. CLWW provide a
practical ORE scheme that also leaks frequency [12], our
attacks in Section VI affect this scheme, as well as their sug-
gestion of composing OPE with ORE. Lewi and Wu [30] de-
veloped a new ORE construction that leaks less than CLWW,
but does not achieve ideal leakage. Their construction is
elegant but is not yet practical due to large ciphertext sizes.
For security parameter λ ≈ 128 and plaintext domain of
size n, their ciphertexts require O(λn) space.
Schemes supporting range queries Recent schemes [16,
30,41] have been developed that only support range queries.
Lewi and Wu’s scheme [30] can be modiﬁed to support
only range queries. Their modiﬁed scheme has security sim-
ilar to the frequency-hiding scheme of Kerschbaum, and is
vulnerable to our attacks on that scheme. The scheme of
Roche et al. [41] is designed with the assumption that not
all values will be queried. This assumption allows them
to achieve stronger security at the cost of applicability to
most applications of ORE. Faber et al. [16] adapt the OXT
searchable encryption protocol of Cash et al. [11] to support
range queries by transforming them into disjunctive queries,
but at the cost of a very large increase in database size.

To enable range queries on a column containing M n-
bit values with security parameter λ ≈ 128, they require
size O(λMlog n). Their scheme does resist ofﬂine inference
attacks, but the large increase in space complexity greatly
diminishes its practical deployability. Since these are not
ORE schemes they are outside the scope of this work.
Systems using ORE/OPE. Several companies and ser-
vices advertise encryption that preserves functionality, in-
cluding CipherCloud and Skyhigh Networks [13, 22, 36, 43].
CryptDB [38,40] was the ﬁrst system in the academic litera-
ture that introduced a scheme for running a large subset of the
SQL language on the server side, given an encrypted database
(EDB). It used deterministic encryption and OPE, as well as
standard encryption. Since then, the popularity of EDBs has
increased. Many companies such as IQrypt [22] and SAP [42]
are producing their own CryptDB-inspired solutions. Some
more recent academic systems use OPE or ORE as well, such
as Seabed [35] and Minicrypt [48].
Attacks against property-revealing encryption. Inference
attacks were ﬁrst considered against searchable symmetric
encryption [14, 44] by Islam, Kuzu, and Kantarcioglu [23]
with subsequent improvements and investigation of active
attacks by Cash et al. [10] and Zhang et al. [47]. Grubbs
et al. [19] presented an active attack against the multi-user
searchable encryption scheme used in Mylar [39]. Naveed et
al. [34] were the ﬁrst to consider inference attacks against
CryptDB-style EDBs, as discussed in Section IV.
Concurrent work. In a concurrent and independent work,
Durak, DuBuisson, and Cash [15] show how the sorting
attack from NKW [34] can be extended to the multi-column
case, when two or more columns contain correlated data.
They demonstrate that multi-column attacks are more devas-
tating than separate attacks on individual columns. They also
show attacks on non-ideal OPE/ORE schemes that leak more
than the order and frequency of the ciphertexts, including the
BCLO scheme. Their primary focus is sparse datasets such
as GPS coordinates, and do not look at names, birthdates, or
ZIP codes as we consider in our running case study.
Durak et al. do not exploit auxiliary information, and
instead rely only on leakage, whereas our attacks show
how to both exploit leakage by itself and to augment an
auxiliary-information-using inference attack. Their attacks
therefore only provide approximate recovery of plaintexts
(e.g., determining that a plaintext lies within some 10km
radius), whereas our attacks recover entire plaintexts, and in
many cases fully recover most records in a database.
X. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this work we have studied the security of OPE and ORE
as they are used in real systems. We developed new cryptan-
alytic techniques for several extant OPE and ORE schemes
and evaluated them experimentally by performing plaintext
recovery attacks against ﬁrst and last names, birthdates, and
ZIP codes from several real datasets. Our attacks are effective
in fully recovering plaintexts from OPE and ORE ciphertexts.
Our work here has been empirical, but we believe our
attacks will prove effective against many other kinds of data
sets used in practice. We also leave as an open question
providing a more formal analysis of inference attacks. Future
work could also develop adaptive inference attacks, where
an attacker can make a limited number of adaptive chosen
plaintext queries while running an inference attack.
Our results suggest that OPE/ORE often provides only
marginal security for an important usage case. We believe
the results will generalize to other use cases. We also do not
know if these attacks are optimal, so future work may surface
even more damaging attacks. Given all this, we recommend
practitioners avoid using OPE/ORE if possible. In some
deployment scenarios the only practical alternative in the
short term is leaving data in the clear, and here OPE/ORE
is clearly better than no encryption. For such cases, we hope
our methodologies can be used to help evaluate the security
achieved.
