ABSTRACT
The anonymous password authentication scheme proposed
in ACSAC’10 under an unorthodox approach of password
wrapped credentials advanced anonymous password authen-
tication to be a practically ready primitive, and it is being
standardized.
In this paper, we improve on that scheme
by proposing a new method of “public key suppression” for
achieving server-designated credential veriﬁability, a core
technicality in materializing the concept of password wrapped
credential. Besides better performance, our new method
simpliﬁes the conﬁguration of the authentication server, ren-
dering the resulting scheme even more practical. Further, we
extend the idea of password wrapped credential to biometric
wrapped credential, to achieve anonymous biometric authen-
tication. As expected, biometric wrapped credentials help
break the linear server-side computation barrier intrinsic in
the standard setting of biometric authentication. Experi-
mental results validate the feasibility of realizing eﬃcient
anonymous biometric authentication.

1.1 Anonymous Password Authentication
Anonymous password authentication (APA) strengthens
regular password authentication with the protection of user
privacy, in such a way that login sessions made by the same
user cannot be linked even by the authentication server, not

to mention the outsiders who eavesdrop on the communica-
tions. APA is a quite useful entity authentication primitive,
having many practical applications, e.g., it can enable the
employees of an organization to provide critical feedbacks
on the management, without the fear of retaliatory actions;
another example is that it helps users engage anonymously
in the online medical consultation services, with no worry of
embarrassment. Recognizing its importance and practicali-
ty, ISO/IEC is now in the process of standardizing anony-
mous password authentication [19].
As per the taxonomy in [19], APA schemes are catego-
rized into two classes: password only APA and storage ex-
tra APA. In particular, password only APA works in the
standard setting of password authentication, where the au-
thentication server keeps a password database containing all
enrolled users’ passwords (or password-derived quantities),
and the password between a user and the server is the on-
ly secret that is used by the two parties to perform entity
authentication. An inherent limitation of the password only
schemes is the linear server-side computation (linear to the
total number of enrolled users), which is clearly problemat-
ic when the number of enrolled users is not small. To get
around this issue, in ACSAC’09 the storage extra approach
was proposed [41].
Central to the storage extra approach is the concept of
password wrapped credential. More speciﬁcally, a user is is-
sued a credential to be used for entity authentication, and
she protects the credential with her password (e.g., encrypt-
ing the credential with a key derived from password) by gen-
erating a password wrapped credential; subsequently when
authenticating to the server, the user ﬁrst recovers the au-
thentication credential from her password wrapped creden-
tial using her password, and then engages in the authenti-
cation process with the use of the credential. It can be seen
that the server-side computation in authenticating the user
is the cost to verify the validity of the user’s authentication
credential, thus independent of the total number of enrolled
users. The approach requires a storage facility to store a us-
er’ password wrapped credential (so it is called storage extra
approach), but the facility needs not be secure, and it can
be any device, even a public directory, to retain portability
- the deﬁning feature of passwords.
In ACSAC’10 the same authors [42] further enhanced their
141ACSAC’09 scheme with a set of more eﬃcient building block-
s, coupled with solutions to some important practical issues
such as membership withdrawal and online guessing attack-
s. The resulting scheme basically brought anonymous pass-
word authentication to be a practically usable primitive, as
it appeared to have solved all major technical issues that
may occur in practical deployment. A manifestation to this
is that the ACSAC’10 scheme was selected as a candidate
to be standardized by ISO/IEC [19], representing the state-
of-the-art in the storage extra APA genre.
Regardless, we ﬁnd that the ACSAC’10 scheme can still be
further improved. Our observation is that a core technicality
in materializing the concept of password wrapped credential
is to prevent oﬄine guessing attacks from recovering the un-
derlying authentication credential from a password wrapped
credential - anyone can enumerate every possible password
to “unwrap” the password wrapped credential until a valid
credential is produced (password wrapped credentials are
public by assumption). Both [41, 42] tackled this issue with
the same method: to smash the public veriﬁability of an au-
thentication credential by encrypting certain credential ele-
ments under the server’s homomorphic encryption, so that
only the server can verify credential validity. In this work
we propose a new method to attain such server-designated
veriﬁability1 - the server simply suppresses the public key of
the underlying authentication credential scheme, such that
no one else than the server can check the authenticity of cre-
dentials. Better eﬃciency aside, this new method simpliﬁes
the system conﬁguration, as the authentication server does
not need to have homomorphic encryption in its possession.
1.2 From APA to Anonymous Biometric Au-
thentication
We further extend the idea of password wrapped creden-
tials to biometric wrapped credentials, to achieve anonymous
biometric authentication/identiﬁcation. Biometric authen-
tication concerns authenticating a user based on the biomet-
rics derived from her physical traits or behavioral pattern-
s. Biometrics are commonly believed to succeed passwords
in the long run, because biometrics also feature portability
while not suﬀering low entropy. The motivation for anony-
mous biometric authentication is derived either by taking
anonymous biometric authentication as successor of anony-
mous password authentication in speciﬁc, or from the neces-
sity of provision of user anonymity in entity authentication
in general (anyhow, biometric authentication is an entity
authentication technique). The typical setting of biometric
authentication is quite similar to password authentication:
each user enrolls a biometric sample (the enrolled sample is
often refereed to as template) to the authentication server,
which ends up maintaining a database containing all en-
rolled users’ templates; a subsequent authentication of a
1The server-designated veriﬁability seems similar to Desig-
nated Veriﬁer Signature with the designated veriﬁer being
the server.
In fact, server-designated veriﬁability is much
more stringent than Designated Veriﬁer Signature: (1) ﬁrst
of all, ordinary Designated Veriﬁer Signature does not pro-
vide signer anonymity; (2) more importantly, if using so
called Anonymous Designated Veriﬁer Signature such as [13]
which provides signer anonymity to instantiate password
wrapped credential, then both of signatures and the user
signing key are required to be veriﬁable only to the designat-
ed veriﬁer. Unfortunately, Anonymous Designated Veriﬁer
Signature only achieves designated veriﬁability of signatures.
user is dependent on the comparison of a fresh biometric
reading of the claimant with her enrolled template in the
template database. Under such a setting, it is apparent
that to achieve user unlinkability towards the server (i.e.,
two authentication sessions from the same user cannot be
recognized as such by the server), by no means can the serv-
er perform asymptotically better than linear computation
(with respect to the total number of enrolled users). Worse
yet, the complexity of template/reading matching further
aggravates the server’s actual workload.
Motivated by the role password wrapped credentials play
in storage extra APA, we expect biometric wrapped creden-
tials to play a similar role in breaking the linear server-side
computation barrier inherent in achieving anonymous bio-
metric authentication in the standard setting. The concept
of biometric wrapped credential is akin to password wrapped
credential - a user wraps her authentication credential with
her biometric information, and only herself can do unwrap-
ping as only she can produce biometric samples approximate
enough to that used in wrapping. The noisy nature of bio-
metrics dictates that we are in need of a kind of “fuzzy wrap-
ping”, a main challenge in substantiating biometric wrapped
credential. To our delight, we ﬁnd out that many template
protection techniques in the biometrics ﬁeld, e.g., [3, 6, 20,
22, 33], can be exploited for “fuzzy wrapping”.
1.3 Our Contributions
Speciﬁcally, our contributions are summarized below.
• We improve on the ACSAC’10 APA scheme that is be-
ing standardized, by innovating in the way to achieve
server-designated credential veriﬁability, with a new
method of public key suppression. This new method
not only brings about better performance, but more
importantly, simpliﬁes system conﬁguration, which in
turn makes the resulting anonymous authentication
protocol simpler, and easier for security analysis. This
is especially important for practical deployment.
• We extend the concept of password wrapped credential
to biometric wrapped credential. Biometric wrapped
credentials help break the linear bound of server-side
computation in the standard setting, thus advancing
anonymous biometric authentication towards practi-
cality.
• We empirically tested our proposal for anonymous bio-
metric authentication, and the experimental results
demonstrated its feasibility.
Organization. We review related work in Section 2, fol-
lowed by an improvement to the ACSAC’10 scheme in Sec-
tion 3. The idea and materialization of biometric wrapped
credential is presented in Section 4. Experimental results
are reported in Section 5, and Section 6 concludes the work.
2. RELATED WORK
2.1 Anonymous Password Authentication
Password authentication has been widely studied in the
literature, e.g., [5, 8, 9, 14, 16, 21, 23, 39], to name a few.
For ease of memorization, users tend to choose short pass-
words from a relatively small space; thus passwords are of
142low entropy in nature, and susceptible to brute force guess-
ing attacks. As such, the best a password authentication
system can achieve is that an attacker can only validate his
guesses of a password by interacting with the authentication
server and seeing the server’s accept/reject responses. Such
online guessing attacks are unavoidable in password authen-
tication, but can be addressed with system level measures,
e.g., suspending one’s account once the number of failed lo-
gin attempts “she” made exceeds a threshold.
In general, password authentication does not consider pro-
tection of user privacy, as the authentication server needs to
know who the requesting user is and uses the corresponding
enrolled password to authenticate her. Anonymous pass-
word authentication (APA) was proposed to ﬁll this gap,
and the ﬁrst such a scheme was due to [37], which com-
bines a password authentication protocol with PIR (Private
Information Retrieval), with the former performing mutual
authentication, and the latter achieving user privacy protec-
tion. Afterwards, several new schemes were presented [24,
34, 40], all of which explicitly or implicitly make use of PIR,
and they diﬀer in the extent to which the server-side compu-
tation can be converted into pre-computation. The method
of pre-computation in fact trades communication for (real
time) online computation. APA was also studied with re-
gard to a three-party scenario (i.e., user-gateway-server) [1],
and the protocol still explicitly utilizes PIR.
It is not a surprise that all of [1, 24, 34, 37, 40] exploit
PIR in their schemes, as they consider APA in the standard
setting, where a password database is present at the server
side with each entry being a pair of ⟨user ID, password⟩.
Achieving user unlinkability amounts to letting the server
not know which entry of the database it actually uses to
authenticate a user, which in substance is a PIR problem
per se. As such, the lower bound for server-side computa-
tion is linear to the total number of entries in the password
database.
To break this bound, an unorthodox approach of password
