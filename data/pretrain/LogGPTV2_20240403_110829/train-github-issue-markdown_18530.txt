I am trying to figure out how to center an item in the navbar. I would
essentially like to be able to have two navs, one left and one right. Then
have an element (logo or CSS styled div) in the middle of the nav. It would be
nice to have something similar to .pull-right, a .pull-center or something to
assist with this. I have been trying to override the css and write it in
myself, but for the life of me can't get it to work right.
