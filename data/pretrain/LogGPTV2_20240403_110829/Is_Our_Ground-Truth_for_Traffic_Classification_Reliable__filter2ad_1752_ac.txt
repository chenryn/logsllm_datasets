### 4. Discussion

This section summarizes and discusses the key findings from the performance comparison of various traffic classification tools, as well as the limitations of our study.

**Summary of Results:**

Table 6 presents a summary of the results from Section 3. The Precision (first column) is calculated as the percentage of correctly classified flows out of the total number of flows. However, this metric is dependent on the dataset's distribution. To address this, we also compute the Average Precision, which is independent of the dataset's distribution. The Average Precision is calculated using the following formula:

\[
\text{Average Precision} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left( \frac{\text{correctly classified flows}_i}{\text{total flows}_i} \right)
\]

where \( N \) is the number of applications studied (in this case, \( N = 10 \)).

**Key Findings:**

- **PACE** is the best classifier, achieving 94.22% Precision and 91.01% Average Precision.
- **Libprotoident** achieves similar results to PACE, with 93.86% Precision and 84.16% Average Precision, despite only inspecting the first four bytes of payload for each direction.
- **L7-filter** and **NBAR** perform poorly, with L7-filter achieving 30.26% Precision and 38.13% Average Precision, and NBAR achieving 21.79% Precision and 46.72% Average Precision.
- **NDPI** shows moderate performance, with 57.91% Precision and 82.48% Average Precision.

**Limitations:**

- The conclusions are tied to the specific dataset used in the study. Although efforts were made to emulate real user behavior, many applications, behaviors, and configurations are not represented.
- The dataset includes 10 well-known applications, but adding more applications like Skype or Spotify is part of our ongoing future work.
- The traffic generated for the dataset, while manually and realistically created, is artificial. Real backbone traffic may exhibit different behaviors that are not fully captured in the dataset (e.g., P2P clients running on port 80).
- Therefore, the performance of the tools studied cannot be directly extrapolated to all scenarios, but it provides an idea of their precision for the evaluated set of applications.

### 5. Conclusions

This paper represents the first step towards validating the reliability of network traffic classifiers. We compared the performance of six tools—PACE, OpenDPI, L7-filter, NDPI, Libprotoident, and NBAR—commonly used for traffic classification. Our results show that PACE is the most reliable solution on our dataset. Among the open-source tools, NDPI and especially Libprotoident present the best results. In contrast, NBAR and L7-filter have several inaccuracies, making them less suitable as ground-truth generators.

To ensure the reliability of the study, we created a dataset using VBS [13], which associates the name of the process with each flow, ensuring accurate labeling. The dataset contains over 500,000 flows from popular applications such as HTTP, Edonkey, BitTorrent, FTP, DNS, NTP, RDP, NETBIOS, SSH, and RDP, totaling 32.61 GB of data. This dataset, including full packet payloads, is released to the research community for use as a common reference for comparing and validating network traffic classifiers.

**Future Work:**

- Extend the dataset by adding new applications (e.g., Skype, Games) and focusing on HTTP-based applications.
- Introduce new tools to the study (e.g., NBAR2).
