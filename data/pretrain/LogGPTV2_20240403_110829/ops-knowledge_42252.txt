User: How to enable the SSH service in the Linux system for remote access to the server?
Assistant: 1. Enter in the command line: sudo apt-get install openssh-server This command will install the SSH service to your Linux system. 2. After the installation is complete, enter: sudo service ssh start to start the SSH service. 3. If you want to start the SSH service automatically when the system starts, you can enter: sudo systemctl enable ssh. 4. Open the SSH port 22 in the firewall, the command is as follows: sudo ufw allow ssh 5. Then, you can use the SSH client to connect to the Linux server. Note: If you have installed SSH service on your Linux system, but you cannot connect to the server, you need to check whether the SSH configuration file /etc/ssh/sshd_config allows remote access, and whether the firewall allows SSH connections. By modifying these settings, you can resolve SSH connection issues.
