User: Please explain the common forms of security attacks and corresponding defense measures.
Assistant: 1. Email phishing (Phishing): This type of attack sends emails or information masquerading as legitimate organizations or services to users, luring them into disclosing sensitive information, such as passwords and bank account numbers. Defenses include educating users about these types of scams and using mail filters to block spam and phishing emails. 2. Malware (Malware): including viruses, Trojan horses, spyware, etc., and they all destroy system security and even steal information. Antivirus software and firewalls should be updated frequently, avoid visiting suspicious websites, and regularly back up important data. 3. Cyber Attack: Cyber attackers can use a variety of techniques to invade and manipulate network systems, such as Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS). Defensive measures can include implementing access control measures, monitoring network traffic and establishing alert systems, and using firewalls and intrusion detection systems (IDS), among others. 4. Brute Force Attack: This attack is carried out by multiple attempts to crack the password. Defensive measures include: Strong passwords are a basic measure, authentication mechanisms such as two-factor authentication (2FA) can be used for added security, and limits on the number of login attempts can be set, while using a firewall located outside the external network to protect the internal network . 5. Eavesdropping and data analysis (eavesdropping, data analysis): This attack method obtains sensitive information through network monitoring or intercepting data packets. Defense methods can include encrypting transmitted data, using VPNs, etc. to establish secure channels, installing encryption protocols on malicious nodes, setting access controls, and using data encryption technologies, etc.
