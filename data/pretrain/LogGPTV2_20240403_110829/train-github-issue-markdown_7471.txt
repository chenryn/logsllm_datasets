Hi - question about VSCode extension support for python (or other languages).
I am commenting here since the Q&A section for the extension marketplace links
here.
Is it possible to run python tests and explore locators, etc, in the middle of
debug for python too? All the documentations and examples are in javascript
(understandable).
I have installed the extension and it appears in the "testing" tab. But when I
run my (pytest) tests, the "show browser" opens a different browser and not
related to the current test. If I try `pw.extension.command.inspect` from
command pallette similarly, a new chromium opens up (not the one in my test).
I have to open a separate codegen window and follow along to explore locators,
which is inconvenient.
I hope I am wrong and have missed some configuration steps. If not currently
supported, is there a workaround? Or plan to support?
    def test_goto_google(page):
        page.goto("https://google.com")
^^^ I can debug my test here and with it stopped, I am trying to "inspect".
