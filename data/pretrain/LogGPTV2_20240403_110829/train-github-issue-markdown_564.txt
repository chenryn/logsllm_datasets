**What you expected to happen** :  
If this is expected behaviour i would like to be able to supress those
messages with --v=2
**How to reproduce it** (as minimally and precisely as possible):  
I think it would be sufficient to run scheduler or controller-manager with
`--leader-elect?true`.
etcdctl get registry/services/endpoints/kube-system/kube-controller-manager
looks like this:
    {
        "kind": "Endpoints",
        "apiVersion": "v1",
        "metadata": {
            "name": "kube-controller-manager",
            "namespace": "kube-system",
            "selfLink": "/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/endpoints/kube-controller-manager",
            "uid": "b9ee7a6f-8f82-11e6-b186-0050568802e1",
            "creationTimestamp": "2016-10-11T07:17:10Z",
            "annotations": {
                "control-plane.alpha.kubernetes.io/leader": "{\"holderIdentity\":\"utv-kube03\",\"leaseDurationSeconds\":15,\"acquireTime\":\"2016-10-11T07:17:10Z\",\"renewTime\":\"2016-10-12T07:18:54Z\",\"leaderTransitions\":0}"
            }
        },
        "subsets": []
    }
The cluster seems healthy and are scheduling pods correctly.
