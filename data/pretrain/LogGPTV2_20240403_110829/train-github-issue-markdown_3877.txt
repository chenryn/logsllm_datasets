For further reference, please see issue #8561: <http://play.golang.org/p/VYrNcjJ_Qo>.

The code compiles without any issues but will result in a guaranteed runtime failure. The methods `m` in types `T1` and `T2` have conflicting signatures, which means that a variable `x` with a static type of `T1` cannot possibly be of type `T2`.

According to the Go language specification, there is no requirement for method signatures to be conflict-free when performing type assertions (refer to <http://tip.golang.org/ref/spec#Type_assertions>):

> "If T is an interface type, `x.(T)` asserts that the dynamic type of x implements the interface T."

However, when it comes to interface assignments, conflicting method signatures are not allowed. For example, consider the following code from <http://play.golang.org/p/QAZWsPqejr>:

```go
prog.go:13: cannot use x2 (type T2) as type T1 in assignment:
    T2 does not implement T1 (wrong type for m method)
        have m(string)
        want m(int)

prog.go:14: cannot use x1 (type T1) as type T2 in assignment:
    T1 does not implement T2 (wrong type for m method)
        have m(int)
        want m(string)
```

In this case, the compiler correctly identifies that `T2` does not implement `T1` and vice versa, due to the conflicting method signatures.
