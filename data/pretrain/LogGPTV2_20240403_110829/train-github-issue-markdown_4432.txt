When I split my view horizontally, I find the duplicate status bars to be
somewhat wasteful of real estate. I'm wondering if it wouldn't be better to
have a single status bar at the bottom that changes its display depending on
the active editor, like Sublime has. We already have the filename in the tab
bar. Although this may be sad for Emacs people who like to disable the tabs.
