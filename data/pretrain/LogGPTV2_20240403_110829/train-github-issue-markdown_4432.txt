When I split my view horizontally, I notice that the duplicate status bars consume a significant amount of screen real estate. I am considering whether it would be more efficient to have a single, dynamic status bar at the bottom that updates based on the active editor, similar to the approach used in Sublime Text. The filename is already displayed in the tab bar, so this change could streamline the interface. However, I understand that this may not be ideal for users who prefer to disable tabs, such as those accustomed to Emacs.
