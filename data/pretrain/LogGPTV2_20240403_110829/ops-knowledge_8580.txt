User: How to complete personalized recommendations and services for websites and apps based on user behavior data? Please provide a basic algorithm and technical architecture proposal.
Assistant: Basic Algorithm: Collaborative Filtering Algorithm Technical Architecture Solution: 1. Data Collection: Collect user behavior data and user profile data into the data warehouse. Tools such as Flume or Kafka can be used for log data collection, and Sqoop can be used for relational database data collection. 2. Data preprocessing: use Spark and other technologies to process raw data, clean, filter, and transform. For example, the user click log is transformed into an interaction matrix between users and items. 3. User portrait: According to the user's historical behavior and user attribute information, a user portrait is established for personalized recommendation. 4. Feature extraction: Extract the features of users and products from different dimensions such as users, products, and interactions between users and products, and use them to calculate similarity. 5. Collaborative filtering algorithm: use the user-based or item-based collaborative filtering algorithm to calculate the similarity between users or products, and recommend products for each user based on the similarity. 6. Sorting of recommendation results: sort the recommendation results according to various factors, such as similarity, popularity, price, etc., to provide users with the best recommendation results.
