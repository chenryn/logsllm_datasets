When I execute the following command:
```bash
deno test --fail-fast --coverage=x && deno coverage x
```
I achieve nearly 100% code coverage. However, the last empty trailing line is causing an issue. The output indicates that the coverage is slightly less than 100% due to this line:

```
cover file:///path/quality.js ... 98.148% (53/54)
      54 | 
```

This empty trailing line should be accounted for in the coverage report.

Environment details:
- Deno: 1.15.3 (release, x86_64-apple-darwin)
- V8: 9.5.172.19
- TypeScript: 4.4.2

Please ensure that the empty trailing line is properly handled to achieve full code coverage.
