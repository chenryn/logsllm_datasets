Whenever i run: `deno test --fail-fast --coverage=x && deno coverage x`  
then i get almost 100% code coverage.
the issue is with the last empty trailing line...
    cover file:///path/quality.js ... 98.148% (53/54)
      54 | 
This should be accounted for
deno 1.15.3 (release, x86_64-apple-darwin)  
v8 9.5.172.19  
typescript 4.4.2
