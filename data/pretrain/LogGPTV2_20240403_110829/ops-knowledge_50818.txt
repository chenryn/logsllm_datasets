I have a Python program that automates the setup of a WordPress site on my server. The script downloads and unzips the WordPress package, sets up the database and user, and configures the `wp-config.php` file. Now, I would like to call the `wp_install` function from `wp-admin/includes/upgrade.php` and pass it the necessary parameters such as `$weblog_title`, `$user_name`, and `$admin_email`.

My question is: How can I call this `wp_install` function from my Python script? Can I use `urllib` or `urllib2` for this purpose, and if so, how do I call the `wp_install` function with the correct parameters?

The `wp_install` function is typically called during the first step of the installation process in `/wp-admin/install.php`, after the form data has been validated. If you submit the form with `?step=1` and include all the required form fields, it should trigger the `wp_install` function.

Yes, you can use `urllib` (or `urllib2` in Python 2) to make an HTTP request to the WordPress installation script. Here’s how you can do it:

1. **Prepare the Form Data**: Collect the required form fields, such as `weblog_title`, `user_name`, `admin_email`, etc.
2. **Make the HTTP Request**: Use `urllib` to send a POST request to the WordPress installation script.

Here’s an example using `urllib` in Python 3:

```python
import urllib.parse
import urllib.request

# Define the URL of the WordPress install script
url = 'http://your-domain.com/wp-admin/install.php'

# Prepare the form data
data = {
    'step': '1',
    'weblog_title': 'Your Blog Title',
    'user_name': 'admin_username',
    'admin_email': 'admin@example.com',
    # Add other required form fields here
}

# Encode the form data
encoded_data = urllib.parse.urlencode(data).encode('utf-8')

# Make the POST request
req = urllib.request.Request(url, data=encoded_data, method='POST')
with urllib.request.urlopen(req) as response:
    content = response.read()
    print(content.decode('utf-8'))
```

This script will send a POST request to the WordPress installation script, triggering the `wp_install` function with the provided parameters. Ensure that the URL and form data are correctly set for your specific setup.
