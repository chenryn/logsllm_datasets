User: I have a python program that sets up a wordpress site on my server. It downloads the zip and unzips it into a directory, sets up the database and user, configures the config file. Now I would like to call the the wp_install function in wp-admin/include/upgrade.php and pass it the parameters it needs $weblog_title, $user_name, $admin_email ... 
My question is how can I call this function from python? Can I do a urllib.urlopen and if so how do I call the wp_install function with the right parameters?
Assistant: It looks like wp_install() gets called inside of /wp-admin/install.php during step 1, and after form data has been validated.  If you submit ?step=1& ... (all of the other required form fields) it should result in calling wp_install.  So yes, you should be able to use urllib(2) for this.
