    interface Bank {
        balance: number;
        withdraw(x: number): number;
    }
    class PowellCountyBank implements Bank {
        balance: number = 0;
        withdraw(x) {
            return (this.balance - x);
        }
    }
    var b = new PowellCountyBank();
    console.log(b.withdraw({}));
                         // ^ Expect type error here.
(Playground)
The implementation shows the return type of `withdraw` but not type for the
parameter:
