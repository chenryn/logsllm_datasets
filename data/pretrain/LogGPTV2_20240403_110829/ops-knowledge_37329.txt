User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Do you run antivirus on your Windows servers? Here's an argument that I've had at over a dozen companies:
Should you install an antivirus client on your Windows servers?
Obviously, you should not install AV on your SQL Server. I think there is also a general consensus that it doesn't belong on your web server.
But what about all of the other servers in an enterprise?

Exchange
Active Directory
File server
OCS
Utility servers
etc

Do you think it's appropriate to run AV on those machines?

Assistant: Yes, although for the most part they are configured to scan for viruses overnight with real-time file protection disabled, the exceptions are:


File servers - Set to scan on write only. Full nightly scan.
Sharepoint - No current anti-virus, waiting on Sophos for SharePoint to come out of beta.
Exchange - Exchange specific anti-virus soloution. Overnight scans exclude data stores.
Application Servers - SQL Data stores excluded from overnight scans.
AD/DC/DHCP - Overnight scan set to exclude service specific data files and logs
