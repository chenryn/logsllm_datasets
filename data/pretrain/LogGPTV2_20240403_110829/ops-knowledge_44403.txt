User: I am currently in a course that is using OpenGL and I have been using C for all the programs so far. I have Python installed on Fedora as well as OpenGL, however the minute I call an OpenGL command in my Python code, I get a segmentation fault. I have no idea why this is.
Just to avoid the "just use C" comments, here is why I want to use Python:
There are a couple reasons I am wanting to switch from C to Python, but the main one is because we are about to start writing a raytracer and I would like to use classes to make it easier on me. Since I hate classes in C++ and structs in C seems a little crazy, I thought I would give Python a try at it. I have also been looking for a reason to use Python again as it has been a while.
Thanks for any help.
Assistant: What OpenGL library are you using?  What windowing library?  What version of Python?
Most likely cause I can think of is that your windowing library (SDL or whatever you're using) isn't initializing OpenGL before you start calling into it.
