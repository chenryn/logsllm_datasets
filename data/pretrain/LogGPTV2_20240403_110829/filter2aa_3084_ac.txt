It consists of two steps, DNS packet ﬁltering and data cleansing. The packet ﬁltering step
ensures that only DNS packets remain in the ﬁltered network trafﬁc. Furthermore, this
research assumes that a third-party security mechanism is deployed in the network to
prevent or detect DNS fragmentation packets. Therefore, the proposed approach
incorporates the third-party mechanism to ensure that the DNS fragmented packet will
not bypass the proposed rules.
DNS packet filtering step
The process of resolving DNS queries occurs nearly instantaneously most of the time.
Since there is no need for a handshaking technique provided by Transmission Control
Protocol (TCP), DNS trafﬁc uses User Datagram Protocol (UDP) at port 53, making the
ﬁltering process easier. Furthermore, this study focuses on the analysis of selected features
of DNS. The ﬁltering step is responsible for the extraction of the required DNS features
from DNS packets. Figure 10 illustrates the process of the data pre-processing stage.
Figure 11 visualises the DNS packet structure. Table 4 tabulates the extracted DNS
trafﬁc ﬁelds selected for this study. Finally, Table 5 presents the extracted DNS record types
with their function in the DNS protocol.

Data cleansing step
Cleansing the data means removing errors and broken DNS sessions from the datasets.
Thus, the cleaning process helps achieve more accurate results and reduces the processing
time of subsequent stages (Alieyan et al., 2021).

DNS traffic analysis
The DNS trafﬁc analysis stage consists of enriched features calculations (feature
engineering) and building training dataset steps. The following subsection provides a more
detailed explanation for each step.
Enriched features calculations (feature engineering) step
The feature engineering process employs different machine learning domains to solve
various types of problems. Its main task is to select and compute the most signiﬁcant
features or attributes and eliminate irrelevant and redundant features to improve machine
learning algorithms’ performance. In this study, the feature engineering process derives
enriched DNS features from the basic extracted features in Stage 1.
Based on the review of existing literature and studies, we considered two signiﬁcant
characteristics of DNS-based botnet in its connection phase. Firstly, DNS-based botnet
generates a massive number of domain names. Secondly, the generated domain names
tend to be random and different from the human-generated ones (Alieyan et al., 2021).
The calculation of randomness of domain names could help to distinguish anomalous
trafﬁc and benign trafﬁc. In information theory, the randomness could be calculated by the
Shannon entropy equation, ﬁrst introduced by Claude E. Shannon in his paper titled “A
Mathematical Theory of Communication” (1948). Shannon entropy allows estimating “the
average minimum number of bits needed to encode a string of symbols based on the
alphabet size and the frequency of the symbols.” Moreover, Shannon entropy is also being

Since bots repeatedly tried to connect with the botmaster’s C&C server, the number of
domain resolution requests will be high. The proposed methodology for trafﬁc analysis is
to group the requested domain according to source IP. Since the bot or botnet tries to
connect with the botmaster in different predeﬁned periods, the average entropy for the
source IP is essential to distinguish between benign and malicious trafﬁc. Furthermore, we
use the same time value, 5 s, for ﬂow analysis based on a previous study (Alieyan, 2018).
Equation (2) calculates the average domain entropy feature (F1).

where N denotes the number of domain requests in a predeﬁned time (5 s), and H x
ð Þ is
as mentioned in Eq. (1). Moreover, as previously mentioned, a botnet in the rallying phase
repeatedly tries to connect with its C&C server. Since the C&C server is usually conﬁgured
with a single or only a few domains from the pool of vast numbers of bot-generated
domain names, many failed domain name resolution requests occur before the bot
successfully connects with the registered C&C domains. Such actions will increase the
NXDOMAIN response ratio from the infected network or host, indicating anomalous
behaviour (Wang et al., 2017). Furthermore, regular users usually have different domain
request time patterns, whereas the infected host endeavour to connect with their C&C
server according to a pre-programmed schema. Consequently, the time for domain request
entropy in legitimate hosts diverges from the infected ones (Qi et al., 2018).
Furthermore, the values of legitimate DNS lookup type requests and DNS record types,
as stated in Table 5, will differ from the values in an infected host since that user’s
behaviour in requesting domain resolution is different from the bot-generated request
(Hikaru et al., 2018). Likewise, the attackers exploit fast-ﬂux by combining round-robin IP
addresses with a short TTL for the DNS Resource Record (RR) (William & Danford, 2008),
leading to different TTL settings for the malicious domains.
Based on the characteristics mentioned above, the equations for the calculation of the
enriched feature are as follows:
R is the ratio of the successful DNS response within a predeﬁned time, which is also the
deﬁnition of the second feature (F2):
R ¼ Rs
Rn

where Rs represents the number of successful DNS responses, and Rn represents the
