### Title: SSO Wars: The Token Menace

**Year 2019: A Time of Apparent Peace and Prosperity**

Humanity has seemingly triumphed in its long-standing battle against Single-Sign-On (SSO) vulnerabilities. The last known bugs were discovered and eradicated, ushering in an era of security and stability for the Auth Federation. However, beneath this veneer of peace, new threats are emerging at the core of major SSO implementation libraries. This could be the final opportunity for malicious actors to launch a large-scale attack on the Auth Federation.

**New Techniques and Threats**

In this talk, we will unveil two significant new techniques that pose a serious threat to SSO systems:

1. **A New Breed of SAML Implementation Flaws:**
   - **Description:** These flaws break XML signature validation, allowing attackers to arbitrarily modify SAML assertions.
   - **Impact:** Attackers can authenticate as any user or grant themselves unauthorized access to sensitive resources.
   - **Affected Systems:** While any SAML implementation may be vulnerable, we will specifically demonstrate how these flaws affect:
     - Microsoft Windows Identity Framework (WIF) applications
     - Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) web services
     - Flagship products such as SharePoint and Exchange Servers

2. **A Critical Bug in the .NET Crypto Library:**
   - **Description:** This bug can be exploited to gain Remote Code Execution (RCE) or cause Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.
   - **Impact:** The severity of the attack depends on the availability of code gadgets in the target server.
   - **Potential Consequences:** Unauthorized execution of arbitrary code or disruption of service, leading to significant security breaches.

**Detection and Mitigation**

To combat these emerging threats, we will also introduce a new tool designed to detect and mitigate these types of vulnerabilities. This tool will be discussed in detail and made available to the community.

By understanding and addressing these new threats, we can continue to ensure the security and integrity of SSO systems, safeguarding the digital world from the next wave of attacks.
