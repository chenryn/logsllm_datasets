User: How to Use the netstat Command to Realize Network Traffic Monitoring in Linux Environment?
Assistant: You can use the netstat command combined with the pipe character and the grep command to monitor network traffic. 1. Open a terminal and enter the following command to view all TCP and UDP connections: ``` netstat -tuna ``` 2. Pipe the result to the grep command to filter the network connections you want to monitor: ``` netstat - tuna | grep "ESTABLISHED" ``` The above command will display all established TCP connections. 3. To continuously monitor the network connection, you can use it in conjunction with the watch command: ``` watch -n 1 "netstat -tuna | grep 'ESTABLISHED'" ``` The above command will display the established TCP in real time every 1 second connect. 4. To monitor the network connections of a specific process, you can use the following command: ``` netstat -tulanp | grep <PID corresponding to the process> ``` The above command will display all TCP and UDP connections of the process.
