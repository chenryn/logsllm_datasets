Subject: Issue with Django Installation on Mac

Dear Support,

I am encountering a problem while setting up Django on my Mac. After installing Python and Django, I attempted to create a new project using the command `django-admin.py startproject test1`. However, I received the following error:

```
1 11436 illegal hardware instruction django-admin.py startproject
test1
```

The number in the error message varies each time I run the command. I have tested this issue with multiple versions of Django and found that it only occurs with version 1.4 and higher. Version 1.3 works without any issues.

Despite extensive online research over the past week, I have not been able to find a solution to this specific problem. It is worth noting that I do not encounter this issue on my Ubuntu system at work.

To troubleshoot, I reinstalled my entire system and currently have the following software installed:
- Command Line Tools
- Homebrew
- Python & pip (via Homebrew)
- Git (via Homebrew)
- zsh (with .oh-my-zsh shell)

Even after setting up a virtual environment and installing Django 1.5.1, the same error persists.

Here is the crash log for Python:

I am now out of options and would greatly appreciate any assistance or insights you can provide regarding this issue.

Thank you,
