A Detailed Comparison with Other Methods
Besides the brief related work in Section 8, we also provide a
detailed comparison between FINAUTH and typical methods
published on top venues. The comparison consists of the
following aspects, including design goal, attack models, used
features, and classiﬁcation, which is shown in Table 10.
B Sensor Fusion based on EKF
We present the method for sensor data fusion based on EKF:
1. Initialize quaternion as Eq. 6.
2. Deﬁne the system state vector xxx as Eq. 5.
3. Apply normalization to three sensor data.

zzzm =
zzzg =

7. Update the covariance matrix of the estimate error PPPe.
C User Acceptance Study
PPPek
To ﬁnd out how users perceive FINAUTH, we recruited an-
other 43 subjects, including 12 females and 31 males. These
subjects did not participate in the data collections as shown
in 3. The subjects were asked to use FINAUTH to perform
authentication on their smartphones for one week, and then
rate our system. Instead of using system usability scale [20] to
measure usability, we focused on convenience, authentication
delay, and FRR by asking the following three questions to all
subjects:
Q1 Was it easy and convenient to use our system compared
to original ﬁngerprint authentication? (-2: Not at all, -1: Little,
0: Neutral, 1: Somewhat, 2: Very.)
Q2 Did you feel obvious delay during authentication com-
pared to the original ﬁngerprint authentication? (-2: Very, -1:
Somewhat, 0: Neutral, 1: Little, 2: Not at all.)
Q3 How often were you rejected by the FINAUTH? (-2:
Usually, -1: Often, 0: Seldom, 1: Rarely, 2: Never.)
For these questions, we employ 5 levels, from -2 to +2, to
represent different levels of user preferences, where +2 corre-
sponds to fully positive and -2 corresponds to fully negative
about the system experience. The average ratings of the three
questions are all positive at 1.93, 1.44, 1.81, respectively.

where PPP is the covariance matrix of the system, k is the
timestamp. Both PPPe and PPP are initialized with small val-
ues. We initialize PPPe and PPP as diag(10−4,10−4,10−4) and
diag(10−4,10−4,10−4,10−4,10−4,10−4,10−4) respectively,
where diag denotes diagonal matrix.
8. Update the gain of EKF with the covariance matrix PPPek.

where k is the timestamp.
10. Update the covariance matrix of the whole system.

gles as Eq. 7.
