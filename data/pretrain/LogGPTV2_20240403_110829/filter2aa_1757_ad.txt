YouTube conduct that forms the basis of this Complaint is 
not simply providing storage space, conduits, or other 
facilities to users who create their own websites with 
infringing materials.  To the contrary, YouTube itself 
commits the infringing duplication, public performance 
and public display of Plaintiff’s copyrighted works, and 
that infringement occurs on YouTube’s own website, which 
is operated and controlled by Defendants, not users.

 YouTube also allows any person to “embed” any video 
available in the YouTube library into another website (such 
as a blog, MySpace page, or any other page on the web 
where the user can post material).  … the user simply 
copies the “embed” code, which YouTube supplies for 
each video in its library, and then pastes that code into the 
other website, where the embedded video will appear as a 
television shaped picture with the YouTube logo 
prominently displayed…When a user clicks the plat icon, 
the embedded video plays within the context of the host 
website, but it is actually YouTube, not the host site, that 
publicly performs the video by transmitting the streaming 
video content from YouTube’s own servers to the viewer’s 
computer.

 Defendant’s have actual knowledge and clear notice of this 
massive infringement, which is obvious to even the most casual 
visitor to the site…. YouTube has the right and ability to control 
the massive infringement…Youtube has reserved to itself the 
unilateral right to impose Terms of Use to which users must agree 
… Youtube has the power and authority to police what occurs on 
its premise…. YouTube imposes a wide number of content based 
restrictions … reserves the unfettered right to block or remove 
any video.. Inappropriate.  YouTube proactively reviews and 
removes pornographic videos.

and repost it on Youtube.

 Viacom International, Inc. v. YouTube, LLC and Google, Inc., 
Civil Action No. 07 CV 2103 (S.D.N.Y. March 13, 2007)
 Section 512 (safe harbor) hosting companies not liable, as long as 
they don't turn a blind eye to copyright infringement and if they 
remove infringing material when notified. 
 YouTube does the second part through a formal posted policy and it 
prohibits uploads of unauthorized videos more than 10 minutes in
length. 
 Google confident that YouTube respects the legal rights of copyright 
holders and predicts courts will agree that the safe harbor applies 
only if the Web site does not financially benefit directly from the 
alleged infringing work.  Attorneys for Google said Section 512 
provides more than an ample shield that Web hosting companies like 
YouTube and blogging services enjoy a safe harbor.   
 Section 512 says Web site operators must not "receive a financial 
benefit directly attributable to the infringing activity" and that they 
must not be "aware of facts or circumstances from which infringing 
activity is apparent."

MGM Studios, Inc., v. Grokster, Ltd., 2005 U.S. LEXIS 5212 (U.S. June 27, 2005)
 Petitioner copyright holders sued respondent software distributors, alleging 
that the distributors were liable for copyright infringement because the 
software of the distributors was intended to allow users to infringe 
copyrighted works. Upon the grant of a writ of certiorari, the holders 
appealed the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth 
Circuit which affirmed summary judgment in favor of the distributors.  The 
distributors were aware that users employed their free software primarily to 
download copyrighted files, but the distributors contended that they could 
not be contributorily liable for the users' infringements since the software 
was capable of substantial noninfringing uses such as downloading works in 
the public domain. The U.S. Supreme Court unanimously held, however, that 
the distributors could be liable for contributory infringement, regardless of 
the software's lawful uses, based on evidence that the software was 
distributed with the principal, if not exclusive, object of promoting its use to 
infringe copyright. In addition to the distributors' knowledge of extensive 
infringement, the distributors expressly communicated to users the ability of 
the software to copy works and clearly expressed their intent to target 
former users of a similar service which was being challenged in court for 
facilitating copyright infringement. Further, the distributors made no 
attempt to develop filtering tools or mechanisms to diminish infringing 
activity, and the distributors' profit from advertisers clearly depended on 
high-volume use which was known to be infringing. The judgment affirming 
the grant of summary judgment to the distributors was vacated, and the case 
was remanded for further proceedings.

the preliminary injunction should be modified to prohibit the United States

ISP in the name of any resident of the Southern District of Ohio, pursuant 
to a court order issued under 2703(d), without either (1) providing the 
relevant account holder or subscriber prior notice and an opportunity to be

 United States v. Adjani, 452 F.3d 1140 (9th Cir. Cal. July 11, 2006)
 Government sought review of an order from the Court which granted a 
motion filed by defendant and codefendant to suppress their e-mail 
communications in their trial on charges of conspiring to commit
extortion and transmitting a threatening communication with intent to 
extort in violation.
 While executing a search warrant at defendant's home to obtain 
evidence of his alleged extortion, agents from the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation seized defendant's computer and external storage 
devices, which were later searched at an FBI computer lab. The agents 
also seized and subsequently searched a computer belonging to 
codefendant, who lived with defendant, even though she had not been 
identified as a suspect and was not named as a target in the warrant.

 Although individuals undoubtedly have a high expectation of privacy 
in the files stored on their personal computers, we have never held that 
agents may establish probable cause to search only those items owned 
or possessed by the criminal suspect. The law is to the contrary. "The 
critical element in a reasonable search is not that the owner of the 
property is suspected of crime but that there is reasonable cause to 
believe that the specific 'things' to be searched for and seized are 
located on the property to which entry is sought." Zurcher v. Stanford

 Warrant at issue sought authority to search for and seize any 
computer hardware, software, or storage devices that could   
contain evidence of Olander's means to access, store, and view 
child pornography. Defendant voluntarily subjected external 
portions of his computer to expert examination, after his 
computer was reasonably viewed as possibly part of the "entire 
computer system" used by David Olander and could have 
contained evidence of David Olander's crimes.
Seizures
 United States v. Olander, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 66824 (D. Ore. 
September 18, 2006)
 The computer was seized properly under the warrant as a possible
instrumentality of the crimes being investigated. The warrant 
allowed agents to search for and to seize "instrumentalities" that 
may contain evidence of the crime of possession of child 
pornography. There was a fair probability that defendant's 
computer contained evidence of David Olander's crimes and may 
have facilitated the commission of those crime. "The critical 
element in a reasonable search is not that the owner of the property 
is suspected of crime but that there is reasonable cause to believe 
that the specific 'things' to be searched for and seized are located on 
the property to which entry is sought."

 Defense counsel objects to the Magistrate Judge's R & R because 
he misunderstood the use and operation of computers, the internet, 
and technology and was, therefore, mislead by the Government 
into believing that there was an unequivocal factual basis to 
support the search warrant. The Defendant argues that the 
Magistrate Judge should have heard testimony from his expert 
regarding the inexactitude of the facts relied on to establish 
probable cause as follows: 1) Internet Protocol Addresses; 2) 
Activity on Defendant's Computer; 3) Dates and Times of 
Activities; 4) Where did the Files Come From; 5) File Names; 6) 
Need More Sources; 7) Banning Users; 8) Hackers and Spoofers,

downloaded files from Defendant's computer because the files 
could have easily been downloaded from another computer that 
was accessing the Defendant's IPA. Also anyone that accesses the
IPA through an unsecured wireless router can remotely access 
Defendant's computer and files can be downloaded, uploaded, or

 In order for the warrantless search of Defendant's offices to be
illegal, Defendant must first show that he had a reasonable 
expectation of privacy in the areas searched at the time of the 
search, after which he must still show that the search was 
unreasonable. See O'Connor v. Ortega, 480 U.S. 709, 107 S. Ct. 
1492, 94 L. Ed. 2d 714 (1987). Traditionally, to make this 
showing, the defendant "must demonstrate (1) that he had an 
expectation of privacy that society is prepared to consider 
reasonable and (2) that he had acted in a way with respect to 
the property in question that indicated a subjective expectation
of privacy." Shaul v. Cherry Valley-Springfield Cent. Sch., 363 
F.3d 177, 181-82 (2d Cir. 2004). The burden of showing 
standing -- "that he had a legitimate expectation of privacy" --
to object to the legality of a search rests with the defendant.
