### YouTube Conduct and Copyright Infringement

**Complaint:**
The conduct of YouTube that forms the basis of this complaint goes beyond merely providing storage, conduits, or other facilities for users who create their own websites with infringing materials. Instead, YouTube itself is responsible for the unauthorized duplication, public performance, and public display of the plaintiff's copyrighted works. These infringements occur on YouTube’s own website, which is operated and controlled by the defendants, not by the users.

**Embedding Videos:**
YouTube also allows any user to embed videos from its library onto other websites (such as blogs, MySpace pages, or any other web page where the user can post content). The user simply copies the "embed" code provided by YouTube for each video and pastes it into the host website. The embedded video appears as a television-shaped image with the YouTube logo prominently displayed. When a user clicks the play icon, the embedded video plays within the context of the host website, but it is YouTube, not the host site, that publicly performs the video by transmitting the streaming content from its servers to the viewer's computer.

**Knowledge and Control:**
The defendants have actual knowledge and clear notice of the extensive infringement occurring on the site, which is evident even to the most casual visitor. YouTube has the right and ability to control this massive infringement. It reserves the unilateral right to impose Terms of Use that users must agree to, and it has the power and authority to police what occurs on its platform. YouTube imposes a wide range of content-based restrictions and reserves the unfettered right to block or remove any video. For example, YouTube proactively reviews and removes pornographic videos.

**Failure to Employ Reasonable Measures:**
YouTube has failed to employ reasonable measures that could substantially reduce or eliminate the massive amount of copyright infringement. While YouTube touts the availability of purported copyright protection tools, these tools only prevent the upload of exact duplicate videos. Users routinely alter as little as a frame or two of a video and repost it on YouTube, circumventing these protections.

**Counts of Infringement:**
- **Count I:** Direct Copyright Infringement – Public Performance
- **Count II:** Direct Copyright Infringement – Public Display
- **Count III:** Direct Copyright Infringement – Reproduction
- **Count IV:** Inducement of Copyright Infringement
- **Count V:** Contributory Copyright Infringement
- **Count VI:** Vicarious Copyright Infringement

### Defendants' Response

**Safe Harbor Provisions:**
Section 512 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) provides a safe harbor for hosting companies, protecting them from liability as long as they do not turn a blind eye to copyright infringement and remove infringing material when notified. YouTube complies with this requirement through a formal posted policy and prohibits uploads of unauthorized videos longer than 10 minutes. Google is confident that YouTube respects the legal rights of copyright holders and predicts that the courts will agree that the safe harbor applies, especially if the website does not financially benefit directly from the alleged infringing work. Attorneys for Google argue that Section 512 provides more than an ample shield for web hosting companies like YouTube and blogging services.

**Financial Benefit and Awareness:**
Section 512 states that web site operators must not "receive a financial benefit directly attributable to the infringing activity" and must not be "aware of facts or circumstances from which infringing activity is apparent." Google and YouTube comply with these obligations and go well above and beyond what the law requires.

**Impact on Information Exchange:**
Viacom’s complaint threatens the way hundreds of millions of people legitimately exchange information, news, entertainment, and political and artistic expression.

### Related Case Law

**MGM Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd. (2005)**
- **Facts:** Petitioner copyright holders sued respondent software distributors, alleging that the distributors were liable for copyright infringement because their software was intended to allow users to infringe copyrighted works.
- **Holding:** The U.S. Supreme Court unanimously held that the distributors could be liable for contributory infringement, regardless of the software's lawful uses, based on evidence that the software was distributed with the principal, if not exclusive, object of promoting its use to infringe copyright. The distributors' profit from advertisers clearly depended on high-volume use, which was known to be infringing.

**Electronic Discovery and Searches**

**Cenveo Corp. v. Slater (2007)**
- **Court Ruling:** Due to the close relationship between the plaintiff's claims and the defendants' computer equipment, the court set out a detailed three-step process for imaging, recovery, and disclosure of electronic data.

**Warshak v. United States (2007)**
- **Ruling:** The district court correctly determined that e-mail users maintain a reasonable expectation of privacy in the content of their e-mails. The preliminary injunction should be modified to prohibit the seizure of personal e-mail accounts without prior notice and an opportunity to be heard, or a fact-specific showing that the account holder maintained no expectation of privacy.

**United States v. Adjani (2006)**
- **Ruling:** Although individuals have a high expectation of privacy in the files stored on their personal computers, agents may establish probable cause to search items owned or possessed by the criminal suspect. The critical element in a reasonable search is not the ownership of the property but the reasonable cause to believe that the specific things to be searched for and seized are located on the property.

**United States v. Olander (2006)**
- **Ruling:** The warrant allowed agents to search for and seize instrumentalities that may contain evidence of the crime of possession of child pornography. There was a fair probability that the defendant's computer contained evidence of the crimes and may have facilitated their commission.

**United States v. Hibble (2006)**
- **Ruling:** The defendant used an unsecured wireless router to access the internet, and he challenged the government's claim that files were downloaded from his computer. The court considered the possibility that the files could have been downloaded from another computer accessing the same IP address.

**United States v. Larson (2006)**
- **Ruling:** The military appellate court held that the servicemember had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the internet history files of the government computer, which were recorded automatically as part of the computer's operating system.

**United States v. Steiger (2006)**
- **Issues:** (1) An anonymous hacker who provided information to the police concerning the defendant was an agent of the government, thus violating the Fourth Amendment. (2) The government's search warrant affidavit omitted material information by failing to state that the hacker had obtained information through an unauthorized search of the defendant's computer files.

**United States v. Ziegler (2007)**
- **Ruling:** The employer consented to the search of the hard drive of the defendant's workplace computer, making the warrantless search reasonable under the Fourth Amendment. The court must determine whether the employee had an expectation of privacy in his workplace computer sufficient to suppress the images of child pornography sought to be admitted into evidence.

**Soderstrand v. State ex rel. Bd. of Regents of Okla. Agric. & Mech. Colleges (2006)**
- **Ruling:** The court held that the dean, associate dean, and security analyst were entitled to qualified immunity. The search of the hard drive was justified at inception, and its scope was reasonably related to the circumstances justifying it. No conduct violated the Fourth Amendment.

**United States v. Hassoun (2007)**
- **Ruling:** The FBI seized two computer disks from the defendant's work area and copied two hard drives and email associated with the defendant. The defendant did not have a legitimate expectation of privacy in the work computer, related components, and email seized.

**United States v. Venkataram (2007)**
- **Ruling:** To challenge the legality of a warrantless search, the defendant must first show a reasonable expectation of privacy in the areas searched and then demonstrate that the search was unreasonable. The burden of showing standing rests with the defendant.

### Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) - Civil Litigation

**Chas. S. Winner, Inc. v. Polistina (2007)**
- **Background:** The CFAA was historically a criminal statute penalizing unauthorized access, i.e., "hacking" into computers. It has been increasingly used in civil suits by employers to sue former employees and their new companies for misappropriation of information from the employer's computer system.
