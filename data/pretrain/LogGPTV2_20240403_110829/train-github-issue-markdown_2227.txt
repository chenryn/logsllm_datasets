Subject: Compatibility Issue with Scrapy 1.7.1 and Code Built with 1.6.0

Hello Team,

I hope this message finds you well.

I have a spider that was created using Scrapy version 1.6.0. Recently, Scrapy has been updated to version 1.7.1, and we have encountered an issue where the new version does not support the code built with the previous version (1.6.0).

Here is the error message we are receiving:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/bin/scrapy", line 6, in <module>
    from scrapy.cmdline import execute
  File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/scrapy/cmdline.py", line 10, in <module>
    from scrapy.crawler import CrawlerProcess

  File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/scrapy/utils/conf.py", line 4, in <module>
    import configparser
ImportError: No module named configparser
```

Could you please take some time to look into this issue? Your assistance would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your help.
