Hello All,
My spider is created by scrapy 1.6.0.  
These days, the scrapy updated to 1.7.1, and we found that it cannot support
the code build by 1.6.0.
Here is the error:
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/usr/bin/scrapy", line 6, in 
        from scrapy.cmdline import execute
      File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/scrapy/cmdline.py", line 10, in 
        from scrapy.crawler import CrawlerProcess
      File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/scrapy/crawler.py", line 11, in

      File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/scrapy/core/engine.py", line 14, in 
        from scrapy.core.scraper import Scraper
      File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/scrapy/core/scraper.py", line 18, in

      File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/scrapy/utils/conf.py", line 4, in 
        import configparser
    ImportError: No module named configparser
Would you please take time to check the issue?
Appreciate for your help in advance.
Thank you.
