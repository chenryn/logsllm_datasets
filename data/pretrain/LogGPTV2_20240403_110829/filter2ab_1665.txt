**ATT&CK ID:** S0034  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** NETEAGLE

If NETEAGLE does not detect a proxy configured on the infected machine, it will send beacons via UDP port 6000. After retrieving the C2 (Command and Control) server's IP address and port number, NETEAGLE initiates a TCP connection to this socket. The resulting connection is a plaintext C2 channel, where commands are specified using DWORDs (double words). [42]
