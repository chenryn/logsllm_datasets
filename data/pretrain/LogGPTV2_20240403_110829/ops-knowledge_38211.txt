### Optimized Text

I am developing a web frontend using Django for an LDAP server. The system involves different user roles with varying levels of access, so I have set up LDAP Access Control Lists (ACLs) to manage who can view or modify specific attributes.

Determining whether a user has read access is straightforward: I simply attempt to read the attribute and check if it succeeds. However, distinguishing between read and write access in a more elegant manner before attempting to write changes is proving challenging. I would like to clearly indicate in the interface whether the logged-in user has write access or is limited to read-only access. This way, users won't try to edit attributes they are not authorized to change.

One approach I considered is to temporarily write a dummy value to an attribute and then restore the original value. If the dummy write is successful, I know the user has write access and can display the attribute as editable. However, this method has a significant drawback: if the server crashes after the dummy value is written but before the original value is restored, the LDAP server will be left with dummy values.

What I need is a way to query the ACLs, similar to how I can query schema definitions. However, I suspect that querying ACLs directly might not be supported by LDAP.

**My Current Plan:**
I plan to implement the "test" approach, where I temporarily write a dummy value to determine write access. If this method proves too slow, I may introduce caching to improve performance.

**Rationale:**
I want to keep the ACL definitions solely on the LDAP server because there are other ways to interact with the server, such as command-line tools and standard LDAP utilities. By centralizing the ACL definitions, I can ensure that all interfaces remain synchronized and consistent.

Any suggestions or alternative approaches would be greatly appreciated.

Best regards,
