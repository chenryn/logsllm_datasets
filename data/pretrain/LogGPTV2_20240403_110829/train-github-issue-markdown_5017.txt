### Example
Here's a self-contained, minimal, reproducible, example with my use case:
    from pydantic import BaseModel
    from typing import Set
    from fastapi import FastAPI
    app = FastAPI()
    class Request(BaseModel):
        request_id: str
        def __hash__(self):
            return hash(self.request_id)
    class Requests(BaseModel):
        request_ids: Set[Request]
    @app.post("/test", response_model=Requests)
    def read_root(data: Requests):
        return data
### Description
Thanks to the Set feature, the deduplication step works ok for data IN.
however it fails for data OUT:
    curl -X 'POST'   'http://127.0.0.1:8000/test'   -H 'accept: application/json'   -H 'Content-Type: application/json'   -d '{
      "request_ids": [
        {
          "request_id": "c04ca7ee-f62c-4372-b667-73ace53c69c2"
        }
      ]
    }'
