 **Migrated issue, originally created by tosh**
Hi there,
I use SQLAlchemy 0.8.3 (so maybe it's fixed in newer releases) with MySQL
5.1.73.  
When I do the query
    Session.query(distinct(Model))
it generates something like
    SELECT DISTINCT :param_1 AS anon_1;
Where :param_1 is replaced with Model.__repr__() which is a simple string.
Maybe it would be more obvious if such SQLAlchemy-queries generated the
following code?
    SELECT DISTINCT id AS anon_1 FROM model_table;
Optionally, SQLAlchemy could raise an exception if a model was passed as an
argument.
