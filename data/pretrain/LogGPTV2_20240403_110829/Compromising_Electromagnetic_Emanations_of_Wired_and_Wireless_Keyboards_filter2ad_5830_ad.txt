### Emission Risks and Practical Challenges

Evaluating the emission risks of these attacks is a complex task. The results are highly dependent on several factors, including the antenna, trigger model, pass-band filters, and peak detection. In our experiments, we used basic filtering processes and simple signal processing techniques. These methods could be significantly improved by employing beamforming, smart antennas, advanced filters, and more sophisticated triggers.

### Real-World Measurements

Measurements in real-world environments, as opposed to the semi-anechoic chamber, are subject to significant variations due to electromagnetic interferences. Figure 13 lists the vulnerable keyboards across all setups, based on the four techniques described earlier. It is noteworthy that all tested keyboards (PS/2, USB, wireless, and laptop) are vulnerable to at least one of these attacks. For stable results, we first present the measurements from Setup 1 (semi-anechoic chamber).

### Results in the Semi-Anechoic Chamber

We consider an attack successful if we can correctly recover more than 95% of more than 500 keystrokes. The FETT, GTT, and MT were successful for all vulnerable keyboards within the semi-anechoic chamber, with a range of up to 5 meters. However, the MST was limited to a range of 2 to 5 meters, depending on the keyboard. Figure 14 shows the success probability of the MST according to the distance between the keyboard and the antenna.

**Figure 14: Success probability of the Matrix Scan Technique in the semi-anechoic chamber.**

The transition between a successful and failed attack is rapid. The recovery process's accuracy depends on the oscilloscope's trigger. If a peak is not detected, the captured signal is incomplete, leading to incorrect keystroke recovery. Under an SNR of 6 dB, peak detection becomes nearly impossible. The SNR is calculated as the average value of the peaks in volts divided by the RMS of the noise in volts.

Assuming 6 dB of SNR as a minimum, we estimated the theoretical maximum distance for successful keystroke recovery in the semi-anechoic chamber. Figure 15 provides the estimated maximum distance range for the weakest and strongest keyboards.

**Figure 15: Theoretically estimated maximum distance range to successfully recover 95% of keystrokes according to the four techniques in the semi-anechoic chamber.**

Figure 16 details the SNR for the FETT, GTT, MT, and MST on Keyboard A1 from 1 meter to 5 meters. This allows us to estimate the maximum range of these attacks based on their SNR.

### Results in Practical Environments

The second phase involved testing these techniques in practical environments, where the presence of strong electromagnetic background noise is a key factor. Despite this, all techniques remained applicable.

**Setup 2: The Office.** Figure 17 shows the success probability of the GTT on Keyboard A1 in the office, according to the distance between the antenna and the keyboard. The sharp transition is also observed when the SNR of the peaks falls below 6 dB. The maximum range of this attack is between 3 and 7.5 meters, depending on the keyboard. These values were unstable due to changing background noise and represent an average of multiple measurements.

**Figure 17: Success probability of the Generalized Transition Technique in the office.**

**Setup 3: The Adjacent Office.** The results in this setup were similar to those in the office, except that the wall, made of plaster and wood, reduced the SNR by 3 dB.

**Figure 18: Maximum range for the four techniques measured in the office.**

The Modulation Technique, which relies on a signal carrier, showed better results using the same trigger model as the FETT and GTT rather than just the carrier signal. The MST, which depends on peak detection, also exhibited the same attenuation when the SNR fell below 6 dB.
