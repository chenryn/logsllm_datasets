problematic in practical scenarios.
Evaluating the emission risks of these attacks is not
an easy task.
Indeed, these results highly depend on
the antenna, the trigger model, pass-band ﬁlters, peak
detection, etc. Moreover, we used trivial ﬁltering pro-
cesses and basic signal processing techniques. These
methods could be signiﬁcantly improved using beam-
forming, smart antennas, better ﬁlters and complex trig-
gers.
In addition, measurements in real environments
but the semi-anechoic chamber were subject to massive
change, depending on the electromagnetic interferences.
Figure 13 gives the list of vulnerable keyboards in all
setups, according to the four techniques previously de-
scribed. Note that all the tested keyboards (PS/2, USB,
wireless and laptop) are vulnerable to at least one of these
attacks. First, we present the measurements in Setup 1
(semi-anechoic chamber) to guarantee some stable re-
sults.

6.1 Results in the Semi-Anechoic Chamber
We consider an attack as successful when we are able
to correctly recover more than 95% of more than 500
keystrokes. The Falling Edge Transition Technique, the
Generalized Transition Technique and the Modulation
Technique are successful in the semi-anechoic chamber
11
for all vulnerable keyboards. This means that we can
recover the keystrokes (fully or partially) to at least 5
meters (the maximum distance inside the semi-anechoic
chamber). However, the Matrix Scan Technique is lim-
ited to a range of 2 to 5 meters, depending on the key-
board. Figure 14 represents the probability of success
of the Matrix Scan Technique according to the distance
between the tested keyboard and the antenna.

Figure 14: The success probability of the Matrix Scan
Technique in the semi-anechoic chamber according to
the distance.
We notice that the transition between a successful and
a missed attack is fast. Indeed, The correctness of the
recovery process is based on the trigger of the oscillo-
scope. If a peak is not detected, the captured signal is
incomplete and the recovered keystroke is wrong. Thus,
under a SNR of 6 dB there is nearly no chance to success-
fully detect the peaks. The SNR is computed according
to the average value of the peaks in volts divided by the
RMS of the noise in volts.
Considering 6 dB of SNR as a minimum, we are able
to estimate the theoretical maximum distance to suc-
cessfully recover the keystrokes for all techniques in the
semi-anechoic chamber. Figure 15 gives the estimated
maximum distance range according to the weakest and
the strongest keyboard.
In Figure 16 the upper graph gives the SNR of the
Falling Edge Transition Technique and the Generalized
Transition Technique on Keyboard A1 from 1 meter to
5 meters. The middle graph details the SNR (in dB) of
the strongest frequency carrier of the Modulation Tech-
nique for the same keyboard. Thus, we can estimate the
maximum range of these attacks according to their SNR.
The lower graph gives the SNR of the Matrix Scan Tech-
nique for the same keyboard. All the measurements were
collected in the semi-anechoic chamber.

6.2 Results in Practical Environments
The second phase is to test these techniques in some
practical environments. The main difference is the
presence of a strong electromagnetic background noise.
However, all the techniques remain applicable.
Setup 2: The Ofﬁce. Figure 17 gives the probability of
success of the Generalized Transition Technique on Key-
board A1 measured in the ofﬁce according to the distance
between the antenna and the keyboard. We notice that the
sharp transition is present as well when the SNR of the
peaks falls under 6 dB. The maximum range of this at-
tack is between 3 and 7.5 meters depending on the tested
keyboard. Note that these values were unstable due to a
changing background noise. They correspond to an av-
erage on multiple measurements.
Setup 3: The Adjacent Ofﬁce. Results on this setup
are basically the same as the previous setup (the ofﬁce),
except that the wall made of plaster and wood removes 3
dB to the SNR.

Figure 17: The success probability of the Generalized
Transition Technique in the ofﬁce, according to the dis-
tance between the keyboard and the antenna (biconical).
The Modulation Technique is based on a signal car-
rier. The SNR of this carrier should determine the range
of the attack. However, we obtained better results with
the same trigger model used in the Falling Edge Transi-
tion Technique and the Generalized Transition Technique
than one based on the carrier signal only.
Because the Matrix Scan Technique is related to the
detection of the peaks, we noticed the same attenuation
when the SNR falls under 6 dB. Figure 18 gives the max-
imum range for the four techniques measured in the of-
ﬁce.
