*While these services do not have ubiquitous HTTPS, no personalization is offered over HTTP pages.

### Threat Persistence

Invalidating session cookies upon user logout is a standard practice, especially for high-value services, which often invalidate cookies after a short period of inactivity. We examined whether the services also invalidate the HTTP cookies required for our hijacking attacks. Our findings indicate that even if the user explicitly logs out after the attacker has stolen the cookies, almost all cookies still retain access privileges and can carry out the attack. Thus, attackers can maintain access to the victim’s personal information and account functionality until the cookies’ set expiration date, which can be several months (Google cookies expire after 2 years). eBay was the only service among the vulnerable ones that invalidates the cookies after logging out. These cookies do not instruct the browser to expire upon exiting, indicating that eBay manages the cookies' validity on the server side.

### A. Google

Typically, an adversary can steal the victim’s HTTP cookie for Google by observing a connection to any page hosted on google.com where encryption is not enforced.

#### Cookie Hijacking

Google automatically redirects users connecting over HTTP to google.com to HTTPS to protect their searches from eavesdropping. However, upon the initial request, before being redirected and enforcing encrypted communication, the browser will send the HTTP cookies. Furthermore, the user can also use the address bar to visit Google services; for example, typing "www.google.com/maps" to visit Google Maps. Under these usage scenarios, the browser will again expose the user’s HTTP cookies, and if an adversary is monitoring the traffic, they can hijack them. Redirecting instead of enforcing HTTPS is likely a conscious decision to support legacy clients that do not run HTTPS (outdated User Agents are not redirected).

#### Browser Behavior

The adversary must observe an unencrypted connection to google.com, which may not occur under all scenarios. However, a very typical scenario is for the victim to use the browser’s address bar. Consequently, to understand the conditions under which the requirements will hold, we explored how popular browsers handle user input in the address bar when trying to visit google.com. As shown in Table III, for straightforward user input, popular browsers will connect to google.com over HTTP. Due to the autocomplete feature in certain browsers (e.g., Firefox), even if the victim types only "google," the autocomplete mechanism will add ".com," and the browser will again connect over HTTP. Therefore, under common browsing patterns, the existing design will expose a user’s cookie when visiting the main search engine. Interestingly, while the default iOS browser (Safari) exhibits the same behavior, Chrome on Android will connect to Google over HTTPS to securely prefetch page resources. However, if users turn this option off to improve performance, Android Chrome will also connect over HTTP.

#### HSTS Preloading

As described in Section II, major browsers employ pre-loading lists for HSTS. As seen in Listing 1, the preloaded HSTS policy for Chrome does not force the browser to connect to google.com over HTTPS. It does, however, employ certificate pinning, requiring an acceptable certificate if the browser is already connecting over HTTPS. This is applied to all local country-based variations of Google’s search engine and the main page itself. On the other hand, critical Google subdomains support HSTS preloading and are explicitly forced to connect over HTTPS. As a result, users that visit the Google search engine through the address bar will most likely connect over an unencrypted channel, and their cookies will be exposed.

#### Information Leakage

If the adversary simply visits google.com using the stolen cookie, no sensitive information will be accessible as the browser is redirected to HTTPS. However, if the adversary forces the browser to visit Google over HTTP, sensitive information can be accessed. During our auditing, we identified the following:

- **Personal Information:** Due to the cookie, Google considers the victim logged-in, resulting in personal information being leaked. As shown in Figure 3(a), we gain access to the user’s first and last name, Gmail address, and profile picture.

This detailed analysis highlights the extent of exposure and the potential risks associated with HTTP cookie hijacking attacks on popular services.
