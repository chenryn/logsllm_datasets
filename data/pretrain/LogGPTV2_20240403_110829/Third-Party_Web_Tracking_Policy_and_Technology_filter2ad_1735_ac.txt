sign-on with many identity providers.
D. Content Providers
Content providers host video, maps, news, weather,
stocks, and other media for embedding into websites. Some
content providers, including YouTube, offer third-party wid-
gets to both increase user engagement and generate revenue
through in-widget advertising. Many others, such as the
Associated Press, charge for their content.
E. Frontend Services
Several third parties host JavaScript libraries and APIs
that speed webpage loads (e.g. Google Libraries API) and
enable new page functionality (e.g. Google Feed API).
F. Hosting Platforms
Some third parties provide services that assist publishers
in distributing their own content, such as blog platforms
(e.g. Wordpress.com) and content distribution networks (e.g.
Akamai).
G. Market Trends
Krishnamurthy and Wills have collected longitudinal web
measurements of approximately 1,200 popular websites be-
tween 2006 and the present [74], [12], [13]. They report
two consistent trends. First, tracking companies are rapidly
increasing the share of websites that
they span. Large
including Google, Adobe, and Microsoft, have
trackers,
greatly extended their reach through acquisitions. Second,
the number of trackers per page is growing rapidly. Websites
now frequently embed content from dozens of third parties.

VI. ECONOMICS OF THIRD-PARTY WEB TRACKING
Proponents of web tracking often make the economic
claim that it is needed to subsidize web services through
advertising (e.g. [75], [76], [77], [78]). We believe the claim
is subject to debate [79], and central questions remain open:
• Which segments of the online advertising market de-
pend on third-party tracking, and how is it used? It
appears that only a small share of online advertising
is behaviorally targeted [79]. The extent
to which
advertising relies on other uses of tracking is unclear.
• What marginal tradeoffs do advertisers face for each
use of tracking information? If tracking-based adver-
tising becomes less feasible or more costly, advertisers
will reallocate their expenditures.17 How they choose
to reallocate will depend on the effectiveness and cost
of the next-best alternatives to tracking-based advertis-
ing. Note that effectiveness and cost point in opposite
directions—an advertiser may, for example, invest more
in an advertising approach that is per-ad slightly less
effective but also per-ad signiﬁcantly less expensive.18
• To what extent can privacy-preserving technologies
replace current uses of tracking? A number of designs
have been advanced that, while not perfect substitutes,
would enable much of the advertising functionality that
tracking supports (see Section VIII-A). Limitations on
tracking could incentivize advertising companies to de-
velop and implement privacy-preserving technologies.
• What proportion of users would consent to tracking
or pay if required to access a service? If diminished
tracking-based advertising does impact publishers, they
could require visitors to either pay or consent to track-
ing. Some proportion of users would choose either
option rather than forgo the service.
Given the public attention to third-party web tracking, there
is surprisingly scant research on these central issues.
A 2009 industry-sponsored paper by Beales [80] has been
widely cited (e.g. [50]) for the proposition that behavioral
targeting brings in substantially more value than other forms
of ad targeting. Beales’s study found that behaviorally tar-
geted advertising was roughly twice as expensive and twice
as effective as untargeted (“run of network”) advertising.
There are at least three problems with the methodology
used in the study. First,
the paper relies on data from
a small, unrepresentative sample of advertising networks.
Some statistics rely on data from fewer than ﬁve companies.
The participating companies self-selected and were aware
of the purpose of the study. Second, the paper compares
behavioral advertising to untargeted advertising. As noted
earlier, the relevant comparison is to the next-best alternative
17In economic terms: there are cross-demand elasticities between tracking
and non-tracking forms of advertising.
18Advertising auction mechanisms further complicate the inquiry, since
they limit the surplus that advertisers can capture from better ad targeting.
(e.g. contextual targeting). Third, the study concludes that
behavioral advertising brings value to publishers through
increased effectiveness and price. But, as noted earlier,
increased price decreases the marginal value of behavioral
advertising to advertisers.
Proponents of third-party web tracking have also fre-
quently cited a 2011 paper by Goldfarb and Tucker [81], [82]
reporting a 65% decrease in EU advertising effectiveness
after the 2002 ePrivacy Directive was transposed by member
states. We ﬁnd four ﬂaws in the Goldfarb and Tucker study.
First, the analysis relies exclusively on self-reported data
from one company’s surveys of web users. The paper does
not explain how the data was collected, let alone demonstrate
how it is valid and reliable. In fact, the survey data appears to
have a number of oddities. It suggests, for example, that after
the EU ePrivacy Directive non-EU advertising was twice as
effective on EU viewers as on non-EU viewers.
Second, the Goldfarb and Tucker data is not controlled
for types of ad targeting. Behavioral advertising may only
account for a slight share of the advertising in the study.
Third, the Goldfarb and Tucker study appears to incor-
rectly assume that the 2002 EU ePrivacy Directive signiﬁ-
cantly altered online advertising behavior in Europe. In fact,
advertising practices in the EU were largely unaffected by
the ePrivacy Directive (see Section IV-C).
Fourth, the study seems to overlook changes in the online
advertising market. Behavioral advertising was scarce in
2001 and a very small share of online advertising in 2008
[79]. The same time period yielded signiﬁcant advances in
contextual and demographic ad targeting. If the EU law
negatively affected behavioral advertising, we should expect
an across-the-board performance lift for EU and non-EU ads,
with a slightly greater rise in non-EU performance. Instead,
the authors predict and demonstrate a signiﬁcant decrease in
EU performance and near-constant non-EU performance.
A ﬁnal study, by Yan et al. [83], has been widely
miscited by supporters of third-party tracking. In that paper,
the authors persuasively demonstrate that ideal behavioral
targeting could substantially improve the effectiveness of
ﬁrst-party advertising on the Bing search engine. The paper
does not examine behavioral advertising in practice or third-
party behavioral advertising.
THIRD-PARTY WEB TRACKING TECHNOLOGY
VII. TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES
While the debates surrounding web tracking tend to focus
on HTTP cookies, there are myriad stateful (“supercookie”)
and stateless (“ﬁngerprinting”) technologies that can be used
to pseudonymously correlate web activities.19
19A note on jargon: when a non-cookie tracking technology is used to
recreate a deleted tracking cookie, it is dubbed a “zombie cookie.”

A. Stateful Tracking (“Supercookies”)
A website can encode a globally unique pseudonymous
device identiﬁer into any stateful web technology so long
as it persists at least log2n bits, where n is the number
of Internet-connected devices (presently roughly 5 billion,
requiring 33 bits). Table III(a) provides a list of commonly
deployed stateful web technologies and notes which have
been observed in use for third-party web tracking. The
evercookie library [92] provides a reference implementation
for many of these tracking techniques.
Soltani et al. [14], McDonald and Cranor [93], and
Ayenson et al. [8] report extensive use of Flash storage
by popular websites, and Ayenson et al. found some use
HTML5 local storage.
A number of online advertising companies,
including
ClearSpring, Interclick, Speciﬁc Media, and Quantcast, have
been discovered using Flash cookies to track users. In mid-
2011 Soltani [9] found that a third-party analytics service,
421
KISSmetrics, was using cookies, Flash cookies, ETag cook-
ies, cache cookies, userData, and HTML5 local storage,
and that the non-cookie tracking technologies were used to
recreate a cookie if deleted. We discovered that Microsoft
was using an ETag cookie and a cache cookie in connection
with its script for syncing an advertising identiﬁer across
web properties [94].
B. Stateless Tracking (“Fingerprinting”)
A website may be able to learn properties about
the
browser that, taken together, form a unique or nearly unique
identiﬁer [95], [96]. Some properties require active discovery
through a script or plug-in (Table III(b)). Other properties
can be passively learned from network trafﬁc (Table III(c)).
In a 2010 sample of nearly 500,000 browsers Eckersley
reported 83.6% were uniquely identiﬁed with a subset of
active ﬁngerprinting features. 94.2% of browsers with Flash
or Java enabled were uniquely identiﬁed. While ﬁngerprints
changed quickly, a simple matching algorithm was able to
associate new and old ﬁngerprints with over 99% precision.
including 41st Parameter/AdTruth,
BlueCava, and iovation, advertise commercial browser ﬁn-
gerprinting technology.

Passive ﬁngerprinting is particularly problematic since it
cannot be detected with web measurement. Further research
is needed to understand how effective passive ﬁngerprinting
is and what steps websites can take to scrub passive ﬁnger-
printing data from their logs. A recent study of Hotmail and
Bing users by Yen et al. [97] suggests passive ﬁngerprinting
may be sufﬁcient to track many stationary browsers.
VIII. PRIVACY-PRESERVING THIRD-PARTY SERVICES
There have been several efforts at designing third-party
services that would capture the economic value of particular
uses of tracking while preserving user privacy. Current
proposals are based on a narrow subset of business models;
further work is needed to support privacy across the range
of evolving third-party website business models (Section V).
A. Behavioral Advertising
Privad [98] is designed to conceal a user’s activities from
an advertising network by interposing an anonymizing proxy
between the browser and the ad network. In this approach,
trusted client software subscribes to streams of possibly
relevant ads, selects relevant ads locally, submits candidates
for auction, and then reports results. While the Privad model
is designed to offer comprehensive privacy guarantees, it
requires broad adoption of high-performance anonymizing
proxies. This seems unlikely in the near future.
In an extension to Privad [99], Reznichenko et al. eval-
uate designs for privacy-preserving advertising auctions.
The work emphasizes the trade-off between an advertising
company’s ability to conceal its ranking algorithm and bids
and a user’s ability to prevent pseudonymous tracking.

Like Privad, Adnostic [100] uses client-based function-
ality to perform ad selection, but it eliminates anonymizing
proxies at the cost of less precise ad targeting. Adnostic also
simpliﬁes cost-per-click billing by allowing the advertising
network to learn of a user’s ad clicks. Cost-per-impression
billing would still require a low-performance trusted inter-
mediary so as to not reveal the user’s ad impressions. As
implemented, Adnostic requires a browser extension, which
is a practical barrier to more widespread adoption.
RePriv [101], by Fredrikson and Livshits, is a veriﬁable
policy architecture that enables users to selectively grant
permission for generating and sharing client-side data stores
that enable website personalization. The RePriv model holds
promise as a general-purpose platform for building privacy-
preserving advertising like Privad and Adnostic. But, like
Adnostic, RePriv would have to be translated from its current
implementation as a single-platform browser extension into
existing web technologies for near-term deployment.
Bilenko and Richardson [102] propose an approach for
keyword-based search advertising that provides privacy
against a weaker threat model. The search advertising com-
pany is trusted to temporarily compute on user proﬁle data,
but then store the data in the browser and delete its copy. The
authors ran their algorithm against 60 days of Bing search
advertising logs and achieved almost all the beneﬁt of cur-
rent server-side behavioral targeting. Speciﬁcally, they report
capturing over 95% of the increase in click-through rates,
generating approximately 4% greater revenue than search
advertising without behavioral targeting. We are skeptical
that the temporary data-use model is likely to be adopted;
web services in general, and online advertising companies in
particular, have historically been loath to voluntarily discard
logs. The model also introduces the risk of inadvertent or
surreptitious collection of third-party tracking data.
B. Analytics
Some analytics services have taken technical and legal
precautions to silo tracking data for each ﬁrst-party website.
Several free and paid services, including Google Analyt-
ics and Adobe SiteCatalyst (formerly Omniture), use the
same-origin policy to restrict the scope of pseudonymous
identiﬁers to a ﬁrst-party website. Google uses a ﬁrst-party
cookie to achieve this; Adobe offers the choice of a cookie
scoped to a ﬁrst-party subdomain CNAMEd to Adobe (e.g.
metrics.apple.com) or a cookie scoped to a unique
Adobe subdomain (e.g. paypal.112.2o7.net).
Google Analytics offers an opt-in feature to websites
that prevents logging the last octet of a user’s IP address
(anonymizeIp).20 This privacy option does not seem to
reduce the beneﬁt of the service since Google Analytics does
not report IP addresses, and geolocation (the only reported
measurement that relies on IP addresses) is unlikely to vary
20It is unclear how much privacy is afforded by this measure [97].
much by the last octet. We nonetheless found barely any
use of the option: in an August 2011 crawl of the Alexa top
10,000 global websites, anonymizeIp was set on only 63
of 4861 (1.3%) reports to Google Analytics.
Paid analytics services usually promise by contract to
make no use of the data they collect except as directed
by their clients, and they impose internal business controls
to ensure each client’s data remains segregated. Adobe, for
example, makes these guarantees [103]: “Although the data
generated by Adobe’s products resides on Adobe’s servers,
each customer owns the data generated by the use of its
site. By contract, Adobe has no right to access or use this
data. In addition, Adobe does not allow use of the data for
any purpose other than those of the owner (web publisher);
that is, Adobe silos each customer’s data for use by that
customer.”
IX. USER CHOICE MECHANISMS
Three technical solutions have been advanced for giving
users control over third-party web tracking: opt-out cookies,
blocking, and Do Not Track.
A. Opt-Out Cookies and the AdChoices Icon
User choice in current online advertising self-regulation is
implemented with opt-out cookies. There are several prob-
lems with this approach. First, it requires manual updating.
To opt out of new third parties, a user has to install new
cookies. Second, cookies expire, so a user has to periodically
renew opt-out cookies. Third, users may clear their cookies,
inadvertently removing their opt-out preferences. Fourth,
opt-out cookies are fragile;
is easy for a third party
to improperly set or delete an opt-out cookie. Fifth, opt-
out cookies scale poorly; each third-party PS+1 requires a
network roundtrip, resulting in a sluggish user experience
when changing many preferences. Browser extensions for
persisting opt-out cookies, such as TACO or Google Keep
