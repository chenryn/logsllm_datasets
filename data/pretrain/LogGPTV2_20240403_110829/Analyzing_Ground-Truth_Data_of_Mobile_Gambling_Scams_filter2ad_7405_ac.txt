### Driven (41.2%)
The term "Driven" (41.2%) refers to a scenario where the victim proactively requests a gambling app after being enticed by scammers. For example, scammers may continuously discuss and showcase their gambling profits in group channels or on social media, leading victims to believe that the app is profitable. 

**Example:**
ID-192 reported:
"The scammer invited me into a group channel. In this channel, I observed how the gambling tutor taught us to gamble, and how group members placed bets and won. They claimed they all made successful payouts. The scammer then mentioned that winning in a new lottery app was very easy. I saw that other group members expressed their intention to participate. Consequently, I could not wait any longer and proactively contacted the scammer to download the gambling scam app."

Interestingly, when comparing scam losses between Scammer-Driven and Victim-Driven cases, we found that Victim-Driven cases resulted in significantly higher losses. The average scam loss for Scammer-Driven cases was $30,648.8 (median: $11,938.0), while for Victim-Driven cases, it was $47,302.7 (median: $20,045.9). This difference suggests that social engineering tactics, which lure victims into proactively requesting scam gambling apps, are more effective in defrauding them.

**Finding III:**
Social engineering tricks that entice victims to proactively request scam gambling apps are more effective in tricking victims out of money.

### Deposits
After delivering the scam gambling app, scammers use various strategies to enforce victims to deposit money continually. These strategies can be categorized into two sub-types: "Incentive" and "Pressure." In the "Incentive" strategy (44.2%), scammers offer incentives for continuous deposits. For instance, they may promise additional bonuses or rewards for larger deposits.

Although scammers prefer using incentives (44.2% vs. 11.0%), both strategies have similar success rates. We define the success rate as the number of victims who made deposits following social engineering tricks, divided by the total number of cases coded as "Incentive" or "Pressure." Our observations show that both strategies have nearly identical success rates, with about half of the victims making deposits. The "Incentive" strategy has a success rate of 47.1%, while the "Pressure" strategy has a 48.1% success rate.

**Finding IV:**
To ensure victims make deposits, scammers tend to leverage incentive strategies rather than imposing psychological pressures, even though both strategies achieve similar success rates.

### Scamming Logic
All incident reports in our study involve cash-out scams, where scammers prevent victims from withdrawing their gambling winnings. We categorize the scamming logic into two sub-types: "Disable App Functionality" and "Modify Account." Most scammers disable the functionality of the scam app, freezing victims' accounts or disabling the cash-out feature. Additionally, 22 scammers directly wiped out the victims' balances, which we coded as "Modify Account."

In some cases, scammers create excuses to delay the victims' awareness. For example, ID-138 described:
"... One day, the gambling tutor sent me a message: 'The company’s manager has been arrested for illegally opening an enterprise account, and his communication account has been taken down. Please do not contact the manager or tutor in the short term. Your gambling account balance will be refunded in one month. Don’t contact us, or you will be at your own risk.' At the end of the month, I found that I did not receive any payout, and I couldn't open the gambling app either. Only then did I realize I had been cheated and turned to the police."

**Finding V:**
Unlike traditional online gambling frauds, which often charge additional fees or sell bet-cheating software, the scamming logic in our study primarily involves disabling the functionalities of scam apps.

### Discussion
Some of the social engineering tricks used to establish connections with victims have also been discussed in other fraud research, such as connecting victims as an authority or intimate in "419 scams" [20] and online dating fraud [21]. Our study presents the first systematic analysis based on a unique and valuable dataset of scam incident reports, involving a larger number of victims over a longer time span compared to previous work. Our findings reveal that mobile gambling scammers contact victims for diverse reasons (e.g., house renting and job hunting) through various platforms (e.g., local forums and online Q&A platforms). Additionally, our research highlights the social engineering tricks used to deliver scam gambling apps, enforce deposits, and execute the scamming logic. While high-level psychological tricks like showing incentives or pressure have been mentioned in previous studies [22], [23], those studies did not focus on gambling-specific tactics.

### Gambling Scam App Analysis
In this section, we analyze the behavior of scam gambling apps, including their development frameworks, permissions, compatibility, and network infrastructure.

#### Genuine Gambling Apps
We collected a set of genuine gambling apps for comparison. These refer to reputable and legitimate gambling apps. We fetched popular gambling websites from SimilarWeb [27], filtered top-ranked sites based on the Tranco Top-1M Ranking List [28], and validated these websites and associated apps through certificates and VirusTotal labels. We also checked if the apps were published on Google Play or the App Store. We confirmed 156 websites and downloaded 182 genuine Android gambling apps and 134 genuine iOS gambling apps.

#### Public and Non-public Apps
We analyzed whether the scam apps in our study were available to the public. As of January 4, 2021, none of the iOS scam apps in our dataset were indexed in the App Store. For Android apps, we extracted package names from APK files and searched for them in Google Play, Androzoo, and other third-party app markets. None of the package names matched successfully in these markets; only five scam apps with the same package name were found in iuuu9 and anxz, with innocent-looking descriptions and screenshots. When launched, these apps redirected users to a scam gateway to download the scam app.

**Apps Sideloading:**
None of the gambling scam apps in our dataset are available in reputable app markets. However, scammers provide step-by-step tutorials for sideloading apps, requiring only 4-5 clicks. Some scammers also provide detailed technical support for sideloading. Note that scam apps leverage the Apple Developer Enterprise Program to distribute gambling scam apps on iOS, bypassing the need for jailbreaking. We have reported these abuses to the owners of the enterprise certificates and to Apple.

**Finding VI:**
None of the gambling scam apps in our dataset can be found in reputable app markets. Instead, scammers launch attacks with sideloaded apps, providing step-by-step instructions and technical support.

#### Development Framework Identification
We investigated the development frameworks used by scammers to generate scam apps. We identified eight development frameworks, including React Native, DCloud, Cocos2dx, Unity3D, Cordova, and APICloud. Interestingly, scammers abused Online App Generators (OAGs) like DCloud and APICloud to generate and sign scam apps. We found that 63 Android apps and seven iOS apps in our study were generated by DCloud and APICloud, accounting for 4.7% of the scam gambling apps. Additionally, 137 scam apps were signed by Digital Heaven, the company behind DCloud. We have reported this issue to DCloud.

**Finding VII:**
Scammers abuse Online App Generators (OAGs) to automatically generate and sign scam apps.

#### Scam App Clustering
We conducted a clustering analysis of gambling apps based on file structure similarity and code similarity. For file similarity, we calculated the Jaccard distance of resource files. For code similarity, we used DBSCAN, a density-based clustering algorithm, on the similarity matrix. We clustered 1,068 Android gambling apps and 419 iOS gambling apps into 134 and 11 groups, respectively. For Android apps, 49 groups had sizes larger than one, while for iOS apps, six groups had sizes larger than one.
