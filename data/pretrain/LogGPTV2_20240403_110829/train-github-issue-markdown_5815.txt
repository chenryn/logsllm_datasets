When the type of TextField is set to number and give it a initial value, once
the entered number is deleted, the displayed value becomes 0. If you then
enter another number, the zero will stay unless the page is refreshed.
I've checked the value received in the onChange function, which doesn't come
with the leading zero.  
If the 'value' attribute is not set, this issue won't occur.

## Expected Behavior
If the entered number is deleted, it'd be better to not show the default 0 (as
seen in Component Demos).  
OR  
Show the default 0, but remove it if the first digit entered is not 0.
## Current Behavior
The leading zero won't go away.
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
  1. Use a TextField and set type to number. Apply an onChange function.
  2. In the browser, enter a number in the field, and remove it. You should see a zero now.
  3. Enter another number. You shoud now see a the number with a leading zero.

## Context
This behaviour is okay if the field is used for mobile number.  
In the case where it's used for currency or quantity, it could be a bit
confusing.
