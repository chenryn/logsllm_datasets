It seems like you are encountering an error while using the `sns.palplot` function with `sns.diverging_palette` in a Python environment. The error message suggests that there is a type mismatch, specifically with a float value being used where an integer is expected. Here is a more polished and detailed version of your issue:

I am attempting to use Seaborn in a standard Python shell environment, but I consistently encounter an error when using the `palplot` function with `diverging_palette`. The code snippet causing the error is as follows:

```python
import seaborn as sns
sns.palplot(sns.diverging_palette(240, 10, n=9))
```

The error traceback is as follows:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\Users\meyringer\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37-32\lib\site-packages\numpy\core\function_base.py", line 117, in linspace
    num = operator.index(num)
TypeError: 'float' object cannot be interpreted as an integer

During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:

    .format(type(num)))
TypeError: object of type <class 'float'> cannot be safely interpreted as an integer.
```

Do you have any ideas about what might be causing this issue?

### Possible Causes and Solutions

1. **Version Compatibility**: Ensure that you are using compatible versions of Seaborn and NumPy. Sometimes, specific versions of libraries may have bugs or compatibility issues. You can check the versions using:
   ```python
   import seaborn as sns
   import numpy as np
   print(sns.__version__)
   print(np.__version__)
   ```

2. **Environment Issues**: Ensure that your Python environment is set up correctly and that all dependencies are installed properly. You can try creating a new virtual environment and installing the necessary packages:
   ```sh
   python -m venv myenv
   source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `myenv\Scripts\activate`
   pip install seaborn numpy matplotlib
   ```

3. **Code Issue**: The error suggests that a float value is being passed where an integer is expected. This could be due to a bug in the library or an unexpected value. Try specifying `n` as an integer explicitly:
   ```python
   sns.palplot(sns.diverging_palette(240, 10, n=int(9)))
   ```

If the problem persists, consider reporting the issue on the Seaborn GitHub repository, providing the full traceback and details of your environment.
