For .NET debugging, we currently need to have the user manually create a
tasks.json in order to support build. We would like to find some solution to
avoid the user needing to do this manually.
A few options:
  1. Support simple shell commands directly inside of launch.json. So if all the user wants to do is execute a command with a default error syntax they don't need this extra file. Example:  
"preLaunchCommand": "dotnet compile"  
Which would execute 'dotnet compile' in the workspace directory.

  2. Support auto-generating a tasks.json when creating launch.json. This way we can give them a good default value of it and the user doesn't need to manually enter it.  
-or-
  3. Support defining tasks in an extension's package.json. So the user only needs to create a launch.json if they want to do something weird.
