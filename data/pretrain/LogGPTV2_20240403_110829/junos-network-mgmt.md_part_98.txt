To configure local port mirroring of employee-to-web traffic from the two ports connected to employee
computers:
1. Configure the output interface:
[edit interfaces]
user@switch# set xe-0/0/47 unit 0 family ethernet-switching
1223
2. Configure the employee-web-monitor output interface. (Configure only the output—the input comes from
the filter.)
[edit forwarding-options]
user@switch# set port-mirroring instance employee–web–monitor family ethernet-switching
output interface xe-0/0/47.0
3. Configure a firewall filter called watch-employee that includes a term to match traffic sent to the Web
and send it to the port-mirroring instance employee-web-monitor. Traffic to and from the corporate
subnet (destination or source address of 192.0.2.16/28) does not need to be copied, so create another
term to accept that traffic before it reaches the term that sends Web traffic to the instance:
[edit firewall family ethernet-switching]
user@switch# set filter watch-employee term employee-to-corp from ip-destination-address
192.0.2.16/28
user@switch# set filter watch-employee term employee-to-corp from ip-source-address
192.0.2.16/28
user@switch# set filter watch-employee term employee-to-corp then accept
user@switch# set filter watch-employee term employee-to-web from destination-port 80
user@switch# set filter watch-employee term employee-to-web then port-mirror-instance
employee-web-monitor
4. Apply the firewall filter to the appropriate interfaces as an ingress filter (egress filters do not allow
analyzers):
[edit interfaces]
user@switch# set xe-0/0/0 unit 0 family ethernet-switching filter input watch-employee
user@switch# set xe-0/0/6 unit 0 family ethernet-switching filter input watch-employee
Results
Check the results of the configuration:
[edit]
user@switch# show
forwarding-options {
port-mirroring {
instance {
1224
employee-web-monitor {
family ethernet-switching {
output {

}
then accept;
term employee-to-web {

}
then port-mirror-instance employee-web-monitor;

Verifying That the Analyzer Has Been Correctly Created
Purpose
Verify that the port-mirroring instance named employee-web-monitor has been created on the switch with
the appropriate input interfaces and appropriate output interface.
Action
You can verify that the port mirror port-mirroring instance has been configured as expected by using the
show forwarding-options port-mirroring command.
user@switch> show forwarding-options port-mirroring
Instance name : employee-web-monitor
Instance Id: 2
Input parameters:
Rate :1
Run-length :0
Maximum packet length :0
Output parameters:
Family State Destination Next-hop
1226
ethernet-switching up xe-0/0/47.0
Meaning
This output shows the following information about the port-mirroring instance employee-web-monitor:
• Has a rate of 1 (mirroring every packet, the default setting)
• The number of consecutive packets sampled (run-length) is 0
• The maximum size of the original packet that was mirrored is 0 (0 indicates the entire packet)
• The state of the output parameters: up indicates that the instance is mirroring the traffic entering the
xe-0/0/0 and xe-0/0/6 interfaces, and is sending the mirrored traffic to the xe-0/0/47 interface
If the state of the output interface is down or if the output interface is not configured, the state value will
be down and the instance will not be programmed for mirroring.

Mirroring All Employee Traffic for Remote Analysis | 1227
Mirroring Employee-to-Web Traffic for Remote Analysis | 1229
Verification | 1233
Use port mirroring to send traffic to applications that analyze traffic for purposes such as monitoring
compliance, enforcing policies, detecting intrusions, monitoring and predicting traffic patterns,
correlating events, and so on. Port mirroring copies packets entering or exiting an interface or entering a
VLAN and sends the copies either to a local interface for local monitoring or to a VLAN for remote
monitoring. This example describes how to configure port mirroring for remote analysis.
Requirements
This example uses the following hardware and software components:
• Junos OS Release 13.2 for the QFX Series
1227
• A switch
Overview and Topology
IN THIS SECTION
Topology | 1227
This topic includes two related examples that describe how to mirror traffic entering ports on the switch
to an analyzer VLAN so that you can perform analysis using a remote device. The first example shows
how to mirror all traffic sent by employee computers to the switch. The second example includes a filter
to mirror only the employee traffic going to the Web.
Topology
In this example:
• Interfaces ge-0/0/0 and ge-0/0/1 are Layer 2 interfaces that connect to employee computers.
• Interface ge-0/0/2 is a Layer 2 interface that connects to another switch.
• VLAN remote-analyzer is configured on all switches in the topology to carry the mirrored traffic.
NOTE: In addition to performing the configuration steps described here, you must also configure
the analyzer VLAN (remote-analyzer in this example) on the other switches that are used to
connect the source switch (the one in this configuration) to the one that the monitoring station is
connected to.

user@switch# set vlans remote-analyzer vlan-id 999
2. Configure the interface connected to another switch for trunk mode and associate it with the remote-
analyzer VLAN:
[edit interfaces]
user@switch# set ge-0/0/10 unit 0 family ethernet-switching port-mode trunk
user@switch# set ge-0/0/10 unit 0 family ethernet-switching vlan members 999
3. Configure the employee-monitor analyzer:
[edit forwarding-options]
user@switch# set analyzer employee–monitor
user@switch# set analyzer employee-monitor input ingress interface ge-0/0/0.0
1229
user@switch# set analyzer employee-monitor input ingress interface ge-0/0/1.0
user@switch# set analyzer employee-monitor output vlan remote-analyzer
4. Configure the remote-analyzer VLAN on the switches that connect this switch to the monitoring
workstation.

Verifying That the Analyzer Has Been Correctly Created
Purpose
Verify that the analyzer named employee-monitor or employee-web-monitor has been created on the switch with
the appropriate input interfaces and appropriate output interface.
Action
You can verify the port mirror analyzer is configured as expected using the show analyzer command.

What Is 1:N Port Mirroring?
We use the term 1:N port mirroring in this document to refer to the feature that enables you to mirror
packets to multiple destinations. "1" represents the packet source being mirrored and "N" represents the
multiple destinations the packet is sent to. You might also see this feature described as multipacket
mirroring.
Port mirroring helps network administrators to debug network problems and to fend off attacks on the
network. You can use port mirroring for traffic analysis on network devices such as routers and switches
that, unlike hubs, do not broadcast packets to every interface on the destination device. Port mirroring
sends copies of all packets to local or remote analyzers where you can monitor and analyze the data.
1235
You use 1:N port mirroring to mirror traffic to multiple Layer 2 destinations. You use next-hop groups in
this feature configuration.
You configure these multiple observing ports with connections to different monitoring devices.
Getting Ready to Configure 1:N Port Mirroring—Guidelines and Limitations
You can configure the 1:N port mirroring feature in the following two configuration methods:
