# Attacks on Medical Devices: A Comprehensive Analysis

## Overview
The techniques we have demonstrated require minimal skill to execute, relying on basic security concepts, open-source reconnaissance, and publicly disclosed vulnerabilities.

## Adversaries of Concern
- **Terrorists/Extremists**: Particularly technically adept and active groups like ISIS.
- **Nation-State Actors**: State-sponsored adversaries.
- **Patients Themselves**: There have been instances where patients downloaded documentation, retrieved service technician login credentials, and altered infusion pump dosages. For example, [this 2012 incident in Austria](http://austriantimes.at/news/General_News/2012-12-01/45780/Patient_hackers_managed_to_dial_a_drug_in_hospital).

## Adversary Attack Model
- **Greatest Risk**: A combined attack, such as a major event (e.g., the Boston Marathon bombing or 9/11) in conjunction with an attack on the healthcare system or critical infrastructure.
- **Government Perspective**: The U.S. government considers this a significant risk, and it is advisable to heed their warnings. For more information, see the [CyberCity training program](http://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/cybercity-allows-government-hackers-to-train-for-attacks/2012/11/26/588f4dae-1244-11e2-be82-c3411b7680a9_story.html).

## Detecting and Proving Attacks
- **Challenges in Detection**:
  - **Closed Source Code**
  - **Specialized Diagnostic Equipment and Proprietary Protocols**
  - **Lack of Forensic Capabilities**: Only two medical device forensic experts are listed on LinkedIn, one from the FDA and one retired from the FBI.
  - **FDA's Role**: The FDA only adjudicates devices for generic "malfunction" and lacks specific protocols for cyber attacks.
  - **Evidence and Audit Trails**: Without proper evidence or audit logs, proving an attack or adverse event is extremely difficult.

## Regulatory Protections
- **HIPAA**: Focuses on patient data privacy but does not address medical device security or adversary resilience testing and mitigation.
- **Regulatory Agencies (FDA, DHS, FBI, HHS)**: While these agencies issue advisories, the responsibility for securing medical devices lies with the healthcare organizations themselves. Relevant advisories include:
  - ICS-ALERT-13-164-01
  - FDA UCM356423
  - FBI PIN # 140408-009

## Causes of Security Issues in Healthcare
- **HIPAA-Driven Information Security Programs**: These programs often focus on compliance rather than effective security measures.
- **Check-Box Security**: Ineffective against adversarial threats.
- **Policy Limitations**: Policies do not prevent adversarial risks.

## Manufacturer-Side Issues
- **Historical Focus on Compliance**: Manufacturers have traditionally focused on regulatory compliance and are just beginning to build information security teams.
- **Lack of Collaboration**: Many manufacturers have not fully embraced partnerships with security researchers.
- **Patching and Updating Constraints**: Some manufacturers are restricted from patching or updating systems, and hard-coded admin accounts cannot be changed. For more details, see [FDA guidance](http://www.fda.gov/medicaldevices/deviceregulationandguidance/guidancedocuments/ucm077812.htm).

## Patching and Anti-Virus Challenges
- **Patching Risks**: Complex ecosystems, leased or third-party managed devices, and potential liability issues make patching a challenging task.
- **Anti-Virus Incidents**: Several reports, including the McAfee DAT 5958 incident, highlight the negative impact of anti-virus software on medical devices. For more information, see [this report](http://hosted.verticalresponse.com/250140/86af97f052/).

## Solutions and Recommendations
- **External Attack Surface Reduction and Hardening**
- **Shodan Monitoring**: Continual monitoring using tools like Shodan, Masscan, and ZMAP.
- **Metasploit Testing**: Ensure your external perimeter is Metasploit-proof.
- **Stop the Bleeding**: Remove SMB services.
- **Adversarial Resilience Testing**: Implement red teaming and harden edge devices to applicable NIST standards.

## Needs from the Healthcare Industry
- **Internal Security Programs**: Focus on medical device security, including regular testing.
- **Vendor Selection and Procurement**: Require security testing during vendor selection.
- **MDS2 Forms**: Request MDS2 forms from vendors and incorporate penalties for non-compliance into contracts.
- **Vulnerability Disclosure**: Responsibly disclose findings to manufacturers, FDA, DHS/ICS-CERT, and other relevant bodies.
- **Demand Remediation**: Incorporate vulnerability remediation and indemnification clauses into contracts.

## Recommended Disclosure Reporting
- **Individual Researchers**: Report to DHS/ICS-CERT, FDA, and the manufacturer. Use CVE and OSVDB if appropriate.
- **Healthcare Organizations**: Report to the manufacturer, DHS/ICS-CERT, FDA, and use CVE and OSVDB if appropriate.

## Accessibility of Medical Devices
- **Challenges**: Many devices are prescription-only and expensive.
- **Research Options**: Purchase end-of-life or recalled devices from eBay or MEDWOW, or hack your own device under NDA.
- **Service Manuals**: Use search engines to locate detailed manuals containing systems, operations, and architecture information.

## Case Study: Defibrillators
- **Public IP Space**: Zoll X Series defibrillators were found on public IP space.
- **Web Interface Certificate**: Available on the landing page.
- **Wireless and Bluetooth Interfaces**: Provide direct access to the communications processor via UART interface.
- **Configuration File**: Import configuration using a USB file named ZollConfig.xml.
- **Security Flaws**: Default logins, supervisor modes, and log clearing capabilities pose significant security risks.
- **Other Product Lines**: Similar security issues exist in other Zoll defibrillator models, such as the M Series, R Series, E Series, and X Series.

## Vendor Changes
- **Increased Engagement**: Vendors are starting to engage with security researchers.
- **Owlet Baby Care**: Actively collaborating with researchers to test device security before market release.
- **Philips Healthcare**: Released a responsible disclosure policy, emphasizing transparency, accountability, and responsiveness.

## How to Help
- **Collaboration Opportunities**: Seeking Android/iOS security researchers, physicians, and patients to collaborate on healthcare application security.
