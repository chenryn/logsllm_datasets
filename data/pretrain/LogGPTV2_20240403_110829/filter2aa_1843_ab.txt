An Attack On Medical Devices 
– Everything We Just Showed You Requires Little Skill To 
Execute.  Basic Security Concepts. Open Source 
Reconnaissance & Publicly Disclosed Vulnerabilities. 
40 
Adversaries We Should Worry About 
• Terrorists/Extremists  
– Especially Technically Adept & Active Adversaries Like ISIS. 
• Nation State  
– State Sponsored Actors 
• Patients Themselves 
– Patients Downloaded Documentation, Retrieved Service 
Technician Login And Changed Infusion Pump Dosage

01/45780/Patient_hackers_managed_to_dial_a_drug_in_hospital 
41 
Adversary Attack Model  
• Greatest Risk Is A Combined Attack 
– Event Such As Boston Marathon Bombing Or 9/11 In 
Conjunction With Attacking Healthcare System Or Power 
Plant, etc.. 
• Really Is That A Risk? 
– Our Government Thinks So.  You Probably Should Listen. 
• CyberCity – Ed Skoudis/Counter Hack

c3411b7680a9_story.html 
42 
Has An Attack Already Happened? 
• How Would You Know If A Medical Device Was 
Hacked? 
– Closed Source Code 
– Specialized Diagnostic Equipment, Proprietary Protocols 
• Lack Of Forensic Capabilities In Medical Devices 
– Lack Of Medical Device Forensic Experts  
– Only 2 On Linked-In, FDA & Ret. FBI 
– FDA  Only  Adjudicates  Devices  For  Generic  “Malfunction” 
• How Do You Prove An Attack Or Adverse Event  
Without Evidence Or Audit Log Trail? 
43 
Doesn’t  HIPAA  Protect  Us?   
It Must Be Ineffective 
• Yes  I  Get  These  Emails  As  Well!!  I  Won’t  
Argue The Ineffectiveness!! 
• HIPAA Focuses On Privacy Of Patient Data 
• HIPAA Does Not Focus On Medical Device 
Security  
• HIPAA Does Not Focus On Adversary 
Resilience Testing And Mitigation 
44 
Doesn’t  FDA,  DHS,  FBI,  HHS,  etc..  
Protect Us? 
• No.    It’s  Your  Responsibility  To  Secure  Your  
Environment.   
• They Have Told You With Recent Advisories 
To Start Testing These Devices And 
Assessing Risk.  
• ICS-ALERT-13-164-01 
• FDA UCM356423 
• FBI PIN # 140408-009 
45 
What Caused These Issues In Healthcare? 
• HIPAA Drives Information Security Program & 
Budget 
• Security Is Not Compliance/Information 
Assurance 
• Check Box Security Is Not Effective 
• Policy Does Not Prevent Adversarial Risks 
46 
What Caused Issues In Manufacturers? 
• Never Had To Design For Adversarial 
Threats  
• Just Starting To Build Information Security 
Teams 
• Historically Focused On Regulatory 
Compliance Just Like Healthcare 
• Haven’t  Fully  Embraced  Partnering  With  
Security Researchers 
47 
Common Disconnects With Manufacturers 
• Been  Told  They  Can’t  Patch/Update  Systems 
– http://www.fda.gov/medicaldevices/deviceregulatio
nandguidance/guidancedocuments/ucm077812.ht
m 
• Been  Told  They  Can’t  Change  Hard-Coded 
Admin (Support) Accounts 
• Biomed – IS/Information Security Integration 
• Know  Your  Manufacturer’s  Information  
Security Employees – Maintain Relationship 48 
Patching Questions 
• Yes  You  Can…But  Should  You? 
• Complex Ecosystem Of Medical Devices 
– Leased, 3rd Party Managed, Multi-Vendor 
• What If Patch Breaks Medical Device Or 
Results In Patient Safety Issue? 
– Liability 
• Many Healthcare Organizations Reluctant To 
Patch Or Modify Medical Devices 
49 
Anti-Virus Questions 
• Several FDA MAUDE Reports Of Negative 
Impact 
• McAfee DAT 5958 on 21 April, 2010 
– Svschost.exe Flagged As Wecorl-A Resulted In 
Continuous Reboot Of Systems 
– 1/3rd Of Hospitals In Rhode Island Impacted 
• AV Deleted Fetal Monitor Logs (7 Hours)

Solutions & Recommendations 
• External Attack Surface Reduction & Hardening 
• Recognize & Mitigate Your Exposure To Tools Like 
Shodan  
– Shodan API = Automation 
– Needs Continual Monitoring, Roll Your Own  
– Other Fast Scanning Tools: Masscan, ZMAP 
• Make Your External Perimeter Metasploit Proof 
– Yes You Actually Have To Use Metasploit 
51 
Solutions & Recommendations 
• Stop The Bleeding  
– Remove SMB Services 
• Adversarial Resilience Testing  
– Red Teaming 
– Harden Edge Devices To Applicable NIST Standards 
52 
Needs From Healthcare Industry 
• Internal programs focused on medical device 
security to include device security testing 
• Require security testing during vendor 
selection and procurement process  
• Work to show organization you are 
supporting their mission and values 
53 
Needs From Healthcare Industry 
• Request MDS2 Forms From Vendors 
– Incorporate Into Contract With Penalties 
• Responsibly Disclose Findings To 
Manufacturer, FDA, DHS/ICS-CERT 
– Possibly HHS OCR, FBI, FTC 
• Demand Vulnerabilities Are Remediated 
– Incorporate Into Contract With Penalties 
– Incorporate Indemnification Clauses Into Contract 
54 
Recommended Disclosure Reporting 
• Individual Researchers 
– DHS/ICS-CERT 
– FDA 
– Manufacturer – If Possible 
– CVE, OSVDB If Appropriate  
• Healthcare Organizations  
– Manufacturer 
– DHS/ICS-CERT 
– FDA 
– CVE, OSVDB If Appropriate 
55 
Accessibility Of Medical Devices 
• Difficult To Get Hands On Medical Devices 
– Many Devices Are Rx Only 
– Many Devices Are Very Expensive 
• Independent Research Options  
– Ebay or MEDWOW (Can Be End-Of-Life, Recalled) 
– Hack Your Own Device   
• Consultant 
– Most Often End Up Under NDA 
– Starting To See Non-Identifiable Data Clauses 
56 
Do You Really Need The Medical Device? 
• Use Search Engines To Locate Service 
Manuals 
– Contain Detailed Systems & Operations 
Information 
– Contain Support Or Service Technician Login 
Information 
– Contain Detailed Architecture & Schematics
