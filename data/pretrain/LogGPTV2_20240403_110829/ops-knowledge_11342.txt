Subject: Troubleshooting Scheduled Python Script for File Transfer Using PSCP on Windows 2008 Server

Hello,

I am encountering an issue with a scheduled task on my Windows 2008 server and would appreciate any troubleshooting suggestions or alternative methods.

**Environment and Setup:**
- **Server:** Windows 2008
- **Task:** A Python script that uses `pscp` to log into a Linux box, checks for new files, and copies them to a local directory on the C: drive.
- **Script Logging:** I have implemented logging at key points using `logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)`.

**Script Execution:**
- **Command Construction:**
  ```python
  command = 'pscp -pw xxxx name@ip:/ c:\\local_dir'
  ```
- **Execution:**
  ```python
  subprocess.call(command)
  ```

**Issue:**
- **Manual Execution (Works):** When I run the script manually from the command line, it successfully logs into the Linux box, identifies new files, and downloads them to the local directory.
- **Scheduled Task (Fails):** When the same script is executed via the Task Scheduler, it logs into the Linux box but does not download any new files, even though they exist.

**Logs:**
- The script logs and the Linux box logs confirm that the script successfully logs into the Linux box. However, no files are downloaded when the script is run by the Task Scheduler.

**Additional Information:**
- The script runs under the same user account in both scenarios (manual and scheduled).

**Question:**
- Has anyone encountered a similar issue?
- Do you have any suggestions for troubleshooting or alternative methods?

**Note:**
- A similar issue was resolved by using UNC paths (e.g., `\\10.x.xx.xx\Folder\xxx`) instead of drive letter paths (e.g., `C:\Folder\xxx`) in the .bat and .py scripts. Could this be a potential solution?

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
