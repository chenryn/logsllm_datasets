**Issue Description:**
I am encountering an error when attempting to run a Flutter application on my real device using Android Studio. The application runs successfully when created as a standard Android project, but fails with the following error logs when created as a Flutter project.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Create a new Flutter application in Android Studio.
2. Attempt to run the application on a real device.
3. Observe the error logs.

**Error Logs:**

```

**Additional Information:**
- I can run the application without issues if I create it as a standard Android project in Android Studio.
- The error occurs specifically when creating and running a Flutter project.

**Possible Causes:**
- The Android SDK directory (C:\Program Files (x86)\Android\android-sdk) is not writable, which prevents the installation of the required SDK components.

**Next Steps:**
- Ensure that the Android SDK directory has the necessary write permissions.
- Consider running Android Studio as an administrator.
- Verify the Gradle project setup in the `android/` folder.

If you have any further suggestions or need additional information, please let me know.
