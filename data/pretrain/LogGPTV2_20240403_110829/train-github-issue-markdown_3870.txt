##### System information (version)
  * OpenCV => 4.2
  * Operating System / Platform => Fedora Rawhide
  * Compiler => GCC 10
##### Detailed description
opencv fails to build with vtk 9.0. First issue is that VTK 9 no longer sets
VTK_RENDERING_BACKEND. This at least can worked around by passing that option
to cmake.
