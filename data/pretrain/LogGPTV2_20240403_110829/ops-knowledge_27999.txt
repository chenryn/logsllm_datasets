User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Unauthorized SSH coming from my linux server My ISP has contacted me stating that unauthorized attacks are coming from my LAMP server. Here is part of the log they have attached:

15:26:16.821245 IP My.Ip.is.here.59987 &gt; some.one.elses.ip.ssh: UDP, length 1
15:26:16.821248 IP My.Ip.is.here.59987 &gt; some.one.elses.ip.ssh: UDP, length 1
15:26:16.821251 IP My.Ip.is.here.59987 &gt; some.one.elses.ip.ssh: UDP, length 1
15:26:16.821253 IP My.Ip.is.here.59987 &gt; some.one.elses.ip.ssh: UDP, length 1 


How do I investigate this?

Assistant: First, either shut down or disconnect your server from the network. That will stop any attacks that are still in progress. It's very likely that your server is compromised. You'll need to do a full re-install and restore from a known-good backup. Yes, that's a pain, but it's the only foolproof way to ensure that you're restoring "clean" files. Before doing that, either swap out the hard drives of the server or take an image of them. That will let you do some forensic work to figure out what happens.

Once the new server is up, it goes without saying that you'll need to ensure that all passwords are changed to something long and complex or preferrably, just disable password auth and use key auth instead.
