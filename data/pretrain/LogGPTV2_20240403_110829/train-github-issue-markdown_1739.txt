## Steps to Reproduce

1. Run the Flutter application with the following command:
   ```sh
   flutter run --preview-dart-2
   ```

2. Make a minor change to `widget_inspector.dart` or any other file within the `package:flutter` directory.

3. Trigger a hot reload in the running application.

4. Observe the warning message that appears:
   ```
   Some program elements were changed during reload but did not run when the view was reassembled;
   you may need to restart the app (by pressing "R") for the changes to have an effect.
   • _RenderSliverPersistentHeaderForWidgetsMixin.handleEvent (package:flutter/src/widgets/sliver_persistent_header.dart:253)
   • #errors (file:///)
   • #errors (file:///)
   • _RenderSliverPinnedPersistentHeader.handleEvent (package:flutter/src/widgets/sliver_persistent_header.dart:309)
   ```

This warning indicates that some of the changes made during the hot reload did not take effect, and a full restart of the application is required to apply the changes.
