When using _document.js, a style tag will render `>` as `&gt;`. This prevents
selectors like `.foo > .bar { ... }` from working.
  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
when defining a style tag in _document such as
it should preserve the `>`
## Current Behavior
The `>` gets encoded as `&gt;`
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
Using the hello-world example in examples/ as a basis
  1. add a _document.js in pages that looks like
    import Document, { Head, Main, NextScript } from 'next/document'
    import flush from 'styled-jsx/server'
    export default class MyDocument extends Document {
      static getInitialProps({ renderPage }) {
        const { html, head, errorHtml, chunks } = renderPage()
        const styles = flush()
        return { html, head, errorHtml, chunks, styles }
      }
      render() {
        return (
              {this.props.customValue}
        )
      }
    }
  2. `next build && npm start`
  3. view the page source in the browser, `` is rendered.
## workaround
Using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` fixes the issue
     div { background-color: red }' }} />
## Context
I am attempting to change the css of divs that are outside of what a normal
nextjs page can access.

## Note
When using styled-jsx inside a nextjs page, `>` works as expected
