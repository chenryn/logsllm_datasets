Hi,  
I am using Superset 0.19.0 to connect Spark Sql. I need to query my temp
tables in spark. The database is created and connection is OK. I also was able
to create a table by selecting my database connection and giving the table
name and empty schema name ( Spark temp tables don't have a database/schema ).
I am able to load data from my table and visualize it.

Now I want to query my tables from SQL Lab, but I can't access the tables. The
reason is that If I don't select any schema, I can't see or search my table
names.

Is it possible to make SQL Lab view and query tables which are NOT in any
database/schema?
