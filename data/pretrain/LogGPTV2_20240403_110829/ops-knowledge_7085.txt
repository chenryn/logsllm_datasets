Question: "Considering the limitations of block ciphers in terms of deterministic encryption and fixed-length input, select the block cipher mode(s) of operation that solve these issues by using randomization or statefulness in their encryption algorithm."
 "A": "ECB Mode because it encrypts each block with a unique key derived from the message block itself."
 "B": "CBC Mode since it uses an initialization vector (IV) that introduces randomness into the encryption process."
 "C": "CFB Mode because it operates in a feedback loop that depends on the previous ciphertext block."
 "D": "OFB Mode because it uses an initial vector (IV) and generates a sequence of values that are encrypted to create a one-time pad."
Answer: BCD
