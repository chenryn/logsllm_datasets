for the Android platform. In the rest top-10 of developers, we can distin-
guish several companies. For instance, MobiSystems 5, a multi-device mo-
bile application development providing o(cid:14)ce and dictionary solution apps,
Aurora Softworks 6, a company specializing in benchmark tools for mobile
devices, OneStepAhead 7 that provides geospatial technologies and web so-
lutions apps, as well as FlyerIndustries providing email and social network
apps (e.g. a very popular Facebook client).
As we can see, the total income does not seem to be proportional to the
number of applications of developer, if we exclude the cases of MobiSystems
and OneStepAhead. To con(cid:12)rm this, we calculated the Pearson’s correlation
coe(cid:14)cient between the number of paid apps of each developer and her total
income. We found that the coe(cid:14)cient value was 0.008, that does not imply
a relationship between these two quantities. This is very interesting, as it
implies that quality is more important than quantity for developers income.
An illustration of this disassociation is depicted in Figure 7.7 where x axis
contains the average total income of the developers binned by number of
apps, and y axis includes the di(cid:11)erent app amount bins. As we can see, the
graph does not show any obvious pattern.
7.3 Income per Category
Having studied the income of developers, we now focus on the total income
of apps across di(cid:11)erent categories. Figure 7.8 shows the total income of apps
for the di(cid:11)erent app categories along with the number of available apps in
these categories.

CHAPTER 7. APP PRICING
Figure 7.7: Number of paid apps vs income per developer in SlideMe
marketplace.
Figure 7.8: Total income per app category in SlideMe marketplace.
As we see from the graph, there is no correlation between the number of
apps that a category contains and the income gained from the apps of the
respective category. In other words, the fact that a category includes a large

portion of the total number of apps in the appstore, does not imply that this
category will gain a large portion of the total income of all apps. The top
category in terms of income seems to be music, followed by fun/games along
with utilities and productivity, that look to have same levels of income. We
attempt to see if the same view also exists for the average income per app
per category. This result is shown in Figure 7.9. We kept the categories

place.
in x axis ordered as in the previous Figure 7.8 for an easier side by side
comparison. Comparing the two graphs (of Figures 7.9 and 7.8), there is not
an obvious connection between the total income of apps per category with
the average income per category. Moreover, the previous conclusion that the
income is not correlated with the population of apps in a category applies
here too. In order to have a better view of this inference, we illustrate the
distribution of percentages of apps in the di(cid:11)erent categories along with the
distribution of percentages of income across those categories in Figure 7.10.
The (cid:12)gure clearly shows that although category E-books contains the highest
percentage of apps (33% Figure 7.10(a)), has not proportionately the largest
percentage of the total income. The category with the largest portion of
income is music (that have the 67% of income, as we see in Figure 7.10(b))
and similarly music is not included in the categories with the larger number
of apps. The same analogy applies also to the rest categories as shown in
the graph, except the games category which seems to have an equal share
of income and number of apps.

7.4 Can Free Apps Make Higher Income Than
Paid Apps?
In this section we attempt to explore if there is a possibility for free apps
to make higher income volume than paid apps. First, we provide some in-
formation on how apps are distributed across the di(cid:11)erent categories. Fig-
ure 7.11 shows which portion of apps belongs to paid apps and to free apps
per category. We see that free apps dominate in all categories except from
collaboration and E-books.

Then, we we examine whether the relative percentages of apps across cat-
egories are similar to unpaid ones. The results are shown in the Figure 7.12.
We can see that the set of the 4 dominant categories of paid apps, which are
E-books, fun/games, educational and wallpapers, is di(cid:11)erent from this one of
free apps containing fun/games, entertainment, utilities and lifestyle.
Figure 7.12: Relative percentages of free and paid apps across categories
in SlideMe marketplace.
Afterwards we focus our interest in the income related with the free apps.
Generally, several adverse incidents related with the use of advertisements
in mobile applications have been reported, e.g. many ads that integrate
advertisements seem to pose privacy and security risks [8, 45]. Moreover, a
recent study [50] demonstrated that the 65%-75% of energy in free apps is
spent in third-party advertisement modules. One major advantage of paid
over free apps is that the former rarely use advertisements, while for the
later, advertisements or simple ads constitute the main source of income. In
order to compute the income of a free app that uses ads, the Click-through
Rate is needed. Click-through Rate is given from the following formula:
CT R =
Clicks
Impressions
The Impressions is the number of times an ad is displayed in a mobile device
independently of the ad clicks. The Clicks on the above formula is the num-
ber of times a user have clicked on an add of a given app. Unfortunately,
there is no such information available on the appstores in general, as it is

kept from the advertising networks unpublished. For this reason, the ques-
tion we will attempt to answer is: How much do developers of free apps need
to gain per download in order to match the income of paid apps? It would
be desirable to compute this amount only for the free apps in SlideMe mar-
ketplace that uses ads. To this end, we needed to (cid:12)nd which of our collected
apps are equipped with ads. To do this, we used Androguard [6], an Android
reverse engineering analysis tool capable of detect ad/open source libraries.
For each collected APK (cid:12)le we examine which of the top-20 advertising li-
braries, according to this paper [45], were used. Figure 7.13 shows the CDF
of the unique advertising networks per app in SlideMe appstore. Regarding
the graph, 33% of the apps do not seem to use advertisements (at least one
of the 20 most popular ad networks), and the rest 67% are equipped with
ads. We can see that most apps use a few number of advertising networks,
where a small percentage, 1% of them use up to 12 di(cid:11)erent ad libraries.
Then, we would like to see how the di(cid:11)erent ad networks are distributed

these apps.

(b) Developers
Figure 7.14: Advertising Networks usage among apps and developers in
SlideMe appstore.
The results of these distributions are shown in Figure 7.14. We can see
that ad networks’ usage rates appear to be approximately the same among
apps and developers. The most popular advertising networks seem to be
Google AdSense along with AdMob and Airpush which are utilized from the
majority of the free apps (Figure 7.14(a)). Notice that the percentages are
not sum up to 100%, as there are several apps that use more than one ad
network. Similarly, the most popular ad networks for developers seem to be
Google AdSense, AdMob and Mobclix (Figure 7.14(b)).
Thereafter, having already isolated the free apps that use ads, we will
proceed by estimating the necessary average ad income that a free app has to
make, in order to match the income of a paid app. As we already discussed
earlier in this section, we do not have the information of the Click-through
Rate, which is essential for the computation of ad income for a free app.

CHAPTER 7. APP PRICING
Nevertheless, we are able to compute which is the necessary income for a
free app (per download) in order to match the income of a paid app based on
the number of downloads. We compute this value by equating the average
income (per app per download) of free apps with the respective average
income of paid apps:
Ad Income =
i=1
(7.1)
NpaidP
j=1
Downloads(i) (cid:2) P rice(i)=Npaid
Nf reeP
Downloads(j)=Nf ree
Thus, the average necessary ad income for a free app can be calculated
based on the formula 7.1. To proceed our analysis, we calculate the necessary
average ad income values for the last three months of our measurement
period. The results are illustrated in Figure 7.15, where we can see that
Figure 7.15: Average necessary ad income per app per download along
with the average price of paid apps through time in SlideMe marketplace.
necessary ad income on average is 0.21 dollars. That is, 0.21 dollars per
download, are needed by a free app in average so as to match the income
of the average paid app. Moreover, we see that necessary ad income is
dropping over time. It seems that this drop over time happens due to the
fact that downloads of free apps are increasing much faster than those of
paid apps. To con(cid:12)rm this hypothesis, we attempted to plot the downloads
as a function of time, for all the new apps added in the SlideMe appstore
during our measurement interval. In particular, we isolate all the new added
apps, divide them into free and paid, and collect their downloads in di(cid:11)erent

bins (day-bins), one containing the number of app downloads for the (cid:12)rst
day of their lifetime, one for their second day, one for their third day, etc.
Consequently, the day-bins will not contain download samples from the same
number of apps. Actually, the number of apps decreases for each following
day-bin, as there are apps with di(cid:11)erent lifespan. To put it di(cid:11)erently, there
are apps entered in SlideMe appstore the last day of the measurements, the
penultimate day, and generally N days before the end of the measurements.
Thus, we expect the (cid:12)rst day-bin to have the largest number of apps, as
it contains download samples of the (cid:12)rst day of lifetime of all apps, then
the second day-bin will have fewer apps, as there are apps that are alive
only for 1 day (the last one), etc. Then, we compute the average number of
downloads of these bins for each day. Figure 7.16 depicts the results of this
Figure 7.16: Mean downloads per app over time of free and paid apps
that were added in the SlideMe appstore within our measurement period.
analysis. As expected, downloads of free apps are grow at a faster rate than
those of paid apps. The thin black lines, that appear to drop downward in
the second y axis (on the right), indicate the set of active apps, on which
the average income value is currently computed. As already mentioned, the
number of apps is fewer for each subsequent day-bin because there are apps
with di(cid:11)erent lifetimes.
Afterwards, we would like to see whether free-app ads strategy is better
or not. That is, maybe this is true for very popular apps but not for the
ones with a few downloads. To be able to draw conclusions, we attempted to
replot the previous graph showing the necessary ad income through time, for
apps in di(cid:11)erent popularity levels. To this end, we proceed to make a kind

of app binning based on the number of downloads (app popularity) that the
apps had at the last day of the measurements. Thus, we separated the apps
in 3 di(cid:11)erent popularity bins: highly popular which contains the top 20%
of most popular apps, medium popular that contains the next 50% of the
popular apps, and (cid:12)nally, unpopular that contains the 30% of least popular
applications. Figure 7.17 shows the average necessary ad income for the 3

Average necessary ad income per download so that the income of free apps is
matching the income of the paid apps. We have used 3 di(cid:11)erent bins of apps
(popular: top 20% of popular apps, medium popular: next 50% of popular apps
and unpopular: least 30% of popular apps).
di(cid:11)erent popularity bins. We can see that the bin with the most popular
apps needs at least 0.039 dollars per download per app, so that the income of
a free app surpasses this of a paid one. Moreover, this income value becomes
almost 9 times higher for an app in the medium popularity bin and 42 times
greater for an unpopular app! This means that even for medium-popularity
applications, it actually makes sense to choose the ads strategy. We also
observe that the necessary ad income is dropping over time. This happens
because of the faster growth of free apps’ downloads versus those of the paid
ones. We can con(cid:12)rm this by plotting the downloads as a function of time
for di(cid:11)erent popularity app volumes, as shown in Figure 7.18. We observed
similar behaviour exhibited by lower popularity volumes too.

We already found that high- and medium-popularity applications are
ideal for choosing the ads strategy in order to gain income. Accordingly, we
would like to examine whether this conclusion changes by category. We (cid:12)rst
compute the necessary ad income for all apps per category (Figure 7.19),
and then for the popularity bins of apps per category (Figure 7.20), as we
have already de(cid:12)ned. In Figure 7.19(a), we see the average price of paid
apps per category, while in Figure 7.19(b), we see the average necessary ad
income of the free apps among di(cid:11)erent categories. We kept the same order
of categories in the two graphs for a better side-by-side comparison. We see
that there is no correlation between the average price per category and the
