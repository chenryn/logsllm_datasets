We're parsing `widgets.json` to take advantage of the widget categories in the
inspector. In the process of adding some validation, I noticed that the
following widgets show up more than once (and with different categorizations):
  * `GridView`
  * `ListView`
  * `Transform`
Here are the raw bits:
      {
        "name": "GridView",
        "description": "A grid list consists of a repeated pattern of cells arrayed in a vertical and horizontal layout. The GridView widget implements this component.",
        "categories": [],
        "subcategories": [
          "Information displays"
        ],
        "link": "https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/widgets/GridView-class.html",
        "image": ""
      },
      {
        "name": "GridView",
        "description": "A scrollable, 2D array of widgets.",
        "categories": [
        ],
        "subcategories": [
          "Multi-child layout widgets"
        ],
        "link": "https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/widgets/GridView-class.html",
        "image": ""
      },
      {
        "name": "GridView",
        "description": "A scrollable, 2D array of widgets. The most commonly used grid layouts are GridView.count, which creates a layout with a fixed number of tiles in the cross axis, and GridView.extent, which creates a layout with tiles that have a maximum cross-axis extent. A custom SliverGridDelegate can produce an aribtrary 2D arrangement of children, including arrangements that are unaligned or overlapping.",
        "categories": [
          "Scrolling"
        ],
        "subcategories": [
        ],
        "link": "https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/widgets/GridView-class.html",
        "image": ""
      },
      {
        "name": "ListView",
        "sample": "ListView_index",
        "description": "A scrollable, linear list of widgets. ListView is the most commonly used scrolling widget. It displays its children one after another in the scroll direction. In the cross axis, the children are required to fill the ListView.",
        "categories": [
        ],
        "subcategories": [
          "Multi-child layout widgets"
        ],
        "link": "https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/widgets/ListView-class.html",
        "image": ""
     {
        "name": "ListView",
        "description": "A scrollable, linear list of widgets. ListView is the most commonly used scrolling widget. It displays its children one after another in the scroll direction. In the cross axis, the children are required to fill the ListView.",
        "categories": [

        ],
        "subcategories": [
        ],
        "link": "https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/widgets/ListView-class.html",
        "image": ""
      },
      {
        "name": "Transform",
        "description": "A widget that applies a transformation before painting its child.",
        "categories": [
        ],
        "subcategories": [
          "Single-child layout widgets"
        ],

        "image": ""
      },
      {
        "name": "Transform",
        "description": "A widget that applies a transformation before painting its child.",
        "categories": [
          "Painting and effects"
        ],

        "link": "https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/widgets/Transform-class.html",

      },
I'm happy to update the JSON but I'm not sure which categorizations should
win. ðŸ˜„
