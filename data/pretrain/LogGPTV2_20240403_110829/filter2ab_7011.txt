### Title: Blackhat Asia-23: A Run a Day Won't Keep the Hacker Away: Inference Attacks on Endpoint Privacy Zones in Fitness Tracking Social Networks

Fitness tracking social networks, such as Strava, enable users to record and publicly share their sports activities. While sharing promotes peer interaction, it also poses a risk, as the start or finish of an activity can inadvertently reveal privacy-sensitive locations, such as a user's home or workplace. To mitigate this risk, these networks have introduced endpoint privacy zones (EPZs), which obscure portions of the track around protected locations.

However, our research demonstrates that the EPZ implementations of major fitness tracking services remain vulnerable to inference attacks. These attacks significantly reduce the effective anonymity provided by EPZs and can even reveal the protected locations. Our attack exploits distance information leaked in activity metadata, street grid data, and the locations of the entry points into the EPZ. This information allows us to narrow down the search space, where we then use regression analysis to predict the protected locations.

Our evaluation, based on 1.4 million Strava activities, shows that our attack successfully discovers the protected location for up to 85% of EPZs. We found that larger EPZs reduce the effectiveness of our attack, while geographically dispersed activities in sparser street grids yield better performance.

To address these vulnerabilities, we propose six countermeasures. However, these countermeasures come with a trade-off in terms of usability. We have responsibly disclosed our findings and proposed countermeasures to the major fitness tracking networks.
