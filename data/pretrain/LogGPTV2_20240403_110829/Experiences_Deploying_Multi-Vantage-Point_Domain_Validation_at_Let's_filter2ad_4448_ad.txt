### Section: Evaluating multiVA's Effectiveness in Mitigating BGP Attacks

In this section, we demonstrate the capability of multiVA to mitigate ethically launched real-world BGP attacks. This methodology provides insights into how multiVA interacts with actual Internet routing. Given that BGP attacks can only be launched from a limited number of locations, we complement this approach with simulated attacks in Section 6.3, which yield consistent results.

#### Verification and Security Improvements

First, we verify that multiVA correctly distinguishes between primary and remote Validation Authorities (VAs), ensuring that all certificates signed under multiVA are a subset of those that would be signed without it. Our measurements show that an AWS-only deployment detects up to 94% of attacks, even when all remote vantage points are hosted by the same cloud provider. The security improvements are particularly significant for certain domains. Additionally, the few BGP attacks that manage to deceive multiple vantage points are highly visible and can be mitigated by other BGP attack-prevention methods. We discuss how adding more vantage points can further enhance security (see ยง6.3).

#### Launching Ethical Attacks

We used the PEERING platform [44] to launch BGP attacks, allowing us to make real-world BGP announcements. Our experimental setup included one adversary server and one victim server, each connected to a PEERING mux. Figure 11 illustrates the setup. We began by having the victim's server announce an IP prefix we controlled. The adversary server then hijacked the victim's IP prefix by announcing it to the neu01 mux in an equally-specific prefix hijack attack. The adversary server then requested a certificate for the victim's domain. Let's Encrypt did not authorize the certificate because the remote vantage points detected the attack. System logs from the adversary server indicated that the primary data centers were routing data to the adversary, and the attack would have succeeded without multi-vantage-point domain control validation.

#### Characterization of Attack Mitigation

To explore the effectiveness of multiVA against various potential adversaries, we considered all possible adversaries (i.e., other PEERING muxes) attacking the victim domain hosted by wisc01. Without multiVA, the victim's domain was resilient to only 17% of the attacks. With multiVA, the resilience increased to 85%, as the additional attacks were detected by Let's Encrypt's AWS-hosted remote vantage points using the k-n quorum policy.

Next, we varied our attacks by selecting different available PEERING muxes for the victim and the adversary. Overall, we launched attacks from 62 different configurations and analyzed multiVA security with different quorum policies. With Let's Encrypt's quorum policy, 67% of the attacks failed to obtain certificates, compared to 48% with the previous single-data-center configuration. Notably, multiVA had a significant impact on the most vulnerable domains, such as the victim domain in wisc01, which saw a fivefold improvement in attack mitigation. Ten of the attacks detected by multiVA under Let's Encrypt's quorum policy were against three highly impacted victim domains, where the fraction of attacks mitigated increased from 20% to 72%.

While Let's Encrypt's current quorum policy offers substantial improvement for the most vulnerable domains, a full quorum policy is more effective at protecting the average domain. 58 out of 62 attacks (94%) were detected by multiVA with a full quorum policy of k=3. This result demonstrates that even if a single cloud provider hosts all remote VAs, multiVA can significantly reduce the attack surface of BGP attacks.

#### Ethical Considerations

We took several steps to ensure our attacks were ethical. The domains we used had no real users and were pointed to IP addresses in the prefixes allocated to us by the PEERING framework. We only requested certificates for these domains, which were registered specifically for our experiments. We followed all policies and guidelines of the PEERING framework, including not announcing any prefixes other than those allocated to us and not spoofing packets from IP prefixes outside the PEERING framework range.

#### Example of Successful Attack Mitigation

To demonstrate how multiVA mitigates real-world BGP attacks, we used the University of Wisconsin - Madison (wisc01) mux for the victim's domain and North Eastern University (neu01) mux for the adversary. Our setup measured that the Salt Lake City and Denver data centers (along with the Frankfurt remote vantage point) routed validation requests to the adversary, but the Oregon and Ohio remote vantage points were able to reach the legitimate domain and thwart the attack.

The four attacks where Let's Encrypt vantage points were unable to reach the victim were due to the adversary significantly overpowering the victim in terms of network connectivity. For example, two of these attacks used the PEERING mux in Amsterdam as the adversary, which has substantially richer connectivity than any other PEERING mux. While these results highlight the limits of multiVA, our approach significantly reduces the number of viable BGP attacks against domain validation. Deploying a small number of additional vantage points can further reduce the number of successful attacks (as discussed in Section 6.3).

### Quantifying the Security of multiVA

While our evaluation in Section 5 used real-world BGP attacks, we were limited to considering PEERING muxes as target domains and adversary locations. In this section, we evaluate the security of the multiVA deployment with respect to real-world domains served by Let's Encrypt and any AS-level adversary. We use a combination of Internet-scale traceroutes and Internet topology simulations to assess system security. Our analysis focuses on the following questions:

- How effective is Let's Encrypt's current quorum policy and set of vantage points at catching localized BGP attacks on domain control validation?
- How many more attacks would be caught under a full/strict quorum policy that uses results from all three remote VAs?
- How much would additional vantage points enhance security, and where should these remote VAs be located?

#### Evaluation Methodology

We first introduce the primary dataset we collected to facilitate our analysis and discuss the analysis techniques we used.

**Domain Dataset:**
By parsing log data shared with us by Let's Encrypt, we collected 47 million domains seen in the Subject Alternative Name (SAN) field of certificates issued by Let's Encrypt between April 13th and May 13th, 2018. For each domain, we also collected the IP address Let's Encrypt used for HTTP and TLS-based domain control validation. 43 million domains used HTTP and TLS-based domain control validation to IPv4 and were included in our final dataset.

**Overview of Evaluation Methodology:**
To balance capturing the dynamics of real Internet routing and the flexibility of simulations, we used two techniques: traceroutes and Internet-topology simulations, to evaluate the security provided by Let's Encrypt's vantage points.

- **Traceroutes:**
  We ran traceroutes to the IP addresses of the domains in the dataset from the three AWS locations used by Let's Encrypt. We recorded the percentage of AS-level paths that were identical across the data centers. These measurements allow us to study the routes to real domains and weigh our results based on the number of domains reached via a given route.

- **Internet-Topology Simulations:**
  We ran simulations of BGP hijacks against domains on an inferred Internet topology, augmented with information about differences in connectivity across AWS data centers. This allowed us to better understand the location of Let's Encrypt's vantage points relative to both the locations of domains using the PKI and potential sources of BGP attacks.

The traceroute experiments allow us to study real Internet routing to real domains (albeit in the absence of BGP attacks), while the simulation experiments allow us to study the effects of BGP attacks (albeit under an inferred Internet topology). Together, these results help us understand the effectiveness of multiVA across a diverse set of source vantage points, destination victim domains, and possible adversaries.

#### Traceroute Path Diversity of Remote VAs

We assessed the path diversity of vantage points with respect to the real-world distribution of domains. We performed traceroutes from Let's Encrypt's vantage points towards the domains in the dataset and used traceroute similarity across vantage points as a metric for path diversity.

Of the 43 million domains in our dataset, we performed traceroutes to a randomly chosen sample of 250,000 (0.6%). For each domain, we traced the route to the domain's IP address used by Let's Encrypt. There were 67,000 unique IP addresses in total. We performed these traceroutes from the three Let's Encrypt remote vantage points (Oregon, Ohio, and Frankfurt). We resolved each IP address seen in the traceroute results to an ASN using the originating AS of that IP address in the current global BGP routing table, followed by the originating AS listed in the whois record for that IP address. We filtered the traceroute results to exclude any traceroute that did not have any IP addresses resolve to an ASN other than the ASN of Let's Encrypt's vantage points. We were left with valid traceroutes to 192,000 domains.

Table 12 outlines our results. We found that 80% of domains with traceroute information were reached via different AS-level forwarding paths from different vantage points. Even for the 20% of domains that have the same paths, intra-AS routing differences might still allow vantage points to route independently in the event of a BGP hijack.

Ohio and Oregon had significantly more domains using similar paths than Ohio and Frankfurt or Oregon and Frankfurt. This result supports the importance of geographic diversity in vantage points and explains the security improvements seen in ยง5.3 for the full quorum policy. We expect other cloud providers to have similarly diverse routing.
