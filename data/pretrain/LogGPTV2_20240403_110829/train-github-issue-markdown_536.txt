##### Issue Type:
Fancy Corner Case Bug
##### Ansible Version:
Introduced in current devel as well as 1.8.2 and up.  
In the 1.8 tree, the bug was introduced by `4cd87ec`
Note that while the bug is unrelated, this "faulty" commit is the same as for
#9753
##### Environment:
N/A (tested on Ubuntu 14.04)
##### Summary:
Using a key pointing to a variable, that itself is defined as another variable
construct, in combination with group_by, the resulting key (probably that
subvar) is onlky calculated once for the first host, so all hosts are put in
the same group.
##### Steps To Reproduce:
Create an inventory `hosts` file with some hosts where the first three chars
point to a datacenter:
    dc1-ch1-bl1                                                                     
    dc2-ch1-bl2                                                                     
    dc1-ch1-bl3                                                                     
    dc2-ch1-bl4                                                                     
    dc2-ch1-bl5   
and provide this variable in `group_vars/all.yml`:
    datacenter: '{{ inventory_hostname[:3] }}'
Test with the commmand  
`ansible all -i hosts -c local -m group_by -a key={{datacenter}}`
Also change the _first_ host in the inventory file from `dc1-ch1-bl1` to
`dc2-ch1-bl1` and observe the difference.
##### Expected Results:
Works with ansible release1.8.1 `ad67523` last updated 2014/12/02 10:53:48
(GMT +200):
    $ ansible all -i hosts -c local -m group_by -a key={{datacenter}}
    dc1-ch1-bl1 | success >> {
        "changed": true, 
        "groups": {
            "dc1": [
                "dc1-ch1-bl1", 
                "dc1-ch1-bl3"
            ], 
            "dc2": [
                "dc2-ch1-bl2", 
                "dc2-ch1-bl4", 
                "dc2-ch1-bl5"
            ]
        }
    }
##### Actual Results:
    dc1-ch1-bl1 | success >> {
        "changed": true,
        "groups": {
            "dc1": [
                "dc1-ch1-bl1",
                "dc2-ch1-bl2",
                "dc1-ch1-bl3",
                "dc2-ch1-bl4",
                "dc2-ch1-bl5"
            ]
        }
    }
or after changing the _first_ host in the inventory file from `dc1-ch1-bl1` to
`dc2-ch1-bl1`:
    dc2-ch1-bl1 | success >> {
        "changed": true,
        "groups": {
            "dc2": [
                "dc2-ch1-bl1",
                "dc2-ch1-bl2",
                "dc1-ch1-bl3",
                "dc2-ch1-bl4",
                "dc2-ch1-bl5"
            ]
        }
    }
