NECESSARY DISCLAIMER:
This talk discusses various illegal techniques and concepts.
The author does not endorse nor does he condone the 
execution of any of those illegal activities discussed.
ESPECIALLY the Information Warfare concepts.
Types of Intelligence Gathering
 Competitive Intelligence
 Corporate Espionage
 Information Warfare
 Personal Investigation
(*This talk is NOT about going to school to “become intelligent”, in case 
anyone expected that to be covered.)
Competitive Intelligence
 Relies solely on legal and ethical means to gather 
data, piece it together to form information, and 
analyze it to create intelligence for the use of 
decision-makers 
 Over 95 percent of the information companies 
require to compete successfully is available in the 
public domain
 Helps organizations better understand their 
competitive environment and make sound business 
decisions 
Corporate Espionage
Corporate Espionage
 “Espionage” - the collection, collation, and analysis of illicitly gained 
information
 “Corporate Espionage” - the theft of trade secrets for economic gain
 “Trade Secret” - property right which has value by providing an 
advantage in business over competitors who do not know the secret
 International Trade Commission estimates current annual losses to 
U.S. industries due to corporate espionage to be over $70 billion
How It’s Generally Done
 Over 70% of capers involve “Inside Jobs”
– Disgruntled employees
– Bribes from a competitor
– Cleaning crews
– Industrial mole
 False Pretenses
– Companies hire a competitors employee for their trade 
knowledge
– Applicant interviews only to pump potential employer for 
information, or vice versa
– Spy pretends to be a student,  journalist, or venture capitalist
Who’s Doing It?
 Foreign governments and corporations
– Russia, China, South Korea, India, Pakistan, Germany, Israel, 
Argentina, Taiwan, Indonesia, France, etc.
– FBI indicates that 57 of 173 nations are running operations to 
actively target U.S. corporations
– U.S. “officially” does not participate…(COUGH)
 Employees
 Professional industrial spies
 Members of the Society for Competitive Intelligence Professionals
 Business consultants (some in this room?)
 H4x0rs (also some in this room?)
What’s Useful to an Attacker?
Structure – organization hierarchical structures, departmental diagrams, etc.
Infrastructure – phone system network diagrams, enterprise IT network diagrams, IT 
groups, support groups, utilities providers (phone/power/water etc), 
People – Phone directories, e-mail address books, who’s who directories etc, visitor 
instructions, new starter induction packs (i.e., everything you need to know to get 
around!).
Geography – super-imposed on hierarchical structures – where is the IT department, 
where are the servers, etc.
Security Enforcing Functions – physical access control, password policy, hardware 
re-use, firewall / IDS use, e-mail policies, phone-use policies, etc.
Networks – detailed network topologies IP & phone – including firewall, router, and 
proxy positions.
Software/hardware – what machines are used, operating systems (service pack & hot 
fix /patch levels), server software, host software, database software, web server server 
software, and administration policies.
The Basic Methodology
 Initial Public Intelligence
 Social Engineering
 Physical Security Analysis
 Network Analysis
 Information System Attacks
Initial Public Intelligence
 Meta-Search engines (DogPile, WebFerret), used initially and as more 
collaborative data is gathered
 Company searches - the SEC Edgar database 
(www.sec.gov/edgarhp.htm) - all information is free
 Gathering names (for later identity spoofing, social engineering, 
tracing)
 Gathering phone numbers (for later contacts or war-dialing)
 Finding IT suppliers (to help determine network components)
 Check newsgroups, web boards, and industry feedback sites for 
company info (may yield LOTS of information)
Social Engineering
 Generally done remotely - requires a degree of deception, 
masquerade, and motivation
 Examples are:
– Gain access privileges by querying  administrative personnel over 
communications medium such as telephone, fax, e-mail, postal mail 
chat, or bulletin boards from a fraudulent “privileged” position 
(manager, auditor, law enforcement, etc.)
– Gain access privileges by querying administrative or help desk 
personnel over the same mediums as above from a fraudulent “non-
privileged” position (confused end user, new contractor, etc.)
– Invite inside personnel out to a “social business function”, to probe them 
to disclose information outside of the office (over drinks, strippers, 
ecstasy, etc.)
Physical Security Analysis
 Identify monitored access points, coverage, and routes (both by 
physical guard and/or electronic means)
 Identify alarm equipment, triggers, response personnel and procedures
 Identify access privileges through physical access points (side/back 
doors, under/over fences, windows, roof, weak locks, etc.)
 Identify weaknesses in the location (line-of-sight visible/audible areas 
into the target)
 Identify supply delivery personnel/organizations
 Identify trash disposal or recycling methods
Network Analysis
 Network Survey
– Derive domain name (company name, web presence, etc.)
– Query ARIN for IP blocks and sub-domains
– “dig” domain for DNS servers
– Zone transfer all available DNS domains and sub-domains
– Check public web server source for server links
– Send e-mail and check headers of bounced mails or read receipts
– Search P2P services for organization connections
Network Analysis (cont.)
 Network Survey
– War-dial to locate modem-enabled systems and fax 
machines
– Test for default authentication, easily guessed 
password, and remote maintenance accounts
– Test for exploitable PBX access
– Attempt PIN-hacking of voice-mail boxes
Network Analysis (cont.)
 IP/Port Scanning
– Use broadcast ICMP echo to determine existence of systems
– Try DNS connect attempts on all hosts
– Use “firewalking” to verify ports open through any firewall
– Use nbtstat and “net use” (null session) scans for Netbios (Windows) 
hosts (port 137)
– Send packets with TCP source port 80 and ACK set on ports 3100-3150, 
10001-10050, 33500-33550, 35000-35050 on all hosts
– Send TCP fragments in reverse order with FIN, NULL, and XMAS scans 
on ports 21, 22, 23, 25, 80, and 443 on all hosts
Network Analysis (cont.)
 IP/Port Scanning (cont.)
– Send TCP SYN packets on ports 21, 22, 23, 25, 80, and 443 on all 
hosts
– Send TCP fragments in reverse order to any list of popular ports 
that may be subject to a variety of exploits
– Use UDP scans on any list of popular ports that may be subject to 
a variety of exploits
– Use banner-grabbing and other fingerprinting techniques to 
identify O/S’s & apps
– Infer services/protocols/apps via open ports found
Network Analysis (cont.)
 Retrieve useful information from hidden field variables of 
HTML forms and from HTML comments
 Retrieve useful information from application banners, 
usage instructions, help messages, error messages
 Retrieve useful information stored in cookies
 Retrieve useful information from cache or serialized 
objects
 Determine wireless access points (wireless sniffer, 
aeropeek, etc.)
Information System Attacks
 Use publicly known exploits against identified apps via 
fingerprinting and port-scanning
 Attack via default system backdoors (O/S, DB, apps)
 Use dictionary or brute-force password attacks
 Gather PDF’s, Word docs, spreadsheets and run password crackers 
on encrypted or protected docs
 Capture and replay authentication credentials
 Attack printers to re-route printouts
Information System Attacks (cont.)
 Use directory traversal or direct instruction attacks on web apps
 Use long character-strings to find buffer overflows
 Use cross-side scripting attacks against web apps
 Execute remote commands via server-side includes
 Manipulate session cookies, hidden fields, or referrer/host fields to 
attack server apps
 Exploit trusted system relationships
Can Organizations Stop It?
 Identify sensitive information, identify the threats, and provide 
adequate safeguards (data labeling, access control, encryption, 
shredding, network access controls, IDS, etc.)
 Don’t ignore security warnings, best practices, or expert advice
 Educate employees about protecting confidential information
 Fight for an adequate security budget
 Have employees, vendors, and partners sign non-disclosure 
agreements
 Routinely test all security areas (physical, logical, social, etc.)
 Sweep for surveillance equipment
Information Warfare
Information Warfare
 “Information Warfare” – state-sponsored information 
and electronically delivered actions taken to achieve 
information superiority in support of national military 
strategy 
 Meant to affect enemy information and information 
systems while protecting our information and 
information systems
 Includes electronic warfare, surveillance systems, 
precision strike, and advanced battlefield 
management
Who’s Doing It?
Governments
– China, South Korea, Russia, India, Pakistan, Germany, Israel, Argentina, 
Taiwan, Indonesia, France, U.S., Al Qaeda, etc.
Planted employees
Ex-Cold War spies
Former intelligence employees
Professional hackers
PhD’s in Computer Science - with millions in government backing
The U.S. Air Force, Army, and Navy have established Information Warfare 
(IW) centers 
Military information “war games” are now being conducted to prepare for 
such contingencies (both offensively and defensively)
Information Warfare Categories
 Offensive - Deny, corrupt, destroy, or exploit an 
adversary’s information, and influence the adversary’s 
perception
 Exploitative - Exploit available information  to enhance the 
nation’s decision/action cycle, and disrupt the adversary’s 
cycle
 Defensive - Safeguard the nation and allies from similar 
actions, also known as IW hardening.
Cyber Warfare
 In the U.S., more than 95% of military communications are conducted 
over commercial systems (phone, fax, Internet, NIPRNET, SIPRNET, 
satellite)
 An increasing amount of technology is being used to fight wars (from 
un-manned attack systems to cyber-enabled war-fighters)
 Military information systems and applications drive JTF warfare 
decisions (personnel/technical assets, logistics, and strategy)
 The identifiable U.S. targets and their risks have changed drastically

Techno-Terrorist Warfare
Terrorism (FBI definition) - The unlawful use of force or violence against 
persons or property to intimidate or coerce a government, the civilian 
population, or any segment thereof, in furtherance of political or social 
objectives
International Terrorism (CIA definition) – Terrorist activities conducted with 
the support of foreign governments or organizations and/or directed against 
foreign nations, institutions, or governments
Terrorism (DoD definition) - Premeditated, politically motivated violence 
perpetrated against a non-combatant target by sub-national groups or 
clandestine state agents, usually intended to influence an audience
Governments and terrorists are CURRENTLY ACTIVELY PLANNING 
ATTACKS on U.S. critical infrastructure components (both in support of 
military actions, and to turn the general “quality of life” for U.S. citizens to 
shit)
Techno-Terrorist Warfare Techniques
Using a computer, penetrate a control tower computer system and send false 
signals to aircraft, causing them to crash in mid-air or fall to the ground
Use fraudulent credit cards to finance their operations
Penetrate a financial computer system and divert millions of dollars to finance 
their activities
Use cloned cellular phones and computers over the Internet to communicate, 
using encryption to protect their transmissions
Use virus and worm programs to shut down vital government computer 
systems

overdose of medicine or the wrong medicine, or modifying 
computerized test analysis to alter all future results
Techno-Terrorist Warfare Techniques 
(cont.)
 Destroy critical government computer systems
 Penetrate computerized train routing systems, causing passenger trains 
to collide
 Take over telecommunications links or shut them down
 Take over satellite links to broadcast their messages over televisions 
and radios
 And MOST LIKELY of all, disrupt power, gas, water, transportation, 
and telecommunications systems (critical infrastructure components)
