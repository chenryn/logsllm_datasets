## Types of Intelligence Gathering
1. **Competitive Intelligence**
2. **Corporate Espionage**
3. **Information Warfare**
4. **Personal Investigation**

*(Note: This talk is not about academic intelligence or educational pursuits.)*

### Competitive Intelligence
- **Definition:** Competitive Intelligence (CI) relies on legal and ethical means to gather data, analyze it, and create actionable intelligence for decision-makers.
- **Availability:** Over 95% of the information companies need to compete successfully is available in the public domain.
- **Benefits:** CI helps organizations understand their competitive environment and make informed business decisions.

### Corporate Espionage
- **Definition:** Corporate Espionage involves the illicit collection, collation, and analysis of information, often for economic gain.
- **Trade Secrets:** A trade secret is a property right that provides a competitive advantage.
- **Economic Impact:** The International Trade Commission estimates that U.S. industries lose over $70 billion annually due to corporate espionage.
- **Common Methods:**
  - **Inside Jobs:** Disgruntled employees, bribes from competitors, cleaning crews, and industrial moles.
  - **False Pretenses:** Hiring competitors' employees, conducting interviews to extract information, and posing as students, journalists, or venture capitalists.
- **Perpetrators:**
  - Foreign governments and corporations (e.g., Russia, China, South Korea, India, Pakistan, Germany, Israel, Argentina, Taiwan, Indonesia, France).
  - FBI reports that 57 out of 173 nations target U.S. corporations.
  - Employees, professional industrial spies, members of the Society for Competitive Intelligence Professionals, business consultants, and hackers.

### Useful Information for Attackers
- **Structure:** Organizational hierarchies and departmental diagrams.
- **Infrastructure:** Network diagrams, IT groups, support groups, and utility providers.
- **People:** Phone directories, email address books, visitor instructions, and new starter induction packs.
- **Geography:** Physical locations of departments and critical infrastructure.
- **Security Enforcing Functions:** Access control, password policies, hardware reuse, firewalls, IDS, and communication policies.
- **Networks:** Detailed network topologies, including firewall, router, and proxy positions.
- **Software/Hardware:** Operating systems, service pack levels, server software, and administration policies.

### Basic Methodology
1. **Initial Public Intelligence**
2. **Social Engineering**
3. **Physical Security Analysis**
4. **Network Analysis**
5. **Information System Attacks**

#### Initial Public Intelligence
- **Tools:** Meta-search engines (DogPile, WebFerret), SEC Edgar database, and industry feedback sites.
- **Data Collection:** Names, phone numbers, IT suppliers, and company information.

#### Social Engineering
- **Techniques:** Deception, masquerading, and motivation.
- **Examples:**
  - Gaining access privileges by impersonating administrative personnel.
  - Probing inside personnel through social functions.
  - Using communications mediums like telephone, fax, email, and postal mail.

#### Physical Security Analysis
- **Identify:** Monitored access points, alarm equipment, access privileges, and supply delivery methods.
- **Evaluate:** Weaknesses in location, trash disposal, and surveillance equipment.

#### Network Analysis
- **Network Survey:**
  - Derive domain names, query ARIN for IP blocks, and perform DNS zone transfers.
  - Check web server source code and email headers.
  - Use P2P services and war-dialing to locate modem-enabled systems.
- **IP/Port Scanning:**
  - Use ICMP echo, DNS connect attempts, and port scanning.
  - Identify open ports and services, and use banner-grabbing and fingerprinting techniques.
- **Information Retrieval:**
  - Extract hidden field variables, HTML comments, application banners, and cookie data.
  - Determine wireless access points.

#### Information System Attacks
- **Exploits:** Use publicly known exploits, default backdoors, and dictionary or brute-force attacks.
- **Document Attacks:** Gather and crack encrypted documents.
- **Authentication:** Capture and replay credentials, and attack printers.
- **Web Applications:** Use directory traversal, buffer overflow, and cross-site scripting attacks.
- **Trusted Systems:** Exploit trusted system relationships.

### Can Organizations Stop It?
- **Safeguards:** Identify sensitive information, provide adequate security measures (data labeling, access control, encryption, shredding, network access controls, IDS).
- **Education:** Train employees on protecting confidential information.
- **Budget:** Allocate sufficient resources for security.
- **Agreements:** Require non-disclosure agreements from employees, vendors, and partners.
- **Testing:** Regularly test all security areas (physical, logical, social).

## Information Warfare
- **Definition:** State-sponsored actions to achieve information superiority in support of national military strategy.
- **Objectives:** Protect and disrupt enemy information and information systems.
- **Categories:**
  - **Offensive:** Deny, corrupt, destroy, or exploit adversary’s information.
  - **Exploitative:** Enhance decision/action cycles and disrupt the adversary’s cycle.
  - **Defensive:** Safeguard against similar actions.
- **Techniques:**
  - Virus attacks, intercepting transmissions, implanting code, and modifying content.
  - Aggregating information, providing disinformation, and conducting DoS attacks.
  - Penetrating government and logistical systems.

### Cyber Warfare
- **Context:** Over 95% of U.S. military communications are conducted over commercial systems.
- **Technology:** Unmanned systems, cyber-enabled war-fighters, and JTF warfare decisions.
- **Targets:** Critical infrastructure components, including power, gas, water, transportation, and telecommunications.

### Techno-Terrorist Warfare
- **Definitions:**
  - **Terrorism (FBI):** Unlawful use of force or violence to intimidate or coerce.
  - **International Terrorism (CIA):** Terrorist activities with foreign support.
  - **Terrorism (DoD):** Premeditated, politically motivated violence.
- **Techniques:**
  - Penetrating control tower systems, using fraudulent credit cards, and diverting funds.
  - Communicating via cloned phones and encrypted Internet, and using viruses and worms.
  - Altering medical records, disrupting critical systems, and causing train collisions.
  - Taking over telecommunications and satellite links.

## Personal Investigation
- **Definition:** Research to develop knowledge on a human subject by obtaining identifiable private information.
- **Uses:** Locating missing people, spying on individuals, and evaluating prospective employees or business partners.
- **Personal Identifiers:**
  - Full legal name, aliases, date of birth, social security number, driver's license number, and physical characteristics.
- **Investigation Methods:**
  - **Documentation:** Write down all known information about the subject.
  - **Address-Based:** Start from the person’s address and expand outward.
  - **Research:** Use city directories, property records, and marriage records.
  - **Interviews:** Speak with family, friends, and associates.
  - **Questions:** Ask detailed questions about the subject’s personal and professional life.
  - **Public Records:** Utilize public records resources.
