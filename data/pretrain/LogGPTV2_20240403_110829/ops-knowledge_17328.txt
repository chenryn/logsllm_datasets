User: This is an odd problem I am having to which I have no solution!
Every day, at around noon -- sometimes closer to 1pm -- my computer locks up. It only does so if I am running an IPython Notebook kernel.
I am running Mavericks on a MBPr 2013.
Has anyone else had this issue or related? 
How can I investigate further?
Thanks.
Assistant: just a guess, but maybe there is a feature turned on in IPython that's calling home for updates or something, and it's running at that time?  maybe check to see if it has that feature, and turn it off, and see if that helps?
EDITED: see my comment below, I don't think this is an ipython related issue.
