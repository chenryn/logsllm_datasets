User: i want to code a program using scapy, e.g. send a custom packet using scapy, and after finishing the program, i want to convert the python file into EXE file using py2exe, in order to use on windows platform without python . but i noticed that the installation of scapy for windows needs a lot of dependent file, such as pywin32, winpcap, pypcap, libdnet, pyreadline, after conversion to  exe file using py2exe, should the user install multiple file to make the program executable? my program intends to be executed in various computers. i dont want users to install so many dependent file.
Assistant: I don't think you're going to be able to accomplish what you want.  Even for the simplest scripts Py2Exe will require many dependent files. 
As for Scapy it will definitely need winpcap. I would assume it needs most of the others as well.  You could probably get away without readline, but at that point why bother?
