User: Is there a way to do multiple calls in the same "session" in Popen? For instance, can I make a call through it and then another one after it without having to concatenate the commands into one long string?
Assistant: You're not "making a call" when you use popen, you're running an executable and talking to it over stdin, stdout, and stderr. If the executable has some way of doing a "session" of work (for instance, by reading lines from stdin) then, yes, you can do it. Otherwise, you'll need to exec multiple times.
subprocess.Popen is (mostly) just a wrapper around execvp(3)
