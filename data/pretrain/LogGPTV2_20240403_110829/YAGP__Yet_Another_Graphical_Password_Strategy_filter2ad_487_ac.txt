To  a  significant  degree,  security  is  influenced  by 
password  space  size.  In  most  existing  DAS-based 
graphical  password  schemes,  the  password  space  size 
is  determined  mainly  by  the  grid  density,  the  stroke 
number and the length of each stroke. YAGP adopts a 
grid of 48×64 denser than the 5×5 grid used in DAS, as 
demonstrated by the experiment results in Section 4.1. 
With such a dense grid, it becomes easier for users to 
draw  long  strokes.  Furthermore,  YAGP  imposes  no 
limitation to the number of strokes. Therefore, YAGP

can provide a larger password space than most existing 
graphical password schemes. 
YAGP  can  also  prevent  the  brute  force  attacks 
effectively.  The  experiment  results  show  that  users 
tend to set a graphical password at the average length 
of  100.  If  the  attacker  wants  to  break  the  correct 
password  by  a  brute  force  attack,  in  the  worst  case  it

YAGP  obtains  a  good  performance  in  resisting 
shoulder  surfing.  First,  YAGP  is  a  position-free 
scheme,  the  user  can  draw  his  graphical  password 
anywhere on the canvas, which makes shoulder surfing 
a  difficult  task.  For  example,  the  user  can  make  a 
drawing  in  a  small  corner  where  it  is  harder  to  peep. 
Second, the stroke sequence cannot be reflected by the 
graph in YAGP, and authentication process sees it as a 
critical checking factor. This property ensures that the 
peeper  still  cannot  sign  in  even  if  he  glimpses  the 
images, because he could not recall the correct stroke 
sequence  set  by  the  legal  user.  Finally,  YAGP  takes 
into  account  the  drawing  trends,  which  means  it 
records  the  user  drawing  style  to  a  certain  extent. 
Therefore,

As a consequence, YAGP has credible security both 
in the password space and resisting shoulder surfing.

4. Preliminary Experiments 
to  evaluate 
Experiments  were  performed 
the 
proposed YAGP strategy. For the study, we targeted a 
population  of  experienced  computer  users.  The 
participants  were  30  university  members,  including  4 
teachers  and  26  college  students.  The  majority  of  the 
students were studying for their Master’s degrees. The 
average age of the participants was 26 years old. All of 
the users were familiar with PCs.

implementation. The interface has a grid canvas with a 
granularity of 48×64 as illustrated in Fig.15. 
4.1. Grid Granularity Selection 
encryption 
adopted 
The  grid  canvas  adopted  by  YAGP  is  a  3.5  inch 
canvas  widely  used  in  PDA  devices  with  a  width-to-
length ratio of 3:4. A grid granularity of 5×5 is used in 
DAS. However, such a rough granularity is not precise 
enough  to  express  complex  graphical  passwords.  A 
fine-grained grid is used in YAGP. Experiments were 
carried  out  on  five  groups  of  granularity  (15×20, 
30×40,  48×64,  60×80,  and  120×160).  Results  show 
that  a  grid  of  48×64  is  the  most  suitable  choice  for 
security and usability. 
The  first  stage  experiments  of  grid  granularity 
selection 
lasted  7  days  approximately.  As  an 
introduction, 
the  30  participants  were  given  ten 
minutes  to  become  familiar  with  the  YAGP  system. 
First,  each  participant  was  asked  to  draw  graphical 
passwords in a 15×20 grid canvas, and then redraw the 
graphical passwords to authenticate. At the same time, 
every  participant  peeked  at  his  neighbors’  graphical 
password and attempted to attack. Both the legal user 
and  the  attacker  could  redraw  a  maximum  of  three 
times, and the greatest similarity of each participant’s 
drawing  to  the  original  image  was  recorded.  The 
experiments were carried out several times with grid of 
different  density.  According  to  the  similarity  of  each 
participant’s redrawing, the distribution of participants 
is calculated and shown in Table2. The total number in 
the table showed the participants who have a similarity 
value  successfully.  Some  people

failed  on 
Table 2 shows that under the circumstance of 15×20 
grid,  only  20  of  30  legal  users  can  redraw  their 
graphical  passwords,  as  such  a  coarse  grained  grid 
cannot  represent  the  graphical  password  information 
well. We also found that, in general, fine-grained grids 
achieve better validation results. But that is not to say, 
the finer grained the grid, the better the validation. We 
can  see  from  the  table,  the  validated  number  under  a 
density  of  120×160  grid  is  lower  than  that  in  48×64. 
The reason is that too dense a grid makes the drawing 
trend  more  changeable,  and  therefore  harder  to  recall 
accurately. After numerous experiments, a compromise 
was achieved with a 48×64 grid.

The average length of the graphical passwords was 
evaluated based on the results of the foregoing testing. 
In a 48×64 grid, the analysis of the lengths of all the 30 
graphical  passwords  showed 
the  graphical 
password  in  YAGP  had  a  general  length  range  from 
100 to 200 which contains a huge password space.

4.2. Threshold Value Selection 
The  second  phase  was  designed  to  determine  a 
reasonable  threshold  value  of  similarity,  substantially 
affecting  the  authentication  results.  If  the  threshold 
value is too large, it has a high probability of blocking 
the  legal  user.  If  the  threshold  value  is  too  small,  it 
cannot effectively resist shoulder surfing.

Table 2 shows that in a 48×64 grid, the similarity of 
legal users’ drawings mainly focuses on the range from 
55% to 80%,  while  similarity of attackers’  from 40% 
to 65%. Therefore, in order to keep the system security 
and  not  to  block  the  legal  users,  the  threshold  value 
should  be  certain  value  between  55%  and  80%. 
Another  18  participants  took  part  in  the  second  stage 
experiment. Each person was asked to draw his secret 
six  times,  and  each  time  with  a  different  threshold 
value (from 55% to 80%). The one-time pass through 
validation  and  three-time  pass  through  validation 
numbers  are  recorded  in  Table  3.  At  the  same  time, 
every  participant  was  requested 
to  peek  at  his 
neighbors’  graphical  password  and  attempt  to  attack. 
These  experiments  were  conducted  over  2  days,  and 
the experimental results are shown in Table 3. 
The results illustrated in Table 3 suggest 60% be the 
most suitable threshold value of similarity comparison 
in YAGP, since it can validate the most legal users and 
effectively  resist  shoulder  surfing.  In  conclusion,  a 
48×64 density  grid  and  a  similarity  threshold  of  60% 
are the best choices for our YAGP strategy. 
4.3. Memorability 
to  perform 
they  were  asked 
After the threshold value was determined, the third 
phase experiments were aimed at the memorability of 
YAGP.  Two  days  after  the  participants  had  set  their 
passwords, 
the 
authentication  over  again,  and  given  a  maximum  of 
three  times  to  redraw  their  passwords.  We  had  found 
that  27  out  of  28  graphical  passwords  were  recalled 
successfully.  Two  weeks  later,  15  participants  redrew 
their  passwords  once  again  and  three  chances  were 
permitted.  The  results  showed  that  13  participants 
recalled  the  graphical  passwords  successfully.  The 
experimental  results  showed  a  better  memorability 
performance. 
5. Conclusions and Future Work 
A novel graphical password scheme is proposed in 
this  paper  and  some  preliminary  experiments  are 
carried  out. The  results  show  that  YAGP  achieves  an 
encouraging performance in usability and security and 
possesses a high resistance to shoulder surfing. 
In  a  48×64  grid,  the  secret  drawings  can  be 
described  in  detail.  The  users  can  concentrate  on  the

The  main  drawback  of  YAGP  is  that  it’s  hard  to 
redraw  the  password  precisely.  The  legal  user  cannot 
always  be  assured  to  login  successfully  because  the 
gaps  between  user  drawings  are  uncertain  while  the 
similarity threshold value is fixed. 
Future  research  will  concentrate  on  improving 
YAGP  as  well  as  developing  a  comparison  algorithm 
of  higher  efficiency  in  distinguishing  the  legal  user 
from attackers.

drawing  to  improve  user  experience  because  exact 
positions  are  not  required  in  YAGP.  Meanwhile,  the 
algorithm proposed in YAGP is trend-sensitive  which 
actually  reflects  drawing  trends.  Furthermore,  user 
personalities  have  a  great  influence  on  the  drawings 
and  therefore  make  it  harder  for  others  to  imitate. 
Additionally, users can draw the secrets small enough 
to resist shoulder surfing.
