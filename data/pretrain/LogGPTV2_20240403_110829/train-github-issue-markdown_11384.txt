# Environment
    Windows build number: 10.0.17763.475
    Other software: Elasticsearch 6.7.0 using Java 1.8.0_172, but the behavior was 
    confirmed with a test batch file and executable.
# Steps to reproduce
When testing the functionality of the `start` command within the `cmd.exe`
shell, I found that having the `/min` parameter would affect the `/d`
parameter: the path provided to the `/d` parameter did not seem to be
acknowledged, and the command passed to the `start` command would not be
found.
Test example:
  * Command shell with prompt at `C:\temp`
  * A test batch file at `C:\temp\testdir\test.bat`, with the content
    @echo hello
    pause
  * Running the following command would succeed:  
`C:\temp>start /d c:\temp\testdir test.bat`
  * The following command would not succeed:  
`C:\temp>start /min /d c:\temp\testdir test.bat`
  * If the path is set to `C:\temp\testdir` the following command would succeed:  
`C:\temp\testdir>start /min test.bat`
The use of the `/d` and `/min` parameter together was previously working, and
was required functionality for a commercial product.
I'm wondering if this problem is related to #271 .
# Expected behavior
The `/d` parameter to be parsed when the `/min` parameter is also included to
the `start` command.
# Actual behavior
If the `/min` parameter is used with the `/d` parameter, the path used with
the `/d` parameter does not seem to be used, and the program contained in the
path referenced by the `/d` parameter is not found.
