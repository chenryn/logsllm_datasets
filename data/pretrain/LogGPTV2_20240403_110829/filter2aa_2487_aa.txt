> “I recommend we use scientific curiosity to see what is the physics of the phenomena so many people are describing as UFOs. Ascribing the phenomena to psychological aberrations is nonsense. There is a physical phenomenon that needs explaining. Let’s get on with it in an open-minded, scientifically oriented manner. Then let the data provide the answer.” – Dr. Horace C. Dudley, *New Principles of Quantum Mechanics*, 1959

Fifty years later, similar statements have been made by Peter Sturrock, a physicist at Stanford, and Michael Swords, a professor of history at Western Michigan University, after decades of historical study.

### The Nature of UFOlogy

UFOlogy is a complex blend of:
- Facts
- Suppositions
- Intentional deceptions and disinformation
- Cover stories for classified projects in the sciences and social sciences
- Outright lies by charlatans and scam artists
- A subset of religious experiences and structures in 20th-century America
- Imaginary narratives propagated through various media, which become conflated with memories and other elements in the public consciousness

### Benchmarks for Discussion

To discuss this topic coherently within an hour, we need to establish some benchmarks.

1. **Belief in the Worthiness of the Topic**: When asked about the evidence for UFOs, J. Allen Hynek famously replied, “Where do you want me to stop the truck?” There is a substantial body of evidence, and the burden of proof should be on those who dispute it, not on those who report their observations.

2. **Historical Analysis vs. Scientific Investigation**: This is not a scientific investigation but an historical analysis. Repeatability and testability are not always applicable to historical data, and demanding them selectively is disingenuous.

3. **Official Statements and Media Distortion**: We will reference:
   - Official statements, newspaper accounts, and magazine articles from 1947-1952.
   - The intentional management of the phenomena by government, military, and intelligence agencies.
   - The use of media to distort the phenomena, starting in the early 1950s.
   - Testimonies from credible individuals, such as clergy and Captain Edgar Mitchell of Apollo 14.

### Contextual Considerations

- **Impact of Secrecy and Compartmentalization**: The mutual transparency between the individual and the state has been eroded. The state knows more about the individual, while the individual knows less about the state.
- **Black Budget Research and Development**: The extent of classified research and development, and the application of these technologies to manage public perception.
- **Deception and Psychological Operations (PsyOps)**: The use of illusions, distraction, and ridicule to hide information in plain sight, often through cultural forms like the arts and literature.

### The Bigger Picture

- **Mutual Transparency and Secrecy**: The state's increasing knowledge about individuals, coupled with decreasing transparency, has led to a society where truth is often obscured.
- **Causal Chains and Accountability**: Complex causal chains can evade traditional statistical and other mechanisms, leading to a return to non-rational modes of explanation.
- **Disinformation and Conspiracy Theories**: Outlandish theories about UFOs and government conspiracies are partly a result of disinformation and the impossibility of fully appraising the totality of the data without access to classified information.

### Methodology

A hacker state of mind, characterized by a beginner’s mind and Zen meditation, is essential. Key principles include:
- **Know Yourself**: Distinguish between your mind and the system.
- **Beginner’s Mind**: Approach the data with no preconceived notions.
- **Data-Driven**: Focus on the evidence left behind, track the data meticulously.
- **Intense Concentration and Self-Monitoring**: Be aware of your own biases and patterns.
- **Unlearn Before Learning**: Avoid jumping to conclusions; unlearn stereotypes and preconceptions.

### Challenges and Risks

- **Secondary Trauma**: Engaging in this work can lead to significant mental and emotional strain.
- **Complexity and Intentional Confusion**: The national security state and cultural cold war have created a context of intentional confusion.
- **Compartments and Propaganda**: Compartments and propaganda can lead to a distorted understanding of reality, with beliefs and actions often rationalized post-facto.

### Conclusion

The study of UFOlogy requires a rigorous, open-minded, and data-driven approach. It also demands an awareness of the broader context of secrecy, disinformation, and the impact of these on both individuals and society. By adopting a hacker mindset, we can begin to unravel the complexities and move closer to understanding the true nature of the phenomena.
