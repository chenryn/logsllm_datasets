"And those who were seen dancing were thought to be insane by those 
who could not hear the music."    - Frederick Nietzsche 
“Men will love you if you make them think that they think  
but will hate you if you make them think.”  
“I recommend we use scientific curiosity to see what is the physics of the 
phenomena so many people are describing as UFOs. Ascribing the 
phenomena to psychological aberrations is nonsense. There is a physical 
phenomena that needs explaining. Let’s get on with it in an open-minded 
scientifically oriented manner. Then let the data provide the answer.” – 
written almost 50 years ago by Dr. Horace C. Dudley, New Principles of 
Quantum Mechanics, 1959 - 
Fifty years later, I could make the same statement. So did Peter Sturrock, a 
physicist at Stanford.  So did Michael Swords after decades of historical 
study, a professor of history at Western Michigan University.  
UFOlogy is a blend of facts – suppositions – intentional deceptions and 
disinformation – cover stories for black budget projects in the sciences and 
social sciences – outright boldfaced lies by charlatans, scam artists, and 
flimflam woman and men milking a gullible cow – a subset of religious 
experience and religious structures in 20th century America - and imaginary 
narratives promulgated through magazines, books, television, movies, web 
sites, etc. which become conflated “memories” blended with all of the above 
in the mind of society. 
Hence, the need for a few benchmarks in order to discuss all this for one 
hour in a sane way.  
First, we have to believe it is worthwhile. Hynek was asked, is there 
any evidence for UFOs? He replied, “Where do you want me to stop the 
truck?”  
There is a mountain of evidence. The data is voluminous.  
The burden of proof is on those who would dispute the mountain 
of data, but it has been turned around, putting the burden of proof on 
those who simply report accurately what they saw or what happened to 
them (physical effects). It is like the Swift Boat veterans putting a decorated 
war hero on the defensive while attention on a draft dodging president is 
deflected. (illusion, misdirection, ridicule). 
It is not a scientific investigation but an historical analysis. To ask 
repeatability and testability of historical data for this data but no other is  
disingenuous.  
A general at the Pentagon said to Hynek, “Do you really think we 
would ignore something as significant as this?” 
For purposes of this brief introduction to a very complex subject, we will 
reference the following kinds of historical data: 
(1) official statements, newspaper accounts, magazine articles in the 
seminal period of the “modern era” – 1947- 1952 and a few years 
beyond 1952 in order to document the basic nature of a complex 
phenomenon  and ... 
(2) the intentional management of the phenomena for multiple 
purposes by the government, the military, the intelligence 
community (IC) and others with reference to the early history of 
the CIA and the origins of covert action as a preferred way to 
wage war in the nuclear era  
(3) the use of media to distort the phenomena, which enables us to 
begin mapping the warping of the looking glass in the early 1950s  
(4) testimony from credible people that (a) I know well, in appropriate 
circumstances, with congruent affect and consistent narratives, e.g. 
the Major in the church basement, clergy speaking off the record, 
credible parties such as Captain Edgar Mitchell of Apollo 14   
The context of this conversation includes but is not limited to the following:  
the impact of secrecy on individuals and society 
the impact of compartmentalization on historical research and historical 
understanding  
the extent of black budget research and development and the application of 
technologies and methodologies chartered for use outside our borders to the 
management of perception inside our borders  
the effects of deception/psy ops – through the manufacture and manipulation 
of illusions, sleight of hand to distract the population, and ridicule - above 
all, ridicule, which enables things to be hidden in plain sight ...   
with particular attention to the use of cultural forms such as the arts, 
literature, and other media.  
The Bigger Picture 
The mutual transparency between the individual and the state has been 
destroyed. The state knows ever more about the individual but the 
individual knows less and less about the state. – Sandra Braman, Change 
of State: Information, Policy and Power (The MIT Press: 2006). 
e.g. Vice President Cheney, the obsession with secrecy to frustrate 
transparency and accountability, and the invention of the Vice Presidency as 
a Black Branch of government which is neither executive nor legislative but 
also both. As Alice said, “Words mean exactly what I say that mean, no 
more, no less.” 
speaking to an official NSA historian, I asked: “what can we discuss 
with a realistic sense that we are talking about the same or a similar 
shared history?” 
NSA historian: “Anything that happened up until 1945.”   
Ulrich Beck said in the late 1980s: Causal chains are already so long and 
complex that they often evade perception by existing statistical and other 
mechanisms. As a result, it can be impossible to determine the actual effects 
of the use of complex technologies and to assign accountability for 
undesirable consequences. Beck predicted that in an environment in which 
causality could not be determined, people were likely to return to non-
rational modes of explanation.” (Braman, p. 147) (emphasis mine)  
Or ... “If you once forfeit the confidence of your fellow citizens, you can 
never regain their respect and esteem. It is true that you can fool all of the 
people some of the time; you can ever fool some of the people all of the 
time; but you cannot fool all of the people all of the time.” – Abraham 
Lincoln 
The more outlandish and disconnected theories about UFOs and government 
conspiracies, then, are at least in part direct consequences of disinformation 
– lies and half-truths salted with truths for credibility that constitute a Big 
Lie – and the impossibility for an outsider without access to actual data to 
appraise the totality. 
A corollary:  UFO studies however designed are impossible to do fully and 
accurately outside of black budget realms. We can only pursue them 
partially, with limited data.  But still, there are dots to connect ... 
What does this mean for science? That real science, “outside” the IC and 
black budget R&D, is fragmented through compartmentalization and 
secrecy, so can not be done; it can only be done inside, where DATA i.e. 
FACT is real and aggregated. So only those who direct various projects with 
a maximum of knowledge can direct research and development. This also 
means that it will be done for their purposes, i.e. social control, military 
advantage, informational advantage, the financial reward of collusive 
partners, etc.  
Science as a pursuit of the truth for its own sake – if it ever existed – 
exists no longer.  
Another corollary: the basis of science is the FACT. John Locke introduced 
the concept of the fact - sensory data the interpretation of which can be 
shared and trusted.  
UFO encounters – the real ones – in their essence, are FACTS 
that have been turned into PHANTASMS. As a friend who assists 
political campaigns in a stealthy way said, “you can’t change reality but you 
can change the facts.” 
An experienced pilot says that a circular craft that looked like 
polished aluminum paced his plane and took off at a fantastic speed. He is 
told that it was Venus or meteorological phenomena. He is aghast as a fact 
becomes a phantasm.  
This experience is not emotionally or morally neutral. The 
falsification of a significant event is a betrayal of the social contract.  
Another corollary: inevitably a society of information haves and have-nots 
has evolved. There is little room for an informational middle class because 
big pictures can only conceived in totality or not at all. A part of a big 
picture based on partial knowledge is not a big picture. It is a delusion.  
When a society consists of haves and have nots ... and non-rational 
projections and hypotheses fill the empty spaces in the matrix ... and people 
can believe almost anything and claim to have a case, however fantastic the 
claim ... and when truth is in fact more fantastic than those claims ... then 
that society is ripe for a revolution.  Not a traditional revolution ... not a 
revolution of arms ... but a stealthy revolution of information used 
powerfully, analogous to what real and sophisticated hackers do with 
multiple identities, individual and corporate, in small trusted cells.  
Real hackers, a tiny minority of the vast sea of alleged hackers,  
see the social and political implications of hacking, both as an action 
and in terms of the contents it secures and reveals. They do not see only 
the machinery and the mathematics, they see what it all means for social 
and cultural constructions of reality ... and the future of humanity. 
One question becomes, then, what is the nature, what is the form and 
structure of the revolution that current conditions demand?  
One danger of movies like The Matrix is that people are enabled to 
engage in an imaginary revolution, which manages and diminishes the 
dissonance they feel by having their intuitions and perceptions made visible, 
then transcended. This is analogous to the “fear and pity” which Aristotle 
said characterized tragedy – spectators fear for persons like themselves, but 
purge that fear through pity in the resolution of the tragic dilemma.  
Hence, movies, books, multi-payer online games, narratives of all 
kinds, can be means for diminishing anxiety, managing cognitive 
dissonance, and rendering the population stable and supportive of the status 
quo.  
Unfortunately, such a society creates its own enemies by rendering the 
unthinkable thinkable. e.g., Operation Northwoods means that 9/11 as a 
deliberate plot by elected officials is thinkable.  The toppling of Saddam’s 
statue as a staged event means that the idea that we did not land on the moon 
but enacted the deception on a sound stage is thinkable.  
In an environment in which causality can not be determined, people are 
likely to turn to non-rational modes of explanation. 
All of this is preamble and relevant to the subject.  
What methodology is required, then? A hacker state of mind.  
Beginner’s mind, Zen mind.  
A methodology or model from information security and profiling, which is 
outlined by paraphrasing an experienced, CIA profiler ... who said: 
Profiling like chasing black hat bad guy hackers raises some of the same 
issues: 
To know who is the enemy you must KNOW YOURSELF. 
Zen meditation helps distinguish between mind and system. 
Warnings and indicators –look with a beginner’s mind – with no 
preconceived notions. “THE DATA WILL TELL ME WHAT I NEED TO 
KNOW.”  Whether hackers or serial killers. The stereotype, any 
preconceived notion, such as “a young male hacker,” must be disregarded. 
There is no template in particular cases but people still bring preconceptions 
to the case. Like the DC sniper. The mind imposes patterns automatically. 
Network patterns – data – revealing a series of behaviors => leads to 
hackers. Usual conceptualizations of the problem are far too narrow and 
unsophisticated when you watch a good hacker. E. g. as Matt Blaze said, 
“the weakest link in the security chain is the definition of the problem - and 
the real definition of the problem is frequently not the definition that people 
work with.” 
For Infosec the customary approach, then, is sophomoric. Only the 
data will tell you what they are doing, what they left behind. Focus on the 
evidence they leave. What were they after? => track the data. be meticulous. 
Covering tracks completely is rare. There is always a m.o. of a person 
entering a system, whether a house or a computer network – unconscious or 
conscious, patterns and identity will reveal itself.  
The work requires: INTENSE CONCENTRATION AND 
CONSTANT SELF-MONITORING. There are a thousand puzzle pieces and 
no box with a picture. The degree of CLARITY required is great. “If I had a 
stereotype in mind, I always blew it. I LEARNED NOT TO FORM A 
PATTERN TOO QUICKLY.”  
Exactly the opposite – the popular conception of the profiler as 
someone who leaps to a conclusion is WRONG. We have to UNLEARN 
before we can learn, like the Zen cup story. 
Observe yourself => notice yourself jumping to a conclusion in 
thought or word => once you see that, say: wait! stop! interrupt and back 
track. 
Ask: is this REALLY true? or does it only seem or feel true? 
Ask: how do you feel about thinking that way? Stop yourself from 
completing the loop too quickly.  Look at your self and ask: who am I to 
know that, think that – without sufficient data?  
In pursuit of INSIDERS – look for the one WHO DOES NOT FIT 
THE PATTERN. 
This m.o. is also appropriate to the study of UFOlogy.  
A danger of doing this work or any spooky work is SECONDARY 
TRAUMA 
“HOW TO LIVE IN A WORLD WITHOUT WALLS” 
the story of the IC professional who lost his self, his identity, in the 
process of doing his work. The high degree of mental illness in the IC. How 
it is handled inside and the disconnect with the real process of healing.  
some of the difficulties in UFOlogy:  
complexity (Bill Gates’ commencement address, Bruce Schneier) is real 
intentional confusion

The Cultural Cold War by Stonor – the entire context of my life was 
bent. Stephen Spender, my teacher, and his magazine, Encounter, a CIA 
operation from start to finish. And publishing. And abstract art. 
“The Cultural Cold War” – 1000+ books, publishing, influence, journalists – 
what does this MEAN for the assumed CONTEXT? 
magazines, books, publishing, abstract modern art – Steinbeck 
remember the historian at NSA – we can discuss only shared 
assumptions to 1945. 
how bad is it? ... ? well, we don’t know what we don’t know but we 
know we don’t know.  
how did Fodor’s begin? 
insurance companies – a conversation with a CEO 
The devil in Woody Allen’s Deconstructing Harry, "Sometimes 
you’re up, sometimes down. In the end, the house always wins. It doesn't 
mean you didn't have fun." 
The effects of COMPARTMENTALIZATION: 
e.g. JFK autopsy: “it was the damndest thing ... “ projection onto blank 
spaces. 
A friend reports his psy ops briefing, thirteen stories down, underground, at 
an AFB base -  “that’s exactly what we want people to believe” 
The purpose of propaganda (Joseph Goebbels: “Entertainment is the 
best form of propaganda.”) and psy ops is for people to believe they have 
chosen to act as they do for reasons that are their own, when in fact they are 
not. Beliefs are also a behavior, a mental activity, every bit as much as other 
physical actions. Beliefs are actions, because they frame how we will act, 
what we will do, and what we believe about why we did what we do. Studies 
show that people act, then invent reasons for why they acted which are 
rationalizations, e.g. after hypnosis. Actions are for unconscious reasons, 
conscious processes often make things seem smooth, intelligible, safe. Fuzzy 
logic distorting the truth of our lives.  
If you determine the questions people ask, you don’t have to worry 
about the answers.

the antidote: Mutuality, Feedback, Accountability – all three must be there. 
UFOs and UFOlogy  
why is UFOlogy, virtually alone of all interesting areas, NOT STUDIED? 
at least under social sciences, as studies of delusion, misperception? 
because the more one studies the data, the more one realizes there are many 
credible cases. The nature of the inquiry changes. One moves through a
