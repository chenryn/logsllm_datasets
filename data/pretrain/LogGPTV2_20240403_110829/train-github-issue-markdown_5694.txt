  * I tried using the `@types/angular` with `@types/angular-mocks` package and had problems.
  * I tried using the latest stable version of tsc. https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript
Package | Version  
---|---  
`typescript` | 2.4.2  
`@types/angular` | 1.6.28  
`@types/angular-mocks` | 1.5.10  
Hello,
Since I upgraded `@types/angular` package I have a problem with compilation.
I'm getting following error when I try to run the test:
    error TS2339: Property 'mock' does not exist on type 'IAngularStatic'.
The problem exists not only with `@types/angular-mock` but also angular-
bootstrap, angular-growl-v2, etc. In short, everything that has an `angular.`
prefix in definition files.
I've found similar issues within this repo's page but none of the solutions or
workarounds works.
