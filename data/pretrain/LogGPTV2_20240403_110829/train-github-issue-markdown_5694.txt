Subject: Compilation Issues with `@types/angular` and Related Packages

Hello,

I recently upgraded the `@types/angular` package, and since then, I have encountered issues during the compilation process. Specifically, when attempting to run tests, I receive the following error:

```
error TS2339: Property 'mock' does not exist on type 'IAngularStatic'.
```

This issue is not limited to `@types/angular-mocks` but also affects other packages such as `angular-bootstrap`, `angular-growl-v2`, and any others that use the `angular.` prefix in their definition files.

Here are the versions of the relevant packages I am using:

| Package                | Version  |
|------------------------|----------|
| `typescript`           | 2.4.2    |
| `@types/angular`       | 1.6.28   |
| `@types/angular-mocks` | 1.5.10   |

I have reviewed similar issues on the repository's page, but none of the suggested solutions or workarounds have resolved the problem.

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,
