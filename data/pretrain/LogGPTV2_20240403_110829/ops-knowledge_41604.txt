User: I have some small utility scripts written in Python that I want to be usable on both Windows and Linux.  I want to avoid having to explicitly invoke the Python interpreter.  Is there an easy way to point shebang notation to the correct locations on both Windows and Linux?  If not, is there another way to allow implicit invocation of the Python interpreter on both Windows and Linux without having to modify the script when transferring between operating systems?
Edit:  The shebang support on Windows is provided Cygwin, but I want to use the native Windows Python interpreter on Windows, not the Cygwin one. 
Edit # 2:  It appears that shebang notation overrides file associations in Cygwin terminals.  I guess I could just uninstall Cygwin Python and symlink /usr/bin/python to Windows-native Python.
Assistant: Install pywin32. One of the nice thing is it setups the file association of *.py to the python interpreter.
