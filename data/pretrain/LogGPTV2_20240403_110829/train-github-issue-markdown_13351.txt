  * Add `__inverse__` to Index.
  * Change duplicated to return np.array (PR #9112)
Related to #7979
Because `Index` is no more the subclass of `np.array`, `Index.duplicated`
returns `Index` with `dtype=object`. And `Index` don't accepts logical not.
    idx = pd.Index([1, 2, 1, 3])
    idx.duplicated()
    # Index([False, False, True, False], dtype='object')
    ~idx.duplicated()
    # TypeError: bad operand type for unary ~: 'Index'
As a result, it is impossible to drop data which have duplicated index using
expression like `df[~df.index.duplicated()]`. This expression was worked at
the timing of #7979.
Does `Index.duplicated` should return `np.array` with `dtype=bool`? Or `Index`
should accept logical not?
