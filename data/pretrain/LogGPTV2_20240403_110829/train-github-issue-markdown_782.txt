It seems like using glob on `use` statements ends up generating twice the
documentation for `Impl` and `Traits` of this `Struct`.
If I use:
    pub use foo::bar::*;
All `Impl` and `Traits` of each `Struct` in `foo::bar::*` will be duplicated
in the doc.  
If symbols are listed one by one it works well:
    pub use foo::bar::baz;
    pub use foo::bar::boz;
Issue can be seen when generating the doc from

If you change in `src/lib.rs`:
    pub use self::cpu::*;
by
    pub use self::cpu::Cpu;
    pub use self::cpu::Flag;
it will work.
