I am currently using Firefox 22.0 and Chrome 27.0.1453.110. When I visit the following page: http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/getting-started/, I have noticed a discrepancy in the behavior of the sidebar navigation between the two browsers.

In Chrome, when I click on "License FAQs" in the sidebar, the page automatically scrolls to the corresponding section, as it did in the previous version of Bootstrap. However, in Firefox, clicking on the same menu item does not produce any effect, and the page does not scroll to the "License FAQs" section.

Is this issue specific to the documentation page, or is it related to the Bootstrap library itself?
