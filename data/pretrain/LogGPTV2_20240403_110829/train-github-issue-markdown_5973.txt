I am using FireFox 22.0 and Chrome 27.0.1453.110.
For example, in this page, http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/getting-started/
If I hit "License FAQs" on the sidebar in Chrome, the page will directly
scroll to the corresponding section for me, just like in the previous version
of Bootstrap.
However if I do this in FireFox, the click on the menu has no effect and the
page won't scroll to the "License FAQs" section.
Is this an issue of the documentation page only or the library itself?
