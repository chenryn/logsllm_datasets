User: I saw there are two methods for getting data from the datastore:
fetch() and run()
Regarding fetch the documentation says:
Note: You should rarely need to use this method; it is almost always better to use run() instead.
I don't understand the difference between the two.
I am new to GAE and Python, please help me understand.
Thanks
It says that run() is asynchronous which I don't understand cause unlike JavaScript, once you run the Python script for the site, the html is frozen, right?
Assistant: Beginner's advice: until you appreciate the difference, stick with fetch().  There are many other things you probably ought to get comfortable with first before this subtle distinction will bother you.
