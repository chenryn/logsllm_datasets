### Issue Reproduction and Log Analysis

**Reproduction Steps:**

1. Create a new list containing approximately 100 images.
2. Start the activity and remain at the top of the list. Observe that the top images load quickly.
3. Quickly scroll to the very bottom of the list.
4. Wait for the last few images to load. This process takes about one minute for the 4 images currently in view.

**Note:** This issue only occurs when using `OkHttpUrlLoader`.

**Logcat Output:**

```

```

**Analysis:**

The logcat output indicates that the `GenericRequest` is taking an unusually long time (approximately 61 seconds) to load the resource. The initial setup and readiness checks are completed quickly, but the actual resource loading is significantly delayed.

**Possible Causes:**

1. **Request Backlog:** There might be a backlog of requests, causing delays in processing.
2. **Cancellation Issues:** Requests may not be being cancelled correctly, leading to a buildup of pending requests.
3. **Network or Server Issues:** The delay could be due to network latency or server-side issues.

**Next Steps:**

1. **Check Request Management:** Ensure that requests are being managed and cancelled properly. Verify if there are any issues with request cancellation or if too many requests are being queued.
2. **Network Diagnostics:** Perform network diagnostics to check for any latency or server-side issues.
3. **Code Review:** Review the code related to `OkHttpUrlLoader` and `GenericRequest` to identify any potential bottlenecks or misconfigurations.

If you have any further insights or suggestions on where to start looking, it would be greatly appreciated.
