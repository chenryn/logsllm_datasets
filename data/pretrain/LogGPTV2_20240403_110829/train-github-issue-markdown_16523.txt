The easiest way to repro this is with a brand new list of ~100 images. Start
the activity, stay at the top of the list, see the top images load quickly.
Then quickly scroll to the very bottom of the list and wait for the last few
images to load. This takes about a minute for the 4 images in view to load.
This only reproduces when using OkHttpUrlLoader.

Seems like maybe requests are backed up or something? Not being cancelled
correctly? If you have any thoughts to what might be going on or some pointers
about where to start looking myself that'd be greatly appreciated.
Thanks.
