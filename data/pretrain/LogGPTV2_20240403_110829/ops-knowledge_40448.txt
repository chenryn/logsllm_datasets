User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题MySQL Master-Master with offsets getting ERROR 1872 I'm trying to fix the replication between a master-master MySQL database replication model.

Server 1 (with the IP of 192.168.2.6) is configured with:

auto-increment-increment       = 2
auto-increment-offset          = 1


So it writes only odd primary key auto-incrementing IDs.

Server 2 (with the IP of 192.168.2.7) is configured with:

auto-increment-increment       = 2
auto-increment-offset          = 2


So it writes only even primary key auto-incrementing IDs.

I've been told that this was working for some time, but since I've been hired, it has been in failure to sync status. I'm operating under the assumption that this is possible.

My job is to get it working in this manner. I've done the following steps to try to get them to sync:

Server 1:
    mysql&gt;
    RESET MASTER;
    # First time only:
    #GRANT REPLICATE SLAVE ON *.* TO 'replicate'@192.168.2.7 IDENTIFIED BY '[password_redacted]';
    #FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
    FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK;
    SHOW MASTER STATUS;

    bash#
    mysqldump -u root -p -ceQRE --hex-blob --triggers --opt --single-transaction --comments --dump-date --no-autocommit --all-databases -r /root/master.sql
    scp -P 5934 /root/master.sql root@192.168.2.7:.

    mysql&gt;
    UNLOCK TABLES;

Server 2:
    mysql&gt;
    STOP SLAVE;

    bash#
    mysql -u root -p &lt; /root/master.sql

    mysql&gt;
    # First time only:
    #GRANT REPLICATE SLAVE ON *.* TO 'replicate'@192.168.2.6 IDENTIFIED BY '[password_redacted]';
    #FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
    RESET SLAVE;
    CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_HOST='192.168.2.6', MASTER_USER='replicate', MASTER_PASSWORD='[password_redacted]', MASTER_LOG_FILE='ibm.000001', MASTER_LOG_POS=28556380;
    START SLAVE;
    SHOW SLAVE STATUS\G

Server 1:
    mysql&gt;
    STOP SLAVE;
    CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_HOST='192.168.2.7', MASTER_USER='replicate', MASTER_PASSWORD='[password_redacted]', MASTER_LOG_FILE='ibm.000004', MASTER_LOG_POS=121875;
    CHANGE REPLICATION FILTER REPLICATE_DO_DB = (reminderdental2), REPLICATE_IGNORE_DB = (mysql);
    START SLAVE;


Each time it says it syncronizing but the row counts never come into conformity. After some time, I'll get the error:

Slave SQL for channel '': Slave failed to initialize relay log info structure from the repository, Error_code: 1872
ERROR 1872 (HY000): Slave failed to initialize relay log info structure from the repository


I've also tryed Percona XtraBackup to get a binary-backup/restore in order to kick it off the first time.

I've considered moving to GTID replication but have heard the performance is not as good. I'm interested in both solutions to get it working in this way as well as feedback regarding performance of a 2-9 server cluster using GTID.

Server 1's version is:

5.7.21-0ubuntu0.16.04.1-log (Ubuntu)
percona-xtrabackup-24/unknown,now 2.4.9-1.xenial amd64 [installed]


Serer 2's version is:

5.7.21-log MySQL Community Server (GPL)
percona-xtrabackup-24, 2.4.9.1.el7

Assistant: On MySQL > 6 you should use also

mysql&gt; STOP SLAVE;
mysql&gt; RESET SLAVE ALL;


Should be the same, but using documented command is better than tweaking into system tables. See also https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/reset-slave.html
