membarrier.2
    mathieu desnoyers
        update example to take tso into account
            the existing example given specifically states that it focus on
            x86 (tso memory model), but gives a read-read vs write-write
            ordering example, even though this scenario does not require
            explicit barriers on tso.
            so either we change the example architecture to a weakly-ordered
            architecture, or we change the example to a scenario requiring
            barriers on x86.
            let's stay on x86, but provide a dekker as example instead.
    mathieu desnoyers
            adapt the membarrier_cmd_shared return value documentation to
            reflect that it now returns -einval when issued on a system

mremap.2
    mike kravetz  [florian weimer, jann horn]
        add description of old_size == 0 functionality
            since at least the 2.6 time frame, mremap() would create a new
            mapping of the same pages if 'old_size == 0'.  it would also leave
            the original mapping.  this was used to create a 'duplicate
            mapping'.
            a recent change was made to mremap() so that an attempt to create a
            duplicate a private mapping will fail.
    michael kerrisk  [michal hocko, mike kravetz]
        bugs: describe older behavior for old_size==0 on private mappings

            for old_size==0 with shared mappings.

open.2
    michael kerrisk
        by contrast with o_rdonly, no file permissions are required for o_path
            note one of the significant advantages of o_path: many of the
            operations applied to o_path file descriptors don't require
            read permission, so there's no reason why the open() itself
            should require read permission.
    michael kerrisk
        note use of o_path to provide o_exec functionality
    michael kerrisk

        fix bogus description of reboot() from non-initial pid namespace
            the current text was confused (mea culpa). no signal is sent to
            the init() process. rather, depending on the 'cmd' given to
            reboot(), the 'group_exit_code' value will set to either sighup or
            sigint, with the effect that one of those signals is reported to
            wait() in the parent process.

seccomp.2
    michael kerrisk  [adhemerval zanella, florian weimer, kees cook]
        add some caveats regarding the use of seccomp filters
    michael kerrisk
        document the "default" filter return action
            the kernel defaults to either seccomp_ret_kill_process
            or seccomp_ret_kill_thread for unrecognized filter
            return action values.
    michael kerrisk  [kees cook]
        change seccomp_ret_action to seccomp_ret_action_full
            in linux 4.14, the action component of the return value
            switched from being 15 bits to being 16 bits. a new macro,
            seccomp_ret_action_full, that masks the 16 bits was added,
            to replace the older seccomp_ret_action.

splice.2
    michael kerrisk
        since linux 2.6.31,'fd_in' and 'fd_out' may both refer to pipes
stat.2
    michael kerrisk  [richard knutsson]
        use lstat() instead of stat()
            it's more logical to use lstat() in the example code,
            since one can then experiment with symbolic links, and
            also the s_iflnk case can also occur.
    neilbrown
        correct at_no_automount text and general revisions
            expand on the relationship between fstatat() and the other three
            functions, and improve the description of at_no_automount.
            specifically, both  stat() and lstat() act the same way with
            respect to automounts, and that behavior matches fstatat() with
            the at_no_automount flag.

            add notes to this effect, and also add detail about enospc and

            in particular.

    michael kerrisk  [walter harms]
        note the use of perror(3) and strerror(3)
    michael kerrisk
        recast the advice against manually declaring 'errno'
            recast the advice against manually declaring 'errno' to
            a more modern perspective. it's 13 years since the original
            text was added, and even then it was describing old behavior.
            cast the description to be about behavior further away in
            time, and note more clearly that manual declaration will
            cause problems with modern c libraries.
    michael kerrisk
        add some missing errors
    michael kerrisk
        error numbers are positive values (rather than nonzero values)
            posix.1-2008 noted the explicitly the change (to align with
            the c standards) that error numbers are positive, rather
            than nonzero.
    michael kerrisk
        reorganize the text and add some subheadings
            restructure the text and add some subheadings for better
            readability. no (intentional) content changes.
    michael kerrisk  [wesley aptekar-cassels]
        note that error numbers vary somewhat across architectures
            added after a patch from wesley aptekar-cassels that proposed
            to add error numbers to the text.

            as reported by rahul, the existing sentence could be read as
