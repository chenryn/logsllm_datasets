First of all, sorry if it's not a bug, but it's worth creating an issue;
I've noticed that the profiler never shows the information about my pools in
the right Request.
**Facts** :
  * The cache call are made on the main request.
  * Inside app, the menu is rendered via a `{{ render(controller(...)) }}` call so it triggers 1 subrequest. **No cache calls were made on that subrequest**.
After spending some time on understanding what was happening, I discovered
that the data is showing on the profiler of the **SUB REQUEST instead of the
request itself**.
**to reproduce:** https://github.com/tristanbes/symfony-cache-profiler-bug

## cache pannel, where it should appear since the call were made on this
request

## cache pannel of the subrequest, where **no cache calls were made**
