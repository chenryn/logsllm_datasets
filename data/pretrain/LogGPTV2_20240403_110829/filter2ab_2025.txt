### ATT&CK ID: T1070.002
### ATT&CK Technique Name: Clear Linux or Mac System Logs

Adversaries may clear system logs to conceal evidence of their intrusion. Both macOS and Linux maintain records of system and user-initiated actions through system logs, which are primarily stored in the `/var/log/` directory. This directory contains subfolders that categorize logs based on their specific functions, such as:

- **System Logs**: General system events and kernel messages.
- **Authentication Logs**: Login and logout activities, including failed login attempts.
- **Application Logs**: Logs generated by various applications and services.
- **Security Logs**: Security-related events, such as changes to user accounts and file permissions.

By clearing these logs, adversaries can make it more difficult for security analysts and forensic investigators to detect and trace their activities.
