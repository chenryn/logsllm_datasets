reality

Abstract The Semantic Web vision has drove hundreds of practitioners to re-
search and develop a new bread of applications that could take the full potential of
the Web to the next level. While there is a fairly clear understanding of where
Web 1.0 and Web 2.0 stand now a day, the current status and position of the Se-
mantic Web, also known as Web 3.0, is not as clear and well defined. Therefore,
in this paper we present a landscape that illustrates and captures the trends in the
Semantic Web with the purpose of guiding future developments.
1. Introduction
The vision for a Semantic Web has been termed as The Next Big Thing for infor-
mation system. The publication of the Scientific American Magazine article “The
Semantic Web” in May, 2001, by Tim Berners-Lee, James Hendler and Ora
Lassila has triggered a strong wave of research worldwide. Thousands of research
papers have been written and hundreds of applications have been implemented.
But what are the research trends. That is what we will address in this paper by pre-
senting a summary of a survey (Cardoso, 2007) to gives an account of current Se-
mantic Web practices. The findings reported in this article are based on 627 sur-
veys that were filled in and conducted from 12 December 2006 to 26 January
2007.
2. Web.X – A story in 3 chapters
The Semantic Web has been coined Web 3.0. While previous Web technologies,
such as Web 1.0 and Web 2.0, had a remarkable success, there is no consensus
that Web 3.0 had, or will have in the future, the same levels of success. While
some researchers believe that the Web 3.0 is still to come to delight users and take
2
them to a new paradigm, others believe that it has been such as long time since the
Semantic Web vision was introduced that it is becoming almost mythical.
The Web 1.0 classifies the very first applications for the Web which had the
main objective to only provide information content to end users. Web 2.0 brought
interactivity to users. Features such as tagging, social networks, online media,
content aggregation and syndication (RSS), mashups and folksonomies became
common on the Web.
Web 1.0 and Web 2.0 successes are undeniable. Success stories are available at
the distance of a mouse click. Web 1.0 has deliver innovative solutions such as
DoubleClick, mp3.com, Britannica Online, personal websites, screen scraping,
and content management systems. Web 2.0 has engineered landmarks such as
Google AdSense, Flickr, BitTorrent, Napster, Wikipedia, and del.icio.us.
But what about the Web 3.0? When will the Semantic Web arrive? The build-
ing blocks are already available: RDF, OWL, and microformats are a few of them.
During the 2007 Semantic Technology Conference, several new and robust start-
ups companies based on – Semantic Web technologies – have demonstrated their
interest and commitment to this new concept for their business. But while it seems
that we getting close to deliver the promised automated applications, we are still a
few years away from unleashing the killer-app. Interesting companies that are ac-
tively trying to implement the Semantic Web include Twine, Garlik, and Hakia.
Twine is a real application of the Semantic Web that gives users a superior way to
share, organize, and find information with people they trust. It uses the Semantic
Web, natural language processing, and machine learning to make your information
and relationships more expressive. Garlik is using Semantic Web technologies to
help users monitor their personal information online and protect themselves
against identity theft. Hakia is a semantic search engines with a focus on natural
language processing methods to try and deliver search results based on analyzing
semantics and not keywords.
According to Google search engine, the number of queries for “Semantic Web”
keywords has dropped since 2004. Figure 1 shows a trend in Semantic Web popu-
larity. What does this empirical trend represented the semantic research field?

On the one hand, this can be explained by the fact that the hype is fading away and
that people are losing interested in Semantic Web solutions. On the other hand, it
can be explained by the fact that the concept is already accepted and understood
by many people and, therefore, it does not need to be searched for. To better un-
derstand the current research and industrial efforts to make the Semantic Web a
reality, and not a mythical story, we have carried out a survey in 2006 and 2007.
The results are summarized in the following section.
3. Current trends of the Semantic Web
The survey carried out was divided into five categories: Demographics, Tools and
Languages, Ontology, Ontology Size, and Production. The complete results of the
survey can be found at (Cardoso, 2007) and are here presented as a summary of
the most interesting points.
Ontology Editors. We asked respondents to tell us which ontology editors they
were currently using in their organizations. The editor most frequently cited was
Protégé with a market share of 68.2%. Approximately equal numbers of respon-
dents use SWOOP (13.6%), OntoEdit (12.2%) (OntoEdit is now called OntoStu-
dio), and Altova SemanticWorks (10.3%). A good survey of the most popular on-
tology editors can be found in (Escórcio and Cardoso, 07).
Ontology Languages. Our study revealed more than 75% of ontologists have se-
lected OWL to develop their ontologies and that more than 64% rely on RDF(S).
Curiously, Description Logic and FLogic are also being used with a penetration
rate of 17% and 11.8%, respectively. A recent language, WSML (Web Service
Modeling Language), has also gained some popularity (3.7%).
Reasoning Engines. We asked all respondents to indicate the reasoning engines
they were using. The largest segment (53.6%) indicated that they were using Jena
(McBride, 2002). Smaller groups indicated they were using Racer (28%) and Pel-
let (23.7%). FaCT++ (13.3%) and OWLJessKB (8.1%) have also gained prefer-
ence by a small group of participants.
Ontology Domains. To determine the actual trend in the development of ontolo-
gies for particular domains, we asked all respondents to indicate for which indus-
tries they were representing knowledge with ontologies. Education and Computer
Software are the best represented industries (31% and 28.5%), followed by Gov-
ernment (17%) and Business Services (17%).
Methodologies. We asked all respondents to indicate which methodology or
method they were employing to develop their ontologies. Sixty percent develop
4
ontologies without using any methodology. The methodologies with greatest
adoption are METHONTOLOGY (13.7%) followed by On-To-Knowledge meth-
odology (7.4%) and Uschold and King’s method (4.2%).
Purpose of using ontologies.We asked participants to tell us the reasons that mo-
tivated them to use ontologies. The vast majority of participants (69.9%) answered
“to share common understanding of the structure of information among people or
software agents, so models can be understood by humans and computers”.
Techniques used with ontologies. We asked respondents to tell us if they used
any specific technique to manipulate ontologies. The largest segment of respon-
dents (67.1%) indicated that they use ontology mapping. Roughly equal numbers
of participants indicated that they were integrating ontologies (40.7%) and merg-
ing ontologies (33.9%). Twenty six percent stated that they align ontologies.
Ontologies size. We asked each respondent to indicate the average size of the
smallest, typical, and biggest ontologies they were working with. A vast majority
of respondents (72.9%) indicated that their smallest ontologies had less than 100
concepts. When asked about typical ontologies, forty four percent of respondents
stated that such types of ontology had between 100 and 1000 concepts.
Production. Each respondent was asked to indicate if they would put their sys-
tems into production. More that 70% of all respondents indicated that they
planned to adopt ontology-based systems, while 27.9% indicate that they do not
have any plans to use such types of systems in the future.
4. Conclusions
Web 1.0 and Web 2.0 had, and still have, an important impact on society and elec-
tronic commerce. The next step for the evolution of the Web is the Semantic Web,
or Web 3.0. The information presented in this article constitutes a checkpoint to
frame the current status and trends in the Semantic Web. It depicts a paradigm
change from an idea to the development and use of real and concrete semantic so-
lutions.
