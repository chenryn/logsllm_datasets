User: I have a python script that I want to package as a Mac application bundle with py2app. That script calls a CLI executable.
How do I embed that executable in the application bundle?
I tried to edit setup.py in order to include it as a Resource but in that case, execution privileges are lost. Moreover the strip stage of py2app raises an error. I wonder if there is a specific setup.py option that could copy the executable in Content/MacOS instead of Content/Resources.
Assistant: Adding the CLI executable to the resources it the correct way to do it, but that doesn't work due to a bug in py2app (the file permissions aren't copied at the moment).
The easiest workaround is to reset the file permissions after calling py2app.
