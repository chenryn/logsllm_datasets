**ATT&CK ID:** T1098.005  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Device Registration

Adversaries may register a device to an adversary-controlled account. This can occur in two primary contexts:

1. **Multifactor Authentication (MFA) Systems:** Devices may be registered within MFA systems, which are responsible for managing authentication processes and granting access to the network.
   
2. **Device Management Systems:** Devices may also be registered in device management systems, which handle device access, compliance, and other administrative functions.

By registering a device in these systems, adversaries can gain unauthorized access or maintain persistence within the target environment.
