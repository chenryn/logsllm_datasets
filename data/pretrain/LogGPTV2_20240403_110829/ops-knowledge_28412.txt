I am new to CentOS and am trying to set up an application on it. My application requires Python 2.7, but the default version on the server is Python 2.6. In an attempt to upgrade, I accidentally deleted the `/usr/bin/python` folder. After that, I installed Python 2.7 using `make install`. I then recreated the `/usr/bin/python` folder and ran the command `sudo ln -s /usr/bin/python2.7 /usr/bin/python`.

However, after this, when I try to run YUM commands, I encounter the following error:
```
-bash: /usr/bin/yum: /usr/bin/python: bad interpreter: Permission denied
```

The permissions for the `/usr/bin/python` directory are as follows:
```
drwxrwxrwx 2 root root 4096 Mar  8 00:19 python
```

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. Remove the existing Python installation:
   ```sh
   sudo rpm -e python
   ```

2. Check which package is responsible for the current Python installation:
   ```sh
   sudo rpm -q python
   ```

3. Reinstall the Python package:
   ```sh
   sudo yum install python*
   ```

This should resolve the problem.
