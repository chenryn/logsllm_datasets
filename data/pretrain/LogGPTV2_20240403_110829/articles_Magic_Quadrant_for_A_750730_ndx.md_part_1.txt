■ Summary Translation: Magic Quadrant for Application Performance Monitoring and
Observability
(25 July 2022)
Market Definition/Description
Gartner’s view is focused on transformational technologies or approaches delivering on
the future needs of end users. It is not focused on the market as it is today.
Gartner defines the application performance monitoring (APM) and observability market
as software that enables the observation and analysis of application health, performance
and user experience. The targeted roles are IT operations, site reliability engineers, cloud
and platform ops, application developers, and product owners. These solutions may be
offered for self-hosted deployments; as vendor-managed, hosted environments; or via
software as a service (SaaS).
The capabilities of APM and observability tools include:

■ The observation of an application’s complete transactional behavior
■ Automated discovery and mapping of an application and its infrastructure
components (including cloud services)
■ Monitoring of applications running on mobile (native and browser) and desktop
browsers
■ Identification and analysis of application performance problems and their impact on
business outcomes
■ Native integration capabilities with automation and service management tools, as
well as native integration with public cloud providers — e.g., Amazon Web Services
(AWS) Cloudwatch, Azure Monitoring and Google Cloud Operations
■ Analysis of business key performance indicators (KPIs) and user journeys — for
example, login to check-out
■ The ability to perform interactive interrogation of multiple telemetry types (such as
traces, metrics and logs) to detect “unknown unknowns” — that is, the ability to
identify underlying issues to unexpected events and gaps in telemetry coverage
■ Application security functionality delivered via a common agent or framework for
APM
Optional functionality may include:
■ Endpoint monitoring to understand the user experience and its impact on business
outcomes
■ Support for virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) monitoring
■ Performance testing and integration with load testing tools

Vendor Strengths and Cautions
Alibaba Cloud
Alibaba Cloud is a Niche Player in this Magic Quadrant. Its Application Real-Time
Monitoring Service (ARMS), Cloud Monitor and Log Service products are primarily
designed to run as SaaS subscriptions on the Alibaba Cloud platform, although on-
premises options are available for large clients. Its operations are mostly focused in China
and the Asia/Pacific (APAC) region, with a smaller number of deployments of Alibaba
Cloud in Europe and North America. The company plans continued integration with
DevOps tools; advancement of Alibaba Cloud in Europe, the Middle East and Africa
(EMEA); and enhancement of its artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities for digital
experience monitoring (DEM). Its clients are primarily large enterprises in China, with an
increasing focus on small or midsize businesses (SMBs).
Strengths
■ Completeness of solution: For clients deploying on Alibaba Cloud, the native tools
provide many of the core requirements of a monitoring solution, without the
requirement to implement a third-party solution.
■ Strong ecosystem: Like many other hyperscalers, Alibaba cloud has a strong
portfolio of adjacent offerings, such as analytics, as well as tight integration with
tools such as DingTalk for collaboration.
■ Pricing: Implementing Alibaba APM monitoring is cost-effective, compared with
implementing a third-party tool on Alibaba cloud.
Cautions
■ Worldwide traction: Political tensions, perceived security concerns and other
nontechnical issues will continue to inhibit the uptake of Alibaba Cloud, especially in
North America and Europe. This will limit clients’ ability to access the technology
globally.
■ Support: Global support options for Alibaba are primarily centered in China, and are
limited outside the APAC region.
■ Platform: On-premises deployments exist, but they rely on customized
implementation efforts. SaaS deployments with native integration are provided to
the Alibaba Cloud ecosystem, whereas manual installations are needed for
applications from other cloud providers.

Amazon Web Services
Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a Challenger in this Magic Quadrant. Its APM and
observability solution, which comprises Amazon CloudWatch, AWS X-Ray, Amazon
CodeGuru and Amazon DevOps Guru, enables APM and observability use cases. However,
it is not packaged explicitly as APM. Its operations are geographically diversified, and its
customers tend to be large enterprises. Although roadmap information for Amazon
Cloudwatch and the rest of its APM and observability services was not available, AWS
releases product updates regularly. Examples from April 2022 include some new
capabilities, such as Amazon CloudWatch Metrics Insights and Amazon CloudWatch
Metric Streams.
Strengths
■ AWS-native implementation: In most cases, AWS resources store telemetry data in
Amazon CloudWatch automatically. It is a natural focal point for analyzing the
health, performance and efficiency of workloads deployed to AWS. AWS continually
updates these services based on customer feedback.
■ Geographic footprint: Amazon CloudWatch is part of every AWS region. AWS X-Ray,
Amazon DevOps Guru and Amazon CodeGuru are widely available. Organizations
that are concerned about both capabilities and data sovereignty will find this
particularly beneficial.
■ AWS toolchain integration: These AWS services not only work well together, they
integrate well with other AWS services. For example, Amazon CloudWatch Evidently
supports the automated rollback of underperforming or defective software releases
via release pipeline based on behavior triggers.
Cautions
■ Implementation and usage complexity: With the number of discrete services
involved, using AWS-native tools for APM and observability requires a learning curve
investment that not every organization may be willing to make. However, given the
range of third-party solutions that support AWS-hosted workloads, teams that
struggle with CloudWatch have options.
■ Varying multicloud support: The AWS APM and observability tools prioritize support
for workloads hosted on AWS platforms, hybrid/on-premises workloads and on the
edge. Support for other vendor ecosystems is on par with hybrid/on-premises
workloads.

This research note is restricted to the personal use of hao.xiangshan@yottabyte.cn.
■ Cost management complexity: Estimating the actual costs associated with the
ongoing use of AWS APM and observability tools is difficult, particularly in
competitive analysis situations. Each service maintains its own pricing levers and
underlying cost elements, such as data transfer costs, that must also be accounted
for.
Broadcom
Broadcom is a Niche Player in this Magic Quadrant. Broadcom’s DX APM offering forms
part of its software portfolio, which includes mainframe, automation and security
products. Its DX APM offering is mainly focused on IT operations use cases in its installed
base. Its operations are geographically diversified, and its clients tend to be large-
enterprise organizations. Broadcom’s APM roadmap includes expanding the adoption of
self-service for APM, and increasing its capabilities for observability and analytics.
Strengths
■ Favorable pricing for Broadcom clients: Broadcom has many solutions in adjacent
areas, particularly in the domains of security, mainframe and automation.
Organizations with investments in Broadcom can leverage existing agreements to
include APM capacity, without a large increase in overall costs.
■ Integrated AIOps and automation: Broadcom’s DX APM and artificial intelligence for
IT operations (AIOps) solution offers functionality across user experience,
applications, infrastructure, network and mainframe monitoring. This includes the
ability to learn from historical code and configuration changes, and to estimate the
impact on application performance.
■ Strong global presence: Broadcom operates directly and through partners in multiple
geographies. DX APM software is localized into multiple languages other than
English, including Japanese, Spanish and French.
Cautions
■ Pricing complexity for new customers: Broadcom offers Portfolio License
Agreements (PLAs), which are large enterprise contracts for its full suite of AIOps
solutions, as well as stand-alone pricing for its APM solution. Although PLAs can
simplify pricing for existing clients, some potential new clients have expressed
frustration with these agreements, and they have difficulty making comparisons with
other vendors.
Gartner, Inc. | G00750730 Page 6 of 37
This research note is restricted to the personal use of hao.xiangshan@yottabyte.cn.
■ Focus on existing clients: Broadcom Software’s strategic direct sales focus is
primarily on large, existing customers. Broadcom has a focused regional partner
strategy with channel resellers and managed service providers (MSPs), and consults
with partners being nurtured based on geography, technical expertise and historic
service delivery performance. Broadcom solutions rarely make the shortlist for APM
solutions when the client is not an existing Broadcom customer.
■ No FedRAMP certification: Broadcom’s SaaS APM offering is not Federal Risk and
Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP)-compliant at the time of this
publication.
Cisco (AppDynamics)
Cisco (AppDynamics) is a Challenger in this Magic Quadrant. Its APM and observability
offering is mainly focused on enterprise organizations monitoring large, distributed, and
complex application and infrastructure environments; the end-user experience; and
business context. The solution can be hosted on-premises or as SaaS. Its operations are
mostly focused in the Americas, EMEA and APAC, and its clients tend to be midsize-to-
large enterprises in a wide range of vertical industries. Cisco (AppDynamics) APM and
observability roadmap is focused on simplifying cloud-native security by expanding
support for vulnerability and policy management, and enhancing its ability to monitor
public, cloud-based workloads.
Strengths
■ Broad monitoring portfolio: Cisco (AppDynamics) offers customers a broad
portfolio of infrastructure software products, including network, infrastructure and
workload monitoring, as well as monitoring for mainframe and SAP applications.
■ Security product: Cisco (AppDynamics) recently introduced Cisco Secure
Application, which integrates with AppDynamics agent data to support rapid
identification and protection of vulnerabilities/threats in monitored applications.
■ Global presence: Cisco (AppDynamics) has a strong global presence. The platform
is available for customers to self-host, and its SaaS data centers are widely
distributed in North America, EMEA, India and Brazil. It continues to expand into
EMEA.
Cautions
Gartner, Inc. | G00750730 Page 7 of 37
This research note is restricted to the personal use of hao.xiangshan@yottabyte.cn.
■ Current limited integration: Cisco’s “Full Stack Observability” vision promises a
unified experience for monitoring across AppDynamics, ThousandEyes and
Intersight. However, the products currently remain only loosely integrated, lacking a
common installation, user experience or data platform.
■ Lag in modern architecture support: During the past year, some clients have
increasingly mentioned to Gartner that they do not find that Cisco (AppDynamics)
fits well with their observability needs for modern applications and cloud-hosted
workloads. Cisco (AppDynamics) plans to launch a new cloud-native observability
tool later in 2022.
■ CPU core-based pricing: Cisco (AppDynamics) has shifted away from its traditional,
agent-based pricing model toward a metric that is based on the number of CPU
cores under management. The rollout of this pricing has been uneven, and affected
clients have expressed frustration related to their understanding of how existing
contracts will be updated with the new pricing and uncertainty about pricing
container environments.
Datadog
Datadog is a Leader in this Magic Quadrant. Its SaaS platform offers observability and
security solutions. Its operations are mainly focused in the U.S. and EMEA, with an
expanding presence in APAC and Latin America. Its clients range from startups to large
enterprises. In recent years, it has significantly expanded its portfolio of solutions beyond
infrastructure, log management and APM to include network monitoring, incident
management, DEM, database monitoring and security. Datadog has made a number of
acquisitions since the last Magic Quadrant, including tools such as Ozcode and CoScreen,
which are targeted toward developers. Future areas of investment include enhancements
to end-to-end visibility, improving the developer experience, telemetry governance, and
DevSecOps and cloud security.
Strengths
■ Strong platform portfolio: Datadog continues to expand its offerings for IT
operations, security and developers, while offering a unified platform and experience.
Datadog’s drawdown contracts enable clients to implement from across the portfolio
without needing a new contract.
■ Analytics usability: Watchdog, Datadog’s AI engine uses in-built machine learning
(ML) to simplify the complexity of monitoring cloud-native architectures. Watchdog
provides proactive alerts, augmented troubleshooting and automated root cause
analysis (RCA).
Gartner, Inc. | G00750730 Page 8 of 37
This research note is restricted to the personal use of hao.xiangshan@yottabyte.cn.
■ Funnel analysis: Datadog’s funnel analysis in real user monitoring (RUM) can
understand complex user behavior across user journeys, and identify the churn and
drop-off rates. This enables users from outside traditional infrastructure and
operations (I&O) to better understand end-customer behavior.
Cautions
■ Enterprise pricing flexibility: Some Gartner clients in procurement, particularly those
negotiating large-enterprise deals with Datadog, have expressed frustration when
dealing with Datadog account teams. These challenges include being offered list
pricing, inflexibility around discounting and limited incentives for deals longer than a
year.
■ Limited points of presence: Datadog’s SaaS offerings are available in the U.S. and
Europe (Germany). Some clients outside these regions (in particular, APAC and Latin
America) have concerns regarding data regulation and latency.
■ SaaS-only deployment: Datadog offers only a SaaS product, and has no on-
premises deployment options. This means it may not be suitable for clients with
regulations around data sovereignty, particularly without further geographic
expansion.
Dynatrace
Dynatrace is a Leader in this Magic Quadrant. Its comprehensive platform provides
observability with modularized capabilities for APM, IT infrastructure monitoring (ITIM),
DEM, business analytics, AIOps, cloud automation and application security. Its operations
are geographically diversified, with particular focus on EMEA, North America and the
mature APAC region. Its clients tend to be enterprise organizations. Dynatrace’s roadmap
includes extending the analytics capabilities of its Davis AI engine to new data sources,
including expanded OpenTelemetry analytics, and further expanding its presence in cloud
provider marketplaces, such as AWS, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
Strengths
■ Strong code-level analytics and AI capabilities: Distributed tracing and code-level
analytics with PurePath captures and analyzes transactions at every tier of the
application stack, including OpenTelemetry data, service mesh and serverless
computing services. This, along with Dynatrace’s Davis AI Engine, enables root cause
analysis of performance issues.
Gartner, Inc. | G00750730 Page 9 of 37
This research note is restricted to the personal use of hao.xiangshan@yottabyte.cn.
■ Convergence of APM and security: Dynatrace OneAgent and the AI capabilities of
Davis combine application and security context that determines whether a
vulnerability has public internet exposure and/or access to sensitive data. This also
identifies any other services or apps that are dependent or affected.
■ Ease of deployment: Dynatrace’s OneAgent architecture enables customers to
continuously discover and collect observability data in a fast and automated
fashion. Market feedback indicates that this leads to faster time to value.
Cautions
■ Memory-based pricing: Dynatrace’s host unit pricing is based on the host’s memory
size, so it varies according to the environment. This can make deal sizing complex
for larger environments, especially for highly containerized deployments.
■ Davis Data Units usage: Since last year, Dynatrace’s contracts include a separate
priced line item for its “Open Ingestion,” which it terms “Davis Data Units.” Unlike the
other components (usually Host Units and DEM units), procurement teams
frequently expressed questions as to the necessity of this component, as well as
concerns about their ability to project consumption over time.
■ Geographic presence: Dynatrace does not have a point of presence in the Middle
East, which limits options for clients in the region who have restrictions on data
sovereignty. Dynatrace recently opened its first office in the region in the United Arab
Emirates (UAE).
Elastic
Elastic is a Visionary in this Magic Quadrant. Its APM product is available as a SaaS
version (Elastic Observability) or a self-hosted version. The company is headquartered in
North America, and its customers come from a broad range of industries, but they tend to
be in the software and technology, financial services, public sector, and retail. The majority
