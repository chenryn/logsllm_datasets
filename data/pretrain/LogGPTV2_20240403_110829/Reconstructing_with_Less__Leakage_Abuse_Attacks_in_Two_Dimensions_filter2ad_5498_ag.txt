8 Conclusion and Future Work Directions
This paper presents practical reconstruction attacks from 2D range
queries on encrypted databases and furthers our understanding of
the intrinsic limitations of such attacks. A first future direction is
improving the performance of OR and ADR with advanced data
structures and specialized nonlinear solvers. Another direction is
exploring partial OR from a subset of the access pattern leakage.
All symmetries in two-dimensions occur also in higher dimensions
since we can project the points onto a 2D plane. Many of our
techniques extend naturally to higher dimensions, including the
notion of chains/antichains. It is an open problem whether new
symmetries arise in dimensions greater than two.

Figure 9: Accuracy (measured with the metrics defined in Section 7.3) and computational resource usage (CPU time and maxi-
mum memory required) of our reconstructions of the California, Spitz and NIS 2008 datasets (see Section 7.2) as a function of
the query ratio (number of queries observed by the adversary over the total number of possible queries), under the Uniform
(blue circle •), Beta (green star ★), and Gaussian (orange ♦) query distributions. In Section 7.2, we describe each database and
its characteristics, including the domain size and the total number of possible range queries.
