### Book Review: *A Tale of Two Sciences: Memoirs of a Dissident Scientist* by Peter A. Sturrock

**Reviewed by Richard Thieme**

In *A Tale of Two Sciences: Memoirs of a Dissident Scientist*, Dr. Peter A. Sturrock, a renowned Stanford physicist and astrophysicist, reflects on the dual threads of his professional life: one as a conventional scientist with a distinguished publication record, and another as an unconventional researcher exploring anomalous phenomena, particularly UFOs.

For those familiar with Sturrock only through his work in UFO studies, his extensive and respected career in mainstream science may come as a surprise. He recounts this part of his life in clear, accessible terms, demonstrating a deep understanding of complex topics such as plasma physics and pulsars. For readers seeking a deeper dive, the book includes helpful mathematical appendices.

Conversely, his foray into unconventional research has elicited a range of responses, from embarrassed smiles to outright ridicule. This spectrum of reactions is all too familiar to researchers in anomalous fields, who often find themselves tolerated at best and dismissed as eccentrics or worse at worst.

Sturrock's memoir weaves together the evidence he has accumulated, the content of his explorations, and his personal reflections on the reactions to his work. It is a well-crafted, carefully written, and eminently sane account that occasionally challenges the reader's preconceptions, especially for those who have uncritically accepted the dismissal of anomalies like UFOs and ESP.

This memoir is not a scientific treatise but rather a narrative that offers insight into the man and his internal journey. It also provides a significant contribution to the psychology of science and scientists. Sturrock serves as a wise mentor for younger scientists, cautioning them about the long-term commitment and resilience required to pursue unorthodox research. The path is arduous, marked by decades of dismissals from colleagues who, at their worst, are unscientific in their approach.

Sturrock's career has been characterized by cognitive dissonance, driven by a deeply scientific curiosity about the ineluctably real. His commitment to rigorous and unbiased scientific inquiry is evident throughout the book. As Francis Bacon once said, "Whatever deserves to exist deserves to be known." This sentiment encapsulates Sturrock's approach, whether in conventional or unconventional science.

Sturrock is well-known in UFO circles for organizing the Pocantico Conference in September 1997, which brought together a diverse group of scientists to discuss UFO phenomena. Financed by Laurence Rockefeller, the conference aimed to lend credibility to UFO research. The proceedings, detailed in Sturrock's earlier work, *The UFO Enigma: a New Review of the Physical Evidence* (1999), are revisited in this memoir. The book's preface begins with the poignant admission, "It is not easy to have a split personality," highlighting Sturrock's quest to integrate his two scientific personas.

The memoir delves into the "strangeness" of some UFO reports, aspects that might seem like science fiction to the uninitiated. Sturrock proposes an alternative view of physics that could account for these anomalies, suggesting that current models of reality may be insufficient. He argues that oblique trajectories must be explored to account for these observations, potentially leading to practical advancements in spacetime travel, energy consumption, and medicine.

To justify his unorthodox pursuits, Sturrock draws on historical examples of theories initially rejected but later vindicated, such as meteorites, battered child syndrome, and plate tectonics. These stories remind both scientists and the public that good science should consider anomalies worthy of investigation. Sturrock emphasizes his careful, rigorous approach to research, listening and observing before formulating hypotheses.

The first part of the memoir reviews Sturrock's educational and vocational history, linked by memories of influential teachers, mentors, and colleagues. This structure, typical of memoirs, underscores the importance of personal relationships in shaping his scientific journey.

In conclusion, *A Tale of Two Sciences* is a compelling and thought-provoking read that challenges the boundaries of conventional science and encourages a more open-minded approach to anomalous phenomena.
