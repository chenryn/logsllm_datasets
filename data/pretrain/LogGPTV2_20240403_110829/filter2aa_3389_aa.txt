“A Tale of Two Sciences:  Memoirs of a Dissident Scientist,” by Dr. Peter A. Sturrock, is
a personal work by the well-known Stanford physicist and astrophysicist, reflecting on
the sometimes complementary, sometimes discordant threads of his professional lives:
one as a conventional scientist, with a long list of respected publications, and one as an
unconventional scientist who explored anomalous phenomena, in particular UFO
phenomena. 
His conventional scientific career might be a surprise to those who know him only in
relationship to UFO studies; it is recounted here in terms that any educated layman can
understand – in fact, the simplicity and clarity of his explanations of, say, plasma physics
or pulsars, are a testimony to his deep knowledge – one can’t explain complex
phenomena so clearly otherwise. And for readers who want to go a little deeper, there is a
small bit of helpful math in appendices.
His unconventional career, on the other hand, has resulted in the full spectrum of
responses which unfortunately are familiar to all researchers in anomalies –embarrassed
smiles, curt dismissals, ridicule, the bemused shaking of a lot of heads – all of which tell
the researcher that he or she is at best tolerated as an eccentric and at worst dismissed as a
nut case.  
The two strands of his unconventional career consist of accumulated evidence, the
content of his explorations, food for further thought and research, and his personal
account of reactions to that work and in turn his reactions to those reactions over a
lifetime. 
This is a memoir, not a scientific treatise, so it must be evaluated for what it tells us about
the man and his internal journey as well as the rewards of a long career in orthodox
scientific research. It is well-written, careful in its pronouncements, understated,
eminently sane, and occasionally mind-boggling, especially for the uninitiated who
previously accepted the dismissal of anomalies like UFOs and ESP uncritically. The book
is a significant contribution to the psychology of science and scientists as well and can
serve as the wise words of a mentor for younger scientists tempted by the forbidden.
Sturrock warns those who would follow in his footsteps to count the cost. Enduring
decades of abrasive dismissals by scientists who at their personal worst are unscientific
makes this path a long-distance run, not a sprint, that requires stamina, grit, and
renewable commitment.
A lifetime of cognitive dissonance is one result of the subject matter Sturrock investigates
and frequent rejection of the pursuit itself, much less the fruits of that pursuit. At the core
his commitment is the essence of a properly scientific attitude, namely, curiosity,
curiosity about the ineluctably real that imprints itself indelibly on one’s consciousness.
Reading this narrative, one thinks of Francis Bacon’s response when criticized by the
Church for dissecting cadavers to learn about human anatomy because the Church was
afraid that his discoveries might contradict its teachings: “Whatever deserves to exist
deserves to be known.” 
So ultimately there has been for Peter Sturrock not two careers but one and one mode of
knowing and wanting to know, the scientific mode applied rigorously and without
prejudice. Conventional and unconventional science alike are the front and back of a
single discipline requiring that one attends to the data, formulate hypotheses, then test
and revise them, leaving the next generation with a slightly better understanding of what
seems to exists in a complex universe. 
Sturrock is well known in UFO circles as the organizer of the Pocantico Conference in
September 1997 which brought together an eclectic group of scientists at the Pocantico
Conference Center near Tarrytown, New York to hear presentations on selected cases and
some summaries of UFO effects by serious researchers. Financed by Laurence
Rockefeller, the conference straddled the forbidden and the familiar and included
researchers known to readers of this journal such as Jacques Vallee, Mark Rodigher, and
Richard Haines. The medium, a respectable scientific conference, was intended to be the
message as well, leading to greater credibility for research into UFO phenomena. The
conference concluded with carefully phrased, conservative, thoughtful suggestions that
challenged orthodox scientists by proposing additional topics and structures for research.
Sturrock wrote about the conference in detail in “The UFO Enigma: a New Review of the
Physical Evidence,” published in 1999 by Warner Books.  Much of that material is
reviewed in this memoir, but because this is a memoir, there is a critical difference: “It is
not easy to have a split personality,” Sturrock writes in the first sentence of the preface;
“this book is – in part – an attempt to remedy that situation.” That compelling drive to
clarify the data, integrate it into a unified framework, and articulate tentative but
provocative conclusions about what it tells us to explore next – this is a subtext of this
work. That drive, Sturrock makes clear, is motivated in part by the desire to alleviate the
cognitive dissonance of which I spoke; that internal conflict must be addressed by a
mature healthy ego, one’s life work must be justified and justifiable, to others as well as
oneself. That too is a subtext of this work. Sturrock the man as well as the wary scientist
shows up and makes his case. By establishing basic criteria – does it exist? therefore is it
deserving of being understood? – for work in all arenas, Sturrock challenges again and
again the irrational or non-rational rejection of the subject matter in itself by those who
claim the scientific method as their modus opperandi. He places the burden on scientists
who refuse even to look much less pay attention. And that challenge, I am afraid, will be
handled by most career scientists as they have handled both Sturrock and the subject
matter in the past, by not acknowledging that it exists.
Because Sturrock is willing in this personal account to reveal more of the feeling behind
his thinking, he is impelled to conclusions that have not been often articulated in the past.
UFO researchers since Hynek have noted the “strangeness” of some reports, aspects of
the experience that might sound like science fiction to those unfamiliar with the now-
voluminous body of research. At the end of the work, he advances an alternative view of
physics that might account for the “strangeness” of some UFO reports, that vehicles or
entities seem to be here yet not here at the same time, that observers walk around a
luminous object which disappears as if tucked into a nook of spacetime behind a hidden
curtain, that experiences of telepathic communication or transfer of knowledge have
taken place... and that the compelling testimony of people for sixty years (and likely
more) from all over the world, their experiences in agreement in many small details ...
this mass of experience and data should not be ignored.
His conclusions suggest in essence that current models of reality derived from physics do
not account for what has been observed; therefore oblique trajectories must be drawn and
followed to explore possibilities to begin to account for them – and perhaps reap practical
rewards for spacetime travel, energy consumption, and medicine.
And because the narrative is from one point of view an apologia, a justification of a
lifetime of unorthodox pursuits, and because sanity, like wisdom, is contextual, the author
marshals a sequence of historical antecedents of theories that were rejected out of hand
when first proposed but that turned out to be of merit. Consensus realities in the past led
to the same kind of ridicule and “debunking” that UFO researchers experience today;
heterodox ideas gained a foothold among mainstream scientists “one funeral at a time,”
as Max Planck described progress in science.  Sturrock refers to the famous instance of
meteorites which could not possibly exist because “rocks do not fall from the sky,” and
battered child syndrome, the details of which could not be heard when first presented to
doctors, and the theory of plate tectonics, and in his primary domain of expertise, theories
about neutrinos and pulsars.  One thinks too of Raymond Dart and his work on
Australopithecus, widely rejected for many years. 
Such stories are widely known, and some of the motive power for repeating them comes I
suspect from the need to establish a “tradition” of advances in science that occurred after
prophets who first articulated them had been scorned and dishonored.  So on one level,
the text reminds both scientists and laity that good science ought to consider anomalies
worthy of investigation, and on a personal or psychological level, the author must make
the case that in all of the work he has done, he listens carefully, observes scrupulously,
and rigorously investigates before formulating a hypothesis. 
Part of making his case is the entire first part of the memoir which reviews Sturrock’s
educational and vocational history, linked by memories of influential teachers, mentors,
and colleagues. That organizing principle is an attribute of memoirs too, the narrative
sequence determined by memories of people important to the author’s personal and
