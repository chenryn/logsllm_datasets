User: I noticed that using cat on a file works in ipython. It doesn't appear to be listed as a magic command... so I am confused how/why it works. What lets cat work in ipython interactive shell?
Assistant: cat is one of the pre-defined system command aliases. Type %alias to see the list of aliases in your current ipython session.
