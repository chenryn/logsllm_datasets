User: I am trying to retrieve internal attributes from openldap server. More specifically I need to retrieve entryUUID attribute of an object. In LDAP, objectGUID is being fetched from server but couldn't retrieve similar field from openldap.
SCOPE_SUBTREE is being used to retrieve attributes.
Anyone knows way out? Thanks in advance.
Assistant: It's an operational attribute, so you have to request it explicitly, or include "+" in the attributes to be returned.
However you should not be using this for your own purposes. It's none of your business. It can change across backup/restore, for example.
