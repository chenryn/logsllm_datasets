Identifying botnets helps categorize
queries with malicious intentions. The behaviors of botnet
hosts are usually bursty in time [30]. Their IP addresses are
widely distributed across a large number of networks. In
contrast, data center hosts are long-lived, well-maintained
machines for dedicated tasks. Their IP addresses usually
belong to a small number of administrative domains.
We explore both the temporal and spatial characteristics
of hosts to classify a cluster. The temporal behaviors de-
scribe the persistence of the automated search behaviors,
while the spatial behaviors describe the distribution of host
IP addresses across the Internet. To quantify the spatial be-
haviors of a cluster, we use the ratio of the number of unique
/24 preﬁxes over the number of unique IP addresses in a
cluster, deﬁned as r. Speciﬁcally, r = num of /24 pref ixes
.
num of IP s
We use the following two criteria in our classiﬁcation:
1. If the majority (90%) of hosts in a cluster are active
for only a short period (≤ 3 days) and the host IP ad-
dresses are widely distributed (r ≥ 0.7), we classify
this cluster as a likely botnet cluster.
2. If the majority (90%) of hosts in a cluster are long-
lasting (≥ 10 days) and the IP addresses are from a
small number of different networks (r ≤ 0.3), we clas-
sify the cluster as likely a data-center cluster.
This step cannot classify all host clusters, but it does
identify groups with well-known, distinguishing behavior
patterns. Only a small percentage of clusters (around 4%)
cannot be classiﬁed using our approach.
4 Measurement Results
We apply SBotScope to the two datasets described in Ta-
ble 2 (see Section 3). We present our experiment results in
this section.

The Pattern Generation process is our technical basis for
deriving query intentions. Table 5 shows that this step re-
duces the data from over 3 × 109 raw queries to fewer than
106 query patterns. These patterns can be further aggre-
gated into 1,823 and 3,499 pattern trees for dataset D1 and
D2, respectively.
After further grouping pattern trees into semantically
correlated topics, we examine the compositions of query
intentions in detail. Table 6 presents the top 6 most pop-
ular topics as well as the top 5 query patterns that match the

most number of queries under each topic. Previous work
has suggested the use of bot queries for searching for vul-
nerabilities. Indeed, we ﬁnd vulnerability-searching queries
are the dominant category, corresponding to almost 1/3 of
all bot queries. The second most popular topic (around 11%
of bot queries) is about searching for email addresses or user
accounts, which include critical information for attackers to
perform spamming or account hijacking attacks more effec-
tively. The next four popular categories are used for con-
tent downloads, fashion items (e.g., handbags, cloths, and
watches), car sales, and news.
Investigating further into the vulnerability searching
queries, we ﬁnd that this topic includes 170 pattern trees and
7,295 query patterns. Figure 5 shows three example pattern
trees under this topic. A majority of query patterns in this
category contain keywords that are known to be related to
vulnerabilities such as “php”, “yabb”, “powered”, “topic”,
“forum”, “thread”, “board”, and “vbulletin” [20]. In partic-
ular, both “powered” and “php” are popular words with a
large number of subtrees under each of them. These exam-
ples demonstrate the effectiveness of SBotScope in identi-
fying semantically correlated patterns even when they are
not strongly connected syntactically (i.e., they do not share
common words). These vulnerability-searching queries
provide information to prevent future attacks. For exam-
ple, Table 7 shows three known vulnerabilities [2] that one
can derive from our query patterns, and we leave it as future
work to further explore this direction.
4.2 Query Origin Analysis
We now examine the query origin distributions and clas-
siﬁcation. After performing the host clustering analysis de-
scribed in Section 3.5, we obtain in total 39,037 and 47,217
clusters for dataset D1 and D2, respectively. As indicated
in Table 8, these clusters contain 90% and 82% of all bot
queries, suggesting that a vast majority of bot queries are
generated from coordinated hosts.

Table 6. Top six popular topics and their top ﬁve patterns
We further classify the group temporal and spatial be-
haviors to separate botnet clusters and data center clusters.
We combine all the clusters from dataset D1 and D2, and
plot each cluster as a point in a two-dimensional space in
Figure 6.
The X-axis represents the ratio of the number of /24 net-
work preﬁxes over the number of unique IP addresses in
a cluster, i.e., r in Section 3.5.4. A small ratio means the
majority of hosts in a cluster come from a small number
of network ranges, so the cluster is more likely to consist
of hosts from common administrations. In contrast, a large
ratio in the X-axis suggests that the cluster is more widely
dispersed in the Internet, with each network range having
only a few hosts.
The Y-axis represents the average active periods of a host
(in terms of days) in a cluster. Long-lived clusters are more
likely data center hosts, while transient clusters are more
likely associated with botnet activities.
From the ﬁgure, we observe that the majority of the clus-
ters are transient and have widely distributed IP addresses,
indicating the existence of a large number of botnets. The
density of the points in the ﬁgure drops signiﬁcantly as the
ratio r decreases and the average number of active days in-
creases. We ﬁnd that the number of data center clusters is
relatively small. Applying the heuristics in Section 3.5.4,
we identify in total 37,268 and 44,252 botnet clusters, and
137 and 150 data center clusters from D1 and D2, respec-
tively. Accordingly, we obtain 8,154,180 and 7,278,295 IPs
in botnet clusters, and 13,364 and 19,559 IPs in data center

clusters from D1 and D2. Only a small percentage of clus-
ters, 4.2% in D1 and 6% in D2, remain unclassiﬁed, and we
leave them for future studies.
The existence of botnet activities is perhaps not sur-
prising [13], but the prevalence and scale of using botnets
for submitting bot queries are more than we had expected.
These query-submitting botnets represent an important cat-
egory of botnets that are not well studied yet. Their query
contents and behavior patterns will be valuable to analyze
the trends and scales of malicious activities.

The number of data center clusters is also non-trivial.
Apart from legitimate activities from data centers, the ex-
istence of malicious activities from data centers may indi-
cate a new trend, where attackers have started exploiting
cloud-computing or other well-maintained infrastructures
for launching attacks.
4.3 Cluster Validation
The quality of the identiﬁed clusters and their classiﬁ-
cation could be a concern due to the unsupervised nature
of our clustering process. Ideally, we would like to obtain
the ground-truth information regarding botnet memberships
and data center usages. Nevertheless, it is extremely hard,
if not impossible, to build such ground-truth in practice.
In the lack of ground-truth, we adopt the following three
methods to sanity check our results. First, we evaluate the
quality of clustering using the extra ﬁelds presented in Ta-
ble 1. Intuitively, if a host group was correctly identiﬁed,
they may exhibit similar behaviors in choosing ﬁelds such
as U A, F orm, Ref errer, as they all use the same script.
Second, we perform Whois [5] lookups to examine the
names and the types of the ASes that correspond to different
types of clusters. The purpose is to validate whether botnet
hosts indeed mostly correspond to consumer networks, and
whether data center hosts indeed belong to well known data
center networks or hosting services. Third, we compare our
botnet host lists with those derived from the Conﬁcker IP
address lists in [28] by their courtesy.
4.3.1 Cluster Behavior Similarity Analysis
For each cluster, we examine whether the majority of its
“hosts” have identical ﬁeld values. For each host H, we ﬁrst
pick its dominant values for U A, F orm, and Ref errer.
We then consider these metrics for both the queries match-
ing patterns as well as the queries not matching any patterns.

Figure 7. Percentage of clusters sharing iden-
tical metrics.
In total, we have six metrics. We then compute the percent-
age of a cluster sharing identical values for these metrics.
For each metric, we also consider the case where each host
randomly chooses a different ﬁeld value (e.g., by adopting
randomization strategies to evade detection). In this case,
we set the value of the corresponding ﬁeld to “random” if
its values exhibit complete randomness.
Figure 7 shows the distribution in terms of the number
of metrics on which a cluster shows strong consistency (i.e.,
90% of hosts in this cluster share an identical value). Over-
all, 82.96% clusters from D1 and 85.89% clusters from D2
share at least one identical metric. A large percentage of
clusters have all six values identical across hosts. These are
strong indications of coordinated behaviors.
4.3.2 Host Network Type Analysis
As botnet and data center clusters usually come from dif-
ferent network regions, we reverse lookup the autonomous
system number (i.e., AS number) for each IP address. In ad-
dition, we perform Whois [5] lookups on the AS numbers,
and examine the names and the types of networks.
Table 9 lists the top ﬁve most popular AS names for both
types of clusters. We observe that botnet clusters include
mainly hosts from residential broadband ISPs and consumer
