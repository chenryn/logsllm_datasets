### Identifying Botnets and Data Center Hosts

Identifying botnets is crucial for categorizing queries with malicious intentions. Botnet hosts typically exhibit bursty behavior over time [30] and their IP addresses are widely distributed across a large number of networks. In contrast, data center hosts are long-lived, well-maintained machines dedicated to specific tasks, and their IP addresses usually belong to a small number of administrative domains.

#### Temporal and Spatial Characteristics

To classify host clusters, we analyze both temporal and spatial characteristics:

- **Temporal Behaviors:** These describe the persistence of automated search behaviors.
- **Spatial Behaviors:** These describe the distribution of host IP addresses across the Internet.

We quantify the spatial behaviors of a cluster using the ratio \( r \) of the number of unique /24 prefixes to the number of unique IP addresses in the cluster:
\[ r = \frac{\text{number of unique /24 prefixes}}{\text{number of unique IP addresses}} \]

#### Classification Criteria

1. **Likely Botnet Cluster:**
   - If 90% of hosts in a cluster are active for only a short period (≤ 3 days) and the host IP addresses are widely distributed (\( r \geq 0.7 \)), the cluster is classified as a likely botnet cluster.

2. **Likely Data Center Cluster:**
   - If 90% of hosts in a cluster are long-lasting (≥ 10 days) and the IP addresses are from a small number of different networks (\( r \leq 0.3 \)), the cluster is classified as a likely data center cluster.

This method effectively identifies clusters with well-known, distinguishing behavior patterns, though around 4% of clusters remain unclassified.

### Measurement Results

We applied SBotScope to the datasets described in Table 2 (see Section 3). The following sections present our experiment results.

#### Query Intention Analysis

**Query Patterns:**

| Datasets | Word-Combinations | Exact Queries |
|----------|-------------------|---------------|
| D1       | 361,568           | 364,405       |
| D2       | 370,338           | 593,349       |

The Pattern Generation process reduces the data from over \( 3 \times 10^9 \) raw queries to fewer than \( 10^6 \) query patterns. These patterns can be further aggregated into 1,823 and 3,499 pattern trees for datasets D1 and D2, respectively.

After grouping pattern trees into semantically correlated topics, we examined the compositions of query intentions. Table 6 presents the top 6 most popular topics and the top 5 query patterns under each topic.

**Top 6 Popular Topics:**

| Topic                   | % of Queries | Top 5 Patterns                                                                                          |

**Example Vulnerabilities:**

| Data    | # of Clusters | % of Queries | % of Clusters Validated |
|---------|---------------|--------------|-------------------------|
| D1      | 39,037        | 90.30%       | 82.96%                  |
| D2      | 47,217        | 82.18%       | 85.89%                  |

**Vulnerability-Searching Queries:**

- **Pattern Trees:** 170
- **Query Patterns:** 7,295
- **Keywords:** "php", "yabb", "powered", "topic", "forum", "thread", "board", "vbulletin" [20]

These queries provide valuable information for preventing future attacks. For example, Table 7 shows three known vulnerabilities derived from our query patterns.

#### Query Origin Analysis

We analyzed the query origin distributions and classification. After performing the host clustering analysis, we obtained 39,037 and 47,217 clusters for datasets D1 and D2, respectively. These clusters contain 90% and 82% of all bot queries, indicating that a vast majority of bot queries are generated from coordinated hosts.

**Cluster Classification:**

- **Botnet Clusters:**
  - D1: 37,268
  - D2: 44,252

- **Data Center Clusters:**
  - D1: 137
  - D2: 150

- **IPs in Botnet Clusters:**
  - D1: 8,154,180
  - D2: 7,278,295

- **IPs in Data Center Clusters:**
  - D1: 13,364
  - D2: 19,559

Only a small percentage of clusters (4.2% in D1 and 6% in D2) remain unclassified.

#### Cluster Validation

To ensure the quality of the identified clusters and their classification, we adopted the following methods:

1. **Behavior Similarity Analysis:**
   - We evaluated the quality of clustering using extra fields such as User-Agent (UA), Form, and Referrer. Figure 7 shows the distribution of clusters sharing identical metrics.

2. **Host Network Type Analysis:**
   - We performed reverse lookups on the autonomous system numbers (AS numbers) and examined the names and types of networks. Table 9 lists the top five most popular AS names for both types of clusters.

**Top 5 AS Names:**

| ASN  | Country | Type            | ASN  | Country | Type            |
|------|---------|-----------------|------|---------|-----------------|
| 4134 | CN      | Residential ISP | 15003| US      | Data Center     |
| 8151 | MX      | Residential ISP | 36351| US      | Data Center     |
| 3269 | IT      | Residential ISP | 25973| US      | Data Center     |
| 27699| BR      | Residential ISP | 21788| US      | Data Center     |
| 4837 | CN      | Residential ISP | 13647| US      | Data Center     |

These results indicate that botnet hosts mainly come from residential broadband ISPs, while data center hosts belong to well-known data center networks or hosting services.

### Conclusion

The prevalence and scale of botnet activities for submitting queries are significant. Analyzing these query contents and behavior patterns will be valuable for understanding the trends and scales of malicious activities. Additionally, the existence of malicious activities from data centers may indicate a new trend where attackers exploit cloud-computing or other well-maintained infrastructures for launching attacks.
