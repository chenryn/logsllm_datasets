C. Longitudinal Analysis
Collecting data for nearly two years gives us the ability
to observe changes in censorship over time. Figure 7 shows
censorship trends for the six countries ICLab can monitor
that block the most URLs from the global test lists (ATL and
CLBL-G), plus a global trend line computed from aggregate
measurements from all the other monitored countries. We do
not have complete coverage for Iran and Saudi Arabia, due to
the outages mentioned in §III-D. The large dip in several of
the trend lines in February 2017 is an artifact due to month-

has attempted to suppress both internal political opposition
and news published from other countries. International news
organizations took notice of the increased level of Turkish
online censorship in May of 2017 [40], [74], while ICLab
detected it around the end of April.
D. Heuristic False Positives
We manually reviewed the results of all of our heuristic
detectors for errors. Manual review cannot detect false negatives,
because we have no way of knowing that we should have
detected a site as censored, but false positives are usually
obvious. Here we discuss the most significant cases we found,
and how we adjusted the heuristics to compensate.
DNS Manipulation. We manually verified the detection results
identified by each heuristic. The only heuristic producing false
positives was the rule for when a vantage point and control
nodes receive addresses in different ASes. As we mentioned
in Section IV-A, this heuristic gives a false positive rate on
the order of 10−4 with the value of θ we selected.
Packet injection. As with DNS manipulation, we manually
reviewed the results of each heuristic for false positives. We
found many false positives for RST or ICMP unreachable
instead of SYN-ACK, leading us to reclassify these as only
“probable” censorship and not include them in the synthetic
analysis above. We also found cases in all of the categories
where a packet anomaly was only observed once, for a
URL that seemed unlikely to be censored from that vantage
(e.g., connection disrupted to an airline website from a VPN
vantage in the USA). We therefore discount all cases where a
packet anomaly has only been observed once for that URL in
that country.
Block pages. Our set of regular expressions did initially
produce some false positives, for instance on news reportage
of censorship, quoting the text of a block page. We manually
reviewed all of the matches and adjusted the regular expressions
until no false positives remained. It was always possible to do
this without losing any true positives.
VI. Other Cases of Network Interference
In this section, we describe three cases of network inter-
ference discovered with ICLab, that are different from the
form of censorship we set out to detect: Geoblocking by
content providers (§VI-A), injection of a script to fingerprint
clients (§VI-B), and injected malware (§VI-C).
A. Geoblocking and HTTP 451
HTTP status code 451, “Unavailable for Legal Reasons,”
was defined in 2016 for web servers to use when they cannot
provide content due to a legal obstacle (e.g., the Google restricts
access to clients from Iran to enforce US sanctions [57]) or
requests from foreign governments [14].
We observe 23 unique websites that return status 451, from
vantages in 21 countries. Six of these cases appear to be
wordpress.com complying with requests from Turkey and Russia
(for blogs related to political and religious advocacy). Along

the level of censorship, within the six countries where we observe the most
censorship of URLs from ATL and CLBL-G, plus the aggregate of all other
monitored countries.
to-month churn within the Alexa rankings (see Scheitle et al.
[71]).
The global trend line shows a steady decreasing trend, which
we attribute to the rising use of secure channel protocols
(e.g., TLS) and circumvention tools. This trend is also visible
for South Korea but not for the other top five countries.
Iran blocks 20–30% of the URLs from ATL, more than any
other country. This is due to extensive blocking of URLs in
the NEWS and BLOG categories. Saudi Arabia consistently
blocks roughly 10% of ATL and CLBL-G URLs, mostly
from the PORN and GAMB categories with some NEWS
as well. South Korea applies a similar level of blocking for the
PORN and GAMB categories; it is a much more democratic
nation than Saudia Arabia, but it nonetheless has applied
draconian restrictions to “indecent Internet sites” (including
both pornography and gambling sites) since before 2008 [63].
Censorship in Kenya is stable at a rate of roughly 0.4%
except for March 2017, where the rate spikes to 10%. This
is an artifact; for that one month, our VOD in Kenya was
connected to a network that applied much more aggressive
“filtering” to porn, gambling, and proxy sites than is typical for
Kenya, using a commercial product.
At the beginning of 2018, we observe a drop in the level of
filtering in India, from 2% to 0.8%, followed by a slow rise
back to about 1.5% after about four months. This coincides
with political events: India’s telecommunications regulator
announced support for “net neutrality” at the end of 2017 [70],
[89], and most ISPs suspended their filtering in response.
However, when a detailed regulation on net neutrality was
published in mid-2018 [75], it became clear that the government
had not intended to relax its policy regarding content deemed
to be illegal, and the filtering was partially reinstated.
Similarly, we see a rise in the level of filtering in Turkey in
June 2017, from an earlier level of 3% to 5%. Although it is
not visible on this chart, the topics censored also change at
this time. Prior to the rise, most of the blocked sites in Turkey
carried pornography and other sexual content; after the rise,
many more news sites were blocked. This, too, coincides with
political events. Following a controversial referendum which

explaining that wordpress.com is complying with local laws
and court orders. Two more websites (both pornographic) were
observed to return status 451 from Russia, with HTTP server
headers indicating the error originates from the Cloudflare
CDN, but without any explanation. Since the adoption of the
GDPR [41] we have observed a few sites returning status 451
when visited from European countries.
Since status 451 is relatively new, the older, more generic
status 403 (“Forbidden”) is also used to indicate geoblocking for
legal reasons. Applying the tag frequency clustering technique
described in Section IV-C to the accompanying HTML, we
were able to discover six more URLs, in four countries, where
status 403 is used with a block page stating that access is
prohibited from the client’s location. Three of these were
gambling sites, with the text of the block page stating that
the sites are complying with local regulations.
We also observe a related phenomenon at the DNS level.
From a single VPN server located in the USA, we ob-
served netflix.com resolving to an IANA-reserved IP address,
198.18.0.3. This could be Netflix refusing to provide their
service to users behind a VPN.
