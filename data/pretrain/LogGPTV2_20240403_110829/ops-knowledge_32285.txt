Question: "Why is it incorrect to state that a server can safely set cookies with domain attributes matching any top-level domain (TLD), such as '.com' or '.edu'?"
 "A": "Cookies with domain attributes matching a TLD are too specific and limit the browser's ability to manage sessions effectively."
 "B": "Setting a cookie with a TLD domain allows the cookie to be sent to all websites sharing the same TLD, which is a security risk."
 "C": "Browsers do not recognize TLDs in domain attributes and will, therefore, ignore such cookies by default."
 "D": "Using TLDs as domain attributes in cookies increases the risk of DNS hijacking and is considered a bad practice."
Answer: B
