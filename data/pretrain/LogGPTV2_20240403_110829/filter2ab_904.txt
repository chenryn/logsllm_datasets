### Title: Exploiting Windows Hello for Business at Black Hat EU 2019

**Abstract:**

In Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016, Microsoft introduced Windows Hello for Business (WHfB), a feature designed to enable password-less authentication in Active Directory-based environments. The goal of WHfB is to reduce the risk of password theft by leveraging well-known industry standards such as Kerberos PKINIT, JWT, WS-Trust, and FIDO2, along with advanced cryptographic mechanisms like TPM key attestation and token binding.

Despite its potential, WHfB is overly complex, lacks adequate management tools, and has insufficient documentation, making it a black box for most administrators, security auditors, and penetration testers. This lack of transparency and manageability introduces significant challenges in securing and auditing environments that use or are affected by WHfB.

**Key Findings:**

During our analysis of the current WHfB implementation, we identified several new attack vectors that can lead to privilege escalation and persistence. Our most significant discovery is a new type of persistent Active Directory backdoor. To our knowledge, this backdoor is not detected by existing security solutions and audit procedures, and it can affect even organizations that do not actively use WHfB.

Additionally, we found that following Microsoft's mitigation guide for a previously known vulnerability not only fails to protect against the new threats but may also introduce additional security issues into the system. These vulnerabilities can be exploited to impersonate Active Directory users without requiring any special permissions.

**Presentation Overview:**

In this talk, we will present our findings and demonstrate a new toolset designed to:

1. **Scan Corporate Environments:** Identify and assess the vulnerabilities associated with WHfB.
2. **Resolve Issues:** Provide actionable steps to mitigate the discovered vulnerabilities.
3. **Enhance Visibility:** Offer detailed insights into the usage and configuration of WHfB in Active Directory environments.

By providing these tools and insights, we aim to help organizations better understand and secure their WHfB implementations, ensuring a more robust and resilient security posture.

**Conclusion:**

The complexity and lack of transparency in WHfB present significant security risks. Our research and tools aim to bridge this gap, offering practical solutions to detect, mitigate, and manage these vulnerabilities, thereby enhancing the overall security of Active Directory environments.
