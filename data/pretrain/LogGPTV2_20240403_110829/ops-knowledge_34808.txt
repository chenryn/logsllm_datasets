User: I have a script that I am running at /var/scripts/SomeAppName/source/importer/processor.py
That script triggers an error that has a line that says:
File "build/bdist.linux-i686/egg/something/cms/browser.py", line 43, in GetBrowser 
The problem I'm running into is that I'm unable to locate build/bdist.linux-i686/egg/something/cms/browser.py but I can locate /var/scripts/AnotherApp/appcommon/cms/browser.py and /var/scripts/AnotherApp/build/lib/appcommon/cms/browser.py 
I have modieified both of those files to remove the part that is throwing the error but am still getting the same error as if the file hasn't been modified at all.
I'm guessing the problem is that I'm not modifying the correct file or I need to compile the script some how but I'm just not able to find out where/how to do this.
I have tried restarting apache but with no luck.
Any help or guidance as to where I should be looking or if I need to run some sort of command to re-compile to browser.py file would be appreciated.
Assistant: Closing the loop: bdist in the path is a sign that the package was installed with setup.py install and is running from the standard Python system path, not from wherever you have it checked out.
Easy fix is to setup.py install it again.
Harder fix is to uninstall it and fiddle with Apache's working directory, but that's not quite my area.  :)
