at the single antenna at rx1, tx3 is still going to use interference
nulling. This constraint requires tx3 to satisfy only one additional
equation, Eq. 2a. To eliminate interference at the 2-antenna receiver
rx2, tx3 is however going to use interference alignment. This con-
straint requires satisfying only one additional equation, as opposed
to the two equations required for nulling at the two antennas at
rx2. Speciﬁcally, tx3 can align its signal at rx2 with the interfer-
ence that rx2 already sees from the ﬁrst transmitter, tx1, as shown
in the bottom graph (below rx2) in Fig. 3. Then, rx2 only sees two
signals, the symbol q transmitted by tx2 and the combined inter-
ference from tx1 and tx3, because the two signals from tx1 and
tx3 are now aligned and look like coming from a single interferer.
Speciﬁcally, the two equations received by rx2 are:
y2 = h12p + (h22 + αh32)q + (α′h42 + β′h52 + γ′h62)r
y3 = h13p + (h23 + αh33)q + (α′h43 + β′h53 + γ′h63)r,
(3a)
(3b)
and hence aligning the interference from tx1 and tx3 requires tx3
to satisfy the following equation:
(α′h42+β′h52+γ′h62)
h12
=
(α′h43+β′h53+γ′h63)
h13
=L,
(4)
where L is any constant. If tx3 chooses the parameters α′, β′, and
γ′ to satisfy Eq. 4, Eqs. 3a and 3b can be rewritten as:
y2 = h12(p + Lr) + (h22 + αh32)q
y3 = h13(p + Lr) + (h23 + αh33)q.
The receiver, rx2, now has two independent equations in two un-
knowns, (p + Lr) and q, and hence can decode its desired symbol
q. (Note that rx2 cannot decode p and r separately but this is ﬁne
because it does not want these symbols.)
Thus, in total, tx3 has to satisfy two equations to ensure that
it does not interfere with the ongoing transmissions: the nulling
equation (Eq. 2a) at rx1 and the alignment equation (Eq. 4) at rx2.
Then, tx3 can use the third degree of freedom to transmit to its own
receiver.
We can continue adding additional transmitter-receiver pairs as
long as they have additional antennas. By nulling at the ﬁrst re-
ceiver and aligning at all the remaining receivers, each additional
transmitter can transmit to its own receiver while ensuring no inter-
ference to ongoing transmissions.
Generalizing to Different Numbers of Antennas at the Trans-
mitter and Receiver: Finally, n+ generalizes to scenarios where
a transmitter and its receivers have different numbers of antennas.
Consider, for example, the scenario in Fig. 4 where a 2-antenna ac-
cess point, AP1, has a single-antenna client, c1, and a 3-antenna
AP, AP2, has two 2-antenna clients, c2 and c3. Say that the single-
antenna client is transmitting to its AP. In today’s networks, this
will prevent any other node from transmitting concurrently. How-
ever, with n+, the 3-antenna AP can transmit concurrently two
packets, one to each of its clients, i.e., p2 to client c2 and p3 to
client c3 as shown in Fig. 4.
So how does the 3-antenna AP transmit these concurrent packets
while protecting the ongoing reception at the 2-antenna AP? To
protect the ongoing reception, the 3-antenna AP must ensure that
both of its transmitted packets (p2 and p3) are received at the 2-
antenna AP along a direction orthogonal to the signal of interest to
that AP, i.e., the signal from c1 (called p1 in Fig. 4). This allows
the 2-antenna AP to continue to receive its client’s signal without
interference, as shown in the bottom graphs (below AP1) in Fig. 4.
The 3-antenna AP also needs to ensure that its transmission to one
client does not create interference at the other client. Since each
of its clients has two antennas and hence receives signals in a 2-
dimensional space, this goal can be achieved if the 3-antenna AP
ensures that each client receives the unwanted signal aligned along
the interference it already sees from the ongoing transmission of
the single-antenna client, (i.e., along p1), as shown in the bottom
graphs in Fig. 4.
3. n+’S DESIGN
n+ is a random access protocol that enables nodes with any num-
ber of antennas to contend for both time and degrees of freedom. It
also has bitrate selection built-in.
3.1 Overview
Similar to 802.11, in n+, nodes listen on the wireless medium
using carrier sense. If the channel is unoccupied, the nodes con-
tend for the medium using 802.11’s contention window and ran-
dom backoff [5]. The node pair that wins the contention exchanges
a light-weight RTS-CTS. The RTS-CTS allows nodes interested in
contending for the remaining degrees of freedom to compute the
channels to the receivers who won earlier contentions, in order to
perform the required alignment or nulling. The RTS-CTS also in-
cludes the number of antennas that will be used in the transmission.
After the RTS-CTS, the node pair proceeds to exchange the data
packet followed by the ACK.
Unlike 802.11, n+ allows nodes who have more antennas than
the current number of used degrees of freedom to contend for con-
current transmissions. The number of used degrees of freedom is
equal to the number of ongoing transmissions, which a node can
learn from prior RTS-CTS messages. As nodes contend for the un-
used degrees of freedom, they again use a contention window and
random backoff similar to 802.11. However, while carrier sensing,
nodes need to ignore the signals from past contention winners. To
do so, n+ leverages that multi-antenna nodes receive the signal in a
multi-dimensional space and, thus, can project on a space orthogo-
nal to ongoing transmissions from past contention winners. Due to
orthogonality, this space does not contain any interference from the
ongoing transmissions, and thus, allows the nodes to perform car-
rier sense as if there were no ongoing transmissions. The process
continues until all the degrees of freedom in the network have been
used.
To illustrate how this design works, let us consider again the net-
work in Fig. 3 which has three transmitter-receiver pairs. Each of
the three transmitters carrier senses the medium and contends for
the channel. Depending on who wins the contention, four differ-
ent scenarios are possible. Fig. 5(a) shows the scenario where the
3-antenna pair, tx3-rx3, wins the contention and ends up using all
three degrees of freedom. In this case, tx3 and rx3 exchange RTS-
CTS, informing other nodes that they will use three degrees of free-
dom in their transmission. Since the other two transmitters have
fewer than three antennas, they cannot support any additional de-
grees of freedom, and hence stop contending until the end of this
transmission.
In the second scenario shown in Fig. 5(b), the two-antenna pair,
tx2-rx2, wins the contention and uses two degrees of freedom. The
ﬁrst transmitter, tx1, notices that the channel is occupied and drops
out of contention since it has only a single antenna. The third trans-
mitter, tx3, on the other hand, has three antennas and therefore can
deliver an additional packet. So it contends for the medium and
wins the third degree of freedom. Since tx3 must not interfere with
the ongoing transmission of tx2-rx2, it nulls its signal on the two
antennas at rx2. This consumes two antennas at tx3, leaving it one
antenna to transmit one stream to its own receiver, rx3.
The third scenario in Fig. 5(c) occurs when tx1-rx1 wins the con-
tention. Since only a single degree of freedom is used, both tx2 and
tx3 contend for the remaining two degrees of freedom. If tx3 wins,
it needs to use one of its antennas to null its signal at rx1, which
leaves it two antennas to send two concurrent streams to its own
receiver, rx3, as in Fig. 5(c).
The last scenario shown in Fig. 5(d) occurs when the nodes win
contention in the following order: tx1-rx1, tx2-rx2, tx3-rx3. It is
similar to the example described in §2, where each of the pairs ends
up transmitting a single packet.
Finally, a few additional points are worth noting:
• n+ makes a node that joins ongoing transmissions end its trans-
mission at about the same time as prior transmissions, which it
learns from their light-weight RTS-CTS exchange. This design
choice forces the medium to become idle at the end of each joint
transmission, and hence prevents starving nodes that have only
one antenna. Requiring all nodes to end their concurrent trans-
missions with the ﬁrst contention winner means that nodes may
need to fragment or aggregate packets. Various link layer proto-
cols require packet fragmentation or aggregation. For example,
802.11n requires the driver to be able to aggregate multiple pack-
ets to create an aggregate frame [6], whereas old ATM networks
require packet fragmentation [17]. n+ leverages these methods.
• Instead of sending the ACKs one after the other, the receivers
transmit their ACKs concurrently. These concurrent transmis-
sions are analogous to the concurrent transmissions of the data
packets, and can be achieved using a combination of nulling and
alignment (see §3.3).
The above provides an overview of n+. The next few sections
explain how we realize this design. We ﬁrst develop the details of
the algorithms and the system architecture, and leave addressing
the practical issues until §4.
3.2 Carrier Sense Despite Ongoing Transmis-
sions
In n+, nodes use 802.11’s carrier sense to contend for additional
concurrent transmissions, even after some nodes have already won
earlier contention rounds and started their transmissions. For this
approach to work effectively, carrier sense should be oblivious to
the ongoing transmissions. n+ satisﬁes this constraint as follows: In
n+, a node that is interested in sensing the medium ﬁrst computes
the channel for the ongoing transmissions (which it does using the

Figure 5—Medium access for the three link scenario
preamble in their RTS messages). These channels deﬁne a sub-
space where the ongoing transmissions live. If the node projects on
a space orthogonal to this subspace (using standard algebra [23]),
the node will see no signal from ongoing transmissions, and hence
can perform standard 802.11 carrier sense.
We name this approach multi-dimensional carrier sense. To il-
lustrate how it works, consider again the example in Fig. 3, where
we have three pairs of nodes: a single-antenna pair tx1-rx1, a 2-
antenna pair tx2-rx2, and a 3-antenna pair tx3-rx3. Let us focus on
the 3-antenna transmitter, tx3, as it senses the medium.
Say the single-antenna transmitter, tx1, wins the ﬁrst round of
contention and is already transmitting some signal p, hence using
the ﬁrst degree of freedom. Say tx3 wants to contend for the second
degree of freedom. tx3 should sense the medium, but ignore the
signal p from tx1. To do so, tx3 ﬁrst computes the channel from tx1
to its three antennas using the preamble in tx1’s RTS. We refer to
these channels as h1, h2, and h3. Since tx3 has three antennas, the
received signal lies in a 3-dimensional space and can be written as:
~y = 0
@
y1
y2
y3
A = 0

A p = ~htx1p,
where ~htx1 is the channel vector [h1, h2, h3]T . Thus, for different
symbols p transmitted by tx1, the received signal at tx3 changes
over time, but merely moves along the one-dimensional vector ~htx1,
shown in Fig. 6(a). Therefore, by projecting on the 2-dimensional
subspace orthogonal to this vector, (the red plane in Fig. 6(a)), tx3
eliminates interference from tx1 and can carrier sense for the re-
maining degrees of freedom. Since a 2-dimensional subspace is
deﬁned by any two distinct vectors in it, tx3 can project on the
subspace orthogonal to p by simply picking any two vectors in the
subspace, e.g., ~w1 and ~w2, and projecting on them to get:
~w2 · ~y« ,
~y′ = „~w1 · ~y
where · denotes the dot product operation. If tx1’s signal, p, is the
only ongoing transmission, then ~y = ~htx1p, and by deﬁnition of
orthogonality, ~y′ = ~0. Thus, if tx3 performs carrier sense by sens-
ing the signal after projection, ~y′, it sees that the second degree of
freedom is still unoccupied.
Now, say transmitter tx2 wins the second degree of freedom and
starts transmitting its signal, q. Let h′
3 be the channels
from tx2 to tx3.3 The three antennas at tx3 now receive the follow-
2, and h′

A q = ~htx1p + ~htx2q,
where ~htx2 is the channel vector for the second transmission. How-
ever, since tx3 is carrier sensing in the 2-dimensional space orthog-
onal to tx1’s transmission, it computes:
~y′ = „~w1 · ~y
~w2 · ~y« = „~w1 · ~htx1p + ~w1 · ~htx2q
~w2 · ~htx1p + ~w2 · ~htx2q« = „~w1 · ~htx2
~w2 · ~htx2« q.
Thus, as opposed to the scenario in which only tx1 was transmit-
ting and tx3 saw that the second degree of freedom is unused, tx3
sees that now ~y′ 6= ~0, and hence the second degree of freedom is
occupied.
Further, since the signal ~y′ has no interference from tx1, and is
equal to tx2’s transmission, q, with a channel multiplier, tx3 can
decode q using standard decoders. This allows tx3 to carrier sense
not only by checking the power on the medium but also by cross
correlating the preamble as in today’s 802.11.
tx3 can use the same process to carrier sense and contend for
the third degree of freedom. The only difference is that now it has
to project on a space orthogonal to both tx1’s and tx2’s signals, as
shown in Fig. 6(b). Thus, to summarize, for any number of con-
current transmissions the signal lives in a hyper-plane of the same
dimension as the number of used degrees of freedom. To sense the
medium, the node projects on the space orthogonal to the ongoing
signals’ hyper-plane, and performs carrier sense in this space.
3.3 Transmitting with Concurrent Transmis-
sions
In n+, nodes that want to transmit in the presence of ongoing
transmissions have to ensure that they do not interfere with those
who already occupy the medium. This applies to the transmission
of RTS, CTS, data, and ACK packets. In all of these cases, the
approach is the same and relies on a combination of interference
