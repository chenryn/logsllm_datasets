How does the FTC respond to the 
Rise of the Machines? 
When 
machines 
are 
everywhere? 
What does the FTC do? 
Unfair 
Deceptive 
What do “unfair” and “deceptive” mean? 
•  Unfair =  
–  Substantial Injury to Consumers  
–  Unavoidable 
–  Not Outweighed Procompetitive By Benefits 
•  Deceptive =  
–  Act Likely to Mislead Consumers 
–  Unreasonable 
–  Material      
For Example …  
Facebook promised to keep personal info 
safe, but allowed 3rd party access 
Google promised Gmail contacts wouldn’t 
be used elsewhere, but used them in its 
social-media site, Buzz 
Snapchat promised images 
would disappear, but kept them 
For Example …  
Wyndham unfairly exposed consumers’ 
payment-card info in three separate data 
breaches 
ORACLE promised its updates would 
protect consumers, but didn’t protect older 
versions of Java SE. 
ASUS promised its routers would protect 
local network against attacks, but failed to 
update them enough 
How do we decide what cases to bring?

Research Wish List:  
What is the FTC looking for? 
We want… 
… Research on Privacy & Security 
•  What are the best ways to assess the risks 
posed by breaches and vulnerabilities?  
•  What can be done to protect consumers from 
ransomware, malvertising, etc? 
•  How can we tie exposed data to a specific 
breach?   
•  Can we make certain attacks less profitable?   
•  How can we better spot fraud? 
….Research on IoT Devices 
•  How can IoT device manufacturers and 
platforms ensure better IoT security? 
•  What defensive measures can prevent one 
vulnerable IoT device from compromising 
other devices on the same network? 
….Research on Emerging Trends 
•  How can sensor-based monitoring technologies 
protect the privacy of consumers, particularly 
children?   
•  How can engineers better isolate critical systems, 
such as a connected car’s CAN bus?    
•  When and how do consumers encounter bots, and 
are they aware of that fact?   
•  Does virtual reality raise new fraud, deception, or 
other consumer protection concerns? 
… Research on New Tools & Techniques 
•  Allow users to control their personal 
information across contexts 
•  Allow consumers to observe behavior and 
communication of their smart devices 
•  Analyze apps to determine practices 
associated with third-party libraries 
•  Detect discriminatory algorithms 
•  Identify tracking and cross-device tracking 
•  Identify vulnerable IoT devices
