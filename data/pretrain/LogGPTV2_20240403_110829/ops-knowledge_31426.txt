User: I write a very simple flask server. This server response to GET and give back my home.html.
I visit the site on 127.0.0.1:5000
everything is good till now.
However, if I keep pressing "fresh" (Command+R on my computer) a lot of times for a few second, as fast as I can, then, my flask give this error and breaks down.

Exception in thread Thread-1:

  IOError: [Errno 32] Broken pipe

I believe this is what happened: When my server was trying to transmit html to my browser, I pressed the refresh and broke the pipe. So my server got confused and then give error.
How to solve this problem? Or this site is not usable as all since anyone who ask constantly for my page can break my webpage down.
Thanks!
Assistant: This error appear because your server is overloaded! Stop and start it!
