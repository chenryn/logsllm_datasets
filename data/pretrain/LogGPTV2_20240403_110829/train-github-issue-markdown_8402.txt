There's a pretty obscure coding language out there called Sourcepawn, and I've
recently released a language package for it. The only problem now is that both
Sourcepawn and PHP use the `.inc` file type. I didn't include a
`firstLineMatch` for the Sourcepawn package because there's really no telling
what someone will decide to put for the first line (they could immediately
start with the code, or maybe a comment, or maybe a preprocessor...). Since
neither PHP nor Sourcepawn can definitively claim the file as its own, it
seems like PHP then takes precedence simply because it comes before Sourcepawn
in the alphabet (I haven't tested this, but it seems pretty plausible).
So, is there any way that the auto-detection of grammar could be improved by,
say, looking at the regex in each language and seeing which one lines up
better?
