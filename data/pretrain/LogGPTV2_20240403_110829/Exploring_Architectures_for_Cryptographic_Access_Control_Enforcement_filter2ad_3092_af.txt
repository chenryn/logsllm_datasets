Figure 4: Cloudify Blueprint Corresponding to arc∗ = {⟨proxyu, clientu⟩, ⟨ RM, CSP ⟩, ⟨ MS, CSP ⟩, ⟨ DS, CSP ⟩ }
B AN EXAMPLE OF CLOUDIFY BLUEPRINT
We report here the blueprint fragments composing the Cloudify
blueprint for the architectures arc∗ ∈ ARC that we considered for
the eGovernment scenario. Each white rectangle is a node and it
represents a cloud service (e.g., security groups, network gateways).
Links are relationships between nodes and are used to control the
deployment flow. For instance, a “depends_on” relationship from
a subnet to a network means that the network has to be deployed
first. The blueprint contains three fragments (blue borders). The
fragment on top models the MS entity as a Relational Database
Service in AWS, while the fragment in the middle models the RM as
a Lambda function in AWS. The last fragment on the bottom-right
corner models the DS as the S3 service in AWS. The proxy runs in
the users’ computers and therefore is not part of the blueprint.
