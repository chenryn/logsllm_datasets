(a) Non-personalized naming: the attack does not men-
tion the organization or recipient by name (“Dear
user, we have detected an error in your mailbox
settings...”)
(b) Organization speciﬁcally named: the attack men-
tions just the organization, but not the recipient
(“New secure email message from FooCorp...”)
(c) Recipient speciﬁcally named: the attack speciﬁ-
cally uses the victim’s name in the email (“Bob,
please review the attached purchase order...”)
Taken together, this taxonomy divides phishing content
into nine different classes of tailoring; Table 4 shows how
many of our dataset’s 180 incidents fall into each category.
From this categorization, two interesting observations emerge.
First, only 3 incidents (1.7%) actually address their recipients
by name. Since most ATOs (94%) in our dataset email at least
100 recipients, attackers would need to leverage some form
of automation to both send hundreds of individual emails and
customize the naming in each one. Based on our results, it
appears these attackers did not view that as a worthwhile in-
vestment. For example, they might fear that sending many
individual emails might trigger an anti-spam or anti-phishing
mechanism, which we observed in the case of one ATO who
attempted to send hundreds of individual emails. Second,

looking at the last column of Table 4, only 13 incidents (7%)
use targeted content in their messages. The overwhelming
majority (92.7%) of incidents opt for more generic messages
that an attacker could deploy at a large number of organiza-
tions with minimal changes (e.g., by only changing the name
of the victim organization).
While our attack dataset captures a limited view of all lat-
eral phishing attacks, it nonetheless reﬂects all known lateral
phishing incidents across 33 organizations over a 7-month
timeframe. Thus, despite the data’s limitations, our results
show that a substantial fraction of lateral phishers do not fully
draw upon their compromised account’s resources (i.e., his-
torical emails) to craft personalized spearphishing messages.
This ﬁnding suggests these attackers act more like an oppor-
tunistic cybercriminal, rather than an indomitable APT or
nation-state. However, given the arms-race and evolutionary
nature of security, these lateral phishers could in the future
increase the sophistication and potency of their attacks by
drawing upon the account’s prior emails to craft more tar-
geted content.
Thematic Content (Lures): When labeling each phishing
incident with a level of tailoring, we noticed that the phish-
ing messages in our dataset overwhelmingly relied on one
of two deceptive pretexts (lures): (1) an alarming message
that asserts some problem with the recipient’s account (and
urges them to follow a link to remediate the issue); and (2)
a message that notiﬁes the recipient of a new / updated /
shared document. For the latter ‘document’ lure, the nature
and speciﬁcity of the document varied with the level of con-
tent tailoring. For example, whereas an attack with generic
topic tailoring will just mention a vague document, attacks
that use enterprise-related tailoring will switch the terminol-
ogy to an invoice, purchase order, or some other generic but
work-related document.
To characterize this behavior further, we computed the most
frequently occurring words across our dataset’s phishing mes-
sages. First, we selected one phishing email per incident, to
prevent incidents with many identical emails from biasing
(inﬂating) the popularity of their lures. Next, we normalized
the text of each email: we removed auto-generated text (e.g.,
user signatures), lowercased all words, removed punctuation,
and discarded all non-common English words; all of these
can be done with open source libraries such as Talon [27] and
NLTK [5]. Finally, we built a set of all words that occurred
in any phishing email across our incidents and counted how
many incidents each word appeared in.
Interestingly, our dataset’s phishing messages draw on a
relatively small pool of words: there are just 444 distinct, com-
mon English words across the texts of every phishing message
in our dataset (i.e., every phishing email’s text consists of an
arrangement from this set of 444 words). In contrast, a ran-
dom sample of 1,000 emails from our dataset contained a
total of 2,516 distinct words, and only 176 of these emails
consisted entirely of words from the phishing term set.
Beyond this small set of total words across lateral phishing
emails, all but one incident contained at least one of the top
20 words, illustrating the reliance on the two major lures we
identiﬁed. Our extended technical report shows the occur-
rence distribution of each word [17]. Focusing on just the top
ten words and the number incidents that use them (Table 5),
the dominance of these two thematic lures becomes apparent.
Words indicative of the “shared document” lure, such as ‘doc-
ument’, ‘view’, ‘attach’, and ‘review’, each occur in over 23%
of incidents, with the most popular (document) occurring in
nearly half of all incidents. Similarly, we also see many words
from the account-related lure in the top ten: ‘access’, ‘sign’
(from ‘sign on’), and ‘account’.
Overall, while our dataset contains several instances of
targeted phishing messages, the majority of the lateral phish-
ing emails we observe rely on more mundane lures that an
attacker can reuse across multiple organizations with little ef-
fort. The fact that we see this behavior recur across dozens of
different organizations suggests either the emergence of a new,
yet accessible, form of enterprise phishing, or an evolution in
the way “ordinary” cybercriminals execute phishing attacks
(moving from external accounts that use clever spooﬁng to
compromised, yet legitimate accounts).
6.4 Temporal Aspects of Lateral Phishing
Because attackers might not live or operate in the same geo-
graphic region as the hijacked account, prior work has sug-
gested using features that capture unusual timing properties
inherent in phishing emails [11, 15, 41]. Contrary to this in-
tuition, in our dataset most lateral phishing attacks occur at
“normal” times of the day and week. First, for 98% of lateral
phishing incidents, the attacker sent the phishing email dur-

historical emails. Out of the 180 incidents, 15 incidents were
sent by an “inactive” (quiescent) ATO that sent zero emails
across all 30 days preceding their lateral phishing emails; Fig-
ure 8 excludes these incidents. Of the remaining 165 incidents
sent by an active ATO, 18 incidents fall completely outside of
the hijacked account’s historical operating hours, which sug-
gests that a feature looking for emails sent at atypical times
for a user could help detect these attacks. However, for the
remaining 147 incidents, the phishing emails’ hour-of-day
evenly cover the full percentile range. As shown in Figure 8,
the percentile distribution of phishing hours closely resem-
bles the CDF of a uniformly random distribution (a straight
y = x line); i.e., the phishing email’s hour-of-day appears to
be randomly drawn from the true account’s historical hour-
of-day distribution. This result indicates that for the majority
of incidents in our dataset (147 out of 180), the time of day
when the ATO sent the attack will not provide a signiﬁcant
signal, since their sent-times mirror the timing distribution of
the true user’s historical email activity.
Thus, based on the attacks in our dataset, we ﬁnd that two
weak timing-related features exist: searching for quiescent
accounts that suddenly begin to send suspicious emails (15 in-
cidents), and searching for suspicious emails sent completely
outside of an account’s historically active time window (18
incidents). Beyond these two features and the small fraction
of phishing attacks they reﬂect, neither the day of the week
nor the time of day provide signiﬁcant signals for detection.
6.5 Attacker Sophistication
Since most of our dataset’s lateral phishers do not mine the
hijacked account’s mailbox to craft targeted messages, one
might naturally conclude that these attackers are lazy or unso-
phisticated. However, in this subsection, we identify two kinds
of sophisticated behavior that required some investment of
additional time and manual effort: attackers who continually
engage with their attack’s recipients in an effort to increase
the attack’s success rate, and attackers who actively “clean
up” traces of their phishing activity in an attempt to hide their
presence from the account’s legitimate owner. In contrast to
the small number of attackers who invested time in crafting
tailored phishing messages to a personalized set of recipients,
nearly one-third (31%) of attackers engage in at least one of
these two sophisticated behaviors.
Interaction with potential victims: Upon receiving a phish-
ing message, some recipients naturally question the email’s
validity and send a reply asking for more information or as-
surances. While a lazy attacker might ignore these recipients’
replies, 27 ATOs across 15 organizations actively engaged
with these potential victims by sending follow-up messages
assuring the victim of the phishing email’s legitimacy. For ex-
ample, at one organization, an attacker consistently sent brief
follow-up messages such as “Yes I sent it to you” or “Yes,

which the ATO’s benign emails in the preceding 30 days were sent.

email within the 30 days preceding their lateral phishing email.
ing a weekday. Additionally, the majority of attackers in our
dataset send their phishing emails during the true account’s
normal working hours.
Day of the Week: From Figure 7, all but three lateral phish-
ing incidents occurred during a work day (Monday–Friday).
This pattern suggests that attackers send their phishing emails
on the same days when employees typically send their benign
emails, and that the day of the week will provide an ineffec-
tive or weak detection signal. Moreover, 67% of incidents
occur in the ﬁrst half of the week (Mon–Wed), indicating that
the lateral phishers in our dataset do not follow the folklore
strategy where attackers favor launching their attacks on Fri-
day (hoping to capitalize on reduced security team operations
over the coming weekend) [37].
Time (Hour) of Day: In addition to operating during the
usual work week, most attackers tend to send their lateral
phishing emails during the typical working hours of their hi-
jacked accounts. To assess the (ab)normality of an attack’s
sent-time, for each ATO, we gathered all of the emails that the
account sent in the 30 days prior to their ﬁrst lateral phishing
email. We then mapped the sent-time of each of these histori-
cal (and presumably benign) emails to the hour-of-day on a 24
hour scale, thus forming a distribution of the typical hour-of-
day in which each hijacked account usually sent their emails.
Finally, for each lateral phishing incident, we computed the
percentile for the phishing email’s hour-of-day relative to the
hour-of-day distribution for the ATO’s historical emails. For
example, phishing incidents with a percentile of 0 or 100 were
sent at an earlier or later hour-of-day than any email that the
true account’s owner sent in the preceding 30 days.
Across all lateral phishing incidents sent by an active ATO,

with signiﬁcantly more elaborate ruses: e.g., “Hi [Bob], its
a document about [X]. It’s safe to open. You can view it by
logging in with your email address and password.”
To ﬁnd instances where a phisher actively followed-up
with their attack’s potential victims, we gathered all of the
messages in every lateral phishing email thread and checked to
see if the attacker ever received and responded to a recipient’s
reply (inquiry).8 In total, we found that 107 ATOs received
at least one reply from a recipient. Of these reply-receiving
attackers, 27 ATOs (25%) sent a deceptive follow-up response
to one or more of their recipients’ inquiries.
Stealthiness: Separate from interacting with their potential
victims, attackers might expend manual effort to hide their
presence from the account’s true owner by removing any
traces of their phishing emails, particularly since lateral phish-
ers appear to operate during the hijacked account’s normal
working hours (§ 6.4). To estimate the number of these ATOs,
we searched for whether any of the following emails ended
up in the hijacked account’s Trash folder, and were deleted
within 30 seconds of being sent or received: any phishing
emails, replies to phishing emails, or follow-up emails sent by
the attacker. The 30 second threshold distinguishes stealthy
behavior from deletion resulting from remediation of the com-
promised account. In total, 30 attackers across 16 organiza-
tions engage in this kind of evasive clean-up behavior.
Of the 27 ATOs who interactively responded to inquiries
about their attack, only 9 also exhibited this stealthy clean-up
behavior. Thus, counting the number of attackers across both
sets, 48 ATOs engaged in at least one of these behaviors.
The sizeable fraction of attackers who engage in a sophisti-
cated behavior creates a more complex picture of the attacks
in our dataset. Given that these attackers do invest dedicated
and (often) manual effort in enhancing the success of their
attacks, why do so many of them (over 90% in our dataset)
use non-targeted phishing content and target dozens to hun-
dreds of recipients? One plausible reason for this generic
behavior is that the simple methods they currently use work
well enough under their economic model: investing additional
time to develop more tailored phishing emails just does not
provide enough economic value. Another reason might be
that growth of lateral phishing attacks reﬂects an evolution
in the space of phishing, where previously “simple” exter-
nal phishers have moved to sending their attacks via lateral
phishing because attacks from (spoofed) external accounts
have become too difﬁcult, due to user awareness and/or better
technical mitigations against external phishing. Ultimately,
based on our work’s dataset, we cannot soundly answer why
so many lateral phishers employ simple attacks, and leave it
as an interesting question for future work to explore.

7 Summary
In this work we presented the ﬁrst large-scale characteriza-
tion of lateral phishing attacks across more than 100 million
employee-sent emails from 92 enterprise organizations. We
also developed and evaluated a new detector that found many
known lateral phishing attacks, as well as dozens of unre-
ported attacks, while generating a low volume of false posi-
tives. Through a detailed analysis of the attacks in our dataset,
we uncovered a number of important ﬁndings that inform
our mental models of the threats enterprises face, and illu-
minate directions for future defenses. Our work showed that
14% of our randomly sampled organizations, ranging from
small to large, experienced lateral phishing attacks within
a seven-month time period, and that attackers succeeded in
compromising new accounts at least 11% of the time. We
uncovered and quantiﬁed several thematic recipient targeting
