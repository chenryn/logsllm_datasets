### Reproducing code example:
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt;
Before this happened I was running a different python script, which used 89
processes. Unfortunately I cannot share that script publicly. Since then numpy
crashes after import immediately.

    IMPORTANT: PLEASE READ THIS FOR ADVICE ON HOW TO SOLVE THIS ISSUE!
    Importing the numpy c-extensions failed.
    - Try uninstalling and reinstalling numpy.
    - If you have already done that, then:
      1. Check that you expected to use Python3.6 from "/usr/bin/python3",
         and that you have no directories in your PATH or PYTHONPATH that can
         interfere with the Python and numpy version "1.17.2" you're trying to use.
      2. If (1) looks fine, you can open a new issue at
         https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues.  Please include details on:
         - how you installed Python
         - how you installed numpy
         - your operating system
         - whether or not you have multiple versions of Python installed
         - if you built from source, your compiler versions and ideally a build log
    - If you're working with a numpy git repository, try `git clean -xdf`
      (removes all files not under version control) and rebuild numpy.
    Note: this error has many possible causes, so please don't comment on
    an existing issue about this - open a new one instead.
    Original error was: PyCapsule_Import could not import module "datetime"
    zsh: segmentation fault  python3 temp.py
