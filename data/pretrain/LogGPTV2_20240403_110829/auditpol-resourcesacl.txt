auditpol resourceSACL
Applies to: Windows Server 2022, Windows Server 2019, Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2
Configures global resource system access control lists (SACLs).
To perform resourceSACL operations, you must have Write or Full Control permissions for that object set in the security descriptor. You can also perform resourceSACL operations if you have the Manage auditing and security log (SeSecurityPrivilege) user right.
Syntax
auditpol /resourceSACL
[/set /type: [/success] [/failure] /user: [/access:]]
[/remove /type: /user: [/type:]]
[/clear [/type:]]
[/view [/user:] [/type:]]
Parameters
Parameter
Description
/set
Adds a new entry to or updates an existing entry in the resource SACL for the resource type specified.
/remove
Removes all entries for the given user in the global object access auditing  list.
/clear
Removes all entries from the global object access auditing list.
/view
Lists the global object access auditing entries in a resource SACL. The user and resource types are optional.
/?
Displays help at the command prompt.
Arguments
Argument
Description
/type
The resource for which object access auditing is being configured. The supported, case-sensitive, argument values are File (for directories and files) and Key (for registry keys).
/success
Specifies success auditing.
/failure
Specifies failure auditing.
/user
Specifies a user in one of the following forms: DomainName\Account (such as DOM\Administrators)StandaloneServer\Group Account (see LookupAccountName function){S-1-x-x-x-x} (x is expressed in decimal, and the entire SID must be enclosed in curly braces). For example: {S-1-5-21-5624481-130208933-164394174-1001}Note: If the SID form is used, no check is done to verify the existence of this account.
/access
Specifies a permission mask that can be specified through:Generic access rights, including:GA - GENERIC ALLGR - GENERIC READGW - GENERIC WRITEGX - GENERIC EXECUTEAccess rights for files, including:FA - FILE ALL ACCESSFR - FILE GENERIC READFW - FILE GENERIC WRITEFX - FILE GENERIC EXECUTEAccess rights for registry keys, including:KA - KEY ALL ACCESSKR - KEY READKW - KEY WRITEKX - KEY EXECUTEFor example: /access:FRFW enables audit events for read and write operations.A hexadecimal value representing the access mask (such as 0x1200a9)This is useful when using resource-specific bit masks that are not part of the security descriptor definition language (SDDL) standard. If omitted, Full access is used.
Note: If the SID form is used, no check is done to verify the existence of this account.

Examples
To set a global resource SACL to audit successful access attempts by a user on a registry key:
auditpol /resourceSACL /set /type:Key /user:MYDOMAIN\myuser /success
To set a global resource SACL to audit successful and failed attempts by a user to perform generic read and write functions on files or folders:
auditpol /resourceSACL /set /type:File /user:MYDOMAIN\myuser /success /failure /access:FRFW
To remove all global resource SACL entries for files or folders:
auditpol /resourceSACL /type:File /clear
To remove all global resource SACL entries for a particular user from files or folders:
auditpol /resourceSACL /remove /type:File /user:{S-1-5-21-56248481-1302087933-1644394174-1001}
To list the global object access auditing entries set on files or folders:
auditpol /resourceSACL /type:File /view
To list the global object access auditing entries for a particular user that are set on files or folders:
auditpol /resourceSACL /type:File /view /user:MYDOMAIN\myuser
