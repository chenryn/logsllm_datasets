##### ANSIBLE VERSION
    $ ansible --version
    ansible 2.1.0.0
##### OS / ENVIRONMENT

##### SUMMARY
Ubuntu 16 comes without `aptitude` package:
     "Could not find aptitude. Please ensure it is installed."
##### STEPS TO REPRODUCE
Tasks with `upgrade` parameter fails:
    ~/ansible-scripts $ ansible -i inventory/hosts lab -m apt -a "upgrade=full"
    lab.xxx | FAILED! => {
        "changed": false, 
        "failed": true, 
        "msg": "Could not find aptitude. Please ensure it is installed."
    }
    ~/ansible-scripts $ ansible -i inventory/hosts lab -m apt -a "upgrade=yes"
    lab.xxx | FAILED! => {
        "changed": false, 
        "failed": true, 
        "msg": "Could not find aptitude. Please ensure it is installed."
    }
    ~/ansible-scripts $ ansible -i inventory/hosts lab -m apt -a "upgrade=full"
    lab.xxx | FAILED! => {
        "changed": false, 
        "failed": true, 
        "msg": "Could not find aptitude. Please ensure it is installed."
    }
    ~/ansible-scripts $ ansible -i inventory/hosts lab -m apt -a "upgrade=safe"
    lab.xxx | FAILED! => {
        "changed": false, 
        "failed": true, 
        "msg": "Could not find aptitude. Please ensure it is installed."
    }
Only `upgrade=dist` work fine:
    ~/ansible-scripts $ ansible -i inventory/hosts lab -m apt -a "upgrade=dist"
    lab.xxx | SUCCESS => {
        "changed": false, 
        "msg": "Reading package lists...\nBuilding dependency tree...\nReading state information...\nCalculating upgrade...\n0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.\n", 
        "stderr": "", 
        "stdout": "Reading package lists...\nBuilding dependency tree...\nReading state information...\nCalculating upgrade...\n0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.\n", 
        "stdout_lines": [
            "Reading package lists...", 
            "Building dependency tree...", 
            "Reading state information...", 
            "Calculating upgrade...", 
            "0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded."
        ]
    }
