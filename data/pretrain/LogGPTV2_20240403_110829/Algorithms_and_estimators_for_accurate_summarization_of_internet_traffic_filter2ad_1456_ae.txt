7.4 Controlling the number of rate
adaptations
We sweep the parameter μ, which controls the rate of decrease
of the sampling rate, and through it, the total number of rate adap-
tations performed. We expect the (absolute value of the) relative
error of the estimates to increase when μ is decreased, as fewer
packets are counted and reﬂected in the ﬁnal sketch. On the other
hand, the number of rate adaptations performed and the size of in-
termediate temporary storage needed to store the count vectors for
SNF and SSH should decrease with μ. The effectiveness of the

parameter μ and the feasibility of a router implementation depends
on this tradeoff.
Figure 7 shows the dependence of the average absolute value
of the relative error on the parameter μ. We can see that there is
minimal performance loss in terms of estimate quality when μ is
reduced from 0.9 to 0.5.
Figure 8 shows that selecting a smaller μ = 0.5 is very effective.
First, the number of rate adaptations is much smaller, and secondly,
the size of intermediate temporary storage needed for collecting the
count vectors, is much smaller with μ = 0.5 than with μ = 0.9.

8. DEFERRED PROOFS
The adjusted weights we assign are a function of the observed
count of the ﬂow and the sampling rate. The sampling rate (effec-
tive sampling rate or sampling rate steps) in the adaptive algorithms
is treated as ﬁxed because for any ﬂow f, it is determined by the
