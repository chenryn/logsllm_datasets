# Environment
    Windows build number: Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.18363.836]
    PowerToys version: Release v0.18.1
    PowerToy module for which you are reporting the bug (if applicable): FancyZones
    GeForce 1070 with driver Nvidia 445.87 (German)
# Steps to reproduce
Setup FancyZones (I have a multi-monitor-setup with three monitors of
different resolutions each).  
Leave your PC and wait for your Screens to go into sleep mode.  
Reactivate the system.
# Expected behavior
The drop zones remain transparent and you can see the background through them
when moving windows with pressed [Shift].
# Actual behavior
The tiles representing the zones where you can drop windows into loose their
transparency. In rare cases even the whole background is set to black.
