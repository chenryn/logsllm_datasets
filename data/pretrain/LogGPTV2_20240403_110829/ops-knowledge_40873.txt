Question: You are working with RSA signatures and have been given two large odd prime numbers p and q. You need to compute a number d satisfying the condition 3d = 1 mod phi(pq). Which of the following must be true to successfully compute d and what is a direct consequence of computing it?
"A": "Primes p and q must satisfy p = 2 mod 3 and q = 2 mod 3, and once d is computed, it can be used to efficiently compute inverses modulo n.",
"B": "Primes p and q must be congruent to 1 mod 4, and computing d allows one to find the totient function phi(pq).",
"C": "It is necessary for p and q to be twin primes, and computing d will enable the decryption of messages encrypted with RSA.",
"D": "No specific congruence relationships are required for p and q, and computing d makes it possible to factorize n."
Answer: A
