User: How to automatically scale AWS EC2 instances to meet traffic demands?
Assistant: AWS EC2 instances can use auto scaling groups to automatically scale to meet traffic demands. By setting up an auto-scaling group, the number of EC2 instances can be automatically increased or decreased when needed to meet traffic demands while avoiding resource waste. The following are the steps to set up an Auto Scaling group: 1. Create an Auto Scaling group In the AWS console, select the Auto Scaling group, and click "Create Auto Scaling group". Select the EC2 instances to autoscale, set the minimum and maximum number of instances, an optional launch configuration, and a scaling policy to use for autoscaling. The minimum number of instances refers to how many EC2 instances are guaranteed to be running all the time, while the maximum number of instances refers to the number of EC2 instances in the maximum case. 2. Set the automatic scaling policy The number of EC2 instances in the Auto Scaling group can be controlled by setting the automatic scaling policy. It can be automatically scaled according to indicators such as CPU usage and network load. Autoscaling policies can set various adjustment types, such as increasing or decreasing a specified number of instances or adjusting the number of instances based on an event that occurs. 3. Monitor the Auto Scaling group After the Auto Scaling group is created, you can monitor the EC2 instances of the Auto Scaling group through CloudWatch. CloudWatch can monitor indicators such as CPU usage and network load of EC2 instances, and can automatically trigger auto-scaling policies when certain thresholds are reached. Through the above steps, you can configure automatic scaling of AWS EC2 instances to meet traffic demands and avoid resource waste.
