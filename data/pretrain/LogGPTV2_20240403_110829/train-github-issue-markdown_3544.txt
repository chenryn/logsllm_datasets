**Migrated issue, originally created by Adrian (@thiefmaster)**
Probably a bit early since 9.5 isn't out yet, but once it's out this would be
pretty useful.

This could be a table arg, e.g. `postgres_onconflict='nothing|update'` (or
maybe even in a less db-specific way if other databases also support this
feature). When set it would automatically add it to INSERTs involving that
table.
