## 1. Technology Trends

### 1.1. Malicious Code Trends

#### 1.1.1. Anti-analysis Tactics Become More Restrictive

In 2010, iDefense observed an increase in malware samples that incorporated anti-analysis tactics. These techniques are designed to frustrate individuals attempting to analyze the code. The tactics observed included virtual machine (VM) detection, sandbox detection, and hardware-locking mechanisms.

While VM and sandbox-detection techniques are not new, iDefense noted a rise in the number of malware families employing these methods. For example, the Mariposa Trojan (BFBot) initially checked for sandbox artifacts and debugger presence in 2009. By July 2010, it had added checks for video card drivers associated with virtual machines. This suggests that malware authors see the value in including VM detection in their code.

Even less sophisticated malware, such as a dropper Trojan that installs a click-fraud Trojan, has begun using VM detection. The following code snippet from a dropper Trojan demonstrates how it detects a VMware environment:

```assembly
// Moves “VX” into EDX, then uses the VM ComChannel “IN” command 
004012FB . BA 58560000 MOV EDX,5658 
00401300 . ED IN EAX,DX 
00401301 . 90 NOP 
00401302 . 87D9 XCHG ECX,EBX 
00401304 . 87CB XCHG EBX,ECX 
// Checks to see if EBX has “VMXh” in it, if true it terminates 
00401306 . 81FB 68584D56 CMP EBX,564D5868
```

In addition to VM detection, iDefense observed malware that locks itself to a specific system to prevent analysis on another system. The Zeus banking Trojan, particularly versions 2 and later, includes a hardware-locking mechanism. This mechanism modifies the Trojan to run only on the infected system by comparing unique system information stored in the binary with the same information on the system. If there are any differences, the Trojan terminates. This technique significantly increases the effort required to analyze the sample on an analysis system.

The increasing use of anti-analysis tactics indicates that malware developers have weighed the pros and cons. While these tactics may limit the number of systems the malware can infect, they also help avoid detection and analysis. This shift suggests that malware is evolving from a focus on rapid spread to one on stealth. iDefense predicts that at least one major family will emerge in 2011 with even stricter anti-analysis tactics.

#### 1.1.2. Mobile Malware

Mobile devices are increasingly used for sending emails, online banking, and storing personal information. New applications track health, fitness, barcodes, and time management, making mobile platforms more attractive. Modern mobile devices can track real-time global positions, facing direction, and gravitational forces, enhancing user interaction with both the real and electronic worlds. iDefense first identified mobile platforms as a security disruptor in 2007.

Mobile operating system vendors and telecommunications companies aim to control the applications users can run on their devices, often to comply with laws, limit bandwidth usage, reduce maintenance costs, and capitalize on existing communications like SMS. However, users want to install new applications without permission, and the community interested in jailbreaking devices has grown. Jailbreaking is now legal, according to the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), which may lead to more efforts to subvert security controls.

In August 2010, jailbreakme.com released code to jailbreak iPhones by simply visiting the website. The code uses a zero-day exploit to disable security measures and enable non-official applications. This ease of jailbreaking demonstrates that even novice users can jailbreak their devices. If attackers had this information, they could write a mobile worm that spreads to other phone contacts after jailbreaking. However, the jailbreaking community's intent is largely not malicious, though they are more active than attackers in developing exploits for mobile devices.

Jailbroken phones are less secure, which could attract more attackers. Financially motivated attacks on mobile devices include installing applications that make calls to premium-rate numbers and working with banking Trojans. In September 2010, iDefense received samples of a Zeus binary that targets certain UK mobile phones. The binary injects HTML into banking websites to convince users to install an application on their mobile phones, which then monitors SMS messages and relays them to an attacker’s UK phone number to defeat one-time-password (OTP) challenges.

The mobile market remains segmented, with choices like iPhone, Android, Symbian, BlackBerry, and Windows Mobile. In 2010, US users purchased more Android devices than iPhones. Android’s less controlled app store may contribute to its popularity. iDefense predicts that at least one malicious application in the Android store will receive 50,000 downloads in 2011.

#### 1.1.3. Malware and 64-bit Platforms

64-bit processors, once rare, have become standard in even the least expensive laptops. The primary advantage is a larger address space for memory, allowing computers to support more than 4 GB of RAM. While 64-bit versions of Windows XP and Vista exist, their adoption is low compared to Windows 7. In July 2010, 46% of Windows 7 installations used the 64-bit version, compared to 11% for Windows Vista and less than 1% for Windows XP. As more users adopt Windows 7, 64-bit versions will become more prevalent.

This shift will force malware authors to adapt, as 64-bit versions of Windows include additional security features, such as Kernel Patch Protection (KPP) or PatchGuard. KPP prevents 64-bit versions of Windows from loading unsigned kernel drivers. Rootkits, which often require access to the kernel, will need to evolve. Possible tactics include:

1. **Using legitimate code-signing certificates**: The Stuxnet worm used stolen certificates from Realtek Semiconductor and JMicron.
2. **Disabling KPP**: The TDL3 rootkit overwrites the master boot record (MBR) to disable KPP and load the rootkit driver.
3. **User-mode rootkits**: These operate above the kernel and are easier to detect but still hide files and system modifications.

In 2011, more rootkits are likely to target 64-bit versions of Windows using these tactics. If attackers do not adapt, their code will fail to operate on many systems.

#### 1.1.4. Low-Distribution (APT) Malware Hiding in Plain Sight

Most modern malware uses packing to obfuscate functionality and evade detection by antivirus (AV) programs. While effective, some packers are so common that AV engines detect the packer code itself. AV programs also use heuristics to detect suspicious activity, such as when a program accesses the memory of other programs and creates remote threads.

Widely distributed malware, such as that used in spam or online banking credential theft, must use packing algorithms to hide its behavior. Conversely, malware distributed in small numbers, such as in targeted APT attacks, often uses no packing. Instead, it mimics legitimate programs to evade detection.

For example, the DNSCalc malware, reported by iDefense in May 2010, uses unobfuscated functionality and filenames like "windfvsrv.exe" and installs itself as a Windows service. It acts as a simple backdoor, avoiding detectably malicious activities. By not using typical malware techniques, these programs can remain undetected for extended periods.

### 1.2. Vulnerability Trends

#### 1.2.1. Increase in Out-of-Band Patches from Notable Software Vendors

iDefense’s 2010 Trends Report highlighted the burden of patch alignment, with vendors releasing security updates on the second Tuesday of the month, coinciding with Microsoft’s monthly Security Bulletin. In 2010, iDefense observed an unusual number of out-of-band (OOB) patch releases from notable vendors like Microsoft, Oracle, Cisco, Adobe, and SAP. This indicates a quick response to vulnerabilities, but data shows that zero-day vulnerabilities are driving these OOB patches.

From 2004 to 2009, Microsoft released six OOB security bulletins, while in 2010 alone, it released four. Most of these OOB bulletins were in response to exploits or malware. This trend signifies the increasing prevalence of zero-day vulnerabilities across a broader range of products.
