User: I have started using pythonbrew to manage different Python installs.  The main reason I wanted to do this is to install third party modules without affecting my system's Python install.
Fore example I thought I would install the requests library using:
pip install requests
However this causes an error saying:
error: could not create '/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/requests': Permission denied
Obviously I don't want to install it to the system's Python which is Python 2.7.3.  I did have to install pip with my package manager and the resultant path is /usr/bin/pip.  
How can I use pip to install to my pythonbrew installs?  (My current pythonbrew Python version is 3.3.0) Am I missing something?
Assistant: I found a solution.  I uninstalled my Python 3.3.0 by issuing pythonbrew uninstall 3.3.0.  Then I installed it again with pythonbrew install --configure="--with-zlib" 3.3.0.  This allowed pip to install and thus now I can use it to install to this Python version.
Maybe somebody else can find this helpful, cheers!
