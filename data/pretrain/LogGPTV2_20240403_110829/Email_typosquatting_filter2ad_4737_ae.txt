Typosquatting domains and email acceptance. Table 5 presents
the results of our first experiment, in which we monitored whether
our honey emails were accepted. 1,170 publicly registered domains
accepted our emails without any error message. Based on our ac-
cess logs, three of these domains, including two (outfook.com, and
uutlook.com) that seem to be clear typosquatting domains, ap-
pear to have read our emails. On the other hand, we experienced a
large percentage of network errors and timeouts for the majority
of publicly registered domains.
Table 6 shows that 95% of the domains which accepted our emails
without errors rely on eight mail server domains, which are all
privately registered.
Honey tokens and honey accounts. While the pilot measure-
ment – sending data to 738 domains only – did not result in any
signal being sent back to us, our larger measurement to all 7,269
suspected typosquatting domains resulted in 15 emails being appar-
ently opened and/or read by someone, and two honey tokens being
accessed. Here too, we saw a lag of several hours between the time
we sent emails and the time they were opened or read, suggesting
human involvement.

Specifically, on June 16, 2017 a potential typosqatter read the
“tax document” we had uploaded to a known document sharing
service. The domain we sent this honey email to was a legitimate
service once, but for the past two years it has been operating as
a parked domain. Logs provided by the document sharing service
indicate that the document was opened half an hour after we sent
it, and was viewed for 28 seconds from Caracas, Venezuela using a
Windows desktop computer. We also saw that 9 days later someone
read our email from another IP also from Caracas, Venezuela and
14 days later from Orlando, Florida.
Likewise, on June 16, 2017 a potential typosquatter tried to gain
access to our honey shell account from an IP in Poland. This spe-
cific email did not show up in our logs as having been viewed,
presumably due to the miscreant not opening inlined images.
While interesting, we caution that these two anecdotes are far
from providing evidence of systematic email collection and mone-
tization by typosquatters—in fact, given the number of emails we
sent, it seems that these practices are the (rare) exception rather
than the norm.
This overall negative result may be explained by several factors.
First, the risk involved with getting caught might be higher then the
expected benefit of the sensitive information we sent them. Second,
it is possible that typosquatters do not even realize that they are
collecting these emails; plausibly, the SMTP servers could have
been turned on by default, and not wilfully. After all these domains
might have been registered primarily for web typosquatting, with
email typosquatting being an afterthought, if a thought at all.
8 DISCUSSION AND LIMITATIONS
A major limitation of this study is that it only considers domain ty-
posquatting, and not username typosquatting. For instance aliec@
gmail.com might receive a lot of email meant for alice@gmail.
com. However, without the collaboration of the email service provider,
doing an analysis of username typosquatting is impossible.
Our data collection experiments show that there is potential
danger, but, contrary to web typosquatting, the “expected” risk to
consumers is far less obvious – most of the time, the risk is probably
very low, but in a few cases, depending on the specific content that
is being sent, might lead to disastrous outcomes (contrary to web
typosquatting).
While we have seen only scant evidence of credential abuse in
the wild when we posed as victims, we have on the other hand
discovered highly suspicious registration patterns. These may be a
by-product of web typosquatting, but we cannot rule out that the
situation will not change; the infrastructure appears to be certainly
already in place, even though this may be accidental.
Web vs. email typosquatting. Web typosquatting is one of the
easiest attacks to carry out, because it requires almost no technical
knowledge. As our measurements show, some parties are seemingly
interested in exploiting typing mistakes and have the ability to
collect emails from potential victims. Yet, they don’t appear to act
upon these emails, even though there is plenty of evidence (from
our data collection) that many people actually could fall victim to
this kind of attack.
Reflecting more on this negative result, web typosquatting only
needs the ability to register a domain and the subscription to a
parking service, and is thus accessible to any miscreant. On the
other hand, email typosquatting requires deeper technical expertise.
First, the collection infrastructure is not straightforward to set
up. Second, spam filtering is equally complex—as we saw in our
own experiment, spam filters alone might not be very reliable.
To add insult to the injury, the payoff is far more uncertain (low
occurrence, high payoff) than in the web typosquatting case (high
occurrence, low payoff), and the risk of getting in trouble (e.g., if
abusing financial credentials) is much higher.
Possible defenses. What if the situation were to change, and ty-
posquatters actually used emails received for profit? Our results in
Section 4.4 shown that far more emails are received by typosquat-
ting domains targeting top email service providers compared to
middle sized providers. This trivially means that large providers
registering their typosquatting domains defensively would have
the biggest impact per defensive registration and also it would
be the most cost effective per user. While for a small company it
might be financially burdensome to register hundreds of domains
(not mentioning the legal costs in case the domains are owned by
someone else), for major companies, a few thousand dollars a year
should be a negligible cost. It is not unprecedented for a large com-
pany to acquire typosquatting domains in bulk even if legal lawsuit
is needed. Facebook a few years ago won a lawsuit summing to
$2.8 million against typosquatters, recovering 105 typo domains.
UDRP and ACPA provide frameworks for brand owners to acquire
typosquatting domain names, in case they are already owned by
typosquatters. Similarly these costs should be low compared to the
potential harm for the financial sector such as banking domains.
Besides defensive domain registrations, typo correction tools
could also help to reduce the potential harm from typosquatting.
Typo correction could be integrated into any input field: at SMTP
setup phase, registrations, email recipient, or when giving contact
information in online forms.
Policy interventions could also be viable. For instance, the Chi-
nese registry raised the registration price and requiring identifica-
tion for .cn domains. Raising the cost of domain registration and
requiring identification for registration would definitely drive most
of the typosquatters out of business. However these intervention
would potentially have a high collateral damage on legitimate do-
main owners. Another approach would be for ICANN and registrars
to periodically remove typosquatting domains. This however is un-
likely to happen due to incentive misalignments, namely that this
would require a great effort from this parties who do not suffer from
this activity and at the same time their revenue would decrease.
9 CONCLUSION
We conducted a measurement study of email typosquatting, based
on our own data collection, and an examination of the whole ecosys-
tem. We conclude that the profitability of a typosquatting domain
depends on three main factors: popularity of target domain, edit
distance from target domain, and visual distance from the target do-
mains. We observed that receiver and reflection typo emails are an
order of magnitude more frequent than SMTP typo emails. Among
the emails received we found users accidentally sending us email
containing highly sensitive personal data. We also observed that
some registrants own thousands of email typosquatting domains,

that these domains support SMTP. Furthermore, some of the name
servers (and registrars) used by tens of thousands of typosquatting
domains appear to be cesspools, with a 5–10 higher typosquatting
domain ratio than normal. Even though typosquatters have the
infrastructure to collect private emails in bulk literally for pennies
each, we found that, with very rare exceptions, they do not actually
misuse sensitive information sent to them. We conjecture this may
be due to incentives being in favor of web typosquatting—shortly
stated, it is not worth bothering with a more complex attack with a
more uncertain payoff—but cannot guarantee the situation will not
change. Certainly, the potential for monetization by a determined
actor is there, and proactive defenses ought to be considered.
