## Experiment 1: Typosquatting Domains and Email Acceptance
Table 5 presents the results of our first experiment, in which we monitored whether our honey emails were accepted. Out of 1,170 publicly registered domains, 1,170 accepted our emails without any error message. Based on our access logs, three of these domains, including two that appear to be clear typosquatting domains (outfook.com and uutlook.com), seem to have read our emails. However, a large percentage of network errors and timeouts occurred for the majority of publicly registered domains.

Table 6 shows that 95% of the domains which accepted our emails without errors rely on eight mail server domains, all of which are privately registered.

## Experiment 2: Honey Tokens and Honey Accounts
While the pilot measurement—sending data to 738 domains—did not result in any signal being sent back to us, our larger measurement to all 7,269 suspected typosquatting domains resulted in 15 emails being apparently opened and/or read by someone, and two honey tokens being accessed. There was a lag of several hours between the time we sent the emails and the time they were opened or read, suggesting human involvement.

Specifically, on June 16, 2017, a potential typosquatter read the "tax document" we had uploaded to a known document sharing service. The domain we sent this honey email to was once a legitimate service but has been operating as a parked domain for the past two years. Logs provided by the document sharing service indicate that the document was opened half an hour after we sent it and was viewed for 28 seconds from Caracas, Venezuela, using a Windows desktop computer. Nine days later, someone read our email from another IP address also in Caracas, Venezuela, and 14 days later from Orlando, Florida.

Similarly, on June 16, 2017, a potential typosquatter tried to gain access to our honey shell account from an IP in Poland. This specific email did not show up in our logs as having been viewed, presumably because the miscreant did not open inlined images.

While interesting, these two anecdotes are far from providing evidence of systematic email collection and monetization by typosquatters. Given the number of emails we sent, it seems that these practices are the rare exception rather than the norm.

## Discussion and Limitations
A major limitation of this study is that it only considers domain typosquatting and not username typosquatting. For example, aliec@gmail.com might receive a lot of email meant for alice@gmail.com. However, without the collaboration of the email service provider, analyzing username typosquatting is impossible.

Our data collection experiments show that there is potential danger, but, contrary to web typosquatting, the expected risk to consumers is far less obvious. Most of the time, the risk is probably very low, but in a few cases, depending on the specific content being sent, it might lead to disastrous outcomes.

While we have seen only scant evidence of credential abuse in the wild when we posed as victims, we have discovered highly suspicious registration patterns. These may be a by-product of web typosquatting, but we cannot rule out that the situation will not change; the infrastructure appears to be certainly already in place, even though this may be accidental.

### Web vs. Email Typosquatting
Web typosquatting is one of the easiest attacks to carry out, requiring almost no technical knowledge. As our measurements show, some parties are seemingly interested in exploiting typing mistakes and have the ability to collect emails from potential victims. Yet, they don’t appear to act upon these emails, even though there is plenty of evidence that many people could fall victim to this kind of attack.

Reflecting more on this negative result, web typosquatting only needs the ability to register a domain and subscribe to a parking service, making it accessible to any miscreant. On the other hand, email typosquatting requires deeper technical expertise. First, the collection infrastructure is not straightforward to set up. Second, spam filtering is equally complex. To add insult to injury, the payoff is far more uncertain (low occurrence, high payoff) than in the web typosquatting case (high occurrence, low payoff), and the risk of getting in trouble (e.g., if abusing financial credentials) is much higher.

### Possible Defenses
If the situation were to change and typosquatters actually used emails received for profit, our results in Section 4.4 show that far more emails are received by typosquatting domains targeting top email service providers compared to middle-sized providers. This means that large providers registering their typosquatting domains defensively would have the biggest impact per defensive registration and also be the most cost-effective per user. While for a small company, it might be financially burdensome to register hundreds of domains, for major companies, a few thousand dollars a year should be a negligible cost.

Besides defensive domain registrations, typo correction tools could also help reduce the potential harm from typosquatting. Typo correction could be integrated into any input field: at SMTP setup phase, registrations, email recipient, or when giving contact information in online forms.

Policy interventions could also be viable. For instance, the Chinese registry raised the registration price and required identification for .cn domains. Raising the cost of domain registration and requiring identification for registration would definitely drive most typosquatters out of business. However, these interventions would potentially have a high collateral damage on legitimate domain owners. Another approach would be for ICANN and registrars to periodically remove typosquatting domains. This, however, is unlikely to happen due to incentive misalignments, as this would require a great effort from these parties who do not suffer from this activity and whose revenue would decrease.

## Conclusion
We conducted a measurement study of email typosquatting based on our own data collection and an examination of the whole ecosystem. We conclude that the profitability of a typosquatting domain depends on three main factors: popularity of the target domain, edit distance from the target domain, and visual distance from the target domains. We observed that receiver and reflection typo emails are an order of magnitude more frequent than SMTP typo emails. Among the emails received, we found users accidentally sending us emails containing highly sensitive personal data. We also observed that some registrants own thousands of email typosquatting domains, and these domains support SMTP. Furthermore, some of the name servers (and registrars) used by tens of thousands of typosquatting domains appear to be cesspools, with a 5–10 times higher typosquatting domain ratio than normal.

Even though typosquatters have the infrastructure to collect private emails in bulk for pennies each, we found that, with very rare exceptions, they do not actually misuse sensitive information sent to them. We conjecture this may be due to incentives being in favor of web typosquatting—shortly stated, it is not worth bothering with a more complex attack with a more uncertain payoff—but we cannot guarantee the situation will not change. Certainly, the potential for monetization by a determined actor is there, and proactive defenses ought to be considered.
