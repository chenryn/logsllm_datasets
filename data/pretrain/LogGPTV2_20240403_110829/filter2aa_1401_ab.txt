# Chapter 1: About File Services

This chapter provides an overview of Mac OS X Server file services, key concepts, and related security issues.

## Overview
File services enable clients to access shared files, applications, and other resources over a network. Mac OS X Server supports file services based on four common protocols:

- **AFP (Apple Filing Protocol)**: Shares resources with Macintosh or Mac-compatible computers.
- **SMB (Server Message Block)**: Shares resources and provides name resolution for Windows or Windows-compatible computers.
- **FTP (File Transfer Protocol)**: Shares files with users who use FTP client software.
- **NFS (Network File System)**: Shares files and folders with UNIX users who have NFS client software.

### Management Tools
You can manage file services using the following Mac OS X Server applications:
- **Server Admin**: Configure individual file services for each protocol.
- **Workgroup Manager**: Create share points and set access privileges.

Alternatively, you can perform most setup and management tasks via the command line in Terminal. For more information, refer to the file services chapter in the command-line administration guide.

## Privileges
Privileges determine the type of access users have to shared items. There are four types of access privileges:
- **Read & Write**
- **Read Only**
- **Write Only**
- **None**

The table below illustrates how these privileges affect user access to different types of shared items (files, folders, and share points).

| User Action | Read & Write | Read Only | Write Only | None |
|-------------|--------------|-----------|------------|------|
| Open a shared file | Yes | Yes | No | No |
| Copy a shared file | Yes | Yes | No | No |
| Open a shared folder or share point | Yes | Yes | No | No |
| Copy a shared folder or share point | Yes | Yes | No | No |
| Edit a shared file’s contents | Yes | No | No | No |
| Move items into a shared folder or share point | Yes | No | Yes | No |
| Move items out of a shared folder or share point | Yes | No | No | No |

### Explicit Privileges
Share points and their contained items (folders and files) have separate privileges. If an item is moved to a different folder, it retains its own privileges and does not automatically adopt the privileges of the new folder. For example, if the "Designs" and "Documents" folders have different privileges from their parent folders, they will maintain those privileges even when moved.

### User Categories
Access privileges can be assigned to three categories of users:
- **Owner**: The user who creates a new item (file or folder) on the file server. By default, only the owner and the server administrator can change the item's access privileges.
- **Group**: Users who need the same access to files and folders can be grouped together. Only one group can be assigned access privileges to a shared item.
- **Everyone**: Any user who can log in to the file server, including registered users and guests.

### Hierarchy of Privileges
- **Group privileges** override **Everyone privileges**.
- **Owner privileges** override **Group privileges**.

### Client Users and Privileges
- **AppleShare Client users** can set access privileges for files and folders they own.
- **Windows file sharing users** can set folder properties but not privileges.

### Privileges in the Mac OS X Environment
Mac OS X sets many system directories, such as `/Library`, to be owned by the root user. Files and folders owned by root cannot be changed or deleted unless logged in as the root user. New files and folders retain their privileges even when moved, unless explicitly changed by their owners or an administrator.

## Customizing the Mac OS X Network Globe
The Network globe in a Mac OS X Finder window contains shared network resources. You can customize the contents of the Network globe by setting up automatically-mounting share points. This allows you to provide automatic access to system resources such as fonts and preferences.

### Share Points in the Network Globe
By default, the Network globe contains the following folders:
- **Applications**
- **Library**
- **Servers**

You can mount share points into any of these folders. Additional servers and shared items are added as they are discovered on your network.

### Adding System Resources to the Network Library Folder
The Library folder in the Network globe is included in the system search path, allowing you to make system resources available over the network. For example, you can create a share point containing specific fonts and set it to mount automatically in `/Network/Library/Fonts` on client machines.

## Security Considerations
- **Assign appropriate privileges** for each file, folder, and share point.
- **Be cautious** when granting access to Everyone or World (in NFS service), as this could expose your data to anyone on the Internet.
- **Restrict guest access** to protect your information from unauthorized access and potential damage.

# Chapter 2: Setting Up Share Points

This chapter explains how to share specific volumes and directories via the AFP, SMB, FTP, and NFS protocols.

## Overview
Use the Sharing module of Workgroup Manager to share information with clients of the Mac OS X Server and control access to shared information by assigning access privileges.

### Before You Begin
- **Understand Privileges**: Determine which users need access and what type of privileges they should have.
- **Choose Protocols**: Decide which protocols clients will use to access the share points.
- **Organize Information**: Organize shared information before setting up share points.
- **Consider Security**: Review the security considerations discussed in Chapter 1.

### Setup Overview
1. **Read “Before You Begin”**: Understand the considerations before sharing information.
2. **Locate or Create Shared Information**: Decide which volumes, partitions, or folders to share.
3. **Set Up Share Points and Set Privileges**: Use the Sharing module of Workgroup Manager.
4. **Turn On File Services**: Enable the required file services (AFP, SMB, FTP, or NFS).

### Creating a Share Point and Setting Privileges
1. **Open Workgroup Manager** and click **Sharing**.
2. **Select the Item** you want to share.
3. **Click General** and select "Share this item and its contents."
4. **Control Access**: Change the owner or group of the shared item.
5. **Set Privileges**: Use the pop-up menus to change the privileges for the Owner, Group, and Everyone.
6. **Apply Privileges** (Optional): Click **Copy** to apply the ownership and privileges of the share point to all files and folders it contains.

For additional tasks, see "Managing Share Points" on page 30.
