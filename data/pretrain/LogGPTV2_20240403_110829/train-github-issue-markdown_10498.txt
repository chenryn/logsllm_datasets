This works fine:
    function test(): [number, string] {
        return [1, "a"];
    }
But this...
    async function test(): Promise {
        return [1, "a"];
    }
gives the following error:
    main.ts(2,9): error TS2322: Type '(number | string)[]' is not assignable to type '[number, string]'.
      Property '0' is missing in type '(number | string)[]'.
It appears that [1, "a"] has instead been inferred to be an array of number |
string, which is not what I want.
