User: How to monitor server performance and resource utilization at the system level? What are the key indicators to pay attention to?
Assistant: 1. CPU utilization: Indicates the overhead and burden of the CPU. When the CPU utilization exceeds 90%, it may cause server performance degradation. 2. Memory usage: Track server memory usage, which can prevent the server from crashing or slowing down due to insufficient memory. 3. Disk space utilization: When the disk space is insufficient, it will prevent the writing of new files or data, resulting in server crash or data loss. 4. Network bandwidth utilization: Track server network activity and bandwidth utilization to prevent network congestion and insufficient bandwidth. 5. I/O utilization: Whether the processing time of the server is reasonable, and whether I/O reading and writing are effective. 6. Number of connections: The number of concurrent connections supported, it is recommended to set the maximum number of connections to prevent the server from crashing due to this. 7. Operating system log: monitor the operating system log of the server, view warning and error messages, find problems and solve them in time. 8. Security settings: monitor the security settings of the server to prevent hacker attacks and malicious software intrusion, resulting in data leakage or destruction. By monitoring these key indicators, potential server performance problems can be detected and resolved in real time, improving server operating efficiency and stability.
