It seems like you are trying to install the AWS Elastic Beanstalk Command Line Interface (EB CLI) on Ubuntu 14.04, but you're encountering an "eb: command not found" error after extracting the .zip file. Hereâ€™s a more structured and professional way to address this issue:

### Steps to Install the AWS EB CLI on Ubuntu 14.04

1. **Ensure Python and pip are installed:**
   First, make sure that Python and pip are installed on your system. You can check this by running:
   ```sh
   python --version
   pip --version
   ```
   If they are not installed, you can install them using:
   ```sh
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install python-pip
   ```

2. **Upgrade pip:**
   It's a good practice to upgrade pip to the latest version:
   ```sh
   sudo pip install --upgrade pip
   ```

3. **Install the AWS EB CLI:**
   Instead of manually downloading and extracting the .zip file, you can install the EB CLI using pip. Run the following command:
   ```sh
   sudo pip install --upgrade awsebcli
   ```

4. **Verify the Installation:**
   After the installation, verify that the `eb` command is available by running:
   ```sh
   eb --version
   ```

If you still encounter the "eb: command not found" error, it might be due to the `eb` command not being in your system's PATH. You can add it to your PATH by following these steps:

1. **Locate the `eb` executable:**
   Find the location of the `eb` executable. It is usually located in the `bin` directory of the Python environment where it was installed. For example:
   ```sh
   which eb
   ```

2. **Add the `eb` executable to your PATH:**
   If the `eb` executable is not in your PATH, you can add it by modifying your shell configuration file (e.g., `.bashrc` or `.profile`). Add the following line to your configuration file:
   ```sh
   export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/eb
   ```
   Replace `/path/to/eb` with the actual path to the `eb` executable.

3. **Reload the shell configuration:**
   Apply the changes by reloading the shell configuration:
   ```sh
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully install and use the AWS EB CLI on your Ubuntu 14.04 system.
