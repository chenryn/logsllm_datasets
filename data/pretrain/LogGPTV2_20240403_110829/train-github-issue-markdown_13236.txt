I would appreciate the ability to move or snap windows into FancyZones using user-specified shortcuts, such as `Ctrl + Alt + 1` for Zone 1 and `Ctrl + Alt + 2` for Zone 2. This would be in addition to the existing method of dragging a window with the mouse while holding the `Shift` key.

I have found the default Windows key combinations (e.g., `Windows + Arrow` buttons) to be less useful for my workflow. The ability to arrange windows with one hand, rather than requiring both hands, would greatly enhance my productivity.
