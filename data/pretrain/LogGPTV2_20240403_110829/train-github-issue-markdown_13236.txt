I would like to move/snap windows into fancyzones with a user-specified
shorcut like Ctrl + Alt + 1 for zone 1 and Ctrl + Alt + 2 for zone 2 as
addition to existing mouse drag+ shift combination.
I've never find useful windows' default key combination windows + arrow
buttons. I would like to arrange windows with one hand not two.
