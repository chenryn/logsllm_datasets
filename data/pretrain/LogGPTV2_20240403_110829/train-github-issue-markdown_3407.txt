Recently, I stumbled upon this article about validating emails:

We know that validating emails is a complex topic and depending on a lot of
factors, people want something stricter than just checking for `@` or
something simpler than an email being "right".
Lots of issues have being creating along the years here about this issue (I
wanted to list them all here for reference, but there are just too many of
them :)).
What's interesting I think (and I don't remember it being mentioned before but
I might be wrong), is how HTML5 actually validates emails:

Would it be a good middle ground that we could offer as a third alternative to
our users?
