User: I have created a job in Jenkins, for which user provides the value of a specific parameter, let's say PYTHON_PARM, as an input. On this job I execute a python script (using Python Plugin). The problem is that I want to use as a variable the user input $PYTHON_PARM parameter. This is not considered as an environment variable, so when trying to use os.environ['PYTHON_PARM'], this doesn't work.
Any idea?
Thanks,
Assistant: Solution:
from os import environ
Type = environ['Type']
