real device or a virtual node. We set a threshold δ such that
the adversary will be isolated at her access to the device δ + 1.
In other words, the adversary can only access at most δ real
devices before it is isolated from control networks.
adversary is isolated at her k-th access is Qk = pk×(cid:81)k−1
We model the protocol as a series of biased coin ﬂips with
increasing probabilities, i.e., p0, . . . , pk. The probability that an
j=0 (1−
pj) for 1 ≤ k ≤ δ.

Theorem 1. The chance that an adversary will be isolated
from control networks is evenly distributed, i.e., p0 = Q0 =
Q1 = ··· = Qδ, if pk =
p0
1 − k · p0
Proof: We prove this theorem by mathematical induction.
By deﬁnition, when k = 0, we have p0 =
Q0 = p0.
p0
1 − 0 · p0
and
p0
Assuming that, this condition holds when k = i, i.e., if
, we have Qi = p0. When k = i + 1, we
j=0(1 − pj). Through the following
derivation, we can represent Qi+1 in terms of Qi:
