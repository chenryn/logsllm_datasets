### Description
I have two Dockerized FastAPI applications: `App1` and `App2`. `App1` frequently needs to call `App2`. 

Is there a way to route calls from `App1` to `App2` in a simple and efficient manner, without duplicating the endpoints in `App1` and using the `requests` library to call `App2`'s endpoints? 

Ideally, I'm looking for a solution similar to sub-applications, but one that works across two separate Dockerized applications.
