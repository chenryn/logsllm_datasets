### Description
For instance, I have two dockerized FastApi application running. My `App1`
always calls `App2`.  
Is it possible to route calls to `App2` in a simple way from `App1`, without
writing duplicate endpoints in `App1` and using requests lib to call endpoints
in `App2`?
Something in lines of Sub Applications but across two different dockerized
application.
