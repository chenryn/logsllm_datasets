extra restriction) are in Table 4. In total, we identiﬁed 95,547
round-trip transactions according to our regular heuristic, and
identiﬁed 10,490 transactions where the input and output ad-
dresses were the same. Across different currencies, however,
there was a high level of variance in the results. While this
could be a result of the different levels of accuracy in Phase 1
for different currencies, the more likely explanation is that
users indeed engage in different patterns of behavior with
different currencies. For Bitcoin, for example, there was a
very small percentage (1.2%) of round-trip transactions that
used the same address. This suggests that either users are
aware of the general lack of anonymity in the basic Bitcoin
protocol and use ShapeShift to make anonymous payments, or
that if they do use round-trip transactions as a form of money

laundering they are at least careful enough to change their
addresses. More simply, it may just be the case that generating
new addresses is more of a default in Bitcoin than it is in other
currencies.
In other currencies, however, such as Dash, Ethereum Clas-
sic, Litecoin, and Zcash, there were relatively high percent-
ages of round-trip transactions that used the same input and
output address: 72%, 56%, 40%, and 36% respectively. In
Ethereum Classic, this may be explained by the account-based
nature of the currency, which means that it is common for
one entity to use only one address, although the percentage
for Ethereum is much lower (9%). In Dash and Zcash, as
we have already seen in Section 6.2 and explore further in
Section 8.4, it may simply be the case that users assume they
achieve anonymity just through the use of a privacy coin, so
do not take extra measures to hide their identity.
7 Clustering Analysis
7.1 Shared ownership heuristic
As described in Sections 4.1 and 4.2, we engaged in transac-
tions with both ShapeShift and Changelly, which provided
us with some ground-truth evidence of addresses that were
owned by them. We also collected three sets of tagging data
(i.e., tags associated with addresses that describe their real-
world owner): for Bitcoin we used the data available from
WalletExplorer,8 which covers a wide variety of different
Bitcoin-based services; for Zcash we used hand-collected
data from Kappos et al. [6], which covers only exchanges;
and for Ethereum we used the data available from Etherscan,9
which covers a variety of services and contracts.
In order to understand the behavior of these trading plat-
forms and the interaction they had with other blockchain-
based services such as exchanges, our ﬁrst instinct was to
combine these tags with the now-standard “multi-input” clus-

tering heuristic for cryptocurrencies [11, 17], which states
that in a transaction with multiple input addresses, all inputs
belong to the same entity. When we applied this clustering
heuristic to an earlier version of our dataset [23], however,
the results were fairly uneven. For Dogecoin, for example,
the three ShapeShift transactions we performed revealed only
three addresses, which each had done a very small number of
transactions. The three Changelly transactions we performed,
in contrast, revealed 24,893 addresses, which in total had re-
ceived over 67 trillion DOGE. These results suggest that the
trading platforms operate a number of different clusters in
each cryptocurrency, and perhaps even change their behavior
depending on the currency, which in turns makes it clear that
we did not capture a comprehensive view of the activity of
either.
More worrying, in one of our Changelly transactions, we
received coins from a Ethereum address that had been tagged
as belonging to HitBTC, a prominent exchange. This suggests
that Changelly may occasionally operate using exchange ac-
counts, which would completely invalidate the results of the
clustering heuristic, as their individually operated addresses
would end up in the same cluster as all of the ones operated
by HitBTC. We thus decided not to use this type of clustering,
and to instead focus on a new clustering heuristic geared at
identifying common social relationships.
7.2 Common relationship heuristic
As it was clear that the multi-input heuristic would not yield
meaningful information about shared ownership, we chose
to switch our focus away from the interactions ShapeShift
had on the blockchain and look instead at the relationships
between individual ShapeShift users. In particular, we deﬁned
the following heuristic:
Heuristic 7.1. If two or more addresses send coins to the
same address in the curOut blockchain, or if two or more
addresses receive coins from the same address in the curIn
blockchain, then these addresses have some common social
relationship.
The deﬁnition of a common social relationship is (inten-
tionally) vague, and the implications of this heuristic are in-
deed less clear-cut than those of heuristics around shared
ownership. Nevertheless, we consider what it means for two
different addresses, in potentially two different blockchains,
to have sent coins to the same address; we refer to these ad-
dresses as belonging in the input cluster of the output address
(and analogously refer to the output cluster for an address
sending to multiple other addresses). In the case in which the
addresses are most closely linked, it could represent the same
user consolidating money held across different currencies into
a single one. It could also represent different users interacting
with a common service, such as an exchange. Finally, it could
simply be two users who do not know each other directly but
happen to be sending money to the same individual. What can-
not be the case, however, is that the addresses are not related
in any way.
To implement this heuristic, we parsed transactions into
a graph where we deﬁned a node as an address and a di-
rected edge (u,v) as existing when one address u initiated a
ShapeShift transaction sending coins to v, which we identiﬁed
using the results of our pass-through analysis from Section 5.
(This means that the inputs in our graph are restricted to those
for which we ran Phase 1 to ﬁnd the address, and thus that our
input clusters contain only the top 8 currencies. In the other
direction, however, we obtain the address directly from the
API, which means output clusters can contain all currencies.)
Edges are further weighted by the number of transactions sent
from u to v. For each node, the cluster centered on that ad-
dress was then deﬁned as all nodes adjacent to it (i.e., pointing
towards it).
Performing this clustering generated a graph with
2,895,445 nodes (distinct addresses) and 2,244,459 edges.
Sorting the clusters by in-degree reveals the entities that re-
ceived the highest number of ShapeShift transactions (from
the top 8 currencies, per our caveat above). The largest cluster
had 12,868 addresses — many of them belonging to Ethereum,
Litecoin, and Dash — and was centered on a Bitcoin address
belonging to CoinPayments.net, a multi-coin payment pro-
cessing gateway. Of the ten largest clusters, three others
(one associated with Ripple and two with Bitcoin addresses)
are also connected with CoinPayments, which suggests that
ShapeShift is a popular platform amongst its users.
Sorting the individual clusters by out-degree reveals instead
the users who initiated the highest number of ShapeShift trans-
actions. Here the largest cluster (consisting of 2314 addresses)
was centered on a Litecoin address, and the second largest
cluster was centered on an Ethereum address that belonged
to Binance (a popular exchange). Of the ten largest clusters,
two others were centered on Binance-tagged addresses, and
three were centered on other exchanges (Freewallet, Gemini,
and Bittrex). While it makes sense that exchanges typically
dominate on-chain activity in many cryptocurrencies, it is
somewhat surprising to also observe that dominance here,
given that these exchanges already allow users to shift be-
tween many different cryptocurrencies. Aside from the poten-
tial for better rates or the perception of increased anonymity, it
is thus unclear why a user wanting to shift from one currency
to another would do so using ShapeShift as opposed to using
the same service with which they have already stored their
coins.
Beyond these basic statistics, we apply this heuristic to sev-
eral of the case studies we investigate in the next section. We
also revisit here the large spike in the number of U-turns that
we observed in Section 6.2. Our hypothesis then was that this
spike was caused by a small number of parties, due to the sim-
ilar USD value carried by the transactions and by the re-use of
a small number of addresses across Dash, Ethereum, and Lite-

coin. Here we brieﬂy investigate this further by examining
the clusters centered on these addresses.
Of the 13 Dash addresses, all but one of them formed small
input and output clusters that were comprised of addresses
solely from Litecoin and Ethereum. Of the 9 Litecoin ad-
dresses, 6 had input clusters consisting solely of Dash and
Ethereum addresses, with two of them consisting solely of
Dash addresses. Finally, of the 4 Ethereum addresses, all of
them had input clusters consisting solely of Dash and Lite-
coin addresses. One of them, however, had a diverse set of
addresses in its output cluster, belonging to Bitcoin, Bitcoin
Cash, and a number of Ethereum-based tokens. These results
thus still suggest a small number of parties, due to the tight
connection between the three currencies in the clusters, al-
though of course further investigation would be needed to get
a more complete picture.
8 Patterns of ShapeShift Usage
In this section, we examine potential applications of the anal-
ysis developed in previous sections, in terms of identifying
speciﬁc usages of ShapeShift. As before, our focus is on
anonymity, and the potential that such platforms may offer
for money laundering or other illicit purposes, as well as for
trading. To this end, we begin by looking at two case studies
associated with explicitly criminal activity and examine the
interactions these criminals had with the ShapeShift platform.
We then switch in Section 8.3 to look at non-criminal activity,
by attempting to identify trading bots that use ShapeShift and
the patterns they may create. Finally, in Section 8.4 we look at
the role that privacy coins (Monero, Zcash, and Dash) play, in
order to identify the extent to which the usage of these coins
in ShapeShift is motivated by a desire for anonymity.
8.1 Starscape Capital
In January 2018, an investment ﬁrm called Starscape Capital
raised over 2,000 ETH (worth 2.2M USD at the time) during
their Initial Coin Offering, after promising users a 50% return
in exchange for investing in their cryptocurrency arbitrage
fund. Shortly afterwards, all of their social media accounts
disappeared, and it was reported that an amount of ETH worth
517,000 USD was sent from their wallet to ShapeShift, where
it was shifted into Monero [20].
We conﬁrmed this for ourselves by observing that the ad-
dress known to be owned by Starscape Capital participated in
192 Ethereum transactions across a three-day span (January
19-21), during which it received and sent 2,038 ETH; in total
it sent money in 133 transactions. We found that 109 of these
transactions sent money to ShapeShift, and of these 103 were
shifts to Monero conducted on January 21 (the remaining 6
were shifts to Ethereum). The total amount shifted into Mon-
ero was 465.61 ETH (1388.39 XMR), and all of the money
was shifted into only three different Monero addresses, of
which one received 70% of the resulting XMR. Using the
clusters deﬁned in Section 7.2, we did not ﬁnd evidence of
any other addresses (in any other currencies) interacting with
either the ETH or XMR addresses associated with Starscape
Capital.
8.2 Ethereum-based scams
EtherScamDB10 is a website that, based on user reports that
are manually investigated by its operators, collects and lists
Ethereum addresses that have been involved in scams. As
of January 30 2019, they had a total of 6374 scams listed,
with 1973 associated addresses. We found that 194 of these
addresses (9% of those listed) had been involved in 853 trans-
actions to ShapeShift, of which 688 had a status ﬁeld of
complete. Across these successful transactions, 1797 ETH
was shifted to other currencies: 74% to Bitcoin, 19% to Mon-
ero, 3% to Bitcoin Cash, and 1% to Zcash.
The scams which successfully shifted the highest volumes
belonged to so-called trust-trading and MyEtherWallet scams.
Trust-trading is a scam based on the premise that users who
send coins prove the legitimacy of their addresses, after which
the traders “trust” their address and send back higher amounts
(whereas in fact most users send money and simply receive
nothing in return). This type of scam shifted over 918 ETH,
the majority of which was converted to Bitcoin (691 ETH,
or 75%). A MyEtherWallet scam is a phishing/typosquatting
scam where scammers operate a service with a similar name
to the popular online wallet MyEtherWallet,11 in order to trick
users into giving them their account details. These scammers
shifted the majority of the stolen ETH to Bitcoin (207 ETH)
and to Monero (151 ETH).
Given that the majority of the overall stolen coins was
shifted to Bitcoin, we next investigated whether or not these
stolen coins could be tracked further using our analysis. In
particular, we looked to see if they performed a U-turn or a
round-trip transaction, as discussed in Section 6. We identiﬁed
one address, associated with a trust-trading scam, that partici-
pated in 34 distinct round-trip transactions, all coming back
to a different address from the original one. All these trans-
actions used Bitcoin as curOut and used the same address
in Bitcoin to both receive and send coins; i.e., we identiﬁed
the U-turns in Bitcoin according to our address-based heuris-
tic. In total, more than 70 ETH were circulated across these
round-trip transactions.
8.3 Trading bots
ShapeShift, like any other cryptocurrency exchange, can be
used by traders who wish to take advantage of the volatility
in cryptocurrency prices. The potential advantages of doing
this via ShapeShift, as compared with other platforms that

focus more on the exchange between cryptocurrencies and
ﬁat currencies, are that (1) ShapeShift transactions can be
easily automated via their API, and (2) a single ShapeShift
transaction acts to both purchase desired coins and dump
unwanted ones. Such trading usually requires large volumes
of transactions and high precision on their the timing, due
to the constant ﬂuctuation in cryptocurrency prices. We thus
looked for activity that involved large numbers of similar
