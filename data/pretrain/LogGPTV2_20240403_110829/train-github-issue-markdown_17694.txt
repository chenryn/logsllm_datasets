## Expected Behavior
When a textfield is focused, only that and the one that got blurred (if any)
should be repainted
## Current Behavior
When a textfield is focused, all following textfields on that page is
repainted
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
  1. Have a page with multiple textfields, for example https://material-ui.com/demos/text-fields/
  2. Use dev tools to see which parts of the page is repainted. For example Chromes "paint flashing" or "layer boarders"
  3. Focus a textfield
## Context
This is not a huge problem but it does add some extra cost and I have noticed
a bit of slowdowns on a phone which would be nice to crush.  
I have not tested but my theory is that the line  
https://github.com/mui-org/material-
ui/blob/e49ce4f7c2df242062fe46a2f3aeb30f78a01ef1/src/Input/Input.js#L453
should be covered by an if-statement to only set state (and therefor rerender)
if `focused` is already `false`
