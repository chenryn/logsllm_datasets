User: I have .sh script that executes .py script and it doesn't work giving me following error:
C:\Python27\python.exe: can't open file '/cygdrive/c/NewFolder/Kindle/Src_Updater/kindle_update_tool_lite.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory
How can I combine cygwin style path (/cygdrive/) and windows version of Python without changing scripts?
Assistant: You should use the python interpreter from inside cygwin POSIX environment.
