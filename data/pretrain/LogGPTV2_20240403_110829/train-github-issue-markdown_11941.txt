The responsive utility class .visible-* assumes that we always want
display:block to reenable displaying of the given element. It would be nice if
in the case that we used this class on an inline element it produced a
display:inline style.
Adjustments are offered in the case that the tag is table related, but not a
span (which really should be inline). Perhaps other inline elements could be
considered also? https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTML/Inline_elements
A span rule could be added to the .responsive-visibility() mixin in
mixins.less
.responsive-visibility() {  
display: block !important;  
table& { display: table; }  
tr& { display: table-row !important; }  
th&,  
td& { display: table-cell !important; }  
span& { display: inline !important; }  
}
