User: I have configured a keyboard shortcut using xbindkeys to run a python script.
Now, while editing any vim file if that user press that keyboard shortcut-

I want my python script to run this command to paste the path and line no to the system clipboard-
:let @+=expand("%") . ':' . line(".")
Then I want my script to copy that path from the system clipboard and process it further

Can you please suggest me a good solution for this.
Thanks In advance
Assistant: You should be using Vim's Python API, not an external Python script. see :h python. You can access all that info directly through its functions. You can evaluate a vim command with vim.command() to interface with the clipboard.
There are other ways to get at the clipboard using e.g. PyGTK, or perhaps more directly through python-xlib, but would probably be more difficult.
