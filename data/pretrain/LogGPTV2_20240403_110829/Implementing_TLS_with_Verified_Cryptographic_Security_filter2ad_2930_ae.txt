### Stateful Length-hiding Authenticated Encryption (StAE) and Handshake Protocol

#### StAE: Stateful Length-hiding Authenticated Encryption

**Overview:**
- **StAE** is built on top of **LHAE** (Length-hiding Authenticated Encryption) and extends it to authenticate the position of each plaintext within a stream of messages.
- It introduces a fourth index, a log, which records the sequence of preceding plaintexts and additional data.

**Types and Interfaces:**

1. **Type Definition:**
   ```ocaml
   type stplain = (id:index, l:log, ad:data, r:range) -> stplain
   ```

2. **Ideal Interface for StAE:**
   - **Key Generation:**
     ```ocaml
     val GEN: id:index -> w:writer {Log(w) = []} * r:reader {Log(r) = []}
     ```
   - **Encryption:**
     ```ocaml
     val ENC: id:index -> wr:writer -> d:data -> r:range -> p:stplain -> c:cipher * wr':writer
     {Log(wr') = (d, p)::Log(wr) ∧ ENCrypted(id, wr, d, p, c) ∧ CipherRange(id, r, c)}
     ```
   - **Decryption:**
     ```ocaml
     val DEC: id:index -> rd:reader -> d:data -> c:cipher -> o:(range * stplain * reader) option
     {Auth(id) ⇒ (!rd', r, p. o = Some(rd', r, p) ⇔ (∃wr. ENCrypted(id, wr, d, p, c) ∧ Log(wr) = Log(rd)))}
     ```

**Properties:**
- **CipherRange(id, r, c):** A predicate asserting that the length of ciphertext `c` reveals at most that the length of the plaintext is in the range `r`.
- **ENCrypted(id, d, p, c):** An abstract predicate stating that `c` is an authenticated encryption of `p` with additional data `d`.

**Security:**
- **Authenticity and Confidentiality:** Follow from parametricity for values of the `stplain` type when the predicates `Auth(id)` and `Safe(id)` hold.
- **Implementation Security:** Supports many protocol versions and ciphersuites, but provides security only for strong indexes using TLS 1.2 with secure ciphersuites (e.g., AES_CBC with fresh IVs).

**Formal Development:**
- Mirrors Krawczyk's result [39, Theorem 2] on IND-CPA security and combined INT-CTXT security.
- Uses Paterson et al.'s [50] result to show that block-cipher-based schemes are combined INT-CTXT secure.

**Concrete Implementation:**
- **Sequence of Modules:**
  ```ocaml
  C = MAC · Encode · ENC · LHAE
  ```
- **Security Proof:**
  - Proven by typing that `C` is LHAE-secure for IND-CPA secure modules `ENC` and for restricted users (using LHAE keys linearly with pairwise-distinct additional data).

**Theorem 3:**
- If `C` is `Ii_LHAE-secure` for restricted users, then `S` (which includes `LHAEPlain` and `StAE`) is `Ii_StPlain; Ii_StAE-secure` for restricted users.

#### Handshake Protocol

**Overview:**
- Manages sessions and connections, delegating tasks to a component that hides the Handshake protocol from the rest of the code.
- Verified against a typed interface `Ii_HS` that specifies key-establishment and session management.

**Data Structures:**

1. **Role:**
   ```ocaml
   type Role = Client | Server
   ```

2. **ConnectionInfo:**
   ```ocaml
   type ConnectionInfo = {
     role: Role;
     id_rand: random;
     id_in: epoch;
     id_out: epoch
   }
   ```

3. **Epoch:**
   ```ocaml
   type epoch =
     | Init of Role
     | Next of random * random
   ```

4. **SessionInfo:**
   ```ocaml
   type SessionInfo = {
     init_crand: random;
     init_srand: random;
     version: version;
     cipherSuite: cipherSuite;
     compression: compression;
     pms_data: bytes;
     clientID: cert list;
     serverID: cert list;
     sessionID: sessionID
   }
   ```

**Control Interface:**
- Functions to create new instances of the protocol, as client or server, possibly resuming existing sessions, and to initiate re-handshakes on established connections.
- Events and predicates to track configuration, progress, and completion of handshakes.

**Network Interface:**
- Handshake progresses by sending and receiving fragments of content types `Handshake` and `CCS`.
- Updates internal state and notifies progress gradually, confirming handshake completion and enabling the use of new keys for application data.

**Security:**
- **Predicate SafeHS(si):** Indicates secure runs of the handshake, ensuring that the negotiated content is compatible with initial configurations and that the handshake was secure.
- **Definition 5:** A module `HS` is a secure handshake if it is `Ii_HS-secure` for restricted users.
- **Strong Cryptographic Assumptions:** Ensures the security of the pre-master secret exchange using RSA-PMS and DH-PMS.

This structured and detailed explanation ensures clarity, coherence, and professionalism in the presentation of the StAE and Handshake protocols.
