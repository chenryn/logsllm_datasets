# Hello World
Misc, 339 points
## Description:
> My first program!
The source code of a cpp file was attached.
## Solution:
Upon first inspection, the source code seems very innocent:
```c++
#include 
using namespace std;
int main()
{
	cout 
using\snamespace\sstd;
int\smain()
{
\tcout\s>> "".join(chr(x) for x in [103, 105, 103, 101, 109, 123, 48, 104, 95, 109, 121, 95, 119, 104, 52, 116, 95, 115, 112, 52, 99, 49, 110, 103, 95, 121, 48, 117, 95, 104, 52, 118, 51, 125])
'gigem{0h_my_wh4t_sp4c1ng_y0u_h4v3}'
```
