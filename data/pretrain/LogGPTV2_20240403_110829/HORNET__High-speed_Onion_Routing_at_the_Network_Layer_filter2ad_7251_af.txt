### 5.5 Trade-Offs and Enhancements

Autonomous Systems (ASes) can allow paths that deviate from the valley-freeness policy to increase the anonymity set size of end hosts. This approach enables a trade-off between path length and anonymity, as described by Sankey and Wright [44].

Additionally, upper-layer anonymity protocols can be used in conjunction with HORNET to provide stronger anonymity guarantees. For example, to entirely remove the concerns of topology-based attacks, a single-hop proxy or virtual private network (VPN) could be employed to increase the size of the anonymity sets of end hosts. Similar solutions can also protect against upper-layer de-anonymization attacks, particularly fingerprinting attacks on the transport protocol [46].

At lower layers, HORNET is compatible with link-layer protection such as link-level encryption. The role of link-level encryption in HORNET is similar to SSL/TLS in Tor. Link encryption prevents an adversary eavesdropping on a link from being able to distinguish individual sessions, thereby making confirmation attacks much more difficult for this type of adversary.

### 7.3 Limitations

#### Targeted Confirmation Attacks

When an adversary controls both the node closest to the source and the node closest to the destination (or the destination itself) for a specific session, they can launch confirmation attacks by analyzing flow dynamics. These attacks can be made more effective by replaying packets.

HORNET, like other low-latency onion routing schemes [25], cannot prevent such confirmation attacks targeting a small number of specific users [45, 33]. However, HORNET raises the bar for deploying such attacks at scale: the adversary must control a significant percentage of ISPs, often residing in multiple geopolitical areas. Additionally, the packet obfuscation measures built into HORNET (discussed in Section 5) make it non-trivial to link two flows, as it is not possible to simply match packets through bit patterns. Timing intervals for packet sequences need to be stored and compared, making such operations expensive for a large fraction of observed flows. Furthermore, it is challenging for attackers to perform active attacks (e.g., packet replay) at scale while remaining undetected. For instance, a downstream benign AS can detect replayed packets by a compromised upstream AS; end hosts can also detect and report packet tagging attacks when a threshold number of end-to-end MACs do not successfully verify.

#### Perfect Forward Secrecy

A drawback of HORNET’s efficiency-driven design is that it does not provide perfect forward secrecy for the link between communicating parties. This means that an adversary could record the observed traffic (the setup phases, in particular), and if it later compromises a node, it learns which node was next on the path for each recorded session. This is an unavoidable limitation of having a setup that consists of a single round-trip.

Other systems, such as Tor, use a telescopic setup, which achieves perfect forward secrecy at the cost of diminished performance (higher latency and additional asymmetric cryptographic operations per node). Using a telescopic setup is also possible for HORNET, but it would come with the performance cost and require all paths to be reversible. However, this requirement does not hold in today’s Internet, where a significant fraction of AS-level paths are asymmetric [31].

It is important to note that in HORNET, it is still possible to achieve perfect forward secrecy for the contents of the communication, i.e., for the data exchanged between sources and destinations. The destination needs to generate an ephemeral Diffie-Hellman key pair and derive an additional shared key from it. Destinations also need to frequently generate a new local secret SV, so in the event of a destination being compromised, it is not possible for the adversary to decrypt FSes used in expired sessions.

### 8. Related Work

#### Anonymity Systems as Overlays

The study of anonymous communication began with Chaum’s proposal for mix networks [18]. Since then, several message-based mix systems have been proposed and deployed [30, 38, 21, 22]. These systems can withstand active adversaries and a large fraction of compromised relays but rely on expensive asymmetric primitives and message batching and mixing, leading to high computational overhead and latency.

Onion routing systems [43, 14, 15, 25] were proposed to efficiently support interactive traffic. Generally, low-latency onion routing systems are vulnerable to end-to-end confirmation attacks [34] and may fail to provide relationship anonymity when two routers on the path are compromised [29, 33]. HORNET shares these limitations.

Tor, a specific onion routing system, has several security advantages over HORNET. Tor can prevent replays and provides perfect forward secrecy for its sessions. Additionally, due to its overlay design using global redirection, Tor is not constrained by the underlying network topology. However, global redirection enables attack vectors that allow even single compromised ASes to perform confirmation attacks [40, 13], as one AS can be traversed multiple times. This attack is not possible in HORNET since packets traverse each AS on the path only once.

HORNET’s performance also distinguishes it from existing schemes based on overlay networks:
1. HORNET can directly use short paths provided by underlying network architectures, reducing propagation latency.
2. HORNET requires only a single round trip to establish a session, reducing setup delay.
3. HORNET eliminates processing and queuing delays both on relay nodes and in the kernel’s network stack.
4. Edge routers in HORNET offer higher throughput compared to voluntarily-contributed end hosts, increasing the total throughput of anonymous traffic.

#### Anonymity Systems in Future Internet Architectures (FIAs)

Hsiao et al. [32] explored the design space of efficient anonymous systems with a relaxed adversary model. In their scheme, LAP, the adversary can compromise only a single node, and the first hop must always be honest. Sankey and Wright proposed Dovetail [44] (based on Pathlets [28] and SCION [51, 12]), which has the same attacker model as LAP, except it allows the first hop to be compromised. Neither LAP nor Dovetail can support asymmetric paths where packets traverse different sets of nodes in different directions.

HORNET offers three improvements over LAP and Dovetail:
1. HORNET fully hides path information, i.e., total path length and nodes’ positions, in packet headers.
2. HORNET protects and obfuscates packet contents by onion-encryption/decryption, thwarting correlating packets of the same flow by selectors.
3. HORNET supports asymmetric paths and allows the first hop ASes to be compromised.

Although HORNET introduces additional overhead compared to LAP and Dovetail, our evaluation results show that HORNET can still support high-speed packet forwarding at nearly 80% of line rate.

The research community has also explored applying onion routing to FIAs. Liu et al. [35] proposed Tor instead of IP as an FIA that regards anonymity as the principal requirement for the network architecture. However, details on how to scale Tor’s current design (requiring per-circuit state) to Internet scale were not addressed. DiBenedetto et al. [24] proposed ANDaNA, to enable onion routing in Named Data Networking (NDN) [50]. NDN focuses on content delivery and is inherently different from the FIAs we considered.

### 9. Conclusion

In this paper, we address the question of “what minimal mechanism can we use to frustrate pervasive surveillance?” and study the design of a high-speed anonymity system supported by the network architecture. We propose HORNET, a scalable and high-speed onion routing scheme for future Internet architectures. HORNET nodes can process anonymous traffic at over 93 Gb/s and require no per-flow state, paving the way for Internet-scale anonymity. Our experiments show that small trade-offs in packet header size greatly benefit security while retaining high performance.
