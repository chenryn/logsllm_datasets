User: when I try to install the pyodbc by using "python setup.py build install", it shows up with some errors like the following:
gcc -pthread -fno-strict-aliasing -DNDEBUG -march=i586 -mtune=i686 -fmessage-length=0 -O2 -Wall -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 -fstack-protector -funwind-tables -fasynchronous-unwind-tables -g -fwrapv -fPIC -DPYODBC_VERSION=3.0.3 -I/usr/include/python2.6 -c /root/Desktop/pyodbc-3.0.3/src/sqlwchar.cpp -o build/temp.linux-i686-2.6/root/Desktop/pyodbc-3.0.3/src/sqlwchar.o -Wno-write-strings

and few more lines with similar feedback, in the end of the reply is like:

error: command 'gcc' failed with exit status 1
and I have searched around for the solutions, everyone says to install python-devel and it will be fine, but I got this working on a 64bit opensuse without the python-devel,but it doesn't work on the 32bit one, and I couldn't found the right version for python2.6.0-8.12.2 anywhere on the internet... so I'm quite confused, please help! thanks in advance.
Assistant: I don't see a way around having the Python header files (which are part of python-devel package). They are required to compile the package.
Maybe there was a pre-compiled egg for the 64bit version somewhere, and this is how it got installed.
Why are you reluctant to install python-devel?
