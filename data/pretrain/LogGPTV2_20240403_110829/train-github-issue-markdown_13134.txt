# Feature request
## Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
url structures are still visible on devices, so its a UI-element and often is
bound to editorial decisions, yet in nextjs, url routes always reflect the
filesystem of the project
Having the filename of a page be the route path segment might be ok, if you
develop for an english target group, but leads to problems in other markets.
E.g. in switzerland we often need to have an app in multiple languages and
customers often wish that the url paths are also translated.
Also, there is a common practice, that source code is always in english. So
this leads to the problem, that when you decide to have e.g. german url paths,
you need to have german-named files in your app, which just feels wrong.
Nextjs should therefore provide a firstclass support to translate url path
segments.
## Describe the solution you'd like
There should be a way to provide aliases to pages in code. So a page would be
delivered on all available aliases. It should be possible to use translation
services to provide these aliases. They should work both on server and on
client.
If you use a `` to a page, you can provide some context, so that
nextjs would use the right alias to make the route. E.g. you could provide the
locale.
I don't know nextjs good enough to suggest an api for it yet, but suggestions
are very welcome!
## Describe alternatives you've considered
Doing it with dynamic routes (next 9 feature), is nearly impossible, because
every page and folder would basically look like `[slug].js`, so you would need
to deliver the right page yourself, defeating the purpose of the whole file-
system-routing.
It's only possible with a custom server and some boilerplate, so that your
`` behave correctly. But this is needs careful setup, so that you
don't have duplicated route declarations and it is therefore error-prone.
