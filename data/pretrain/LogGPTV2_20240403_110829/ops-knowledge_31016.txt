User: 请选择LogParser领域相关问题的正确答案及解释Here are some common logs
 0 00:01:03 Info Session: 11152_142416105 initialized by client SPP.
 1 04:30:31 Info SQM: Failed to start standard sample upload. [HRESULT = 0x80004005 - E_FAIL]
 2 00:00:46 Info SQM: Failed to start standard sample upload. [HRESULT = 0x80004005 - E_FAIL]
The first three parts of the log are index, timestamp, and log level. Without considering these three parts, Here we assume that the variables in the logs are represented as '<*>', separated by spaces between tokens. What is the specific log template for the above logs?

A: TrustedInstaller service starts successfully. 和 SQM: Initializing online with Windows opt-in: False
B: Loaded Servicing Stack <*> with Core: <*>\cbscore.dll 和 <*>@<*>/<*>/<*>:<*>:<*>:<*>.<*> WcpInitialize (wcp.dll version <*>) called (stack @<*>)
C: <*>@<*>/<*>/<*>:<*>:<*>:<*>.<*> WcpInitialize (wcp.dll version <*>) called (stack @<*>) 和 SQM: Initializing online with Windows opt-in: False
D: SQM: Failed to start standard sample upload. [HRESULT = <*> - E_FAIL] 和 Session: <*>_<*> initialized by client SPP.
