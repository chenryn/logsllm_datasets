for word embedding. Speciﬁcally,
word2vec [23] model
we trained the model with Chinese Wikipedia corpora [22]
and set skip-gram to be the language model, with hidden layer
size = 200, window size = 10, minimal word occurrence =
10, and other default settings. The sentence embedding model
[29] we used is built on top of the word embedding technique,
using an improved random walk model for generating text,
with the probability for each word calculated from the
Wikipedia corpus and the scalar α = 1e-3.
• Topic word selection. Given the z-score ranking of words,
we illustrated the top 20 in Figure 13 of Appendix. The
ﬁgure displays higher z-score words in larger fonts. Those
automatically identiﬁed words turn out to be quite relevant
to the conversation with a given criminal role.
• Stream classiﬁer. We implemented the stream classiﬁers with
LIBSVM [31]. The classiﬁers were trained with the following
settings: c=4.0, g=0.03125 and other default settings. We used
log-transformation on feature values to smooth the variance
and scaled all features in range of (0,10), under which our
model reported the best performance.
• Role Identiﬁer threshold. We identiﬁed the role of an
upstream actor using a threshold of verb-and-noun phrases
ratio. We set it as 0.8, which is decided by 10 experiments
with the setting from 0.6 to 1.5 (0.1 increment in each step)
and achieves the best performance on the training set.
• Similarity threshold. The threshold th for similarity compari-

training and the rest for testing, and we oversampled positive
samples to make the dataset balanced. Given the aforemen-
tioned dataset, we evaluated performance on the test set for the
upstream classiﬁer, downstream classiﬁer, upstream actor clas-
siﬁer (see Section III-B) and the overall role identiﬁcation (i.e,
identify the exact role regardless of upstream and downstream).
Our experiment shows the upstream classiﬁer achieve 87.0%
precision with 91.2% recall, and the downstream classiﬁer
shows an 81.1% precision with 95.6% recall. Based upon
the upstream classiﬁcation, the upstream actor identiﬁer (see
Section III-B) further achieves a precision of 89.0% and a
recall of 92.8% when taking SIM farmer as the positive label.
Altogether, Target Finder achieved a micro-F1 score [12]
of 86.2% (i.e., micro-averaging for multi-class evaluation).
Further, we ran Target Finder over the chat logs of
20,265 IM group members. It reported 1,044 SIM farmers, 700
account merchants and 2,648 fraud order operators. Figure 5
shows the number of newly appeared active roles every two
months with the average of 290 per month. The total number of
active roles we observed increase from 707 to 2,064 within 16
months. We observed the peak of active roles number in June
and November due to the shopping carnival events in China.
In our experiment, Aubrey utilized three ordinary QQ user
accounts, each for one type of miscreants. Aubrey attempted
to chat with 545 e-commerce miscreants who were active in
Sept - Oct. 2018, and successfully chatted with 470, in which
458 are indeed the roles identiﬁed (97.4% accuracy, when only
considering the criminals Aubrey chatted with). Particularly,
Aubrey chatted with each subject under the context of a
criminal activity (e.g., fraud account trading) related to its
corresponding role. If the conversation was successful, we
believe that the subject was indeed the role identiﬁed.
Effectiveness of Aubrey. Among the 545 chat attempts,
Aubrey successfully chatted with 470 e-commerce miscreants,
including 185 SIM farmers, 130 account merchants, and 155
fraud order operators. Example chats are shown in Figure 12 of
the Appendix. Note that these 545 miscreants were discovered
from the chat history of the latest two months. We evaluated
Aubrey on them because they are more likely to respond to
Aubrey than those inactive in the IM groups.
There were 75 miscreants that did not respond to Aubrey
at all. Note that it does not necessarily indicate they identiﬁed
Aubrey as a bot. Actually, prior research [33] shows that
even a real human can only achieve a 65.6% response rate,
whereas it was 86% in our study. Among the 470 miscreants
Aubrey chatted with , only one explicitly questioned whether
it was a chatbot (Figure 12(b)). Determining how Aubrey
was identiﬁed is difﬁcult, since the conversation ended in
the ﬁrst FSM state, thus, we did not get much information
from the interactions. One possible reason is the limited
purchase records of Aubrey. However, the miscreants rarely
vet their potential partners based upon reputation since the e-
commerce fraud activities are committed through underground
crowdsourcing. It can be difﬁcult to evaluate the reputation of
a large number of workers.
Figure 6 illustrates the cumulative distribution of the num-
ber of miscreants per interaction round (a question-answer
pair). On average, Aubrey chatted with one SIM farmer,
account merchant and fraud order operator for 6, 7, and 4
interaction rounds, respectively. On average,
took four
minutes for Aubrey to chat with one target. Interestingly, we
observe that account merchants usually have more interactions
with Aubrey. This may be because account trading lies at
the center of the fraud ecosystem, making account merchants
involved in both upstream and downstream illicit businesses
and will have intelligence for both SIM farmers and fraud order
operators. For those miscreants who partially provide artifacts,
they may not have the target intelligence or due to different
business models (e.g., miscreants sell fraud accounts on IM
platform directly instead of on a website, see Figure 12(c)).
it
Figure 7 illustrates the cumulative distribution of the num-
ber of interaction rounds for getting threat artifacts. We observe
that 52% of the artifacts were gathered within three interaction
rounds. It also indicates the effectiveness of our model to
capture threat intelligence from underground miscreants lever-
aging limited communication traces.
V. THREAT INTELLIGENCE ANALYSIS
From the intelligence collected through Aubrey’s conversa-
tions with 470 miscreants, we gain new insights into how they
use one-on-one chat for trading prohibited products, promot-
ing illicit websites, and coordinating underground operations.
Among the 7,250 interaction rounds Aubrey recorded, we
extracted 40 SIM gateways, 38 fraud account marketplaces,
and 65 fraud order afﬁliate networks. Table III elaborates on
the intelligence gleaned from all the miscreants in the three
roles. A large portion of the intelligence comes from SIM
farmers, who are also related to 16 SIM sources and 323K
fraud phone numbers. Also interestingly, compared to the up-
stream actors, downstream fraud order operators tend to share
less intelligence since they usually share much information in
the group chat. Further, our study reveals 62 payment accounts
(e.g., Alipay, WechatPay) of the actors.

SIM farms. From the 40 SIM gateways, we discovered
at
least 323K fraud phone numbers that can be used for
bulk registrations on Company A’s platforms, which has re-
strictions on the acceptable types of phone numbers (e.g.,
non-VoIP numbers). Speciﬁcally,
through the phone num-
ber fetching APIs (e.g., getPhone() in sfoxer.com) provided
by the gateways, we issued bulk GET requests (e.g., GET
api.sfoxer.com/api/do.php?action=getPhone&token=&sid=) to
enumerate fraud phone numbers on the gateways. Figure 8
illustrates the phone number distribution across China, with
the locations associated with more numbers in darker color.
We ﬁnd that most of the numbers stay in Sichuan (33.9%),
Heilongjiang (11.7%), and Jilin (7.3%). Also interestingly, we
observed the rise in the quantity of fraud phone numbers from
Southeast Asian countries like Myanmar and Thailand. An
explanation is that the phone numbers from these countries
are supported by Chinese carriers while SIM card registrations
in those countries usually do not require an owner’s national
ID veriﬁcation. We reported all
those phone numbers to
Company A. By far, 190K of phone numbers were veriﬁed by
Company A, with 90% of them already being used for account
registration and 72% of the registered accounts having already
been used. Further, with the help of this intelligence, Company
A successfully ﬂagged 98% of the accounts to be suspicious.
Fraud accounts. We studied the fraud accounts provided by
some account merchants2 found in our study. As an example,
we worked with Company A to understand the fraud accounts
in the wild. With permission, we bought 150 of Company A’s
accounts in different types (e.g., enterprise account, account
with rewards, etc.) from 17 account merchants. The prices for
those accounts ranged from $0.15 to $0.65, and all the payment
attempts for the purchases went
through successfully. The
accounts we received usually came with username, password
and registered phone number; sometimes with the IPs used for
registrations, emails, and timestamps. Altogether, 126 phone
numbers and 65 IPs were found in addition to the 150 fraud
accounts. After reporting all such intelligence to Company
A, we received feed back that 52.5% of these accounts have
anomalous activities during their registrations while 9.1% of
them have been used. The ﬁndings demonstrate that those
accounts can still bypass the company’s registration detection.
By looking for other accounts also associated with these phone
numbers and IPs, 4,252 more accounts were identiﬁed and
determined to be suspicious by the company. Company A is
improving the current detection system with these ﬁndings.

Fraud orders. In bonus hunting, a large number of orders
should be shipped to hunter’s addresses, which could raise
suspicion. To evade detection from the e-commerce platform,
bonus hunters often generate many truncated addresses with
speciﬁc patterns and collude with the express company ofﬁcers
[7] to deliver the shipments with these patterns to them.
So,
identifying the patterns is crucial for the e-commerce
platform to mitigate the fraud order operations. From the
communication of the downstream operators, we discovered
about 4,000 fake addresses for order shipping from 30,000
bonus hunting jobs. Further we manually summarized their
patterns into eight categories (Table IV). Again, we reported
all the ﬁndings to Company A for further investigation with
law enforcement (see legal discussion in Section VIII).
VI. HIDDEN CRIMINAL INFRASTRUCTURES
In this section, we elaborate on how the intelligence col-
lected from individual conversations enriches our knowledge of
the e-commerce fraud ecosystem, in terms of unprecedented
insights into e-commerce fraudsters’ operations on the deep
web, and the complicated relationships between upstream and
downstream miscreants.
A. E-commerce Supply Chain in Deep Web
Deep websites. Further we analyzed whether the resources
disclosed by the threat intelligence can also be found from the
surface web or at least indexed by some search engines such
as the dark web engines for Tor. For this purpose, we ﬁrst
inspected robot.txt of 40 SIM gateways, 38 account trading and
65 fraud order sites discovered from the chat traces Aubrey
gathered, which indicates that these sites are not allowed to
be indexed by the search engines. Further, we searched these
sites’ domains as keywords on various search engines (Google,
Bing, and dark engines like Torch), and found that 93% of such
keywords do not have any search results, indicating that they
are not disclosed on the indexed sites.
10

phone numbers in China.
Fig. 9: Intel. collection comparison.
Fig. 10: Complicity of roles.
We also observed 35 web hosting platforms in total
from the fraud-dedicated IM groups. For example, 34 fraud
account marketplaces are running on the hosting platform
shop.91kami.com, all of which are built upon the similar
template. Other popular hosting platforms include onini.cn
and ikpay.cn. Interestingly, 25 (71.4%) of them are hosted on
commercial cloud services like Aliyun.
Particularly interesting is the trend that cybercriminals are
moving their illicit sites from the surface web to the deep web:
in October 2017, 62 SIM gateways were on the surface web
(indexed by Google, Bing and Baidu), while only 27 can be
searched in October 2018. Accordingly, the number of deep
web sites has increased from 7 to 32 during the same period.
Attack asset distribution. We found that to hide their business
infrastructures, cybercriminals start to disclose their resources
only in one-on-one conversations. As an example, from chat-
ting with 130 fraud account merchants, Aubrey helped us
obtain ﬁve bonus hunting software from them, three of which
cannot be found through other channels (e.g., forums and
search engines). Two of these software can place bulk orders
with fake accounts and the other three are for scalping tasks
monitoring and gathering. By reverse-engineering their code
and analyzing their trafﬁc, we discovered that several private
APIs of Company A are exploited to automatically place
orders, registering accounts, and monitoring and receiving
coupons. We reported these software and our ﬁndings to
Company A, which informed us that the abused private APIs
and two of the software have never been known before.
Also interestingly, even SIM gateways seem to be replaced
by software only shared during a conversation, a strategy that
has never been known to the cybercrime research community
and the e-commerce industry before. Speciﬁcally, from the
conversations with the 185 SIM farmers, we received 16 SIM
gateway software instead of the online SIM gateway websites.
Unlike the ﬁndings reported in the prior research [44], such
gateway software seem to be increasingly popular in the
SIM farm business, allowing their customers to choose phone
numbers from speciﬁc carriers and locations, etc. From the
software, we obtained 323K fraud phone numbers via its API,
800 times more than those gleaned in the previous study [44].
B. Value of One-on-One Intelligence
To understand the value of one-on-one chat, we compared
the information collected from the multicast group and that
