### A Second Look at Detecting Third-Party Addresses in Traceroute Traces

#### Abstract
This paper re-examines the detection of third-party addresses in traceroute traces, focusing on the reliability of current techniques that use pre-specified timestamps. We analyze traceroutes from eight Ark monitors to 80,000 randomly chosen destinations and find that a significant fraction of IP addresses in traceroute paths are in-bound interfaces on point-to-point (pt2pt) links. Our results contradict previous findings by Marchetta et al. [14], indicating that current methods for inferring third-party addresses are unreliable.

#### Introduction
Traceroute is a critical tool for uncovering Autonomous System (AS) topologies, but it can introduce artifacts such as third-party addresses, leading to incorrect AS link inferences. This paper evaluates the effectiveness of existing techniques for detecting these third-party addresses and proposes a more reliable method.

#### Methodology
We conducted traceroute measurements from eight Ark monitors to 80,000 randomly selected destinations. We used both ICMP and UDP probes with pre-specified timestamp options to infer in-bound and out-bound interfaces on pt2pt links.

#### Results
- **In-bound Interface Analysis:**
  - For 7 out of 8 vantage points (VPs), at least half of the interfaces in each path were in-bound interfaces.
  - The fraction of in-bound interfaces ranged from 26.1% to 72.5%, with some VPs showing no in-bound interfaces (e.g., zrh2-ch).

- **Timestamp Insertion:**
  - Of the 77,348 interfaces that embedded 1-3 timestamps in response to ICMP probes, 38.7% (29,930) were inferred to be in-bound interfaces.
  - However, most UDP G|BBBB probes across these pt2pt links obtained zero timestamps, leading to misclassification as off-path.

- **Consistency of Classifications:**
  - Table 2 shows that 70.9% to 74.5% of interfaces consistently did not insert timestamps when visited, regardless of the destination probed.
  - This suggests that routers that insert timestamps in ICMP B|BBBB probes often do not insert them in UDP G|BBBB probes.

- **Load-Balancing Impact:**
  - We investigated the possibility that load-balancing routers could explain the prevalence of off-path inferences.
  - Per-destination load-balancers, which do not consider bytes 20-23, are more common than per-flow load-balancers.
  - Figure 4 shows that 5.6% of interfaces were consistently inferred to be off-path despite being traversed by at least eight source-destination pairs with UDP G|BBBB probes.

- **Scatter Plot Analysis:**
  - Figure 5 presents a scatter plot of in-bound interfaces that were inferred to be on-path for some source-destination pairs and off-path for others.
  - Most interfaces were inferred to be on-path for just one source-destination pair using the technique from [14].

#### Conclusion and Future Work
Our findings indicate that the majority of IP addresses in traceroute paths are in-bound interfaces on pt2pt links, contrary to the results in [14]. Current techniques using pre-specified timestamps to infer third-party addresses are not reliable. We release our code for reproducibility and plan to further investigate incongruities between BGP and traceroute paths on pt2pt links. Developing a more accurate method for inferring AS links from traceroute paths remains an important challenge.
