As part of future work, we plan to explore other pattern
features like “pattern lengths,” and design other types of pass-
word composition policies for pattern-based authentication.

policies, respectively. Figure 12, 13, 14 and 15 show the
results.
These results show that even when SysPal policies are in
place, users still tend to choose patterns that are somewhat
easy to draw.
Among the top 20 most likely used patterns, we analyzed
the number of patterns that would commonly exist in given
two policies. This result is presented in Table XIV. Between
2-Point and 1-Point, over 55% of the top 20 patterns
overlapped; between 2-Point and 3-Point, over 60%
of such patterns overlapped. Between all the SysPal polices
and Original, however, less than 40% of such patterns
overlapped.

RESPONSES OF PARTICIPANTS IN THE LAB STUDY
APPENDIX D
After participating in the lab study for a day, participants
were asked several survey questions. First, we asked them
“How difﬁcult was it for you to remember your pattern?” (Q2
in Table II). Most of them answered that it was easy to set up
their patterns (93.3% for Original, 92.3% for 1-Point,
81.3% for 2-Point, respectively).
We also asked Q3 in Table II. 16 out of the 44 participants
answered that they used shapes that are “easy to generate” or
“easy to draw.” Such results were similar to those that were
observed from the online study (see Section IV-G).
