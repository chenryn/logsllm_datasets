### ATT&CK Technique Details

**ID:** T1481.002  
**Technique Name:** Bidirectional Communication

Adversaries may exploit legitimate, external web service channels to facilitate bidirectional communication between a compromised system and their command and control (C2) infrastructure. This method leverages popular websites and social media platforms to host C2 instructions, which the compromised system can then retrieve and execute. The output from these commands is subsequently sent back through the same web service channel.

The return traffic can take various forms, depending on the specific web service being used. For example:
- **Forum Comments:** The compromised system may post a comment on a forum.
- **Pull Requests:** It might issue a pull request to a development project.
- **Document Updates:** The system could update a document hosted on a web service.
- **Social Media Posts:** It may send a tweet or other social media post.

This technique allows adversaries to blend their malicious activities with legitimate web traffic, making detection more challenging.
