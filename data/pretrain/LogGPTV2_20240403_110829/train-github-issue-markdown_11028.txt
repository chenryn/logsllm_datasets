Reopens #2993. There was no reason given why they are pinned to patch
versions.
# Feature request
  * loosen dependency version restrictions
## Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
  * node_modules/ bloat
  * patches and features take more time to propagate downstream
## Describe the solution you'd like
  * pin to major version (i.e. `^`)
## Describe alternatives you've considered
  * pin to minor version (i.e. `~`)
## Additional context
`yarn check` report concerning `next`. This is run in a monorepo for a
component library that uses next for documentation.

Switching from exact version matches to major matches reduces the size of my
`node_modules` from 837MB to 785MB. While this isn't much it is still I/O that
has to run on install. Every other `next` version installed locally increases
the overall bloat.
