Question: Consider the following scenarios where a function is designed to access files within a restricted directory based on user input. Which of the following code examples correctly neutralizes path traversal attempts using '/../' sequences?
"A": "The function checks for '/../' anywhere in the input and rejects the request if found.",
"B": "The function allows paths that start with '/./' but filters any occurrence of '/../'.",
"C": "The function only removes '../' sequences at the beginning of the input.",
"D": "The function canonicalizes the path and then checks if the resolved path starts with the expected directory prefix."
