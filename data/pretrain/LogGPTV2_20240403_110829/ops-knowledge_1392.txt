User: The following is 20 lines of a system log. Each line consists of a timestamp, log level, process id, relevant software component, and the log content. Think step-by-step and step and summarize this log chunk:

Assistant: This log chunk shows four users (test, cyrus, news, and unknown) attempting to access a system. The user test was able to open and close a session, while the user cyrus was able to open a session but not close it. The other three users were all unable to authenticate, resulting in authentication failure messages.
