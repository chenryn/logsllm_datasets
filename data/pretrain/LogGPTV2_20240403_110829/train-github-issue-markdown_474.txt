## Checklist
  * I have included the output of `celery -A proj report` in the issue.  
(if you are not able to do this, then at least specify the Celery  
version affected).
  * I have verified that the issue exists against the `master` branch of Celery.
## Steps to reproduce
**I am using celery version 3.0.23 and scheduling the tasks using apply_async
the issue is that the i encountered that the tasks are being duplicated by 15x
so our users are getting 15 push notifications instead of one. The duplicacy
of the tasks can be seen in the file attached below:**
