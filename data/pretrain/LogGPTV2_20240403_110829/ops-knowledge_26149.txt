User: Please introduce the common types of web attacks and their defense measures.
Assistant: Common types of web attacks include: 1. SQL injection (SQL Injection): The attacker exploits the vulnerability that the input parameters have not been properly filtered, escaped or verified, and inject malicious SQL code into the web application to access Or manipulate data in the application. Defensive measures: Use parameterized queries to properly filter, escape, and validate user input. Also, regular vulnerability checks and penetration testing should be performed on the security of databases and applications. 2. Cross-Site Scripting (Cross-Site Scripting, XSS): Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in web applications to inject malicious script code into web pages to steal user information or perform other malicious operations. Defensive measures: Properly filter, escape, and validate user-entered data. In addition, the use of inline scripts and dynamic code execution in applications should be prohibited. 3. Cross-Site Request Forgery (Cross-Site Request Forgery, CSRF): The attacker uses the user's logged-in authentication information to initiate a forged request to the web application to perform malicious operations. Defensive measures: Use CSRF Token technology to verify the authentication information of submitted forms and requests. 4. Misconfiguration and management vulnerabilities: Attackers can obtain unauthorized information or perform malicious operations by exploiting web application configuration errors and management vulnerabilities. Defensive measures: Strict security policy control and regular security audits for configuration and management of web applications. 5. Insecure File Upload: Attackers can obtain sensitive server information or attack other users' devices by uploading malicious files. Defensive measures: limit the type and size of uploaded files, and properly filter and verify uploaded files. In addition, it is best to store uploaded files on different servers.
