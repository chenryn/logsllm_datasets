Question: "An adversary is using a popular encryption algorithm to protect their command and control (C2) communications. While the algorithm is secure, their implementation might be flawed. Which of the following scenarios could potentially expose the adversary's C2 traffic to reverse engineering and detection?"
 "A": "The adversary uses a custom, proprietary encryption algorithm instead of a known secure one."
 "B": "The adversary hardcodes secret keys within the malware's configuration files."
 "C": "The adversary employs strong, dynamically generated keys for each session."
 "D": "The adversary utilizes a standard communication protocol with no additional encryption."
Answer: B
