User: I use python 2.7 to create a spider in Pycharm to get data from website.
In the first spider I create a spider in the project folder and use os.mkdir('home/img/') to create a folder to save data. There is no error.
In the second spider I create the spider with RedisQueue which is in the project folder and put the Spider.py into /usr/lib/python2.7. when I use os.mkdir('home/img/') it reports the error 'no such file or dir' and I change it to os.makedirs() which works. 
May I know why the 1st one doesn't meet error? Thanks in advance
Assistant: Difference between os.mkdir(dirname) and os.mkdirs(dirname)
mkdir() will create only neaded directory. If some of parent directories was not existing, mkdir() will return false. mkdirs() will create the last directory with all missing parent directories.so mkdirs() is more handy.
