• Improve our practice of retrieving information: This may seem like merely exam practice at
n
first, but there’s more to it than that. A student who reads a paragraph about how to create a
file and then follows along to create a file independently is working on memory retrieval.
i
The more we work to improve in these three areas, the better we will be at remembering and
z
learning. We also know that repeating information while changing the delivery mode can also be
helpful.
D
Taking in the same information via a secondary method, for example, reading an explanation and
then watching a video about the same topic, is called Dual Coding. The basic principle behind Dual
Coding is that repeatedly studying the same information through different means improves
retention.

example of Dual Coding itself. By combining the text paragraph explaining the process of reading

about a concept and combining it with explanatory visual aids, the information is better imprinted

There is an increasing amount of research, including repeatable experiments and evidence from
neuroimaging, that supports Dual Coding as an effective learning strategy.134

4.1.3 The Forgetting Curvez and Cognitive Load
In a fictional tale by JorgDe Luis Borges, a character named Funes the Memorious135 could
remember in vivid detail every single thing he witnessed. Unfortunately, most of us aren’t blessed
with this gift. Two of the most common problems we encounter when trying to learn something
(or create a memory) are “too long ago” or “too much information at once”.
Let’s start by examining the problem of forgetting. In 1885, learning scientist Hermann
Ebbinghaus set out to memorize a few documents, then tested himself repeatedly on what he
remembered. He was only able to remember all of the details if he tested himself immediately
after memorizing. Ebbinghaus found he only remembered 100 percent of the information at the
time of acquisition. After that, he started forgetting information very quickly. When he waited 20
minutes, he could only remember 58%. A day later, he could only remember 23%. He called this
decline The Forgetting Curve.136

Figure 2: Ebbinghaus’ Forgetting Curve
o
Thankfully, almost 150 years later, most of us have search engines and other tools available to us
that Ebbinghaus did not.137 For example, if we forget the specific command to rename a file in
Linux, such as mv oldfilename.txt newfilenanme.txt, we can quickly and easily Google it.
This is great news, since it means our learning approach doesn’t need to be centered around
i
memorizing facts. Instead, we can shift our focus to learning a method (in this case, our method
might be to Google the commandz we need).
The second problem, which we’ve referred to as “too much information at once”, is usually
D
referred to as Cognitive Load.138
To better understand cognitive load, it may be helpful to imagine our brain as sort of a room, with
pieces of information (that take up space) moving in and out. At some point, if more and more
information keeps coming in, there simply isn’t enough space for everything to stay organized.
Pretty soon, the room is too full and there isn’t enough space for more to come in through the
door.
To remedy this, instructors may try reducing what is called “extraneous load.” These are extra
pieces of new information that aren’t important or necessary. Let’s go back to our example of
renaming a file. Imagine that our instructor also explained that this command is exactly the same
as the command we might use if we wanted to change the location of the file to the exact same
directory and then giving it a new name. While technically true, it’s possible that this bit of
information would not improve our understanding of renaming files. Instead, trying to understand
“relocating something to it’s original location” might take up additional mental capacity, actually
impeding our learning.

It’s easy to imagine how disorganized instructional materials might increase cognitive load, but
the same is also true for the classroom or environment where the student is physically located. A
noisy coffee shop is full of smells, conversations, people, and movement--all of which our brains
are constantly taking in. In the case of online learning, students may need to reduce extraneous
load in the physical learning space itself. We’ll explore this more later.
4.2 Unique Challenges to Learning Technical Skills
Next, let’s examine some of the other unique challenges that we will face when trying to learn
technical skills.
This Learning Unit covers the following Learning Objectives:
1. Recognize the differences and advantages of digital learning materials
y
2. Understand the challenge of preparing for unknown scenarios
3. Understand the potential challenges of remote or asynchronous learning
k
While each student will learn at their own pace, this Learning Unit should take about ten minutes
to complete. s
4.2.1 Digital vs. Print Materials
o
Let’s consider the difference between learning in the OffSec Portal versus more traditional
learning experiences like reading from a bnook. Technical skills such as coding are often taught
using materials on the same medium where the practical work is done (a screen). This is the case
with the OffSec Library.
i
Some studies have been done onz the difference between learning on a screen or from a book,139
and researchers have even explored whether or not the size of the screen matters. Interestingly,
the research shows relevanDt information.
Among the findings are that smaller screens may make learning more difficult and that
individuals who read books tend to understand the information more fully. There are payoffs and
drawbacks to both approaches. Sometimes screen reading can cause visual or sensory fatigue.
Students learning in a digital context have easy access to a number of tools, including the ability
to quickly and easily reference additional materials (for example, looking up the definition of a
new vocabulary word). On the other hand, sometimes the act of reading forces one into a
distraction-free environment that allows for deeper focus.140
The second, and perhaps the more important thing to note here, has to do with a concept known
as Contextual Learning.141 Although we can’t explore all of its details in this Module, this concept
suggests that even on an intuitive level, we know that it’s easier to learn how to build a house on a
construction site.
In other words, when the training material is presented in the same context as the skill that we’re
trying to learn, our brain has to do less translation work and can accept the new information more

readily. This doesn’t mean that books about computers are worthless - it just means that our
brains have to do more work to assimilate information from the page and think about it in the
context of the computer screen.
4.2.2 Expecting the Unexpected
There is another unique challenge that we will face in learning cyber security. This field is
consistently focused on trying to prepare for situations we can’t possibly predict.
Let’s consider a couple of simple examples. We might learn about Enterprise Network
Architecture, which examines the way a business organizes servers, workstations, and devices on
a network. Unfortunately, as in-depth as that Module might go, it’s unlikely to cover the exact
network architecture that we’ll encounter in some future scenario. In another Module, we might
thoroughly and perfectly understand a specific attack vector, and we might even be able to
execute it in the lab environment, but that doesn’t mean we will encoyunter that exact vector in all
future environments.
k
We also must take into account that the entire field of cyber security is constantly evolving. New
vulnerabilities are discovered all the time. A network that is secure today may not be secure in six
months. A student needs to be able to exceed their initsial training in order to remain effective in
the field.
o
In this way, learning about cyber security is similar to learning transversal skills142 like leadership,
communication, and teamwork. As with these skills, we cannot afford to focus on memorizing a
series of steps to take. There is no simpnle, straightforward standard operating procedure for
building better teamwork just as there is no simple, straightforward standard operating procedure
for exploit development. Instead, we need to focus on understanding methods, techniques, and
i
the purpose behind certain actions.
z
Let’s return briefly to our example of learning how to secure a network. We mentioned that “A
network that is secure todDay may not be secure in six months.” The best approach to this
problem is not to learn a series of steps we can follow to make that network secure today, then
learn a new set of steps in six months. The solution is to learn the methodology and the purpose
behind each security step. When new risks arise, we’ll apply the same methodology, adapting and
evolving along with the changing threat landscape.
Later in this Module we will discuss some potential approaches that can help us do this.
4.2.3 The Challenges of Remote and Asynchronous Learning
There is one more aspect of this particular type of learning that we will want to take into
consideration--the fact that this is a remote learning environment. During the global COVID-19
pandemic, many schools adopted distance learning for the first time, and students of all ages
faced the new challenges143 presented by trying to learn via a computer monitor at home.
We must also consider that some online learning is asynchronous, meaning the instructor may
not be present in a Zoom call or classroom to deliver a lecture, instruction, or to answer

questions. Instead, the student can participate in the class at whatever hour or pace works best
for them. There are some definite advantages and disadvantages to this type of learning.
Students in a remote, asynchronous learning environment should be aware of two things:
1. The advantages that come from the peer support, community, and camaraderie of other
students in a traditional classroom setting is no longer a guarantee.
2. The pace and timing of the course is largely the student’s responsibility.
We will discuss some practical solutions to the second item shortly, but in order to connect with a
wider community of learners, OffSec students have a community of co-learners available on the
OffSec Discord Server.144 There may also be local meetups or other communities available to a
student. Seeking out support and help (as well as helping and supporting others in turn) has
benefits far beyond the classroom as well.
y
4.3 OffSec Training Methodology
k
Now that we’ve examined some of the challenges we’ll face as students, let’s explore how the
structure and design of OffSec training materials will help us.
s
We won’t be able to go into detail on everything that goes into creating meaningful and useful
training.145 Instead, we’ll focus on a few of the moore noticeable strategies that we, as students,
will be able to take advantage of.
This Learning Unit covers the following Leanrning Objectives:
1. Understand what is meant by a Demonstrative Methodology
i
2. Understand the challenge of zpreparing for unknown scenarios
3. Understand the potential challenges of remote or asynchronous learning
D
While each student will learn at their own pace, this Learning Unit should take about 15 minutes
to complete.
4.3.1 The Demonstration Method
As one might infer from the name, using the Demonstration Method means showing (or acting
out) what one hopes the student will be able to accomplish. To illustrate this, let’s return briefly to
our example of learning to rename a file in Linux.
One way to provide this information is to be very direct.
Use the "mv" command.
Listing 10 - Not using the demonstration method.
Although this is technically correct, a student might still not fully understand how to use this
information. An instructor using the demonstration method will follow the exact steps that a
student should follow, including the resulting output of running the command. The relevant
information might be better presented with a code block.

Before showing the code block, we would first lay out our plan and detail any new or interesting
commands we’re planning on running. Here we might discuss that we’ll use ls *.txt to list any .txt
files in the directory. Next, we will run our renaming command, mv oldfilename.txt
newfilename.txt. Finally, we’ll use ls *.txt to check if our command worked.
kali@kali:~$ ls *.txt
oldfilename.txt
kali@kali:~$ mv oldfilename.txt newfilename.txt
kali@kali:~$ ls *.txt
newfilename.txt
Listing 11 - Renaming a file and checking our results.
After the code listing, we would explain our results. In this case, we listed the .txt files and only
had one, named oldfilename.txt. We then ran our renaming commanyd and received no output, as
expected. Finally, we checked our results by running ls *.txt again. This time, the output shows the
only .txt file in the directory is newfilename.txt. We could takke further steps to ensure this file
contains the same contents as earlier, and that only the filename has changed.
s
While it may seem unnecessary to include these extra items, this sort of demonstration and
description begins to expose the thought process that a student will need to learn. We verified our
work in this case and checked that our commando worked. Although that’s not necessarily part of
renaming a file, getting in the habit of checking our work is an excellent habit to adopt.
Sometimes the material will take what feelsn like a longer route in order to show both the new skill
and a useful context. It may also actively expose and discuss the instructor’s “mistakes” and
redirections. Demonstrating a thought process in this manner is called modeling,146 and was
i
developed as a way to teach critical thinking skills.147
z
4.3.2 Learning by Doing
D
Doing something helps us learn it. There is an absolute wealth of research to support learning by
doing as a method that increases memory retention and improves the overall educational
experience of a learner.148,149,150,151
We know this method works well for learners, and OffSec has applied it in several ways.

3. The Challenge Labs
4. Proving Grounds
The training materials themselves will always trend toward focusing on scenarios that we can
follow along with. There are times when we need to discuss a bit of theory so that we have
enough background to go deeper, but in general, if the material can demonstrate working through
a problem, then the expectation is that the student should be able to follow along. Often a virtual
machine (VM) is specifically built in order to accommodate this.
The Module Exercises themselves will often involve working with a VM as well. This is the
approach as often as is reasonably possible, but with some Modules (this one, for example) that
are more theoretical, exercises are presented in a more standard question-and-answer format.
The OffSec Library also contains Challenge Labs, which take the exercises one step further. A
Challenge Lab is, essentially, an environment of additional practice eyxercises specifically created
to help learners prepare for an exam (which, perhaps as expected, is also hands-on). We highly
recommend that students take advantage of this additional opkportunity.
Finally, we leverage assessments and exams. These are exercises and networked lab
s
environments specifically for proving the skills we’ve learned. Since a real world environment will
not give us a clear indication for which vulnerabilities might be present on a system, we don’t
create a 1:1 link between a course module and aon assessment (for example, we don’t advertise
whether or not a machine is vulnerable to privilege escalation).
With this in mind, the skills and methods sntudents will learn in the courses are directly applicable
in the assessment and exam environments.

4.3.3 Facing Difficulty
z
There is a common expression that “practice makes perfect”. That may be true, but it begs the
question, what makes for idDeal practice?
Let’s consider the following experiment that was performed in 1978.152 A group of 8-year-old
children were divided into two groups to practice a simple task: toss a small bean bag into a
target hole. After being introduced to the task with the target at a distance of three feet (about 90
cm), the groups spent the next three months practicing. One group kept practicing with the target
at the same distance. The other aimed at a pair of targets - practicing with distances of both two
feet (60 cm) and four feet (120 cm).
