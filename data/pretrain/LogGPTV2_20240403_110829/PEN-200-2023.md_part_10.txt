### Improving Information Retrieval Practices

At first glance, improving information retrieval may seem like a mere exercise for exams. However, it is much more than that. For instance, when a student reads a paragraph on how to create a file and then follows the steps to create the file independently, they are engaging in memory retrieval. The more we focus on enhancing these three areas—reading, following, and practicing—the better we become at remembering and learning. Additionally, repeating information through different modes of delivery can be highly beneficial.

For example, taking in the same information via a secondary method, such as reading an explanation and then watching a video on the same topic, is known as Dual Coding. The principle behind Dual Coding is that repeatedly studying the same information through different means improves retention. This is supported by research, including repeatable experiments and evidence from neuroimaging (Harvard, 2022).

**Figure 1: Dual Coding**

The image above not only illustrates Dual Coding but also serves as an example of it. By combining a text paragraph with explanatory visual aids, the information is better imprinted into our brains. Research increasingly supports Dual Coding as an effective learning strategy (Cuevas, 2014).

### 4.1.3 The Forgetting Curve and Cognitive Load

In a fictional tale by Jorge Luis Borges, a character named Funes the Memorious could remember every detail he witnessed. Unfortunately, most of us do not have this gift. Two common problems we face when trying to learn or create a memory are "too long ago" and "too much information at once."

Let's start with the problem of forgetting. In 1885, learning scientist Hermann Ebbinghaus conducted an experiment where he memorized documents and tested himself repeatedly. He found that he could only remember 100% of the information immediately after memorizing it. After 20 minutes, he could recall only 58%, and after a day, only 23%. This decline is known as the Forgetting Curve (wikipedia, 2022).

**Figure 2: Ebbinghaus’ Forgetting Curve**

Fortunately, today we have search engines and other tools that Ebbinghaus did not. For example, if we forget the specific command to rename a file in Linux, such as `mv oldfilename.txt newfilename.txt`, we can quickly Google it. This means our learning approach doesn't need to focus on memorizing facts; instead, we can focus on learning methods, such as using Google to find commands.

The second problem, often referred to as "too much information at once," is known as Cognitive Load. To understand cognitive load, imagine the brain as a room where pieces of information take up space. If too much information keeps coming in, the room becomes too full, and there isn't enough space for more. To address this, instructors can reduce "extraneous load"—extra, non-essential information. For example, explaining that the `mv` command is the same as changing a file's location and renaming it might add unnecessary complexity, impeding learning (Loveless, 2022).

### 4.2 Unique Challenges to Learning Technical Skills

Next, let's examine some unique challenges in learning technical skills.

#### 4.2.1 Digital vs. Print Materials

Consider the difference between learning in the OffSec Portal and traditional learning, such as reading from a book. Technical skills like coding are often taught using materials on the same medium where the practical work is done, such as a screen. Some studies have explored the differences between learning on a screen and from a book. Smaller screens may make learning more difficult, and individuals who read books tend to understand the information more fully. There are pros and cons to both approaches. Screen reading can cause visual fatigue, but it provides easy access to additional resources. Reading from a book, on the other hand, can offer a distraction-free environment for deeper focus (Szalavitz, 2012; Oxford Learning, 2021).

Another important concept is Contextual Learning, which suggests that learning is easier when the training material is presented in the same context as the skill being learned. For example, it’s easier to learn how to build a house on a construction site. This doesn't mean books about computers are worthless; it just means our brains have to do more work to assimilate the information (Imel, 2000).

#### 4.2.2 Expecting the Unexpected

Cybersecurity is a field that constantly prepares for unpredictable situations. For example, learning about Enterprise Network Architecture may not cover the exact network architecture encountered in the future. Similarly, understanding a specific attack vector in a lab environment doesn’t guarantee encountering the same vector in all future scenarios. The field is always evolving, with new vulnerabilities discovered regularly. A network secure today may not be secure in six months. Therefore, students need to focus on understanding methodologies and the purpose behind security steps, rather than memorizing specific procedures (Lopez and Rodriguez-Lopez, 2020).

#### 4.2.3 The Challenges of Remote and Asynchronous Learning

Remote and asynchronous learning present unique challenges. During the global COVID-19 pandemic, many schools adopted distance learning, and students faced new challenges. In asynchronous learning, the instructor may not be present to deliver lectures or answer questions. Students must be aware of two things:
1. The peer support and camaraderie of a traditional classroom setting are no longer guaranteed.
2. The pace and timing of the course are largely the student's responsibility.

To connect with a wider community of learners, OffSec students can use the OffSec Discord Server and seek out local meetups or other communities (Minnesota State, 2022).

### 4.3 OffSec Training Methodology

Now, let's explore how the structure and design of OffSec training materials help students.

#### 4.3.1 The Demonstration Method

The Demonstration Method involves showing what the student should accomplish. For example, to teach how to rename a file in Linux, an instructor would lay out the plan, detail any new commands, and show the results step-by-step. This method exposes the thought process needed for the task and helps students develop good habits, such as verifying their work (Intel, 2012; Daniel et al., 2005).

#### 4.3.2 Learning by Doing

Research shows that hands-on learning increases memory retention and improves the educational experience (Koedinger et al., 2015; Bates, 2015; Boser, 2020; Djavad Mowafaghain Centre for Brain Health, 2018). OffSec applies this method through:
1. Training Materials
2. Module Exercises
3. Challenge Labs
4. Proving Grounds

Training materials focus on scenarios that students can follow along with, often using virtual machines. Module Exercises involve working with VMs, and Challenge Labs provide additional practice for exam preparation. Assessments and exams are designed to test the skills learned in a real-world context.

#### 4.3.3 Facing Difficulty

The adage "practice makes perfect" is true, but what constitutes ideal practice? Consider an experiment from 1978 where 8-year-old children practiced tossing a bean bag into a target hole. One group practiced at a fixed distance, while the other practiced at varying distances. The latter group performed better, suggesting that varied and challenging practice is more effective (Schmidt and Bjork, 1992).
