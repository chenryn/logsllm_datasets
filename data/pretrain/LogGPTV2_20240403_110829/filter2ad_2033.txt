As  systems  become  increasingly  connected  to  an  increasingly  diverse  set  of  other  systems  and 
environments,  architects  will  lose  their  ability  to  intricately  plan  interactions  among  system  components, 
because an increasing fraction of those interactions will be with foreign and possibly unanticipated systems 
or components.  Humans  will  be increasingly  less competent to install, configure, optimize,  maintain, and 
merge massive, complex, and heterogeneous computing systems. They will not be able to make sufficiently 
quick, decisive responses to a rapid stream of changing and conflicting demands. 
To meet these new and vast challenges, systems need to be designed so that they are self-managing. Self-
managing systems automate all phases in the life-cycle of complex computing systems, from installation to 
run-time  maintenance  and  optimization.  This  workshop  will  provide  a  forum  for  a  small  group  of 
participants  to  consider  new  paradigms,  system  designs,  and  algorithms  for  self-managing  computing 
systems.
