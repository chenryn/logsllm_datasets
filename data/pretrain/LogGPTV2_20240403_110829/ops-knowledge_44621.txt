Question: In reviewing the security of a blockchain ledger, you come across Block 4 in a hash chain. What aspects of Block 4 contribute to the overall security of the blockchain, and how do they prevent tampering with the ledger?
"A": "Block 4 contains a digest of all messages up to \(m_4\), which helps detect unauthorized modifications to previous blocks.",
"B": "Block 4 includes only the message \(m_4\), minimizing the block size and thus increasing the efficiency of the ledger.",
"C": "Block 4 contains a hash that does not depend on previous blocks, ensuring the privacy of earlier transactions.",
"D": "Block 4 includes the hash of Block 3, creating a chain that secures the integrity of the ledger by linking each block to its predecessor."
