User: I have installed both versions of python that is python 2.7 and python 3.5.3. When I run python command in command prompt, python 3.5.3 interpreter shows up. How can I switch to python 2.7 interpreter?
Assistant: As has been mentioned in other answers to this and similar questions, if you're using Windows, cmd reads down the PATH variable from the top down. On my system I have Python 3.8 and 3.10 installed. I wanted my cmd to solely use 3.8, so I moved it to the top of the PATH variable and the next time I opened cmd and used python --version it returned 3.8.
Hopefully this is useful for future devs researching this specific question.
