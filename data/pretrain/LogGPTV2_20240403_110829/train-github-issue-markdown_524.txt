/Users/jra/bin/gomobile: type github.com/kellydunn/golang-geo.Point not
defined in package package marshrutme ("github.com/jeffallen/marshrutme")
"in package package" is because the error is "in package %s", with %s filled
by a types.Package, which has a String() method that puts "package" on the
front.
There are several occurrences of "in package" in gengo.go that probably all
need fixing.
