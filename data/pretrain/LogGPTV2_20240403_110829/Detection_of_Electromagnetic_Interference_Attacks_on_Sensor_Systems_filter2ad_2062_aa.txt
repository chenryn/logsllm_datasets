Abstract—Sensor systems are used every time a micro-
controller needs to interact with the physical world. They are
abundant in home automation, factory control systems, critical
infrastructure, transport systems and many, many other things.
In a sensor system, a sensor transforms a physical quantity into
an analog signal which is sent to an ADC and a microcontroller
for digitization and further processing. Once the measurement is
in digital form, the microcontroller can execute tasks according
to the measurement. Electromagnetic interference (EMI) can
affect a measurement as it is transferred to the microcontroller.
An attacker can manipulate the sensor output by intentionally
inducing EMI in the wire between the sensor and the micro-
controller. The nature of the analog channel between the sensor
and the microcontroller means that the microcontroller cannot
authenticate whether the measurement is from the sensor or the
attacker. If the microcontroller includes incorrect measurements
in its control decisions, it could have disastrous consequences.
We present a novel detection system for these low-level
electromagnetic interference attacks. Our system is based on
the idea that if the sensor is turned off, the signal read by the
microcontroller should be 0V (or some other known value). We
use this idea to modulate the sensor output in a way that is
unpredictable to the adversary. If the microcontroller detects
ﬂuctuations in the sensor output, the attacking signal can be
detected. Our proposal works with a minimal amount of extra
components and is thus cheap and easy to implement.
We present the working mechanism of our detection method
and prove the detection guarantee in the context of a strong
attacker model. We implement our approach in order to detect
adversarial EMI signals, both in a microphone system and a
temperature sensor system, and we show that our detection
mechanism is both effective and robust.
I. INTRODUCTION
A sensor is an interface between the physical world and an
electronic circuit, and it is the device that can convert physical
quantities such as temperature, gravity, and sound into electrical
signals in the form of analog voltages. Sensors are widely
applied in our daily lives. For example, in our smartphones,
an ambient light sensor measures light so that the brightness
of the screen can be adjusted accordingly; an accelerometer
can monitor motion of the smartphone, and thus the phone can
track user’s steps. A microphone is also a sensor that collects
audio signals such as voice commands. Sensors can also be
found in critical applications such as automobiles and nuclear
plants. For example, a light detecting and ranging (LiDAR)
sensor helps the automobile to see the surroundings, and a
temperature sensor can monitor a temperature of a cooling
system of a nuclear reactor. Sensors are highly integrated into
our infrastructure and modern life in general, and hence it is
essential to be concerned with the security and correctness of
sensor measurements.
In a sensor system, a sensor transforms a physical quantity
into an analog signal which is sent to a microcontroller. Without
an authentication scheme, the microcontroller has no choice
but to trust the measurement. The wire that connects the
sensor to the microcontroller is subject to electromagnetic
interference (EMI). An attacker can use EMI to remotely,
using easily available radio equipment, inject an attacking
signal into the sensor system and change the sensor output,
regardless of the sensor type. We cover this process in detail
in Section II. As a result, the attacker can manipulate the
microcontroller into believing that a measurement was obtained
by the legitimate sensor. For example, an air conditioner
can adjust the temperature of the air according to the room
temperature. Suppose an attacker remotely sends an attacking
signal to hold the sensor output at a level that corresponds
to a low temperature, the air conditioner is deceived into
continuously expelling hot air. As a result, the room becomes
warmer and warmer. This might seem rather harmless, but a
similar attack can be done to the cooling system of a nuclear
power plant, or the pitch control of a ﬂy-by-wire helicopter.
To protect a sensor system from attacks, existing defense
strategies such as shielding and EMI ﬁlters have been well
studied. Although shielding and EMI ﬁlters can signiﬁcantly
attenuate EMI, they do not fully block interference, nor do they
provide the system with an ability to detect an attacking signal.
In this paper we propose a novel defense method to detect an
attack. Our method is based on the idea that when the sensor
has its power switched off, the output of the sensor should be
“quiet”. If an attacking signal is maliciously induced into the
sensor system during the “quiet” period, the microcontroller
can detect this.
We summarize our contributions as follows:
• We propose a novel method to detect EMI attacks by
modulating the sensor power, and monitoring the output.
• We analyze the security of the detection method and prove
that our method can be bypassed only with a negligible
probability.
• We deploy the detection method on an off-the-shelf
microphone module as well as a thermistor, to demonstrate
the feasibility and robustness of discovering an attacking
signal for both constant and non-constant signals.

In the following sections, we ﬁrst brieﬂy present some
background on EMI attacks and explain how to remotely
inject a malicious signal into a sensor system in Section II. In
Section III, we present an overview of our detection scheme and
introduce the system and adversarial model. In Section IV, we
present in detail how our defence method works and we analyze
the security of the method. Then, in Section V, we show how
to still maintain some security guarantee even if the measured
quantity becomes non-constant (in the measuring period).
Implementations of the detection method in a microphone
system and a temperature sensor system are described in
Section VI. We discuss a few additional points in Section VII
and summarize related work in Section VIII. Finally, the whole
work is concluded in Section IX.
II. BACKGROUND ON ELECTROMAGNETIC INTERFERENCE
ATTACK AGAINST SENSOR SYSTEM
In recent years, sensor systems have been widely deployed
in different applications such as smart devices and automobiles.
Attackers can exploit electromagnetic interference (EMI) to
modify sensor readings, and such attacks may threaten users’
privacy and safety. In this section, we show a general model
of sensor systems, and we explain how to inject a malicious
signal into the sensor system remotely.
A. A Model of Sensor Systems
As shown in Figure 1, a sensor system consists of two
essential modules: a sensor and a microcontroller. The sensor
outputs a measurement
to the microcontroller through a
wire. An attacker can interfere with the sensor output by
injecting an attacking signal
into the sensor system (see
details in Section II-B). When the attacking signal enters the
sensor system, it is superimposed with the sensor output. The
malicious sensor output is digitized by an analog-to-digital
converter (ADC) in the microcontroller, and ﬁnally, an incorrect
digitized sensor output is processed by the microcontroller.
B. Injecting Malicious Signals into Sensor Systems
EMI attacks can be categorized into two types: high-power
EMI attacks and low-power EMI attacks. The high-power EMI
attacks refer to disruption, jamming and burning to the victim
system. Sabath [22] summarizes a series of criminal uses of
high-power EMI tools that result in degradation or loss of
the main function of the victim’s system, where technical
defects, economic losses, and disasters occur. Various defense
methods against the high-power EMI attacks have been studied
thoroughly in previous studies [1], [2], [4], [12], [15], [18],
[19], [28].
In this paper, we focus on low-power EMI attacks, in which
the attacker manipulates the sensors of a victim to report the
values that the attacker wishes. Examples of low-power EMI
attacks can be found in prior work [10], [14], [16], [24].
To change sensor readings successfully, the attacker relies on
two features of a sensor system: one is that the wire connecting
the sensor and the microcontroller acts as an unintentional
antenna; the other one is nonlinearity of electronic components
or undersampling of an ADC. The attacker’s objective is adding
a malicious signal to the sensor output. The attacker generates
an attacking signal by modulating a high-frequency carrier
signal. This signal is picked up by the wire connecting the
sensor to the microcontroller and will cause the microcontroller
to read a false value [9], [11], [16], [24]. Many researchers,
including [7], [8], [10], [14], [16], [21], [27], [29], [30], exploit
the nonlinearity of electronic components to inject arbitrary data
into sensors. This data can be amplitude, frequency or phase
modulated (AM, FM, or PM) onto the carrier. By injecting
a signal with a frequency that exceeds the sampling rate of
the ADC, the ADC will undersample the attacking signal at
a speciﬁed interval and skip high-frequency oscillations [16],
[17]. This means that the ADC can be abused to work as a
demodulator for the attacking signal. As a result, the malicious
signal is superimposed with the legitimate sensor output.
III. OUR APPROACH
In this section, we brieﬂy introduce three classes of sensors
on which our method is effective before explaining the core
idea of our approach. The details of our defence scheme, and
a careful security analysis are presented in Section IV. In this
section we also, present the system- and adversarial models.
We classify sensors into three main types: active sensors,
powered passive sensors, and non-powered passive sensors.
An active sensor consists of an emitter and a receiver. The
emitter sends out a signal to be reﬂected by a measured
entity, and the receiver gathers information from the reﬂected
signal. Examples of active sensors are ultrasonic sensors and
infrared sensors. A powered passive sensor or a non-powered
passive sensor has no emitter, and the sensor directly senses
the physical phenomenon such as vibration or radiation of the
measured entity. A powered passive sensor needs an external
excitation signal or a power signal when it works. Examples
of such sensors are microphones, light dependent resistors, and
thermistors. A non-powered passive sensor does not need any
external power signal. When the non-powered passive sensor is
exposed to an entity that is expected to be measured, the sensor
generates an output, which can be a voltage signal or a current
signal. Sensors such as piezoelectric sensors, photodiodes, and
thermocouples are non-powered passive sensors. Our approach
modiﬁes the way that the powered/non-powered passive sensor
works; since the receiver of an active sensor is a powered/non-
powered passive sensor, our approach also works for the active
sensor. To simplify our exposition, in the rest of the paper, we
use the powered passive sensor as an example to explain our
approach. In Section VII-C, we will further illustrate how to
suit our approach to the non-powered passive sensor. Unless
clock cycle (see Figure 2). In our approach, the Manchester
encoded code is encoded from an n-bit randomized secret
sequence of zeros and ones. Because the secret sequence is
randomized, the sensor is switched on and off randomly, and
hence the sensor output has a randomized on-and-off pattern. In
our approach, we assume that the physical quantity is constant
(see details in Section III-B). Since the physical quantity is
constant, as shown in Figure 2, the waveform of the sensor
output is similar to the Manchester encoded code.
A built-in ADC digitizes the sensor output, and the micro-
controller decides whether an attack occurs by checking the
digitized sensor output. As shown in Figure 2, the secret
sequence has n bits, and thus the Manchester encoded code
has n clock cycles. Accordingly, the sensor output has n clock
cycles. We deﬁne each clock cycle of the sensor output as a sub-
measurement, and all n sub-measurements form a measurement.
Further, each sub-measurement is digitized into two samples by
the ADC: one is sampled when the sensor is biased at the high
voltage, and the value of the sample is non-zero volt; the other
sample is digitized when the sensor is biased at 0 V, and the
value of the sample is 0 V. The microcontroller can align the
digitized signal with the secret sequence precisely, and hence,
given any sample, the microcontroller knows whether it should
be zero or non-zero. Hereafter, based on the microcontroller’s
knowledge of the secret sequence, a sample that should be
non-zero is called as a “non-zero sample”, and a sample that
should be zero is called as a “zero sample”.
Under an attack, either a zero or a non-zero sample in a
sub-measurement can be inﬂuenced by the attacking signal.
If the attacker alters a zero sample, the microcontroller can
spot the attack immediately, as the voltage level of the zero
sample is not 0 V. Conversely, if the attacker alters a non-zero
sample, she will also be detected quickly. This is because
that the physical quantity should remain unchanged during
a measurement, and all non-zero samples should be equal;
however, the changed non-zero sample has a different voltage
level from the other non-zero samples, and hence the attack is
detected. Our detection approach are detailed in Section IV.
If the sensor system does not detect any attacking signal, the
quantiﬁcation of the physical quantity is the value of a non-zero
sample. In practice, noise must be considered. As shown in
Figure 2, since the sensor output is noisy, the non-zero samples
vary slightly in a small range. Thus, the quantiﬁcation is an
average of all non-zero samples. To simplify the exposition,
noise is ignored in Section IV and Section V. How to handle
noise will be detailed in Section VI.
Note that researchers [26] have proposed a defense strategy
named PyCRA, which detects sensor spooﬁng attacks by
turning off the emitter in an active sensor. Details of the working
