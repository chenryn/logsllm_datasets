User: I recently made a django project using virtualenv on my mac. That mac broke, but I saved the files and now I want to work on my project using my linux computer. I am now having some difficulty running the virtual environment in Ubuntu. 
Does it even make sense to try and use a virtual env made in Mac OS on Ubuntu?
Thanks
Assistant: You can just recreate the virtual environment on Ubuntu.  The virtual env will have the python binary which will be different on a different system.
