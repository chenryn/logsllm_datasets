User: I am running Pylons on my local machine with paster, and on a Debian server using WSGI. I want to add some print statements to debug a problem: am not a Pylons or Python expert.
On my local machine this works fine: print statements go to the terminal. On the server, the statements don't print to the log files: instead the log file says "IOError: failed to write data" whenever a print statement is called.
Until I can fix this, I can't debug anything on the server. 
Could someone advise how to get printing running on the server? Thanks!
Assistant: Don't use print statements, use the logging module. We can't help you without knowing the setup of the server.
