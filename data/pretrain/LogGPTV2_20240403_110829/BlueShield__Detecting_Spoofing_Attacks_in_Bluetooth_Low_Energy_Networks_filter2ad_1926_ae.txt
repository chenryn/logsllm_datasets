A RSSI Inspection
Inspection mechanism. To detect anomalies in RSSI val-
ues under the presence of strong signal reﬂections in BLE
networks, we employ the two-component Gaussian mixture
model. This is because the distribution of RSSI values in
noise-rich environments can be modeled using two normal
distributions [35]. The probability distribution function of
RSSI values can be represented by
fr(yi) = w·
1
σ1√2π · e−
(yi−µ1)2
2σ2
1 + (1− w)·
1
σ2√2π · e−
(yi−µ2)2
2σ2
2
,
(1)
where µ1 and µ2 represent means of the two components,
σ1 and σ2 represent standard deviations of the two compo-
nents, w represents a weight parameter, and yi denotes an
RSSI sample. In BlueShield, the monitor utilizes Nl RSSI
values of advertising packets in the lookback window to learn
values of µ1, µ2, σ1, σ2 and w using a conventional expec-
tation–maximization (EM) algorithm [29]. Then, the mon-
itor computes the negative log-likelihood that RSSI values
(yi, ∀i ∈ [1, No]) of advertising packets in the observation
window come from the model given by equation (1), i.e.,
Lr =
1
No
No
∑
i=1− log fr(yi),
(2)
Finally, the monitor detects an anomaly if the negative log-
likelihood is larger than an RSSI inspection threshold de-
noted by τr, i.e., Lr > τr. Here, τr is a design parameter in
BlueShield which is further discussed in Section 6.
B BlueShield App
Figure 15: Sample of a notiﬁcation of a spooﬁng attack shown
in BlueShield’s Android app.
We have developed an Android app which communicates
with BlueShield’s monitor through a secure HTTPS connec-
tion. If the user registers to BlueShield’s notiﬁcation service,
the user can receive the notiﬁcation about the spooﬁng attack
with relevant information, such as the targeted BLE device’s
name and MAC address (Figure 15).
C Analysis of INT inspection
Here, by theoretically analyzing the INT inspection from
the perspective of the lower bound of INT, we illustrate that
the INT inspection mechanism encounters negligible false
negative in detecting spooﬁng attacks.
In BlueShield, the lower bound of INT, Tlb, is calculated
such that Tlb ∈ [Tp − ∆, Tp], where Tp is the advertising period

of the device and ∆ = 10ms. In the spooﬁng attack, when
the device and the attacker broadcast advertising packets si-
multaneously, the monitor can observe a spoofed advertising
packet between two consecutive benign advertising packets
(Figure 16). We note that the original INT is divided into two
observed INT values, t1 and t2. This spooﬁng attack can be
detected if at least one of t1 and t2 is smaller than Tlb. Clearly,
when t1 < Tlb, the attack can be detected. When t1 ≥ Tlb, the
INT inspection can miss the attack if t2 ≥ Tlb. Such a false
negative can be produced under the following condition.
Tp ≤ 3∆
t1 + t2 ≤ Tp + ∆
2Tlb ≤ Tp + ∆ (since Tlb ≤ t1 and Tlb ≤ t2)
(since Tp − ∆ ≤ Tlb)
=⇒
=⇒ 2Tp − 2∆ ≤ Tp + ∆
=⇒
The above expression implies that when ∆ = 10 ms, the
attacker can bypass the INT inspection if Tp ≤ 30ms. We
highlight that as per the BLE speciﬁcation (p.1322 in [5]),
Tp ≥ 20ms. In our experiments (Table 2), since the minimum
value of Tp among the nine test devices is 100ms, we do not
observe such a false negative.
However, the packet loss rate in the BLE network might
affect the false negative of the INT inspection in BlueShield.
Speciﬁcally, the INT inspection may fail to detect an anomaly
in the advertising interval when the collector does not receive
the benign advertising packet due to extensive interference,
but it receives the spoofed advertising packet from the attacker.
In this scenario, when the packet loss rate of the benign adver-
tising packet is denoted by ρ, the probability for the attacker
to transmit n spoofed advertising packets without being de-
tected by the INT inspection is ρn. Hence, the resulting FN

value is negligible. For instance, when ρ = 10% (which is the
typical packet loss rate observed in our experimental setup as
shown in Table 6), the probability to transmit n = 6 spoofed
advertising packets (in two advertising events) without being
detected is 0.0001%. We highlight that six is an extremely
small number of packets for the spooﬁng attack to succeed in
a real-world environment.
D Impact of Multiple Device Monitoring
We evaluate the effectiveness of BlueShield in monitoring
multiple BLE devices in terms of two metrics: (1) packet loss
rate deﬁned as the ratio of the number of packets received by
collectors and the number of packets transmitted by the BLE
device, and (2) packet delay deﬁned as the time required by
the monitor to retrieve a packet from a collector and inspect
its features. As can be seen from Table 6, our results indicate
that there is no signiﬁcant difference in the average packet
loss rate (9.42% vs. 10.21%) and the average packet delay
(10.56ms vs. 10.70ms) between monitoring one BLE device
and 9 BLE devices, respectively. Further, recall that in our ex-
periments, BlueShield readily discovered 30 BLE/Bluetooth
equipped devices in our ofﬁce environment. This indicates
that BlueShield can effectively monitor at least 30 BLE de-
vices, which covers most BLE usage scenarios.
