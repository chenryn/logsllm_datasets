User: How do I learn where the source file for a given Python module is installed? Is the method different on Windows than on Linux?
I'm trying to look for the source of the datetime module in particular, but I'm interested in a more general answer as well.
Assistant: Another way to check if you have multiple python versions installed, from the terminal.
$ python3 -m pip show pyperclip
