User: I have a script that checks something on my PC every 5 minutes and I don't want Python to show on my task tray. I use Windows as my operating system.
Is there any way to make Python run in the background and force it to not show in my task tray?
Assistant: Just another option you have:
You can create a shortcut to your Python script, then right-click the shortcut --> Properties --> Shortcut tab
There is a drop-down box under the Run option which lets you run the command minimized.
