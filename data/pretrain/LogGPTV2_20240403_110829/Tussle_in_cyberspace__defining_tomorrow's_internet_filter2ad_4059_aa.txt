Abstract
The architecture of the Internet is based on a number of
principles,
including the self-describing datagram packet,
the end to end arguments, diversity in technology and global
addressing. As the Internet has moved from a research cu-
riosity to a recognized component of mainstream society,
new requirements have emerged that suggest new design
principles, and perhaps suggest that we revisit some old
ones. This paper explores one important reality that sur-
rounds the Internet today: diﬀerent stakeholders that are
part of the Internet milieu have interests that may be ad-
verse to each other, and these parties each vie to favor their
particular interests. We call this process “the tussle”. Our
position is that accommodating this tussle is crucial to the
evolution of the network’s technical architecture. We dis-
cuss some examples of tussle, and oﬀer some technical design
principles that take it into account.

INTRODUCTION
The Internet was created in simpler times.
Its creators
and early users shared a common goal—they wanted to build
a network infrastructure to hook all the computers in the
world together so that as yet unknown applications could
be invented to run there. All the players, whether designers,
users or operators, shared a consistent vision and a common
sense of purpose.
Perhaps the most important consequence of the Internet’s
success is that the common purpose that launched and nur-
tured it no longer prevails. There are, and have been for
some time, important and powerful players that make up
the Internet milieu with interests directly at odds with each
other.
Some examples are very current. Music lovers of a cer-
tain bent want to exchange recordings with each other, but
the rights holders want to stop them. People want to talk
in private, and the government wants to tap their conversa-
tions. Some examples are so obvious that they are almost
overlooked. For the Internet to provide universal intercon-
nection, ISPs must interconnect, but ISPs are sometimes
ﬁerce competitors. It is not at all clear what interests are
being served, to whose advantage, to what degree, when
ISPs negotiate terms of connection. It is not a single happy
family of people dedicated to universal packet carriage.
We suggest that this development imposes new require-
ments on the Internet’s technical architecture. These new
requirements, in turn, motivate new design strategies to ac-
commodate the growing tussle among and between diﬀerent
Internet players. The purpose of this paper is to explore
what these requirements and strategies might be.
We begin by brieﬂy discussing the Internet landscape -
some fundamental diﬀerences between the mechanisms of
engineering and society, and the players that populate our
ﬁeld. We then outline some proposed design principles in-
tended to accommodate within the Internet mechanisms of
society as well as those of engineering. We believe this ac-
commodation is central to designing an Internet that is re-
silient to the challenges of society as well as those of tech-
nology. We conclude by discussing some tussle spaces, ways
in which our principles might guide the technical response
to these spaces, and speciﬁc technical research that may be
of value in accommodating these tussles.
1.1 The natures of engineering and society
Engineers attempt to solve problems by designing mech-
347anisms with predictable consequences. Successful engineer-
ing yields bridges that predictably don’t fall down, planes
that predictably don’t fall out of the sky, and calculators
that give the “right” answer. The essence of engineering is
the development and codiﬁcation of models, techniques and
tools that deliver predictable, desirable behavior.
The technical development of the Internet has followed
this path. As a community, we focus on design princi-
ples that deliver such virtues as robustness, scalability and
manageability in the face of complexity, component failures,
growth, and other challenges. However, as the Internet be-
comes mainstream it inevitably moves from being an engi-
neering curiosity to being a mirror of the societies in which
it operates. The Internet may have been designed by engi-
neers, but its behavior (and its evolution) is by no means
predictable today.
The operation of societies follows a diﬀerent model. His-
torically, the essence of successful societies is the dynamic
management of evolving and conﬂicting interests. Such so-
cieties are structured around ‘controlled tussle’ – regulated
by mechanisms such as laws, judges, societal opinion, shared
values, and the like. Today, this is the way the Internet is
deﬁned—by a series of ongoing tussles. Diﬀerent parties
adapt its mix of mechanisms to try to achieve their conﬂict-
ing goals, and others respond by adapting the mechanisms
to push back. Thus, conservative governments and corpo-
rations put their users behind ﬁrewalls, and the users route
and tunnel around them. ISPs give their users a single IP
address, and users attach a network of computers using ad-
dress translation. There is no “ﬁnal outcome” of these in-
teractions, no stable point, and no acquiescence to a static
architectural model.
The challenge facing Internet research and engineering is
to recognize and leverage this reality – at minimum to ac-
commodate it; if possible, to use it to strengthen the techni-
cal architecture. In other words, the technical architecture
must accommodate the tussles of society, while continuing
to achieve its traditional goals of scalability, reliability, and
evolvability. This expansion of the Internet’s architectural
goals is a diﬃcult, but central technical problem.
1.2 The Internet landscape
Today, there are many parties that are part of the Internet
milieu. These include:
• Users, who want to run applications and interact over
the Internet.
• Commercial ISPs, who sell Internet service with the
goal of proﬁt.
• Private sector network providers who run a part of the
Internet to facilitate their business or other undertak-
ing.
• Governments, who enforce laws, protect consumers,
regulate commerce, and so on.
• Intellectual property rights holders, who want to pro-
tect their materials on the Internet.
• Providers of content and higher level services, oﬀered
in search of proﬁt or as a public service.
There is great diversity within each of these categories:
there are “good users” and spammers, dominant ISPs and
small players, private providers with more or less rigidity
about usage, liberal and conservative governments, and so
on. The resulting tussles span a broad scope: the rights
of the individual vs. the state, the proﬁt seeking of com-
petitors, the resistance to those with malicious intent, those
with secrets vs. those who would reveal them, and those
who seek anonymity vs. those would identify them and hold
them accountable. The list probably mirrors every aspect
of society. For a detailed discussion of these various players
and their impact on the Internet, see [1].
2. PRINCIPLES
The thesis of this paper is that the future of the Inter-
net will increasingly be deﬁned by tussles that arise among
the various parties with divergent interests, and that the
technical architecture of the Internet must respond to this
observation. If this is so, are there principles to guide de-
signers, and mechanisms that we should use in recognition
of this fact?
In this paper we oﬀer some design principles to deal with
tussle. Our highest-level principle is:
• Design for variation in outcome, so that the outcome
can be diﬀerent in diﬀerent places, and the tussle takes
place within the design, not by distorting or violating
it. Do not design so as to dictate the outcome. Rigid
designs will be broken; designs that permit variation
will ﬂex under pressure and survive.
Within this guiding principle, we identify two more speciﬁc
principles:
• Modularize the design along tussle boundaries, so that
one tussle does not spill over and distort unrelated
issues.
• Design for choice, to permit the diﬀerent players to
express their preferences.
2.1 Modularize along tussle boundaries
Systems designers know to break complex systems into
modular parts. Modularity is typically used to manage com-
plexity, allow for independent implementation and compo-
nent reuse, or to meet other technical goals. But “tussle
isolation” is perhaps a new principle.
• Functions that are within a tussle space should be log-
ically separated from functions outside of that space,
even if there is no compelling technical reason to do so.
Doing this allows a tussle to be played out with min-
imal distortion of other aspects of the system’s func-
tion.
The design of the DNS provides an example. The current
design is entangled in debate because DNS names are used
both to name machines and to express trademark. In retro-
spect, one might have predicted that ﬁghts over trademarks
would be a tussle space, and made sure that the names that
expressed trademarks were used for as little else as possible.
In particular, one might imagine separate strategies to deal
with the issues of trademark, naming mailbox services, and
348providing names for machines that are independent of loca-
tion (the original and minimal purpose of the DNS). One
could then try to design these latter mechanisms to try to
duck the issue of trademark.
• Solutions that are less eﬃcient from a technical per-
spective may do a better job of isolating the collateral
damage of tussle.
In contrast, the current trajectory of IP QoS design tries
to isolate tussles. The use of explicit ToS bits to select QoS,
rather than binding this decision to another property such
as a well-known port number, disentangles what application
is running from what service is desired. It can be anticipated
that there will be tussles about what applications a user can
run, and separately tussles about what service qualities can
be provided. The designers felt that it was better to sepa-
rate these ideas. This modularity allows tussles about QoS
to be played out without distortions, such as demands that
encryption be avoided simply to leave well-known port in-
formation visible or the encapsulation of applications inside
other applications simply to receive better service.
2.2 Design for choice
Network protocols are designed so that diﬀerent parties on
the network can communicate with each other, consumers
can make use of the resources of providers, and providers can
interconnect with each other to provide service. It is impor-
tant that protocols be designed in such a way that all the
parties to an interaction have the ability to express prefer-
ence about which other parties they interact with. Protocols
must permit all the parties to express choice.
For example, the design of the mail system allows the user
to select his SMTP server and his POP server. A user can
pick among servers, perhaps to avoid an unreliable one or
pick one with desirable features, such as spam ﬁlters. Users
can select what news server they use, perhaps to prevent
their children from encountering some of the more color-
ful news groups. This sort of choice drives innovation and
product enhancement, and imposes discipline on the mar-
ketplace.
The form that the choice takes for the diﬀerent parties
may be diﬀerent. A user of mail might choose her SMTP
server by conﬁguring a mail-sending program. An ISP might
try to control what SMTP server a customer uses by redi-
recting packets based on the port number.1
Providing this sort of choice has a drawback—it adds to
the complexity of conﬁguring and using a service. For na¨ıve
users, choice may be a burden, not a blessing. To compen-
sate for this complexity, we may see the emergence of third
parties that rate services (the on-line analog of Consumers
Reports) and parties that provide pre-conﬁgured software
to relieve the user of dealing with the details of choice.
2.3
Implications
These principles, and the reality of tussle, have some fur-
ther implications for design:
1An over-generalization of the tussle is that service providers
exercise control over routing; end-users control selection of
other end-points. End-users try to over-rule constrained
routing with tunnels and overlay networks.
Choice often requires open interfaces. Open inter-
faces have played a critical role in the evolution of the In-
