## Abstract
The architecture of the Internet is based on several key principles, including self-describing datagram packets, end-to-end arguments, technological diversity, and global addressing. As the Internet has evolved from a research curiosity to a fundamental part of mainstream society, new requirements have emerged, suggesting the need for new design principles and a reevaluation of existing ones. This paper explores the reality that different stakeholders in the Internet ecosystem often have conflicting interests, leading to a "tussle" for control and influence. We argue that accommodating this tussle is crucial for the evolution of the network's technical architecture. We provide examples of such tussles and propose technical design principles that take these conflicts into account.

## 1. Introduction
The Internet was created in simpler times, with a shared goal among its creators and early users: to build a network infrastructure that would connect all the world's computers, enabling the development of yet-unknown applications. All stakeholders, whether designers, users, or operators, shared a common vision and purpose.

However, the Internet's success has led to a more complex landscape where different stakeholders have conflicting interests. For example, music lovers may want to share recordings, while rights holders seek to prevent it. Users desire privacy, but governments may want to monitor communications. ISPs must interconnect to provide universal service, but they are also fierce competitors, making it unclear whose interests are served when they negotiate connection terms.

We suggest that these developments impose new requirements on the Internet's technical architecture. These new requirements, in turn, necessitate new design strategies to accommodate the growing tussle among different Internet players. This paper aims to explore these requirements and strategies.

### 1.1 The Natures of Engineering and Society
Engineers aim to solve problems by designing mechanisms with predictable outcomes. Successful engineering ensures that bridges do not collapse, planes do not fall from the sky, and calculators give the correct answers. The essence of engineering is the development and codification of models, techniques, and tools that deliver predictable, desirable behavior.

The technical development of the Internet has followed this path, focusing on design principles that ensure robustness, scalability, and manageability. However, as the Internet becomes a mainstream component of society, its behavior and evolution are no longer predictable. Societies, unlike engineered systems, are characterized by the dynamic management of evolving and conflicting interests. They are structured around "controlled tussle," regulated by laws, societal opinions, and shared values.

Today, the Internet is defined by ongoing tussles. Different parties adapt the Internet's mechanisms to achieve their conflicting goals, and others respond by adapting the mechanisms to push back. For example, conservative governments and corporations place users behind firewalls, and users route and tunnel around them. ISPs provide single IP addresses, and users use address translation to attach multiple computers. There is no final outcome or stable point in these interactions.

The challenge for Internet research and engineering is to recognize and leverage this reality, at minimum to accommodate it, and if possible, to use it to strengthen the technical architecture. The technical architecture must accommodate the tussles of society while continuing to achieve traditional goals of scalability, reliability, and evolvability.

### 1.2 The Internet Landscape
Today, the Internet involves many diverse stakeholders:
- **Users:** Who want to run applications and interact over the Internet.
- **Commercial ISPs:** Who sell Internet services for profit.
- **Private Sector Network Providers:** Who run parts of the Internet to facilitate their business or other undertakings.
- **Governments:** Who enforce laws, protect consumers, and regulate commerce.
- **Intellectual Property Rights Holders:** Who want to protect their materials on the Internet.
- **Content and Service Providers:** Who offer content and higher-level services for profit or as a public service.

There is great diversity within each category, leading to a broad range of tussles, such as individual rights versus state control, profit-seeking competitors, resistance to malicious actors, and the balance between anonymity and accountability. For a detailed discussion, see [1].

## 2. Principles
The thesis of this paper is that the future of the Internet will be increasingly defined by tussles among various parties with divergent interests. The technical architecture of the Internet must respond to this observation. We propose some design principles to deal with tussle:

### 2.1 Design for Variation in Outcome
Design for variation in outcome so that the outcome can differ in different places, and the tussle takes place within the design, not by distorting or violating it. Rigid designs will be broken; designs that permit variation will flex under pressure and survive.

### 2.2 Modularize Along Tussle Boundaries
Modularize the design along tussle boundaries to prevent one tussle from spilling over and distorting unrelated issues. Functions within a tussle space should be logically separated from functions outside that space, even if there is no compelling technical reason to do so. This allows a tussle to be played out with minimal distortion of other aspects of the system's function.

For example, the current DNS design is entangled in debates because DNS names are used for both machine naming and trademark expression. A better approach might have been to separate these functions, allowing for independent handling of trademarks, mailbox services, and machine naming.

### 2.3 Design for Choice
Network protocols should be designed to allow different parties to express preferences about which other parties they interact with. This drives innovation and imposes discipline on the marketplace. For instance, email users can choose their SMTP and POP servers, and news users can select their news servers. This choice can add complexity, but third-party services like online ratings and pre-configured software can help mitigate this.

### 2.4 Implications
These principles and the reality of tussle have further implications for design:
- **Open Interfaces:** Open interfaces play a critical role in the evolution of the Internet. They allow for choice and flexibility, which are essential in managing tussles.
- **Control and Routing:** Service providers often exercise control over routing, while end-users control the selection of other endpoints. End-users may try to override constrained routing with tunnels and overlay networks.

By incorporating these principles, we can design an Internet that is resilient to the challenges of both technology and society.
