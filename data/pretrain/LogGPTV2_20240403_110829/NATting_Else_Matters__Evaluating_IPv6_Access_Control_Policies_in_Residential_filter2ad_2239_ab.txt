NATting Else Matters: Evaluating IPv6 Access Control Policies
381
4 Results
In this section, we present the results of our experiments for each of the CE
routers. In general, we ﬁnd CE routers with IPv6 capability have little common-
ality of security implementation across manufacturers.
4.1 Operational Defaults
Table 1 presents an overview of our ﬁndings showing a wide variance in default
operation, security, and user control. Eight of the ten routers assessed have an
enabled default ﬁrewall policy (i.e., default-deny) for IPv6 while the remaining
two devices (TP-Link AC1750 and Motorola MR26001) do not have a default
ﬁrewall (i.e., default-permit). Neither of these two devices communicates this
design decision to the consumer. At the time of writing, the TP-Link AC1750
is Amazon US’s top-selling router [1] and TP-link is the top global provider,
accounting for 15.9% of all deployed devices [10], suggesting that the default
permit model may be commonly deployed.
Five of these eight default deny devices further provide a “One-Click Open”
option for opening the network to inbound connections. This option immediately
transitions the network to a default permit model allowing all ingress traﬃc
through to the internal hosts. The eﬀect that this has on ingress ﬁltering can be
seen in Fig. 3 in the Appendix. Only one of the ten devices evaluated provides
an explicit warning to the user before allowing the ﬁrewall to be disabled using
this feature. Users with minimal technical knowledge who are accustomed to a
default closed model from IPv4 NAT may be unaware of the additional exposure
this option creates.
Two routers, the Motorola MR2600 and TP-Link AC1750, enable IPv6 rout-
ing by default with a default permit ﬁrewall. This combination of conﬁguration
settings exposes all IPv6-capable devices to the wider Internet by default. While
the Motorola MR2600 allows consumers to optionally enable the ﬁrewall, the
user must be aware of the current state and possess the technical capability to
do so. Worse, the TP-Link router only provides the ability to disable IPv6 and
has no capability to enable any ﬁltering.
4.2 Firewall Policies and Pinholing
We ﬁnd a spectrum of ﬁrewall management options oﬀered to the consumers
ranging from subscription model services for packet inspection and ﬁltering,
to singular on/oﬀ toggles, to complete lack of ﬁrewall conﬁguration for IPv6.
Depending on the router, modifying the conﬁguration can be accomplished
through a smartphone application or a locally hosted web portal, with a few
devices supporting both.
1 Responsible Disclosure Given the severity of enabling IPv6 support by default and
a default-permit posture, we disclosed our ﬁndings to both Motorola and TP-Link
in August 2020. In November 2020, Motorola issued a public patch to correct the
issue. TP-Link did not respond to our disclosure.

K. Olson et al.
For routers that provide an interface to create exceptions to the default
ﬁrewall ﬁltering policy (pinholes), we found that two out of six connect those
rules to the device MAC address. We veriﬁed that in these cases, traﬃc destined
for any associated address for the device is forwarded. The other four out of six
routers allow users to provide a single, static address that the rule applies to;
the rules are not updated if the device migrates or is assigned additional IPv6
addresses over time.
Of the routers that do not support IPv6 pinholing, only the TP-Link AC1750
provides no ability to conﬁgure the ﬁrewall aside from disabling IPv6 (because it
does not have such a ﬁrewall). For the remaining three routers, Cisco DPC3941T
XB3 also provides several options of choosing what kind of traﬃc is blocked
besides the “One-Click Open” option, while for Ubiquiti AmpliFi and Netgear
Nighthawk, One-Click Open is the only method available for users to control
the ﬁrewall. As an example, the Ubiquiti AmpliFi provides users with minimal
control over IPv4 policies through port-forwarding controls, but the management
interface lacks an equivalent ability to create pinholes in IPv6. Ubiquiti notes this
on their oﬃcial FAQ: “AmpliFi does not support editing ﬁrewall conﬁgurations,
and cannot be disabled unless you place the router in bridge mode” [15]. Contrary
to this statement, they do allow automated modiﬁcation of ﬁrewall rules through
the embedded UPnP WANIPv6FirewallControl:1 device template. For manual
control, the web interface instead oﬀers an “Allow all incoming IPv6 connections”
as the only actionable solution for non-technical users.
4.3 Router Scanning
We ﬁnd that when CE routers are globally accessible a majority of them expose
open services to the Internet as shown by Table 2. Whether the ﬁrewalls are
disabled manually or by default, six routers do not employ rules to restrict
access to local network services from the global Internet. We found that services
(e.g., SMTP, HTTP, and SMB) available on internal router interfaces were also
oﬀered on the external interfaces as well as the link local address on these devices.
Interestingly, this indicates that the manufacturers are conﬁguring their internal
services to listen on all interfaces; when the ﬁrewall is oﬀ, these services are no
