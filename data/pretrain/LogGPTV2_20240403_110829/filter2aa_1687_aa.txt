## Introduction
Frontrunners exploit non-public information to register domain names for profit. This advisory examines the opportunity for a party with insider information to track an Internet user’s preference for registering a domain name and preemptively register that name. The Security and Stability Advisory Committee (SSAC) of ICANN likens this activity to front running in stock and commodities markets and calls it "domain name front running." In the domain name industry, insider information would be gathered from monitoring one or more attempts by an Internet user to check the availability of a domain name.

## Classic "Add Grace Period" Frontrunning
ICANN policy changes terminated classic "Add Grace Period" (AGP) frontrunning. In response to community concerns about the excessive use and abuse of the five-day AGP, ICANN implemented two measures that resulted in a 99.7% decrease in AGP deletes from June 2008 to April 2009. These measures made domain tasting increasingly expensive, as companies were charged for each additional registration above a certain number or percentage of domains each month.

Domain tasting had several negative consequences, including making it difficult for individuals to reclaim lapsed domain names and leading to a proliferation of websites featuring nothing but advertisements, thus degrading the overall quality of the Internet.

## DNS Query Failure Traffic as a New Potential Source of "Insider Information"
We hypothesize that recursive DNS traffic collected from caching recursive resolvers can potentially drive and/or expose speculative domain registration efforts. While DNS instrumentation typically focuses on domains that do resolve, professional domainers need information about domain names that people attempt to access but are not registered. 

### Why Do Domainers Need Data?
Professional domainers, working at scale, tend to be data-driven. They:
- Identify domains based on empirical data sources, not just hunches.
- Programmatically register those names.
- Register a significant volume of domains on an ongoing basis.

In contrast, small-scale amateur domainers may register a few domain names ad hoc, which is not a significant concern.

### Passive DNS Data and DNS Failures
Passive DNS data focuses on successful DNS queries, but we also have data on DNS failures. Information about domain names that people cannot resolve (such as NXDOMAINs) would be valuable for domainers. However, Farsight does not provide or sell this data because domainers increase costs for legitimate users, complicate life for search engines, and decrease the overall signal-to-noise ratio on the Internet.

### Two Behaviors We Expect to See
1. **Volumetrically-driven typosquatting**: Domainers may watch DNS query/response traffic, tally the volume of NXDOMAINs seen by domain, and register the highest volume domains for use in conjunction with online advertising programs.
2. **Programmatic exploration of domain permutations around high-value existing brands**: This involves reconnoitering via DNS queries, similar to "recon by fire" in the Vietnam War era. Domainers may seek available domains that brand owners might buy for brand protection or use in phishing campaigns or spamming knock-off products.

## Data from the Security Information Exchange (SIE)
Farsight Security operates the Security Information Exchange (SIE), a set of physical locations where real-time streaming DNS data and other security-relevant data are distributed. SIE channels include:

### Channel 221: NXDOMAIN Data
- **Volume**: 15K observations per second (12-13 Mbps), 1.3 billion observations/day.
- **Important Note**: An NXDOMAIN for a (FQDN/RecType at time/date) does not imply that the underlying effective 2nd-level domain doesn't exist. NXDOMAINs include junk, such as DNSBL traffic, missing in-addr.arpa, and illegal/impossible domains.

### Channel 212: Newly Observed Base Domains (NOD) Data
- **Volume**: Roughly three observations per second, ~259,200 observations/day.
- **Data**: Second-level effective domains (e.g., example.com, not www.example.com).
- **Clean Stream**: NOD data is incorporated into DNSDB.

### Sample Observations
- **Channel 221**: Example observation of an NXDOMAIN.
- **Channel 212**: Example observation of a newly observed domain.

### Processing the NXDOMAINs
- **Total Observations**: ~4.5 billion for Channel 221.
- **Reduction**: To reduce the number of NXDOMAINs, we can drop domains with bad characters, invalid formats, and invalid TLDs. Duplicates and repetitive hits throughout the hour are also removed.
- **Validation**: Ensure that the discovered effective 2nd-level domains can be registered.

### Findings
- **Scope Reduction**: We processed an hour's worth of NXDOMAIN data, reducing 50,233,247 observations to 1,662,832 domains.
- **Matching NXD Domains Against NOD Data**: We found 181 NXDOMAIN domains from Channel 221 subsequently registered/used in NOD (Channel 212).

### Conclusion
The culling process was effective but slow, taking nearly four days of processing time for one hour's worth of data. The low number of matches may indicate that people are not culling names to register from NXDOMAINs, or that the phenomena are not visible within the first few days.
