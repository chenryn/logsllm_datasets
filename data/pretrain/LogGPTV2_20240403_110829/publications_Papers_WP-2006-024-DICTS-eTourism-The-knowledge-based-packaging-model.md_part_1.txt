## Abstract
The rapid growth of the Internet and the continuous adoption of innovative technology have significantly transformed the travel industry over the past decade. In response to the dynamic business environment, one of the latest concepts in the tourism industry is "Dynamic Packaging." While Dynamic Packaging has been widely accepted by customers, its strategic implications are still uncertain. This paper presents an extension of the traditional packaging architecture and introduces a new model called the Knowledge-based Dynamic Packaging Model.

## 1. Introduction
Tourism is one of the most promising sectors of the global economy. The World Tourism Organization predicts a 200% increase in tourist arrivals worldwide by 2020, with consumers expected to take an average of four holidays per year [1]. This growth is driven by factors such as increased leisure time, social importance, and global economic expansion.

According to Carl H. Marcussen from the Centre for Regional and Tourism Research of Denmark, the European online travel market size has grown from 2.5 billion Euros in 2000 to 18.2 billion Euros in 2004, with further growth to 28.5 billion Euros expected by 2006 [2]. Despite this growth, the e-Tourism market remains opaque due to the difficulty in comparing available distribution channels [5].

The tourism industry's transformation is linked to the adoption of innovative technology and the increasing number of consumers with access to the necessary hardware, software, and internet connections. Unlike in the early days of online travel, suppliers now aim to regain control of their inventory and improve direct sales through their own websites. For example, British Airways reports that 42% of their bookings are made via BA.com, while Aer Lingus claims nearly 70% [3].

## 2. Defining Dynamic Packaging
Dynamic Packaging is a term used in various contexts. It can be seen as both a technology and an overall merchandising solution [6]. According to [7], Dynamic Packaging enables consumers or booking agents to build customized itineraries by assembling multiple components and completing the transaction in real-time. Ref. [8] adds that Dynamic Packaging should provide a single, fully priced package (hiding the price of individual components) within 5-15 seconds.

Fitzgerald [6] identifies that a key requirement for Dynamic Packaging is the existence of an infrastructure to integrate data in an automated way, allowing uniform querying across multiple heterogeneous systems. However, the main point of differentiation between dynamic and traditional vacation packages is the ability for the consumer to dynamically access data stored in several separate inventory management systems [9].

For our purposes, Dynamic Packaging is based on an individual consumer request, combining multiple travel components (flights, hotels, car rentals, etc.) in real-time and providing a single, fully priced package with one payment, while hiding the pricing of individual components.

## 3. Extended Packaging Architecture
### A. Data Integration Layer
A modern Dynamic Packaging solution should be able to access product information stored in local databases and external inventories with real-time access or supported by cache mechanisms. Relying solely on local databases limits the range of products offered. Major online travel agencies and some airlines extend their databases by combining their own inventory with real-time access to external inventory.

Cooperating with a critical mass of suppliers from various travel industries is essential for providing customized travel products. Establishing linkages to diverse numbers of suppliers, including Computerized Reservation Systems (CRS), Global Distribution Systems (GDS), Hotel Distribution Systems (HDS), and Destination Management Systems (DMS), is crucial for real-time access to up-to-date information.

### B. Packaging Layer
The packaging layer, the second layer of our extended architecture, is composed of four packaging models:
1. **Prepackaging Model**: Static packages with limited flexibility, offering one fixed option.
2. **Predesigned Package Model**: Enhanced prepackaging with more choice options.
3. **Component Packaging Model**: Offers total flexibility, where the travel agent purchases any wanted component from different suppliers.
4. **Dynamic Packaging Model**: Combines all travel components at the request of an individual customer, sold as one trip with one price, and allows real-time booking and confirmation.

### C. Presentation Layer
The presentation layer is crucial for the success of the package solution. Similar to any business, presenting the product in a convenient and attractive manner is essential. On-line multimedia content, supported by various sources, replaces traditional destination brochures. Major companies are making significant efforts to enhance their presentation layers, but many small and medium-sized companies still lack proper presentation.

## 4. Knowledge-based Dynamic Packaging Model
Recent developments in Dynamic Packaging technology enable the creation of a new breed of solutions. We present a new packaging model (Fig. 3) based on input from consumer experiences/reviews and individual user profiles gathered through social networks and personalized user accounts. This model aims to create tailor-made packages with maximum customization, integrating destination information, social networks, and public websites.

### A. Knowledge-based Packaging Process
Customization of travel products and services is a primary objective of Dynamic Packaging systems. Knowledge-based packaging should scale down the vast quantity of choices to present only what the customer is looking for, avoiding information overload. This includes assembling customized travel packages and individual pricing based on customer preferences. Gathering and evaluating data on customer background and preferences is vital for tailoring individualized products.

### B. Dynamic Package Wrapping
Tourism and travel products are "confidence goods" because they cannot generally be tested before purchase. To turn lookers into bookers, Dynamic Packaging solutions should integrate systems to disseminate comprehensive information about destinations and local tourism products. Customers should have access to information in various digital formats, such as textual descriptions, interactive maps, photographs, 360-degree views, webcams, and videos. Destination Management Systems (DMS) play a crucial role in electronic marketing and destination management. Integrating information from these systems and smaller supplier websites is a significant challenge, as automatic retrieval of information from HTML is highly complex.

## Conclusion
The Knowledge-based Dynamic Packaging Model aims to meet the needs of the present and future customers more efficiently. By leveraging consumer experiences, individual user profiles, and advanced data integration, this model offers a higher degree of customization and flexibility, enhancing the overall travel experience.
