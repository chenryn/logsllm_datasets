### Measurement Artifacts in NetFlow Data

#### Introduction
The number of incorrectly counted bytes is approximately 0.2% of the total number of bytes in both cases. Consequently, the impact of this artifact on accounting applications is minimal.

#### Non-TCP Flow Records with TCP ACK Flag Set
Our analysis has revealed that only flow data from older Cisco devices (i.e., Exporter 1, 2, and 4) exhibit this artifact. On average, non-TCP flow records with the TCP ACK flag set account for about 1% of the total number of flow records on Exporter 1 and 2.

If analysis applications do not use properly defined filters on flow data containing this artifact, it can lead to unexpected results and misconceptions. For example, a filter for flow records with the TCP ACK flag set may inadvertently include UDP flows when using data from Exporter 1, 2, and 4. Popular analysis tools like nfdump accept these filters without issuing any warnings to the user. However, if the transport-layer protocol is specified in the filter along with the flags, this artifact will not affect the semantic integrity of the data analysis.

#### Gaps in Flow Data
In this section, we characterize the effects of flow learn failures on flow data. This helps to determine whether this artifact is also present in data from other exporters, even without access to flow cache statistics. Our experiments have shown that the first packets of flows are more likely to be affected by flow learn failures because subsequent packets of accounted flows are matched until the records expire. Smaller flows are, therefore, more likely to be unaccounted for, while larger flows may only lose their initial packets.

Figure 2a shows a time-series of the number of flow records in 100ms intervals. This data was collected early in the morning when Exporter 1 typically starts to run out of capacity. A continuous stream of flow records can be observed until around 7:25, when the number of records increases. Simultaneously, flow learn failures (in packets/s) start to be reported by SNMP agents, and several short gaps appear in the time-series. Note that the series are slightly out of phase due to the higher aggregation of the SNMP measurements.

Interestingly, the gaps caused by flow learn failures are periodic, especially when the network load is consistently above the exporter's capacity. Analyzing data from Exporter 1 over two weeks, we observed that the distribution of the time between gaps is concentrated around multiples of 4 seconds. Furthermore, gaps are no longer than 2 seconds in 95% of the cases, confirming our assumption about a cyclic process for expiring records from the flow cache.

Gaps can also be caused by other factors, such as the loss of NetFlow packets during their transport from exporters to collectors or packet loss on the monitored link. Both are typically random events that result in either a homogeneous reduction in the number of flow records or non-periodic gaps. Figure 2b illustrates an example of NetFlow packet loss by showing the time-series of flow records observed at a highly overloaded collector. Analysis of NetFlow packet sequence numbers confirms that more than 5% of the NetFlow packets were lost by the collector during this interval. Several short periods with a reduced number of flow records can be observed, but the series never reaches zero in this example. This demonstrates that gaps in flow data cannot be definitively attributed to flow learn failures.

We confirmed the existence of gaps in flow data from Exporter 1 and 2. Exporters 3-5 could not be tested, either because they are in production networks or because we were unable to exhaust their flow capacity. Exporter 6 handles collisions in software using linked lists and is, therefore, not subject to flow learn failures. Under extreme load, it exports flow records earlier, ignoring timeout parameters completely.

Although this artifact has a severe impact on any analysis due to the resulting incomplete data set, we discuss two examples: anomaly detection and bandwidth estimation. Anomaly detection, particularly for flooding attacks, often relies on large sets of small flows. Since the first packets of a flow are especially susceptible to flow learn failures, they are more likely to be lost during the flow export process. Anomalies can, therefore, remain undetected. Additionally, peaks in network traffic may be smoothed due to the load-dependency of the artifact, which is crucial for bandwidth estimation. As a result, traffic analysis may provide invalid estimates.

#### Conclusions
In this paper, we identified, analyzed, and quantified several artifacts occurring in flow data exported by six different devices. These artifacts are related to how these devices handle flow expiration, TCP flags, and byte counters, as well as imprecisions in the number of exported flow records.

Our analysis shows that the impact of the identified artifacts on the quality of flow data varies, and in some cases, mitigation and recovery procedures can be considered. For example, non-TCP flow records with the TCP ACK flag set can be easily repaired. The imprecise flow record expiration artifact can often be ignored if the flow collector aggregates records belonging to the same flow before analysis. However, the remaining artifacts cannot be easily mitigated and adversely affect the quality of the exported flow data.

The severity of the identified artifacts ultimately depends on their impact on the applications using the data. Analysis applications are generally designed to be generic and applicable to any flow data. However, our experience suggests that a better approach to designing flow-based applications would be to consider data artifacts. Since the types of artifacts differ from exporter to exporter, researchers and operators need to be aware of these artifacts to build more robust analysis applications.

One area that remains unexplored in this work is the influence of packet sampling on flow data artifacts, which we plan to address in future work. Additionally, we plan to develop a data cleanup tool aimed at detecting and repairing artifacts in flow data.
