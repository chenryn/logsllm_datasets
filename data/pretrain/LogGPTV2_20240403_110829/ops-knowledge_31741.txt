User: I know this question has been asked a few times before, but none of the answers I've read have managed to solve my problem.
When I try to run any of the following, I get an error saying "pip.exe has stopped working:

easy_install
pip
pip3

It was working for me previously (the last time I used it was probably a month ago), but not anymore. I'm using Python 3.4.4, I checked the PATH and it's configured correctly. Does anyone know what else might be causing the issue?
Assistant: I had the same problem before and the solution is quite simple.
First try updating pip via command: 
pip install --upgrade pip
If that doesn't work try uninstalling current version of python and reinstalling the newest version.
Note1: Do not just delete install files and files in your C drive ,uninstall everything packages, everything that might cause problems, especially delete old python packages and extensions they might not work with the newest python version and that might be the problem. You can see in python website which packages and extensions are supported.
Note2: Do not and I repeat DO NOT install .msi or .exe extensions they don't work anymore always use .whl (wheel) files. If you have one .msi or .exe uninstall them form your system completely; that also means that you have to uninstall them from command prompt.
Note3: Always check if the .whl is compatible with your Python version.
Note4: Also don't forget to save your projects before doing anything.
Hope that works :D
Happy Coding.
