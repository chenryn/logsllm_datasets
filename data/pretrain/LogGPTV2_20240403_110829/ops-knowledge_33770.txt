User: I have a python gui that access files on windows as C:\data and C:\MyDIR all outside my doc's.
On, a linux sys i created /data and /MyDIR.
My gui cant access. I foresee always using C:\data and C:\MyDIR on both systems.  
How do I fix code or Linux permissions to have access to both dir and sub directories.
Assistant: The linux filesystem uses / as root. You can't use \data and \MyDir because \ does not mean anything. Moreover, the default owner of / is the user named root. Commonly you work with a different user than root on the machine.
So by default, you don't have the permission to write or to create something in / .
Choose another directory in your home directory. For example :
~/data/ & ~/MyDir/
~/ equals to /home/user428862/ where user428862 is your username on the machine.
