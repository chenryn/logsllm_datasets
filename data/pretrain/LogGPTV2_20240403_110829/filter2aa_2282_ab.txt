  from	
  the

  Advertisers

  have	
  been	
  using	
  NFC	
  in	
  toys	
  and	
  smart

  to	
provide	
  a	
  more	
  meaningful	
  interactive

  We	
  are	
  also	
  now	
  seeing	
  perhaps	
  the	
  first	
  use	
  of	
  NFC	
as	
  a	
  protection

  in	
  consumer

RFID

  potential	
  to	
  make

  lives	
  easier	
  with	
  contactless	
  payment,

  and	
  seemingly	
  secure

  but	
  the	
  reality	
  is	
  that	
  much	
  of	
  this	
  technology	
  has	
  been	
implemented	
  insecurely	
  because	
  there	
  is	
  a	
  general	
  lack	
  of	
  knowledge	
  on	
  how	
  to	
  evaluate	
  these

Cards	
  using

  chipset	
  are	
  collectively	
  referred

  With	
seven	
  32-­‐bit

  can	
  be	
  configured	
  to

  of	
  low-­‐frequency

  Modulation

  frequency-­‐shift	
keying	
  (FSK),

making

  real	
  threat	
  to	
  businesses	
  relying	
  on	
  these	
  cards	
  alone	
  for	
  access

  With	
  the	
help	
  of	
  a	
  few	
  simple	
  proxmark3	
  commands,	
  it	
  is	
  possible	
  to	
  easily	
  convert	
  any

  tag	
  into	
  a	
  T55x7

Low-­‐frequency

  can	
  of	
  course	
  also	
  be	
  emulated	
  in-­‐circuit	
  by	
  simply	
  crafting	
  the	
  expected

and	
  presenting	
  it

  These

High

  Cloning	
So	
  called	
  “magic”	
  are	
  well	
  known	
  in	
  the	
  industry	
  because	
  they	
  allow	
  the	
  end	
  user	
  to	
  reprogram	
  the	
normally	
  write-­‐only	
  block	
  0	
  values	
  containing	
  most	
  importantly	
  the	
  card’s	
  unique	
  identifier	
  (UID).	
  Along	
with	
  well-­‐documented	
  cracks	
  against	
  the	
  MiFare	
  Classic	
  encryption	
  scheme,	
  this	
  allows	
  an	
  attacker	
  to	
make	
  a	
  complete	
  duplicate	
  MiFare	
  Classic	
  card	
  in	
  potentially	
  under	
  a	
  minute	
  even	
  when	
  encryption	
  is	
used.	
  Also	
  referred	
  to	
  as	
  “changeable	
  uid”	
  or	
  “Chinese”,	
  these	
  cards	
  are	
  available	
  for	
  a	
  variety	
  of	
  shapes	
sizes	
  and	
  formats	
  with	
  some	
  companies	
  such	
  as	
  Clone	
  My	
  Key3	
  offering	
  full	
  duplication	
  service.	
Another	
  approach	
  comes	
  from	
  hardware	
  devices	
  designed	
  to	
  simulate	
  the	
  waveform	
  and	
  even	
  responses	
from	
  ISO14443a	
  compliant	
  readers.	
  One	
  of	
  the	
  most	
  interesting	
  techniques	
  however	
  has	
  to	
  be	
  the	
  use	
  of	
a	
  Chameleon	
  circuit.	
  Designed	
  at	
  Ruhr	
  University	
  Bochum,	
  this	
  circuit	
  is	
  designed	
  to	
  store	
  and	
  emulate	
multiple	
  NFC	
  tags	
  with	
  various	
  data	
  sets	
  as	
  well	
  as	
  snooping	
  on	
  NFC	
  communication	
  to	
  potentially	
uncover	
  UIDs	
  or	
  other	
  sensitive	
  data.	
  Among	
  other	
  things,	
  this	
  device	
  was	
  used	
  to	
  highlight	
  fundamental	
flaws	
  in	
  the	
  Akademisches
