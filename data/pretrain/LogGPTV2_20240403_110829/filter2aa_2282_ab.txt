### Controlling Damping Factor with Coil Opening and Closing

A mechanism similar to opening and closing the circuit with the coil can be used to control the damping factor. This, in turn, determines the degree to which the coil resonates from the reader. The reader detects this as a changing voltage and interprets the signal based on the modulation and/or encoding for that specific protocol. ISO14443a/NFC systems employ a similar method but with a more extensive command set, providing access to more data and occasional encryption options.

RFID tags are widely used in various applications, from common office access control systems to passports and mobile payment systems. Advertisers and game designers have also integrated NFC into toys and smart posters to create more interactive experiences. Recently, NFC has been employed as a protection mechanism in consumer products, such as Keurig 2.0 coffee makers, which use an NFC tag to differentiate between sanctioned and unsanctioned coffee grinds.

### How to Train Your RFID Hacking Tools

RFID tags have the potential to make our lives easier with contactless payments, automatic device configuration, and seemingly secure locks. However, much of this technology has been implemented insecurely due to a general lack of knowledge on how to evaluate these systems.

#### Low-Frequency Cloning (T55x7)

Cards using the Atmel T5557 and ATA5567 chipsets are collectively referred to as T55x7 cards. These cards feature seven 32-bit, optionally password-protected EEPROMs, allowing them to emulate a wide range of low-frequency tags. The supported modulation and encoding methods include frequency-shift keying (FSK), phase-shift keying (PSK), Manchester encoding, Biphase encoding, and non-return to zero (NRZ) encoding. Each EEPROM, or block, can be configured for different purposes. Block 0 is used to configure modulation and data rate options, while blocks 1-7 can supply up to 224 bits of raw data for transmission.

T55x7 cards can simulate popular formats such as HID, Indala, EM410x, and AWID, making them a significant threat to businesses relying on these cards for access control. With the help of a few simple Proxmark3 commands, it is possible to easily convert any supported tag into a T55x7 clone.

**Figure 2: T5557 Construction (via proxclone.com)**

The block 0 configuration of a T55x7 controller varies slightly, but the common T5557 configuration can be found in the Atmel datasheet.

Low-frequency cards can also be emulated in-circuit by crafting the expected waveform and presenting it to the card reader. These techniques will be covered in later sections.

#### High-Frequency Cloning

So-called "magic" cards are well-known in the industry because they allow the end user to reprogram the normally write-only block 0 values, which contain the card's unique identifier (UID). Along with well-documented cracks against the MiFare Classic encryption scheme, this enables an attacker to create a complete duplicate MiFare Classic card in potentially under a minute, even when encryption is used. Also referred to as "changeable UID" or "Chinese" cards, these are available in various shapes, sizes, and formats. Some companies, such as Clone My Key, offer full duplication services.

Another approach involves hardware devices designed to simulate the waveform and responses from ISO14443a compliant readers. One of the most interesting techniques is the use of a Chameleon circuit. Developed at Ruhr University Bochum, this circuit is designed to store and emulate multiple NFC tags with various data sets and snoop on NFC communication to potentially uncover UIDs or other sensitive data. This device was used to highlight fundamental flaws in the Akademisches Förderungswerk (AKAFÖ) contactless payment system commonly used in German universities.

### Introducing the Proxmark3 (pm3)

The Proxmark3, developed by Koning Gans, was initially created to analyze the security of local transit cards. The idea is to use a less expensive FPGA to perform high-quality software-defined radio (SDR) paired with an ARM processor capable of performing encoding operations and moderating instructions from the user. The project is a completely open-source (hardware and software) initiative for affordable RFID research on both high-frequency and low-frequency target systems.

The Proxmark3 can interact with or simulate a wide range of RFID tags, with additional support added through community-maintained firmware. An assembled board can currently be purchased for $229 without antennae or an enclosure. Tuning commands within the ARM operating system assist in constructing high-quality coils at a minimal cost.

**Proxmark3’s FPGA**

At the core of the Proxmark3 is a Xilinx Spartan-II FPGA driven by code authored in Verilog and compiled with the ISE WebPACK. A modular design allows for different discrete functionality blocks, which can be switched by simply redirecting pin connections on the fly. The FPGA defines a serial peripheral interface (SPI) for communication with the ARM processor.
