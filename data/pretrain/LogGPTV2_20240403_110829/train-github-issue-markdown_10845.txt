# Description
The RabbitMQ setting task_queue_ha_policy no longer has any affect, as
described in the release notes for version 3.
This was reported to the mailing list here (in 2013!) and the answer then was
that it's deprecated and will be removed.
# Suggestions
Remove the configuration parameter and maybe reference the blog post and/or
docs on how to set a policy.
