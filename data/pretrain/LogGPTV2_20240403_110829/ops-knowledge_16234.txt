User: I have a shell script which launches many different python scripts.
The shell script exports many variables, which are in turn used by the python scripts.
This is working perfectly when run in command line, but it does not work when executed in crontab.
In the cron logs, I could see the shell script working, but the python script does not seem to run.

Will the python scripts be able to run from the shell script in cron?
Will the python scripts be able to access the env variables set by the parent shell script from cron?
Assistant: If you're having problems it's a good idea to use full qualified paths to commands in any script that's being called from cron, so as to avoid PATH and environment variable issues with the bare-bones environment that cron is called in.
