User: You need to remotely log in to a Linux server, how to perform security authentication and connect to the server?
Assistant: To remotely log in to a Linux server and perform security authentication, the following steps need to be followed: 1. Determine the IP address and port number of the target server. The default SSH port is 22, but the port may be changed to something else for added security. 2. Open a terminal (or command line interface) and enter the following command: ssh username@IP address -p port number where username is your username on the server, IP address is the IP address of the server, and port number is the SSH on the server The port number of the server (if changed). 3. Enter your password for authentication. If you do not have a password set, you may need to use an SSH key file for authentication. This can be done by setting up an SSH key pair on the server. 4. Once connected to the server, you will see the server's command line interface. You can enter commands here to operate the server as if you were operating the command line on your local computer. Note: When logging into the server remotely, make sure your connection is secure. Encryption techniques such as SSH can be used to secure connections and prevent unauthorized access. In addition, in order to prevent passwords from being guessed or stolen by attackers, it is recommended to use complex passwords and change them frequently.
