Question: A web application developer believes that by using the HTML `<script>` tag, they can avoid the restrictions imposed by the same-origin policy and freely access data from any origin without security repercussions. As a security expert, what would you argue to correct this misconception?
"A": "The same-origin policy does not apply to `<script>` tags, which means any external scripts included are executed within the same context as the site, potentially leading to sensitive data leakage.",
"B": "The same-origin policy ensures absolute data isolation between different origins, meaning `<script>` tags cannot be used to include any cross-origin resources.",
"C": "The use of `<script>` tags is deprecated in modern web development, and any inclusion of such tags is automatically blocked by contemporary browsers.",
"D": "The `<script>` tag enforces same-origin policy by default, and resources from cross-origin domains cannot be fetched or executed in the context of the including site."
Answer: A
