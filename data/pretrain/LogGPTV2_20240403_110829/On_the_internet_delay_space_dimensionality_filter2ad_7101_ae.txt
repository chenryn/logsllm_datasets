component. Upon applying the same decomposition analysis
to the great-circle distances of the subnetworks, we observe
no statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the power-law expo-
nent of the subnetworks as compared to the pair count and
set cover exponents found for the combined network.
It is important to emphasize that the AS relationship
graph is complex and, therefore, other forms of decompo-
sition could result in pieces that display the optimal di-
mensionality reduction. Nevertheless, the analysis presented
here shows evidence, with statistical signiﬁcance, that the
presence of Tier-1 transit links has a non-negligible eﬀect
on the Internet’s delay space geometry.
Interestingly, both fractal measures are sensitive enough
to capture this structural change, in the form of a reduction
in fractal dimension when one restricts attention to a subset
of the delay space consisting of a single Tier-1 provider and
its downstream networks. Table 2 also contains values for
the percentage variance explained by the ﬁrst three compo-
nents (i.e., the three greatest in magnitude) found by PCA.
Notice that, as opposed to the fractal measures, there is no
clear distinction in dimensionality behavior between the sub-
networks and the random sets as reported by PCA. We have
also computed the embedding dimension of each network in
Euclidean space using Vivaldi and did not observe that de-
composing the network into subnetworks had any eﬀect on
the embedding dimensionality. In fact, similarly to PCA, in
some cases, the dimensionality of subnetworks is reported as
being much greater than that of the entire network.
We hypothesize three possible explanations for the in-
sensitivity of PCA and Vivaldi to the network decomposi-
tion, which was otherwise very well captured by the fractal
measures. First, PCA and Vivaldi are oblivious to non-
linear relationships in delay space. Second, PCA and Vivaldi
try to represent non-linear relationships using linear ones.
Therefore, the process of accommodating these discrepan-
cies causes the dimensionality to inﬂate. Finally, PCA and
Vivaldi are suited to reporting an integer which summarizes
the dataset’s dimensionality; such methods are too coarse to
detect a diﬀerence of 0.2 in the dimensionality.
To conﬁrm our hypotheses we applied Isomap (see Sec-
tion 4.3.3) to the networks. Figure 7 shows the outcome of
this experiment. In the plot, the fraction of the total vari-
applied methods. Accordingly, linear methods as well as
embedding algorithms based on linear optimization prob-
lems, such as PCA and Vivaldi, are insensitive to subtle
structural features of the network, thereby explaining the
disappointing degree of accuracy observed in previous stud-
ies. Furthermore, our discovery of a dimensionality-reducing
decomposition of the delay space lends support to the theory
that embedding techniques based on hierarchical decomposi-
tions [46] may outperform existing techniques that attempt
to embed the entire distance matrix in one shot.
We leave for future work the applicability of nonlinear
dimensionality reduction techniques originally developed in
the machine learning and pattern recognition communities,
e.g., [20, 41]. These methods, including the Isomap method
brieﬂy studied in Section 5.2 as well as more recent diﬀusion-
based techniques [20], are based on metric embeddings which
can reﬂect the intrinsic geometry of datasets and allow mul-
tiscale analysis for solving dimensionality reduction, cluster-
ing and parametrization.
Finally, we expect that the future availability of more com-
prehensive datasets, containing a larger number of represen-
tatives, including hosts in edge networks, and path infor-
mation (i.e., traceroutes) will allow us to better quantify
the eﬀectiveness of the fractal measures and discover subtle
properties of the delay space geometry that cannot be fully
contemplated via analyzing the King datasets.

components of all subnetworks is consistently greater than
that of the entire network. As opposed to what PCA and
Vivaldi tell us, and in accordance with the fractal measures,
the dimensionality of the subnetworks is indeed consistently
smaller than the dimensionality of the whole network. How-
ever, the dimensionality values reported by Isomap for all
networks that is still larger than those predicted by the frac-
tal measures. This result shows evidence of non-negligible
non-linear structures in the delay space and suggests that
methods sensitive to them might reﬂect the structural prop-
erties of the Internet with superior degree of accuracy.
6. CONCLUSION
This work studies diﬀerent dimensionality measures and
investigates the dimensionality observed in the Internet de-
lay space, thus providing insight into some of the underly-
ing causes. Characterizing the geometry of the delay space
is critical for designing and analyzing eﬀective coordinate-
based positioning systems and also sheds light on the struc-
tural properties of the network.
We have observed that the Internet delay space displays
special structural and statistical characteristics in that it ad-
heres to a power-law that extends over a signiﬁcant range
of Internet distances, namely the intra-continental distances.
Therefore, its dimensionality can be characterized using frac-
tal measures, sensitive to non-linear as well as linear struc-
tures in the delay space. Moreover, they are intrinsic proper-
ties of the delay space, independent of a target host metric
space (e.g., Euclidean space). Therefore, the delay space
dimensionality can be measured without computing coordi-
nates for points, and is not subject to dimensionality inﬂa-
tion caused by embedding algorithms.
We have used the proposed fractal measures to quantify
the extent to which geodesic distances are reﬂected in the
dimensionality of the Internet, and we have also shown that,
upon decomposing the Internet into subnetworks consisting
of hosts that share an upstream Tier-1 autonomous system
in common, we observe a reduction in the intrinsic dimen-
sionality of the pieces.
Moreover, both fractal measures were able to capture the
role of the Internet’s AS-level topology in determining its
delay space geometry, a factor not revealed by previously
