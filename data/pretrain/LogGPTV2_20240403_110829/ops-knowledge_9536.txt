**User:**
Can anyone guide me on how to install OSQA on Windows 7 using XAMPP as the localhost? I'm unsure if XAMPP supports Python. Thank you in advance.

**Assistant:**
If you are open to alternatives to XAMPP, I recommend using the Bitnami native installer for OSQA. You can find it at [Bitnami OSQA Stack](http://bitnami.org/stack/osqa).

The installation process is straightforward and took me approximately 10 minutes to complete. After running the installer, OSQA was successfully set up and running on my Windows 7 localhost.
