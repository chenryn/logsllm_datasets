User: can anyone tell me that how can i install osqa on windows 7 with xampp localhost ? i don't know xampp support python.
Thanks in advance.
Assistant: If you're flexible about xampp, try bitnami native installer:

It took me about 10min for the installer to run, then I had running on Win7 localhost.
