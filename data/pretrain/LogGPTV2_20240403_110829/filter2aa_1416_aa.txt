• The journey into Software Defined Radio
• Hospital pager systems

The Electromagnetic 
Spectrum
• Electromagnetism: one of four 
universal forces
• Radio wave exists due to 
energy being propagated at a 
particular frequency
• Can create and receive radio 
waves using electronics
Transmitting Data
• Radio (carrier) wave must be modulated to 
convey information

• OOK (On‐Off Keying)
– Presence/absence of a signal
• COFDM (Coded Orthogonal Frequency‐
Division Multiplexing)

Modulation in Hardware
• MOdulation and  DE‐Modulation traditionally 
performed in hardware
• ‘Black box’ implementation
– Not re‐configurable
• Modern digital hardware allows more 
flexibility

The Mystery Signal
Rate at which ‘messages’ were transmitted 
varied throughout the day:
correlates with increased daytime activity.
Received RF signal  audio  sampled by soundcard  streamed across network
Step One: Look at the signal
Radio is already set to receive N‐FM (narrowband frequency modulated signal)
Signal in the time domain (voltage vs. time):
Signal in the frequency domain (intensity of frequency bins vs. time):
IT’S SLICER TIME!

Frequency analysis (FFT) of signal:
Two frequencies of interest
Step Two: FFT of 2FSK  Bitstream
• Lock on two frequencies (Frequency Shift Keying)
• Sample intensity of each at regular interval (baud rate)
• Pick which is the strongest:
low = 0 bit, high = 1 bit
Step Three: Data  Information
• The most difficult part, so try all combinations
Wikipedia says:
POCSAG!
• “Post Office Code Standardization Advisory Group”
• Standard decoding software didn’t work
• Key: recognisable sequence of bits when idle
Look for known codewords/repeated bit strings
Hospital Pager Systems
• High power, better penetration than mobiles
• Personnel carry small pagers, each with ID 
mapped to Radio Identity Code
• Mostly numeric pages with phone extension
• Sent via software on any computer at hospital
• Address to multiple recipients, automatically 
sent to each once
• Delivery not guaranteed
Frequencies
• Shared frequency: 148.1375 MHz (standard)
• Private systems in 800/900MHz band:
Non‐standard FSK ignored by decoders

ATCRBS, PSP & SSR
• Air Traffic Control Radar Beacon System
– Primary Surveillance Radar
– Secondary Surveillance Radar
Primary:
• Traditional RADAR
• ‘Paints skins’ and listens for return
• Identifies and tracks primary targets, 
while ignoring ‘ground clutter’
• Range limited by RADAR equation (   )

ATCRBS, PSP & SSR
• Air Traffic Control Radar Beacon System
– Primary Surveillance Radar
– Secondary Surveillance Radar
Secondary:
• Directional radio
• Requires transponder
• Interrogates transponders, which 
reply with squawk code, altitude, etc.
• Increased range (   )

The Modes
• A: reply with squawk code
• C: reply with altitude
• S: enables Automatic Dependant Surveillance‐
Broadcast (ADS‐B), and the Aircraft/Traffic 
Collision Avoidance System (ACAS/TCAS)
• Mode S not part of ATCRBS, but uses same 
radio hardware (same frequencies)
– Increasing problem of channel congestion

Response Encoding
• Data block is created & bits control position of 
pulses sent by transmitter
Pulse Position Modulation (AM)
Early chip
Late chip
Used to differentiate against other Modes
Pulse Position Modulation
• Pulse lasts 0.0000005 seconds (0.5 µs)
• Need to sample signal at a minimum of 2 MHz 
(assuming you start sampling at precisely the 
right moment and stay synchronised)
• Requires high‐bandwidth hardware and 
increased processing power
• Ideally, oversample to increase accuracy
Enter Software Defined Radio…
SDR: Digitise the baseband
• Hardware is sophisticated, but purpose is 
simple: capture a chunk of the RF spectrum 
and stream it to your computer
• Computer is responsible for doing something 
useful with baseband data
• Instead of designing RF hardware, write it in 
software!
• Increased complexity/bandwidth requires 
more CPU power (pretty cheap)
Software Defined Radio
• Hardware  software representation
– Completely re‐configurable
– Only RF front‐end kept as hardware

• Sample & quantise baseband signal
• Simple approach would be to sample voltage 
level (amplitude)

Real vs. Analytic Signals
• Real signal:
– Amplitude for each sample
– One ‘real’ number
