## Overview
- Introduction to RF (Radio Frequency)
- The journey into Software Defined Radio (SDR)
- Hospital pager systems
- Tracking planes
- Decoding satellite downlink traffic
- Direction finding

## The Electromagnetic Spectrum
- **Electromagnetism**: One of the four fundamental forces in the universe.
- **Radio Waves**: Propagated energy at a specific frequency, which can be generated and received using electronic devices.

## Transmitting Data
- **Modulation**: Essential for conveying information via radio waves.
  - **OOK (On-Off Keying)**: Presence or absence of a signal.
  - **COFDM (Coded Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing)**: Used in WiFi, DVB, DAB, WiMAX, UWB, 4G, ADSL, and PLC.

### Modulation Techniques
- **AM (Amplitude Modulation)**
- **FM (Frequency Modulation)**
- **C4FM (Continuous 4-Level Frequency Modulation)**

### Time and Frequency Domains
- **Time Domain**: Represents the amplitude over time.
- **Frequency Domain**: Represents the amplitude for each frequency.

## Hardware
- **Crystal Set Receiver**: For powerful AM transmissions.
- **Advanced Hardware**: For handling complex modulation schemes like FM, stereo FM, microwave, and digital signals.

### Modulation in Hardware
- Traditional hardware performs modulation and demodulation.
- Modern digital hardware offers more flexibility and reconfigurability.

## The Journey Begins: Genesis of RFMap
- **GSM + Gammu + Wireshark**: Field Test Mode
- **RFNetMapper**: Geolocation with GSM
- **ACMA RadCom Web Interface**: Reference for base station locations

### RFMap Web Interface
- Displays all sites, point-to-point links, and elevation data.
- Includes registered transmission sites and NASA SRTM Elevation Data.
- Site details: Frequency assignments and antenna radiation patterns.

## Amateur Radio Operators (HAMs)
- Popular sites and activities.
- Defense and ECHELON: "Joint Space Defence Research"

### Case Study: The Mystery Signal
- **Transmission Rate**: Varies with daytime activity.
- **Signal Analysis**:
  - **Step One**: Look at the signal in both time and frequency domains.
  - **Step Two**: FFT of 2FSK Bitstream.
  - **Step Three**: Decode data and extract information.
- **POCSAG (Post Office Code Standardization Advisory Group)**: Standard decoding software and recognizable bit sequences.

## Hospital Pager Systems
- **High Power**: Better penetration than mobiles.
- **Personnel Pagers**: Each with an ID mapped to a Radio Identity Code.
- **Numeric Pages**: Sent via hospital software.
- **Delivery**: Not guaranteed.
- **Frequencies**: Shared (148.1375 MHz) and private (800/900 MHz band).

### Testing on RFMap
- Examples from Sydney West Area Health Service, North Shore, Gosford, and Prince of Wales.

## Aviation Mapper
- **ATCRBS (Air Traffic Control Radar Beacon System)**:
  - **Primary Surveillance Radar**: Traditional RADAR.
  - **Secondary Surveillance Radar**: Requires transponders.
- **Modes**:
  - **A**: Squawk code.
  - **C**: Altitude.
  - **S**: ADS-B and ACAS/TCAS.
- **SSR (Secondary Surveillance Radar)**: Increased range and channel congestion.

### ADS-B (Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast)
- Provides position, heading, altitude, vertical rate, flight ID, and squawk code.
- **Mode S TX/RX**: Linked to ATC (can be at airport or remote).
- **Uplink/Downlink**: 1.03 GHz and 1.09 GHz.

### Response Encoding
- **Pulse Position Modulation (PPM)**: Differentiates against other modes.
- **Sampling Requirements**: High bandwidth and processing power.

## Software Defined Radio (SDR)
- **Digitize the Baseband**: Capture RF spectrum and stream to a computer.
- **Reconfigurable**: Only the RF front-end is hardware.
- **Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem**: Sample at twice the highest required frequency to avoid aliasing.
- **ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter)**: RX.
- **DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter)**: TX.

### Real vs. Analytic Signals
- **Real Signal**: Amplitude for each sample.
- **Analytic Signal**: Complex representation with real and imaginary parts.

This presentation provides a comprehensive overview of RF, SDR, and their applications in various fields, including healthcare and aviation.
