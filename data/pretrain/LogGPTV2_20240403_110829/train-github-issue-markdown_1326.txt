TV device does not support touch operation, users have to use Remote Control.
We need move focus by press left, top, right, bottom direction key, and when
the target widget get focus, we will press OK button to response kinds of
event. But I cannot find any flutter interface to solve this interaction, much
appreciate it if can add key event support for TV apps developed by flutter.
