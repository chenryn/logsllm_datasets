The TV device does not support touch operations, so users must use a remote control for navigation. To move the focus, users need to press the left, up, right, or down direction keys. Once the desired widget is in focus, pressing the OK button will trigger the corresponding event.

However, I have not found any Flutter interface that supports this type of interaction. It would be greatly appreciated if key event support could be added for TV applications developed with Flutter.
