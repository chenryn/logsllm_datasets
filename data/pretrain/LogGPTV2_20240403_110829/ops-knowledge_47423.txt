User: I Have add some wrong task to a celery with redis broker
but now I want to remove the incorrect task and I can't find any way to do this
Is there some commands or some api to do this ?
Assistant: try to remove the .state file and if you are using a beat worker (celery worker -B) then remove the schedule file as well
