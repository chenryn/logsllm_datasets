User: So I'm trying python 2.7 on my Windows. It is running Windows 8. I cannot add it to my path. I've done the usual: using the advanced system settings, environment variables, adding C:\Python27 in system variables.
However, when I type Python in command prompt it says 'python is not recognized ..'
Assistant: Make sure you don't put a space between the semi-colon and the new folder location that you are adding to the path.
For example it should look like...
{last path entry};C:\Python27;C:\Python27\Scripts;
...not...
{last path entry}; C:\Python27; C:\Python27\Scripts;
