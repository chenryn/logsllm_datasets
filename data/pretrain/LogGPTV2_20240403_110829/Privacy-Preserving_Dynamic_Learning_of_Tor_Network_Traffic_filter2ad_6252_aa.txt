## Abstract
Experimentation tools are essential for exploring Tor's performance and security issues, enabling researchers to conduct experiments safely and privately without jeopardizing real Tor users. However, these tools often rely on simplified assumptions and outdated measurements, leading to suboptimal configuration choices. In this work, we introduce a novel technique for dynamically learning Tor network traffic models using hidden Markov modeling and privacy-preserving measurement techniques. Over a 6-month period, we conducted a detailed and safe measurement study using 17 relays, representing approximately 2% of Tor's bandwidth. Our results provide general statistics and models that can be used to generate realistic sequences of streams and packets. We demonstrate how our models can be used to generate more accurate traffic flows in private Tor networks compared to standard and alternative methods.

## 1 Introduction
Tor is the most widely used anonymous communication system, with over six thousand volunteer relays forwarding more than 100 Gbit of traffic per second from over two million daily users as of May 2018 [37]. Tor ensures the safety and anonymity of its diverse user base, including regular Internet users, journalists, digital activists, and law enforcement, by multiplexing application streams over long-lived circuits of three independently chosen and globally distributed relays. This design prevents any single point on the path from determining both the source and destination of the communication.

Tor also serves as an open-source research and development platform, allowing researchers to analyze and experiment with new anonymous communication algorithms and protocols. However, such experiments must be conducted without compromising the privacy or anonymity of Tor users. While this safety requirement initially limited the applicability of research results, the development of Tor experimentation tools [6, 24] has enabled better understanding of how changes to Tor's path selection, load balancing, traffic admission control, congestion control, and denial of service mechanisms affect performance and security [4].

Despite the advancements, the relevance of experimental results depends on the accuracy of the network traffic models used. Previous models have been based on dated and simplified assumptions, such as single file "web" (320 KiB) and "bulk" (5 MiB) downloads [8, 39]. Limited efforts to compare experimental and real-world Tor networks have not considered important characteristics like the number and distribution of circuits, streams, and download sizes [22, 23, 51]. Thus, the efficacy of synthetic Tor network traffic models remains uncertain.

In this paper, we make four significant contributions to enhance Tor security and performance research:

1. **Measuring Tor**: We conduct a large and detailed measurement study of Tor using a privacy-preserving tool called PrivCount [26] and 17 relays, representing roughly 2% of Tor's bandwidth. Over 3 months, we measure various client and network characteristics, providing a comprehensive analysis of Tor traffic.

2. **Learning Tor Traffic**: We design novel techniques for dynamically and safely learning Tor traffic models using hidden Markov modeling (HMM). We extend PrivCount to support these techniques and iteratively train our models over 3 months. Our best model instances fit Tor traffic reasonably well and can generate realistic streams and packets.

3. **Building Traffic Models**: We develop a set of modeling semantics and a traffic generation tool called TGen, which can create complex behavior patterns. TGen allows configurable control over TCP connections and packet stream characteristics. We describe two new client models: one based on common Tor protocols (HTTP and BitTorrent) and another using our HMM-based models.

4. **Evaluating Traffic Models**: We evaluate the accuracy of our traffic models in a private Tor network deployment with 2,000 relays and up to 60,000 clients using Shadow [24]. We update Shadow's Internet model and find that our HMM-based model yields a network most similar to real Tor traffic.

Our contributions will improve the meaningful exploration of open Tor research problems, enhancing the accuracy of packet-level and higher-level simulations. The necessary changes to PrivCount and Shadow have been contributed to the open-source community and are available for use [2, 3, 4].

## 2 Methodology

### 2.1 Measurement Goals
Our primary goal is to better understand Tor traffic and its characteristics to generate more accurate traffic in private Tor networks and simulators like Shadow [24]. We conduct a large-scale Tor measurement study to achieve this, focusing on overlay network-based statistics such as distributions of bytes per stream, streams per circuit, and circuits per client.

### 2.2 Measurement Apparatus
We use multiple Tor relays as vantage points, ensuring user privacy and security through a privacy-preserving distributed measurement system, PrivCount [26].

#### 2.2.1 PrivCount Overview
PrivCount is an open-source system based on the secret-sharing variant of PrivEx [13], utilizing differential privacy [12] and secure aggregation to collect measurements across Tor relays. It consists of a tally server (TS), share keepers (SKs), and data collectors (DCs). The TS facilitates communication between SKs and DCs, while each DC extracts events from a Tor relay, adds noise, and blinds local counters. SKs combine blinding values to prevent individual contributions from being learned. At the end of the measurement phase, the TS sums the counts and removes blinding values to obtain a global, noisy count, protected under (ϵ, δ)-differential privacy.

#### 2.2.2 PrivCount Deployment
We set up a PrivCount deployment with 1 tally server, 3 share keepers, and 17 data collectors, each connected to a distinct Tor relay (6 exit and 11 non-exit relays). The nodes and relays were run by operators in Canada, France, and the United States. To reduce measurement error, we increased the sampling rate of observed traffic by running high-bandwidth relays.

| New streams | 9,000 |
| File Sharing, Other streams | 80 |
| Bytes transferred | 10 MiB |

By improving the accuracy and detail of Tor traffic models, our work will significantly enhance the quality and relevance of future Tor research.
