User: I have two python applications. I need to send commands and data between them (between two processes).
What is the best way to do that?
One program is a daemon who should accept commands and parameters from another GUI application.
How can I make daemon to monitor comands from GUI, while making it's job?
I prefer solution would be crossplatform.
p.s. I use pyqt4 and python.
Assistant: While it's not related to the way of the communication, I recommend checking out the pickle/cPickle module (which can encode objects into string streams and vice versa). Very useful.
