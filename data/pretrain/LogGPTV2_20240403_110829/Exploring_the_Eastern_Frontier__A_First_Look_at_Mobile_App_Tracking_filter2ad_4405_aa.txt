Abstract. Many mobile apps are integrated with mobile advertising
and tracking services running in the background to collect information
for tracking users. Considering China currently tops mobile traﬃc growth
globally, this paper aims to take a ﬁrst look at China’s mobile tracking
patterns from a large 4G network. We observe the dominance of the top
popular domestic trackers and the pervasive tracking on mobile apps.
We also discover a very well-connected tracking community, where the
non-popular trackers form many local communities with each community
tracking a particular category of mobile apps. We further conclude that
some trackers have a monopoly on speciﬁc groups of mobile users and
10% of users upload Personally Identiﬁable Information (PII) to trackers
(with 90% of PII tracking ﬂows local to China). Our results consistently
show a distinctive mobile tracking market in China. We hope the results
can inform users and stakeholders on the interplay between mobile track-
ing and potential security and privacy issues.
1 Introduction
Many mobile apps are bundled with mobile Advertising and Tracking Services
(ATSes). These are used for various purposes, including monetization, app
maintenance, and audience understanding [15,27,34]. This, however, can result
in such apps exposing a wide variety of information to (third-party) services,
often without a clear understanding of how it may be used. Due to the sensi-
tive nature of data accumulated on mobile devices, their prevalence has therefore
been a cause for concern [4,6,17,22,29,30]. This is particularly the case as track-
ing behavior often cannot be controlled by users, particularly after granting apps
permissions [11,40].
Due to the importance of this topic, there has been a large body of recent
research in this area, including studies that have used static app analysis [1,
2,11], dynamic device monitoring [12,25,26,28], and the inspection of network
traﬃc [13,32]. They have revealed a number of insights, including the prominence
of a small number of ATS platforms, the presence of privacy invasive leaks (e.g.

phone numbers), and various attempts at cross-device tracking. Despite this
range of insights, these studies have one common bias: they near exclusively focus
on western countries, primarily in North America and Europe. Although these
countries are both important and relevant, we posit that this bias introduces a
deﬁciency into the mobile ATS research landscape. Speciﬁcally, we have little
evidence related to how the above trends may generalize to the Chinese market.
As one of the fastest growing countries in terms of mobile traﬃc [7], we argue
that this deﬁciency must be addressed.
This paper performs the ﬁrst characterization of mobile ATS traﬃc patterns
in China. Using a dataset containing 28 billion anonymized access logs from
mobile users, we explore the distinctive properties of the tracking market in
China. Our analysis reveals a highly active ecosystem dominated by a set of
(poorly understood) major players. Due to the presence of the Great Firewall
of China (which blocks certain western services), a number of trackers are quite
distinct from those observed in past works.
Our main ﬁndings are summarized as follows:
– We reveal a distinctive mobile tracking market in China that is dominated
by several popular domestic trackers. A handful of trackers (35%) are present
in 2 or more mobile apps, implying the prevalence of cross-tracking of users.
Notably, the prominence of tracking in some types of apps (e.g. InputMethod)
raises particular concerns for user privacy.
– Popular trackers regularly co-occur with non-popular ones. Non-popular
trackers, however, tend to cluster into local communities; each community
tends to track a particular relevant type of app.
– China’s tracking services reach a majority of users, with some trackers show-
ing a tendency to exclusively track speciﬁc groups of users. As many as 10%
of users send PII data to trackers, implying the possibility of privacy leakage.
Nevertheless, 90% of PII data is conﬁned to China.
2 Dataset and Methodology
2.1 Data Description
Our dataset contains user access logs in a major 4G cellular ISP. The access logs
are generated by combining the traces of Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) deployed
at Serving Gateway (SGW) and the information provided by the Mobility Man-
agement Entity (MME). Each log corresponds to an HTTP request, and contains
the following major ﬁelds: the anonymized unique ID of the user that initiates
the request, destination IP Address, request URL, HTTP-Referrer, User-Agent,
the data volume, and the timestamp of the request initiation. In addition, to
identify the mobile apps which generate each HTTP request, the DPI appli-
ances uses a rule-based approach introduced in SAMPLES [39]. To train the
rule-set in SAMPLES, a crawl-download-execution pipeline is run across the
major Chinese app markets The rule-set is then deployed on the DPI appliances

for app identiﬁcation, and is updated routinely to include new apps. In total, we
identify 1,812 unique mobile apps.
Note that we naturally cannot extract URLs from HTTPS, accounting for
around 20% of the mobile traﬃc observed. However, we note that many apps
that use HTTPS also use HTTP. For instance, WeChat, the most popular mobile
app among Chinese diaspora, relies on HTTPS for third-party APIs, but also
issues requests to imgcache.gtimg.cn for cached images via HTTP. This means
that, even though our vantage is constrained, we can still observe activities.
Indeed, the Kendall correlation between the top-100 most popular apps in our
dataset and that obtained from [8] is 0.85, suggesting that our app traﬃc is
reﬂective of general usage. In total, the dataset contains 2,811,233,521 access
logs of 3,516,828 users in a major city of China.
2.2
Identifying ATS Domains
Inspired by [18,27], we utilize four ATS-speciﬁc lists provided by: AdBlock-
Plus [10] (the easylist and easyprivacy lists) and hpHosts [23] (the ATS list).
We further incorporate the EasyList China list given that we target China’s
Internet. These contain a set of string matching rules, and are commonly used
by ad blockers. We apply the rules to both the URL and HTTP-Referrer of each
ﬂow, such that we can also identify cases where a URL that is not classiﬁed as
an ATS was requested by an ATS [16].
In total, we attribute 260M HTTP requests (9.2%) to ATS domains, in which
16.4% are unattributable ﬂows labeled as others as mentioned above. These cover
24,985 unique fully-qualiﬁed domain names (FQDNs) and 8,773 unique second-
level domains (SLDs). Note that our focus is not only on third-party tracking
services like [3,15,33] where the ﬁrst-party domains are considered to be trusted
by users (even though they can still track users). Instead, we also inspect ﬁrst-
party trackers that collect personal data (contained within EasyPrivacy [24]).
2.3 Associating ATS Domains to Apps
Next, we identify the trackers that are used by individual mobile apps. Casual
analysis [20,38] immediately reveals a highly skewed popularity distribution of
mobile apps. The most popular app (WeChat) is accessed by 92% of users in a
single day, whereas the majority of services (outside the top 500) are accessed
by less than 0.1% of users per day. Hence, to simplify analysis, we focus on the
top-500 mobile apps, which account for 86.7% of HTTP ﬂows in our dataset.1
The easiest way to associate trackers with apps is to use the HTTP-Referrer
and User-Agent in the ATS requests [13]. However, for the majority of ATS
HTTP requests from unattributed apps, the HTTP-Referrers are empty and the
User-Agents do not meet the speciﬁcation required to identify apps. As such,
we turn to an alternative heuristic approach inspired by [31]. The intuition is

avoid potential inﬂation or bias caused by web trackers bundled in web pages.

that if an ATS is associated with a mobile app, its requests should happen at a
time close to the app’s access. Hence, we can associate an ATS request to the
closest app’s request that precedes it. A problem here is that some apps may
send background traﬃc, which may appear between the app’s requests and the
requests of the associated trackers. To mitigate this eﬀect, we divide a user’s
requests into sessions [31], where a session corresponds to a set of user activities
before an obvious pause. The session interval is set to 1 min, which is learned
empirically as in [14].
Using the above approach, we obtain 193,527,553 sessions in total, and ﬁlter
out the sessions that contain requests from more than one app. For the remain-
ing sessions (4,238,015) containing only one identiﬁed app request, we can safely
associate an ATS domain with the app. For each app, s, this results in a vector
Rs, in which an element  is an ATS domain and the number of users
seeing their association. We further mitigate another possible eﬀect that is rel-
evant to the periodic requests issued by some trackers (e.g. statistic tracking
services): One potential ﬂaw in the above approach is that certain trackers may
very rarely issue requests. Thus, these requests may appear in the sessions that
contain only a single app’s request (i.e. even when the ATS is not associated
with the app). Given that this happens only occasionally, for an app s, we ﬁlter
out those ATS domains T from Rs if ni < q (i ∈ T ), where q takes the mean
of all nj∈Rs. Finally, based on the inferred ATS domains of each app above, we
process all access logs for each user to associate the ATS request with its host
app (assuming the app’s request precedes the ATS request less than 1 second).
Importantly the ﬁltered sessions include all of the top 500 apps, and are only
used for ATS-to-app association. For other analysis (cf. Sect. 3.3), we use all
access logs.
2.4 Limitations
It is important to highlight potential limitations in our data. The four ATS
lists that we utilize for identifying ATS domains may not fully cover the current
ATSes in mobile networks in China. But we have identiﬁed a number of promi-
nent and recognized mobile tracker domains, which are in line with the Chinese
mobile ecosystem. Additionally, the heuristic method for the ATS-to-app associ-
ation may not fully capture the up-to-date ATSes of individual mobile apps. We
utilize both the app Lumen [27] and the Lightbeam tool [21] to manually test
existing ATS domains (SLDs) for the top 10 most popular apps. Our inspection
revealed an association accuracy of F1-score 0.75 (precision: 0.7, recall: 0.82).
Taking the popular video app Youku, for example, among 9 trackers inferred by
our approach, 6 dominant ones can also be detected by Lumen or Lightbeam.
One domain is not detected by our method but only monitored by Lumen; how-
ever, this domain has never been accessed in our dataset and is perhaps an
additional tracker after our dataset was collected. Finally, although it has been
shown in [39] that the rule-based approach for app identiﬁcation can achieve a
high accuracy, we are not aware of the exact accuracy because the DPI provider

keeps its implementation details conﬁdential. Thus, we cannot evaluate its accu-
racy, nor can we tell how false positives/negatives bias our results. Nevertheless,
we ﬁnd that 12% of the HTTP requests cannot be attributed to particular apps
in our dataset and are labeled as others.
2.5 Ethical Considerations
The ISP routinely collects user access logs for the purpose of improving their
service quality and security. When users subscribe to the ISP network, they are
notiﬁed that the ISP may collect and analyze their personal and access informa-
tion for the above purpose (including but not limited to tracking behavior), and
may share the information with the research community for research purposes
after anonymization. The dataset is kept in the ISP’s data center with access
being granted only to the authors’ aﬃliation. Several precautions for protecting
users’ privacy have been taken by the ISP before access is granted. For instance,
the unique user IDs are substituted with random numbers to delink the activi-
ties with speciﬁc users; all sensitive user data (e.g. IMEI) has been encrypted by
hashing. We have obtained the approval from the ISP for accessing the request
URL, HTTP-Referrer and User-Agent ﬁelds.
3 Results and Analysis
3.1 How Prevalent Are ATSes?
Presence of ATSes. Based on user request sessions produced in Sect. 2.3,
we model the domains (FQDNs) accessed within an app as a bipartite graph
G = (U, V, E), where U denotes mobile apps, V represents the ATS domains
and normal visited domains, and E is the set of edges connecting vertices in U
to vertices in V . This 2-mode graph reveals connections between ATS domains
and mobile apps. We ﬁrst analyze the number of ATSes present in each app
in graph G and present its CDF distribution in Fig. 1(a). Unsurprisingly, we
