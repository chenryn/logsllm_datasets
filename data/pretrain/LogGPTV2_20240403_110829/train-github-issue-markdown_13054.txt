I have following config in package.json:
    ...
    "babel": {
      "optional": [
        "runtime"
      ]
    },
    ...
which should add `Promise` and other classes. If I understand it correctly, it
should also shim `Array.protoype functions`.
Unfortunatelly, it does not work:
    console.log(Promise) // Object
    console.log(Array.prototype.find) // undefined
    console.log(Array.find)) // Object
Why `Array.prototype.find` is undefined. Is there something what I missed?
Thank you.
