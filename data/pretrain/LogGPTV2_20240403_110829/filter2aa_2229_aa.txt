### Interview with Joe McMoneagle on June 5, 2001

**RT:** The people I speak to seem to accept the extraterrestrial hypothesis as the least unlikely explanation. Given that so many credible individuals take this seriously, I suggest we should as well. How would you define your understanding of or relationship to UFO phenomena?

**JM:** My experiences with UFOs can be categorized into two levels: one through remote viewing and the other through personal encounters. In 1966, while in the Bahamas, I had a profound UFO experience. I was working at a downrange missile tracking site on Eleuthera Island, near Cape Canaveral. One night, around 12:30 AM, my partner and I were taking a shortcut across the sand dunes when the entire area lit up as if it were high noon. We looked up and saw a large, oblique disc, approximately 1,400 feet above us, moving in a start-stop fashion. It was extremely bright, with visible panel lines, dimples, and opaque sections. The sound disappeared, creating a bell-jar effect. After about 15 seconds, the object seemed to shoot over the horizon, though in retrospect, it may have folded out of space-time.

The next morning, my partner was hospitalized with radiation burns, and I experienced a severe sunburn. This incident convinced me of the reality of UFOs. However, I am cautious about assuming they are extraterrestrial. I believe they are intelligently powered or guided, but there is not enough evidence to definitively attribute them to extraterrestrial origins.

**RT:** There is certainly something physically real. Only those who claim to know what is in government documents or activities can assert an extraterrestrial origin. Physical descriptions like yours allow for a more tangible analysis. Based on your remote viewing, what is your best working hypothesis?

**JM:** I have several hypotheses. First, I view UFOs as time machines. If they are extraterrestrial, traveling from one star to another, they must be capable of manipulating time and space. It would be inefficient to travel vast distances without such capabilities. Therefore, these objects are likely time machines, which opens the possibility that they may have or will make contact with us in the future, sharing their technology.

I also suspect that the phenomenon of UFOs is connected to our own history. We may have appeared on Earth 190,000 years ago, but our origins could be different. There is evidence of communication between humans and non-human entities throughout history, documented in religious and medieval texts. These interactions suggest a long-standing form of communication.

**RT:** Is it all one thing? Your physical burn in 1966 and the historical accounts of encounters with entitiesâ€”can these be connected to the modern experiences of seeing lights and physical craft?

**JM:** There is a possibility. In the early 1980s, I conducted a remote viewing session where the target was a UFO sighting in Tacoma, Washington, from 1952. The session was unique; I found myself inside a white cube, where an apparition of my deceased father appeared, followed by a light being. The experience was intense and left me feeling ill. The length of my session matched the duration of the original UFO event, leading to the speculation that my remote viewing might have influenced the event itself.

These experiences blur the lines of reality and suggest a tangency of realities. I hypothesize that as sentient beings, we are immersed in a broad-spectrum noise band emanating from the core of the galaxy. This noise affects our psychic abilities and remote viewing. As we become more sophisticated, we can extract information from this noise, leading to advancements in technology and thought.

**RT:** This resonates with my experience. The Apostle Paul used the term "upward call." In the presence of superior beings, we are drawn towards latent possibilities within us. This mentoring challenges us to reach new heights, much like the monolith in "2001: A Space Odyssey."

**JM:** Exactly. Once we accept non-local consciousness and remote viewing as manifestations of this, such mentoring can occur beyond the constraints of space and time.
