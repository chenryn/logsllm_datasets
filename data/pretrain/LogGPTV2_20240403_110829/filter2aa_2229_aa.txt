Interview with Joe McMoneagle on June 5, 2001
RT: The people I speak to seem to accept the extraterrestrial hypothesis as the least
unlikely, and when so many people of this caliber take it seriously, I am suggesting that
we should too ... how would you define your understanding of or relationship to UFO
phenomena?
JM:  I have two levels of experience. One is through remote viewing. The other is what I
personally experienced. In 1966 in the Bahamas I had a UFO experience – an
unidentified flying or at least hovering object that had a profound impact on me. There
were physiological effects. I wound up getting a really bad sunburn from it. I was
working on an island called Eleuthera, a downrange missile tracking site from Canaveral,
and my partner and I were heading back toward quarters, taking a shortcut across the
sand dunes. It was about 12:30 in the morning and the whole place lit up like high noon,
as if the sun had come up. We looked up to see where the source of the light was and it
was a very large disc, an oblique disc, probably fourteen hundred feet above us, going in
a sort of start-stop fashion. It was intriguing, because it was very much there – you could
see panel lines in it and dimples and opaque sections – it was very very bright, you had to
squint – and all sound went away, it was like being in a bell jar. After about fifteen
seconds, our perception was that it shot over the horizon very quickly, almost
instantaneously, but in retrospect it could have just folded out of time-space too. He and I
went back up to the club and had  a few beers and talked about it. We decided we weren’t
going to report it because we were in the military and didn’t want to go to southeast Asia.
The next morning, he was taken back to Homestead AFB and hospitalized and I had a
really bad sunburn, what I called a sunburn, it was obviously radiation burns of some
kind. I probably got away with it better than he did because I was darker skinned at the
time. I had been in the water more. As a result of that, I was immediately convinced that
UFOs were real.
The problem I have – and I have the same problem with remote viewing – is the
automatic assumption that it is extraterrestrial-powered or driven or guided. I don’t think
there’s enough proof for that. I am more inclined to believe it’s intelligently powered or
guided.  
RT: There is certainly something physically real. Only those who claim to know what is
in government documents or activities can claim extraterrestrial origin. The only way to
assert that is crash-retrievals or captured aliens or contact scenarios including
communications. We have stories about those things but they are stories. With a physical
description like yours, we can do a physical analysis of the data. 
On the basis of your remote viewing, however – what is your best working hypothesis at
this point? The NSA targeted the dark side of the moon which did not mean looking for
aliens. The statement was made that every one of our remote viewers has contacted non-
earthly intelligence –
JM: I would agree with that to some extent.
RT: What is your hypothesis?
JM: I have a number of hypotheses. My first is this: no matter how you view it, UFOs are
time machines. Let’s say it’s extraterrestrials visiting from one star to another – that
automatically in context makes them time machines of some kind. It would not be
reliable or efficient to travel around space and take thousands of years to go from star to
star. So the fact that they are able to do that makes them time machines.
I suspect that because they are time machines, the door is automatically opened to when
and how they make contact with us. It would not surprise me if they have or will make
contact with us at some future date and share the technology and we will be using the
same technology. So when you are talking about extraterrestrials, you’re talking about us
in reality as well. So we don’t know where – a better way to put it is, we don’t know
when we came from. It may be that we came to the earth or appeared here 190,000 years
ago but when we came from may be a whole different issue. You have to look at it in a
different context. There is some evidence for that.
There is more than sufficient evidence that there has been communication between us and
non-human entities or sentient beings for thousands of years. It’s written about in our
earliest writings – in religious texts, medieval texts, everywhere. Saints battle demons.
There is so much evidence for similar occurrences going on for thousands of years. So I
think an argument can be made that the phenomena is some form of communication.
RT: Is it all one thing, though? These are complex psychological processes – and you
were burned physically in 1966. Is it all one thing? Do scriptural texts of folk documents
about people encountering entities – can we connect that experience with an experience
of the lights going on at night and you seeing a physical craft?
JM: There’s a possibility. I did a remote viewing in early 1980s, 82 or 83, where a UFO
target was mixed in with other targets so I had no idea it was a UFO target. It was very
general – the targeting material was a newspaper clipping from 1952 referring to a
sighting in Tacoma WA, a pattern of lights dancing on the horizon, people getting out of
their cars and watching for a few minutes. It was double-wrapped in a thick envelope. My
actual remote viewing was unique in that it was not the dissociative kind of RM, it was an
automatic out-of-body experience. I found myself inside a white cube. That had never
happened and has not happened since. Finding myself in this cube, I started to look for
windows, doors, some kind of ingress-egress, and while I was looking, an apparition of
my father appeared. He had died three years earlier. The apparition was very angry and
told me to leave, that I had no business being where I was, which was not my father’s
nature. He would never have done that.  So I knew it was a projection of some kind. My
response was to continue to look for an ingress-egress point. The apparition seemed to be
confused for a minute and then vanished, to be replaced by a light being that folded into
two of itself, it seemed to be arguing with itself in some strange language. My first
perception was to be concerned, my second was that I was supposed to be concerned, so I
wasn’t going to be, which confused the light being. I was then threatened with a light
being which I thought was ridiculous, I almost said it out loud. The entity argued with
itself some more then folded up and disappeared. I had a sense that something reached
inside my being and strummed a nerve ending that instantly made me ill. I felt I was
going to projectile vomit and found myself slam bang back in my body sitting bold
upright and I collided heads with my monitor. Both of us were walking around the room
holding our heads in pain. I explained to him what had happened and it turned out I had
gone almost comatose, slipped backwards on the chair, and he became concerned. He
figured things were out of control and we terminated the remote viewing. We recorded
the material and opened the envelope and discovered that the target was the UFO target.
Now, here’s the fascinating part: the length of the remote viewing session was almost
identical to the length of the UFO event. In the newspaper report, they said the lights just
winked out at the end of the UFO event. The particular physicist who had given us the
target said, jeez, I wonder if you’re the reason why the lights winked out. Or are you the
reason why there were lights in 1952? 
You have to start wondering where reality begins and ends when you get involved in
these kinds of things. For me this experience was very real but I can only report it. I think
there is a great deal of similarity between that experience and the sorts of interactions
people have reported where they have not been in control. not the standard abduction
experience. It may be a tangency of realities that we have perhaps learned to invade
because of the increase of sophistication in the way we think.
I have a hypothesis or theory about it that is kind of complicated. Do you want to hear
about it? 
RT: Yes. I am thinking of electromagnetic fields and their impact on consciousness and
trying to understand consciousness as an electromagnetic field that enables diverse kinds
of experiences to take place–
JM: I think it’s even more complicated than that. I think if you go back to the beginning,
one of the constants that has been changing very slowly but very dynamically over a long
period of time is that we have been growing more and more layers to our craniums and
becoming more and more sophisticated as sentient beings and our world has become
more and more complex. I mean by that that it took us 30,000 years to discover fire but
only a few years to learn how to build a pump laser. As we are becoming more and more
sophisticated, our ability to conceptualize is becoming more and more complex. Given
that that’s a possibility, I think what may be happening is that as sentient beings, we are
immersed in what you might call a very broad spectrum noise band. Through the studies
we’ve done on remote viewing, we’ve discovered that there’s a certain amount of noise
emanating out of the core of the galaxy and that noise has an effect on our ability to be
psychic or do remote viewing. When we’re immersed in that broadband noise, our ability
to be psychic or be a remote viewer is reduced, not because it is blocking us, but because
we’re having to deal with a whole lot more information being generated by that noise
band. Studying it from a remote viewing standpoint is very interesting, but if you take
remote viewing out of the equation and look at the fact that we have to operate while
constantly immersed in that broadband noise, we can make certain assumptions. One is
that maybe that noise isn’t nonsensical. Maybe it’s an information condition that is very
broad spectrum from which – depending on the sophistication of complexity of the
sentient being – you can extract information from that broadband information generation
at a level equivalent to your capacity. So we believe that out of our wonderment and
creativity we generate a pump laser when in fact the concepts for the reality of that may
lie within the broadband noise and only when we reach a certain level of sophistication
are we able to understand it and therefore build it. 
This implies a very interesting proposition: it implies that all sentient beings are dealing
with the same source of information. It implies that our more esoteric thoughts like
thoughts of a creator or God may be very similar across sentient minds. It implies that our
rate of growth might be accelerating and following a path that others have preceded us in.
RT: This is true to my experience. The Apostle Paul used the expression “upward call.”
My experience is that in the presence of superior beings which is the true function of
mentoring we experience an attraction toward possibilities latent in us which – if too far
away, we don’t even try to realize and which if too easy, is not a real upward call – but if
we are challenged just enough, like raising the bar just enough – 
JM: Exactly.
RT: So we are challenged to reach toward something which without the presence of the
mentor we would never have realized. Maybe the slab in 2001 was supposed to represent
this. Are you following me?
JM: Absolutely.
RT: Once you accept non-local consciousness as the nature of consciousness and remote
viewing as one manifestation of this being true, then this kind of mentoring would take
place without regard to customary notions of space and time.
