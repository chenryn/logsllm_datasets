User: How to implement user rights management in the Windows operating system? Please list at least 3 permission levels and briefly describe them.
Assistant: In the Windows operating system, user authority management can be implemented through the following three authority levels: 1. Administrator authority: Administrators have the highest authority level and can perform system-level operations, such as installing software and modifying system settings. Administrator accounts should only be granted to trusted users, and their passwords should be changed frequently to ensure system security. 2. Ordinary user privileges: Ordinary users are those who do not have administrator privileges. They can only perform tasks that they have permission to, and cannot modify or delete important files of the system. This makes the computer more secure because the user cannot inadvertently cause damage to the entire system. 3. Limited user rights: A limited user is a user who can only access a part of resources. This type of account can be used to control unauthorized access or to limit certain users' access to certain sensitive data. For example, you can create an account that only allows access to browsers on the network, but not files or settings.
