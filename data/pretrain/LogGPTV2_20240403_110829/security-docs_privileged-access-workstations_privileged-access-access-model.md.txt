# Enterprise Access Model

This document describes an overarching enterprise access model, including the context of how a [privileged access strategy](privileged-access-strategy.md) fits within it. For a roadmap on adopting a privileged access strategy, refer to the [Rapid Modernization Plan (RaMP)](security-rapid-modernization-plan.md). For implementation guidance, see [Privileged Access Deployment](privileged-access-deployment.md).

A privileged access strategy is a key component of an overall enterprise access control strategy. The following sections explain how privileged access integrates into the broader enterprise access model.

## Data and Workload Plane

The primary sources of business value that an organization must protect are located in the Data/Workload plane:

![Data/Workload Plane](./media/privileged-access-strategy/data-workload-plane.png)

Applications and data typically store a significant portion of an organization's:
- **Business processes** in applications and workloads
- **Intellectual property** in data and applications

## Management and Control Planes

The enterprise IT organization manages and supports the workloads and the infrastructure they are hosted on, whether on-premises, on Azure, or with a third-party cloud provider, forming a **management plane**. Consistent access control across these systems requires a **control plane** based on centralized enterprise identity systems, often supplemented by network access control for older systems like operational technology (OT) devices.

![Control, Management, and Data/Workload Planes](./media/privileged-access-strategy/control-management-data-workload-planes.png)

Each of these planes has control over the data and workloads, making them attractive targets for attackers if they can gain control of either plane.

## User and Application Access Pathways

For these systems to create business value, they must be accessible to internal users, partners, and customers using their workstations or devices (often via remote access solutions), creating **user access** pathways. They must also frequently be available programmatically via application programming interfaces (APIs) to facilitate process automation, creating **application access** pathways.

## Privileged Access Pathways

Finally, these systems must be managed and maintained by IT staff, developers, or other personnel, creating **privileged access** pathways. Given the high level of control they provide over business-critical assets, these pathways must be rigorously protected against compromise.

## Implementing Consistent Access Control

To ensure consistent access control that enhances productivity and mitigates risk, you should:
- Enforce Zero Trust principles on all access
  - Assume breach of other components
  - Explicit validation of trust
  - Least privilege access
- Apply pervasive security and policy enforcement across
  - Internal and external access to ensure consistent policy application
  - All access methods, including users, admins, APIs, service accounts, etc.
- Mitigate unauthorized privilege escalation
  - Enforce hierarchy to prevent control of higher planes from lower planes (via attacks or abuse of legitimate processes)
    - Control plane
    - Management plane
    - Data/workload plane
  - Continuously audit for configuration vulnerabilities enabling inadvertent escalation
  - Monitor and respond to anomalies that could represent potential attacks

## Evolution from the Legacy AD Tier Model

The enterprise access model supersedes and replaces the legacy tier model, which was focused on containing unauthorized privilege escalation in an on-premises Windows Server Active Directory environment.

The enterprise access model incorporates these elements and addresses the full access management requirements of a modern enterprise that spans on-premises, multiple clouds, internal or external user access, and more.

### Tier 0 Scope Expansion

Tier 0 expands to become the control plane, addressing all aspects of access control, including networking where it is the only or best access control option, such as for legacy OT options.

### Tier 1 Splits

To increase clarity and actionability, what was previously Tier 1 is now split into the following areas:
- **Management plane** – for enterprise-wide IT management functions
- **Data/Workload plane** – for per-workload management, which is sometimes performed by IT personnel and sometimes by business units

This split ensures a focus on protecting business-critical systems and administrative roles with high intrinsic business value but limited technical control. It also better accommodates developers and DevOps models rather than focusing too heavily on classic infrastructure roles.

### Tier 2 Splits

To ensure coverage for application access and various partner and customer models, Tier 2 was split into the following areas:
- **User access** – which includes all B2B, B2C, and public access scenarios
- **App access** – to accommodate API access pathways and the resulting attack surface
