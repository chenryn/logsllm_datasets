1. Summary
SWIFT plays a key role in helping its community to reinforce and safeguard the integrity of the global 
financial ecosystem, and maintains a relentless focus on security. As part of that focus, SWIFT has an ongoing 
commitment to intelligence sharing and thought leadership that contribute to the community’s understanding 
of the cyber threat and tactics of cyber criminals. One area where the community has expressed interest in 
gaining more insight is around the approaches cyber criminals use to extract money once they have executed a 
successful attack. With this in mind, SWIFT commissioned BAE Systems to research and write this report. Its aim 
is to illuminate the tactics and techniques used by cyber criminals to cash out so that the SWIFT community 
can better protect itself, through both cybersecurity controls and financial crime compliance processes.
Large scale cyber heists, in which cyber-attackers manage to steal significant amounts of money from banks, 
continue to create news headlines. Various reports have been produced previously on how some of these 
attacks, such as those against banks’ high-value payment systems, succeed and how organisations can 
mount better defences. BAE Systems and SWIFT have jointly published reports on cyber heist techniques 
used against financial institutions and the evolution of the cyber threat to the banking community in 2017¹ and                             
2019² respectively.
However, to date, there has not been significant material published on what happens to funds after they have 
been stolen. This report focuses on that area, specifically the money laundering related activities necessary for 
cyber-attackers to not only conduct and ‘cash out’ a successful attack but also avoid the money subsequently 
being traced.
This report describes how money laundering is typically performed in the context of large-scale cyber heists. 
It illustrates key parts of the typical processes used by cyber-criminals with examples to help better inform 
readers on areas they should focus on to better prevent, detect and respond to money laundering. In addition, 
the report offers perspectives on areas in which controls could be further improved and how money laundering 
techniques may evolve.

2. Introduction
The activities of all cyber-criminals, whether working individually, as part of a small gang, as organised crime 
groups, or even for a nation state, have resulted in annual total cyber-crime revenue estimated at USD1.5 trillion³. 
Banks remain a prime target for cyber-criminals because they are critical infrastructure that can facilitate direct 
access to cash/funds.
The financial industry, however, is not an easy target. Banks, law enforcement and industry bodies continue 
to evolve cyber defences, improve information sharing, and regularly prevent money from ultimately being 
stolen even when the first stage of a cyber-attack may have seemed successful. Cross industry efforts such as 
SWIFT’s Customer Security Programme (CSP), which provides tools, information and a framework to help the 
SWIFT community secure itself, and payments screening services continue to evolve to mitigate cyber-attacks. 
For example, 91% of SWIFT customers, representing 99% of SWIFT traffic, attested to their compliance with 
controls set out by the latest Customer Controls Security Framework, a set of security controls which serve as 
the cornerstone of CSP. In addition, banks have improved response security controls such as the ability to stop or 
recall fraudulent payment instructions where these are identified quickly enough. 
However, the lure of targeting banks to get ready access to cash remains prevalent, and attackers continue 
to develop their techniques. In recent years, many attacks have moved from targeting high-value payment 
systems to targeting ATM networks and related systems. While these may, on the face of it, seem to have a 
lower inherent value as any ATM inherently holds a limited amount of cash, in terms of successfully obtaining 
multi-million dollar sums of money across a number of attacks, this has to date proved to be a successful 
alternate route for attackers.
But irrespective of the cyber-attack method, the challenge all criminals face after a successful cyber-attack is 
getting hold of cash or other liquid financial assets that are perceived as ‘clean’, i.e. where it is not possible to tell it 
is from the proceeds of crime. This is where the need for money laundering comes in.
The money laundering and associated techniques described in this report are those considered relevant to 
large-scale cyber heists against banks’ high-value payment systems and ATM related systems, including  back-
office payment systems. Such cyber attacks involve being able to manipulate or subvert the correct operation 
of high-value payment systems or management systems controlling a number of ATMs. This paper has not 
specifically considered what happens to money stolen in other financial crime related attacks such as physical 
attacks against individual ATMs, card skimming and cloning, banking Trojans and malware, authorised push 
payment or business email compromise type attacks. However, the money laundering techniques and controls 
described are likely to also be relevant in many of these cases.

3. Money Laundering Overview
In the strictest sense, money is laundered whenever a person or business deals in any way with another person 
or organisation’s benefits from crime. Traditionally, money laundering has been described as a process which 
takes place in three stages: placement, layering and integration: 
• 
Placement – Criminally derived funds are introduced into the financial system in the case of an ATM style 
attack, or, in the case of a cyber heist against a bank’s high value payment systems; placement covers the 
initial fraudulent movement of funds
• 
Layering – Illicit funds are moved through the financial system in order to disguise their origin and 
ownership. This is the most substantive phase of the process
• 
Integration – Laundered funds are re-introduced into the legitimate economy, or reinvested into the 
criminal enterprise
Various methods underpin how funds are typically removed from a bank during a large-scale cyber-heist, as 
well as the money laundering techniques that aim to conceal their subsequent movement. There can also be 
significant overlap between the money laundering phases in reality.

 3.1 Preparatory Activities
For large-scale cyber heists to be successfully executed, attackers need to perform a number of steps in advance. 
Outside of those relevant to successfully conducting the cyber element of the heist, which are not the focus of 
this paper, money laundering steps the attackers need to complete include:
• 
Setting up or gaining access to bank accounts into which stolen funds can be initially received, or in the case 
of ATM-related heists, the attackers need to recruit and train money-mules to take the stolen cash out of 
the ATMs
• 
Recruiting money-mules to transfer the stolen funds out of those accounts

3.1.1 Account set up
• 
Setting up accounts to be used in a cyber-heist is a key step as these accounts will 
be the destination of the funds after they have been stolen, also known as the 
‘end-beneficiary’. There have been many instances where these accounts have 
been set up in good faith, believing that the account holders are genuine and 
of decent integrity, due to the use of false identification documents or by using 
legitimate identification documents from individuals who have been coerced by 
criminals to allow the account to be used. There have also been instances where 
existing accounts were used – for example where an individual who no-longer 
has a requirement for their valid account hands it over to someone else, rather 
than closing it. The establishment of these fraudulent accounts, by whichever 
method, might be facilitated by weak or ineffective policies and controls 
linked to the customer due diligence processes and also by lack of training of                           
front-line staff.
• 
In order to avoid suspicion, fraudulent accounts might be set up several months 
before the heist, and so are empty and unused. Assigning fake projects and 
companies to these fraudulent accounts serves the purpose of giving credibility 
as well as explaining why, at some point, they will be in receipt of large money 
transfers. In line with this, as an additional obfuscation technique, accounts linked 
to fake organisations may be set up to be used as a hub and collation point for 
stolen funds after they have been transferred to the initial fraudulent accounts.
• 
The effectiveness of a financial institution’s Know Your Customer (KYC) and 
screening processes are also important factors – and is likely why certain 
institutions in certain jurisdictions are targeted for illicit activity. The ‘Know Your 
Customer’ process is a vital part of validating users - from simple name screening 
and undertaking background checks through to enhanced due diligence (EDD) 
with independent assurance provided by two person validation to provide greater 
level of scrutiny. If these processes are weak or ineffective, or if the staff is poorly 
trained, then this allows these checks to be ineffective. Furthermore, there have 
been cases where a complicit or coerced insider has helped to evade or reduce the 
scrutiny of compliance teams carrying out KYC and due diligence checks of new                   
account openings.

• 
For ATM cashouts, the nature of account set-up differs 
depending on the type of method used. 
• 
ATM FASTCash involves the fraudulent duplication 
of legitimate cards, which requires cyber-criminals 
to access customer records in order to create a          
duplicate card.
• 
ATM cashouts involve an insider creating a phantom 
transfer of funds to accounts that are owned by 
recruited money-mules. In order to create a layer 
of obfuscation, fake identities are used for these 
accounts so that the mule’s identity is concealed.
• 
ATM management cashouts that involve a cyber-
intrusion which remotely controls ATMs do not require 
accounts to be set up to carry-out the heist. 
3.1.2 
Recruit money-mules
• 
A common denominator that underpins cyber-heists is 
the essential function of the money-mule – irrespective 
of the diversity of the cyber-crime group, the execution 
of the heist, or the final destination of laundered funds. 
Their role seeks to provide the obfuscation in the chain 
between the initial fraud in the bank and the transfer 
of stolen funds to cyber-criminals. Accounts used for 
money-muling may be created by those complicit in 
the criminal activity or may belong to unsuspecting 
individuals tricked into allowing their account to be used 
for criminal purposes. These are the various actions that 
would qualify as a money-mule supporting cyber-heists:
• 
Someone’s bank account being controlled and taken 
over by a cyber-criminal / selling control to a cyber-
criminal.
• 
Receiving funds into a bank account before onward 
transfer to a cyber-criminal.
• 
Using a fake identity to open an account for the sole 
purpose of benefiting a cyber-criminal.
• 
Re-shipping items purchased by a cyber-criminal 
using stolen banking details.
• 
Collecting stolen funds via ATM cash outs.

• 
Cyber-criminals have become more creative with their methodologies for 
recruiting money-mules. Some cyber-criminals often dupe innocent victims 
into laundering money on their behalf with the promise of easy money by 
using seemingly legitimate job adverts, online posts, social media and other 
methods. This includes incorporating aspects like diversity and inclusion (D&I) 
into job adverts to encourage a person to believe the company is real, as well 
as creating fake management teams. Some job adverts appear to be targeted 
towards people based in countries that are not typical financial targets, (e.g. 
UK, US, and Australia).  For cyber-criminals in Eastern Europe this recruitment 
technique serves as further obfuscation, due to international transfers increasing 
the complexity. 
• 
Many money-mule recruitment efforts focus on individuals, especially young 
adults including those seeking to fund higher education and adults recently out of 
work, who are likely to jump at the chance to apparently easily earn extra cash. 
Some examples of money-mule related job adverts are shown on the following 
page, indicating that in many cases, the money-mules are not strongly linked 
with the cyber-attackers.

• 
Some cyber-criminals that are part of a large organised crime group are able to 
draw upon a cadre of associates for money-muling purposes. For nation-state 
cyber-groups which specialise in the ATM FASTCash technique, their links with 
various criminal groups in East Asia are utilised in order to recruit money-mules to 
travel to specific locations in order to withdraw cash from ATMs.

3.2  Placement
Placement involves the initial movement of stolen funds into the financial system. This can be the initial account 
into which stolen funds are transferred, or in the case of large-scale ATM based heists, the method of converting 
the cash obtained in a local currency into a more transferable currency, such as USD$.
3.2.1 Use of Money-mules
Money-mules serve as intermediaries for cyber-
criminals and criminal organisations, where they act 
as a bridge between the exfiltration of stolen funds 
from a bank to transferring these funds to criminal 
benefactors. In this way, the money-mule is the 
essential first step in the placement of criminally 
derived funds into the financial system.  
The number of money-mules involved in 
placement activities for a large-scale cyber-heist 
varies but has often been seen to involve around 10 
individuals. However, there are of course exceptions 
to this. For example, an attack against one bank 
which is considered to be linked to the Lazarus 
Group involved 12,000 ATM withdrawals being
