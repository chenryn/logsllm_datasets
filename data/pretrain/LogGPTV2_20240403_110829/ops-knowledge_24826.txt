User: I am running a python script of web2py and want to log its output. I am using following command
nohup python /var/www/web2py/web2py.py -S cloud -M -N -R applications/cloud/private/process.py >>/var/log/web2pyserver.log 2>&1 &
The process is running but it is not logging into the file. I have tried without nohup also but it is still same.
The default logging of nohup in nohup.out is also not working.
Any suggestion what might be going wrong?
Assistant: nohup will try to create the file in the local directory. Can you create a file in the folder you are running it from ?
