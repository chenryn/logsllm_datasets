Ontology Domains. In (Cardoso, J., Sheth, A., 2006), the authors identify the state of the art of the
applications that use semantics and ontologies. They identified various applications ranging from
the use of semantic Web services and discovery, semantic integration of tourism information
sources, semantic digital libraries, semantic grids, semantic enterprise information integration,
semantic Web search to the development of bioinformatics ontologies.
To determine the actual trend in the development of ontologies for particular domains, we asked
all respondents to indicate for which industries they were representing knowledge with ontologies.
The survey provides the perspective of individuals from a wide range of industries. Education and
Computer Software are the best represented industries (31% and 28.5%, respectively), followed by
Government (17%) and Business Services (17%). Other notable industries are the Life Sciences
(16.5%), Communications (13%), the Media (12.8%) and Healthcare providers (11.3%). See
Figure 7. Other less significant/prominent industries (not shown in the graph) include Accessibility,
Agriculture, Archaeology, eRecruitment, Geography, Geosciences, Human Resource Management,
Microelectronics, Physics, Satellites, Sports, and the Toy industry.

Methodologies. In software engineering to build a software product a methodology needs to be
adopted and followed. Since ontologies are considered to be software products, methodologies,
methods and techniques are indispensable to document a development process for building

ontologies. Ontological Engineering (OE) is the discipline that studies such methodologies
(Gómez-Pérez, A., M. Fernández-López, and O. Corcho, 2007). It as been considered that OE is
still a relatively immature discipline and most work groups utilize their own methodology.
We asked all respondents to indicate which methodology or method they were employing to
develop their ontologies. We were overcome by the percentage of respondents (60%) that develop
ontologies without using any methodology. The methodologies with greatest adoption among
ontologists are METHONTOLOGY (13.7%) followed by On-To-Knowledge methodology (7.4%)
and Uschold and King’s method (4.2%). Other less popular/less commonly used methods include
Cyc method, Gruninger and Fox’s methodology, DILIGENT method, KACTUS method, SENSUS
method, and Noy and McGuinness method.

Purpose of using ontologies. Organizations use ontologies for different purposes. We asked
participants to tell us the reasons, identified by Noy and McGuinness (2001), that motivated them
to use ontologies.
The vast majority of participants (69.9%) answered that they use ontologies to share common
understanding of the structure of information among people or software agents, so models can be
understood by humans and computers. The second reason for using ontologies is to enable reuse of
domain knowledge (56.3%). Approximately equal numbers of respondents use ontologies to make
domain assumptions explicit (36.9%) and to analyze domain knowledge (34.2%). A smaller
number of participants answered to separate domain knowledge from operational knowledge
(29.9%). Finally, other answers (12.4%) indicated that ontologies are also used for code generation,
data integration, data publication and exchange, document annotation, information retrieval, search,
reasoning, annotating experiments, building common vocabularies, web service discovery or
mediation, and enabling interoperability. The results are shown in Figure 9.

Techniques used with ontologies. We asked respondents to tell us if they used any specific
technique to manipulate ontologies such as mapping, aligning, merging and integration. The results
are shown in Figure 10. The largest segment of respondents (67.1%) indicated that they use
ontology mapping, i.e. relating similar concepts or relations from different sources to each other by
an equivalence relation. Roughly equal numbers of participants indicated that they were integrating
ontologies (40.7%), i.e. building a new ontology reusing other available ontologies (assemble,
extend, specialize), and merging ontologies (33.9%), i.e. merging different ontologies about the
same subject into a single one that unifies all of them. Twenty six percent stated that they align
ontologies, i.e. they bring two or more ontologies into mutual agreement, making them consistent
and coherent. Finally, more than fifteen percent of respondents indicated that they perform
ontology learning, ontology matching, ontology mediation, ontology pruning, and ontology
versioning.

Purpose of using ontologies. A quick look at real-world ontologies that have already been
developed makes us wonder about the size of ontologies developers are creating. From life
sciences, we can find examples of ontologies with as few as 195 concepts (protein-protein
interaction) and 227 (MGED), to ontologies with 2222 concepts (BRENDA), and even
large ontologies with 200.002 concepts (GO).
We asked each respondent to indicate the average size of the smallest, typical, and biggest
ontologies they were working with. The results are shown in Figure 11. A vast majority of
respondents (72.9%) indicated that their smallest ontologies had less than 100 concepts and 20.5%
considered that they had between 100 and 1000 concepts. When asked about typical ontologies,
forty four percent of respondents stated that such types of ontology had between 100 and 1000
concepts and 35% considered that typical ontologies in their organization have less than 100
concepts. Finally, when asked about the biggest ontologies being deployed, the majority of
respondents, 33.5%, considered that this type of ontology had between 100 and 1000 concepts.
Roughly equal numbers of respondents, 17.9%, 15.8%, and 16.6%, stated that their biggest
ontologies had a number of concepts within the ranges 0-99, 1001-2000, and >10000, respectively.
One surprising conclusion from this data is that the ontologies being developed are much smaller in
size than can be ascertained from many research papers and conference keynotes and talks.

Production. Each respondent was asked to indicate the estimated time before putting an ontology-
based system into production. More that 70% of all respondents indicated that they planned to
adopt ontology-based systems (Figure 12). A considerable number of participants (27.9%) indicate
that they do not have any plans to use such types of systems in the future. More than twenty five
(25.4%) of the respondents indicated that their organization was currently active in the
development and installation of ontology-based systems. Almost 21% stated that they will put their
ontology-based systems into production within 6 months, while 13.7% will have to wait one more
year. Clearly many organizations will be active in this area in 2007. The remaining respondents
answered that they will install ontology-based systems in 18 months (3.7%) and in 24 months
(8.2%).

4. CONCLUSIONS
The Semantic Web vision: Where are we? Where are we heading? While some people think the
Semantic Web is just research, this is a misconception since it is already in use and starting to reach
the market. The study presented in this article is a fundamental checkpoint to frame the current
status and trends in the Semantic Web. We can easily observe that it has already caused a paradigm
change from an idea to the development and use of real and concrete solutions. But what lessons
can we learn from this study? Can we extrapolate from them what will be important in the future
Semantic Web? These are the answers this article provides. For example, this study shows that the
Semantic Web does not require complex ontologies. In fact, the large majority of ontologies
developed are rather small. It shows that the Semantic Web does not even need OWL and can

achieve important objectives such as data-sharing and data-integration using just RDF alone. From
the different uses of ontologies, respondents used them mainly to share common understanding of
the structure of information among people or software agents, so models can be understood by
humans and computers. It also demonstrates that 70% of people working on the Semantic Web are
committed to deploying real-world systems that will go into production in less than 2 years.
