User: How to use docker compose to configure and start a multi-container application?
Assistant: To configure and start a multi-container application using docker compose, the following steps are required: 1. Write a docker-compose.yaml file: This file is used to define the interaction relationship and service configuration between multiple containers, including container names, images, and ports Mappings, environment variables, etc. 2. Run the docker-compose up command in the directory where docker-compose.yaml is located: this command will start all the required containers according to the definition in the docker-compose.yaml file, and establish the communication relationship between the containers. 3. You can use the docker-compose ps command to view the running containers. 4. You can use the docker-compose logs command to view the log output of the container. 5. You can use the docker-compose down command to stop and delete all related containers, networks, and volumes. For example, the following is a simple sample docker-compose.yaml configuration file: ```yaml version: '3.0' services: web: image: nginx:latest ports: - "80:80" api: image: node:latest ports : - "3000:3000" working_dir: /usr/src/app volumes: - .:/usr/src/app command: npm run start depends_on: - db db: image: mongo:latest ``` This configuration file defines Three services: web, api and db, which are mirror images of nginx, node and mongodb respectively. The web service maps port 80 to port 80 of the host, and the api service maps port 3000 to port 3000 of the host, and specifies to mount the current directory of the host to the /usr/src/app directory of the container for use in the container local files. The api service also specifies a startup command of npm run start, which means running the npm script to start the service. The db service represents the mongodb container, on which the other two services depend. After running the docker-compose up command, the three services will be started at the same time, and the network connection between the containers will be established. Users can access the web service by visiting localhost:80 and the api service by visiting localhost:3000.
