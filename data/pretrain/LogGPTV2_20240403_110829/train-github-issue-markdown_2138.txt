# ISSUE TYPE
  * Bug Report
##### COMPONENT NAME
ansible-pull
##### ANSIBLE VERSION
    ansible 2.1.2.0
##### OS / ENVIRONMENT
N/A
##### SUMMARY
Not sure if this is a problem or just me doing it wrong, but I can not add a
custom path for the known_hosts file for ansible-pull.
##### STEPS TO REPRODUCE
By default, ansible-pull uses the known_hosts file located at
`~/.ssh/known_hosts` but I should be able to add a custom one with `--ssh-
common-args=UserKnownHostsFile=~/my_temporary_known_host`  
Unfortunately, this setting is ignored by ansible-pull and the git checkout
fails.
