### ISSUE TYPE
- Bug Report

### COMPONENT NAME
- ansible-pull

### ANSIBLE VERSION
- 2.1.2.0

### OS / ENVIRONMENT
- N/A

### SUMMARY
I am unable to specify a custom path for the `known_hosts` file when using `ansible-pull`. The default location, `~/.ssh/known_hosts`, is used regardless of any additional arguments I provide.

### STEPS TO REPRODUCE
1. By default, `ansible-pull` uses the `known_hosts` file located at `~/.ssh/known_hosts`.
2. I attempted to specify a custom `known_hosts` file by using the `--ssh-common-args=UserKnownHostsFile=~/my_temporary_known_host` argument.
3. However, this setting is ignored, and the git checkout fails with an error indicating that the host key is unknown.

#### Command Used:
```sh
/usr/local/mydir/bin/ansible-pull -i myinventory -U ssh://git@mygit -C master --private-key=mykey --ssh-common-args=UserKnownHostsFile=~/my_temporary_known_host
```

#### Error Output:
```json
localhost | FAILED! => {
    "changed": false, 
    "failed": true, 
    "msg": "mygit has an unknown hostkey. Set accept_hostkey to True or manually add the hostkey prior to running the git module"
}
```

### EXPECTED BEHAVIOR
- `ansible-pull` should use the specified custom `known_hosts` file (`~/my_temporary_known_host`) when the `--ssh-common-args=UserKnownHostsFile=~/my_temporary_known_host` argument is provided.

### ACTUAL BEHAVIOR
- `ansible-pull` ignores the `--ssh-common-args=UserKnownHostsFile=~/my_temporary_known_host` argument and continues to use the default `~/.ssh/known_hosts` file, resulting in a failed git checkout due to an unknown host key.
