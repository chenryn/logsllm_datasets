### Chipset and Client-Side Detection
Some applications have replicated similar client-side detection methods without the need for a rooted phone [15, 37]. Van den Broek et al. proposed a pseudo-random IMSI that would prevent entities other than the home operator from distinguishing particular users [13]. However, this approach introduces higher overhead in roaming scenarios and needs to be extended to cover cases where IMSI catchers use additional identification numbers, such as IMEI.

### Provider-Side Detection
Van Do et al. are the only researchers to focus on the provider side of IMSI catcher detection [16]. Their solution is based on detecting encryption elimination and anomalies, such as the disappearance of a large group of phones in a geographical area, using a machine learning system. However, their approach has limited applicability in real-world networks. Disabling encryption is found only in older IMSI catchers, and the latency for detecting disappearances can be up to 24 hours, which is the time scale of periodic location updates. This method is effective only for IMSI catchers operating for an extended period.

### Working Principle of IMSI Catchers
Osipov and Zaitsev reverse-engineered a Huawei Femtocell and created a 3G IMSI catcher, testing phone implementations for messages where integrity is ignored [35]. Shaik et al. researched 4G IMSI catchers and their capabilities [38]. Dunkelman et al. studied the KATSUMI algorithm, on which A5/3 is based, but found the attack impractical in real-world networks [17].

### Related Attacks on Cellular Devices
Several attacks are relevant as they are performed directly or in conjunction with IMSI catchers:

- **SS7 MSISDN Lookup**: IMSI catching does not reveal the telephone number (MSISDN) of the subscriber. An attacker with access to the international interconnect network using SS7 can request subscriber information based on the IMSI or TMSI, similar to any roaming network [19].
  
- **SS7 Session Keys**: An attacker with access to the SS7 network can retrieve RAN session keys [19, 34]. This key retrieval is a legitimate function required for roaming support. SS7 stateful firewalls can block such requests.
  
- **SIM Card Rooting**: Several SIM card attacks described by Nohl et al. [33] have been blocked by network operators. However, an IMSI catcher can communicate directly with the UE/MS, allowing the attacker to perform attacks such as retrieving SIM card application keys, potentially giving them control over the installation of new SIM card applications on the victim's device.
  
- **SIM Card Cloning**: In 1998, Briceno, Goldberg, and Wagner reverse-engineered and broke the COMP128 key derivation algorithm, enabling the cloning of GSM SIM cards [11, 12]. In 2015, Liu et al. [30] found that some USIM implementations using the AES-based MILENAGE algorithm are vulnerable to power-based side-channel analysis, allowing for cloning.

- **Unauthenticated SMS**: 2G and some 3G devices allow the reception of SMS messages while captured by a rogue base station [35]. This is surprising for 3G, as it is prohibited by current standards. However, many phones still accept these messages. 4G SMS works differently and is not affected by this vulnerability, although other vulnerabilities exist [41].

- **Presidential Alert Cell Broadcast**: A feature known as presidential alert messages [6] is a special form of short messages that cannot be suppressed and interrupt the phone in any state. A fake base station can send out these messages.

- **GPS Lookup Initialized by Network**: The Radio Resource Location Services (RRLP) protocol allows the network to trigger a GPS localization on the phone and submit the location back to the network [4]. Harald Welte demonstrated that this happens without any authentication [42].

- **Measurement Triangulation**: The network can request measurement reports to other cells in the vicinity. A fake base station can use these reports to estimate the position of the phone based on signal levels and known positions of the cells. This is also possible on 4G [38].

- **Disable GPS**: Due to former Egyptian regulations, some older phones (e.g., iPhone [21], Nokia [5]) disable the GPS receiver when associated with or in the vicinity of a network using the Egyptian Mobile Country Code. An attacker can use this to disable the GPS receiver on certain phones.

### Conclusion
IMSI catchers remain a significant problem for today's networks:
- **Tracking IMSI Catchers**: These work directly on GSM, UMTS, and LTE networks as Location/Tracking Update Rejects are excluded from cryptographic message integrity checks. Mutual authentication only prevents plain capturing IMSI catchers.
- **Downgrade Attacks**: Reject messages can be used to downgrade a phone until the next reboot to a lower access technology (e.g., GSM) without mutual authentication, making the weakest-link principle applicable.

In this paper, we analyzed different types of IMSI catchers, their working principles, and detection methods from the network operator's side. Through our cooperation with a European carrier, we systematically performed real-world experiments and tested our detection methods on real-world data.

Strong indicators include the usage of invalid LACs (transmitted by phones when they fall back to the genuine network after an attack) and the usage of weak ciphers to detect downgrade attacks for devices previously able to use strong ones. Additionally, we showed that multiple weak indicators can be correlated geographically, temporally, and on a subscriber basis, similar to current fraud detection schemes used by credit card companies. This includes fingerprinting devices based on profiles, unusual movements, and implausible location update trails. We also addressed corner cases and how to handle them.

Mobile networks were initially designed to reduce signaling traffic, so not all necessary information is readily available for analysis or centrally collected. Some of the indicators we identified require changes in the monitoring systems currently used in such networks. However, based on available data from a real-world mobile network, we demonstrated the practical applicability of several of our methods.
