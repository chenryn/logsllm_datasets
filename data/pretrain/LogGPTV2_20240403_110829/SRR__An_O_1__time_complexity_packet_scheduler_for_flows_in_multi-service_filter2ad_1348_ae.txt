### A. Proof of Proposition

Given the chain between two adjacent occurrences of element \( S_i \) as:
\[ S_{i-1}, S_{i-2}, \ldots, S_1, S, S_1, \ldots, S_{i-2}, S_{i-1} \]

Thus, the proposition follows by induction.

### B. Proof of Theorem 2

**Observation:**
Before proving Theorem 2, we observe that the maximum value of \( V_w \) in the context of Shortest Remaining Round (SRR) scheduling only depends on the flows \( f \) and \( g \). Although other flows may change the time distribution, they do not affect the service sequence of \( f \) and \( g \). Therefore, we only consider the service sequence involving \( f \) and \( g \).

It is clear that the theorem holds when \( w_f = 1 \) and \( w_g = 1 \).

From Lemma 2, we know that at the end of each round, \( V_w \) is bounded. Thus, we only need to prove Theorem 2 for the first round, where \( V_w \leq 0 \).

**Proof:**
We prove this theorem by induction.

1. **Base Case:**
   When \( k = 1 \), consider all 9 combinations of \( w_f \) and \( w_g \) from the set \{1, 2, 3\}. It is straightforward to show that:
   \[
   \max(V_{w_f}(t, 0) - V_{w_g}(t, 0)) \leq \max(w_f, w_g)
   \]

2. **Inductive Step:**
   Assume the inequality holds for a \( k \)-th Weighted Shortest Service (WSS) schedule, i.e., for any pair of \( w_f \) and \( w_g \):
   \[
   V_{w_f}(t, 0) - V_{w_g}(t, 0) \leq k \cdot \max(w_f, w_g)
   \]

   We need to show that the inequality holds for a \((k+1)\)-th WSS schedule. For any pair of \( w_f \) and \( w_g \) using a \((k+1)\)-th WSS, \( w_f' \) and \( w_g' \) can be expressed as:
   \[
   w_f' = w_f + a_f, \quad w_g' = w_g + a_g
   \]
   where \( a_f, a_g \in \{0, 1\} \).

   The service sequence of flows \( f' \) and \( g' \) can be written as:
   \[
   S_{k+1}(f', g') = S_k(f, g) \cup \{a_f, a_g\}
   \]

   When \( V_{f'} = V_f + 1 \) and \( V_{g'} = V_g + 1 \), we name the subsequence before \( f' \) and \( g' \) as the left part and the subsequence after \( f' \) and \( g' \) as the right part.

   There are 4 cases based on the values of \( a_f \) and \( a_g \):

   1. \( a_f = 0 \) and \( a_g = 0 \)
   2. \( a_f = 0 \) and \( a_g = 1 \)
   3. \( a_f = 1 \) and \( a_g = 0 \)
   4. \( a_f = 1 \) and \( a_g = 1 \)

   These cases can be proven similarly. We will demonstrate the proof for the last case:

   - **Case 4: \( a_f = 1 \) and \( a_g = 1 \)**
     \[
     V_{w_f'} - V_{w_g'} = 2(w_f + 1) - 2(w_g + 1) + V_f - V_g
     \]
     \[
     = 2w_f - 2w_g + V_f - V_g
     \]
     \[
     \leq 2 \cdot \max(w_f, w_g) + V_f - V_g
     \]
     \[
     \leq (k+1) \cdot \max(w_f, w_g)
     \]

   Therefore, for all 4 cases:
   \[
   V_{w_f'} - V_{w_g'} \leq (k+1) \cdot \max(w_f, w_g)
   \]

Thus, Theorem 2 follows by induction.
