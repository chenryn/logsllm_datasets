User: Please describe its function and how to build and use according to the following Docker file. ]
Assistant: basic image is given in the Docker file, and the Node.js application environment is built by installing Node.js and npm. The specific operation is as follows: - Build a mirror image: use the command `docker build -t my-node-app .` to build a mirror named `my-node-app`, the `-t` parameter is used to specify the image name, `.` Indicates the current directory where the Dockerfile is located. - Run the container: Use the command `docker run -p 8080:8080 my-node-app` to run the image as a container, the `-p` parameter is used to specify the port mapping, and map the local port 8080 to the port 8080 of the container . To deploy a Node.js application using this container, you need to copy the application files into the container and start the application when you start the container. The content of the Dockerfile is as follows: ``` # Basic image FROM node:10 # Set the working directory WORKDIR /usr/src/app # Copy the package.json and package-lock.json files to the working directory, and execute npm to install COPY package*. json ./ RUN npm install # Copy the local project file to the container COPY . . # Expose port 8080 in the container EXPOSE 8080 # Start the application CMD [ "npm", "start" ] ```
