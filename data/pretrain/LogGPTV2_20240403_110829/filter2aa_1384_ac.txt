### My Commitment to You

My commitment to you, the reader, is straightforward. If you are tasked with performing a real network penetration test on a network with hundreds or even thousands of computer systems, and if the scope of the engagement aligns with what I will later describe as a "typical" Internal Network Penetration Test (INPT), you can successfully meet the requirements of that engagement by following the steps outlined in this book—even if you have never conducted a penetration test before.

If you are an experienced hacker or ethical hacker reading this for personal interest, you might wonder about topics such as wireless attacks, antivirus bypass, and buffer overflows. In the professional world of adversarial emulation services, companies hire individuals to perform scoped engagements. The no-holds-barred, anything-goes approach, while exciting, rarely (if ever) occurs in a professional setting.

This book is not a broad overview of every topic related to ethical hacking; instead, it is a comprehensive, start-to-finish manual for conducting an entire INPT. It provides everything you need to be successful in the most common type of engagement you will encounter in a career in professional penetration testing.

By the time you finish reading this book and working through the lab exercises, you will have developed a skill set that commands six-figure salaries for entry-level positions. Other books in this field often cover too broad a spectrum, devoting only a single chapter to each topic. In contrast, this book focuses laser-sharp on a single task: taking over an enterprise network. I hope you are ready, because you will learn a lot, and I think you will be surprised by what you can achieve by the end of the last chapter. Good luck!

### About This Book

**The Art of Network Penetration Testing** is a complete walkthrough of a typical internal network penetration test (INPT). The book covers a step-by-step methodology that the author has used to conduct hundreds of INPTs for companies of all sizes. It serves less as a conceptual introduction to theories and ideas and more as a practical manual that readers with little or no experience can use to guide them through an entire engagement.

#### Who Should Read This Book

This book is primarily written for aspiring penetration testers and ethical hackers. However, anyone involved in the design, development, or implementation of systems, applications, and infrastructure should find this book valuable.

#### How This Book Is Organized: A Roadmap

The book is divided into four parts, each corresponding to one of the four phases of a typical INPT. It should be read sequentially, as each phase builds on the outputs from the previous phase.

- **Phase 1: Information Gathering**
  - **Chapter 2:** Discovering network hosts within a given IP address range.
  - **Chapter 3:** Enumerating network services listening on discovered hosts.
  - **Chapter 4:** Identifying authentication, configuration, and patching vulnerabilities in network services.

- **Phase 2: Focused Penetration**
  - **Chapter 5:** Compromising vulnerable web applications (Jenkins and Apache Tomcat).
  - **Chapter 6:** Attacking and penetrating a vulnerable database server.
  - **Chapter 7:** Exploiting missing Microsoft Security Updates and using Metasploit meterpreter payloads.

- **Phase 3: Post-Exploitation**
  - **Chapter 8:** Post-exploitation techniques for Windows-based systems.
  - **Chapter 9:** Post-exploitation techniques for Linux/UNIX targets.
  - **Chapter 10:** Elevating to domain admin privileges and extracting sensitive data from a Windows Domain controller.

- **Phase 4: Cleanup and Documentation**
  - **Chapter 11:** Removing unnecessary artifacts from testing activities.
  - **Chapter 12:** Creating a solid pentest deliverable.

Experienced penetration testers may prefer to jump to specific sections, but new readers should follow the chapters sequentially.

#### About the Code

This book includes a significant amount of command-line output, both in numbered listings and inline with the text. Source code is formatted in a fixed-width font to distinguish it from regular text. The code examples are available for download from the Manning website and GitHub.

### About the Author

**Royce Davis** is a professional hacker specializing in network penetration testing and enterprise adversarial attack emulation. With over a decade of experience, he has helped clients secure their network environments and presented research, techniques, and tools at security conferences across the United States. He has contributed to open-source security testing tools and frameworks and is the co-founder of PentestGeek.com, an online resource for ethical hacking training and education.

### About the Cover Illustration

The cover illustration, titled "Habit d’un Morlaque d’Uglin en Croatie" or "Clothing of a Morlaque man from the island of Ugljan, in Croatia," is from a collection of dress costumes from various countries by Jacques Grasset de Saint-Sauveur (1757–1810). The rich variety of these illustrations reminds us of the cultural diversity of the past, which has largely faded in today's globalized world. Manning celebrates this historical diversity with book covers based on Grasset de Saint-Sauveur’s pictures, highlighting the inventiveness and initiative of the computer business.

### Chapter 1: Network Penetration Testing

In today's digital age, almost everything exists within networked computer systems in the cloud. From tax returns to GPS locations, our data is stored and accessible, making it a prime target for dedicated and skilled attackers.

#### Corporate Data Breaches

If you haven't been living under a rock, you've likely heard about corporate data breaches. According to the Breach Level Index, there were 943 disclosed breaches in the first half of 2018 alone. These breaches often follow a similar pattern: a company discloses that an unknown number of confidential customer records have been stolen by malicious hackers, leading to a drop in stock prices, public outrage, and the firing of key executives.

#### How Hackers Break In

Why do these breaches happen so frequently? The truth is that the deck is stacked in favor of cyber-attackers. Enterprises have many more connected devices than employees, significantly increasing their attack surface.

- **The Defender Role:** Defenders must identify and secure every device on the network, apply patches, and ensure strong passwords. This is a daunting and continuous task.
- **The Attacker Role:** Attackers only need to find one vulnerability—such as a missed patch or a default password—to gain unauthorized access. New systems are often deployed quickly, leaving potential security gaps.

#### Adversarial Attack Simulation: Penetration Testing

One effective way for companies to identify security weaknesses is to hire a professional penetration tester to simulate an attack. The specific scope and execution of a penetration test can vary, but the most common type is the Internal Network Penetration Test (INPT), which simulates the threat of a malicious insider.

- **Typical INPT Workflow:**
  - **Phase 1: Information Gathering**
    - Map out the network.
    - Identify possible targets.
