User: Brand new to web design, using python.  Got Apache up and running, test python script working in cgi-bin directory.  Get valid results when I type in the URL explicitly:  ".../cgi-bin/showenv.py"
But I don't want the URL to look that way.  Here at stackoverflow, for example, the URLs that display in my address bar never have the messy details showing the script that was used to run them.  They're clean of cgi-bin, .py, etc. extensions.  How do I do that?
EDIT: Thanks for responses, every single one helpful, lots to learn.  I'm going with URL Rewriting for now; example in the docs looks extremely close to what I actually want to do.  But I'm committed to python, so will have to look at WSGI down the road.
Assistant: Just use some good web framework e.g. django and you can have such URLs
more than URLs you will have a better infrastructure, templates, db orm etc
