As a newcomer to web design using Python, I have successfully set up Apache and have a test Python script running in the `cgi-bin` directory. When I explicitly type the URL (e.g., `.../cgi-bin/showenv.py`), I get valid results. However, I would prefer the URL to be more user-friendly and not display the `cgi-bin` directory or the `.py` extension. For example, on websites like Stack Overflow, the URLs in the address bar are clean and do not reveal the underlying scripts.

**How can I achieve this?**

**Update:**
Thank you for all the helpful responses. There is a lot to learn, and for now, I am going with URL rewriting. The examples in the documentation seem very close to what I need. However, since I am committed to using Python, I will also look into WSGI in the future.

**Response:**
Using a robust web framework like Django can help you achieve clean and user-friendly URLs. Not only will it provide better URL management, but it will also offer a more comprehensive infrastructure, including templates, database ORM, and other essential features. 

For your current setup, URL rewriting is a good start. You can use Apache's `mod_rewrite` module to create cleaner URLs. Hereâ€™s a basic example of how you can set up URL rewriting in your `.htaccess` file:

```apache
RewriteEngine On
RewriteRule ^my-clean-url$ /cgi-bin/showenv.py [L]
```

This rule will map `http://yourdomain.com/my-clean-url` to `http://yourdomain.com/cgi-bin/showenv.py`.

In the long term, transitioning to a framework like Django will provide more flexibility and maintainability. Django's URL dispatcher allows you to define URL patterns and map them to views, making it easy to create clean and descriptive URLs.
