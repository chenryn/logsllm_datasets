I noted when trying to diagnose BATCH-1852 (which was making use of
JdbcTemplate) that there were no options to enable logging JDBC query
parameters or query results. I recalled this was possible for Hibernate (see
http://www.seamframework.org/Documentation/EnablingJDBCBindParameterLoggingWithHibernateAndLog4j)
and wanted the same feature for Spring JdbcTemplate. I could have used P6Spy
(see http://sourceforge.net/projects/p6spy/), although that approach seemed
inconvenient.
As this logging can be very verbose I used separate classes (and thus
loggers). Continue to set logger "org.springframework.jdbc.core.JdbcTemplate"
to debug to see the queries being executed and simple results. Additionally
set logger "org.springframework.jdbc.core.PreparedStatementValueLogger" to
debug for query parameter logging and logger
"org.springframework.jdbc.core.PreparedStatementResultLogger" to debug for
further query result logging.
I've implemented the change in a style that will hopefully be seen to fit and
I'll issue a pull request as soon as I've completed testing and committed to
my spring-framework fork. I'm happy to make further changes for this issue if
necessary. Please let me know.
