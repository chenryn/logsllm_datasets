**David Thexton** has opened **SPR-9405** and provided the following comments:

While diagnosing **BATCH-1852** (which utilized **JdbcTemplate**), I observed that there were no options available for logging JDBC query parameters or results. I recalled that this functionality was possible with Hibernate, as documented [here](http://www.seamframework.org/Documentation/EnablingJDBCBindParameterLoggingWithHibernateAndLog4j), and I desired a similar feature for **Spring JdbcTemplate**. Although **P6Spy** (referenced [here](http://sourceforge.net/projects/p6spy/)) could have been used, it seemed inconvenient.

To address this, I created separate classes (and thus loggers) to manage the potentially verbose logging. To view the queries being executed and their simple results, set the logger `org.springframework.jdbc.core.JdbcTemplate` to `DEBUG`. For logging of query parameters, set the logger `org.springframework.jdbc.core.PreparedStatementValueLogger` to `DEBUG`. Additionally, for more detailed query result logging, set the logger `org.springframework.jdbc.core.PreparedStatementResultLogger` to `DEBUG`.

I have implemented these changes in a manner that I hope will integrate seamlessly. I will submit a pull request once I have completed testing and committed the changes to my fork of the **spring-framework** repository. I am open to making any further adjustments as needed. Please provide feedback if you have any suggestions or concerns.
