A DETAILS OF ITERATIVE ATTACK
The attacker essentially has access to an oracle of the Deep Archi-
tecture, where the attacker can provide arbitrary (cid:174)𝑥 features and
gets the individual values of the reconstruction error vector (cid:174)𝑒. The

attacker then computes max𝑖 (cid:174)𝑒 and finds the sensor reading 𝑟𝑖 with
the highest reconstruction error from (cid:174)𝑥. In order to satisfy 𝜀( (cid:174)𝑒′)  𝜀((cid:174)𝑒′) > 𝜃.
B DEFINITION OF CONSTRAINTS
In order to study the impact of this best-case constraints, we selected
𝑘 features for every attack that can be modified. Then we studied
how replay, iterative, and learning based attacks perform when
these constraint are applied. We defined the constrains as follows:
starting from the results of iterative and learning based attacks we
determined the 𝑘 features that were changed most frequently (over
the course of each attack). The intuition behind this is as follows:
features that are modified most often in the unconstrained case
are assumed to have the highest impact on the performance of the
attack. We are assuming a best case scenario for the attacker, in
which she was able to choose the 𝑘 our of 𝑛 features to maximise
her efficiency. Then, we created 11 sets of 𝑘 features that can be
