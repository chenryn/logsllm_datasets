Maybe its time to support stylus https://github.com/LearnBoost/stylus
Many users like me use stylus in projects and they want to have bootstrap
stylus in project
Everyone know why stylus is much better of less
You maybe use less only for simple mixins/variables But developers ...
We import bootstrap.styl and change config and ... and compile prefix free
with nib and ....
Ee have 3 choose
  1. Complete rewrite less files in stylus and don't support less any more, its can be fast as posible, there is good repo in github that converted bootstrap to stylus.
  2. Support stylus too, maybe new brach or something else and continue backward compatibility.
  3. Create new project in twitter org and developers can update it as a separate process.  
and you don't need to think about it, we keep it update.  
and some day you see it will be much popular.
@fat @mdo I hope you more thinking about this request before close
immediately.
