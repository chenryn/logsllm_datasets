### Issue Description
I am unable to start Superset in Docker using the latest master branch (commit: `ff6773df4ed7d3baca15f19baf30a793b4fce248`).

### Expected Results
The `docker-init.sh` script should run without errors.

### Working Command
When I checkout to commit `300c4ecb0f6798e5901dcb88a034c53e708ff0b4`, the following command works as expected:
```sh
docker-compose run --rm superset ./docker-init.sh
```

### Output of the Working Command
```sh
Starting superset_redis_1    ... done
Starting superset_postgres_1 ... done
+ '[' 1 -ne 0 ']'
+ exec ./docker-init.sh
+ export FLASK_APP=superset:app
+ FLASK_APP=superset:app

### Summary
The `docker-init.sh` script runs successfully and completes the database upgrade when using commit `300c4ecb0f6798e5901dcb88a034c53e708ff0b4`. However, it fails with the latest master branch (commit: `ff6773df4ed7d3baca15f19baf30a793b4fce248`). The expected result is that the `docker-init.sh` script should not error out.
