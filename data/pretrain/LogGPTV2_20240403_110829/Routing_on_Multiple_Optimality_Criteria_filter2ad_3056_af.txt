promise choice between the route length and risk expo-
sure, which chooses to go through some metropolitan
areas and avoid some others. In many cases, this small
set of nondominated solutions may be sufﬁcient to con-
vey to the decision maker a good evaluation. Such a re-
sult demonstrates the parametric method’s capability of
providing diverse choices in a very efﬁcient manner for
multiobjective decision making.
Subsequent solutions do increase our knowledge
about the distribution of nondominated solutions, but
most of them may merely represent a lower level of
deviations from those representative solutions, because
they are generated from some conﬁned feasible region
between previously generated nondominated solutions.
After a certain number of iterations, newly generated
nondominated solutions may be marginally different
from some previous solutions. As shown in Figures 7
and 8, the next six solutions (i.e., the 7th–12th solutions)
92
Xie & Waller
generated by the parametric search process seem to be
more or less analogous to their previous counterparts.
For example, Path 9 is only slightly different from Path
2 on a few road segments between Newark and New
York City, and Path 10 and Path 11 are both very close
to Path 6, where the only difference between Path 10
and Path 6 is a short section from Massachusetts to New
Hampshire and the road segments distinguishing Path
11 and Path 6 only appear from Allenton to Scranton,
Pennsylvania. From a practical point of view, incorpo-
rating these new solutions may only add marginal value
in providing more insights for ﬁnal decision making.
3.2.3 Triobjective routing case. First, we compared the
complete nondominated solution sets of the biobjec-
tive and triobjective problem instances (generated by
the labeling method). In this particular study, the biob-
jective problem generates 39 nondominated solutions,
while the triobjective problem generates 40 solutions.
It is found that the biobjective case with the combi-
nation of accident rate and population size performs
as a very good approximate to the original triobjective
problem—34 of 40 nondominated solutions of the triob-
jective problem exist in the solution set of the biobjec-
tive problem, which cover all those example representa-
tive nondominated solutions we showed above.
Then, for the triobjective problem instance, we ap-
plied the decomposition scheme with the biobjective
constrained parametric method for its nondominated
solutions. Meanwhile, a triobjective labeling method
extended from Brumbaugh-Smith and Shier’s (18) is
also implemented for the complete solution set. The
nondominated solutions of the three biobjective sub-
problems are assembled in Table 2: the route length-
population size subproblem (the 1st column), the ac-
cident rate-population size subproblem (the 2nd col-
umn), and the route length-accident rate subproblem
(the 3rd column), which generate 27, 5, and 10 solutions,
respectively. As an illustration, the nondominated solu-
tion proﬁles of the three biobjective subproblems are
also depicted in Figure 9, which shows a close match of
the search results between the constrained parametric
method and the label-correcting method. A synthesis
of these nondominated solutions results in a union set
of 34 nondominated solutions for the triobjective prob-
lem (the 4th column in Table 2), which accounts for a
solution identiﬁcation rate of 85% (i.e., 34 out of 40).
This rate is considerably higher than that from the
aforementioned biobjective problem instance, 76.9%
(i.e., 30 out of 39).

ing problem. The proposed constrained parametric
method differs from existing methods in the literature:
(1) compared to parametric methods, it can identify
both extreme and nonextreme nondominated paths;
(2) compared to labeling methods, it performs in a
polynomial-time manner and prioritizes ﬁnding a set of
Optimal routing with multiple objectives

representative supporting solutions efﬁciently. This
latter feature makes it especially useful
in time-
constrained computing environments, such as real-time,
en route applications. In planning applications, it still
provides attractive computational beneﬁts, as the gener-
ation of the entire nondominated solution set is typically
not required in most of real-world, large-scale problems
(Current et al., 1990).
The reduced computational cost of the parametric
algorithm is due to the use of an approximate label-
setting procedure that solves the parameterized, dou-
bly constrained shortest path subproblem in polyno-
mial time. Although it may not guarantee the solution
completeness, the parametric algorithm is capable of
ﬁnding all extreme nondominated solutions and a large
part of nonextreme nondominated solutions. Extended
versions of the parametric algorithm may have greater
potential in more complex multiobjective routing prob-
lems, such as problems with stochastic, time-varying
attributes, alternative routing policies, and/or extra
routing restrictions. In these complex cases, the com-
binatorial complexity may be explosively higher than
their deterministic, static counterparts. The paramet-
ric optimization idea presented in this text should be
further explored for efﬁcient, practically implementable
solution methods that can characterize efﬁcient solution
sets of these more challenging problems in a prompt
manner.
