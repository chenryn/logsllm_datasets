# Environment
    Windows build number: [Win 10 1909 18363.900]
    PowerToys version: 0.19.1
    PowerToy module for which you are reporting the bug (if applicable): FancyZones
# Steps to reproduce
Long version:
  1. Open a Chromium based browser (I use Brave) and open a few tabs in a few separate windows.
  2. Right click on the icon in the taskbar and select "Close all windows"
  3. Open the browser again (it just opens a new tab according to my settings) then use the CTRL+SHIFT+T keyboard shortcut to re-open the closed tabs from the last session.
  4. This will open each of the separate windows with their tabs per press on the letter T.
  5. Now each of those windows (with a few tabs) will not be snapped into the zone their parent window (the one from step 3)
Short version :
  1. open a browser window
  2. snap it to a zone
  3. open a new window from the hamburger menu or SHIFT+click a link/bookmark
# Expected behavior
The newly created or re-opened browser windows (with tabs) should snap into
the zone that is assigned to the browser.
# Actual behavior
The newly created or re-opened browser windows (with tabs) are not snapped to
anything, they are just arranged close enough of their parent window
