### Anomaly Detection & Root Cause Analysis

#### Background & Motivation
Anomalies in system logs and traces can be early indicators of potential issues. Effective anomaly detection and root cause analysis (RCA) are crucial for maintaining system reliability and performance.

#### Description
1. **Semi-supervised Anomaly Detection:**
   - **Human-in-the-Loop Propagation:** Utilize human input to identify and propagate anomalies.
   - **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):** Develop RNNs, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), for anomaly detection.
   - **Topology Services:** Access topology services to enhance the detection process.

2. **Trace-Based RCA:**
   - **Deep Learning and Machine Learning:** Use LSTM, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and other ML techniques for trace analysis.
   - **Sequence Analysis:** Apply sequence alignment methods like Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) and Needleman-Wunsch for structural anomaly detection.

3. **Log Recommendation:**
   - **Multi-head Self-Attention Architecture:** Implement a deep learning model to improve log quality and provide recommendations.
   - **Log Instruction Extraction:** Extract and classify log instructions from source code to generate better log statements.

4. **Secure Operations:**
   - **Hybrid Approach:** Combine rule-based and ML/NLP techniques to evaluate and prevent operational risks.
   - **Large-Scale Deployment:** Deploy the secure operations system in multiple data centers to ensure high security and reliability.

#### Anticipated Impact
- **Improved Anomaly Detection:** Enhance the ability to detect and address anomalies in real-time.
- **Efficient RCA:** Provide faster and more accurate root cause analysis, reducing downtime and improving system reliability.
- **Better Log Quality:** Generate more informative and structured logs, aiding in automated solutions for anomaly detection and RCA.
- **Enhanced Security:** Reduce the risk of IT outages due to human error and improve the overall security posture of the system.

### Distributed Traces

#### Main Achievement
- **Improve Trace-Based RCA:** Achieve a 90% improvement in trace-based root cause analysis.

#### How It Works
1. **Learning:** For each service endpoint, learn the structure of the traces it generates.
2. **Modeling:** Aggregate all traces into a behavior model.
3. **Anomaly Detection:** Compare new traces with the behavior model to detect anomalies.
4. **Root-Cause Analysis:** When an anomaly is detected, use advanced ML and statistical approaches to identify the root cause.

### Log Recommendation

#### Approach
- **Better Logs for Anomaly Detection:** Improve log quality to enhance anomaly detection and root-cause analysis.
- **Evaluation and Recommendation:** Train the model on log messages from top-ranked GitHub repositories and provide recommendations for better log statements.

#### How It Works
- **Lack of Log Quality:** Poor log quality leads to inefficiencies in troubleshooting faults.
- **Automated Solutions:** QuLog enables the generation of better log statements, which is essential for automated anomaly detection and RCA.

### Secure Operations

#### Problem
- **Human Error:** Human errors are a leading cause of costly IT outages and service failures.
- **Complexity:** Estimating operation risk and preventing service interruptions is challenging due to the large surface area and lack of parameter specification of APIs.

#### Innovation
- **Deep Learning Algorithms:** Exploit modern deep learning algorithms to support secure operations.
- **Security Requirements:** Develop methods to address new security requirements without significant changes to existing deployments.

#### Path Forward
- **New Security Requirements:** Address the security needs of large-scale public cloud platforms.
- **Rule Management:** Implement rule management to handle complex API protection.
