User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Trying to find bottleneck... 60k onsite visitors I know this will be hard, but I'm willing to try the Q&amp;A route.

I have a Wordpress site that currently has 60,000 visitors on the site at once.

I'm using an EC2 m3.xlarge, php/php-fpm 5.5.10, nginx 1.4.7, php-apc.

For caching plugin I'm using WP-Super-Cache.

I'm noticing a very slow response time, lots of 502 errors, plus... I have tons of errors like these in my nginx log:

10319#0: *57132 connect() to unix:/tmp/php5-fpm.sock failed (11: Resource temporarily unavailable) while connecting to upstream

I'm confused what the heck the bottle neck is...


I have 4 CPU cores, each at about ~15%... total load avg of .85-1 constant
~4GB used of 16GB
RDS at 60% CPU usage, low latency for reads and writes


For my settings... ive basically exhausted all my knowledge + hours of googling...


100 max_children for php-fpm
4096 for backlog &amp; somaxconn
nginx: worker_rlimit_nofile  200000
nginx: worker_processes  8
nginx: worker_connections  32768


I don't know if some of these are too high or low, I've tried to tweak it to the best of my ability... 

I don't even really know how to find the problem either. When I look through slow log it's just a lot of random stuff probably because everything is going slow... not just one thing.

Assistant: Some monitoring and graphing tool would be useful to pinpoint the location of bottleneck. We use http://munin-monitoring.org/  Munin grabs stats from most of known services plus system metrics and it works almost out-of-the-box on modern distros.
