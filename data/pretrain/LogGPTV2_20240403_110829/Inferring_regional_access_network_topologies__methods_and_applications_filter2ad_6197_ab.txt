approach to infer failure groups in the last-mile layer-1 network
topologies—i.e., devices such as repeaters whose failure impact
downstream modem connectivity through topological dependen-
cies. In 2011, motivated by the incompleteness and methodological
limitations of traceroute-based maps at the time, Knight et al. con-
structed the Internet Topology Zoo, parsing information that net-
work operators published on their websites; the majority of their
maps are at the PoP level (where a network interconnects with
other networks) and half are research and education networks [34].
PoP-level maps are not sufficiently granular to study aggregation
structures in access networks. Beginning in 2015, a growing body of
research investigated the physical infrastructure behind networks,
especially focused on fiber [21, 42], the frequency and impact of
fiber cuts [25], and the impact of fiber deployment on end-to-end
latency [9]. In this work, we map the router-level aggregation struc-
ture of access networks.
Broadband Networks: Substantial work analyzed broadband
networks by sending probe packets to user’s gateway [18], de-
ploying home routers or embedded devices with measurement
scripts [3, 10, 67], embedding measurements into BitTorrent soft-
ware [57], and crowdsourcing measurements to end-users [35, 51].
This work illuminated characteristics (e.g., latency, packet loss rate,
throughput, and uptime) of the end-to-end [8, 13, 65] and last-mile
[7, 24, 66] performance of residential broadband networks without
understanding the logical and physical topologies of the access
network. This paper leverages the aggregation structure that we
discovered to understand the latency observed by end-users.
Mapping Mobile Networks: Previous work studied the geo-
graphic coverage of mobile regional networks using the correlation
between IP prefixes and location [79] and locating the PoP used
by mobile devices in traceroutes [81]. However, these analyses
were performed on 3G networks, and do not reveal the underly-
ing access network infrastructure that produces these behaviors.
An extensive body of wireless network measurement research has
investigated the behavior of network elements unique to wire-
less – everything from the end-user devices to the mobile-specific
middleboxes [2, 14, 22, 36, 49, 71, 76–78]. Connectivity factors
can also impede performance of mobile ISPs, e.g., legacy hierar-
chical routing [20], lack of direct interconnection with content
providers [81], peering strategies between mobile virtual network
operators (MVNOs) and the underlying network infrastructure [61],
and poor selection of DNS servers [55, 82]. In this work we deter-
mine the sources of latency limitations in today’s mobile networks,
and if those limitations can be overcome by moving services into
access network infrastructure. We also reveal new hints in IPv6
addresses of reveal the region, packet gateway, and CO serving a
mobile carrier.
4 METHODOLOGY OVERVIEW
Broadly, our topology mapping methods require the ISPs to allow
the following measurements of their access networks:
Traceroute: We need the ability to observe routers in each CO
with traceroute to uncover access network topology. This is straight
forward when the network uses IP routing; if the network uses
MPLS to organize routing between COs, then our method requires
the ability to observe routers in each CO using traceroute torwards
exit routers, using the method in [72]. For wired access networks,
we prune a small number of links because traceroute can produce
false links. Our pruning assumes the access network has a ring/star
topology (§2.1). Although we can not validate this assumption for all
ISPs we study—ISPs rarely publish information about their internal
topology—we found support for the use of ring/star topologies
in access networks from Comcast [74], Deutsche Telekom [27],
Cisco [30], and Juniper [48].
Alias Resolution: To accurately map IPs to routers, we require
the ability to resolve aliases using active probing (e.g., with Merca-
tor [26] and MIDAR [33]).
Reverse DNS or Structured Addressing: To accurately map
routers to COs, we either require the operator to ether label some
of their router IPs with hostnames in their reverse DNS (rDNS), or
they must have clear structure in their router address space that
corresponds to the structure of their access network.
How general is our approach? The remainder of this paper (§5,
§6, §7) studies six different U.S. access networks – Comcast and
Charter (wired), AT&T (wired and mobile), Verizon (mobile), and
T-Mobile (mobile). We believe our method can be extended to other
access networks outside of the U.S.; for example, China’s top three
providers have been shown to provide the measurements we need
for topology mapping [69]. Also, Bell Canada and Shaw Commu-
nications Canada appear to provide the necessary measurement
primitives for our method [38]. However, there are classes of ac-
cess network where our method will not work. Primarily, these
are where traceroute does not observe routers in COs. This is com-
mon in countries where the access and retail functions of ISPs are
separated; examples of these are New Zealand’s UFB [16] and Aus-
tralia’s NBN [46]. In these scenarios, the access provider tunnels
subscriber traffic to hand-over points where the retail provider
is co-located, which might be in entirely different cities, so the
aggregation structure in the access network is invisible.
5 CASE STUDY: COMCAST AND CHARTER
Our first case study focuses on two networks amenable to external
traceroute-style measurements that also provide CO information
in their rDNS. We focus on Comcast and the former Time Warner
regional networks acquired by Charter—the largest cable Inter-
net providers in the U.S.—networks that typically include router,
building, and network information in their rDNS. Fig. 5a shows a
traceroute into Charter’s Southern California region. The rDNS for
hop 13 ends with tbone.rr.com, indicating a BackboneCO. Each
subsequent hop includes an rDNS tag for the regional network
socal, showing the transition from Charter’s backbone into the re-
gional network. Each rDNS name includes a portion of a CLLI code

Beaverton, OR region, using CO locations rather than CLLIs.
Similar to many backbone point-of-presence (PoP) rDNS labels,
the regional CO tags indicate the location of the carrier offices (COs).
In Charter, the CLLI codes uniquely identify a specific building.
Comcast sometimes uses the street address for a CO, but more
commonly uses neighborhood, or city, names that provide a general
geographic location, along with the U.S. state. Inspired by other
tools that extract information from rDNS [12, 29, 38, 45], we hand-
crafted regular expressions (regexes) to map these CO addresses.
Our methodology for these types of networks—those with rDNS
and that can be externally probed—proceeded in two phases: (1) build
and annotate CO-level topology graphs for these networks; (2) heuris-
tically refine the graphs to reflect the actual topology.
5.1 Phase 1: Build Router-Topology Graphs
This phase conducts traceroutes to reveal the CO interconnections
in each regional network. We conducted our probing from 47 van-
tage points (VPs) distributed throughout the United States in access,
cloud, and transit networks.
First, we tracerouted to an address in every /24 in each regional
network to expose at least one router from each EdgeCO. Second,
we tracerouted to every address with rDNS matching one of our
regexes to find CO interconnections missed in the first step. We
identified IP addresses with hostnames matching our regexes in the
Rapid7 rDNS dataset [53] which queries for PTR records for every
IPv4 address. Directly targeting CO router interfaces observed 5.3x
and 2.6x more CO interconnections than the /24 traceroutes for
Comcast and Charter, respectively, as some COs responded to the
/24 probing using addresses without rDNS. Third, we tracerouted
to every intermediate IP address observed in these traceroutes to
identify links that are entry and exit routers for an MPLS tun-
nel [72], allowing us to discard false edges between these COs. This
MPLS heuristic proved important in larger Charter regions, where
top level AggCOs appeared directly connected to nearly all Edge-
COs, which contradicted information about the Charter topology
in Maine that we recieved from a trusted source.
Finally, we used alias resolution (Mercator [26] and MIDAR [33])
to group IP addresses according to their router. We included all
IP addresses with rDNS matching our regexes, as well as all IP
addresses routed by each regional network. We annotated each
inferred router group with a CO tag, using the most common tag

extracted by our regexes using rDNS names for the router’s inter-
faces. If a router did not have a most common CO tag among the
rDNS for its interface addresses, we removed the CO mapping from
any address in the router group with rDNS, to avoid inconclusive
and potentially inaccurate mappings. We provide more details for
how we mapped IP addresses to COs in Appendix B.1.
5.2 Phase 2: Build CO-Topology Graphs
Using the CO mappings, we extract CO edges from traceroute paths,
where immediately adjacent routers in a path map to different COs,
and construct initial graphs of the topology for each region. The
rest of this phase processes the topology graphs to more accurately
reflect regional topologies. This phase (1) removes false inter-region
edges; (2) identifies the AggCOs; (3) removes false edges between
EdgeCOs; (4) adds missing edges from AggCOs to EdgeCOs; and
(5) infers the entry points into each region.
5.2.1 Remove False Inter-Region Edges. Large collections of tracer-
oute paths likely contain some random noise [63], so we discard all
edges that appear only in a single traceroute as anomalous. Next,
we remove edges that appear to interconnect COs in different re-
gions. While some links cross region boundaries (§5.2.5), many of
these links result from outdated rDNS that our alias resolution did
not catch. Further details are provided in Appendix B.2.
Identify AggCOs. Visually inspecting the regional graphs,
5.2.2
such as the graph in Fig. 6a, showed two features of interest. First,
they signaled a hierarchical structure (partially obscured by extra-
neous intra-region edges), where a few COs appeared responsible

for aggregating connectivity to the rest of the Internet for other
COs in the region. We devised a heuristic to distinguish AggCOs
from EdgeCOs based on the number of outgoing edges for each
CO in the graph. In each region, we infer AggCOs as those with a
higher out-degree than the average out-degree for that region plus
one standard deviation. This heuristic identified the two orange
COs in Fig. 6a, COs 1 and 2, as the AggCOs in this region.
Second, the graphs naturally grouped these AggCOs; when a
EdgeCO had more than one incoming edge, the two preceding
AggCOs had outgoing edges to nearly identical sets of EdgeCOs.
Topologically, this looks like a dual-star topology, with the im-
plication that each AggCO in a subregion directly connects with
every EdgeCO in the same subregion. The natural groupings also
provide new insights into the physical topology, indicating which
geographic regions rely on the same AggCOs, and the level of re-
dundancy to each EdgeCO. Appendix B.3 details how we identified
AggCOs, removed false edges, and added missing edges.
5.2.3 Remove False Edges between EdgeCOs. We knew that regional
networks use a ring to connect an AggCO to its EdgeCOs (§2), so the
star topology indicated that the fiber ring running from an AggCO
to its EdgeCOs bundles separate fiber pairs for each AggCO-to-
EdgeCO connection. These fiber pairs create two separate point-to-
point connections between an EdgeCO and its AggCOs, bypassing
all other EdgeCOs on the ring and eliminating the need to directly
connect EdgeCOs to other EdgeCOs. While the graph in Fig. 6a
shows that most EdgeCOs only connect to AggCOs, some appear
connected to other EdgeCOs, such as edges 9 → 12 and 3 → 4.
These edges from EdgeCOs likely result from uncorrected stale
rDNS, and we remove them to conform with a fiber ring (Fig. 6b).
5.2.4 Add Missing Edges From AggCOs to EdgeCOs. When an
EdgeCO lies along a fiber ring with one of the AggCOs, it will
connect directly with the other AggCO on the ring as well. Other-
wise, the fiber pairs would bypass the EdgeCO in only one direction.
We therefore assume that missing edges, e.g., from AggCO 1 to node
16 in Fig. 6a, likely result from missing rDNS.
Resolving missing edges first requires us to identify the AggCOs
on the same fiber rings. Our intuition is that AggCOs on the same
ring will directly connect with the same EdgeCOs, so we devised a
heuristic that looks for AggCOs that overlap at least 75% of their
connections with EdgeCOs, strongly suggesting that they aggregate
traffic on behalf of the same EdgeCOs. We then add edges to the
graph such that all AggCOs on the same last-mile fiber ring connect
to the same set of EdgeCOs. In Fig. 6b, we add the missing edge
from AggCO 1 to node 16.
Infer Entry Points Into Each Region. Finally, we add edges
5.2.5
back into the graph that cross regional network boundaries, such
as BackboneCO entry points and entry points from other nearby
regions, but only when overwhelming evidence implies their exis-
tence. Returning to the traceroute paths, we extract all triplets of the
form (co𝑖, region1) → (co𝑗 , region2) → (co𝑘, region2), where
co𝑖 and co𝑗 appear in consecutive hops, indicating they directly
connect. Given the hierarchical structure of the regional topologies,
we only include potential entry points when they appear to lead to
EdgeCOs in the region. To avoid misinterpretations caused by stale

rDNS, we only include an entry point if we observe it leading to
two or more COs in the same region.
Our analysis reveals that all regions in Charter, and all but three
of the Comcast regions, connect to at least two BackboneCOs. A
Comcast network operator told us that nearly every Comcast re-
gion directly connects to two BackboneCOs, so we likely missed
three entry points in addition to the 57 backbone entry points we
observed across the Comcast regions. In some regions we observe
backbone connections and a direct connection to another region;
e.g, the Central California region in Comcast appears to connect to
two BackboneCOs and the San Francisco regional network. We did
not observe direct inter-region connections in Charter.
5.3 Contrasting Comcast and Charter
The key difference between Comcast and Charter is the number of
regions they use, impacting the size of the regions and the extent of
the aggregation inside each region. We observed only six Charter
regions compared to 28 Comcast regions, but the Charter regions
