User: I know you can view the currently queued and running tasks in the Dashboard or development server console. However, is there any way to get that list programmatically? The docs only describe how to add tasks to the queue, but not how to list and/or cancel them.
In python please.
Assistant: A workaround, since they don't seem to support this yet, would be to model a Task datastore object. Create one on task queue add, update it when running, and delete it when your task fires. This can also be a nice way to get around the payload limits of the task queue api.
