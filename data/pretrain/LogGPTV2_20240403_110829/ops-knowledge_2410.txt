As a newcomer to Oozie, I've encountered a couple of issues that I needed help with. After some troubleshooting, I have found solutions to both problems:

1) **Embedding a Pig Action with Python UDFs in Oozie:**
   - Initially, I placed the `jython.jar` file in the library path and included an import statement in my Pig script to use the Python UDFs. However, the `.py` file was not being recognized.
   - **Solution:** To resolve this, I moved the Python file into the Oozie workflow directory and referenced it from there. This adjustment allowed the Python UDFs to be correctly identified and utilized within the Pig action.

2) **Integrating Pig with Cassandra in Oozie:**
   - I was able to successfully execute a basic transformation on data retrieved from Cassandra using CQL via the Pig CLI. Unfortunately, the same process did not work when executed through Oozie.
   - **Solution:** The issue was resolved by adding the necessary Cassandra JAR files to the `lib` folder located in the Oozie's HDFS path. This ensured that all required dependencies were available for the Pig-Cassandra integration during the Oozie job execution.

I hope these solutions can assist others facing similar challenges.
