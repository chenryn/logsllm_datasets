3.3 Degree correlation
The degree correlation shows the individual’s propensity to con-
nect to nodes with similar degrees. The term assortative mixing
stands for the situation that a person is likely to be connected to
other people with similar degrees, and the term disassortative mix-
ing stands for the opposite. It is known that most real-world net-
works exhibit the disassortative mixing, while the human social
networks exhibit the assortative mixing. The mixing pattern can be
quantiﬁed by the assortativity, which is deﬁned as follows [31,32]:
M−1P

where M is the number of links and ji and ki are the degrees of
two nodes connected to edge i.
Besides the assortativity, a plot of degree correlation discloses
more details. The degree correlation is the ratio of the degree of a
user over the mean degree of one’s neighbors, and we denote it as
knn,i for node i. Normally, the quantity knn(k) is calculated by
averaging the degree correlations of all the nodes of degree k. The
degree correlation is shown in the Figure 8.
The Cyworld friends network exhibits the assortativity value of
−0.13, but a close inspection on the degree correlation has shown
complex behaviors [2]. We report similarly complex behaviors in
degree correlation from the activity network. The assortativity of
the activity network is 0.0089. The bi-directional activity network
still has a glut of points spread out beyond the degree of 500 or
above, but the clear assortative mixing pattern between k = 30 to
500 shows up. The slight disassortative mixing or a negative trend
of knn(k) for k  500. Actually,
once k reaches 1000, kY (k) falls to 1, thus showing kY (k) ∼ 1.
This observation is actually counterintuitive. The distribution of
disparity in Figure 12 tells us that users with a smaller number of
correspondents tend to interact more with a subset of correspon-
dents, while users with a very large number or more than 1000 cor-
respondents actually spread their activity evenly across all of the
correspondents.
