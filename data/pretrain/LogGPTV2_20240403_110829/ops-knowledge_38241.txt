User: I installed both Python 2.7 and Python 2.6.5. I don't know what went wrong, but nothing related to Python seems to work any more. e.g. "setup.py install" for certain packages don't recognize the "install" parameter and other odd phenomena...
I would like to completely remove Python from my system.
I tried running the 2.7 and 2.6 msi files and choosing remove Python and then running only 2.6 and reinstalling it. Still stuff don't work.
How do I completely remove Python - from everything? (!)
I would not like to reinstall my entire machine just because of the Python install...
Assistant: If you still have the python installer on your PC, you can double-click on it (run it, it will open the installer window), and select the "Uninstall" option. It will uninstall that python version (if the installer is for Python3.9, then Python3.9 will be uninstalled, if it is for Python3.10, then that version...)
