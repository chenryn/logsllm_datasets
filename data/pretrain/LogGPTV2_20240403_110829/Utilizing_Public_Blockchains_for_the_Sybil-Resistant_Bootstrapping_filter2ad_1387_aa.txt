**Abstract:**
Distributed anonymity services, such as onion routing networks and cryptocurrency tumblers, promise privacy protection without relying on trusted third parties. While the security of these services is well-researched, the security implications of their bootstrapping processes are often overlooked. Users either jointly conduct the anonymization themselves or rely on a set of non-colluding privacy peers. However, the typically small number of privacy peers enables single adversaries to mimic distributed services. We present AnonBoot, a Sybil-resistant medium that securely bootstraps distributed anonymity services via public blockchains. AnonBoot enforces periodic proof-of-work (PoW) from peers to refresh their eligibility for providing secure anonymity services. A pseudo-random, locally replicable bootstrapping process using on-chain entropy prevents bias in the election of eligible peers. Our evaluation using Bitcoin as AnonBoot’s underlying blockchain demonstrates its feasibility in maintaining a trustworthy repository of 1,000 peers with a small storage footprint while supporting large user bases on most blockchains.

## 1 Introduction

Preserving user privacy on the Internet has become increasingly challenging due to pervasive online surveillance measures. The Snowden revelations highlighted that every online user's privacy is at risk [23]. This shift has fueled the adoption of distributed anonymity services, such as message shuffling networks [13], anonymous communication networks based on onion routing [16], and cryptocurrency tumblers [31, 54, 55]. While many works have focused on the secure building blocks of anonymity services, they often overlook the bootstrapping process. Typically, these works assume non-colluding peers, but this assumption does not always hold, as evidenced by numerous scams in cryptocurrencies [2, 49, 55] and the need for manual reporting [45] or active probing [12, 50] of bad peers in the Tor network. Therefore, the question remains: How can we securely bootstrap distributed anonymity services without relying on operator reputation?

In this paper, we propose AnonBoot, a medium for securely bootstrapping anonymity services using public blockchains. AnonBoot leverages a public host blockchain to maintain an immutable and transparent event log. Peers join by periodically publishing advertisements containing a small proof of work (PoW) to the host blockchain. This ensures that peer operators must periodically invest hardware resources to refresh their membership within a limited time frame. All participants can locally derive AnonBoot’s state by monitoring the host blockchain, creating a Sybil-resistant index of privacy peers. Users can then request bootstrapping new anonymity services from this index, catering to their individual privacy requirements. We build AnonBoot on top of Bitcoin to demonstrate its low resource requirements and small storage footprint, and to show that it does not require sophisticated blockchain features like smart contracts.

**Contributions:**
- We identify a lack of secure bootstrapping for existing anonymity services (Section 2).
- Through AnonBoot, we demonstrate that public blockchains can create a secure bootstrapping process for various use cases (Section 4).
- We show that PoW and peer election can prevent adversaries from gaining advantages over honest peer operators (Section 6).
- AnonBoot scales to repositories of 1,000 privacy peers and large user bases with minimal storage impact on the host blockchain and low, tunable costs for participants (Section 7).

## 2 Available Anonymity Services

We categorize distributed anonymity services into three main types: Internet anonymity networks, message shuffling networks, and cryptocurrency tumblers.

### 2.1 Anonymity Networks

Anonymity networks, such as Tor [16], enable low-latency and anonymous Internet communication through onion routing. Traffic is tunneled through a user-selected circuit under layered encryption, as shown in Figure 2a. Users create circuits locally at random, considering performance metrics and node-specific policies. Tor provides the necessary information through a directory maintained by trusted directory servers [16]. These servers, currently ten [44], are vetted by the Tor project maintainers, and users must trust that they do not collude [36]. To increase reliability, relays are actively probed [12, 50], and users can report misbehavior [45]. Misbehaving nodes are flagged in the directory to help users avoid them [45].

**Takeaway:**
Tor relies on an index of available nodes and their properties, requiring trusted authorities to maintain this index.

### 2.2 Message Shuffling Networks

Message shuffling networks, introduced by David Chaum [13], provide sender anonymity for applications like whistleblowing. As shown in Figure 2b, users relay messages through a cascade of known shufflers after encrypting them in layers. Multiple users shuffle their messages through the same cascade, reducing overhead. Each shuffler decrypts the outermost layer, shuffles the batch, and forwards it to the next shuffler. As long as one shuffler remains honest, no passive adversary can deanonymize the users. However, shuffling networks are prone to active attacks, such as denial of service (DoS) or message replacement [14]. Adversaries can easily operate full shuffling networks at low costs due to their fixed and small size.

**Takeaway:**
Users must trust that non-colluding operators run the shuffling network faithfully, which is challenging due to the lack of a widely accepted index of shuffling networks.

### 2.3 Cryptocurrency Tumblers

Cryptocurrency tumblers, or cryptotumblers, break the linkability between privacy-aware users and their funds to counteract curious blockchain observers. Cryptotumblers pool funds from multiple users and pay out random coins of the same value, making the new coin owners unknown to blockchain observers. 

First-generation centralized cryptotumblers required strong trust in the service operator, leading to several alleged scams [2, 49, 55]. Distributed cryptotumblers, such as MÃűbius [31] and CoinParty [54, 55], aim to provide a more secure alternative. MÃűbius uses Ethereum smart contracts, while CoinParty implements a blockchain-external service via a shuffling network and secure multiparty computation (SMC). Threshold signatures and secret-shared checksums in CoinParty prevent single adversaries from stealing funds and hold misbehaving mixing peers accountable. However, SMC can only tolerate adversaries controlling less than one-third of the service’s privacy peers [4].

**Takeaway:**
Although distributed cryptotumblers can enhance privacy, they either rely on smart contracts or are prone to Sybil attacks. Providing a technical medium to securely bootstrap cryptotumblers remains an open problem [39].

## 3 Scenario and Design Goals

Based on the current landscape of anonymity services and the lack of proper bootstrapping processes, we specify our scenario and design goals.

### 3.1 Generalization of Anonymity Services

We derive our scenario from the diverse landscape of existing services. We assume a group of privacy-aware users who seek to utilize an anonymity service to increase their privacy. To ensure security and privacy, multiple independent operators of privacy peers must jointly offer distributed anonymity services. Due to the limited scalability of existing services, we assume that only a few privacy peers (e.g., < 100) provide services to much larger user groups, making them prone to Sybil attacks.

To support local user decisions, such as creating Tor circuits or ensuring a minimum number of independent peers, users need a secure way to discover available peers and established anonymity services. They must also establish trust in the setup of these services, even if they do not know the peer operators. The service discovery must allow pooling users' anonymization efforts, as required for shuffling networks and cryptotumblers. Additionally, we need to incentivize maintaining an honest majority of privacy peers, although we assume that some will act maliciously, aiming to deanonymize users, stall the service, or inflict other damages.

**Conclusion:**
Users need assurance that they only utilize distributed anonymity services with a majority of honest peers. The setup and discovery of such services currently constitute weak points that adversaries could exploit to infiltrate anonymity services.
