published (or looked for) at the end node.
Since two or more random walks may end in the same
node, then for a quorum size of k, we may need more than
k RWs. However, for similar arguments as in the birthday
paradox, as long as the quorum size is at most 0 (vn), the
chance of such collisions are very small. Hence, no more
than O(vn) RWs are needed (for a more precise analysis re(cid:173)
fer to [5]). Using the analysis of [5] of the mixing time of
a MD RW in ad hoc networks, each of these RWs should be
started with TIL=n/2. Thus, the total communication com(cid:173)
plexity of accessing a quorum of size 8 (vn) in this way is
8(nvn). Yet, here we never invoke routing.
PATH access strategy. Another way to pick a quorum is
by performing a single RW, which traverses the underlying
network graph for a sufficient number of steps to cover IQI
different nodes. Naturally, this number should be set such as
to guarantee the intersection property of the quorum system.
The number of steps that it takes for a simple RW to visit i
different nodes is called the partial cover time of i nodes and
is denoted by PCT(i) (for a given graph). It is already known
that for Random Geometric Graphs PCT(n/2) :::; O(n) [3]
and the full cover time is PCT(n) == O(nlogn) [4]. How(cid:173)
ever, PCT(i) for i  1, if r 2 2:: c81~(n), then w.h.p. for
G2 (n,r) PCT(Rvn) == 8(vn),for constant R.
We have validated Conjecture 4.1 empirically. Figure 2 de(cid:173)
picts simulation results for the number of unique nodes visited
by a single RW (and UNIQUE-PATH RW explained below),
for different network and quorum sizes.
In these runs, per(cid:173)
formed on the same setting as reported in Section 7, we run
a RW with a given TIL and count the number of different
visited nodes (averaging across multiple RWs and runs). For
example, with n == 800, in order to visit J805 == 28 nodes, a
simple random has a length of 45, thus PCT( vn) == 1.6vn.
When implementing lookup operations PATH quorums
have the following advantage: whenever the searched data has
indeed been published, the RW is likely to find the advertise(cid:173)
ment before the TTL expires. In this case, called early halt(cid:173)
ing, a reply can be returned immediately and the RW stopped.
This reduces the communication overhead of lookups. As we
show by simulations, it usually halves the length of the RW.
UNIQUE-PATH access strategy. An optimization of the
PATH strategy is to perform the RW in a way that prevents the
RW from visiting nodes more than once, also known as self(cid:173)
avoiding RW [26]. This can be implemented, e.g., by storing
the list of all nodes visited by the RW in its message header.
In a rare event that all the neighbors of a current node have
been visited by that RW, a random neighbors is chosen (as
in simple RW). This optimization is expected to increase the
efficiency of the PATH strategy since more different nodes are
visited for the same number of steps at the cost of increased
communication bit-complexity. As can be seen from Figure 2,
empirically, indeed UNIQUE-PATH almost never revisits a
node (at least for quorums of size O(vn).
If the quorum system is to be used for a location service (or
any other service that requires quorum nodes to reply to the
originating node) the node that stores the location information
has to send back a reply, specifying the actual location.
If
either PATH or UNIQUE-PATH is being used, it would be
beneficial to send the reply back on the reverse path of the RW
(thus eliminating the need to invoke costly routing to send the
reply). In such case, one needs to store the ids of all nodes
visited by the RW in the message header anyway. Thus, if we
want to send a reply back on the reverse path, PATH has no
benefits over UNIQUE-PATH and the latter should be used.
FLOODING access strategy. Another way to access a quo(cid:173)
rum is by a limited scope flooding. That is, the request is
broadcasted from a given node to all its neighbors with a given
TTL. Each neighbor that receives the request for the first time
decreases the TIL by one, and if the result is larger than 0,
rebroadcasts the message to its neighbors, etc. All nodes that
receive the message are members of the quorum. FLOODING
can also be used to implement advertise quorums, by
flooding the whole network and every node picking to take
part in the advertise quorum with probability IQI/n.
The main challenge in using FLOODING is how to set
the TTL in order to ensure that the message is received by k
nodes, for a given k. Of course, TIL can be always overesti(cid:173)
mated, resulting in accessing more than the minimal required
number of nodes. However, this comes at the increased com(cid:173)
munication cost. Notice that for quorum intersection proper(cid:173)
ties, k is often a function of n (e.g., k == 2vn). Whenever the
density of the network is uniform and known, the TTL can be
approximated. However, due to the reliance on broadcast (and
especially in dynamic networks, in which nodes move and the
network density changes), it is hard to have a fine grain con(cid:173)
trol on the exact number of nodes that receive the message.
An additional disadvantage of FLOODING is that it does
not posses the early halting property - there is no way to
stop the flooding from expanding, before TTL expires. One
can use the expended ring strategy to overcome this problem,
however this also comes at an increased price. Another dis-

advantage for location services is the numerous number of
replies that will be sent back to the looking node, which also
increases the communication cost. Last but not least, broad(cid:173)
casting in wireless networks is less reliable and energy effi(cid:173)
cient than sending point-to-point messages.
5 Properties of Probabilistic Quorum Systems
As mentioned before, we can use any of the access
strategies mentioned in Section 4 to implement any of the
advertise and lookup quorums and we can mix and
match them. Below, we present a formal evaluation of quo(cid:173)
rum systems obtained by several of these combinations.
5.1
Intersection Probability and Cost
advertise RANDOM, lookup RANDOM. This is the
method of Malkhi et al. [27]. Lemma 3.4 from [27] states:
Lemma 5.1 Let Qa and Qb be quorums of size fVii each
chosen uniformly at random. Then the non-intersection prob(cid:173)
ability is Pr(Qa n Qb == 0)  1. Such r implies an average number
of neighbors, davg , which is 1rr2n == C In n.
With failures, one would like to know how many failures
leave the network connected. We look at a network with fixed
r and assume a failure model in which individual nodes crash
independently with fixed probability. In such a model, after i
nodes fail, the remaining network forms a Random Geomet(cid:173)
ric Graph, C2(n - i, r). This network remains connected if
n - i satisfies the necessary connectivity condition, namely,
l~/::~ii]. For example, in the network of 1000 nodes
r 2::
the minimal davg that guarantees connectivity is 7. Thus, if
the initial density is davg == 14, this network can withstand a
failure of up to half of the network.
Degradation Rate. We analyze the degradation rate as a
function of the percentage of crashed nodes, assuming nodes
crash independently. We calculate the probability of an inter(cid:173)
section of a lookup quorum with a previously established
advertise quorum. Denote by Qa(f) the live nodes of a
given advertise quorum after a fraction of f nodes have
failed. Qa(O) is the initial advertise quorum (before any
node crashes) that guarantees intersection with at least 1 - c
probability. IQa(f)1 == IQa(O)1 -
lookup quo(cid:173)
rums access only live nodes at the moment the access is being
issued so they are not affected by failures. Thus, the intersec(cid:173)
tion probability after a fraction f of nodes fails is:
