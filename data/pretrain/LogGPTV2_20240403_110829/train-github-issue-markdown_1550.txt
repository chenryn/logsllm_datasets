`vscode.window.showInputBox()` lets me accept user input through the command
palette, but it is a two step process. I have to first execute a command and
then i have to show the input box. Ideally, I should be able to prompt and
accept input in one command, much in the way the git branch prompt does:

here i'm prompted with "git checkout", if i have a set of branches they are
shown in the list, and I can free form type in any text in order to create a
new branch.
As an extension author I would love to be able to have a similar model. For
example, let's say I want to have a list of tasks and each task can take a
parameter.
myextension create thing1  
myextension create thing2
in this case i don't want to select "myextension create thing1" and then have
an input box. What i want is to be able to say "myextension thing1 thing1's
description". This is also similar to the extension install experience where i
can say `ext install myextension` where `myextension` is free form text.
