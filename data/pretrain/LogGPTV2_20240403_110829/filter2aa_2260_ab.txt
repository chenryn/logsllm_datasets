measure, the results of which are displayed using the Harvey Ball 
representations illustrated to the right.  Because each of the 
urban/metropolitan areas has already developed and exercised a 
Tactical Interoperable Communications Plan (TICP), it was determined 
that the minimum score would be a quarter of a Harvey Ball (“Early 
Implementation”) instead of an empty Harvey Ball.  Summary 
definitions of each score, included below, provide an understanding of what each 
urban/metropolitan area generally demonstrated in achieving a given maturity level.

Interoperable 
communications solutions 
are rarely used for multi-

Usage
Regional SOPs, reviewed 
through the TICP process, 
are in place and regularly 
used by included 
agencies. NIMS procedures 
are well established among 
all agencies and 
disciplines. All procedures 
were effectively utilized 
during exercise(s). 
Existing regional SOPs were 
reviewed and included in the 
TICP, and are in use by 
included agencies. NIMS-
compliant command and 
control has been instituted by 
all agencies and disciplines in 
the region. Despite minor 
issues, all SOPs were 
successfully demonstrated 
during exercise(s).
Some existing SOPs were 
incorporated in the TICP and 
steps have been taken to 
institute these interoperability 
procedures among included 
agencies. Formal NIMS/ICS 
procedures are in place, but 
understanding varies among 
agencies leading to some 
issues during the exercise(s).
Region-wide SOPs were 
developed and formalized for 
the first time through the 
TICP, but have not been 
disseminated to all included 
agencies. Some elements of 
NIMS/ICS procedures for 
command and control are in 
place, but understanding 
varies among agencies and 
was an area of difficulty 
during exercise(s).

Formal agreements outline the

sustainable funding 
for collective, 
regional interoperable

Some formal agreements

 Interoperable Communications        
Communication interoperability among agencies and jurisdictions is a long-standing problem in the 
public safety community.  Since DHS was established in 2002, it has been working expeditiously to 
improve interoperable communications.  From FY 2003 through FY 2006, more than $2.9 billion in 
grant assistance has been provided to state and local agencies for equipment and other projects to 
improve communications interoperability.  In addition, programs such as the Interoperable 
Communications Technical Assistance Program (ICTAP) and SAFECOM have developed tools 
and expedited technology standards 
development, testing, and evaluation to 
assist public safety agencies in the 
planning 
and 
implementation 
of 
communications systems.  However, as 
stated by DHS Secretary Michael 
Chertoff in his May 8, 2006, speech to 
the 
Tactical 
Interoperable 
Communications Planning Conference,5 
public 
safety 
still 
has

interoperability 
requirements that need to be identified 
and rapidly met.   
DHS understands that barriers to interoperable communications are both technical and 
operational. Each agency typically has its own unique legacy technologies, requirements,

Tactical Interoperable Communications Scorecards 
operating environments, laws, and processes.  Therefore, achieving interoperability requires that, 
in addition to addressing technology and disparate communications systems, agencies examine 
governance, procedures, training, exercises, and usage.  Beginning with the FY 2005 grant cycle, 
G&T began providing urban/metropolitan areas with operational planning and exercise support to 
address these needs within the framework of multijurisdictional, multidiscipline incident response.  
The scorecard is an important milestone in this ongoing process because it marks the culmination 
of 2 years of planning and exercising tactical interoperable communications capabilities.   
Beginning with the development of TICPs, DHS required designated urban/metropolitan areas to 
focus on the creation and/or validation of regional SOPs that, in some cases, represented the first 
time local jurisdictions had come together to align operational communications plans for incident 
response.  During the same time period, DHS emphasized multijurisdictional and multidiscipline 
governance structures as demonstrated through the development of the SAFECOM Statewide 
Communications Interoperability Planning Methodology and the Urban Area Working Group 
requirements.  Some areas had long-standing governance bodies that provided multijurisdictional 
and multidiscipline leadership in developing longer term communications goals and resource plans.  
Other areas used the TICP process as an opportunity to bring such leaders to the planning table.
