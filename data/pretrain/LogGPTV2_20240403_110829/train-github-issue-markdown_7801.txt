It would be nice if `@CanActivate` decorator would resolve some additional
bindings if provided. For instance if the check I want to do during this step
depends on some service that I've created, then I could do something like:
    @CanActivate((myService: MyService) => { /* here I could use `myService` that was injected */ }, {
        providers: [
            MyService
        ]
    })
I am aware that there is a `ComponentInstruction` passed to the function, but
that is not of much help if I want to use anything else beyond just that.
