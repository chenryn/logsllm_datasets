### HTTP Header Analysis and Origin Manifests

#### Header Sizes and Frequencies
- **Set-Cookie, Content-Security-Policy, and Public-Key-Pins** headers are notably large, often exceeding hundreds of bytes. This supports the claim in the origin policy draft that HTTP headers can occupy multiple KiB per request.
- **Server Header**: Occurs in 87.39% of observed HTTP responses with an average lifetime (stability) of 32.14 days. This high frequency and stability support the draft's assertion that HTTP headers are frequently repeated.

#### Automated Manifest Generation
- We used an automated manifest generator to create origin manifests for each day, using headers from recurring URLs.
- The `minsize` parameter was set to its default value of 2, ensuring that no origin manifests were generated based on fewer than two observed responses.
- The `cutoff` parameter, which determines the minimum size of the majority of responses that must agree on a header value before it is included in the fallback section, was evaluated at 50%, 70%, and 90%.

| Cutoff | Average Size | Average Stability | Stable vs. Total Manifests |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|----------------------------|
| 50%    | 408.13B      | 17.87d            | 883 / 1500                 |
| 70%    | 304.17B      | 18.40d            | 850 / 1494                 |
| 90%    | 282.89B      | 17.21d            | 819 / 1493                 |

- **Table 3** shows the average size and stability, as well as the number of fully stable (100 days) versus all generated non-empty manifests.
- To analyze the individual influence of headers on manifest stability, we examined the stability of headers in the fallback, baseline, and augmentonly sections of the generated manifests, using `minsize` 2 and `cutoff` 50%.

#### Observations
- **Cutoff Parameter Impact**: The `cutoff` parameter affects the size and stability of auto-generated origin manifests, indicating that these manifests should be reviewed by a security officer before deployment.
- **Stability**: The average stability of the generated origin manifests is around 18 days, suggesting that modifications are only needed occasionally, reducing the workload on security officers.
- **Size**: The average origin manifest is only a few hundred bytes, which is small compared to the content served by typical web origins, indicating manageable network traffic overhead.

### Performance Measurement

#### Goal
- The primary goal of the origin manifest mechanism is to improve security, but it also impacts network traffic. The mechanism increases traffic due to the transmission of the origin manifest file and the `Sec-Origin-Manifest` header, but decreases it by removing redundant headers and caching CORS preflight requests.

#### Setup
- We augmented the setup with extra proxies between the browser and client-proxy ("pre"), client-proxy and server-proxy ("mid"), and server-proxy and the Web ("post"). These proxies log traffic for analysis.
- We simulated web browsing sessions by querying Bing for the top 20 pages in each of the Alexa top 10,000 domains. A session includes all pages returned for a single top Alexa domain.
- Using Selenium, we automated a Chrome browser to visit each URL in the session, repeating the process four times: "before-uncached", "before-cached", "after-uncached", and "after-cached".

#### Results
- **URLs and Sessions**: Bing returned 180,831 URLs, of which 180,443 were unique, resulting in an average of 18.04 URLs per Alexa domain and session.
- **Usable Domains**: Out of 10,000 top Alexa domains, 8,983 were usable. The remaining 1,017 did not yield reliable results.
- **Traffic Volumes**:
  - **First Visit (Uncached)**: 34.3MiB total, 2.1MiB HTTP headers, 2.5KiB CORS preflight.
  - **After Origin Manifest (Uncached)**: 1.8MiB HTTP headers, 128.5KiB origin manifests, 470.1B CORS preflight, 34.0MiB total.
  - **First Visit (Cached)**: 27.6MiB total, 1.9MiB HTTP headers, 2.2KiB CORS preflight.
  - **After Origin Manifest (Cached)**: 1.6MiB HTTP headers, 78.5KiB origin manifests, 421.0B CORS preflight, 27.3MiB total.

- **Table 5** summarizes the average volume of web traffic for the 8,983 web browsing sessions, showing reductions in header-only and CORS preflight traffic, but a slight increase in total traffic due to the origin manifest mechanism.

### Discussion

- Our evaluation confirms that the origin manifest mechanism reduces network traffic, though the reduction is modest in practice.
- Auto-generated manifests provide a good starting point for security officers, but human inspection is recommended.
- The average stability of around 18 days makes the origin manifest mechanism practical for deployment.
- The prototype implementation indicates that adoption by browsers is feasible without breaking websites unexpectedly.

This comprehensive evaluation provides insights into the practicality and effectiveness of the origin manifest mechanism, supporting the ongoing standardization efforts.
