Fig. 8. CRC and DRC (ǫ = 0.3, δ = 0.2, m = 5) vs. Original Reading and Differential Privacy (5-DP)
leaking appliance with high information leakage whereas
electric shower is the hardest to identify with the low-
est information leakage. Similarly, in the semi-detached
house, at 5:45pm, kitchen bulb is the easiest to detect
(besides the refrigerator) whereas two computers are
the hardest to detect. In the terraced house, at 7:45am,
microwave is the easiest to detect (besides refrigerator)
whereas tumble dryer is the hardest to detect. Notice that
the ON status of some appliances can be leaked as a
combination (e.g., kitchen bulb and living room bulb in
the semi-detached house), and some appliances can be
detected from the correlations of energy usage in multiple
readings (e.g., dishwasher in the detached house).
Note that all the above observations match the ground truth
of power consumption in households. The information leakage
of each appliance’s ON status can either increase or decrease
over time due to the highly ﬂuctuated consumption amount
and the usage patterns of such appliance at different times.
Finally,
in order to learn how reading frequency affect
the privacy risks applied to different readings, we conducted
experiments to examine the number of privacy-leaking ap-
pliances at 6 selected times in the same day (3 AM, 7AM,
11AM, 3PM, 7PM, 11PM) by varying the reading frequencies
(from 1 reading per minute to 1 reading per 15 minutes).
Then, we plot the number of privacy-leaking appliances at
those 6 different times with 4 different reading frequencies in
Figure 7 (the results obtained from each house is plotted in a
subﬁgure). Therefore, we can learn that readings would leak
more private information if they are reported more frequently
(e.g., adversaries can identify the largest number of privacy-
leaking appliances if the readings are reported with the highest
frequency 1 minute/reading). This matches the fact that ﬁner-
grained readings would result in more privacy leakage.
3) CRC and DRC
To bound the privacy leakage in a reading stream, our
privacy preserving algorithm has two streaming options CRC
and DRC that satisfy (ǫ, δm)-Uncertainty. Due to space limit,
we only demonstrate the reading conversion results in the
sample detached house on Jan 1, 2008 in Figure 8. We can
ﬁnd out the safe readings w.r.t. to privacy parameters ǫ = 0.3,
δ = 0.2 and m = 5 are close to the original readings, then
the reading errors can be minimized in two different ways
(note that the aggregation and billing errors are negligible).
Meanwhile, we have plotted the reading conversion results for
differential privacy [11] by adding the generic Laplace noise
to ensure 5-DP for the reading stream in which the multi-
plicative differences between the probabilities of generating
any identical output from two neighboring inputs are bounded
by e5. The results show that differentially private algorithm
would lead to much higher errors and also greatly ﬂuctuate
the output readings.
4) Phantom Load
We also examined how phantom load (power consumption
as some appliances are OFF, e.g., computers, microwave,
electric oven and TV) affect the performance of information
leakage and the privacy preserving algorithm in our case
study. The phantom loads for such appliances are referred
to sites such as http://standby.lbl.gov/summary-table.html. For
instance, computer’s phantom load is ∼ 3.84% its regular
consumption rate, TV is ∼ 3.53%, Microwave is ∼ 0.21%,
and Washing Machine is ∼ 0.48%. In the case study, for the
appliances with phantom load, we assign the phantom load
to their OFF status and derive the number of privacy-leaking
appliances (PL App #) and the reading errors of the CRC and
DRC. Table V shows that phantom loads can slightly make the
readings safer and lead to less errors in reading conversions.

Finally, if some speciﬁc smart meters are deployed by con-
sumers with high-resolution readings (e.g., microgrids [19]),
e.g., the households established by UMass [5], information
leakage may still exist if explicitly disclosing such readings
to other parties. For instance, as the deployed smart meter
is integrated into the main grid, the high-resolution readings
might be analyzed in some applications (e.g., NILM [15], and
regional statistics [7]). Given any reading in such applications
(aggregated or ﬁne-grained), adversaries can still learn the
status of appliances with their background knowledge.
VII. LIMITATIONS AND CHALLENGES
Limitations. First, the reading errors of our CRC or DRC
based streaming algorithm can be relatively high if specifying
a small ǫ, δ and/or large m (for high privacy demand),
compared to the aggregation and billing errors (which can be
close to 0). Therefore, it may affect the accuracy of some
real-time services based on the smart meter streams (e.g.,
load monitoring). Second, as discussed in Section VI-E2, if
some appliances are very likely to be ON at most of the times
(I[t → ax] lies close to 1) such as refrigerator and heating
in winter, the information leakage of such appliances cannot
be effectively bounded without sacriﬁcing too much utility.
Nevertheless, its ON status leaks very limited privacy of the
consumers since almost all the households keep them running
all the time. Finally, once a new appliance is connected to the
home, smart meter needs to be re-initialized for the privacy
model. Also, the reading conversion may also violate some
regulations for guaranteeing the integrity of the bills in some
countries/regions.
Challenges. First, smart meter initialization requires an ex-
ponential complexity (ofﬂine) to generate the candidate rate
set and each possible consumption rate’s candidate appli-
ance set. For a small or medium number of appliances, the
algorithm can be executed once to obtain the exact result.
However, for a large number of appliances, we have to run
a heuristic algorithm (e.g., specifying a terminating point for
the algorithm) to obtain an approximated result. Second, the
information leakage of an appliance is derived based on both
the consumption rate and time. It is challenging to quantify
the information leakage from the temporal usage patterns of
different appliances I[t → ax]. In the case study on Jan 1,
2008 (Section VI-E), we survey energy consumers to obtain
such patterns (the likelihood that most energy consumers use
each appliance at different times). Alternatively, we can use
the probability distribution function in [10] to estimate such
patterns and the corresponding information leakage.
VIII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
Smart meter reading streams have posed severe privacy
threats to electricity consumers on the power grid. Beyond
the smart meter privacy issues tackled in literature, in this
paper, we have quantitatively measured and mitigated the
information leakage in such streaming data based on a wide
variety of background knowledge, including appliances’ con-
sumption rates and temporal patterns of usage, other correla-
tions/patterns of running the same or different appliances at
different times. We have deﬁned a novel privacy model for
time series reading stream and developed a privacy preserving
streaming algorithm that efﬁciently outputs safe readings with
excellent utility. We have conducted experiments on real
datasets to validate the performance of our approach.
We can extend our work in several directions. First, for
an exponential number of candidate consumption rates and
the corresponding appliance subsets in A’s power set, we can
try to develop other heuristic or approximation algorithms to
generate the safe candidate rate set instead of simply setting
the termination threshold for recursively traversing A’s power
set, e.g., designing rules to prune the search space. Second,
for some real-time applications (e.g., load monitoring [15])
which have high demand on reducing the reading errors, we
can explore other privacy preserving streaming algorithms for
smart meters to further minimize such errors. Third, inspired
from many state-of-the-art NILM solutions which start
to
use the transient of the power consumption signal or the
transition between power consumption states (e.g., HMM [24],
[22]) to estimate the speciﬁc-appliance’s consumption, we
plan to investigate the background knowledge of consumption
transient and the corresponding privacy leakage, and deﬁne
a rigorous privacy notion to quantify and bound such risks.
Moreover, information leakage may also occur in other time
series data, such as stock market data, and system/server logs.
We plan to explore efﬁcient privacy preserving solutions to
tackle all of these problems in our future work.

APPENDIX A
PRIVACY PRESERVING STREAMING FOR DYNAMIC
ENERGY BILLING
Besides the constant
~Rin (but without disclosing
tariff in a standard energy billing
plan, two different dynamic pricing policies (TOU and TB)
are widely adopted by utility companies [2], [27], [20]. To
minimize the billing errors under such plans, the smart meter
(e.g., household) can locally compute the bill using the input
readings
this time,
billing can be separated from the CRC or DRC based privacy
preserving streaming. Then, output reading stream ~Rout can
be transmitted to the utility company in sequence while the
smart meter can still privately use ~Rin and TOU or TB plan
to calculate the bill (disclosing the bill would not leak any
information in the vector ~Rin [17]). In this case, we assume
that the smart meter (e.g., a household) is a trusted entity to
report the true bill (dynamic pricing) to the utility company.
