fect can transform mechanical energy to electrical energy, it has
been used to harvest energy from different kinds of underwater
movements, including those resulting from swimmer body move-
ments [20], fish movements [14, 40], water currents [70, 78], mo-
tor vibrations [39], and even ambient noise [65]. Moreover, due
to their high electromechanical conversion efficiency, piezoelectric
resonators have been used in designing a wide array of underwater
transducers [12]. PAB’s design builds on this past work for energy
harvesting and electromechanical translation. Our contributions are
orthogonal and focus on exploiting the piezoelectric effect to enable
underwater backscatter communication and developing protocols for
underwater backscatter networking.
It is worth noting that the term backscatter is widely used in the
context of underwater sensing [22, 29, 60]. The usage of the term
refers to SONAR-based imaging, similar to how radar imaging is of-
ten called backscatter [18, 32]. This is different from the networking
community’s use of the backscatter term to refer to communication
by modulating reflections [43, 48, 82], which is the focus of this
work.
Finally, our work advances the recently growing interest in bat-
teryless underwater communication [24, 40]. In contrast to PAB,
all existing systems communicate by generating their own acoustic
carriers, which requires multiple orders of magnitude more energy
than backscatter communication [85]. As a result, existing systems
need to harvest power for long periods of time (e.g., from fish move-
ments [40]) before they have enough energy to generate an acoustic
beacon. As a result, their average throughput is limited to few to tens
of bits per second [31, 40]. PAB shares the same motivation of this
line of work and pushes its boundaries by introducing underwater
backscatter, which significantly decreases the energy required for
transmissions and boosts the network throughput by two to three
orders of magnitude.
3 PIEZO-ACOUSTIC BACKSCATTER
In this section, we first describe the basic physical principles that
enable backscattering acoustic signals in underwater environments,
then describe how PAB uses these principles to design an underwater
backscatter networking system.
3.1 Piezoelectric Transducers
Before we explain piezo-acoustic backscatter, we describe how the
piezoelectric effect is typically employed for underwater acoustic
communication. A piezoelectric transducer can transform acous-
tic signals into electrical signals at the same frequency, and vice
versa [12]. In order to transmit acoustic signals, we can apply a
voltage on a piezoelectric device, causing it to vibrate at the same
frequency of the applied voltage. The vibration creates a pressure
wave which travels as an acoustic or ultrasonic signal depending on
the vibration frequency.
For simplicity, assume that we would like to transmit a sine wave
at a single frequency f . If we apply a signal with some peak voltage
V to the piezoelectric device, that results in the following transmitted
pressure wave:
P = αV sin(2π f t + ϕ)
where t is time, ϕ is the phase offset, α is a proportionality constant
which depends on various factors including the type of piezoelectric
material, transducer geometry, and frequency of operation [12]. Nat-
urally, while the above discussion focuses on a single sine wave, it
can be extended to any modulation scheme (BPSK, QAM, OFDM,
etc.) by multiplying the sine wave by the desired baseband signal as
in typical wireless communication [80].
3.2 Backscattering Acoustic Signals
In standard underwater acoustic communication, a transmitter gener-
ates and amplifies the carrier signal (i.e., the sine wave), a process
that consumes most of the transmitter’s energy. Even low-power
acoustic transmitters typically require few hundred Watts [67, 83].
Below, we show how a PAB sensor can employ backscatter to com-
municate without generating any carrier wave, which enables it to
communicate at near-zero power.
Recall that backscatter communication involves switching be-
tween reflective and non-reflective states. In the non-reflective (ab-
sorptive) state, a PAB sensor can simply operate in a manner similar
to a standard piezoelectric receiver (hydrophone), transforming a
pressure wave into an electric signal. However, the reflective state is
not straightforward and hence is the focus of our discussion.
To demonstrate that it is possible to transform a piezoelectric ma-
terial into a reflector, we resort to the fundamental physical process
that governs the converse piezoelectric effect. Piezoelectric materials
respond to both electrical and mechanical stimuli. Said differently,
an electric field (E) or a tensor/stress (T) applied on the material
causes charge accumulation (D) at its terminals. We can express the

relationship using the following equation [12]:

+ ϵT E(cid:124)(cid:123)(cid:122)(cid:125)
=
where d is the piezoelectric coefficient, and ϵT the permittivity
coefficient under constant stress. The above equation shows the
coupled nature of piezoelectric materials.
In order to backscatter an incoming acoustic signal, PAB turns on
a switch that connects the two terminals of the piezoelectric device
as shown in Fig. 1(b). Doing so ensures that the charge distribution
D and the electric field E are both set to zero in the steady state
(since there is no voltage or charge when the terminals are shorted).
Substituting these values into Eq. 1 demonstrates that the net tensor
T experienced by the piezoelectric material must be zero.
But how can the tensor (stress) be zero in the presence of an
incoming acoustic signal (from the projector) which induces pressure
on the piezoelectric material? To answer this question, observe that
the above relationship depends on the net tensor experienced by
the piezoelectric material. We can express the net tensor as the sum
of the incoming pressure wave from the projector (Pin) and the
reflected pressure wave Pr ef . Hence, when the two terminals of
a piezoelectric device are connected, any incoming signal will be
entirely reflected as per the following equation:
Pr ef = T − Pin = −P0 sin(2π f t)
where P0 is the amplitude of the incident pressure wave caused by the
acoustic signal. This derivation demonstrates the power of backscat-
ter, whereby the backscattering node does not need to generate its
own carrier but rather relies on an external one for communication.
We note that our above discussion is simplified in two ways. First,
the derivation assumes that the piezoelectric device itself is lossless.
In practice, some of the incoming signal is dissipated due to heat
and, as a result, the amplitude of the reflected wave is smaller than
that of the incident wave. Second, while the net tensor is directly
related to the applied pressure, this relationship may also involve a
multiplicative factor which depends on the geometry and polarization
of the piezoelectric material [12] as well as the angle of the incoming
pressure wave with respect to the surface of the resonator.
Physical Interpretation. So far, by looking at the relationship gov-
erning the charge displacement D, we have demonstrated that a
piezoelectric material can be used as a reflector. Next, we are inter-
ested in gaining insight into the mechanical interpretation of this
process. Recall that a piezoelectric material deforms when a ten-
sor (stress) or an electric field is applied to its terminals. The total
deformation (strain) is given by the following equation:
S = sET + dE
where sE is the compliance coefficient under constant electric field.
As per our above discussion, when the piezoelectric material is in
reflective state, both the electric field and the net tensor are zero. This
means that the total strain is also nulled. The mechanical interpre-
tation demonstrates that PAB transforms the piezoelectric material
into a reflector by preventing it from deforming. This ensures that an
incoming pressure wave must be entirely reflected, further demon-
strating the reflective phenomenon from a mechanical perspective.
Figure 2—Received and Demodulated Backscatter Signal. The figure plots the re-
ceived signal after demodulation and low-pass filtering. After PAB starts backscattering,
the larger amplitude corresponds to the reflected state while the smaller amplitude
corresponds to the non-reflected state. The node switches between these two states to
communicate bits of 0s and 1s (using FM0 encoding).
Testing the Waters. We run an experiment with a PAB sensor un-
derwater. We use an underwater projector to send an acoustic signal
at 15 kHz and configure the PAB sensor to backscatter the signals by
switching its impedance between reflective and non-reflective every
100ms. The design of the sensor is detailed in §4. We receive the
signal using a hydrophone and demodulate by removing the carrier
frequency.
Fig. 2 plots the amplitude of the received output over time. The
plot exhibits a jump to a constant amplitude at t = 2.2s, which corre-
sponds to the start of the downlink transmission from the projector.
Note that even though the projector transmits at 15 kHz, we only see
a constant amplitude since downconversion removes the carrier wave
and only keeps its amplitude. At t = 2.8 s, the amplitude of the re-
ceived signal starts alternating between two states. This corresponds
to the time when the PAB node starts backscattering and the two
amplitudes correspond to the two reflective states. The change in am-
plitude between the node’s two states is weaker than the amplitude
of the constant wave transmitted by the projector. This is due to two
reasons: first, the signal from the backscatter node travels a longer
distance than the one coming directly from the projector (since it
travels from the projector to the node and back to the hydrophone)
and hence experiences larger attenuation. Second, the backscatter
process is lossy, meaning that the reflected signal will be weaker
than the incident one. These observations are in line with those of
radio backscatter [82], and the experiment validates PAB’s ability to
communicate via piezo-acoustic backscatter.
Now that we have demonstrated underwater backscatter, our de-
sign adapts few additional components from RF backscatter de-
signs [23, 85]:
• Modulation: Our above discussion focused on demonstrating the
ability to switch between two reflective states to enable backscat-
ter, and abstracted the two states as bits of ‘0’ and ‘1’. In practice,
backscatter communication can be made more robust by adopt-
ing modulation schemes like FM0 or Manchester encoding [82],
where the reflection state switches at every bit, enabling the re-
ceiver to better delineate the bits and robustly decode backscatter
signals. Hence, PAB adopts FM0 modulation on the uplink.
• Energy Harvesting & Battery-Free Operation: The absorptive
state of backscatter modulation provides an opportunity to har-
vest energy from the projector’s downlink communication signal
since it involves a conversion between mechanical and electrical
energy. Similar to passive RFIDs, PAB harnesses this opportunity.
It employs a rectifier and capacitor to store this energy, and uses

it for controlling the backscatter switch. This energy may also be
used for powering various onboard sensors. Moreover, to ensure
maximum power transfer and optimize energy harvesting in the
absorptive state, our front-end employs an impedance matching
network (to match the load impedance ZL to the conjugate of the
piezoelectric source Zs ). We also adopt the Pulse Width Modula-
tion (PWM) scheme on the downlink since it can be decoded using
simple envelope detection, thus minimizing power consumption
during backscatter and since it provides ample opportunities for
energy harvesting [23].
• Maximizing the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR): In order to max-
imize the (SNR) and hence the throughput, we would like to
maximize the difference between the reflected power in the two
reflective states of backscatter communication. To do so, we rely
on the standard backscatter reflection equation [37, 53]:
(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ZL − Z∗
s
ZL + Zs
(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)2
Pr =
Pi
(2)
where Pr and Pi are reflected and incident power respectively,
and * denotes the complex conjugate. Recall that in the reflective
state, the two terminals are shorted (i.e., ZL = 0), and hence the
entire incident wave is reflected. Thus, to maximize the SNR, we
need to minimize the reflected power in the absorptive state. This
can be achieved by setting ZL = Z∗
s . Notice that this is the same
impedance that maximizes the energy transfer as discussed above.
3.3 From Communication to Networking
A fundamental challenge facing PAB networks is that piezoelectric
materials are designed to resonate at specific frequencies [12].3 On
one hand, operating at resonance maximizes the energy transfer
between mechanical and electrical states, which improves both the
sensitivity and the energy harvesting efficiency. On the other hand,
it limits the operation bandwidth of piezoelectric energy harvesters.
The limited bandwidth prevents adopting MAC protocols like FDMA
where different backscatter nodes may transmit concurrently, each
occupying its own frequency channel.
In this section, we describe how PAB overcomes this challenge
through a hardware-based resonance tuning design and a receiver
