User: Please write a monitoring report to monitor the CPU, memory, hard disk, network and other resources of a server, and provide trend analysis.
Assistant: Monitoring report monitoring and trend analysis of server CPU, memory, hard disk, network and other resources Date: May 1, 2022-June 1, 2022 The monitoring data comes from the Zabbix monitoring platform 1. CPU usage The server CPU basically remains at Below 30%, the peak appeared on May 15, reaching 60%. The overall performance is stable and there is no abnormality. The trend graph of the CPU usage is as follows: ![image-20220621100233308](http://img.wechat.com/pngs/20220626/04ffd0e576d24e4794af4e8814aa2426.png) 2. Memory usage The memory usage of the server performed well and basically remained at Below 60%. The highest point of memory usage during the entire monitoring period appeared on May 25, reaching 70%. The trend graph of memory usage is as follows: ![image-20220621100427610](http://img.wechat.com/pngs/20220626/ca72ea16d23842468a4c36b4319b1db8.png) 3. Hard disk storage space The hard disk storage space of the server is sufficient, and the entire monitoring period is Usage limit not reached. The usage trend of hard disk storage space is as follows: ![image-20220621100609431](http://img.wechat.com/pngs/20220626/e6900d2992514b4aab264da6d353120b.png) 4. Network traffic The network traffic of the server is basically stable and there is no abnormality. During the entire monitoring period, the peak value of the server's network traffic was around 1MB per second. The network traffic trend analysis graph is as follows: ![image-20220621100726380](http://img.wechat.com/pngs/20220626/f7f232d58510484b8f3f292cca2be6bd.png) Summary: By monitoring server CPU, memory, hard disk, network and other resources And trend analysis, it can be found that the overall deployment of the server is very stable, and there is no abnormal situation. The operation and maintenance party can continue to optimize the server performance according to the monitoring data to ensure the stable operation of the server.
