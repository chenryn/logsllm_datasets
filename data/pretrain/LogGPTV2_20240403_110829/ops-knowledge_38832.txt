User: I have been working on Python quite a lot recently and started reading the doc for Django, however I can't deny the fact that most of the video tutorials I find usually shows Linux as the chosen OS. I've ignored this mostly, but I started to come upon some problems with people using commands such as "touch" for which I have no idea about what the equivalent is in the Windows 7 command prompt. I've heard about New-Item in Power Shell, however it's messy and I am fearing that this "equivalent hunt" might come again and again...
So I started to wonder why were most of the people using Linux with Python, would be a good move (knowing that my Linux knowledge is completely null) to learn to use Linux for development purpose? Would it allow me to be more efficient at developing with Python in general? Would it be possible to list the benefits of doing so?
Assistant: I normally use OSX on my desktop, but I use Linux for Python because that's how it will get deployed.  Specifically, I use Ubuntu Desktop in a virtual machine to develop Python applications and I use Ubuntu on the server to deploy them.  This means that my understanding of library and module requirements/dependencies are 100% transferrable to the server when I'm ready to deploy the application.  
If I used OSX (or Windows) to develop Python apps I would have to deal with two different methods of handling requirements and dependencies --- it's just too much work.
My suggestion:  use VMWare Player (it's free) and find a Ubuntu VM to start learning.  It's not too complicated and is actually quite fun.
