our device-specific dataset, we find that some 10% of disruptions
are the result of such migrations. Since anti-disruption behavior
is highly unevenly distributed across different ASes in different
regions of the world, this phenomenon can easily lead to severe
over-estimations of Internet outages when attempting to study reli-
ability in individual regions, or networks. Moreover, we find that
state-of-the-art active outage detection overestimates disruption
occurrences, resulting from a few unstable blocks. After filtering,
we confirm the majority of Trinocular-detected disruptions, boding
well for further research and refinement of active outage detection.
Further, we find that outages at the edge are hardly visible in the
global routing table, with only some 20%-25% of disruptions that are
very likely outages resulting in a loss of BGP visibility. Contrarily,
we find that even a BGP withdrawal is not a definitive indication of
a service outage, either. Some 15% of disruptions that do not result
in service outages show up with BGP withdrawals. Our findings
caution against taking such measurement results at face value.
Future directions: With the proliferation of Smartphone use, as
well as smart home devices, baseline activity is likely to increase
in the future, further expanding the coverage for passive outage
detection. Other vantage points (e.g., traffic at border routers of
ISPs or universities) could potentially capture such activity at a
finer granularity in space and time, albeit with a smaller coverage.
More fine-grained measurements could allow for better matching
of disruptions and anti-disruptions, potentially allowing to isolate
and remove such cases from outage detection analyses. It remains
an open question whether it is feasible to detect such instances
with active techniques, since it would require probing vast ranges
of often inactive parts of the address space.
It is currently unclear how increasing deployment of Carrier-
Grade NAT gateways as result of IPv4 exhaustion [47, 49] might
affect address-based outage detection systems, including ours. In
the IPv6 Internet, passive approaches to track edge reliability will
become more important, where active probing is problematic due to
the vastness of the space and the ephemeral nature of addresses [44].
We plan to evaluate the feasibility of our approach for IPv6 traffic. A
key challenge here will be to identify address aggregates, prefixes,
that yield a baseline activity, where the size of these prefixes will
necessarily vary greatly across the client address space, see [45]. An
essential feature we leverage for disruption detection is constant
baseline activity before and after a disruption event, which does
not allow for online analysis. While we can certainly estimate the
start of a potential disruption, online analysis can not immediately
distinguish between temporary events (disruptions) vs. long-term
changes, and level shifts. We plan to investigate such events, their
prevalence, and impact on online analysis. To detect disruptions in
prefixes where activity regularly goes to near zero, say on weekends,
the notion of baseline could be generalized to a not necessarily
contiguous set of measurement bins.
9.2 Implications for Outage Interpretation
We have learned that disruptions in address activity can have a
variety of causes, and that planned human intervention is a major
factor. We are able to identify likely causes for many of the detected
disruptions, including service outages. For example, consider ISP A
in our case study (§ 8): some 67% of /24s were only disrupted dur-
ing scheduled maintenance intervals, another 11% only during a
one-week interval of Hurricane Irma. That leaves only some 20%
of disrupted blocks that fall outside these two categories. A key
implication here is that the interpretation of reliability and outage
measurements must take such factors into account and be qualified
by specific questions under study. Does a service outage during
scheduled maintenance have the same significance as one due to
an unplanned network fault? Should Service Level Agreements
(SLAs) make a distinction? SLAs for enterprise Internet connec-
tivity (e.g., [1, 2]), for example, exclude service outages within
scheduled maintenance intervals from network availability calcula-
tions (albeit sometimes with a clause that subscribers be notified of
such events), as well as service outages caused by events of force
majeure (e.g., natural disasters). Thus, statistics on disruptions and
outages need to be put into proper perspective.
Future directions: Accurate measurement and interpretation of
Internet outages will become more critical in the future, when ISPs
will most likely become subject to more stringent regulations e.g.,
by the FCC in the US, in particular outage reporting requirements.
Current reporting requirements [3] cover telephone service and
set reporting criteria based on minimum duration of outages (30
minutes) and affected user minutes (900,000 user minutes). A key
challenge will be how to define criteria for Internet outages, their
duration, magnitude, and eventual impact on end users to derive
robust threshold criteria for Internet outage reporting requirements.
