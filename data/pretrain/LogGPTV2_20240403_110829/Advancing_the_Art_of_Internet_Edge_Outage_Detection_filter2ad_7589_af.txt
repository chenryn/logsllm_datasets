### Analysis of Internet Disruptions and Outages

In our device-specific dataset, we find that approximately 10% of disruptions are caused by such migrations. Given that anti-disruption behavior is highly unevenly distributed across different Autonomous Systems (ASes) in various regions, this phenomenon can lead to significant over-estimations of Internet outages when studying the reliability of individual regions or networks. Additionally, state-of-the-art active outage detection methods tend to overestimate disruption occurrences, often due to a few unstable blocks. After filtering, we confirm the majority of Trinocular-detected disruptions, which bodes well for further research and refinement of active outage detection techniques.

Furthermore, we observe that outages at the edge of the network are not easily visible in the global routing table. Only about 20%-25% of disruptions, which are very likely to be outages, result in a loss of BGP visibility. Conversely, even a BGP withdrawal is not a definitive indication of a service outage. Approximately 15% of disruptions that do not result in service outages are associated with BGP withdrawals. These findings caution against taking such measurement results at face value.

### Future Directions

With the increasing use of smartphones and smart home devices, baseline activity is expected to rise, potentially expanding the coverage for passive outage detection. Other vantage points, such as traffic at border routers of ISPs or universities, could capture such activity with finer spatial and temporal granularity, albeit with smaller coverage. More fine-grained measurements could allow for better matching of disruptions and anti-disruptions, potentially enabling the isolation and removal of such cases from outage detection analyses. It remains an open question whether it is feasible to detect such instances with active techniques, as it would require probing vast ranges of often inactive parts of the address space.

The impact of the increasing deployment of Carrier-Grade NAT gateways, driven by IPv4 exhaustion, on address-based outage detection systems, including ours, is currently unclear. In the IPv6 Internet, passive approaches to track edge reliability will become more important, as active probing is problematic due to the vastness of the address space and the ephemeral nature of addresses. We plan to evaluate the feasibility of our approach for IPv6 traffic. A key challenge here will be to identify address aggregates and prefixes that yield a baseline activity, where the size of these prefixes will vary greatly across the client address space. An essential feature we leverage for disruption detection is constant baseline activity before and after a disruption event, which does not allow for online analysis. While we can estimate the start of a potential disruption, online analysis cannot immediately distinguish between temporary events (disruptions) and long-term changes or level shifts. We plan to investigate such events, their prevalence, and their impact on online analysis. To detect disruptions in prefixes where activity regularly goes to near zero, say on weekends, the notion of baseline could be generalized to a non-contiguous set of measurement bins.

### Implications for Outage Interpretation

We have learned that disruptions in address activity can have a variety of causes, with planned human intervention being a major factor. We are able to identify likely causes for many of the detected disruptions, including service outages. For example, in our case study of ISP A, approximately 67% of /24 subnets were only disrupted during scheduled maintenance intervals, and another 11% only during a one-week interval of Hurricane Irma. This leaves only about 20% of disrupted blocks that fall outside these two categories. A key implication here is that the interpretation of reliability and outage measurements must take such factors into account and be qualified by specific questions under study. Does a service outage during scheduled maintenance have the same significance as one due to an unplanned network fault? Should Service Level Agreements (SLAs) make a distinction? SLAs for enterprise Internet connectivity, for instance, exclude service outages within scheduled maintenance intervals from network availability calculations, provided subscribers are notified of such events, as well as service outages caused by force majeure events (e.g., natural disasters). Thus, statistics on disruptions and outages need to be put into proper perspective.

### Future Directions

Accurate measurement and interpretation of Internet outages will become more critical in the future, especially as ISPs are likely to face more stringent regulations, such as those imposed by the FCC in the U.S., particularly regarding outage reporting requirements. Current reporting requirements cover telephone service and set criteria based on the minimum duration of outages (30 minutes) and affected user minutes (900,000 user minutes). A key challenge will be to define criteria for Internet outages, their duration, magnitude, and eventual impact on end users to derive robust threshold criteria for Internet outage reporting requirements.
