I'm sorry if this is a stupid question but I'm stuck. I need to respond to a
click on a line-number inside the `atom-text-editor` and I can't figure out
how to do it. The dom shadow gets in my way for everything I try.
A simple `$('.line-number')` gets zero matches when the dom shadow is enabled.
I can match on the `atom-text-editor` element but nothing inside. I read the
package update doc and it just refers to `$(window)` which doesn't help.
This is a bit of a duplicate from .https://discuss.atom.io/t/events-from-
