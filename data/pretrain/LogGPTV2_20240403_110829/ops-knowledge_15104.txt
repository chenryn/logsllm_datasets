User: Multiple Docker containers are running on one server, how to manage and deploy them through Docker Compose?
Assistant: Through Docker Compose, multiple Docker containers can be managed and deployed at the same time. The specific steps are as follows: 1. Write the docker-compose.yml file, which contains the configuration information of each service that needs to be run, such as mirroring, environment variables, port mapping, etc. 2. In the directory where the docker-compose.yml file is located, run the docker-compose up command to start all the services configured in the file. 3. You can use the docker-compose ps command to view the status of all currently running services. 4. You can use the docker-compose logs command to view the logs of all services. 5. You can use the docker-compose stop command to stop all services. 6. You can use the docker-compose start command to start all services. 7. You can use the docker-compose restart command to restart all services. 8. You can use the docker-compose down command to stop and delete all services.
