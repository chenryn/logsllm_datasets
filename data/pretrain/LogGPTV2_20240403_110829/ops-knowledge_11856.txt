User: I have a list of directories which have many sub-directories. 
e.x. C:\home\test\myfiles\myfile.txt 
I want to copy this to my X: drive. How do I copy myfile.txt if the X: drive only contains X:\\home? 
I thought shutil would create necessary directories when copying files but I was wrong and I am not sure what to use.
Worded another way...
I want to copy C:\\home\\test\\myfiles\\myfile.txt to X:\\home\\test\\myfiles\\myfile.txt but X:\\home\\test\\myfiles does not exist.
Thanks!
Assistant: You need to use os.makedirs along side shutil.copytree.
