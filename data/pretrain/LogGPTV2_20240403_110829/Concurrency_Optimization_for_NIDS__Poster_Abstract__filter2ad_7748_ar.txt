investigated and elucidated To acquire knowledge about changes in biochemical pathways in the cancer tissue, we chose to apply untargeted 
metabolomics with the use of LC-MS The first stage of the study was focused on selecting the most appropriate sample preparation method Due 
to limited availability of GIST tissue samples, we aimed at developing a method that provides possibility of extracting both polar and lipophilic 
metabolites from one small GIST specimen Tissue samples were homogenized with a 50:50 mixture (v/v) of methanol and water in ratio 1:10 (w/v) 
and obtained homogenate was subjected to five different methods of extraction They included monophasic extraction with methyl tert-butyl 
ether (MTBE) and methanol, biphasic extraction with different ratios of MTBE, methanol and water as well as with dichloromethane, methanol and 
water, and two-step extraction with the same solvents Organic extracts were analyzed with reversed phase LC-TOF-MS, while HILIC separation 
was used for polar extracts Criteria for sample preparation method selection were based on the number of features detected in the extracts and 
reproducibility of extraction procedure The selected method will be further used in metabolomic fingerprinting of GIST tissue specimens, which can 
complement genomic studies on GIST or propose potential new therapeutic targets

Method development for determination of modified nucleosides and deoxynucleosides in urine and plasma samples
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Malgorzata Patejko, Medical University of Gdańsk, Poland
CO-AUTHORS: Wiktoria Struck-Lewicka, Danuta Siluk, Marcin Markuszewski,
Modified nucleosides and deoxynucleosides are products of RNA and DNA turnover They are not metabolized and cannot be utilized for 
synthesis of RNA and DNA molecules They are excreted in unchanged form Consequently, a correlation between their elevated level in urine 
and pathophysiological disorders development can be expected Increased level of modified nucleosides and deoxynucleosides was observed 
in such diseases as: hepatocellular carcinoma, breast cancer or urogenital cancer The aim of the study is the targeted metabolomics analysis 
of 11 modified nucleosides and deoxynucleosides in urine and plasma samples collected from bladder cancer patients with the use of LC-QqQ/
MS technique Since proper sample treatment influences obtained results significantly, the first task of the research covered the development 
of sample preparation procedure This included optimization of separation conditions and solid-phase extraction procedure (SPE) Different 
chromatographic conditions were compared, including: type of stationary phase, flow rate, column temperature and gradient programme 
According to SPE, differences in the sugar moiety between nucleosides and deoxynucleosides cause differences in their extraction ability and 
consequently difficulties with sorbent selection that allows for the extraction of nucleosides and deoxynucleosides at once Previously, nucleosides 
and deoxynucleosides were more often analyzed separately The goal was to develop method for simultaneous extraction of nucleosides and 
deoxynucleosides from urine and plasma Different sorbents were evaluated by their selectivity, recovery and ability to extract modified nucleosides 
and deoxynucleosides Method based on selected sorbent was further optimized Acknowledgement: The work has been supported by the National 
Centre of Science, project no 2018/29/N/NZ7/02299

Application of targeted metabolic analysis to study glycolysis-related metabolic changes in oral cancer cells
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Chul-Ho Jeong, College of Pharmacy, Keimyung University, South Korea
CO-AUTHORS: Won-Jun Jang, Ji Hae Seo
The application of metabolomics to cancer research field could help to explain the causes of phenotypic changes during acquisition of drug 
resistance and metabolic alteration in cancer cells In this reason, understanding metabolic change induced by altered glycolytic pathway in cancer 
cells is crucial for overcoming drug resistance in various cancers In the present study, the mass spectrometry-based targeted metabolic profiling 
was performed to compare the metabolic changes in oral cancer cells, SCC15 following treatment with 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG), 2-DG+pyruvate, 
and 2DG+mannose Then we quantified and compared statistically five metabolite groups, acylcarnitines, amino acids and biogenic amines, 
glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids and monosaccharides Our targeted metabolomic analyses revealed that significant changes were evident 
in metabolic pathways involved in the regulation of amino acids (15), polyamine (1), and fatty acids (3) Significant decreases in the levels of amino 
acids, polyamine and significant increases in the levels of the lysophosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin were observed in 
2DG-treated SCC15 cells Furthermore, we found that treatment with pyruvate or mannose significantly restored metabolic changes in 2DG-treated 
SCC15 cells Collectively, this study reveals that there are increased metabolic demands reflecting the changes in glycolysis-related amino acids 
metabolism, which might advance our understanding of metabolic alteration in cancer

Metabolic correlations to weight change in patients with head- and neck cancer: A pilot study
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Kristian Pirttilä, Uppsala University, Sweden
CO-AUTHORS: Ylva Tiblom Ehrsson, Göran Laurell, Mikael Hedeland, Torbjörn Arvidsson, Curt Pettersson
Patients afflicted with head and neck cancer (HNC) often suffer from unintentional weight loss and cancer cachexia is prevalent This pilot study 
is a part of a multi-center study of HNC patients in Sweden The aim was to investigate the correlation of the plasma metabolome at different time 
points to the weight change of patients Plasma samples from 31 patients taken at three different time points (at diagnosis, 7 weeks after treatment 
started, and 12 weeks after treatment ended) were analyzed using a HILIC-UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS-protocol The treatment modality of patients varied, 
however 27 out of the 31 patients had received radio therapy The metabolome at the different time points as well as changes between time 
points were correlated using orthogonal projection to latent structures (OPLS) to a weight outcome factor calculated for each patient based on 
clinical measurements A correlation with weight outcome was found in the 7 week (R2 0807, Q2 0412, p = 007) and 12 week follow-up samples 
(R2 0679, Q2 0361, p 12 h fasting plasmas from 
sequential consenting subjects (n=1162) undergoing elective diagnostic cardiac evaluations with longitudinal follow-up and adjudicated incident 
(3 year) adverse event monitoring Among the identified metabolites, several sugar alcohols were significantly associated with incident CVD event 
risk To validate the semi-quantitative untargeted metabolomics findings, an independent and new stable-isotope dilution liquid chromatography 
tandem mass spectrometry method (LC-MS/MS) for the quantitation of sugar alcohols was developed and validated The method includes plasma 
protein precipitation and sugar alcohols derivatization with acetic anhydride, followed by liquid-liquid extraction and LC/MS/MS analysis Preliminary 
analysis on small and independent validation cohort of subjects (n=200) undergoing cardiac risk factor evaluation/modification in a preventive 
cardiology clinic replicated the observed CVD risks associated with select sugar alcohols A complete validation analysis of the targeted sugar 
alcohols as predictors of incident CVD risks (myocardial infarction, stroke or death) in a large and non-overlapping cohort of patients (n > 2000) also 
confirmed the potential clinical utility of sugar alcohols as predictors of incident CVD risks Mechanistic animal model studies to explore whether 
associations observed between select sugar alcohols confirmed and CVD phenotypes are causally linked are under way

Background: The ENSAT-HT project aims to establish a biomarker signature for different forms of adrenal hypertension (AHT) based on a multi-
omics approach, including untargeted plasma metabobolomics Our aim is to define the metabolic signature of AHT patients suffering from either 
Primary Aldosteronism (PA, n=106), Cushing’s Syndrome (CS, n=39) or Pheochromocytoma and Paraganglioma (PPGL, n=98), and compare it 
to primary hypertensives (PHT, n=109) and healthy volunteers (HV, n=133) Methods: Heparinized plasma samples were collected from all study 
subjects and analyzed in a randomized order, along with Quality Controls (QC), using proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy (1H-NMR) 
The resulting spectra were processed and converted to a readable table by multivariate statistical analysis (MVA) tools; Principal Component 
Analysis (PCA) was applied to check for outliers and trends within the dataset and Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) to build a 
sample classification model Results: Upon inspection of the PCA score plot of NMR plasma data, a tight clustering of the QC samples was observed, 
indicating the analytical robustness of the complete methodological approach A PLS-DA model was built for classification of samples in either PHT 
or AHT with an accuracy of >80% Conclusions: A reliable NMR metabolomics approach was applied on human plasma samples The initial analysis 
suggests that patient classification based on the presence of either adrenal or primary hypertension appears to be feasible Future plans include 
diminishing the effects of confounders and the application of Multilevel MVA methods to delineate the pathophysiological mechanisms of AHT

Dyslipidemia, lipoprotein overproduction or deficiency, is an important risk factor for coronary heart disease and stroke Metabolomics information 
about dyslipidemic patients is still limited Patients non-responder or intolerant to statins usually undergo lipoprotein apheresis (LA) to lower LDL 
levels LA exert pleiotropic effects altering a number of blood components [1,2] We performed a multi-parametric assessment of the inflammatory, 
PCSK-9 level, together with metabolic and proteomic profiles of dyslipidemic patients undergoing LA to gain information about LA effects 
and to deeper investigate the disease Serum samples from 9 patients undergoing three consecutive LA (B Braun) procedures were assayed 
Samples were collected before and after each procedure Nuclear magnetic resonance and ESI-Q-ToF LC/MS were used to assess metabolomics 
and proteomic patterns, respectively Lipid profile and PCSK-9 levels were biochemically measured Together with the expected depletion 
of lipoprotein-related proteins and PCSK-9 levels, we observed a reduction of complement- and inflammation-related proteins after each LA 
procedure We identified around 50 soluble metabolites defining the metabolic baseline profile of dyslipidemic patients (before LA treatment) LA 
influences patient’s proteomic pattern whereas has no impact on intermediate and final products of metabolic pathways For 3 out of the 9 patients, 
we identified the accumulation of branched-chain amino acids The integration of metabolomics with other omic-based approaches turns out to be 
relevant to identify clinical markers to support physicians in the choice of the best treatment options

Background: Current risk stratification strategies for coronary artery disease (CAD) have low predictive value in asymptomatic patients classified as 
intermediate Framingham risk Metabolomic approach, in addition to detailed anatomical imaging by coronary computed tomography angiography 
(CCTA), could allow to better identify patients at risk of cardiovascular events Purpose: To analyze the overall metabolic profile within the 
tomographic Leaman (CT - LeSc) terciles on the most clinically relevant scenarios - CNvsT3, T1vsT3, CNvsT1 Methods: A total of 20 asymptomatic 
subjects classified as intermediate CAD risk according to the Framingham score with negative test for ischemia (myocardial perfusion scintigraphy), 
and normal ventricular fraction (LVEF) were recruited into four groups (CN, T1, T2, T3) according to CCTA results and evaluated by UPLC-QTOF/
MS based untargeted metabolomics, correlating to patient’s clinical data CEU Mass Mediator was used to annotate the significant metabolites 
after univariate (t-test) and multivariate non-supervised analysis for non-parametric data The lipidic profile was compared with several markers 
of CAD regarding the capacity to reclassify cardiovascular risk Results: Within the clinical phenotypes, differential metabolites were highlighted: 
i) control and higher risk subjects (T3>CN): MGDG, PS (22:0); ii) higher vs lower risk subjects (T3>T1): LysoPI (22:1), DG (34:2), iii) subtle clinical 
phenotypes (T1>CN): SM (d44:1) Conclusion(s): Metabolomics approach may be useful in clinical practice as a powerful tool for the prediction of 
CAD in asymptomatic subjects The tomography Leaman phenotypes showed discriminant metabolite findings as associated with abnormal lipid 
metabolism and atherosclerosis early formation, enabling a molecular possibility of complementary re-classification of vulnerable subjects

Background: Early detection of atherosclerotic process is crucial for primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases Subjects and methods: We 
investigated predictive ability of serum lipidome using LC-MS/MS technique for subclinical atherosclerosis assessed by carotid intima-media 
thickness (cIMT) in Young Finns Study cohort in 2007 (number:2009, age:30-45 years, women:55%) Statistical analysis was done with dichotomized 
cIMT data (cases: value >= 90th percentile vs controls: value <90th percentile) Differential expression analysis of lipidome data between cases 
and controls was performed with Student’s t-test Differentially expressed lipid species were selected for prediction models  Reference predictive 
model with major traditional risk factors and two test predictive models; one with lipid species and traditional risk factors (test model1) and other 
with lipid species only (test model 2) were analyzed Model fitting and validation was done for 1000 bootstraps of original data by: i) fitting models to
