### Investigated and Elucidated

To gain insights into the changes in biochemical pathways in cancer tissues, we employed untargeted metabolomics using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). The initial phase of the study focused on selecting the most suitable sample preparation method. Given the limited availability of GIST (Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor) tissue samples, our goal was to develop a method capable of extracting both polar and lipophilic metabolites from a single, small GIST specimen.

Tissue samples were homogenized with a 50:50 (v/v) mixture of methanol and water at a ratio of 1:10 (w/v). The obtained homogenate was subjected to five different extraction methods, including:
- Monophasic extraction with methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) and methanol.
- Biphasic extraction with varying ratios of MTBE, methanol, and water.
- Biphasic extraction with dichloromethane, methanol, and water.
- Two-step extraction using the same solvents.

The organic extracts were analyzed using reversed-phase liquid chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectromometry (LC-TOF-MS), while hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) separation was used for polar extracts. The criteria for selecting the sample preparation method were based on the number of features detected in the extracts and the reproducibility of the extraction procedure. The selected method will be further utilized for metabolomic fingerprinting of GIST tissue specimens, which can complement genomic studies on GIST or propose potential new therapeutic targets.

### Method Development for Determination of Modified Nucleosides and Deoxynucleosides in Urine and Plasma Samples

**Presenting Author:** Malgorzata Patejko, Medical University of Gdańsk, Poland  
**Co-Authors:** Wiktoria Struck-Lewicka, Danuta Siluk, Marcin Markuszewski

Modified nucleosides and deoxynucleosides are products of RNA and DNA turnover. These compounds are not metabolized and cannot be reused for the synthesis of RNA and DNA molecules. Instead, they are excreted in their unchanged form. Consequently, an elevated level of these compounds in urine can be correlated with the development of pathophysiological disorders. Increased levels of modified nucleosides and deoxynucleosides have been observed in various diseases, such as hepatocellular carcinoma, breast cancer, and urogenital cancer.

The aim of this study is to perform a targeted metabolomics analysis of 11 modified nucleosides and deoxynucleosides in urine and plasma samples collected from bladder cancer patients using LC-QqQ/MS. Proper sample treatment significantly influences the results, so the first task was to develop a sample preparation procedure. This included optimizing separation conditions and solid-phase extraction (SPE).

Different chromatographic conditions were compared, including the type of stationary phase, flow rate, column temperature, and gradient program. Due to differences in the sugar moiety between nucleosides and deoxynucleosides, there are challenges in selecting a sorbent that can extract both types simultaneously. Previously, nucleosides and deoxynucleosides were often analyzed separately. The goal was to develop a method for the simultaneous extraction of both from urine and plasma. Various sorbents were evaluated based on their selectivity, recovery, and ability to extract modified nucleosides and deoxynucleosides. The method based on the selected sorbent was further optimized.

**Presenting Author:** Chul-Ho Jeong, College of Pharmacy, Keimyung University, South Korea  
**Co-Authors:** Won-Jun Jang, Ji Hae Seo

Metabolomics can provide valuable insights into the phenotypic changes that occur during the acquisition of drug resistance and metabolic alterations in cancer cells. Understanding the metabolic changes induced by altered glycolytic pathways in cancer cells is crucial for overcoming drug resistance in various cancers.

In this study, we performed mass spectrometry-based targeted metabolic profiling to compare the metabolic changes in oral cancer cells (SCC15) following treatment with 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG), 2-DG + pyruvate, and 2-DG + mannose. We quantified and statistically compared five groups of metabolites: acylcarnitines, amino acids and biogenic amines, glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, and monosaccharides.

Our targeted metabolomic analyses revealed significant changes in the metabolic pathways involved in the regulation of amino acids (15), polyamines (1), and fatty acids (3). Significant decreases in the levels of amino acids and polyamines, and significant increases in the levels of lysophosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylcholine, and sphingomyelin were observed in 2-DG-treated SCC15 cells. Additionally, treatment with pyruvate or mannose significantly restored the metabolic changes in 2-DG-treated SCC15 cells.

This study highlights the increased metabolic demands reflecting changes in glycolysis-related amino acid metabolism, which may enhance our understanding of metabolic alterations in cancer.

**Presenting Author:** Kristian Pirttilä, Uppsala University, Sweden  
**Co-Authors:** Ylva Tiblom Ehrsson, Göran Laurell, Mikael Hedeland, Torbjörn Arvidsson, Curt Pettersson

Patients with head and neck cancer (HNC) often experience unintentional weight loss, and cancer cachexia is prevalent. This pilot study is part of a multi-center study of HNC patients in Sweden. The aim was to investigate the correlation between the plasma metabolome at different time points and the weight change of patients.

Plasma samples from 31 patients, taken at three different time points (at diagnosis, 7 weeks after treatment started, and 12 weeks after treatment ended), were analyzed using a HILIC-UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS protocol. The treatment modalities varied, but 27 out of the 31 patients received radiotherapy. The metabolome at different time points and changes between time points were correlated using orthogonal projection to latent structures (OPLS) with a weight outcome factor calculated for each patient based on clinical measurements.

A correlation with weight outcome was found in the 7-week (R² = 0.807, Q² = 0.412, p = 0.07) and 12-week follow-up samples (R² = 0.679, Q² = 0.361, p < 0.05). This study provides preliminary evidence of the metabolic changes associated with weight loss in HNC patients, which may help in developing strategies to manage cancer cachexia.

**Presenting Author:** Nikolaos G Bliziotis, Radboud umc, Netherlands  
**Co-Authors:** Jaap Deinum, Graeme Eisenhofer, Maria-Christina Zennaro, Paolo Mulatero, Alek Prejbisz, Felix Beuschlein, Martin Fassnacht, Livia Lenzini, Michael Conall Dennedy, Marco Boscaro, Filippo Ceccato, Gian Paolo Rossi, JM Connell, Tracy Williams, Michel Azizi, Laurence Amar, Jérôme Bertherat, Anne-Paule Gimenez Roqueplo, Casper K Larsen, Eleanor Davies, Udo FH Engelke, Ron A Wevers, Leo AJ Kluijtmans, Henri JLM Timmers

**Background:** The ENSAT-HT project aims to establish a biomarker signature for different forms of adrenal hypertension (AHT) using a multi-omics approach, including untargeted plasma metabolomics. Our goal is to define the metabolic signature of AHT patients suffering from Primary Aldosteronism (PA, n=106), Cushing’s Syndrome (CS, n=39), or Pheochromocytoma and Paraganglioma (PPGL, n=98), and compare it to primary hypertensives (PHT, n=109) and healthy volunteers (HV, n=133).

**Methods:** Heparinized plasma samples were collected from all study subjects and analyzed in a randomized order, along with quality controls (QC), using proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy (1H-NMR). The resulting spectra were processed and converted to a readable table using multivariate statistical analysis (MVA) tools. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to check for outliers and trends within the dataset, and Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) was used to build a sample classification model.

**Results:** The PCA score plot of NMR plasma data showed a tight clustering of QC samples, indicating the analytical robustness of the method. A PLS-DA model was built for classifying samples as either PHT or AHT with an accuracy of >80%.

**Conclusions:** A reliable NMR metabolomics approach was applied to human plasma samples. The initial analysis suggests that patient classification based on the presence of either adrenal or primary hypertension is feasible. Future plans include diminishing the effects of confounders and applying Multilevel MVA methods to delineate the pathophysiological mechanisms of AHT.

Dyslipidemia, characterized by lipoprotein overproduction or deficiency, is a significant risk factor for coronary heart disease and stroke. Metabolomics information about dyslipidemic patients is still limited. Patients who do not respond to or are intolerant of statins often undergo lipoprotein apheresis (LA) to lower LDL levels. LA exerts pleiotropic effects, altering various blood components.

We performed a multi-parametric assessment of inflammatory markers, PCSK-9 levels, and metabolic and proteomic profiles of dyslipidemic patients undergoing LA to gain insights into the effects of LA and to better understand the disease. Serum samples from 9 patients undergoing three consecutive LA (B. Braun) procedures were assayed. Samples were collected before and after each procedure. Nuclear magnetic resonance and ESI-Q-ToF LC/MS were used to assess metabolomic and proteomic patterns, respectively. Lipid profile and PCSK-9 levels were biochemically measured.

In addition to the expected depletion of lipoprotein-related proteins and PCSK-9 levels, we observed a reduction in complement- and inflammation-related proteins after each LA procedure. We identified around 50 soluble metabolites defining the metabolic baseline profile of dyslipidemic patients (before LA treatment). LA influenced the patient's proteomic pattern but had no impact on intermediate and final products of metabolic pathways. For 3 out of the 9 patients, we identified the accumulation of branched-chain amino acids. The integration of metabolomics with other omics-based approaches is relevant for identifying clinical markers to support physicians in choosing the best treatment options.

### Metabolomics Approach Coupled with Leaman Score to Re-Stratify Coronary Artery Plaque Burden: A Translational Pilot Study with Asymptomatic Subjects of Intermediate Cardiovascular Risk

**Presenting Author:** Aline Martins, Universidad CEU San Pablo, Spain  
**Co-Authors:** Mariana Ubaldo Barbosa Paiva, Diego Viana Neves Paiva, Henrique Louzan Machado, Leonardo Jadyr Silva Rodrigues Alves, Fabio Neves dos Santos, Marcos Nogueira Eberlin, Carolina Raíssa Costa Picossi, Guilherme Urpia Monte, Fernando Antibas Atik, Carolina Gonzalez-Riaño, Francisco J. Ruperez, Coral Barbas, Aline Maria Araújo Martins

**Background:** Current risk stratification strategies for coronary artery disease (CAD) have low predictive value in asymptomatic patients classified as intermediate Framingham risk. A metabolomic approach, combined with detailed anatomical imaging by coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA), could improve the identification of patients at risk of cardiovascular events.

**Purpose:** To analyze the overall metabolic profile within the tomographic Leaman (CT - LeSc) terciles on the most clinically relevant scenarios (CN vs. T3, T1 vs. T3, CN vs. T1).

**Methods:** A total of 20 asymptomatic subjects classified as intermediate CAD risk according to the Framingham score, with negative tests for ischemia (myocardial perfusion scintigraphy) and normal ventricular fraction (LVEF), were recruited into four groups (CN, T1, T2, T3) based on CCTA results. The samples were evaluated using UPLC-QTOF/MS-based untargeted metabolomics, correlating with patient clinical data. CEU Mass Mediator was used to annotate significant metabolites after univariate (t-test) and multivariate non-supervised analysis for non-parametric data. The lipid profile was compared with several markers of CAD regarding the capacity to reclassify cardiovascular risk.

**Results:** Within the clinical phenotypes, differential metabolites were highlighted:
- Control and higher-risk subjects (T3 > CN): MGDG, PS (22:0).
- Higher vs. lower-risk subjects (T3 > T1): LysoPI (22:1), DG (34:2).
- Subtle clinical phenotypes (T1 > CN): SM (d44:1).

**Conclusion(s):** A metabolomics approach may be useful in clinical practice as a powerful tool for predicting CAD in asymptomatic subjects. The tomographic Leaman phenotypes showed discriminant metabolite findings associated with abnormal lipid metabolism and early atherosclerosis formation, enabling a molecular possibility of complementary re-classification of vulnerable subjects.

### Lipidome Improves Predictive Ability of Subclinical Atherosclerosis Over Traditional Risk Factors: The Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study

**Presenting Author:** Pashupati Mishra, Tampere University, Finland  
**Co-Authors:** Pashupati P. Mishra, Leo-Pekka Lyytikäinen, Binisha H. Mishra, Mika Kähönen, Olli T. Raitakari, Reijo Laaksonen, Terho Lehtimäki

**Background:** Early detection of the atherosclerotic process is crucial for the primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases.

**Subjects and Methods:** We investigated the predictive ability of the serum lipidome using LC-MS/MS for subclinical atherosclerosis, assessed by carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) in the Young Finns Study cohort in 2007 (number: 2009, age: 30-45 years, women: 55%). Statistical analysis was done with dichotomized cIMT data (cases: value ≥ 90th percentile vs. controls: value < 90th percentile). Differential expression analysis of lipidome data between cases and controls was performed using Student’s t-test. Differentially expressed lipid species were selected for prediction models. Reference predictive models with major traditional risk factors and two test predictive models (one with lipid species and traditional risk factors, and another with lipid species only) were analyzed. Model fitting and validation were done for 1000 bootstraps of the original data.

**Results:** The inclusion of the lipidome in the predictive models significantly improved the ability to predict subclinical atherosclerosis over traditional risk factors alone.

**Conclusion:** The lipidome provides additional predictive power for subclinical atherosclerosis, enhancing the effectiveness of current risk stratification strategies.
