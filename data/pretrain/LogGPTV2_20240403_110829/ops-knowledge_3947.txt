Certainly! Here's a more polished and coherent version of your text:

In my C++ application, which runs on Ubuntu and utilizes `nfqueue`, I send packets using raw sockets to another computer. The receiving computer then processes these packets and sends a response back, which is written to yet another computer using raw sockets.

I need to test the packets sent from both `computer1` and `computer2` to ensure they meet the expected criteria (e.g., IP addresses, ports, and payload). To achieve this, I am looking for a simple and automated solution to listen to the Ethernet interface, capture the sent packets, and verify their contents.

### Requirements:
1. **Automation Test**: The test should automatically listen to the Ethernet interface, capture the sent packets, and check if they match the expected values.
2. **Tool or Code**: A tool with a simple API or a code snippet that can be integrated into my testing framework.
3. **Language Flexibility**: The test application can be written in C++, Java, or Python.

### Preferred Approach:
- **Sender Verification**: Ideally, the test should verify the packets at the sender side. However, finding an API to listen to the Ethernet interface for raw sockets might be challenging.
- **Receiver Verification**: As an alternative, a solution that verifies the received packets on the receiver side is also acceptable.

### Current Approach:
- **tcpdump**: I currently use `tcpdump` on the receiver computer to capture all packets and save them to a file.
- **Analysis with Python**: I then analyze the captured packets using a Python script to ensure they were sent as expected.

### Request:
I am seeking a simpler and more automated way to perform this verification. Any suggestions for tools or code snippets that can help me achieve this would be greatly appreciated.
