Question: "In a GraphQL API, a query named 'dogs' accepts a 'namePrefix' parameter that is concatenated in an SQL query to retrieve dog records. Given the information on how this parameter is handled, what type of security vulnerability is the API likely to be exposed to?"
 "A": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) because the 'namePrefix' is reflected in the output without proper encoding."
 "B": "SQL Injection as the 'namePrefix' user input is directly concatenated into the SQL query without sanitization."
 "C": "Denial of Service (DoS) as the 'namePrefix' could be used to create deeply nested queries that overload the server."
 "D": "Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) because the 'namePrefix' could allow access to unauthorized dog records."
Answer: B
