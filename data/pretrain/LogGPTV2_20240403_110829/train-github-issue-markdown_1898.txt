I have hooked up Deno to lint source files on-demand. But there are numerous
linting rules which we, as a company, need to ignore. Adding them to _every
single source file_ would be highly cumbersome, and undesirable. I will
absolutely get push back from developers who will simply refuse to lint their
code entirely.
Is it possible to provide a global list of ignore rules for `deno lint` in the
command line, either with an option or file listing the rules to ignore? If
not, could this be added? These would have to be ignored for the purpose of
reporting unused ignore rules actually embedded in the file.
Currently I have to do a kludge that involves prepending each file to be
linted with my global list of directives to ignore, which means (a) that error
lines are out by 1 because Deno sees the ignore line as part of the input
source, (b) Deno reports a bunch of `(ban-unused-ignore)` errors, and (c) the
reported filename is `stdin` instead of the actual file being linted (which
breaks the editor link to the file & line in error).
