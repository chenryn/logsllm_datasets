Hello,

I am currently searching for information on atrous (dilated) transposed convolutions but have found limited resources. In the documentation for `tf.nn.atrous_conv2d`, there is a brief mention:

> "When used in conjunction with bilinear interpolation, it provides an alternative to `conv2d_transpose` for dense prediction tasks such as semantic image segmentation, optical flow computation, or depth estimation."

However, it is not entirely clear how to implement this, and it seems that TensorFlow may not yet support transposed atrous convolutions directly. Could you provide any guidance or additional resources on this topic?

Thank you.
