# graph-merge operator (Preview)
> [!WARNING]
> This feature is currently in preview and might be subject to change. The semantics and syntax of the graph feature might change before they are released as generally available.
The `graph-merge` operator merges the nodes and edges of two graphs, combining them into a single new graph.
> [!NOTE]
> This operator is used in conjunction with the [make-graph operator](make-graph-operator.md).
## Syntax
*LeftGraph* `|` `graph-merge` *RightGraph* [ `on` *Attributes* ]
## Parameters
| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|--|--|--|--|
| *LeftGraph* | `string` |  :heavy_check_mark: | The left graph. Denoted as `$left`. |
| *RightGraph* | `string` |  :heavy_check_mark: | The right graph. Denoted as `$right`. |
| *Attributes* | `string` | | One or more comma-separated rules that determine how edges from *LeftGraph* are matched with edges from *RightGraph*. If the columns to match have the same name in both graphs, use the syntax `on` *ColumnName*. Otherwise, use the syntax `on` `$left.`*LeftColumn* `==` `$right.`*RightColumn*. Multiple rules are evaluated using the `and` logical operator.|
## Returns
The graph merge operator combines nodes and edges from two origin graphs into a new graph, adhering to specified merge rules.
In the absence of any rules, the edges are unionized rather than merged.
## Examples
The following examples build a graph from emails and aliases tables and another graph for calls and employees' first and last names. The `make-graph` operators build the two graphs. Then, each example shows a different usage of `graph-merge`.
### Merge without attributes
Since *Attributes* aren't specified, the edges of the new graph are the union of the edges from both the source graphs.

### Merge with attributes
Since *Attributes* are specified, the edges are merged based on source and destination of the emails and calls. Meaning, all edges with the same source and destination are merged into a single edge.
