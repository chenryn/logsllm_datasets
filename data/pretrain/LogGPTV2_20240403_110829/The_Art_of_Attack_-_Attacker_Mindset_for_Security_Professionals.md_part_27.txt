a professional. This automatic tendency for people to trust
what they see helps us pass a thin- slice assessment and ulti-
mately leads to success.
Default to Truth
As Tim Levine, author of Duped: Truth- Default Theory and the Social
Science of Lying and Deception (University of Alabama Press, 2019)
ultimately proved, humans tend to default to truth. Let me explain.
Overwhelmingly, our human tendency is to operate on the
assumption that the people we are dealing with are straightforward
and trustworthy. Although this instinct will always leave us open to
deception, and even facilitates it, it also underpins nearly all of our
initial interactions with one another and, as such, enables friend-
ships to form, relationships to start, business to be conducted, and
society to operate. The consequence of not defaulting to truth is
that, if you don’t begin in a state of trust, you can’t have meaning-
ful social interaction. There are people who do not operate through
Psychology in Attacks 237
this tendency. If you have ever met someone who seems to offer up
acute analytical inspection at every word you say and every action
you take, you will know it is tiring and difficult to build and cultivate
any sort of meaningful, symbiotic relationship. The simplest of pro-
cesses in society could not take place as they do if we all functioned
with such conspicuous distrust at every turn and every encounter.
Moreover, evolution should have favored people with the abil-
ity to pick up the signs of deception, and yet here we are— still all
pretty terrible at knowing whether someone is lying. We are able to
pick up signs of comfort or discomfort, but we aren’t able to pick
out a lie. This is counterintuitive and, upon first inspection, seems
to not make any sense at all. Surely suspicion and caution would
fit us best in this dangerous world. Alas, we are more inclined to
assume someone is telling us the truth. It may be that evolution
cannot give us the ability to tell whether a lie is being told because
every lie we hear comes with different signage and indicators or
because every person’s tells are too different. Or it could be that
always knowing when an individual is lying is not needed. Cata-
strophic lies are rare and often told by a very small subset of people,
so defaulting to truth makes sense for us in terms of building soci-
eties and thriving as a race. Or my favorite theory: the reason we
haven’t evolved to tell when someone is lying with precision could
be many reasons combined.
Knowing that operating under this default to truth tendency is
socially necessary, we can begin to look at ways to exploit it as an
attacker and also, at the end, stop it from becoming such a vulner-
ability for businesses and people. We’ve discussed, thanks to Dan-
iel Kahneman’s brilliant work, especially that written in Thinking,
Fast and Slow (Farrar, Straus, and Giroux, 2013), how we can get
by people as long as we don’t snap them out of their “System 1”
thinking (automatic, intuitive, and unconscious mode) into System
2 (slow, controlled, and analytical method of thinking; uses reason-
ing). This means we have to operate in a way that is congruent with
our presented selves. It means adhering to law 3—n ever break-
ing pretext— never uncloaking yourself as a threat. The default to
238 TOOLS AND ANATOMY
truth tendency, as defined by Tim Levine, is an extension of this. To
snap a target out of truth- default mode takes large and conspicu-
ous deviation from what you are presenting as. This is not to say a
target won’t have suspicions or doubts— they may. It is your job, via
the laws and skills of AMs, to win them over. What refraining from
snapping someone out of this tendency means is that you cannot
do something so egregiously incongruent that they fall out of truth-
default mode. People will forgive little incongruencies, because as
humans we often rationalize things away. We start out by believ-
ing people and we end supposing deceit over truth only when our
doubts and uncertainties grow to a point where we can no longer
rationalize or explain incongruencies away.
Imagine you had to analyze whether your grandfather was a
spy. Let’s assume he could speak multiple languages, was very pri-
vate, did not like his picture to be taken, and did not want to be in
the background of pictures, especially if they were going to be posted
on social media. Imagine he was against social media altogether,
but you often found him perusing it, looking at foreign countries—
not as himself, of course. Let’s go further and imagine that when-
ever you asked him what his job was, his answer didn’t make sense:
imagine he traveled a lot for “an electrician.” Imagine you found
items that you could identify as ways to bug people— devices that
were small and nifty. Now imagine you asked him about all of
those things, and he said his expectation and need for privacy was
a biproduct of his generation and upbringing. . .that he did not like
the way he looked in pictures. . .and that he liked the thought of get-
ting news from locals, a sentiment he remembered his own father
longed for as an immigrant but without access to social media.
Imagine he said he traveled because there was no work as an elec-
trician at the rates he charged in the immediate vicinity. Moreover,
he works big jobs, generally for large buildings that make staying
beside the facility easier. And imagine he had a hobby that made
him want to dismantle small, wily devices that outdated your time
on Earth. Great; truth- default mode says you will rationalize what
he says with what he does. But actually, your grandfather is a spy.
It’s not until he is caught and on the news that you think to yourself,
Psychology in Attacks 239
“I feel like I knew that the whole time.” Also, “How much is bail
from the Soviets?”
Truth- default mode is a powerful cognitive bias. The only way
to stop from becoming a liability to businesses is to teach people,
through behavioral security, that defense starts in the brain—t hat
there are no circumstances in which security protocols can be
bypassed. If the security protocols are lacking, then these too must
be fixed. The people, more pointedly us as ethical attackers, are not
the target’s immediate family. We deserve no rationalization.
Summary
• Humans are vulnerable to dishonesty and strong narratives. An
attacker can leverage this knowledge for their own gain.
• Part of an attacker’s arsenal is being able to think like the people
and businesses they are targeting.
• Building knowledge of fundamental human tendencies and
biases is vital.
• You can use many biases against your targets, not only the ones
listed within this book. Use AMs to look at them and tie them to
your objective as they pertain to the target.
Key Message
Use thin- slice assessments to your advantage in two ways: know
how to perform them to get accurate readings, and know that they
will likely be performed on you. Be prepared for that, and use every
tool and technique at your disposal to avoid exposure as an imposter.

Staying Protected—
The Individual
Attacker Mindset for Ordinary People
As we’ve discussed previously in this book, there’s a large discon-
nect for most people—t he Internet is still another world, not quite
in the real world. This allows most people to think the bad things
that happen on the Internet often have no real consequences here,
in this world. The digital realm as a whole seems to be up against
some modern- day folklore. A failing to bridge this gap for the
individual is cause for concern. I believe our duty as functioning
members of this community—a community built to secure other
communities— is to raise awareness among the masses that have no
insight into our world and to help them also think like an attacker,
just with more everyday utility. Teaching people this way of thinking
will also bolster our efforts from within the community—educating
people so they can more readily identify and respond to attacks.
As an individual, maybe you are very security- conscious and
security- aware. Maybe your cyber hygiene is the stuff of legend. In
that case, you may stop the phish, but will your bank or cell phone
company? If they don’t, your data can still be given to an attacker,
and you are then compromised, which is where learning about
security and privacy (separate, but related categories of security) is
helpful, which I will talk about later in this chapter.

244 AFTER AMs
Moreover some factions are acutely susceptible, such as
the elderly, who may not be tech savvy and are often targeted
because they tend to have their financial affairs in order, making
them the ideal target. Socially savvy kids are also targeted often.
Children often lack experience in the world with adults outside of
their families and so can fail to understand how quickly and eas-
ily they can be manipulated by outside sources. They likely cannot
think ahead to foresee the dangers.
Regardless of whether you fall into one of these or another
category, the vastness of the Internet and the spectrum of security
techniques and advice is often daunting. It should come as no real
shock, then, that the thought of an imposter, attacker, or malicious
party existing, whose main concern is centered on gaining access
to “our” world through the Internet, is outlandish to many people.
Moreover, there are two other things that become increasingly
apparent as I talk to people outside of the infosec community. One
is that there is a yawning gap between what ordinary people value
as information that should treated as sensitive; the other is that pri-
vacy is a spectrum, not a standard. Both are cause for concern that
require different solutions.
I believe there are a few science-b ased things we should keep in
mind that will make the likelihood of a successful attack mounted
against us, either digitally or in person, much less probable. The
remainder of this chapter will cover those after briefly setting out
why information matters so much and which types matter most.
Let’s start with people and data. People are not aware of what
constitutes as sensitive data, and it can be a hard task to bring many
people around to the idea that data, or information that is seem-
ingly benign, poses a threat to them if leaked. I wrote an article
(Healthcare: Elite Data, 2020, https://www.social-e ngineer.com/
healthcare-e lite-d ata/) which you can find in the notes section of
the book (on the website) in which I stated that health data is elite
data and noted that most people can’t fathom the prospect of that
data being worth anything. People tend not to look past the obvious
when it comes to categorizing data as sensitive. Most people would
agree that a malicious actor getting their credit card information
Staying Protected— The Individual 245
would be detrimental, and that’s because the effects are tangible:
someone else having your credit card does stimulate fear— you can
guess the outcome of that, even if you still prefer bartering. In other
words, you don’t have to own a credit card to know its functionality
and what a criminal could do with it.
However, asking if it really matters if someone can find out
their blood type or weight, or that they have a +3.00 prescription
lens does not provoke the same level of anxiety or moment of sud-
den insight or discovery. Asking people if they should be concerned
if the Internet crime leagues know they’ve been treated for high
blood pressure or a broken foot five years ago raises no immediate
suspicions or fear levels. Most people don’t seem to care if a stran-
ger knows about a recent heart attack or the onset of diabetes. In
fact, most people shrug this off, wondering just how dangerous it
could be for someone to know this type of information about them.
Only after it’s pointed out that these things don’t change do people
start to think about what it would actually mean to have that data
fall into the wrong hands.
With traditional identity theft, banks and the Social Security
Administration are able to work against criminals by changing
details for us if our identities are stolen. However, health data is
unchangeable this way. We can’t change our blood type or our pre-
scription lens. Worse still, we can’t always change our mental health
status or invisible injuries, such as anxiety, depression, schizophre-
nia, or bipolar depression nor diseases we’ve had or have. Data with
any permanence makes it elite, and we, as the victims, can’t always
offset the consequences by reporting and disputing.
Taking it a step further, your genes play a massive role in who
you are and what you are capable of. If you have taken a DNA test or
something similar, your DNA has already been sequenced, at least
in part. What if someone got ahold of this and sold it. But instead of
the consequences being minor, they were published, and you had
markers for a disease that made you seem very unattractive as an
employee or for insurance (or both).
There’s something else leaked elite data brings to the table: lon-
gevity of attacks. I can vish and phish you about that every day,
246 AFTER AMs
forever. I can try as your insurance company, doctor, nurse, psy-
chiatrist, therapist, psychologist, optometrist, or pharmacist; if you
switch, I may be able to find out who you changed to and use the
unchanging data against you again. That’s the reality of the world
we live in, so it’s imperative that we all understand the risks and
where they truly lie.
If you’ve read this book so far, you now know how an attacker
thinks and targets. Apply this to your own life.
Behavioral Security
The concept of behavioral security needs one question put under
the microscope if it is to succeed as a style of protection: why do we
act in certain ways when we are being targeted? The response will
inform how we go about mitigating the risks. To begin answering
that, let’s look at human psychology from the side of the target.
There are two fundamental components of our psychology
and how they manifest as behavior. There’s a cognitive compo-
nent, which consists of your thoughts and beliefs about something.
There’s an affective component, which is how you feel about
something. These form your behavioral outcome. AMs uses those
two basic components against you as an individual, with the aim of
shaping the outcome of your behavior to their advantage.
It’s a hard game to win, mainly because you, as the target, don’t
know you are in a game. But by becoming aware of these biases
that create human vulnerability and by lessening how much value
you ascribe to interactions with strangers, and by following a pro-
cess where there is no room for an exception to the rule, you will
keep yourself safer, your employer safer, and the wider communi-
ties safer.
Defense starts in the brain. Because of this, I believe behavioral
security deserves to be taken seriously as a branch of cyber- and
information security. As I see it, and as some branches of science
see it, too, we are all chock- full of weaknesses, irrationalities, and
idiosyncrasies.
Staying Protected— The Individual 247
The best protection against a threat, physical or cyber-b ased,
ultimately depends on the individual’s own actions, knowledge,
and attitude. It would be great if we were all emotional robots in a
way; we could be programmed to act accordingly. But, as Richard
Thaler pointed out in his book Misbehaving (W. W. Norton & Com-
pany, 2016), we are not rational beings, and from this, behavioral
economics was born. Under the same lens, it’s easy to see that we as
humans do not act rationally when it comes to security. The effect
of psychological, cognitive, emotional, cultural, social factors, and
poverty of information on the decisions of individuals and insti-
tutions is often where security fails. Moreover, defense fails when
people don’t have the skills to think critically about what they’re
seeing and to examine claims of fact before accepting them as true.
When we fully recognize this and put in place cognitive defenses,
as well as physical and digital, our security posture as a whole will
shift, helping you as a person, businesses, and communities as a
whole get ahead of the attacker. The first step in building these cog-
nitive defenses is to become familiar with how we are vulnerable to
cognitive attacks.
We often act, or react, because we feel a certain way, and as you
should know by now, the attacker mindset used in conjunction with
social engineering is an effective tool for making a target feel the
way the attacker needs them to feel to get their job done— whether
it be fearful, joyful, or compelled. We can look at behavioral security
in terms of irrational behavior and search for ways to counteract
that behavior. Alas, we are all at risk of being a target, so target
psychology is well worth our consideration, and combating weak-
nesses through behavioral security is the solution. The promise
of behavioral security as applied to policy is to use people’s weak-
nesses to help them achieve their business’s goals. Make security
seem simple and automatic. From things like the wording of poli-
cies to how they are disseminated, security must be shaped to make
it easy to understand, remember, and act on. Behavioral security
will allow us, as security professionals, to cease treating security
only through ineffective technological defensive measures and start
looking at the psychology of an attack and place defenses there, too.
248 AFTER AMs
We must take security and mold it for human behavior, not just for
technological pursuits of crime.
When Thaler coined the concept of mental accounting, he
stated that people think of value in relative terms and not in abso-
lute terms; they gain pleasure from how good the deal is, not just
from an object’s value. According to this theory of mental account-
ing, people treat money differently, depending on things like the
money’s origin and intended use, rather than thinking of money as
