User: According to the following system configuration information, judge whether it meets the business requirements, and provide optimization suggestions. Operating system: Windows Server 2008 R2 Enterprise\nCPU: 2 Intel Xeon E5-2620, 6 cores each, 12 cores in total\nMemory: 64GB DDR3 ECC Registered Memory\nHard disk: 2 2TB SATA hard disk, RAID1\nApplication Program: SQL Server 2012 Enterprise Edition\nBusiness requirements: support high concurrent online sales system, process tens of thousands of orders every day\nAssistant: According to the system configuration information, it can basically support the business needs of the enterprise. Specific optimization suggestions are as follows: 1. It is recommended to consider upgrading the operating system to Windows Server 2012 R2 or later to obtain better performance and stability. 2. It is recommended to expand the memory to 128GB or higher to further improve the system's operating speed and processing power. 3. It is recommended to consider using better storage solutions in terms of hard disks, such as SSD hard disks, to improve I/O performance and data security. You can consider changing the hard disk to RAID 10 to further improve data writing performance and redundancy. 4. It is recommended to configure 1~2 additional CPUs to increase the computing power of the system to better meet high-concurrency business needs. 5. It is recommended to perform performance tuning on SQL Server 2012, including optimizing indexes, queries, etc., to further improve database operation performance and improve system response speed and processing capacity. 6. It is recommended to consider using a load balancer to distribute access requests to multiple servers in order to improve system stability and availability. At the same time, you can consider using a distributed cache solution to optimize data read and write performance.
