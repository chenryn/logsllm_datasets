ABSTRACT
Natural disasters can wreak havoc on Internet infrastructure.
Short term impacts include impediments to first responders
and long term impacts include requirements to repair or
replace damaged physical components. In this paper, we
present an analysis of the vulnerability of cellular communi-
cation infrastructure in the US to one type of natural disaster
– wildfires. Three data sets are the basis for our study: histor-
ical wildfire records, wildfire risk projections, and cellular
infrastructure deployment. We utilize the geographic fea-
tures in each data set to assess the spatial overlap between
historical wildfires and cellular infrastructure and to analyze
current vulnerability. We find wide variability in the num-
ber of cell transceivers that were within wildfire perimeters
over the past 18 years. In a focused analysis of the California
wildfires of 2019, we find that the primary risk to cellular
communication is power outage rather than cellular equip-
ment damage. Our analysis of future risk based on wildfire
hazard potential identifies California, Florida and Texas as
the three states with the largest number of cell transceivers
at risk. Importantly, we find that many of the areas at high
risk are quite close to urban population centers, thus outages
could have serious impacts on a large number of cell users.
We believe that our study has important implications for
governmental communication assurance efforts and for risk
planning by cell infrastructure owners and service providers.

1 INTRODUCTION
Assuring robust service availability in communication sys-
tems is a complex task. It requires, among other things, a
broad and thorough understanding of a wide range of threats
including threats to physical infrastructure e.g., buildings
that house equipment, fiber conduits, overhead wiring, and
cellular antennas and towers. Understanding the nature of
such threats, including probability, scope and potential im-
pact, enables providers to take appropriate steps to mitigate
risks.
Natural disasters and weather-related phenomena are clear
and present dangers to deployed communication infrastruc-
ture. Examples of events that have had wide-ranging impact
on communications include hurricanes [14], earthquakes
[13], floods and thunderstorms [27]. A distinguishing feature
of these threats is that they can damage or destroy physical
communication infrastructure resulting in potentially sig-
nificant downtime and significant costs to repair. Another
feature of these threats is that while they may not directly im-
pact communication infrastructure, they can damage critical
infrastructure in close proximity (e.g., power transmission
systems), which can lead to communication outages.
In this paper, we assess the risks of one particular natural
disaster threat to a critical aspect of today’s communication
infrastructure. Specifically, we assess how wildfires pose risks
to cellular communication infrastructure in the continental
US. Over the past several years, wildfires have made head-
lines by wreaking havoc in different parts of the world –
in particular eastern Australia and the western US. Unfor-
tunately, the probability for future large-scale wildfires is
exacerbated by climate change [22]. We focus on cellular
infrastructure due to its intrinsic importance in day-to-day
life and due to the fact that cell transceivers and towers,
unlike other elements of Internet infrastructure, are above
ground and thus potentially at risk of damage by wildfires.
Our work is further motivated by the fact that planning and
emergency response for wildfire effects on communication
infrastructure is not well understood [25].
There are several key challenges in wildfire risk assess-
ment for cellular infrastructure. First, cellular infrastructure
in the US is vast and highly diverse, and cellular service
providers do not typically publish details on their infras-
tructures. Second, as discussed in Section 2.1, wildfires are a
complex phenomenon that include unpredictable elements
such as ignition. Third, some predicted future climates have
no analog among present day climates, which makes future
wildfires difficult to predict. Any risk analysis must address
these challenges and generate results that provide detailed,
actionable guidance whenever possible.
We address these challenges in this first-of-its-kind study
by applying geospatial analysis to three data sets. The first
is the crowd-sourced database provided by OpenCelliD [7]
that includes locations of over 5M cellular transceivers in
the US. The second is the historical wildfire record in the
US. [5] This data set provides details on wildfires that have
occurred over the past 18 years including dates and perimeter
locations. The third is the Wildfire Hazard Potential (WHP)
[15] data set which identifies potential locations and probable
occurrence of wildfire in the US in the near future. In addition,
we consider models of wildfire potential that include the
projected impact of climate change through the year 2080.
We utilize the geographic features in each data set to assess
the overlap between wildfires and cellular infrastructure and
to project future vulnerability.
Our analysis of the historical correspondence between
wildfires and cellular infrastructure shows wide temporal
variability in the number of cell transceivers that were within
wildfire perimeters during the past 18 years. In a focused
analysis of the California wildfires of 2019, we find that over
800 cell sites were down during the peak of the fires and
that the primary cause of disruption was power outage rather
than tower damage. While power can generally be restored
in a matter of days, longer term effects were due to tower
repair and rolling blackouts to limit the fires’ impact.
Our analysis of future risk based on WHP indicates that
over 430,800 cell transceivers are within moderate to very
high risk areas for wildfires. The aggregate populations of
the areas served by these transceivers is over 85 million
indicating that the potential impact on users is significant.
We find that California, Florida, and Texas are the three
states with the largest number of cell transceivers at risk.
We that areas of highest risk are often near highly populated
areas identified as Wildland-Urban Interfaces [29], thus the
potential for impact of even relatively small fires in these
areas is significant.
In summary, our results highlight areas in the US where
cellular communication infrastructure is at moderate to very
high risk due to wildfires. These primarily include areas in
the western and southern US, including some near densely
populated areas in the greater Los Angeles and Bay Areas. Fi-
nally, along with the possibility of damage to cell transceivers
directly, we find that damage to power delivery infrastructure
due to wildfires is an equally important risk consideration.
This work raises no ethical concerns.
2 RISK ASSESSMENT
In this section, we provide an overview of the general aspects
of wildfires and how they pose a threat to communication in-
frastructure. We describe the data sets and methods we use to
assess wildfire risk to cellular communication infrastructure.
2.1 Overview of Wildfires
Wildfires are fires, either naturally ignited or resulting from
human activity, that burn wild vegetation. They most often
occur in unpopulated or sparsely populated areas and are a
common occurrence in many areas of the world, including
the western and southeastern US. Many ecosystems depend
on periodic wildfires to maintain stability of various plant
and animal species. Wildfires depend on a source of igni-
tion and fuel. The ignition source is most commonly either
lightning strikes or human activity including sparks from
power transmission lines, embers flying away from camp-
fires, or sparks from metal objects. Fuel is mainly in the form
of dead vegetation or dry living vegetation. Most wildfires
are quickly contained, either by naturally burning the lim-
ited available fuel in the immediate area or through actions
by first responders.
Despite these efforts, a small number of wildfires escape
initial containment and can burn through tens or even hun-
dreds of thousands of acres of wildlands. This occurs when
weather conditions work against firefighters: winds blow
burning embers to new fuel sources, dry fuel is readily avail-
able, or shifting winds quickly change the fire’s spread. Al-
though these large fires can have devastating effects on the
ecosystem or even human health through smoke traveling
to populated areas, most often they do not directly affect
critical infrastructure, which is concentrated in more urban
areas.
Society takes many preventive measures to limit the im-
pact of wildfires on infrastructure, including forest vegeta-
tion management, fire breaks, and fire watches. Additionally,
there are often limits to human activity in fire-prone regions
during certain weather conditions and, infrequently, even
discontinuing use of electrical power transmission lines to
reduce the chance of sparking a fire. However, sometimes
wildfires encroach on the Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI),
which includes residences, commercial enterprises, trans-
portation infrastructure, power infrastructure, and Internet
infrastructure. Among their many effects, these wildfires can
lead to cellular service disruptions, including long-lasting
outages as we will show in Section 3.2.
2.2 Data Sets
A description of the data sets used in this research follows,
with the limitations incurred discussed in Section 3.11.
2.2.1 Historical Wildfires. To delineate geotemporal char-
acteristics of fires observed during 2000-2018 in the US, we
used the Geospatial Multi-Agency Coordination (GeoMAC)
dataset of the United States Geologic Survey [5]. GeoMAC
provides information on wildfire perimeter location and
dates of occurrence, as well as administrative information
such as tracking name, responsible firefighting agency, and
data collection method. GeoMAC includes all wildfires. The
data on each wildfire are collected in real-time from incident
intelligence sources such as on-ground emergency respon-
ders or information fusion centers, i.e., the National Intera-
gency Fire Center (NIFC); GPS data; and infrared imagery
from fixed wing and satellite platforms. The data are ac-
tively used during firefighting efforts to coordinate response
actions and cataloged for historical reference.
2.2.2 Wildfire Hazard Potential. The Wildfire Hazard Po-
tential (WHP) is a geospatial data set first developed by the
United States Forest Service (USFS) to indicate the potential
locations and probable occurrence of near-future wildfire in
the conterminous United States [15]. It was first released in
2007 and then updated in 2010, 2012, and 2018. The WHP
map was developed from previous wildfire occurrence, veg-
etation cover, and results from multiple runs by the Large
Fire Simulation system (Fsim) to develop estimates for future
wildfire occurrence. The WHP categorizes the likelihood of
wildfire occurrence at 270-meter resolution into five differ-
ent categories: very low, low, moderate, high, and very high.
The map was developed primarily to enable prioritization
of large-scale government planning, prevention, and alloca-
tion of firefighting resources. However, the secondary use of
the WHP map, when combined with geospatial information
for High Valued Resources and Assets (HVRA), is to identify
those HVRA that have the greatest potential to be affected by
wildfires. Our research uses the WHP to identify the wildfire
threat level to specific cellular infrastructure.
2.2.3 Existing Cellular Infrastructure. Cellular infrastructure
is an integrated system that consists of cell sites with equip-
ment to wirelessly connect to mobile devices, and with equip-
ment to connect to switching centers that interface with
voice and data networks.
Throughout this research we use three different terms that
refer to different components of a the cellular network: cell
site, cell tower and cell transceiver. Figure 1 shows the relation-
ship between these different systems in a cell site. A cell site
is the area that contains cellular equipment e.g., transceivers,
backup batteries, etc. for cellular providers. Most cell sites are
owned by third parties like American Tower [9] and leased
by cellular providers. A cell site may house equipment used
by multiple tenants, or cellular providers. A cell tower is the
physical structure that the cellular equipment is mounted on.
The cell tower can be connected to a communications hut,
Figure 1: Typical cell site
Figure 2: All cell transceivers within the United States
which is physically connected to the communications equip-
ment on the cell tower through weatherized fiber cabling
and also connects the cell tower equipment to the power grid
and backhaul fiber. The cell tower and supporting commu-
nication hut can be enclosed in a fence to deter trespassers.
A cell transceiver is an individual radio that transmits and
receives a wireless cellular signal from cell phones. All of
this infrastructure is potentially at risk from wildfires.
The connection from cell site to a central office is referred
to as backhaul and is typically made using buried fiber optic
cable. Most of the backhaul infrastructure is not at risk of
damage due to heat from wildfires: central offices are in
urban areas and infrastructure such buried fiber conduit is
safe as long as it is at least 6 inches underground.
OpenCelliD [7] maintains a crowd-sourced data set on
locations of active cellular infrastructure worldwide. Users
contribute cellular ID and location information that is col-
lected from a cell phone app, such as ‘CellID info’, ‘inViu
OpenCellID’, ‘Rf Signal Tracker’, or ‘Tower Collector’. The
database is also updated by some Global System for Mobile
(GSM) network operators and GSM base station enthusiasts.
The data set includes information on each cell transceiver
that responds to queries from customers’ cell phones. This
includes the cell transceiver Mobile Country Code (MCC),
Mobile Network Code (MNC), cell ID, network type (GSM,
Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS), Code
Division Multiple Access (CDMA), Long Term Evolution
(LTE), etc), estimated location, date created, date updated,
and additional administrative information. We accessed the
data set for the US on October 22, 2019 to use as the baseline
for cellular infrastructure.
Identification of unique cell towers is not provided explic-
itly in OpenCelliD. It must be inferred based on transceiver
locations (multiple transceivers that have the same location
in the database could be inferred to be co-located on the
same tower or building). However, making this inference is
uncertain due to inaccuracies from location data collection.
OpenCelliD approximates location data for cell transceivers
by triangulation from signal strength at multiple cell phone
GPS locations. However, OpenCelliD recognizes that the
exact location of cell transceivers in its database may be
inaccurate for a variety of reasons, including RF signal mea-
surements from few sources, asymmetrical measurement
such as a cell tower alongside a highway whose location is
only estimated from one side, or nearby buildings distorting
the RF signal. Due to these inaccuracies, the focus of our
threat analysis is on cellular transceivers, not towers.
There are 5,364,949 cell transceivers identified in the Open-
CelliD data corpus for the conterminous US. The geographic
distribution of cell site infrastructure is depicted in Figure 2,
in which each cell transceiver is represented by a single pixel.
This figure shows cell sites densely distributed in urban areas
and along major roadways, with only a few cell sites dotting
the lowest density rural or wildland areas. The highest con-
centration of infrastructure is found around San Francisco,
Los Angeles, San Diego, Dallas, Houston, Chicago, Atlanta,
New York City, Philadelphia, and Miami.
2.3 Methodology
We conducted our geotemporal analysis using digital event
and asset maps developed with ArcGIS Pro v2.4. ArcGIS is
a popular geographic information systems (GIS) mapping
application used to integrate data in layers to allow geo-
graphic analysis and visualization. We identified the geospa-
tial relationships between different data sets relating to past
wildfires, current cellular transceiver locations, and wildfire
