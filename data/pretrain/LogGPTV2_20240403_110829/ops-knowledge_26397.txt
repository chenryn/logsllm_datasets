Assistant: This log chunk shows two failed attempts to authenticate users from two different IP addresses. The first attempt was for the user 'admin' from IP address 103.99.0.122, which failed twice. The second attempt was for the user 'ftp' from IP address 103.99.0.122, which also failed, followed by an attempt for the user 'monitor' from the same IP address, which also failed.
