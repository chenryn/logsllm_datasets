Question: In a review of a Struts-based web application, a developer argues that calling super.validate() is unnecessary since custom validation has been thoroughly implemented for each form. What is the most compelling counterargument to this claim?
"A": "Custom validation could overlook some generic validation rules that are provided by the Struts framework, which would be enforced by calling super.validate().",
"B": "Calling super.validate() is an outdated practice and modern Struts applications rely solely on JavaScript-based client-side validation.",
"C": "Custom validation is always preferable as it is tailored to the application's specific requirements and super.validate() would add unnecessary overhead.",
"D": "Omitting the call to super.validate() simplifies the codebase, making the application easier to maintain and reducing the likelihood of bugs."
Answer: A
