Question: "During a man-in-the-middle attack simulation, you successfully intercept the traffic between a mobile device and a web server. However, all traffic appears to be encrypted. What information can you still potentially gather despite the encryption?"
 "A": "You can extract clear text data such as usernames and passwords because MITM attacks decrypt traffic on-the-fly."
 "B": "You can obtain valuable information about the hosts involved, the protocols used, and the ports the app is communicating with."
 "C": "You can retrieve the contents of encrypted messages because the MITM position allows you to bypass TLS encryption."
 "D": "You can modify the data in transit to inject malicious payloads into the encrypted traffic without detection."
Answer: B
