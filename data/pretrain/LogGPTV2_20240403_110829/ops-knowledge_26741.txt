User: How to connect to a Linux server using SSH and perform basic server administration tasks such as file transfers, process management, and user management, etc.
Assistant: To connect to a Linux server and perform basic server administration tasks, you can use the SSH protocol. Here are the basic steps: 1. Open a terminal or command line window. 2. Enter the ssh command on the command line, followed by the username and server IP address. For example: ssh user@192.168.1.100 3. Enter the password in the pop-up window to connect to the server. 4. Once connected, you can use various commands to perform server management tasks. Here are some common server administration tasks and related commands: - File transfer: You can use the scp command to transfer files from your local computer to the server, or from the server to your local computer. For example: scp local_file user@192.168.1.100:/path/to/remote/file (transfer local file to remote server); scp user@192.168.1.100:/path/to/remote/file local_file (transfer remote server file to the local computer). - Process management: You can use the ps command to view the currently running process, and use the kill command to end the process. For example: ps aux | grep process_name (find a process and get its process ID); kill -9 pid (kill the process). - User management: You can use the adduser command to add new users, use the userdel command to delete users, and use the passwd command to change user passwords. For example: sudo adduser new_user (add new user); sudo userdel old_user (delete user); sudo passwd user_name (change user password). The above are some basic server management tasks and related commands, you can use other commands to perform more complex tasks according to your needs.
