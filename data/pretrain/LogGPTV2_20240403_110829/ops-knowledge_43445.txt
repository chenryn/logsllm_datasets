User: I know you can use os.remove(myfile) to delete files. But what is the default folder location of this file? How do I change the folder directory?
Assistant: The default folder is your current working directory, likely to be where you started your python interpreter. You can check it by print(os.getcwd()) to display it.
To change the current working directory, you can run os.chdir('C:/MyFolder'), where you can swap C:/MyFolder to any desired path you want.
