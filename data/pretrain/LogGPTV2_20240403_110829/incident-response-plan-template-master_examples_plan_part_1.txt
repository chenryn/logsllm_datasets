It was last reviewed on {{REVIEW_DATE}}. It was last tested on {{TEST_DATE}}.
`TODO: Customize this plan template for your organization using instructions at https://github.com/counteractive/incident-response-plan-template.  For incident response services, or help customizing, implementing, or testing your plan, contact us at PI:EMAIL or at (888) 925-5765.`
# Assess
1. **Stay calm and professional.**
1. Gather pertinent information, _e.g._, alarms, events, data, assumptions, intuitions (**observe**).
1. Consider impact categories, below (**orient**), and determine if there is a possible incident (**decide**):
1. Initiate a response if there is an incident (**act**).  If in doubt, initiate a response. The incident commander and response team can adjust upon investigation and review.
## Assess Functional Impact
What is the direct or likely impact on your mission? (_e.g._, business operations, employees, customers, users)
* Mission/business degradation or failure: **incident!**
* None: assess information impact.
## Assess Information Impact
What is the direct or likely impact on your information/data, particularly anything sensitive? (_e.g._, PII, proprietary, financial, or healthcare data)
* Information accessed, taken, changed, or deleted: **incident!**
* None: handle via non-incident channels (_e.g._, support ticket).
**Every team member is empowered to start this process.**  If you see something, say something.
`TODO: Customize categories/severities as necessary.  This simple example (incident vs. no incident) is based on impact categories in NIST SP 800-61r2.`
# Initiate Response
## Name the Incident
Create an [simple two-word phrase](http://creativityforyou.com/combomaker.html) to refer to the incident---a codename---to use for the incident file and channel(s). `TODO: Customize incident naming procedure.`
## Assemble the Response Team
1. Page the on-duty/on-call Incident Commander. `TODO: Add Incident Commander call list or procedure`
1. **Do not** discuss the incident outside the response team unless cleared by the Incident Commander
1. Launch and/or join the response chat at {{RESPONSE_CHAT}}.  `TODO: Add response chat launch procedure.`
1. Launch and/or join the response call at {{RESPONSE_PHONE}} and/or {{RESPONSE_VTC}}.  `TODO: Add response call launch procedure.`
1. Prefer voice call, chat, and secure file exchange over any other methods.
1. **Do not** use primary email if possible.  If email is necessary, use sparingly or use {{ALTERNATE_EMAIL}}.  Encrypt emails when any participant is outside the {{ORGANIZATION_DOMAIN}} domain.  `TODO: Add alternative email details and procedure, e.g., on-demand Office 365 or GSuite`
1. **Do not** use SMS/text to communicate about the incident, unless to tell someone to move to a more secure channel.
1. Invite on-duty/on-call responders to the response call and response chat.
    * Invite the security team.  `TODO: Add security team contact list or procedure.`
    * Invite a SME for affected teams and systems.  `TODO: Add team SME contact list or procedure.`
    * Invite executive stakeholders and legal counsel at earliest opportunity, but prioritize operational responders.  `TODO: Add executive stakeholder contact list or procedure.`
1. _OPTIONAL:_ Establish an in-person collaboration room ("war room") for complex or severe incidents. `TODO: Add collaboration room procedure.`

## Establish Battle Rhythm
### Conduct Initial Response Call
1. Conduct initial call using the [initial response call structure](#reference-initial-response-call-structure)
1. Follow instructions from the Incident Commander.  If the on-duty/on-call Incident Commander does not join the call **within {{INCIDENT_COMMANDER_RESPONSE_SLA}}** and you are a trained incident commander, take command of the call.
1. Follow the [instructions for your role](#roles).
1. Follow the call and chat, and comment as appropriate.  If you are not a SME, filter input through the SME for your team if possible.
1. **Keep the call and chat active throughout the incident for event-driven communication.**
1. Schedule updates **every {{UPDATE_FREQUENCY}}** on the active bridge.
#### Reference: Initial Response Call Structure
* INCIDENT COMMANDER (IC): My name is [NAME], I am the Incident Commander.  I have designated [NAME] as Deputy, and [NAME] as Scribe. Who is on the call?
* SCRIBE: [Takes attendance]
* IC: [If missing key personnel] Deputy, please page [MISSING PERSONNEL].
* IC: [Asks questions to understand situation, symptoms, scope, vector, impact, and timeline from the incident reporter, applicable SMEs for systems and business units]
* SMEs: [Brief answers to IC's questions]
* IC:[If this is an incident]:
  * At this time, the incident summary is as follows: [reiterates summary].  The Investigation team will be led by [NAME], the Remediation team will be led by [NAME], and the Communication team will be led by [NAME].  They will coordinate team membership and report to me.  SMEs, please report to your appropriate team leader.
  * What investigation, remediation, or communication steps have already been taken? [this should be a short list, but needs to come out now]
  * This call and chat will remain up and available until incident closure, please use it for all incident related communications.  Provide real-time status updates in the chat, if possible.  Are there any questions or remaining inputs? [answers questions]
  * Team leaders, please proceed with your planned actions.  We will reconvene at [UPDATE_TIME] to discuss the status.  Thank you.
* IC: [If this is not an incident]: At this time, these facts do not rise to the level of an incident.  I will coordinate directly with the incident reporter for follow-on actions.  Thank you for your time.
#### Reference: Call Etiquette
* Join both the call and chat.
* Keep background noise to a minimum.
* Keep your microphone muted until you have something to say.
* Identify yourself when you join the call; State your name and role (_e.g._, "I am the SME for team x").
* Speak up and speak clearly.
* Be direct and factual.
* Keep conversations/discussions short and to the point.
* Bring any concerns to the Incident Commander (IC) on the call.
* Respect time constraints given by the Incident Commander.
* **Use clear terminology, and avoid acronyms or abbreviations. Clarity and accuracy is more important than brevity.**
### Conduct Response Update
* Conduct scheduled updates using the [update call structure](#reference-response-update-call-structure) every {{UPDATE_FREQUENCY}} on the active bridge. `TODO: Customize update frequency and scripts; recommend no more than twice daily.`
* Adjust frequency as necessary.
* Coordinate independent updates (_e.g._, executive, legal) as required, but as infrequently as practicable.
#### Reference: Response Update Call Structure
* INCIDENT COMMANDER (IC): Since our last scheduled update, the incident summary is as follows:
  * [Impact]
  * [Vector]
  * [Summary update]
  * [Timeline update]
* IC: Investigation team, please provide a brief update
  * INVESTIGATION LEAD: [Investigative activities or "nothing to report"]
  * What is your recommended investigations plan?
  * What investigation actions need tasking or approval?  [listen, gain consensus, task/approve]
* IC: Remediation team, please provide a brief update
  * REMEDIATION LEAD: [Remediation activities or "nothing to report"]
  * What is your recommended remediation strategy?  Strong objections? [listen, gain consensus, task/approve]
  * What remediation actions need tasking or approval?
* IC: Communication team, please provide a brief update:
  * COMMUNICATIONS LEAD: [Communication activities or "nothing to report"]
  * What is your recommended communication strategy?  Strong objections? [listen, gain consensus, task/approve]
  * What communication actions need tasking or approval?
* IC: This call and chat will remain up and available until incident closure, please use it for all incident related communications.  Provide real-time status updates in the chat, if possible.  Are there any questions or remaining inputs? [answers questions]
* IC: Team leaders, please proceed.  We will reconvene in [] to discuss the status.  Thank you.
## Monitor Scope
* Monitor the scope of the response to ensure it does not exceed the Incident Commander's span of control.
* If an incident gets sufficiently complex, and there are sufficient responders, consider spinning off sub-teams.
### Create Sub-Teams
* In preparation for complex incidents, three sub-teams are pre-defined: Investigation, Remediation, and Communication, generally responsible for those response functions. `TODO: Customize sub-team structure if necessary.`
* Create a call bridge and chat for each sub-team.
* The Incident Commander will designate team leaders, who report to the IC, and team members, who report to their team leader.  _Team leaders do not have to be trained as incident commanders, however some leadership experience is preferable._
* The Incident Commander may adjust the purpose or name of the sub-teams as necessary.
* If you wish to switch teams, ask your **current team leader**.  **Do not** ask the Incident Commander, or the leader of the other team(s).  Use the chain of command.
### Split Incident
If an incident turns out to be two or more distinct incidents:
* Establish a new [incident file](#create-incident-file).
* Track and coordinate investigation, remediation, and communication in the appropriate file.
* Consider establishing sub-teams for each incident.
* **Maintain one top-level Incident Commander**, to coordinate low-density, high-demand assets and maintain unity of command.
# Investigate
**[Investigate](#investigate), [remediate](#remediate), and [communicate](#communicate) in parallel, using separate teams, if possible.**  The Incident Commander will coordinate these activities.  Notify the Incident Commander if there are steps the team should consider.
## Create Incident File
1. Create a new incident file at {{INCIDENT_FILE_LOCATION}} using the [incident name](#name-the-incident).  Use this file for secure storage of documentation, evidence, artifacts, _etc._
    * Provision secure digital storage.
    * Provision secure file exchange.
    * Obtain physical storage.
    * Share the incident file location on the call and chat.
    * `TODO: Customize and automate file location and procedure`
1. Document the functional and information impact, if known (see [Assess](#assess)). `TODO: Customize impact categories, if necessary.`
1. Document the vector, if known (_e.g.,_ web, email, removable media). `TODO: Customize vector list, if necessary.`
1. Document the incident summary: a brief overview of the vector, impact, investigation, and remediation situation, if known.
1. Document the incident timeline, including attacker activity and responder activity. `TODO: Add timelines of varying details, as necessary.`
1. Document investigation, remediation, and communication steps.  Document activities independently so they can be combined and reused, if possible.
1. Track significant information such as:
    * **Evidence**, with time of collection, source, chain of custody, _etc._
    * **Affected systems**, with how and when system was identified, and summary of effect (_e.g._, has malware, data accessed).
    * **Files of interest**, such as malware or data files, with system and metadata.
    * **Accessed and taken data**, with filenames, metadata, and time of suspected exposure.
    * **Significant attacker activity**, such as logins and malware execution, with time of the event.
    * **Network-based indicators of compromise (IOCs)**, such as IP addresses and domains.
    * **Host-based IOCs**, such as filenames, hashes, and registry keys.
    * **Compromised accounts**, with scope of access and time of compromise.
`TODO: Customize incident documentation procedure, including spreadsheets, databases, forms, systems, and templates, if necessary.`
## Collect Initial Leads
1. Interview incident reporter(s).
1. Collect initial supporting data (_e.g._, alarms, events, data, assumptions, intuitions) in the incident file.
1. Interview SME(s) with domain or system expertise, to understand technical detail, context, and risk.
1. Interview SME(s) in affected business unit, to understand mission/business impact, context, and risk.
1. Ensure leads are relevant, detailed, and actionable.
### Reference: Response Resource List
Resource                  | Location
------------------------- | ------------------------------------
Critical information list | {{CRITICAL_INFO_LIST_LOCATION}}
Critical asset list       | {{CRITICAL_ASSET_LIST_LOCATION}}

Log aggregator            | {{LOG_AGGREGATOR_CONSOLE}}
`TODO: Complete critical information and asset lists ("crown jewels"). This is incredibly important to effective response.`
`TODO: Customize response resource list`
## Update Investigative Plan and Incident File
1. Review and refine incident impact.
1. Review and refine incident vector.
1. Review and refine incident summary.
1. Review and refine incident timeline with facts and inferences.
1. Create hypotheses: what may have happened, and with what confidence.
1. **Identify and prioritize key questions** (information gaps) to support or discredit hypotheses.
    * Use the MITRE ATT&CK matrix or similar framework to [develop questions](#reference-attacker-tactics-to-key-questions-matrix).
        * [ATT&CK for Enterprise](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Main_Page), including links to Windows, Mac, and Linux specifics.
        * [ATT&CK Mobile Profile](https://attack.mitre.org/mobile/index.php/Main_Page) for mobile devices.
    * Use interrogative words as inspiration:
        * **When?**: first compromise, first data loss, access to x data, access to y system, _etc._
        * **What?**: impact, vector, root cause, motivation, tools/exploits used, accounts/systems compromised, data targeted/lost, infrastructure, IOCs, _etc._
        * **Where?**: attacker location, affected business units, infrastructure, _etc._
        * **How?**: compromise (exploit), persistence, access, exfiltration, lateral movement, _etc._
        * **Why?**: targeted, timing, access x data, access y system, _etc._
        * **Who?**: attacker, affected users, affected customers, _etc._
1. **Identify and prioritize witness devices and strategies** to answer key questions.
    * Consult network diagrams, asset management systems, and SME expertise
    * Check the [Response Resource List](#reference-response-resource-list))
1. Refer to [incident playbooks](#playbooks) for key questions, witness devices, and strategies for investigating common or highly damaging threats.
**The investigative plan is critical to an effective response; it drives all investigative actions.  Use critical thinking, creativity, and sound judgment.**
