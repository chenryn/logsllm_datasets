User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Ideal log rotation configuration for overloaded site I've been in charge of a server that has been stressed beyond its tipping point for some time. I've recommended changes that are currently in the process of being implemented by other members of the team that should alleviate the core infrastructure problems of the site. But, there is an acute problem that requires a stopgap measure to buy us some time. 

Apache restarts every morning at 7:30 due to the log rotation CRON running. 6:00 - 9:00 are our peak hours for normal site usage, and when combined with the CRON, the server runs out of memory. 

What log rotation configuration would help? Should I move it from daily to hourly? Change the thresholds? Just change the times (I did this and was still met with an outage).

Assistant: EEAA's advice to use a remote log server addresses the problem completely, but may not be possible in your environment.

Use LogRotate to reload Apache rather than restarting it, as described on this website. You'll probably want to change the parameters to daily. It shouldn't make any difference to outage time if you rotate hourly, daily, or weekly.

/var/log/apache2/*.log {
    weekly
    missingok
    rotate 52
    compress
    delaycompress
    notifempty
    create 640 root adm
    sharedscripts
    postrotate
        /etc/init.d/apache2 reload &gt; /dev/null
    endscript
    prerotate
        if [ -d /etc/logrotate.d/httpd-prerotate ]; then \
                run-parts /etc/logrotate.d/httpd-prerotate; \
        fi; \
    endscript
}


Reload should let Apache finish servicing any open requests before reloading the configuration. You may lose a few requests, but I wouldn't think you'd lose many. You may not lose any.

If you need higher reliability you should consider two load balanced servers with some kind of health check or live failover, or using a remote log server.
