1,324,134 nodes and had a degree distribution, diameter, and clus-
tering coefficient comparable to the Orkut dataset.
7.1 MCON construction
From the social network dataset, we constructed an MCON with
a node degree limit of 7.14 The bootstrap protocol randomly selects
2⌉) from the social network
an initial seed clique of four nodes (⌈ 7
and iteratively adds nodes to the seed based on social network re-
lationships. The final MCON contained just over 85% of the nodes
in the social network. Slightly more than 35% of MCON nodes
had under-full routing tables, resulting in average node degree of
5.997, with an average pairwise physical distance of 10.
7.2 Routing and search
Our DHT uses the Kad
routing protocol (a vari-
ation of Kademlia [30]),
using routing table of 16
buckets of 8 entries each.
The average number of
DHT hops between any
two MCON nodes is 2.5,
which translates to an av-
erage of 13 physical hops
in the efficient case, and
26 hops in the robust case.
(The probability distri-
bution of physical hops
per query with no churn is shown in Figure 4.) Note that due to the
greedy nature of routing table construction, which preferentially in-
corporates the nearest node with a given prefix match, the average
number of physical hops per logical hop is lower than the aver-
age number of physical hops between any two random nodes in the
MCON. Assuming average round trip times of 180ms (computed
from the “King” dataset [24]), a search should complete in fewer
than 2.5 seconds without time padding.
13Less than 12% of Orkut’s network at the time of collection
14We also simulated k = 5 and k = 9. The results conform to
expectations – smaller k reduces connectivity and efficiency.
Figure 4: Cumulative distribution of
physical hops per DHT query
Figure 5: Probability of query failure in MCON simulations. Churn
is the fraction of MCON members who are offline.
When a route fails, we select the next best route and continue try-
ing until we reach 25 failed routes per node or the query succeeds.
The rates of DHT query failure with churn for all three schemes are
shown in Figure 5. Data was collected using 500 independent tri-
als, routing between two randomly-selected nodes. In the efficient
scheme, the worst-case number of logical hops is 18 and the worst
case for physical hops is 178, which translates to a query time of
just under 33 seconds. In the worst case for the robust scheme, aver-
age performance is 127 logical hops and 395 physical hops, which
would require 71 seconds on average. (Note that many of these
physical hops are contacted in parallel, making the time estimate
strictly pessimistic.) The efficient scheme reached its performance
limit at 21% churn, and the robust scheme at 75% churn. Hybrid
scheme performance depends on the modulus.
Finally, the robust scheme may provide worse-than-expected re-
silience in certain topologies, such as when adversarial nodes form
clusters in the MCON due to dense social network relationships
among them. Clusters reduce the adversaries’ knowledge of hon-
est MCON nodes (since most of her neighbors are malicious), but
impede routing – adversarial clusters have a high chance of form-
ing neighborhoods with malicious majorities. However, assum-
ing route discovery proceeds correctly, we only require one honest
node per neighborhood for message forwarding to succeed.
8. CONCLUSION
In this paper we initiate a systematic study of membership con-
cealment as a security goal. While the idea has been implicitly de-
scribed in other work, it was not rigorously defined, and therefore
only implemented in an ad-hoc fashion, usually resulting in vul-
nerabilities. We presented attacks against two well-known censor-
ship resistance tools (Freenet and Tor bridges), and described three
designs for membership-concealing overlay networks (MCONs).
One design is efficient, one is more robust to churn, and one is a
hybrid, balancing robustness and efficiency. In simulation, churn
significantly degrades the performance of all schemes, but the ro-
bust scheme performs well under churn up to 75%. From a com-
bination of theoretical analysis and simulation, we conclude that
both schemes are practical, offering bounded-time search that lo-
cates both popular and rare files equally well. In the worst case,
our search time is less than 90 seconds in the robust scheme, and
less than 35 seconds in the efficient scheme.
Some open problems remain with our designs. First, our “infec-
tion” approach to constructing the MCON, while mitigating boot-
strap attacks, is nonetheless cumbersome. A better approach would
be to somehow allow people to ask for membership in the MCON
while preserving security. Second, the current route discovery mech-
anism requires a flood of the network at node join time. This
imposes significant message overhead, so we need a mechanism
that is more efficient and still maintains membership concealment
properties and sender-receiver unlinkability. Finally, although our
Membership and Invitation Authority can remain offline and hid-
den, it still represents a central point of failure15 – if it were com-
15with the exception of availability attacks
398promised then the complete membership of the network would be
discovered. In principle, the functions of the MIA can be carried
out using secure multi-party computation. We leave finding effi-
cient algorithms for this computation for future work.
