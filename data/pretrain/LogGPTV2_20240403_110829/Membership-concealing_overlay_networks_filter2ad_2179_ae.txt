### 1. Dataset Characteristics
The dataset consisted of 1,324,134 nodes and exhibited a degree distribution, diameter, and clustering coefficient comparable to the Orkut dataset.

### 2. MCON Construction
From the social network dataset, we constructed an MCON with a node degree limit of 7.14. The bootstrap protocol randomly selects an initial seed clique of four nodes (⌈7/2⌉) from the social network and iteratively adds nodes to the seed based on social network relationships. The final MCON contained just over 85% of the nodes in the social network. Slightly more than 35% of MCON nodes had under-full routing tables, resulting in an average node degree of 5.997, with an average pairwise physical distance of 10.

### 3. Routing and Search
Our DHT uses the Kad routing protocol, a variation of Kademlia [30], with a routing table consisting of 16 buckets, each containing 8 entries. The average number of DHT hops between any two MCON nodes is 2.5, which translates to an average of 13 physical hops in the efficient case and 26 hops in the robust case. (The probability distribution of physical hops per query with no churn is shown in Figure 4.) Due to the greedy nature of routing table construction, which preferentially incorporates the nearest node with a given prefix match, the average number of physical hops per logical hop is lower than the average number of physical hops between any two random nodes in the MCON. Assuming average round trip times of 180ms (computed from the “King” dataset [24]), a search should complete in fewer than 2.5 seconds without time padding.

**Note:**
- Less than 12% of Orkut’s network at the time of collection.
- We also simulated k = 5 and k = 9. The results conform to expectations—smaller k reduces connectivity and efficiency.

### 4. Performance Analysis
When a route fails, we select the next best route and continue trying until we reach 25 failed routes per node or the query succeeds. The rates of DHT query failure with churn for all three schemes are shown in Figure 5. Data was collected using 500 independent trials, routing between two randomly-selected nodes. In the efficient scheme, the worst-case number of logical hops is 18 and the worst case for physical hops is 178, which translates to a query time of just under 33 seconds. In the worst case for the robust scheme, average performance is 127 logical hops and 395 physical hops, which would require 71 seconds on average. (Note that many of these physical hops are contacted in parallel, making the time estimate strictly pessimistic.) The efficient scheme reached its performance limit at 21% churn, and the robust scheme at 75% churn. Hybrid scheme performance depends on the modulus.

**Robustness Considerations:**
The robust scheme may provide worse-than-expected resilience in certain topologies, such as when adversarial nodes form clusters in the MCON due to dense social network relationships among them. Clusters reduce the adversaries’ knowledge of honest MCON nodes (since most of their neighbors are malicious), but impede routing—adversarial clusters have a high chance of forming neighborhoods with malicious majorities. However, assuming route discovery proceeds correctly, we only require one honest node per neighborhood for message forwarding to succeed.

### 5. Conclusion
In this paper, we initiate a systematic study of membership concealment as a security goal. While the idea has been implicitly described in other work, it was not rigorously defined, and therefore only implemented in an ad-hoc fashion, usually resulting in vulnerabilities. We presented attacks against two well-known censorship resistance tools (Freenet and Tor bridges) and described three designs for membership-concealing overlay networks (MCONs). One design is efficient, one is more robust to churn, and one is a hybrid, balancing robustness and efficiency. In simulation, churn significantly degrades the performance of all schemes, but the robust scheme performs well under churn up to 75%. From a combination of theoretical analysis and simulation, we conclude that both schemes are practical, offering bounded-time search that locates both popular and rare files equally well. In the worst case, our search time is less than 90 seconds in the robust scheme and less than 35 seconds in the efficient scheme.

**Open Problems:**
- Our "infection" approach to constructing the MCON, while mitigating bootstrap attacks, is nonetheless cumbersome. A better approach would be to allow people to request membership in the MCON while preserving security.
- The current route discovery mechanism requires a flood of the network at node join time, imposing significant message overhead. We need a more efficient mechanism that still maintains membership concealment properties and sender-receiver unlinkability.
- Although our Membership and Invitation Authority (MIA) can remain offline and hidden, it still represents a central point of failure. If compromised, the complete membership of the network would be discovered. In principle, the functions of the MIA can be carried out using secure multi-party computation. We leave finding efficient algorithms for this computation for future work.
