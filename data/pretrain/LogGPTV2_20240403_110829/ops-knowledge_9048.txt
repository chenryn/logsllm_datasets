User: How to use Git to manage code version? Please describe in detail how to create branches, merge branches and other basic operations.
Assistant: Git is a version control tool that helps developers manage code versions. To use Git to manage code versions, you need to master the following basic operations: 1. Create a branch: a branch refers to a version separated from the main code. To create a branch in Git, you can use the "git branch" command. For example, to create a branch named "feature-branch", you can run the following command: git branch feature-branch 2. Switch branch: Switch branch allows developers to modify and test the code without affecting the main code . To switch branches in Git, you can use the "git checkout" command. For example, to switch to the branch named "feature-branch", you can run the following command: git checkout feature-branch 3. Commit the code: In Git, committing the code means saving the code changes to the repository. Committing code can use the "git add" and "git commit" commands. For example, to commit the file "example.py", you can run the following command: git add example.py git commit -m "Add example.py file" 4. Merge branch: When the developer finishes working on the branch and wants to merge the changes When merging back into the mainline code, you can use the "git merge" command. For example, to merge the branch named "feature-branch" into the current branch, you can run the following command: git merge feature-branch 5. Resolve conflicts: Merge conflicts occur when Git cannot automatically merge code. The best way to resolve conflicts is to manually merge the code. After manually resolving conflicts, run the following command to commit the modified code to the repository: git add . git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts" The above are basic branch management operations in Git. It should be noted that when using Git to manage the code version, the modified code should be submitted to the repository regularly, and the branch should be merged in time. This helps keep your code stable and traceable.
