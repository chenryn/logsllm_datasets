User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题.htaccess Authentication Internal Server Error 500 I am trying to setup an authentication for a directory on a ubuntu server and when i sign in i get a 500 Internal Server Error

I have the following:

 AuthUserFile .htpasswd
 AuthName "Sign In"
 AuthType Basic
 Require eMA


I also tried the POST GET and valid-user

the htpaswd file is in the same directory as the htaccess.

I cant seem to figure out what would be causing this any ideas?

Assistant: I assume you use apache webserver. Most probably you will find the cause of the error in the error_log file which can be found in /var/log/apache2 according to http://wiki.apache.org/httpd/DistrosDefaultLayout.
