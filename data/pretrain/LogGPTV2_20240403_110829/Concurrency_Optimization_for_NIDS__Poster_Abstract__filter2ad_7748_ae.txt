The burden of life-style related diseases has been increasing since the 70’s Disease prevention through improvement of human health is attracting 
more and more attention The microbiome is an important new target in these approaches Our microbiome affects the metabolism of nutrients and 
thereby influences host physiology Currently there is a general lack of understanding about the importance of the role of the gut microbiome in health 
and well-being Within the MyNewGut project research is performed on the gut microbiome and its relation to dietary interventions By integration of the 
data of separate MyNewGut studies we are expanding the understanding for diet-microbiome-host interaction Clinical, NMR and microbiome data of 
5 different dietary intervention studies were integrated First all measured parameters (clinical, LC-MS, NMR and microbiome) were aligned to discover 
overlap between studies Next, overlapping parameters were selected for further integration A workflow was developed to align and integrate NMR data 
the data of the different studies Also for the microbiome data of all studies a workflow was designed We show that metabolism is improved by butyrate/
FT and fibre/PUFA, but becomes more unhealthy after a high protein interventionTraditionally microbiome, LC-MS and NMR data is evaluated separately 
Integration of all these datasets from the different studies into a model which visualizes treatment effects is useful for detection of new diet-microbiome-
host interactions

Quantitative Dietary Fingerprinting (QDF)—A Novel Tool for Comprehensive Dietary Assessment Based on 
Urinary Nutrimetabolomics

Accurate dietary assessment is a great challenge in nutritional research, needing powerful and robust tools for the reliable measurement of food intake 
and monitoring dietary habits To address this issue, we optimized a novel Quantitative Dietary Fingerprinting (QDF) approach, based on the combination 
of solid phase extraction and subsequent analysis by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (1) This 
method was validated for the quantitation of about 350 biomarkers, including (poly)phenolic aglycones, phase II metabolites and microbial-transformed 
compounds, as well as other dietary components The simultaneous extraction of the complex urinary food metabolome was accomplished by using Oasis 
HLB solid-phase extraction plates To improve the recovery of sulfate conjugates, ammonium formate was added to elution solvents as modifier Then, 
chromatographic separation was achieved by reversed-phase UHPLC in very short run times, which facilitates the method application to large sample 
sizes Tandem mass spectrometry, by using the multiple reaction monitoring acquisition mode, enabled the selective and sensitive detection of these 
350 dietary markers at concentrations usually found in real urine samples The applicability of this QDF method was assessed by analyzing urine samples 
collected after acute dietary interventions with various foods, including orange, apple, grapefruit, red wine, beer, coffee, green tea, soy, walnuts and 
wholegrain bread Therefore, it could be concluded that the optimized methodology presents a huge potential for the assessment of dietary patterns by 
means of high-throughput analysis of the urinary metabolomic pattern

Grass, beef and human. Unlocking the value of the food chain in New Zealand
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Arvind Subbaraj, AgResearch Ltd., New Zealand
We recently published the ryegrass metabolome and a chemotaxonomic classification of 715 ryegrass genotypes, representing 118 populations from 21 
different countries Ryegrass is integral to temperate pastoral agriculture which contributes to most of the meat and milk production worldwide Pasture-
fed beef is claimed to have several health benefits compared to its grain-fed counterparts Lipids are central to this debate, and phospholipids are 
predominantly implicated in the health benefits of meat consumption We therefore conducted a non-targeted lipidomics analysis of 38 different cuts of 
pasture-fed Wagyu to account for differences in the lipid profile across the beef carcass Ten cuts with high phospholipid content were identified, and breed 
(Wagyu vs Angus) and feed (Pasture vs Grain) effects were evaluated in a separate study Significant differences in phospholipid content was not observed 
between pasture-fed Wagyu and Angus However, phospholipids were in higher concentrations in pasture-fed compared to grain-fed Wagyu beef 
Finally, we aim to track the effect of consumption of pasture-fed Wagyu beef, grain-fed beef, and a vegetable-based meat alternative, on circulating lipids 
and biomarkers of cardiovascular disease risk in humans An eight-week dietary intervention study is currently underway, and a non-targeted lipidomics 
analysis of blood plasma will be conducted This talk will summarise recent metabolomics studies conducted in New Zealand to elucidate and decipher 
the critical components of the food chain from grass and animal, through to human consumption Missing links in our understanding eg the rumen 
metabolome, a key component of the grass to animal continuum, will be discussed

NMR metabolomics revealed different impact of non-acylated and acylated anthocyanins on plasma metabolic 
profiles in obese diabetic Zucker rats

Anthocyanins are present in food as non-acylated (NAAs) and/or acylated (AAs) and known to possess potent anti-diabetic properties AAs have been 
reported to have higher stability, antioxidant activity, and bioavailability compared to NAAs Currently, no research has been reported comparing the 
effects of these two forms of anthocyanins on metabolic profile of diabetic models Here, we aimed to compare the modulatory effects of NAAs (from 
bilberry) and AAs (from purple potato)  on metabolic changes in obese Zucker diabetic rat (fa/fa) Experimental rats were fed with NAAs and AAs at two 
doses for 8 weeks 1H NMR metabolomics was used to reveal changes in plasma metabolites NAAs supplementation reduced the plasma glucose level, 
but similar effect was not seen in the group fed with AAs All treatment groups decreased levels of branch chain amino acids (BCAAs) and improved lipid 
profiles, although no significance was found in the group fed with NAAs at the low dose AAs fed groups showed improved secretion and sensitivity of 
insulin, as indicated by the positive change in glutamine/glutamate ratio In AAs fed groups, decreased levels of lactate, serine, threonine, and glycine might 
be associated with improved oxidative status and shift in energy production from glycolysis and TCA cycle towards lipid catabolism Our data demonstrate 
that NAAs improved glucose level through modulating insulin resistance and lipid profiles AAs reversed most of the changed levels of metabolites in type 
2 diabetes to the normal state by modifying insulin resistance and secretion, oxidative stress, energy production, and lipid profiles

Tumors harbor combinations of heterogeneous neoplastic cells In this complex ecosystem, all modalities of mutual cell interactions can take place 
within the context of environmental cues that exert selective pressures In spite of the underlying heterogeneity, two broad operational categories of 
neoplastic cells, namely cancer stem cell (CSC) and non-CSC, are most relevant with regards to two key properties of evolving tumor cells: survival to 
stress and metastatic colonization Using a dual model of two clonal subpopulations isolated from an established prostate cancer cell line (PC-3), we have 
applied a systems biology approach including experimental data integration into genome-scale metabolic models to unveil metabolic differences and 
potential vulnerabilities to be exploited as putative drug targets The dual model consists of a CSC-subpopulation (PC-3M-high metastatic potential and 
low invasiveness) and a non-CSC-subpopulation (PC-3S-expressing EMT markers with high invasiveness and low metastatic potential) Results show 
that EMT and metastasis programes display different metabolic traits The main differences observed have been at the level of differential use of glucose 
and glutamine to fuel TCA cycle, mitochondrial respiration, one-carbon metabolism, beta-oxidation and eicosanoids metabolism We applied the same 
approach to identify the metabolic reprogramming associated to platinum resistance and we have also identified metabolic alterations emerging from 
platinum resistance to be used in combined drug therapies Acknowledgments: MINECO-European Commission FEDER funds– “Una manera de hacer

Using stable-isotope labelled metabolomics to explore cell-cell communication between malaria parasites  
and host cells
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Darren Creek, Monash University, Australia
CO-AUTHORS: Anna Sexton, Christian Doerig, Teresa Carvalho
Malaria is caused by infection of host red blood cells (RBCs) with the Plasmodium parasite and leads to a range of clinical presentations including fever, 
anaemia and metabolic acidosis Characterising the interplay between host and parasite factors is critical for understanding the molecular basis of these 
clinical symptoms RBCs are essential for the lifecycle of P falciparum; however, biochemical changes in uninfected, bystander RBCs have not been 
studied in detail We performed an untargeted metabolomics study to investigate metabolic changes in uninfected RBCs when exposed to media from 
P falciparum culture (“conditioned RBCs”) We observed significant perturbations to central carbon metabolism in conditioned RBCs Stable isotope 
labelled U-13C-glucose was used as a carbon source to differentiate active RBC metabolism from parasite-derived metabolites, and this showed that flux 
through glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway was significantly perturbed in conditioned RBCs Notably, the level of U-13C-lactate secreted by 
conditioned RBCs was higher than control cells, indicating increased glycolytic flux To identify factors driving this effect, P falciparum culture medium was 
filtered (to remove protein and extracellular vesicles) and incubated with RBCs Metabolomic analysis showed that the remaining parasite small molecules, 
alone, were capable of inducing metabolic perturbations in RBCs Metabolomic profiling of media from P falciparum cultures has provided a candidate list 
of small molecules that may be responsible Altogether these data demonstrate the modulation of RBC metabolism by P falciparum, which may contribute 
to the metabolic symptoms of clinical infection

Using deuterium labelled glucose to quantify redox metabolism in plants
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Edward Smith, University of Oxford, United Kingdom
CO-AUTHORS: James S O McCullagh, R George Ratcliffe, Nicholas J Kruger
A complete picture of plant metabolism is essential for understanding plant productivity and successful metabolic engineering However, a lack of 
quantitative information about sources of metabolic reductant limits the ability to engineer plants to exploit desirable traits NADPH is the primary source 
of cellular reductant, required for biosynthesis and protection against oxidative stress Whilst the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway represents the 
most direct route for NADPH production from sugars, there is increasing evidence that other pathways make significant contributions to redox balance 
Deuterium based isotopic tracers have recently been developed to quantify the production of NADPH from different pathways in mammalian cells, but the 
application of these tracers to plants has not previously been explored In this study LC-MS was used to measure deuterium incorporation into metabolites 
extracted from heterotrophic Arabidopsis cell cultures grown on [1-²H]glucose or ²H₂O The results highlight features of plant metabolism that can confound 
analysis, such as the interconnectivity of the plant metabolic network, the duplication of pathways in subcellular compartments and the high abundance of 
enzymes that can catalyse the loss of isotopic label to solvent Understanding these features is a prerequisite for developing more effective strategies for 
flux determination in plant metabolism and ensuring data are both quantitative and representative of biological processes in vivo

Modelling Cancer Lipogenesis using REIMS Metabolic Flux analysis in breast cancer cell lines
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Seyma Turkseven, Imperial College London, United Kingdom
CO-AUTHORS: Alvaro Perdones-Montero, Simon Cameron, Nikolaos Koundouros, George Poulogiannis, Zoltan Takats
Rapid evaporative ionisation mass spectrometry (REIMS) offers a novel opportunity for understanding the alterations in lipid metabolism that plays an 
important role during cancer progression REIMS is an ambient technique which allows sample analysis without preparative steps which hold the potential 
to alter the chemical composition of a sample Here, REIMS was utilised to monitor metabolic flux during cell proliferation using U-13C-labelled palmitic 
acid to provide a tracer for lipogenesis in in vitro studies For labelling experiments, SKBR3, MCF7 and MCF10A cells were seeded into culture dishes 
using DMEM and DMEM/F12 and were then changed to a fatty acid free-BSA media overnight Following this, cells were treated with [U-13C]-palmitic 
acid under normoxic conditions for 6h, detached using a cell scraper, and then analysed using REIMS utilising a CO2 laser for sample heating The ratio 
of the labelled palmitate taken up by cells to the production of unlabelled palmitate through de novo lipogenesis showed a similarity in cancer cells and 
nontumorigenic cells However, palmitic acid incorporation into complex lipids resulted in specific lipidomic profiles for the different breast cancer cell lines 
The detected labelled phospholipids after the supplementation cells with the nutrient might help to further interpretation of the lipid signalling process as 
the cancer cell lines were related to PI3K/Akt/mTOR mediated regulation of the cell functions This study demonstrates the applicability of LA-REIMS for the 
characterization of metabolic flux experiments using labelled metabolites in human cell lines – with wider applications to metabolic flux analysis

Exploring the use of GC-CI-MS for stable isotope labeling in metabolomics
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Jordi Capellades Tomàs, IISPV, Spain
CO-AUTHORS: Alexandra Junza, Oscar Yanes
Isotopic labeling experiments have been incredibly valuable to monitor metabolic reactions in biological systems, which is crucial to understand 
homeostasis alterations that occur in disease Experimental determination of metabolic fluxes can be inferred from a characteristic rearrangement of stable 
isotope tracers (eg, 13C or 15N) that can be detected by mass spectrometry Metabolites measured are generally members of well-known metabolic 
pathways, and most of them can be detected by both gas chromatography (GC) coupled to electron ionization (EI) MS and liquid chromatography (LC) 
coupled to electrospray (ESI) MS approaches In here, we show that GC methods coupled to chemical ionization (CI) MS have a clear advantage over 
alternative methodologies due to GC’s superior chromatography separation efficiency and the fact that CI is a soft ionization technique that yields 
identifiable protonated molecular ion peaks We tested diverse GC-CI-MS setups, including methane and isobutane reagent gases, triple quadrupole (QqQ) 
MS in SIM mode or monitoring selected ion clusters using optimized narrow-windows (~10 Da) in scan mode, and standard full scan methods using high 
resolution GC-TOF and GC-Orbitrap systems The GC-Orbitrap MS in full scan showed the best performance, enabling precise detection of isotopologues 
in most metabolic intermediates of central carbon metabolism Finally, with the aim of overcoming manual operations, we developed an R-based tool called 
IsoScan that automatically quantifies all isotopologues of intermediate metabolites of glycolysis, TCA cycle, amino acids, pentose phosphate pathway and 
urea cycle

PRESENTING AUTHOR: Karsten Suhre, Weill Cornell Medicine - Qatar, Qatar
Deep molecular phenotyping of population-based studies allows to investigate disease relevant biological pathway by studying their natural variation 
in large numbers of individuals Genome-wide association studies with metabolic endpoints already revealed hundreds of genetically influenced 
metabotypes that define human metabolic individuality Recently, these large scale omics studies have been extended by including proteomics and other 
omics phenotypes, and also by linking these multiomics readouts to epigenetic regulation In this keynote I will review recent developments in the field and 
discuss potential applications for health and drug research from a precision medicine’s perspective

Numerous common genetic variants have been identified for association with the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) using genome-wide association 
studies (GWAS) For the vast majority, the molecular mechanisms leading to the disease phenotype are not well understood or are completely unknown 
We conducted untargeted and targeted 1H NMR metabolomics to characterize the metabolomic signatures associated with the risk variants to generate 
new knowledge about possible mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of CAD Both CPMG and conventional 1D 1H NMR spectra acquired from serum 
of participants in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA, N=~4,000), the Rotterdam Study (RS, N=~2,000), and the Airwave Health Monitoring 
Study (Airwave, N=3,000) were used in the untargeted metabolomics analysis For targeted analysis, we used Bruker Lipoprotein Subclass Analysis (BI-
LISA) in MESA and Airwave cohorts The current analyses included 7,141 individuals for CPMG, 7,149 for 1D NMR and 5,794 for BI-LISA data We found that 
variants in 37 loci out of 365 reported loci for CAD were associated with metabolites at the 1% metabolome-wide significance level These metabolites 
mainly originated from lipoprotein subclasses, lipids from several lipoprotein particles, and several amino acids potentially involved in protein synthesis 
This information could produce new knowledge on the causal pathways linking genes to cardiovascular diseases and identify novel preventive targets

With a global rise in ageing population and age-associated diseases, understanding how diet modifies cognitive ageing represents key revenues 
for prevention In this discovery (D-CogPlast#) study, we aimed to identify a combination of diet-derived metabolites associated with accelerated 
cognitive decline using untargeted metabolomics We leveraged the French Three-City cohort of elderly people and using an exploratory approach, 
designed a nested case-control study contrasting the metabolic profiles of 209 cases of cognitive decline over 13 years against 209 controls (matched 
for age, gender and educational level) over 12 years following baseline blood draw Serum samples were profiled using high-resolution UHPLC-QToF 
Validated PLS-DA of the baseline serum profiles clearly distinguished between case and control populations A signature of 22 serum metabolites were 
associated with cognitive decline, using bootstrap-enhanced least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression Seven metabolites 
derived from the food metabolome included coffee-derived metabolites (atractyligenin glucuronide, cyclo(leucyl-prolyl) and caffeine), a biomarker 
of citrus intake (proline betaine), 3-carboxy-4-methyl-5-pentyl-2-furanpropionic acid (CMPFP), a cocoa-derived metabolite (cyclo(prolyl-valyl)) and 
an unknown compound putatively linked to wine intake The other endogenous metabolites included three acylcarnitines, glycodeoxycholic acid, a 
glycerophospholipid, trimethyllysine, glucose, cortisol, creatinine and arginine The 22 metabolite-signature increased the predictive performance of 
cognitive decline from a cross-validated Area Under the Receiver Operating Curve of 62% (95% CI 56-67%) to 75% (95% CI 70-80%) Our untargeted 
metabolomics study supports a role for the food metabolome (eg, metabolites from coffee, citrus fruits, cocoa and wine) and various alterations in 
endogenous metabolism in cognitive aging

Prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and the second cause of cancer-related death in men Identifying modifiable risk factors and 
markers for disease risk are therefore important Our aim was to identify metabolites associated with risk of prostate cancer using a nested case-control
