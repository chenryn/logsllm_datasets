Hi,
I'm editing some files which include Myanmar text. This includes diacritic
characters (meaning char + char adding a diacritic (above / below / left /
right) the previous char). Atom appears to give each char equal space, meaning
that I need to click right of the text to select it, and the highlight appears
offset right, too. Each string makes it more difficult to highlight text
appearing after it on the line.

Put the text နေပြည်တော် in the middle of a long line to see what this looks
like. This problem will occur with many other scripts, for example Devanagari
used widely in India and Nepal - use this text: देवनागरी. Can you use HTML5
Canvas measureText() ?
