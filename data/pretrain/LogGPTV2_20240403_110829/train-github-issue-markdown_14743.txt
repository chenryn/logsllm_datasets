I believe there is an issue with line 567 in the `tools/rplot.py` file. The current code is:

```python
ax.contour(Z, extent=[x_min, x_max, y_min, y_max])
```

To correct the 90-degree rotation observed when plotting a density map, the code should be modified to:

```python
ax.contour(Z.T, extent=[x_min, x_max, y_min, y_max])
```

This change transposes the `Z` array, which should resolve the orientation problem.
