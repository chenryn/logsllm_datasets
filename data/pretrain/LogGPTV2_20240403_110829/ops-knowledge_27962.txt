User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题creating a journal/blog im trying to replace our current journal (excel sheet) with a web portal based journal. something kind of like twitter, but with more options. also needs to have a login so we can track the people entering. it can also be some sort of tool but i cant find anything that meets our demands... i could use a ITIL ticket service but that has way to much functionalities for our use. 

im basicly looking for a webportal with a shared blog, where users can login and creat new entries with:


a topic name
a automated follow-up ID number
a field where they can enter specific info
a reply field
and a status field with pre defined statuses


can anyone help me with this?

Assistant: Check out ididwork.com I like it, for a worklog. It describes itself as a cross between a work log and twitter. It allows for tags and weekly stats generated on stats and time per tag.  It allows you to share your work with co-workers.
