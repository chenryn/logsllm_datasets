Hi. Today, I tried to work on making test codes for my plugin and I can't make
the call to plugin methods in test code. Is there any guideline make test code
for plugins?
    import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
    import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';
    import 'package:flutter_sound/flutter_sound.dart';
    import 'package:flutter_sound_example/main.dart';
    void main() {
      test('startRecorder', () async {
        FlutterSound flutterSound = new FlutterSound();
        String path = await flutterSound.startRecorder(null);
        print('path: $path');
      });
    }
Error code below.
    Exception: MissingPluginException(No implementation found for method startRecorder on channel flutter_sound)
      package:flutter_sound/flutter_sound.dart 100:7  FlutterSound.startRecorder
