ABSTRACT
A time stamp based on the power network signature called
the Electrical Network Frequency (ENF) has been used by
an emerging class of approaches for authenticating digital
audio and video recordings in computer-to-computer com-
munications. However, the presence of adversaries may ren-
der the time stamp insecure, and it is crucial to understand
the robustness of ENF analysis against anti-forensic opera-
tions. This paper investigates possible anti-forensic opera-
tions that can remove and alter the ENF signal while trying
to preserve the host signal, and develops detection methods
targeting these operations. Improvements over anti-forensic
operations that can circumvent the detection are also exam-
ined, for which various trade-oﬀs are discussed. To develop
an understanding of the dynamics between a forensic an-
alyst and an adversary, an evolutionary perspective and a
game-theoretical perspective are proposed, which allow for
a comprehensive characterization of plausible anti-forensic
strategies and countermeasures. Such an understanding has
the potential to lead to more secure and reliable time stamp
schemes based on ENF analysis.

ious digital recording devices. Once a media document con-
taining important information is created, it can be easily dis-
tributed through network and make rapid and broad social
impacts through social media infrastructure. Due to their
digital nature, these media data can be vulnerable to digital
forgeries. Typical examples include digital editing software
to cut a clip from one audio/video ﬁle and insert into an-
other, or modifying the creation date/time in the metadata
ﬁeld. Given the feasibility of digital forgeries, secure use
of media data requires forensic authentication mechanisms
that can identify data origin and detect content forgery.
One emerging direction of digital recording authentication
is to exploit an potential time stamp originated from the
power networks. This time stamp, referred to as the Elec-
trical Network Frequency (ENF), is based on the ﬂuctuation
of the supply frequency of a power grid. The nominal value
of the ENF is 60Hz in the Americas, Taiwan, Saudi Arabia
and Philippines, and is 50Hz in other regions except Japan,
which adopts both frequencies. It has been found that dig-
ital devices such as audio recorders, CCTV recorders, and
camcorders that are plugged into the power systems or are
near power sources may pick up the ENF signal due to the
interference from electromagnetic ﬁelds created by power
sources [4]. An important property about the ENF signal is
that its frequency is ﬂuctuating around the nominal value
because of varying loads on the power grid. For example, in
the United States, the ENF usually varies between 59.9Hz
and 60.1Hz.
It has also been shown that the ﬂuctuations
measured at the same time but at two diﬀerent locations
under the same power grid follow basically the same trend
[4].
The ﬂuctuation of the ENF has been successfully exploited
to authenticate digital recordings [4, 10, 9, 3]. In [4, 10], it
is demonstrated that the ENF signal is captured in audio
recordings and exhibits a high correlation with the ENF sig-
nal measured from the power mains supply at the same time.
As such, the ENF signal can be used to indicate the record-
ing time of an audio recording provided that a database of
ground-truth ENF signals from the power grid is accessible.
An alternative technique in [9] detects the phase discontinu-
ity of the ENF signal, the presence of which suggests where
tampering has taken place. Most recently, the work in [3]
validated for the ﬁrst time the presence of the ENF signal
in visual recordings. Optical sensors and video cameras are
used to demonstrate that the ENF signal can be captured
from ﬂuorescent lighting and further picked up by video cam-
eras in an indoor environment. This ﬁnding suggests that
the same ENF-based time stamp available in audio record-

ings can be used to authenticate visual data as well. Fur-
thermore, forensic binding can be achieved for visual and
audio tracks to verify their temporal synchronization.
The promising potential of ENF analysis in forensic in-
vestigations is based on the premise that the ENF signal is
present in an audio or video signal in an unaltered manner.
This premise ensures that once the ENF signal is success-
fully extracted, it can be used as a truth-telling evidence
to verify time, location, and integrity. However, similar to
many other security and forensics tasks, there exist adver-
saries who have the incentives to perform anti-forensic op-
erations to counteract forensic investigations [6, 2]. In order
to establish ENF-based analysis as a credible technique, it is
of paramount importance to understand its security against
anti-forensic operations, namely, whether the ENF signal
can be compromised, and to what extent. Further, forensic
analysts should understand and address identiﬁed vulnera-
bilities in ENF analysis, and take into consideration possible
improvements that an adversary may make. To the best of
our knowledge, the current paper is the ﬁrst work that con-
siders these issues. We apply signal processing techniques
to design anti-forensic operations, and then develop detec-
tion methods targeting these operations. In response to the
detection methods, improvements over the anti-forensic op-
erations are also investigated in this paper, for which various
trade-oﬀs are discussed. More fundamentally, we develop a
comprehensive understanding of the interplay between the
forensic analyst and the adversary, from both an evolution-
ary perspective and a game-theoretic perspective. We be-
lieve that such an understanding can be used to character-
ize a wide range of actions that may take place, and will
contribute to more secure and reliable time stamp schemes
based on ENF analysis.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2
reviews the mechanism of ENF signal extraction and match-
ing. Section 3 investigates ways to remove and embed ENF
signals present in a host signal. Section 4 presents the con-
ditions for anti-forensics detection, which motivate a few
concrete methods for anti-forensics detection. In response
to the detection, Section 5 studies improvements over the
anti-forensic operations, for which various trade-oﬀs are dis-
cussed. In view of the dynamic nature of the anti-forensics
and the countermeasures, Section 6 provides an evolutionary
perspective and a game-theoretic perspective to encompass
a wide range of actions and interactions available to a foren-
sic analyst and an adversary. Finally, Section 7 concludes
this paper.
2. ENF SIGNAL EXTRACTION AND
MATCHING
In this section, we brieﬂy describe our procedure for ex-
tracting the ENF ﬂuctuations from a given signal. Two
types of signals are considered in this paper for ENF signal
extraction and matching. The ﬁrst is the audio signal that
contains speech recordings mixed with music and sporadic
sound activities. All audio signals used in this paper have
been sampled at 8000Hz with 16-bit quantization precision
and a length of 10 minutes. The 10-minute duration ensures
that the audio signal as well as the ENF ﬂuctuations are
suﬃciently long for reliable matching based on the state of
the art. Any anti-forensic operations to be investigated in
this paper are also assumed to be performed on such audio
signals. The second type of signal is the power mains signal
that is recorded directly from a power source using a voltage
divider device, which is used as ground truth for matching.
Our ENF signal extraction basically follows the proce-
dure described in [3]. The recorded signal (either an audio
or power mains signal) is ﬁrst down-sampled to 500Hz to re-
duce the computational complexity. A ﬁltering process can
then be carried out to only retain the signal component that
carries the ENF. The dominant instantaneous frequency in
the recorded signal is then estimated to measure the ﬂuctu-
ations in ENF as a function of time, for which we use spec-
trogram based weighted energy method as in [3]. To obtain
the spectrogram of the ENF signal, we divide the signal into
overlapping frames of 16 seconds each with an overlap factor
of 50%. A high resolution Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of
8192 points is carried out for each frame. After obtaining the
spectrogram, we calculate the weighted average frequency
in each time bin of the spectrogram by weighing frequency
bins around the nominal values of the ENF with the energy
present in the corresponding frequency. From the estimated
frequency ﬂuctuations in ENF signals from the audio and
power mains recordings, we calculate their normalized cor-
relation for diﬀerent values of frame lag. The range of the
normalized correlation value is between −1 and +1. As an
example, Fig. 1(a) and 1(b) show the spectrograms around

normalized correlation values as a function the frame lag is

ﬂuctuations, which is conﬁrmed by the peak normalized cor-
relation value of 0.86 in Fig. 1(c) when the two recordings
are synchronized.
3. ANTI-FORENSIC OPERATIONS
AGAINST ENF ANALYSIS
In this section, we investigate anti-forensic operations that
can counteract ENF analysis. The general purpose of anti-
forensic operations is to alter a host signal so that the traces
left in the host signal that pertain to speciﬁc forensic inves-
tigations are removed or changed. Although plausible anti-
forensic operations and countermeasures are domain-speciﬁc
and may seem ad-hoc at times, exploring these operations
and countermeasures is necessary for identifying the avail-
able operations of both the forensic analyst and the adver-
sary, leading to a comprehensive understanding of the overall
strategy space.
In many anti-forensic tasks against information protec-
tion, the adversary has to preserve the quality of the host
signal, otherwise the quality degradation in itself will in-
dicate the use of anti-forensics and the host signal will be
rejected to be forensic evidence. In our problem, the ENF
signal is restricted around narrow neighborhoods of known
frequency locations. As such, the ENF signal is less likely
to be tightly coupled with the main body of the host signal,
making it possible to manipulate the ENF signal while try-
ing to preserve the perceptual quality of the host signal. In
this section, we explore two diﬀerent levels of anti-forensics,
starting with the removal of the ENF signal and further con-
sidering the embedding of an alien ENF signal.
3.1 ENF Signal Removal by a Bandstop Filter
The ﬁrst anti-forensic operation that we consider is to re-
move the ENF signal present in a host signal. Since the
ENF signal in nature is restricted in a small frequency re-
gion (a.k.a. narrowband hereafter), it is reasonable for an
adversary to apply a bandstop ﬁlter to remove the ENF
signal. Bandstop ﬁltering (a.k.a. notch ﬁltering) is a well-
studied subject in digital signal processing [8]. A number
of design methodologies, such as equiripple ﬁlter or Kaiser
window ﬁlter design, have been proposed and implemented
in popular software packages such as MATLAB. To perform
bandstop ﬁltering, an adversary selects two main parame-
ters, the stopband bandwidth and the transition bandwidth.
The stopband bandwidth controls the frequency range in
which the signal is attenuated to the minimum magnitude
level. For the task of ENF signal removal, the choice of
stopband bandwidth depends on the actual range of ENF
variation, and the ENF signal of wider variations may be
removed using wider stopbands. The second parameter, the
transition bandwidth, is the range in which the signal at-
tenuation varies from maximum to minimum.
It has an
impact on the ﬁlter length and computational complexity;
a sharper bandwidth implies a longer ﬁlter and more time
required to compute the ﬁlter output. Since accurate ENF
matching requires ENF signals of suﬃciently long durations,
it is reasonable to assume that audio signals used for anti-
forensic operations are also suﬃciently long. Therefore, if
the adversary can aﬀord the computational cost, he/she has
enough signal samples to carry out a bandstop ﬁltering with
