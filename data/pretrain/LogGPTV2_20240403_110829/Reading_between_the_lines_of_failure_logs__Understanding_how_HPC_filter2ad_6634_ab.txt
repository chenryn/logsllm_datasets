### Correlations Between Failures in the Same Rack

When examining pairwise correlations, i.e., the probability of a failure of type Y within a week of a failure of type X, we find that a failure of a particular type always increases the probability of the same type of failure within the following week. This increase is significantly higher than the increase for the same type of failure following a random failure (i.e., not necessarily the same type). Figure 2 (right) summarizes our findings. We observe an increase in failure probability as high as 170X for environmental failures and nearly 10X for software failures. All these increases are statistically significant based on the two-sample hypothesis test.

Specifically, for hardware failures, which are the most common type, both memory and CPU failures show a significant increase in probability in the day or week following another failure of the same type. This observation suggests potential hypotheses for the causes of such errors. One possible explanation is that nodes in the same rack share similar environmental factors, such as power quality. The strong effect of environmental failures on the frequency of follow-up failures motivates a more detailed study of environmental failures in Section VII.

### Correlations Between Failures in the Same System

In this section, we investigate whether and how failures between different nodes in the same system (not necessarily in the same rack) are correlated. Our findings indicate that the weekly probability of a node experiencing a failure does increase after another node in the same system has a failure. However, this increase is significantly smaller compared to nodes in the same rack: in group-1 systems, the weekly probability of a node experiencing a failure increases from 2.04% to 2.68%, and for group-2 systems, it increases from 22.5% to 35.3%. Based on the two-sample hypothesis test, these increases are not significant enough to reject the hypothesis that a node failure does not increase the likelihood of follow-up failures in nodes within the same system.

Breaking down the results by failure type provides more insight. Figure 3 shows the probability that a node in a system will fail within a week following a failure of type X (where X can be: environment, hardware, human errors, network, software, memory, CPU failures, or undetermined). In group-1 systems, software, hardware, and human failures in a node increase the probability that other nodes in the system will also experience failures. The increase following software failures (a factor of 1.27X) is statistically significant. For group-2 systems, all types of failures show an increase in Figure 3, with the largest increase, a factor of 3.69X, observed following a network failure. The two-sample hypothesis test confirms that all failure types, except hardware and human, significantly increase the chance of follow-up failures in other nodes.

### Do Some Nodes in a System Fail Differently from Others?

#### Do Some Nodes Fail More Frequently Than Others?

Figure 4 illustrates the total number of failures for each node in systems 18, 19, and 20 (the three largest systems in terms of the number of nodes: 1024, 1024, and 512 nodes, respectively). The graphs show that in all systems, a single node (node with ID 0) had significantly more failures than the rest of the nodes. For example, in system 20, node 0 reported 19 times more failures than the average node, and in system 19, node 0 reported more than 30 times higher failure rates than the average node. To test the significance of differences in failure rates, we performed chi-square tests for differences between proportions. With 99% confidence level, we rejected the null hypothesis that all nodes in each system had equal failure rates (p-value < 2.2e-16). Interestingly, even after removing node 0, we can still reject the hypothesis that all nodes in each system had equal failure rates.

#### Are the Failure Characteristics of Failure-Prone Nodes Different from Other Nodes?

To determine whether the increased number of failures in some nodes is due to an increased number of failures of a particular type or generally higher failure rates, we compare the relative breakdown of different failure types for failure-prone nodes against the rest of the system in Figure 5. Additionally, Figure 6 compares the probabilities of a node failure of a specific type in failure-prone nodes versus the rest of the nodes in the systems. Each plot in Figure 6 contains three pairs of bars for each of the three systems, where each pair corresponds to a timespan: day, week, or month. The numbers on top of the bars indicate the factor increase in failure probability in a failure-prone node compared to an average node.
