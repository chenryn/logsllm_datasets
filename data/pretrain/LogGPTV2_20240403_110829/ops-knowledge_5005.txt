User: GoogleAppEngineLauncher can display the local log file of my app while it is running on my Mac during development. However, I can't change the font size there so I would like to use the tail command to watch the log file myself.
It's a shame but I can't find the log files. They are not under /var/log/, ~/Library/Logs or /Library/Logs. Do you know where they are?
(Maybe there are no physical files, just the stdout of the python development environment and so the log is only available in the launcher application.)
Assistant: Many of these answers are now outdated. :)
In today's devappserver, use --logs_path=LOGS_FILE if you want to log to a file (in its native sqlite database format). Or as suggested in a comment, simply pipe the output if that's too complicated.
Since there's a log API, it actually now stores log entries in a file in --storage_path if not set. I have noticed a few bugs myself, though. (I'll assume they don't exist now, it's been a while since I used this.)
