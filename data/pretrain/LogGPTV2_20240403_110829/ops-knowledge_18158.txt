Question: Alice and Bob are using the one-time pad encryption scheme. Due to an oversight, they reuse their \(n\)-bit key \(K\) to encrypt two different messages \(M\) and \(M'\). Eve intercepts both ciphertexts \(C\) and \(C'\). Which of the following statements are true concerning the security of the messages and the role of Eve?
"A": "Eve can determine the exact content of both messages \(M\) and \(M'\) without additional information.",
"B": "Eve can deduce \(M \oplus M'\) from \(C \oplus C'\), which may reveal patterns or redundant information.",
"C": "Eve's knowledge of \(M \oplus M'\) allows her to reconstruct the key \(K\) if she also knows one of the messages.",
"D": "Key reuse in OTP has no significant security implications and does not affect the IND-CPA security of the scheme."
Answer: BC
