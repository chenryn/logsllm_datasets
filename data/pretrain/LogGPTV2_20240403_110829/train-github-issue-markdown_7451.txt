Iâ€˜m a webgl novice.I hope get some help about mouse picking. I want to do a
street view program with webgl.so,l create a SphereGeometry,and the camera
position is in the SphereGeometry.on the street view texture,I want to mark
the point where is picked by the mouse,but I can not get the point position
maybe because the camera is in the Sphere.if I make the Sphere smaller , the
raycaster.intersectObjects( scene.children) worked and get the intersect point
's position.3q
