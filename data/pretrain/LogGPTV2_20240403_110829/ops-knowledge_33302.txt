Subject: Assistance Needed with Installing python-igraph on Windows 64-bit

Dear Community,

I am currently in need of the python-igraph package for a Windows 64-bit system. I have already installed Python 3.4, but I'm encountering difficulties finding a compatible igraph installation package. Despite extensive searches across various web resources, I have been unable to locate the appropriate version.

Could anyone kindly offer some guidance or suggestions on how to resolve this issue?

Thank you very much for your help.

Best regards,

2. Once you have downloaded the .whl file, open a command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the .whl file is located using the `cd` command.
4. Install the package using pip with the following command:
   ```
   pip install <filename>.whl
   ```

Replace `<filename>` with the actual name of the .whl file you downloaded.
