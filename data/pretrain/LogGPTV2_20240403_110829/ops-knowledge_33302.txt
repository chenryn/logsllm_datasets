User: I am looking for python-igraph package for windows 64bits. I have installed python 3.4 and it seems that I can not find proper igraph installation package for it. I have crawled all webpages and still could not find what I am looking for. 
Can anyone help me please?
Thanks
Assistant: As suggested by @Tamas, you should download wheel packages from the link and use pip to install them.
