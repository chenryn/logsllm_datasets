changes of each DDoS attack, we arrange all the geolocation
distribution values of all the DDoS attacks launched by each
family in time order. Then, we plot the geolocation distances
along time. Figure 10 and Figure 11 show the result for
Pandora and Blackenergy, respectively.

a certain mean value. This indicates that these values are
predictable or even stable.
To verify our conjecture, we next build a prediction model
over this data. To build the model, we use the Autoregressive
Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model, which is one
of the popular linear models in time series forecasting. The
popularity of the ARIMA model is because of its statistical
properties in the model building process. In addition, ARIMA
models are quite ﬂexible in that
they can present several
different types of time series [15].
To evaluate the results of our prediction model, we split our
data into two parts, the ﬁrst half is for training and the other
half is used for prediction and evaluation. For the prediction
part, we use the last 2,700 values (2,700 is a randomly picked
number. This value shouldn’t affect our prediction results).
Again, due to the space limit, we only present the results
for the same two families Pandora and Blackenergy. The
prediction results are shown in Figure 12 and Figure 13.

Time
Fig. 11. Blackenergy geolocation distances
In these two ﬁgures, the x-axis represents the time when
each snapshot was taken, and the y-axis represents the ge-
olocation distance value. From the above ﬁgures, we see that
periodic patterns exist in both cases, and the distance values
appear in stationary states, meaning that the values vary around
In these ﬁgures, the x-axis represents the predicted points
while the y-axis represents the geolocation distance value.
The predicted results are shown by the dotted red curve and
the ground truth values are marked by the blue lines. From
these ﬁgures, we can clearly observe that the predicted results
are almost identical with the ground truth value. We further
calculate the numerical statistics for all the families except for
Darkshell since there are not enough data points for training
the model. The results are listed in Table IV.

We compare two groups of artifacts in this table:
the
prediction and the ground truth values. We calculated the
mean value and the standard deviation value of both groups.
Further, we compared these two groups by calculating their
cosine similarity with each other. From this table, we can
see that for all the families, both the mean value and the
standard deviation are close to those of the ground truth, except
for family Dirtjumper and Colddeath; the predicted results
represent more than 90% similarity to the ground truth.
Insight into defenses: These results reveal several insights
including: (1) The geolocation dynamics of bots involved in
DDoS attacks exhibit certain patterns for different botnet fam-
ilies. (2) Attack source geolocation changes can be accurately
predicted by using a proper model. accurately predicted by
using a proper model. (3) Such information combined with
changes of the attack volumes can be used for forecasting how
DDoS attacks evolve over time, thus allowing one to deploy
or adjust defenses accordingly.
B. Target Analysis
Country-level analysis. Now, we turn our attention to the
country-level preference of families and their victims. The
third column in Table V shows the top ﬁve popular targeted
countries of each active family. Most families have a speciﬁc
preference over speciﬁc areas or organizations. The top ﬁve
most popular target countries are the United States of America
(USA), targeted by 13, 738 attacks, Russia, targeted by 11, 451
attacks, Germany, targeted by 5, 048 attacks, Ukraine, targeted
by 4, 078 attacks, and the Netherlands, targeted by 2, 816
attacks. The Aldibot and Dirtjumper families’ preferred target
country is the USA; Colddeath’s is India; the Optima, Pandor
and YZF families’ is Russia; the Darkshell and Nitol families’
is China and Ddoser’s is Mexico.
Organization-level analysis. Similar to country-level analysis,
we have also conducted organization-level analysis. Our results
show that the targets were narrowly distributed within several
organizations. Figure 14 shows the organization-level analysis
in February 2013 for Pandora. In this ﬁgure,
the size of
the markers on the map represents the number of attacks
toward a speciﬁc target. From this ﬁgure, we can easily
identify some hotspots in Russia and the USA. Among all
the families, Dirtjumper has a wider presence by attacking
more organizations than any other family. Also, we found
that most attacks were aimed towards web hosting services,
large-scale cloud providers and data centers, Internet domain
registers and backbone autonomous systems, where massive
