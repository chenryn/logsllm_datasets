### Geolocation Distance Analysis of DDoS Attacks

#### Introduction
To analyze the geolocation distribution changes of each DDoS attack, we organized the geolocation data for all attacks launched by each botnet family in chronological order. We then plotted the geolocation distances over time. Figures 9, 10, and 11 show the results for Pandora and Blackenergy, respectively.

#### Geolocation Distance Plots
- **Figure 9: CDF of Geolocation Distribution**
  - The Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of geolocation distances for all DDoS attacks.
  
- **Figure 10: Pandora Geolocation Distances**
  - X-axis: Time
  - Y-axis: Geolocation distance (km)
  - The plot shows periodic patterns, indicating that the geolocation distances vary around a certain mean value, suggesting predictability and stability.

- **Figure 11: Blackenergy Geolocation Distances**
  - X-axis: Time
  - Y-axis: Geolocation distance (km)
  - Similar to Pandora, the plot shows periodic patterns and stable geolocation distances.

#### Prediction Model
To validate our hypothesis, we built a prediction model using the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model, which is widely used for time series forecasting due to its statistical properties and flexibility.

- **Data Splitting**
  - The dataset was split into two parts: the first half for training and the second half for prediction and evaluation.
  - For the prediction part, we used the last 2,700 values (a randomly chosen number that does not affect the prediction results).

- **Prediction Results**
  - **Figure 12: Pandora Geolocation Distance Prediction**
    - X-axis: Predicted points
    - Y-axis: Geolocation distance (km)
    - The predicted results (dotted red curve) closely match the ground truth values (blue lines).
  
  - **Figure 13: Blackenergy Geolocation Distance Prediction**
    - X-axis: Predicted points
    - Y-axis: Geolocation distance (km)
    - The predicted results (dotted red curve) closely match the ground truth values (blue lines).

#### Statistical Analysis
We calculated the mean, standard deviation, and cosine similarity between the predicted and ground truth values for each botnet family. The results are summarized in Table IV.

- **Table IV: Statistics for Geolocation Distance Prediction**
  - **Family**: Blackenergy, Pandora, Dirtjumper, Optima, Colddeath
  - **Mean and Standard Deviation**: Close to the ground truth values for most families, except Dirtjumper and Colddeath.
  - **Cosine Similarity**: Over 90% for most families, indicating high accuracy in predictions.

#### Insights
- **Geolocation Dynamics**: Different botnet families exhibit specific patterns in their geolocation dynamics during DDoS attacks.
- **Predictive Accuracy**: The geolocation changes can be accurately predicted using appropriate models.
- **Forecasting and Defense**: Combining geolocation information with attack volume changes can help forecast the evolution of DDoS attacks, enabling better defense strategies.

### Target Analysis

#### Country-Level Analysis
- **Top Targeted Countries**:
  - USA: 13,738 attacks
  - Russia: 11,451 attacks
  - Germany: 5,048 attacks
  - Ukraine: 4,078 attacks
  - Netherlands: 2,816 attacks
- **Family Preferences**:
  - Aldibot and Dirtjumper: USA
  - Colddeath: India
  - Optima, Pandora, and YZF: Russia
  - Darkshell and Nitol: China
  - Ddoser: Mexico

#### Organization-Level Analysis
- **Target Distribution**: Narrowly distributed within several organizations.
- **Figure 14: Organization-Level Analysis for Pandora (February 2013)**
  - The size of markers on the map represents the number of attacks toward specific targets.
  - Hotspots identified in Russia and the USA.
  - Dirtjumper has the widest presence, attacking more organizations than any other family.
  - Targets include web hosting services, large-scale cloud providers, data centers, Internet domain registers, and backbone autonomous systems.

#### Table V: Country-Level DDoS Target Statistics
- **Family**: Aldibot, Blackenergy, Colddeath, Darkshell, Ddoser, Dirtjumper, Nitol, Optima, Pandora, YZF
- **Top 5 Targeted Countries**: Detailed counts for each family's top targeted countries.

This analysis provides valuable insights into the geolocation and target preferences of different DDoS botnet families, aiding in the development of more effective defense strategies.
