I appreciate the `scrollBeyondLastLine` feature, but I find that it often scrolls too far, which can be disconcerting and makes me worry that I might have accidentally cleared my file. 

It would be very helpful if the `editor.scrollBeyondLastLine` setting could be configured as either a boolean or an integer. The integer would specify the maximum number of lines to overscroll, providing more control over the scrolling behavior.

Thank you.
