## Abstract
In recent years, numerous studies have utilized the Internet's AS-level topology to perform various analyses, from understanding graph properties to evaluating the effectiveness of worm-containment strategies. However, the BGP data typically used to infer these topologies is often incomplete. Our contribution is threefold:

1. **Analysis of Current BGP Data**: We analyze BGP data collected by RouteViews, RIS, and PCH route collectors, identifying the reasons for its incompleteness. We found that large portions of the Internet are not adequately captured due to the geographic placement of current route collector feeders and BGP filters such as export policies and decision processes.

2. **Methodology for Optimal Route Collector Placement**: We propose a methodology to determine the optimal number of ASes that should join a route collector project to obtain a more accurate view of the Internet's AS-level topology. We applied this methodology to both the global AS-level topology and five regional AS-level topologies, highlighting the importance of considering regional characteristics.

3. **Characterization of Optimal ASes**: We provide a detailed characterization of the ASes that are part of at least one optimal solution set. Our analysis reveals that the current route collector infrastructure is rarely connected to these ASes, indicating the need for a more comprehensive route collector infrastructure.

## 1. Introduction
Over the past few years, the Internet has become an integral part of daily life for billions of people. It enables activities such as instant global communication, remote banking, and real-time information access. Despite its pervasiveness, there is limited understanding of the Internet's actual structure and the behavior of data once it leaves a home router. This lack of knowledge poses a significant challenge, as structural problems or vulnerabilities may go undetected until an outage occurs.

To address this, researchers have analyzed the Internet from a topological perspective, with the AS-level topology being a key focus. In this topology, each node represents an AS (an organization managing IP subnets), and edges represent BGP connections between ASes. Common approaches involve using BGP route collectors and Traceroute monitors to extract AS-level information. While several studies have highlighted issues with Traceroute data, fewer have examined the limitations of BGP data, particularly its incompleteness.

Our contributions are threefold:
1. **Analysis of BGP Data**: We analyze BGP data from RouteViews, RIS, and PCH, explaining the causes of its incompleteness. We show that the current view of the Internet is narrow and biased, primarily due to the low number of ASes feeding the route collectors and their nature (mostly managed by global ISPs). This top-down view fails to capture many p2p connections among lower-tier ASes.

2. **Methodology for Optimal AS Selection**: To overcome the incompleteness, we develop a methodology to select the minimum number of ASes that should provide full routing information to the route collector infrastructure. We formulate a Minimum Set Cover (MSC) problem, leveraging inter-AS p2c-distance, and apply it to both the global and regional AS-level topologies.

3. **Characterization of Selected ASes**: We analyze the ASes identified as part of the optimal solution, finding that they are rarely connected to the current route collector infrastructure. This highlights the need for a more geographically diverse and comprehensive route collector infrastructure.

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews related work, Section 3 analyzes the current BGP data and its limitations, Section 4 describes our proposed methodology, and Section 5 presents the results. Section 6 concludes the paper.

## 2. Related Work
Initial concerns about the incompleteness of BGP data were raised in [11], but quantification efforts only began later. In [12], the authors compared BGP-derived topologies with those from Internet Routing Registries (IRRs), revealing that about 40% of connections were missing in BGP-derived topologies. This topic was revisited in [13] and [5]. In [13], the redundancy of BGP data from participating ASes was analyzed, while [5] compared BGP-derived topologies with proprietary router configurations from major ISPs, research networks, and content providers. Although [5] provided significant insights, its results were not reproducible and were biased by the selected ground truth. The economic relationships between ASes, as described in [14], play a crucial role in the visibility of BGP data, with p2p connections often hidden from providers and peers.

Despite the evidence of BGP data incompleteness, few works have addressed the placement of new BGP monitors. In [15], a model based on biological population estimation techniques was extended to the Internet AS graph, suggesting that 700 route monitors could cover most connections. However, this heuristic did not fully account for inter-AS economic relationships, leading to underestimation of the required monitors.

## 3. The Dark Side of BGP-Based Measurements
BGP data is the best source for inferring the Internet's AS-level topology, as it directly contains AS-level information in the AS Path attribute. BGP route collectors receive routing information from cooperating ASes (BGP feeders). In this section, we analyze the incompleteness of BGP data, focusing on the current route collector projects, the contribution of each BGP feeder, and the impact of geographical distribution on discovering regional Internet properties.

### 3.1 BGP Route Collector Projects
There are three main projects that collect and publicly share BGP data: RouteViews, RIS, and PCH. RouteViews, initiated at the University of Oregon in 1997, provides real-time information on the global routing system. RIS, developed by RIPE, collects and stores routing data from multiple locations worldwide. PCH, a non-profit research institute, supports operations and analysis in Internet traffic exchange, routing economics, and global network development. As of February 2012, RouteViews had 10 active route collectors, RIS had 13, and PCH had 51. Table 1 details the number of BGP feeders per route collector and their geographical location.

### 3.2 BGP Feeder Contribution Analysis
Despite the well-known goals of these projects, many BGP feeders do not provide significant contributions. We categorize BGP feeders based on the amount of IPv4 space they advertise: minor feeders announce less than a /8 subnet, full feeders announce close to the full Internet IPv4 space, and partial feeders fall in between. Figure 2 shows the amount of non-overlapping IPv4 addresses announced by BGP feeders of each project. Only about one in four or five feeders in RouteViews and RIS announce the full routing table, while the percentage is much lower in PCH.

## 4. Proposed Monitor Placement Methodology
To address the incompleteness of BGP data, we propose a methodology to select the optimal number of ASes that should join a route collector project. We formulate a Minimum Set Cover (MSC) problem, which is NP-complete, but we exploit graph properties to reduce the search space. We apply this methodology to both the global and regional AS-level topologies, highlighting the impact of geographical peculiarities on the selection of ASes.

### 4.1 Definition of p2c-Distance
We introduce a novel metric called p2c-distance, which accounts for the presence of BGP decision processes and export policies. This metric provides a better understanding of the completeness of BGP data.

## 5. Results
We analyze the results of our methodology on the global and regional AS-level topologies. We find that some regions, such as Africa, completely hide their p2p connectivity from the current route collector infrastructure. We provide a ranked list of ASes that should be prioritized for joining a route collector project.

## 6. Conclusion
This work provides a systematic approach to enhance the coverage of current route collectors by identifying the ASes that should feed them in every continent. Our methodology and results highlight the need for a more comprehensive and geographically diverse route collector infrastructure.
