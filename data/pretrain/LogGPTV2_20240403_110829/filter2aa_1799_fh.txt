Forces physical addresses below the speci-
fied value to be avoided by the boot loader 
as much as possible. Sometimes required

Page List (see Part 1, Chapter 5, “Memory 
management,” for more information on the 
page lists).

rate (19200) at which a remote kernel debug-
ger host will connect through a serial port.
bootdebug

DEBUGGER_ENABLED
Enables remote boot debugging for the 
boot loader. With this option enabled, you 
can use Kd.exe or Windbg.exe to connect to 
the boot loader.
bootems
Boolean
EMS_ENABLED
Causes Windows to enable Emergency 
Management Services (EMS) for boot appli-
cations, which reports boot information and 
accepts system management commands 
through a serial port.

String
DEBUGGER_BUS
_PARAMETERS
If a physical PCI debugging device is used 
to provide kernel debugging, specifies the 
PCI bus, function, and device number (or the 
ACPI DBG table index) for the device.
channel
Channel between 0
and 62
DEBUGGER_1394
_CHANNEL
Used in conjunction with  1394 
to specify the IEEE 1394 channel through 
which kernel debugging communications 
will flow.

BCD Element Code2
Meaning
configaccesspolicy
Default,
DisallowMmConfig
CONFIG_ACCESS
_POLICY
Configures whether the system uses 
memory-mapped I/O to access the PCI 
manufacturer’s configuration space or falls 
back to using the HAL’s I/O port access rou-
tines. Can sometimes be helpful in solving 
platform device problems.
debugaddress
Hardware address
DEBUGGER_PORT
_ADDRESS
Specifies the hardware address of the serial 
(COM) port used for debugging.
debugport
COM port number
DEBUGGER_PORT
_NUMBER

port (usually COM2 on systems with at least 
two serial ports) to which a remote kernel 
debugger host is connected.
debugstart
Active, AutoEnable, 
Disable
DEBUGGER_START
_POLICY
Specifies settings for the debugger when ker-
nel debugging is enabled. AutoEnable enables 
the debugger when a breakpoint or kernel 
exception, including kernel crashes, occurs.
debugtype
Serial, 1394, USB, or Net
DEBUGGER_TYPE
Specifies whether kernel debugging will be 
communicated through a serial, FireWire (IEEE 
1394), USB, or Ethernet port. (The default is 
serial.)
