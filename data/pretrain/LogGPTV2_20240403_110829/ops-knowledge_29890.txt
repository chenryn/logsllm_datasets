User: I am running a Python script on Google's AppEngine. The python script is very basic. Every time the script runs i need it to update a timestamp SOMEWHERE so i can record and keep track of when the script last ran. This will allow me to do logic based on when the last time the script ran, etc. At the end of the script i'll update the timestamp to the current time. 
Using Google's NBD seems to be overkill for this but it also seems to be the only way to store ANY data in AppEngine. Is there a better/easier way to do what i want?
Assistant: Another way to solve this, that i found, is to use memcache. It's super easy. Though it should probably be noted that memcache could be cleared at anytime, so NDB is probably a better solution. 
Set the timestamp:

memcache.set("timestamp", current_timestamp)

Then, to read the timestamp: 

memcache.get("timestamp")
