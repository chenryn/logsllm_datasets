titleblackhat:us-22 Invisible Finger: Practical Electromagnetic Interference Attack on Touchscreen-based Electronic Devices
Touchscreen-based electronic devices such as smart phones and smart tablets are widely used in our daily life. While the security of electronic devices has been heavily investigated recently, the resilience of touchscreens against various attacks has yet to be thoroughly investigated. In this presentation, for the first time, we show how touchscreen devices are vulnerable to Intentional Electromagnetic Interference (IEMI) attacks in a systematic and practical way.Not only showing how practical IEMI attacks are established on touchscreens, we will also analyze and quantify the underlying mechanism allowing our novel touchscreen attacks in detail. We will show and explain how to calculate the minimum amount of electric field and signal frequency required to induce false touch events. The induced touch events allow attackers to remotely perform short-tap, long-press, and omni-directional gesture on touchscreen devices under a regular conference table without physically touching the victim devices. Beyond simply showing how to generate touch events under an ideal scenario, we will introduce our novel and necessary techniques to build up the attack chains in a practical way, such as designing and using a phone locator to infer the position and orientation of the target smart phone out of sight, knowing if the injected IEMI signal works without seeing the screen, etc. We will show and explain how our state-of-the-art attack can be remotely used on different touchscreen devices and deliver practical attack outcomes, including unlocking gesture based pin lock, installing malware on Android devices, and connecting Siri on iOS devices.
