Azure Data Explorer offers continuous ingestion from Azure Storage (Azure Blob storage and Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2) using an [Event Grid Ingestion pipeline](ingest-data-event-grid-overview.md). In the Event Grid ingestion pipeline, an Azure Event Grid service routes blob created or blob renamed events from a storage account to Azure Data Explorer via an Azure Event Hubs.
In this article, you learn how to manually create the resources needed for Event Grid Ingestion: an Event Grid subscription, an Event Hubs namespace, and an event hub. Event Hubs namespace and event hub creation are described in the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites). To use automatic creation of these resources while defining the Event Grid ingestion, see [Create an Event Grid data connection in Azure Data Explorer](ingest-data-event-grid.md).
## Prerequisites
* An Azure subscription. Create a [free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* An Azure Data Explorer cluster and database. [Create a cluster and database](create-cluster-and-database.md).
* A [storage account](/azure/storage/common/storage-quickstart-create-account?tabs=azure-portal). An Event Grid notification subscription can be set on Azure Storage accounts for `BlobStorage`, `StorageV2`, or [Data Lake Storage Gen2](/azure/storage/blobs/data-lake-storage-introduction).
* An [Event Hubs namespace and event hub](/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-create).
> [!NOTE]
> For best performance, create all resources in the same region as the Azure Data Explorer cluster.
## Create an Event Grid subscription
1. In the Azure portal, go to your storage account.
1. In the left menu, select **Events** > **Event Subscription**.
     :::image type="content" source="media/eventgrid/create-event-grid-subscription-1.png" alt-text="Screenshot of create Event Grid subscription.":::
1. In the **Create Event Subscription** window within the **Basic** tab, provide the following values:
    :::image type="content" source="media/eventgrid/create-event-grid-subscription-2.png" alt-text="Create event subscription values to enter.":::
    |**Setting** | **Suggested value** | **Field description**|
    |---|---|---|
    | Name | *test-grid-connection* | The name of the event grid subscription that you want to create.|
    | Event Schema | *Event Grid Schema* | The schema that should be used for the Event Grid. |
    | Topic Type | *Storage account* | The type of event grid topic. Automatically populated.|
    | Source Resource | *gridteststorage1* | The name of your storage account. Automatically populated.|
    | System Topic Name | *gridteststorage1...* | The system topic where Azure Storage publishes events. This system topic then forwards the event to a subscriber that receives and processes events. Automatically populated.|
    | Filter to Event Types | *Blob Created* | Which specific events to get notified for. When creating the subscription, select one of the supported types: Microsoft.Storage.BlobCreated or Microsoft.Storage.BlobRenamed. Blob renaming is supported only for ADLSv2 storage. |
1. In **ENDPOINT DETAILS**, select **Event Hubs**.
    :::image type="content" source="media/eventgrid/endpoint-details.png" alt-text="Pick an event handler to receive your events - event hub - Azure Data Explorer.":::
1. Click **Select an endpoint** and fill in the event hub you created, for example *test-hub*.
1. Select the **Filters** tab if you want to filter events.
    Use **Subject Filters** to track specific subjects events. Set the filters for the notifications as follows:
    :::image type="content" source="media/eventgrid/filters-tab.png" alt-text="Filters tab event grid.":::
   1. Select **Enable subject filtering**
   1. **Subject Begins With** field is the *literal* prefix of the subject. Since the pattern applied is *startswith*, it can span multiple containers, folders, or blobs. No wildcards are allowed.
       * To define a filter on the blob container, set the field as follows: *`/blobServices/default/containers/[container prefix]`*.
       * To define a filter on a blob prefix (or a folder in Azure Data Lake Gen2), set the field as follows: *`/blobServices/default/containers/[container name]/blobs/[folder/blob prefix]`*.
   1. **Subject Ends With** field is the *literal* suffix of the blob. No wildcards are allowed.
   1. **Case-sensitive subject matching** field indicates whether the prefix and suffix filters are case-sensitive.
    For more information about filtering events, see [blob storage events](/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-event-overview#filtering-events).
    Use **Advanced Filters** to add custom filters that meet your requirements.
    For example, When using the [Azure Data Lake SDK](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Azure.Storage.Files.DataLake/) to upload a file, file creation triggers an Event Grid event with size 0. This event is discarded by Azure Data Explorer. File flushing triggers another event if the *Close* parameter is set to *true*. This event indicates that this is the final update and the file stream has been closed.
    To avoid unnecessary processing and empty file ingestion errors, filter out *CreateFile* events using the following filter:
    :::image type="content" source="media/eventgrid/filter-out-create-file.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to filter out create file events.":::
    |**Setting** | **Suggested value** | **Field description**|
    |---|---|---|
    |Key | *data.api* | The field in the event schema used for filtering. |
    |Operator | *String is not in* | An operator to be evaluates on the selected key. |
    |Value | *CreateFile* | The value used to evaluate the key. |
1. Select **Create**
