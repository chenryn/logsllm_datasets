The `skipchars` function experienced a 5x decrease in performance (as measured by the benchmarks in BaseBenchmarks). This degradation is likely due to the introduction of locks on the `write` calls.

One potential solution could be to acquire the lock before entering the loop, perform the write operations without locking, and then release the lock once all writes are complete. This approach may help mitigate the performance impact.
