User: I need to automate the changing of the hostname of a computer, but I can't figure out how to do it inside a program. My options are open; I would be happy with a solution in any of the following:
Command line
Java
Python
C# (would prefer one of the other 3, but this is ok)
It would be helpful to learn how to do this on both Linux and Windows.
Assistant: In Windows you have to modify registry keys and the reboot the system.
You actually have to change two entries:
HostName under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\TcpIp\Parameters
and
ComputerName under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\ComputerName\ComputerName
Please note that if the computer ha joined an NT Domain this change could be harmful (and in this case you have an additional entry to change under TcpIp\Parameters).
