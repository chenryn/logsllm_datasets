## Steps to Reproduce
Create a static final:
    final sampleLocks = [
      new Lock("L1", 5.0, "flo"),
      new Lock("L2", 2.5, "flo"),
      new Lock("L3", 4.0, "chris"),
      new Lock("L4", 1.1, "flo"),
      new Lock("L5", 4.2, "chris"),
    ];
Modify it (changing the individual numbers).  
Do a hot reload.
Due to limitations of the VM, the value is not updated in the program, and the
hot reload "doesn't work".  
There should be a warning somewhere, that a static final has been updated and
that the hot-reload will not necessarily take these changes into account.
