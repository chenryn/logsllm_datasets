B. Scheme Deﬁnitions and Security Properties
We present the protocols that comprise a threshold creden-
tials scheme:
O Setup(1λ) → (params): deﬁnes the system parameters
params with respect to the security parameter λ. These
parameters are publicly available.
O KeyGen(params) → (sk, vk):
is run by the authorities
to generate their secret key sk and veriﬁcation key vk from
the public params.
O AggKey(vk1, . . . , vkt) → (vk):
is run by whoever wants
to verify a credential to aggregate any subset of t veriﬁcation
keys vki
into a single consolidated veriﬁcation key vk.
AggKey needs to be run only once.
O IssueCred(m, φ) → (σ):
is an interactive protocol be-
tween a user and each authority, by which the user obtains
3
a credential σ embedding the private attribute m satisfying
the statement φ.
O AggCred(σ1, . . . , σt) → (σ):
is run by the user to ag-
gregate any subset of t partial credentials σi into a single
consolidated credential.
O ProveCred(vk, m, φ(cid:48)) → (Θ, φ(cid:48)):
is run by the user to
compute a proof Θ of possession of a credential certifying
that the private attribute m satisﬁes the statement φ(cid:48) (under
the corresponding veriﬁcation key vk).
O VerifyCred(vk, Θ, φ(cid:48)) → (true/f alse):
is run by who-
ever wants to verify a credential embedding a private at-
tribute satisfying the statement φ(cid:48), using the veriﬁcation key
vk and cryptographic material Θ generated by ProveCred.
A threshold credential scheme must satisfy the following
