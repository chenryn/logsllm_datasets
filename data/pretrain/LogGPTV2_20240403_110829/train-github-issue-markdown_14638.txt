# Description of the new feature/enhancement
There doesn't seem to be an obvious way to detect when running from the
terminal. This is a issue for applications and libraries where behavior is
dependent on the terminal. For example, a Python library may require colorama
for some terminals and not others.
# Proposed technical implementation details
The most common and portable way to do this is to set the TERM environment
variable when initializing the terminal.
