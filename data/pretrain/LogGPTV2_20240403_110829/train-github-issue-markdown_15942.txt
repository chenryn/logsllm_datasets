When running the following command:

```bash
deno run --v8-flags=--disallow-code-generation-from-strings index.ts
```

with `index.ts` containing:

```typescript
console.log("Hello World!");
```

Deno panics with the following error:

**Error Details:**
- **Platform:** Windows x86_64
- **Version:** 1.29.2
- **Arguments:** `["deno", "run", "--v8-flags=--disallow-code-generation-from-strings", "TestFlags.ts"]`

**Stack Trace:**

```plaintext

```

### Explanation:
The `--v8-flags=--disallow-code-generation-from-strings` flag prevents the V8 JavaScript engine from generating code from strings, which is a security measure. However, Deno's internal bootstrap script relies on this functionality, leading to the panic.

### Suggested Solution:
If you need to use this V8 flag for security reasons, you may need to find an alternative approach or ensure that the code does not rely on features that require code generation from strings. Alternatively, you can avoid using this flag if it is not strictly necessary for your use case.
