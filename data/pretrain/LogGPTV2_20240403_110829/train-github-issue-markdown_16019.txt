# Summary of the new feature/enhancement
As a developer we are always working with multiple terminal windows at the
moment, tabs make it easier, but makes it difficult in certain scenarios. If
we have an ability to split the terminal screen vertically and horizontally
just as ConEmu allow. It would be great.
Use Case: Some times in Platform IO IOT development the different tools run on
different python version, we have to execute some commands (build. deploy)
from same path but as the python version is different, we have to open two
different terminals. It would be enhancing the productivity of developer if
he's able to see the results on same window split to multiple terminals.
