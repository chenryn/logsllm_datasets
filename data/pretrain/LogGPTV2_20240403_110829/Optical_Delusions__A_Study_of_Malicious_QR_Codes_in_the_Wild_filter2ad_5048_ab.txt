### Research on Malicious QR Codes

#### Introduction
In our study, we added to the list of websites some that were more likely to contain malicious QR codes. Specifically, we included a set of randomly selected malicious websites from the repository described in Section III-A3. Given that our experiments were conducted over three separate time intervals, we created independent initial seeds for the crawler in each experiment to cover different parts of the web. For the first two experimental runs, we chose a set of top-level pages as crawl seeds and restricted the crawler to a depth of three to balance the coverage of web pages across multiple domains. In the final experiment, we lifted the link depth restriction in our crawling policy to cover more web pages within the crawled domains.

#### Methodology
**Crawling Strategy:**
- **Initial Seeds:** We used a set of top-level pages as initial seeds.
- **Link Depth Restriction:** For the first two experiments, the crawler was restricted to a depth of three. In the last experiment, this restriction was lifted.
- **Coverage:** This approach ensured a balanced coverage of web pages across multiple domains.

**Limitations:**
1. **User Behavior Analysis:** Our study does not account for how real users might react to these attacks or which scenarios are more dangerous from their perspective, as this would require a behavioral analysis of users exposed to real attacks.
2. **Sampling Representativeness:** Our results are based on a sampling of web pages from different categories, which may not be representative of the entire web. We focused on what we believe are interesting parts of the web from an attacker’s perspective, but this sample may not reflect what most users encounter while browsing.
3. **Detection Functionality:** Our current detection function cannot recognize QR codes that are a smaller portion of a larger image, leading to potential undetected QR codes. Additionally, QR codes in complex formats (e.g., videos, flash animations) are not analyzed due to performance constraints.

Despite these limitations, our study is a significant step forward in analyzing malicious QR codes and the threats they pose.

#### Ethical Considerations
- **Publicly Available Content:** We only crawled publicly available content on the web.
- **Non-Malicious Intent:** Our experiments were designed not to attack the websites, expose vulnerabilities, or jeopardize the security and privacy of website operators or users.
- **Robot Exclusion Protocol:** Our crawler complied with the Robot Exclusion protocol, automatically removing websites that disallowed crawling.
- **Load Management:** To limit the load on the contacted websites, we added an artificial delay between successive requests to the same server.

#### Evaluation
**Crawling Summary:**
- **Total URLs Crawled:** 14.7 million
- **QR Codes Extracted:** 94,770 (approximately one for every 156 web pages visited)
- **Malicious QR Codes Found:** 145 distinct malicious QR codes

**Distribution of QR Codes:**
- **Web Categories:** The distribution of QR codes among different web categories is presented in Table II.
- **Proof-of-Concept Attacks:** We found 28 proof-of-concept QR code attacks on security blogs, which were excluded from the malicious data set.

**Results:**
- **CDF of Benign and Malicious QR Codes:** Figure 3 shows the cumulative distribution of benign and malicious QR codes found over time.
- **Link Depth and QR Code Incidence:** Figure 4 indicates that following links up to a depth of three reaches only 48% of all QR codes.
- **Malicious Web Objects:** Figure 5 shows the types and proportions of malicious web objects found at each link depth, suggesting that most malicious binaries were injected in the first three depths, while malicious web pages were mainly observed at greater depths.

**Discussion:**
- **QR Code Usage:** Table III presents the distribution of web objects spread via QR codes among different categories. 38.7% of extracted QR codes directed users to other web pages.
- **Chi-Square Test:** A chi-square test (χ² = 13930.71, df = 30, p-value < 2.2 × 10⁻¹⁶) indicates a significant relationship between the type of web objects and different web categories.
- **Free Downloads Category:** Figure 6 provides an approximate view of the final destinations of QR codes in the free downloads category, with the most common use being educational (34.3%).

**Conclusion:**
Our results indicate that while there is some interest and activity related to malicious QR codes, the relatively low rate of these attacks suggests that users are rarely exposed to threats spread by QR codes. Further research is needed to better understand the behavior of users and the broader impact of such attacks.
