by Alexa [10].
In addition, we added to the list some websites that were
more likely to contain malicious QR codes. For this, we

also included a set of randomly- selected malicious websites
from the repository described in Section III-A3. Since we
performed the experiments over three separate time intervals,
we created independent initial seeds for the crawler in each
experiment to cover different parts of the web. For the first
two experimental runs, we chose a set of top-level pages as
crawl seeds and restricted the crawler to a depth of three to
balance the coverage of web pages across multiple domains.
In the last experiment, we lifted the link depth restriction in
our crawling policy to cover more web pages of the crawled
domains.
B. Limitations
Our study has a set of limitations due to our detection
techniques, the nature of the web, and QR codes themselves.
First, we cannot extrapolate how real users might react to these
attacks or what types of scenarios are more dangerous from
the user perspective, since this would require performing a
behavioral analysis of the users when they are exposed to
real attacks. Second, our results are based on a sampling of
web pages from different categories which is not necessarily
representative of the entire web. We tried to explore what
we believe are interesting parts of the web from an attacker’s
perspective. However, we cannot prove that this is a sample
of what most users encounter while browsing the web or those
categories as a whole. Finally, since our current detection
function cannot recognize QR codes that are a smaller portion
of a larger image, some QR codes might fail to be detected by
our current approach. Similarly, QR codes might be found less
frequently in complex formats (e.g., videos, flash animations),
which we do not currently analyze for performance reasons.
Thus, there might be other scenarios or techniques that employ
QR codes to attract unsophisticated users that we did not
recognize, although this last limitation could be ameliorated
by a more sophisticated detection function.
Despite these limitations, our study is a first step forward
in analyzing malicious QR codes in the wild and the threats
they pose.
C. Ethical Considerations
We only crawled publicly available content on the web for
our research and analysis. Our experiments were designed not
to attack the websites we contacted, to expose vulnerabilities,
or to jeopardize the security and privacy of the website
operators or users. Furthermore, our crawler was configured
to comply with the Robot Exclusion protocol. Consequently,
websites that disallowed crawling were automatically removed
from the list of crawled URLs. Finally, in order to limit the
load incurred by our crawler on the websites we contacted,
we added an artificial delay between successive requests to
the same server.
IV. Evaluation
Table I presents a summary of our crawling experiments
since December 2012. In total, we crawled over 14.7 million
URLs in three separate crawls over a ten-month period. Our
crawler extracted 94,770 QR codes, approximately one for
every 156 web pages that were visited. Many of those QR
codes were extracted from websites that employed QR codes
to promote products or services (e.g., electronics, special
events) or that describe marketing strategies relying on QR
codes.
Figure 3 shows how QR codes were collected over time.
The sharp increase after month five is due to lifting the link
depth restriction that was imposed up to that point in time. In
total, we found 145 distinct malicious QR codes during the
course of our measurements.
Figure 4 shows the distribution of how many links had to
be followed to reach a QR code. Our observations suggest that
in order to reach more than 95% of QR codes, a user needs

TABLE II: Distribution of identified QR codes among different
categories.
We also found 28 malicious proof-of-concept QR code
attacks on security blogs. We did not consider these as real
QR code attacks, and excluded them from our malicious data
set.
Our results indicate that there is some interest and activity
related to malicious QR codes. However, the relatively low
rate of these attacks implies that users are rarely exposed to
threats spread by QR codes.
A. Discussion
Table II presents the total number of QR codes and their
distribution among different web categories. To better evaluate
the use of QR codes on the web, we present a distribution of
objects referenced by identified QR codes in different web
categories in Table III. We list the most and least frequent
categories where the web objects were reached via QR codes.
In order to label resources with categories, each object was
downloaded and associated with the proper type by using file

reaching a QR code increases significantly if links of depth greater
than three are followed.
to follow at least five links. By following links up to a depth
of three, only 48% of all QR codes can be reached.
Figure 5 shows the types and proportions of malicious web
objects found at each link depth. The results suggest that most
of the malicious binaries, including APKs and EXEs, were
injected in the first three depths. However, malicious web
pages distributed by QR codes were mainly observed at depths
greater than three.

extensions and contents. Comparing the results of different
web objects shows that 38% of the extracted QR codes
were designed to direct users to other web pages. We also
noticed some interest in using QR codes to directly download
executable artifacts. For example, more than 16% of identified
QR codes were used to directly download Windows EXE
files. We also found 368 QR codes during the course of our
measurements that were used to directly download Android
APK files. However, since some of the extracted URLs were
dead or broken, we could only collect 277 APK files from
the extracted URLs. 186 (67.1%) of the downloaded APK
files were free versions of paid Android apps. 48 (17.3%)
of the downloaded APK files were applications for managing
smartphones or playing multimedia. We also found 43 (15.5%)
APK files promoted as QR code reader apps for Android
smartphones.
To answer the question of whether there exists a relationship
between the type of web objects distributed via QR codes
and different neighborhoods of the web, we performed a chi-
square test on the data from Table III using a significance level
of (cid:11) = 0:05. Based on the number of web objects in each
category, the chi-square statistic ((cid:31)2 = 13930:71, df = 30,
p-value < 2:2 (cid:2) 10
(cid:0)16 which is less than (cid:11)) indicates that
the relationship between the type of web objects and different
web categories does in fact exist.
Since a large proportion of the identified QR codes pointed
users to other web pages (38.7%), we analyzed these QR
codes to identify the places where users are typically directed
to. We manually analyzed those found in the free downloads
category to gain a better understanding of scenarios that exist
on the web. Because we did not observe substantial differences
between this category and others, we have not provided a
similar detailed analysis for other categories. Figure 6 provides
an approximate view of final destinations of QR codes in the
free downloads category. Based on our data, the most common
use of QR codes was to demonstrate the use of QR codes in
marketing campaigns and advertisements. We classified this

type of QR code as educational, which comprised 34.3% of
the identified QR codes. 19.4% of QR codes were designed
to direct users to Facebook pages to “like” certain pages. We
classified this type of QR code as Facebook likes. 9.8% of
identified QR codes were used to direct users to online review
websites to read other users’ posts about an application before
downloading it. We labeled this type of QR code app reviews.
17.1% of the identified QR codes were the output samples of
particular QR code applications or links to download QR code
reader applications. 9.7% of the extracted QR codes were used
to encourage users to sign up for newsletters to receive news
about discounted or free goods. 7.2% of the QR codes were
pointing to domain names that were not possible to resolve.
We also found a small portion of QR codes (2.4%) that were
designed to direct users to buy game credits from legitimate
websites.
During the course of the experiments, we also wanted to
understand whether websites in certain web categories are used
