accurately reﬂect network delays, rather than operating-system introduced delay.
Probes should be sent according to the intended process (i.e., periodic probes, or
probes sent according to a geometric process), as closely as possible in order to
limit measurement bias. Since timestamps are applied by a single host, there are
no time synchronization requirements.
Packet pair spacings should follow the intended spacing as closely as possible
on transmission and measured spacings at a receiver should accurately reﬂect
the spacing of the packet pair.
Inferences are typically made based on small
perturbations in spacings, e.g., on the order of tens or hundreds of microseconds,
so measurement accuracy is critical to overall algorithmic accuracy (e.g., see
[41]). Timestamps applied to packets should accurately reﬂect the actual spacing
of packets upon sending, and upon receipt. The intended probe process should
be accurately followed in order to limit measurement bias.
A high degree of accuracy in the probe emission process is required for BAD-
ABING. Probe pairs are sent at consecutive discrete time slots, with the discrete
time interval set (by default) at 5 milliseconds. BADABING also uses measure-
ments of one-way delay to infer congestion along a path. Note that in this paper,
we turn off this inference capability of BADABING, relying only on actual packet
loss.
measured with BADABING probes were conﬁned to the hosts them-
selves and were completely spurious from a network measurement
perspective. These results clearly pose a signiﬁcant problem not
only to network inference algorithms, but to any experiments de-
ployed on shared testbeds that may be sensitive to loss (e.g., through-
put experiments of different applications or transport protocols).

timestamps. With respect to errors in initial spacings, we com-
pare the difference in spacing that a process attempts to achieve,
and the actual spacing obtained. Typically, initial packet pair spac-
ings are on the order of tens or hundreds of microseconds (e.g., the
spacing of a back-to-back pair of 1500 byte packets on Fast Ether-
net is about 120 microseconds). In software, these ﬁne timescale
spacings are generally produced by busy-waiting between system
calls to emit packets since most commodity operating system timer
functions cannot deliver accuracy on these timescales. For times-
tamping error, we examine the differences between the timestamps
applied by a sending user process to a packet pair and the actual
spacing of the packet pair on the wire as measured using the DAG
cards. We also examine the differences between the timestamps ap-
plied to packet pairs by a receiver process, and the actual spacing
of the packet pair just prior to reception by the receiving host, also
measured using the DAG cards.
We found that errors on initial spacings are consistent with the
results from [41], namely, that while there can be variability in-
troduced in spacings due to system load and the operating system
scheduler, the mean error is close to zero when considering a few
