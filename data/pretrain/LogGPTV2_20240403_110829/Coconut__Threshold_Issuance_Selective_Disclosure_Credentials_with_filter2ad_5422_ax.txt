de-anonymize [30], and recent works aim to reduce the compu-
tational overhead of Zcash hidden transactions [12]. Coconut
provides efﬁcient proofs taking only a few milliseconds (see
Section VI), and makes hidden transactions practical. Trust
assumptions in Zcash are different from Coconut. However,
instead of assuming a threshold number of honest authorities,
Zcash relies on zk-SNARKs which assumes a setup algorithm
executed by a trusted authority10. M¨obius [39]—which was
developed concurrently—is a coin tumbler based on Ethereum
smart contracts that achieves strong notions of anonymity and
low off-chain communication complexity. M¨obius relies on
ring signatures to allow parties to prove group membership
without revealing exactly which public key belongs to them.
Our tumbler uses Coconut to instantiate a pegged side-
chain [3], providing stronger value transfer anonymity than
the original cryptocurrency platform,
through unlinkability
between issuing a credential representing an e-coin [20], and
spending it. The tumbler application is based on the Coconut
contract
library and an application speciﬁc smart contract
called “tumbler”.
A set of authorities jointly create an instance of the Coconut
smart contract as described in Section IV-A and specify the
smart contract handling the coins of the underlying blockchain
as callback. Speciﬁcally, the callback requires a coin transfer
to a buffer account. Then users execute the callback and pay
v coins to the buffer to ask a credential on the public attribute
v, and on two private attributes: the user’s private key k and
a randomly generated sequence number s (). Note that to
prevent tracing trafﬁc analysis, v should be limited to a speciﬁc
set of possible values (similar to cash denominations). The
request is accepted by the blockchain only if the user deposited
v coins to the buffer account ().
Each authority monitors the blockchain and detects the
request (); and issues a partial credential to the user (either
on chain or off-chain) (). The user aggregates all partial
