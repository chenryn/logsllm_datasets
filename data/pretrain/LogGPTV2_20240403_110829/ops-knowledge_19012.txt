User: I'm looking for a way to implement SSH Dynamic Port Forwarding ('ssh -D') under Python. The problem is that it has to work under Windows, i.e., running SSH with popen/pexec/etc. won't work. Any ideas?
cheers,
Bruno Nery.
Assistant: There are ssh executables for Windows, so you can uses the subprocess.Popen approach. This is not exactly elegant, a pure Python approach would be better.
