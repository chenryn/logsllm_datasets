scores above 70 are indicative of good overall usability. The
score for the playfulness of the challenges came to be 3.36
(standard deviation = 1.40) and the easiness of the chal-
lenges was 4.58 (standard deviation = 0.77). This suggests
that the participants found the game challenges to be very
easy (although not necessarily playful). These results overall
bode well for the user experience of Gametrics.
Application Scenarios: Gametrics can be utilized as a
point-of-entry mechanisms, such as to authenticate the user
to a web server.
Graphical passwords were founded on a psychological
principle that the human brain has superior memory for pro-
cessing visual rather than textual information (see two excel-
lent surveys [3,30]). They can be based on recognition, such
as those involving Random Arts images [23], objects (Pas-
sObjects) [34] and faces (PassFaces) [22], as well as on recall
or cued recall, such as those involving drawings [8, 14] and
selection of points on an image (PassPoints) [33]. Gamet-
rics can be integrated with graphical passwords as a second
factor authentication, which would enhance the security of
graphical passwords against shoulder surﬁng and spooﬁng
attacks. Further work is needed to realize such two-factor
designs.
Gametrics can be also used as a fall-back authentication
mechanism. In such use case, multiple instances of the chal-
lenges can be presented to the user, since fall-back does not
happen frequently. However, in order to build an up-to-date
classiﬁcation model for the user, the system may need to ask
285
the user to solve challenges periodically. Future investiga-
tion is necessary to study Gametrics in the context of such
fall-back authentication applications.
Given the popularity of touchscreen games, Gametrics
would ﬁt well on touchscreen devices. Here, Gametrics can
utilize the various sensors, such as accelerometer and gyro-
scope, available on these devices to measure the users’ im-
plicit interactions with these devices, which when combined
with other explicit touchscreen interaction features may en-
hance the overall classiﬁcation accuracy and resistance to
attacks. In our future work, we will study the eﬀectiveness
of Gametrics for authenticating the users on such devices.
Recently, Google has announced a plan to eliminate pass-
words by introducing a Trust API that uses a fusion of mul-
tiple biometrics indicators to verify the user’s identity, such
as face recognition and voice patterns, and other behavioral
biometrics such as the gait biometrics [13]. In the future,
we hope that Gametrics can be added to the Trust API by
asking the user to play a game challenge on a periodic basis.
Limitations: Gametrics is similar to any other behavioral
biometrics in that, we believe, it will suﬀer from a degra-
dation in the accuracy of user identiﬁcation when the user’s
behavior is undergoing a signiﬁcant variation, such as chang-
ing emotions [9], falling sick or getting injured. The eﬀect of
behavioral changes on the performance of Gametrics should
be subject to future work.
Future work may also need to be conducted to test the ac-
curacy of the Gametrics classiﬁcation models when switch-
ing devices or hardware (e.g., diﬀerent kinds of mouse or
screens).
The results obtained from our study are promising, how-
ever, we believe that further work is needed in order to im-
prove the overall accuracy of user identiﬁcation. One avenue
in this direction is to add a little more complexity to the
game challenges in order to increase the level of interaction
between the challenge and the user, and thereby improv-
ing the overall usability (False Negative Rate) and security
(False Positive Rate) of the interactive authentication.
8. RELATED WORK
The main aim of behavioral biometrics is to solve the prob-
lems associated with the traditional authentication systems,
such as password leakage or sharing, requirements for extra
hardware in case of traditional biometrics (for example, ﬁn-
gerprint readers or iris scanners). However, most of the pro-
posed behavioral biometrics suﬀers from various problems,
such as low-level of uniqueness among the users, which yields
to high acceptance rate of illegitimate users (high False Pos-
itive Rate). Moreover, some of the behavioral biometrics
require long interaction time to identify/recognize the users
(up to 20 minutes [5]), which would allow attackers to in-
teract with the system and may cause harm to the system
during that period of time without getting detected.
The most studied approaches for behavioral biometrics are
keystroke analysis and mouse dynamics. Keystroke biomet-
rics identiﬁes the user based on her typing characteristics.
The veriﬁcation is performed either based on static text (i.e.,
password) or random text (i.e., free text to continuously au-
thenticate the users [17]). The features that are mostly used
are the timing information of key down/hold/up events, time
between the release of a key and the pressing on the next key,
overall typing speed, and frequency of errors [36]. Mouse dy-
namics [35] is another most studied behavioral biometrics.
It is mostly used for continuous authentication by recording
the user interaction with the device transparently. The user
is authenticated based on the general movement, drag and
drop, stillness, point and click.
Other recent research studied user authentication based
on user’s cognitive abilities [1].
In this work, the authors
studied the ability of authenticating the users based on their
cognitive process captured by visual search, working mem-
ory and priming eﬀect on automatic processing. The game
they utilized to capture the users’ cognitive abilities pro-
vides a challenge-response task.
In each instance of the
challenge-response, the user is given a challenge, which is an
object. The user’s task is to drag the challenge object onto
the matching object inside the search set. After a valid drop,
the user then receives a gold coin as a reward and deposits
it in a bank. On a correct deposit, the user is challenged
with a new object and the game continues as before. From
the interaction with the challenges, the authors extracted
several features that captures the cognitive abilities of the
users, however, they did not look into the mouse dynamics
biometrics of the users. Although the proposed method can
authenticate the user with high accuracy 0-7.8% FNR and
0-2.3% FPR, the veriﬁcation time and the enrollment time is
much longer than our Gametrics system. They require 76.7
seconds – 2.5 minutes for veriﬁcation and 9.8 min – 24.3 min
for enrollment.
The authors in [5] proposed a method to solve account
hijacking and share problems in an online gaming environ-
ment. They propose identifying the user based on her game-
play activities. They show that the idle time distribution
is a representative feature of game players. They propose
the relative entropy test RET scheme, which is based on
the Kullback-Leibler divergence between idle time (i.e., the
idle periods between successive moves of a player controlled
character) distributions, for user identiﬁcation. Their eval-
uations shows that the RET scheme achieves higher than
90% accuracy with a 20-minute detection time given a 200-
minute history size. Their detection time is much higher
than that in our Gametrics system.
9. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we introduced Gametrics, an interactive bio-
metrics system based on the gameplay pattern of the users
embedded in very simple game constructs. We showed that
incorporating the mouse dynamics with the cognitive mech-
anisms can identify the users with high accuracy within a
short period of time. Moreover, Gametrics provides secu-
rity against multiple forms of vulnerabilities ranging from
zero-eﬀort attacks to expert attacks who try to mimic the
user, even those who hack authentication templates and em-
ploy automated mechanisms such as robots and malware.
The time taken for enrollment and authentication are both
reasonably short. The system seems to provide good user
experience as reﬂected in the participants’ responses to the
survey.
