Since #1987, our SxS manifest is auto-generated, so it's certainly possible to
run the terminal unpackaged again. However, we need the `resources.pri` that's
only generated by building the CascadiaPackage project. Ideally, we'd be able
to rebuild the terminal code (with `bx`, #2168), and launch it using
`openterm`. We need to figure out a way to get openterm to build the appx's
resources.pri for us, and not re-build every time `openterm` is called.
