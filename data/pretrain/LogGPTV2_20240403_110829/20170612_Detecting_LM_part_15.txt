### Permissions Configuration

The following permissions are set in this configuration. Note that while recording file reads can enable a more detailed investigation, it is excluded to prevent an excessive increase in log volume.

- **Create files / write data**
- **Create folders / append data**
- **Write attributes**
- **Write extended attributes**
- **Delete subfolders and files**
- **Delete**
- **Change permissions**

When configuring the above settings, you may encounter numerous errors. In such cases, select "Continue."

### Appendix B: Log Descriptions
