Methodology, Etiquette and 
Rules of the Road
Scientific Method
1. Ask a question
2. Do background research
3. Construct a hypothesis
4. Test your hypothesis by 
doing an experiment
5. Analyze your data and 
draw a conclusion
6. Report your results (Was 
you hypothesis correct?)

Rigor and Merit
(NSF Review Criteria)
Intellectual Merit
– How important is the 
activity to advancing 
knowledge and 
understanding?
– How qualified is the 
proposer?
– Does the project explore 
creative, original or 
transformative concepts? 
– How well conceived and 
organized is the project?
– Is there sufficient access 
to resources?
Broader Impacts
– Does the activity advance 
discovery and 
understanding?
– While promoting teaching, 
training, and learning?
– Include participation by 
underrepresented groups?
– Will the results be 
disseminated broadly?
– What are the benefits to 
society?

TUSKEGEE SYPHILIS STUDY (1932-1972)
•
US Public Health Service research
•
600 low-income African-American males 
from rural Alabama with a high incidence of 
syphilis infection, were monitored for 40 
years. 
•
Subjects were given free medical 
examinations, but they were not told about 
their disease. 
•
Even though a proven cure (penicillin) 
became available in the 1950s, the study 
continued until 1972 with participants and 
their families being denied treatment.
•
In some cases, when subjects were 
diagnosed as having syphilis by other 
physicians, researchers intervened to 
prevent treatment. 
•
The study was stopped in 1973 by the U.S. 
Department of Health, Education, and 
Welfare only after its existence was 
exposed in a newspaper story, and it 
became a political embarrassment.
•
In 1997, President Clinton apologized to 
the study subjects and their families.
http://www.iupui.edu/~histwhs/G504.dir/irbhist.html
• Approves, monitors and reviews research 
involving human subjects.
• Response to research abuses in the 20th
century, including Nazi experimentation and 
the Tuskegee Syphilis Study.
• If you are dealing with human subjects, 
you may need IRB approval.

Responsible Disclosure
• Admittedly a 
Holy war
• How long to 
wait before 
disclosing a 
vulnerability
• Social 
responsibility 
vs. false 
security

Keep your Personal Research 
Distinct from Work
• Use your own time, 
hardware, software
• Read your employment 
contract carefully and any 
NDAs carefully
• Don’t let your personal 
work touch your 
employers resources.
• Smart employers/schools 
will respect your personal 
IP
http://source.nycsca.org/pdf/it/ITF-1a.pdf
Misc
•
No dual submissions
•
Academic conferences probably don’t pay travel or an honorarium 
for speakers/panelists
•
Avoid asking people out of the blue to read your paper/article, a 
thoughtful question or two is much better
•
Authors are typically sequenced from first author (biggest 
contribution) to Nth author (least contribution)
•
“Authors” don’t need to write a word
•
Sole author
•
When in doubt, acknowledge or cite
•
People get weird when you write up their “ideas” or work
•
With some research, discretion is advised
– Even when drunk
– Especially when the research is someone else’s 
A bit about Academia…
Academia is a Lot Like RE/MAX
Academia and Industry
• Follow the money
– Research grants
– Fads
– Customers with money
• Industry
– Must make case for 
bottom line
• Your advantages
– Passion
Academia
•
Academic Rank
–
Instructor
–
Assistant Professor
–
Associate Professor
•
Tenure usually starts here
–
Professor
•
Ranking of school != ranking of a 
given program
•
Time
–
BS, 4 years
–
MS, 1-2 years
•
Usually requires BS, but I’ve 
seen exceptions
–
PhD, 4-7 years
•
Can pick up MS along the way
•

Write Up Your Ideas
• Puts a timestamp on your work
• Helps make sure your work is known
• Strunk and White
– Omit Unnecessary Words
• Magazine / journal articles
– You don’t have to publish
– Read authors’ guidelines
– Doesn’t hurt if you already subscribe
• It is all about good fit
Publication
• Getting published is not a problem.
• Getting published in the right place 
is the goal.
• One good paper is better than several 
fluffy ones.
Rooter:  A Methodology for the Typical Unification of 
Access Points and Redundancy
Jeremy Stribling, Daniel Aguayo and Maxwell Krohn
Accepted at WMSCI 2005
Many physicists would agree that, had it not 
been for congestion control, the evaluation of 
web browsers might never have occurred. In 
fact, few hackers worldwide would disagree with 
the essential unification of voice-over-IP and 
public-private key pair. In order to solve this 
riddle, we confirm that SMPs can be made 
stochastic, cacheable, and interposable.

Dear XXX,
I am writing on behalf of the German publishing house, VDM Verlag Dr.
Müller AG & Co. KG. In the course of a research on the Internet, I came across 
a reference to your thesis on “YYY".
We are a German-based publisher whose aim is to make academic research 
available to a wider audience.
VDM Verlag would be especially interested in publishing your dissertation in the 
form of a printed book.
Your reply including an e-mail address to which I can send an e-mail with 
further information in an attachment will be greatly appreciated.
I am looking forward to hearing from you.
