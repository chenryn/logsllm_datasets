User: i have a fastq file with more than 100 million reads in it and a genome sequence of 10000 in length
i want to take out the sequences from the fastq file and search in the genome sequence with allowing 3 mismatches
I tried in this way using awk i got the sequences from fastq file:
1.fq(few lines)

$ awk 'NR%4==2' 1.fq

i have all the sequences in file,now i want to take each line of sequence and search in genome sequence with allowing 3 mismatches and if it finds print the sequences
example:
genome sequence file:

GGGGAGGAATATGATTTACAGTTTATTTTTCAACTGTGCAAAATAACCTTAACTGCAGACGTTATGACATACATACATTCTATGAATTCCACTATTTTGGAGGACTGGAATTTTGGTCTACAACCTCCCCCAGGAGGCACACTAGAAGATACTTATAGGTTTGTAACCCAGGCAATTGCTTGTCAAAAACATACA

search sequence file:

GGGGAGGAATATGAT
GGGGAGGAATATGAA
GGGGAGGAATATGCC
TCAAAAACATAGG
TCAAAAACATGGG 

OUTPUT FILE:

GGGGAGGAATATGAT 0 # 0 mismatch exact sequence
GGGGAGGAATATGAA 1 # 1 mismatch
GGGGAGGAATATGCC 2 # 2 mismatch
TCAAAAACATAGG   2 # 2 mismatch
TCAAAAACATGGG   3 # 3 mismatch
Assistant: I think you should consider using an alignment tool designed for this data for a couple of reasons:

Those tools will also find reverse complemented matches (though, you could also implement this).
Aligners will properly handle paired-end reads and multiple matches.
Most aligners are written in C and use data structures and algorithms designed for this amount of data.

For those reasons, and others, any script you come up with will likely not be near as fast and complete as the tools that already exist. If you want to specify the number of mismatches to keep, instead of aligning all your reads and then parsing the output, you could use Vmatch if you have access to it (this tool is very fast and good for many matching tasks).
