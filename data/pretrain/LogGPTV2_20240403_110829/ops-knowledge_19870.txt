User: How to solve the deadlock problem of MySQL database in high concurrency scenarios?
Assistant: The following are some common methods to solve the deadlock problem of MySQL database under high concurrency: 1. Optimize SQL statements to reduce unnecessary locking behavior. When writing SQL statements, avoid locking too many rows in one transaction. 2. Reduce the duration of the transaction. In order to reduce locking behavior and the occurrence of deadlocks, it is recommended to keep the duration of the transaction as short as possible. 3. Control concurrency, adopt technologies such as distributed transactions, sub-database and sub-table, etc., to reduce the load of a single node. 4. The order of locking, to avoid different transactions locking tables in different orders, resulting in deadlocks. 5. Use the InnoDB engine that comes with MySQL, and enable appropriate parameter configuration. For example, increase the cache area of InnoDB, modify the lock waiting time, etc. 6. Use the transaction isolation level of MySQL to set it. By setting different transaction isolation levels, on the premise of taking data consistency into account, the locking burden of the database is reduced. 7. Use MySQL's pessimistic lock and optimistic lock according to the actual situation. The use of pessimistic and optimistic locking depends on the specific situation and operation of the application. In short, in high concurrency scenarios, MySQL database deadlock is inevitable. But through some of the above methods, the occurrence of MySQL deadlocks can be reduced. At the same time, in the development process, according to different specific situations, it is necessary to combine the characteristics of the database and concentrate on optimizing.
