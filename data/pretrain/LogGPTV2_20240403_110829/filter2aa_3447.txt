Introduction
ESET research team published a paper titled "Operation Windigo", detailing how thousands 
of Linux and Unix servers were compromised, and used to steal SSH credentials, and 
redirect web visitors to malicious content and send spam.
Provide an overview of this campaign, and the three main malicious components of this 
operation:
 Linux/Ebury – an OpenSSH backdoor used to keep control of the servers and steal 
credentials
 Linux/Cdorked – an HTTP backdoor used to redirect web traffic
 Perl/Calfbot – a Perl script used to send spam

Introduction
The objective of this campaign is to gain monetary rewards. 
It is done via the followings ways:
 Spam
 User’s infection via drive-by downloads
 Redirection of web traffic to advertisement networks

 September 2013 : ESET captures network traffic from a server infected by 
Linux/Ebury running a reverse proxy service used as a target for Linux/Cdorked
redirections, revealing over 1,000,000 web redirections in 48 hours.
 October 2013: ESET captures 72 hours of network traffic revealing more than 
12,000 servers infected with Linux/Ebury.
 January 2014: ESET captures network traffic during three distinct 24-hour 
periods from a server running both a Linux/Ebury exfiltration service and a 
Perl/Calfbot command and control reverse proxy, revealing an average of 35 
million spam messages sent daily.
High Level Operation

High Level Operation
Several piece of malware used in the campaign:
 Linux/Ebury runs mostly on Linux servers. It provides a root backdoor shell and has the 
ability to steal SSH credentials.
 Linux/Cdorked runs mostly on Linux web servers. It provides a backdoor shell and 
distributes Windows malware to end users via drive-by downloads.
 Perl/Calfbot runs on most Perl supported platforms. It is a lightweight spam bot written 
in Perl.
 Win32/Boaxxe.G, a click fraud malware, and Win32/Glupteba.M, a generic proxy, run on 
Windows computers. These are the two threats distributed via drive-by download.

Relationship of Malware Components 
vs Activity/Service
10
High Level Operation
Sheer number of infected servers supporting the malicious activities
Two type of victims:
 Windows end-users visiting legitimate web sites hosted on compromised servers
 Linux/Unix servers operators whom servers were compromised
The malicious actors using these compromised servers to run one or more malicious 
services necessary for managing their whole operation
11
Credentials Stealing
12
Credentials Stealing
Two scenarios SSH credentials are stolen:
 Successful logon of a user on a infected server
 User logon to another system using a compromised server
Linux/Ebury backdoor is use for stealing credential
Backbone of the Windigo operation
13
Credentials Stealing
 Credentials intercepted by Linux/Ebury send to exfiltration servers via custom DNS 
queries
 Used to further spread infection 
 Criminal gang appear to have good operational security
 Never directly connect to any compromised server
 Used anonymizing tunnel on another compromised server
 Fetch stolen credentials stored on various infected servers

Web Traffic Redirection
18
Web Traffic Redirection
Infected web servers with Linux/Cdorked redirect users to exploit kit servers, which in turn 
attempt to infect users with malware.
This malicious action follows the below steps:
1.
Victim visits a legitimate website, which is a Linux/Cdorked infected server. Victim is 
being redirected to a specially crafted subdomain of a legitimate domain name.
2.
The nameserver of the legitimate domain, infected with another component of the 
Windigo operation named Linux/Onimiki, returns an IP address encoded in the 
subdomain. Thus, it allows the Windigo operation to make use of legitimate 
nameservers, making network-based detection harder.
3.
Reverse proxy servers on exploit serving machines are used to exploit victims, if 
successful, deliver malicious payload to victims; failing which, victims are redirected to 
advertisements.
19
Stolen SSH Passwords
 Monitored data sent to exfiltration servers
 5,362 unique successful logins from 2,840 different IP address
 No surprise a large number of root credentials are stolen, as malware must be 
installed as root.
 The higher number of root passwords, result in higher number of infections
 Vicious cycle resulting in greater chances of stealing other root credentials
20
Statistics SSH Passwords
Statistics SSH Passwords
 Average length of password is 11.09 characters, much longer than the 7.63 average 
discovered in LulzSec leak in 2011
 Shows that system administrators are more conscious on importance of strong password
 Passwords are well chosen, and generally do not contain repeating patterns
 33% of passwords contain at least one special character and average length of 11 
characters.
 This is generally secure against brute force attempts
22
Spam Analysis
One way the Windigo operators are monetizing through this campaign is by sending spam 
email.
Two methods are used:
 Servers infected with Perl/Calfbot
 End-user workstations infected with Win32/Glupteba.M
We used two approaches to understand the volume and type of spam send via the 
Perl/Calfbot infrastructure, namely: 
 Fake Bot
 C&C Traffic Analysis
23
Fake Bot
 Analysis period from August 2013 to February 2014
 A fake client is used to fetch spam jobs from C&C server
 Spam jobs consists of multiple email templates and list of recipient email addresses
 Fake Bot retrieved 13,422 different spam jobs targeting 20,683,814 unique email 
addresses

C&C Traffic Analysis
Analysed network traffic captured on 1 C&C servers over 24-hour period over 3 weeks for the month of January 2014
Infected servers reported daily average of 35 million successful spam messages
26
Redirected End Users
 Through analysis of network traffic captured from a reverse proxy, we observed more than 1.1 
million different IP addresses going through this server, and being redirected to exploit kit servers.
 When a user's computer is redirected to a front-end reverse proxy, it starts a series of back-and-
forth communications with the exploit kit server. In the end, user's computer may be infected with 
malware if it is vulnerable to the exploit
 The Blackhole kit was used by Windigo operators here, targeting Windows users. In October 2013, 
the operators switched to Neutrino exploit kit, after the arrest of alleged Blackhole author. In March 
2014, we observed the use of Flashback
 Two distinct malware families were distributed by the exploit kit. Specifically from USA, UK, Canada 
and Australia were infected with Win32/Boaxxe.G, whereas others were infected with 
Win32/Leechole,a dropper which then installed Win32/Glupteba.M

NOT the end……
 The purpose of the operation seems to be monetary profit. This profit is gathered through 
various ways including redirecting web users to malicious content and sending unsolicited 
emails.
 From this presentation, we hope to reach out to the general public, the researcher 
community and system administrators who had the responsibility of managing of servers 
on the Internet. 
 One message we would like reader/audiences to take away is that:
Password-based login to servers should be a thing of the past. 
One should seriously consider two-factor authentication or, at least, a safe use of SSH keys.
