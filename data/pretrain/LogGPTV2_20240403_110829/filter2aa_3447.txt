### Introduction
The ESET research team published a paper titled "Operation Windigo," which details how thousands of Linux and Unix servers were compromised to steal SSH credentials, redirect web traffic to malicious content, and send spam. This document provides an overview of the campaign and its three main malicious components:

1. **Linux/Ebury**: An OpenSSH backdoor used to maintain control over the servers and steal credentials.
2. **Linux/Cdorked**: An HTTP backdoor used to redirect web traffic.
3. **Perl/Calfbot**: A Perl script used to send spam.

### Campaign Objective
The primary objective of this campaign is to generate monetary rewards through:
- Spam
- User infections via drive-by downloads
- Redirection of web traffic to advertisement networks

### Timeline
- **September 2013**: ESET captures network traffic from a server infected with Linux/Ebury, revealing over 1,000,000 web redirections in 48 hours.
- **October 2013**: ESET captures 72 hours of network traffic, revealing more than 12,000 servers infected with Linux/Ebury.
- **January 2014**: ESET captures network traffic over three distinct 24-hour periods from a server running both a Linux/Ebury exfiltration service and a Perl/Calfbot command and control reverse proxy, revealing an average of 35 million spam messages sent daily.

### High-Level Operation
Several pieces of malware were used in the campaign:
- **Linux/Ebury**: Primarily runs on Linux servers, providing a root backdoor shell and the ability to steal SSH credentials.
- **Linux/Cdorked**: Primarily runs on Linux web servers, providing a backdoor shell and distributing Windows malware to end users via drive-by downloads.
- **Perl/Calfbot**: Runs on most Perl-supported platforms and is a lightweight spam bot written in Perl.
- **Win32/Boaxxe.G**: A click fraud malware.
- **Win32/Glupteba.M**: A generic proxy. Both these threats are distributed via drive-by download.

### Relationship of Malware Components vs. Activity/Service
- **Victims**: 
  - Windows end-users visiting legitimate websites hosted on compromised servers.
  - Linux/Unix server operators whose servers were compromised.
- **Malicious Actors**: Use these compromised servers to run one or more malicious services necessary for managing their entire operation.

### Credentials Stealing
- **Scenarios for SSH Credential Theft**:
  - Successful logon of a user on an infected server.
  - User logon to another system using a compromised server.
- **Backbone of the Windigo Operation**: The Linux/Ebury backdoor is used to steal credentials.
- **Exfiltration Process**:
  - Stolen credentials are sent to exfiltration servers via custom DNS queries.
  - Used to further spread the infection.
  - The criminal gang appears to have good operational security, never directly connecting to any compromised server and using anonymizing tunnels on other compromised servers to fetch stolen credentials.

### Infection Scenarios
- **Top 5 Infected Countries**: [Details to be provided]

### Web Traffic Redirection
- **Process**:
  1. Victim visits a legitimate website, which is a Linux/Cdorked-infected server. The victim is redirected to a specially crafted subdomain of a legitimate domain name.
  2. The nameserver of the legitimate domain, infected with another component of the Windigo operation named Linux/Onimiki, returns an IP address encoded in the subdomain. This allows the Windigo operation to use legitimate nameservers, making network-based detection harder.
  3. Reverse proxy servers on exploit-serving machines attempt to exploit victims. If successful, they deliver a malicious payload; if not, victims are redirected to advertisements.

### Stolen SSH Passwords
- **Monitored Data Sent to Exfiltration Servers**:
  - 5,362 unique successful logins from 2,840 different IP addresses.
  - A large number of root credentials were stolen, as the malware must be installed as root.
  - The higher number of root passwords results in a greater number of infections, creating a vicious cycle that increases the chances of stealing other root credentials.

### Statistics SSH Passwords
- **Average Length of Passwords**: 11.09 characters, much longer than the 7.63 average discovered in the LulzSec leak in 2011.
- **Password Characteristics**:
  - System administrators are more conscious of the importance of strong passwords.
  - Passwords are well-chosen and generally do not contain repeating patterns.
  - 33% of passwords contain at least one special character and have an average length of 11 characters, making them generally secure against brute force attempts.

### Spam Analysis
- **Monetization Methods**:
  - Servers infected with Perl/Calfbot.
  - End-user workstations infected with Win32/Glupteba.M.
- **Approaches to Understand Spam Volume and Type**:
  - **Fake Bot**: Analysis period from August 2013 to February 2014. A fake client was used to fetch spam jobs from C&C servers, retrieving 13,422 different spam jobs targeting 20,683,814 unique email addresses.
  - **C&C Traffic Analysis**: Network traffic captured on one C&C server over 24-hour periods over three weeks in January 2014, revealing an average of 35 million successful spam messages sent daily.

### Redirected End Users
- **Analysis of Network Traffic**:
  - Over 1.1 million different IP addresses were observed being redirected to exploit kit servers.
  - The Blackhole kit was initially used, but after the arrest of the alleged Blackhole author, the operators switched to the Neutrino exploit kit in October 2013. In March 2014, the Flashback exploit kit was observed.
  - Two distinct malware families were distributed: Win32/Boaxxe.G (targeting USA, UK, Canada, and Australia) and Win32/Leechole (a dropper that installs Win32/Glupteba.M).

### Conclusion
- **Purpose of the Operation**: Monetary profit, gathered through various means including redirecting web users to malicious content and sending unsolicited emails.
- **Key Message**:
  - Password-based login to servers should be a thing of the past.
  - Consider two-factor authentication or, at least, a safe use of SSH keys.
