User: I would appreciate it if somebody running the final version of Snow Leopard could post what version of Python is included with the OS (on a Terminal, just type "python --version")
Thanks!
Assistant: It ships with both python 2.6.1 and 2.5.4.

$ python2.5
Python 2.5.4 (r254:67916, Jul  7 2009, 23:51:24)
$ python
Python 2.6.1 (r261:67515, Jul  7 2009, 23:51:51)
