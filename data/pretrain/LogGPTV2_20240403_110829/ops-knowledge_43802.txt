User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Apache2 configtest segmentation fault For whatever reason I managed to mess up Apache quite bad (Ubuntu 12.04). The output below complains about configtest failing and a segmentation fault. However, I can't find anything in /var/log/apache2/error.log. How can I debug this "configtest"?

jeroen@jeroen-ubuntu:~$ sudo service apache2 stop
 * Stopping web server apache2                                                  
 * The apache2 configtest failed, so we are trying to kill it manually. This is almost certainly suboptimal, so please make sure your system is working as you'd expect now!
 ... waiting                                                             [ OK ]
jeroen@jeroen-ubuntu:~$ sudo service apache2 start
 * Starting web server apache2
Segmentation fault
Action 'start' failed.
The Apache error log may have more information.

Edit: the problem is related to the loading of an apache2 module. I found some traces of the problem in/var/log/kern.log:

I have been using this module for years and it has always been stable. I have recently been installing some backports from PPA repositories, I suspect that one of these packages has broken my system...

Assistant: If configtest failed that is not anything to panic about. It basically means something is screwy in one of your Apache config files.  So this is my punch down list of what you should do:


Were you editing an Apache config file before this happened?  Which one? Where?  Can you restore a backup or a known good config for it? Basically, I would go over the config with a fine-tooth comb.  Something as simple as misspelling in a config option can be the cause. Or maybe the file is damaged?
Was this on a main config like /etc/apache2/apache2.conf or something in /etc/apache2/sites-enabled? If it was in the main config file, it would show up in the error.log more often than not? If not, maybe in a separate log connected to your virtual hosts?
What is your virtual host config like when you run sudo apachectl -S?  That might give another clue as to what configs Apache is using.
Past any of that, did you add—or attempt to add—any modules to Apache?  Can you disable them? You indicate in some of your comment answers that the module might be the cause.  Don’t be married to a piece of replaceable software.  Just delete it &amp; reinstall the module.  Could be corrupt.
Absolute worst case scenario, unless you have an incredibly idiosyncratic install of Apache—I would recommend backing up your configs in /etc/apache2—removing Apache from your system and reinstall it clean.  Then see if that clean install works &amp; if it does, then redo your configuration based on the backup files.
