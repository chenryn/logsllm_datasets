munication with participants was in English, and their in-
puts were also required to be in English. Participants were
required to be 18 years of age to participate.
Each participant was ﬁrst shown the Information Sheet
explaining the purpose of the study. Following this she regis-
tered in one of three ways, depending on the speciﬁc study’s
design: by entering her MTurk ID, or her E-mail address
or the system assigned her a random identiﬁer. A partici-
pant then input her demographic information (age, gender,
and native language) and proceeded with the study. In this
paper we report on the two culminating studies, which we
used to evaluate LEP performance. We describe our study
design in this section and provide detailed results and their
interpretation in the next section.
Performance Study. This study was run in Fall 2015
and Spring 2016. It was designed to evaluate strength against
brute-force and statistical guessing attacks, memorability
and reuse of LEPs, and compare them to the same quali-
ties of ordinary, 3class8 [85] passwords. We recruited par-
ticipants from Amazon MTurk, and asked each to create
ten LEPs and ten ordinary passwords. This scenario is un-
natural, since no user would create so many passwords in
such a short time span in real life. However, asking for
ten passwords enabled us to study password reuse, because
we could measure how many among the ten (passwords or
118
LEPs) are similar or same.1 We asked participants to create
passwords (LEPs or 3class8 passwords) for the following ten
online sites and displayed their logos during creation and au-
thentication: Facebook, Google+, Gmail, Outlook, Bank of
America, Chase Bank, Target, WalMart, Wall Street Jour-
nal and CNN.
Asking users to create passwords for ﬁctional servers and
recall them later will necessarily underestimate recall in real
life, because user motivation to remember these passwords
is low. We believe that this confounding factor will have a
similar eﬀect on LEP recall as on password recall.
We required the ordinary passwords to follow 3class8 pol-
icy – being at least 8 characters long, and containing char-
acters from 3 out of 4 character classes: uppercase and low-
ercase letters, digits and special characters. Each LEP was
required to specify at least 5 facts. Users were asked to re-
turn for authentication after one week. We allowed three
authentication attempts per LEP or password. We paid $1
for the creation task, and $2 for the authentication task.
To minimize password reuse, we did not let participants
select a LEP topic from a list. Instead, we oﬀered a topic
for each LEP, which was randomly selected from our topic
list. A participant could reject the oﬀered topics, until she
ﬁnds the one that she wants to talk about.
At registration, each participant was randomly assigned
to either guided or to semi-guided input category. She then
created and authenticated with all 10 LEPs using the same
input method. The guided group was asked between 5 and
15 questions per LEP. The semi-guided group was asked to
specify two people, one location and two objects for each
LEP, and to specify a hint for each fact. After creating all
10 LEPs, each participant was asked to create 10 passwords,
for the same servers. Participants were reminded via E-
mail to return for authentication after one week. We also
invited them to return for authentication after 3–6 months
to measure long-term recall.
Friend Guessing Study. This study was run concur-
rently with our performance study, using the same system.
We recruited participants from our institution (University
of Southern California) to conduct an in-lab study, with the
goal to measure the strength of LEPs against a friend at-
tacker. In addition to personal knowledge, we encouraged
the guessers to fully utilize information available from var-
ious social network sites and search engines. We observed
that many participants in the study indeed made use of these
online information sources.
Participants were required to enroll into the study with
at least one other friend. We advertised the study via class
announcements, wall posters, and ﬂyers. Each participant
was paid $10, and took 45-60 minutes to complete the study.
Unlike our previous studies, this study used deception in
the Information Sheet (approved by our IRB), by not in-
forming the participants that they will be guessing each
others’ LEPs. This was necessary to prevent participants
from intentionally creating LEPs, which would be either too
easy or too hard for a given friend to guess. We designed our
study to mimic the real-life password use, where one does
1We initially attempted a phased study design, where a par-
ticipant created one password (LEP or 3class8) and returned
after one week to authenticate. After authentication the par-
ticipant created another password for the next cycle. How-
ever, we had to abandon this study idea due to high attrition
rates.
not know who may try to guess one’s password.
After reviewing the Information Sheet, each participant
was asked how close they were with their friend on the scale
from 1 to 5 (closest), and how long they knew each other.
Next, they were asked to create three LEPs for three diﬀer-
ent online accounts: Gmail, Facebook and Bank of Amer-
ica. We displayed corresponding logos during creation and
authentication. Each participant was randomly assigned to
either guided or semi-guided input method, and created all
LEPs using this method.
Next, participants were asked to authenticate with each
LEP, and were allowed unlimited number of trials, but re-
quired to make at least three. We incorporated user au-
thentication in the study to ensure that participants did not
make up answers they could not recall themselves.
After authentication, we debriefed each participant about
the deception and explained our reasons for this. We in-
formed them that their friend would be guessing their LEP
and vice versa. They were oﬀered a chance to quit the study
at this time, and still receive the full payment. No partici-
pants quit.
Next, each participant attempted to guess her friend’s
LEP’s, and was allowed unlimited number of trials, and
required to make at least three. Afterwards, we reviewed
successfully guessed answers with participants, asking them
about their strategy. We ended the study with a short survey
about usability of LEPs. Lastly, we asked the participants
not to disclose details about deception to other students on
campus, so we could continue recruitment.
Limitations and Ecological Validity. Our study had
the following limitations, many of which are common for on-
line password studies. First, it is possible but very unlikely
that a participant may enroll into our Performance study
more than once. While the same Mechanical Turk user (as
identiﬁed by her MTurkID) could not enter the study twice,
it is possible for someone to create multiple Mechanical Turk
accounts. There is currently no way to identify such partic-
ipants.
Second, we cannot be sure that our Performance study
participants did not write down or photograph their LEPs
or passwords. We can only claim that they had very low in-
centives to do so (since we promised payment regardless of
authentication success). Our study mechanisms further de-
tected copy/paste actions and we have excluded any partic-
ipant that used these (for whatever reason) from the study.
We also reminded the participants multiple times to rely on
their memory only.
If any cheating occurred it was likely
to aﬀect all the results equally, without bias to LEPs or
passwords.
Third, Mechanical Turkers may not be very motivated
or focused – this makes it likely that actual recall both of
real-world LEPs and of passwords would be higher. While
it would have been preferable to conduct our Performance
study in the lab, the cost would be too high (for us) to af-
ford as large a participation as we had through the use of
Mechanical Turkers. We believe that any eﬀect from partic-
ipant motivation on recall applies equally to LEPs and to
passwords.
Fourth, participants in our Friend Guessing study were all
recruited from our university and thus were not very close.
Best friends or family members may have higher success at
guessing LEPs. We plan to investigate this in our future
research.

5. STUDY RESULTS
In this Section, we report on the results of our two user
studies. We found that: (1) LEPs are 30–47 bits stronger
than an ideal, randomized, 8-character password, (2) LEPs
are 2–3× more memorable than passwords, (3) LEPs are
reused half as often as passwords, (4) LEPs are 24–35×
harder for friends to guess than security questions, (5) LEPs
contain 2.4–3.2× fewer fake answers than security questions.
5.1 Participant Statistics
Table 3 shows the breakdown of our participants in the
ﬁrst two rows. We show count of participants, who com-
pleted both password creation and authentication tasks, and
the total number of passwords. We also collected demo-
graphics, age and language of participants but found that
these factors did not have signiﬁcant impact on security,
memorability or password reuse. With regard to topics cho-
sen by participants, 55% of LEPs talk either about learning
(26%), people (18%) or trips (11%), while other topics were
less popular.
5.2 LEPs Are Memorable and Secure
In this section we report ﬁndings from our performance
study, described in Section 4.
Privacy risk. LEPs have more sensitive information
than passwords and, since their title and questions are dis-
played in clear, that may increase privacy risk to a user.
It is diﬃcult to accurately measure sensitivity of LEPs, as
it depends on a user’s subjective assessment how speciﬁc
information relates to her sense of privacy.
Instead, we
calculate how many LEPs contain information that most
people would ﬁnd sensitive, such as information about ill-
ness, incarceration, love aﬀairs (excluding those involving
boyfriend/girlfriend and spouse) and indecent or illegal ac-
tivities. Our result represents a lower bound on sensitive
information contained in our dataset. 29 out of 930 LEPs,
or 3%, contained sensitive information. Majority of these
were LEPs about the death topic, and the sensitive infor-
mation was divulged in the guided LEPs, because we asked
about the cause of death. Better question design can further
reduce this privacy risk.
Security. Table 3 shows the total number of LEPs, and
their average brute-force and statistical strength in the 3rd
and the 4th row. We also calculated the percentage of LEPs,
which have the higher strength than a random, 3class8 pass-
word. We denote this strength as S3c8. Almost all LEPs
(94–95%) exceed S3c8, with the average strength being at
least 30 bits higher. Statistical strength of LEPs is also
quite high – it is 30–47 bits higher than S3c8.
Short-term recall. We report the percentage of success-
ful authentications, after one week, in Table 3, in the rows
5–12 for LEPs and for passwords. For LEPs, in addition to
all-fact recall, we investigated three alternative authentica-
tion schemes – ﬁve-fact, four-fact and three-fact recall. In
these, the user must successfully recall 3, 4 or 5 facts, re-
spectively, and the statistical strength of the recalled facts
must exceed S3c8.
Authentication success after one week is shown in rows
5–8 of Table 3. Password recall in our study was 26% (oth-
ers have found 45–70% recall [85, 92, 93], but they asked
users to recall only one password after 2 days). Our ﬁndings
are consistent with psychological literature [64, 77], where
Ebbinghaus found that people retain only 25% of new infor-
mation they learned after six to seven days [77].
Imprecise matching greatly helps to increase LEP recall.
With exact matching, all-fact authentication would be 19%
for guided and 9.6% for semi-guided LEPs. With imprecise
matching, it is 31.6% and 45.7%.
LEP authentication success with all facts is 30–75% higher
than that for passwords. When we require fewer facts for
authentication the success rate increases signiﬁcantly. At
four facts, LEP success is 2.7× higher than password success
rate, and at three facts it is 3.2× higher. Allowing users
to authenticate with fewer than all facts lowers security of
LEPs. Since we also require that the statistical strength of
recalled facts exceeds S3c8, the remaining strength of these
“shortened LEPs” is suﬃciently large to thwart attacks. In
Section 5.3 we will investigate how requiring M < N facts
for authentication aﬀects strength against friend attacks.
Security questions have a wide range of recall rates after
one month – from 32.1% for frequent ﬂyer number to 83.9%
for city of birth [67]. LEP recall with four-fact and three-
fact authentication is 70–89.2% and thus resembles recall for
memorable security questions. If a LEP were equivalent to a
set containing several security questions, its best recall rate
would be 83.94 = 50% for four-fact and 83.93 = 59% for
three-fact authentication. The fact that LEP recall exceeds
these values shows the power of user-customized questions
and imprecise matching, over general questions and exact
matching.
To understand reasons for failures to recall a LEP we ex-
amine recall rate per fact category (as given in Table 1).
Table 4 shows the percentage of correctly recalled facts (in
at least one attempt) per fact category in column 2. Rela-
tionships and cities are most accurately recalled, followed by
items in the HU category, places, and ﬁrst and last names.
Overall, all categories except ACT have recall of more than
70% after one week. While this is quite high, it may be
puzzling why a user would fail to recall all facts correctly,
or at least at higher rates. We note some frequent reasons
for failed recall per category in column 3. Many of these
could be handled by better NLP techniques, e.g., using stem-
ming for verbs, trying synonyms during matching, building
a database of common abbreviations (e.g., gf for girlfriend),
etc. This would further improve recall, at some security
cost. We leave this direction for future work.

Table 4: Fact recall and guess success per category
Overall there were 18.2% of facts, which a user failed to
recall in any authentication attempt. Users provide fake
answers to security questions. They may also provide fake
answers to LEPs, that they could not later recall. While we
cannot accurately establish which facts are fake, and which
are not, we estimate incidence of lying by looking for facts,
which a user failed to recall, and where failure cannot be
attributed to the NLP reasons we listed in Table 4, i.e., it
