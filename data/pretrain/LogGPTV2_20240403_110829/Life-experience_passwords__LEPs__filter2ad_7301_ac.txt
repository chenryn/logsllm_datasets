### Communication and Registration
Communication with participants was conducted in English, and all inputs were required to be in English. Participants had to be at least 18 years old to participate.

Each participant was first shown an Information Sheet explaining the purpose of the study. They then registered in one of three ways, depending on the specific study design: by entering their MTurk ID, email address, or using a randomly assigned identifier. Participants then provided demographic information (age, gender, and native language) and proceeded with the study.

In this paper, we report on the two culminating studies used to evaluate LEP performance. We describe our study design in this section and provide detailed results and their interpretation in the next section.

### Performance Study
This study was conducted in Fall 2015 and Spring 2016. It aimed to evaluate the strength of LEPs against brute-force and statistical guessing attacks, as well as their memorability and reuse, and compare these qualities to those of ordinary 3class8 [85] passwords.

Participants were recruited from Amazon MTurk and asked to create ten LEPs and ten ordinary passwords. This scenario, while unnatural, allowed us to study password reuse by measuring how many of the ten passwords or LEPs were similar or identical. Participants created passwords for the following ten online sites, with their logos displayed during creation and authentication: Facebook, Google+, Gmail, Outlook, Bank of America, Chase Bank, Target, Walmart, Wall Street Journal, and CNN.

Creating passwords for fictional servers and recalling them later can underestimate real-life recall due to low user motivation. We believe this confounding factor will similarly affect LEP and password recall.

Ordinary passwords had to follow the 3class8 policy—being at least 8 characters long and containing characters from three out of four character classes: uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters. Each LEP had to specify at least five facts. Participants were asked to return for authentication after one week, with three authentication attempts allowed per LEP or password. Participants were paid $1 for the creation task and $2 for the authentication task.

To minimize password reuse, we did not allow participants to select LEP topics from a list. Instead, we offered a randomly selected topic from our list, which participants could reject until they found one they wanted to discuss.

At registration, each participant was randomly assigned to either guided or semi-guided input categories. The guided group was asked between 5 and 15 questions per LEP, while the semi-guided group specified two people, one location, and two objects for each LEP, along with a hint for each fact. After creating all 10 LEPs, participants created 10 passwords for the same servers. Participants were reminded via email to return for authentication after one week and were also invited to return for authentication after 3-6 months to measure long-term recall.

### Friend Guessing Study
This study was run concurrently with the performance study using the same system. Participants were recruited from the University of Southern California for an in-lab study to measure the strength of LEPs against friend attackers. Participants were encouraged to use personal knowledge and information from social networks and search engines.

Participants had to enroll with at least one other friend. The study was advertised through class announcements, wall posters, and flyers. Each participant was paid $10 and took 45-60 minutes to complete the study.

Unlike previous studies, this study used deception in the Information Sheet (approved by our IRB) by not informing participants that they would be guessing each other's LEPs. This was necessary to prevent intentional creation of LEPs that would be too easy or too hard to guess.

After reviewing the Information Sheet, participants rated their closeness to their friend on a scale from 1 to 5 and indicated how long they had known each other. They then created three LEPs for three different online accounts: Gmail, Facebook, and Bank of America. Logos were displayed during creation and authentication. Participants were randomly assigned to either guided or semi-guided input methods.

Participants authenticated with each LEP, with unlimited trials but at least three required. User authentication ensured participants did not make up answers they could not recall themselves. After authentication, participants were debriefed about the deception and given the option to quit the study and still receive full payment. No participants quit.

Participants then attempted to guess their friend's LEPs, with unlimited trials and at least three required. Successfully guessed answers were reviewed, and participants were asked about their strategy. The study ended with a short survey about LEP usability. Participants were asked not to disclose details about the deception to other students on campus to facilitate continued recruitment.

### Limitations and Ecological Validity
Our study had several limitations common to online password studies:
1. **Multiple Enrollments:** It is possible, though unlikely, that a participant might enroll more than once. While the same Mechanical Turk user (identified by their MTurkID) could not enter the study twice, it is possible for someone to create multiple Mechanical Turk accounts.
2. **Cheating:** We cannot be sure that participants did not write down or photograph their LEPs or passwords. However, they had very low incentives to do so, and our mechanisms detected and excluded any copy/paste actions. If cheating occurred, it likely affected all results equally.
3. **Motivation and Focus:** Mechanical Turkers may not be highly motivated or focused, which could result in lower recall rates. While in-lab studies would be preferable, the cost was prohibitive for the large sample size we achieved through Mechanical Turk.
4. **Friend Closeness:** Participants in the Friend Guessing study were recruited from our university and were not very close. Best friends or family members might have higher success at guessing LEPs, which we plan to investigate in future research.

### Study Results
In this section, we report the results of our two user studies. We found that:
1. LEPs are 30–47 bits stronger than an ideal, randomized, 8-character password.
2. LEPs are 2–3 times more memorable than passwords.
3. LEPs are reused half as often as passwords.
4. LEPs are 24–35 times harder for friends to guess than security questions.
5. LEPs contain 2.4–3.2 times fewer fake answers than security questions.

#### Participant Statistics
Table 3 shows the breakdown of our participants. We present the count of participants who completed both password creation and authentication tasks, along with the total number of passwords. Demographics, age, and language did not significantly impact security, memorability, or password reuse. Popular LEP topics included learning (26%), people (18%), and trips (11%).

#### LEPs Are Memorable and Secure
We report findings from our performance study described in Section 4.

**Privacy Risk:** LEPs contain more sensitive information than passwords, increasing privacy risk. We calculated the percentage of LEPs containing sensitive information such as illness, incarceration, love affairs, and indecent or illegal activities. Only 3% of LEPs contained sensitive information, primarily in death-related LEPs. Better question design can further reduce this risk.

**Security:** Table 3 shows the total number of LEPs and their average brute-force and statistical strength. Almost all LEPs (94–95%) exceed the strength of a random 3class8 password, with an average strength of at least 30 bits higher. Statistical strength is 30–47 bits higher.

**Short-term Recall:** Table 3 reports the percentage of successful authentications after one week. Password recall in our study was 26%, consistent with psychological literature. Imprecise matching greatly increased LEP recall. With exact matching, all-fact authentication was 19% for guided and 9.6% for semi-guided LEPs. With imprecise matching, it was 31.6% and 45.7%.

LEP authentication success with all facts is 30–75% higher than that for passwords. Requiring fewer facts for authentication significantly increases success rates. At four facts, LEP success is 2.7 times higher than password success, and at three facts, it is 3.2 times higher. Allowing fewer facts lowers security, but the remaining strength is sufficient to thwart attacks.

**Fact Recall and Guess Success:** Table 4 shows the percentage of correctly recalled facts per category. Relationships and cities were most accurately recalled, followed by items in the HU category, places, and first and last names. Common reasons for failed recall include misspellings, synonyms, and tense mismatches. Improved NLP techniques could further enhance recall, albeit at some security cost.

### Summary
Our studies demonstrate that LEPs are more secure and memorable than traditional passwords. They are less prone to reuse and harder for friends to guess. Future work will focus on improving NLP techniques and investigating the performance of LEPs with closer relationships.
