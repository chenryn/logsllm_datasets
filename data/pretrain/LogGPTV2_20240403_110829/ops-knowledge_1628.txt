User: Please provide a Nginx configuration file for reverse proxying web applications based on HTTPS protocol
Assistant: The following is an example Nginx configuration file for reverse proxying HTTPS-based web applications: ``` server { listen 443; server_name example.com; ssl on; ssl_certificate /path/to/ssl/cert.pem; ssl_certificate_key /path/to/ssl/private_key.pem; location / { proxy_pass https://localhost:8000; proxy_set_header Host $host; proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr; } } ``` In this configuration file, we specify Nginx listens on port 443, the default port for HTTPS. Next, we specified the path of the SSL certificate and private key used to encrypt the transmitted data. In the `location` block, we use the `proxy_pass` directive to forward the request to the local port 8000, which is the port where our web application is located. We also set some HTTP headers via the `proxy_set_header` directive so that our application can properly handle requests. Finally, remember to introduce this configuration file in the main configuration file of Nginx, so that Nginx can load it correctly: ``` http { # ... other configurations... include /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/*; } ```
