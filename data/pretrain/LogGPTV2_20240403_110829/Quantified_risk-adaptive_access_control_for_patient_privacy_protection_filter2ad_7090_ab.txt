determine which records are relevant to what purposes; (3) how to
compute a risk score based on the set of records a doctor accessed.
Labeling Medical Records and Access Requests Nowadays,
most hospitals categorize their patients’ records using certain di-
agnosis codes, such as ICD-9. We may use the diagnosis codes
as the labels of the medical records. Access requests may also be
labeled with diagnosis codes either manually or automatically. For
example, the system may automatically label a request based on the
doctor’s specializations or retro-label a request based on the patien-
t’s examination records.
Estimating Record Relevance An important step in our risk-
quantiﬁcation solution is to determine how different types of
records are related to various purposes. Recall that in Section 2,
we introduced a relevance-relation function θ, which returns the
degree of relevance between a medical record and a purpose. Un-
fortunately, the concrete form of the function θ is never known in
reality. In our solution, we approximate the function θ using the
access patterns of all doctors in the system. We argue that, most
of the time, doctors’ professional knowledge enables them to cor-
rectly select the information that is useful for their tasks. Given a
purpose ti, by observing the distribution of the labels of the medi-
cal records requested by doctors for ti, we may gain knowledge on
how different types of records are useful for ti.
Computing Risk Scores A doctor may need a combination of d-
ifferent types of records to serve a purpose. Also, the number of
records needed by a doctor for a purpose varies from case to case.
Rather than measuring the risk of each individual access, we treat
the set of requests a doctor made for the same purpose during a
period of time as a whole, and compute a risk score for such a set
of requests. The risk score depends on how well the combination
of requested records serve the doctor’s purpose. Note that a doctor
may serve multiple patients for the same purpose during the peri-
od of time. We aggregate different patients’ records accessed by
the doctor together in risk score computation; the aggregation over
multiple patients potentially reduces the effect of outliers.
We compare the combination of the labels of the records chosen
by the doctor with those chosen by all doctors in the knowledge
base. To quantify the result of the comparison, we use the concept
of Shannon entropy from information theory. Entropy is a measure
of the uncertainty associated with a random variable. Let Ti be the
set of purposes appearing in doctor ui’s access requests in the past
period. For each purpose tj 2 Ti, let S(ui, tj) be the sequence
of the labels of the records which ui requested for purpose tj in
the past period. Let fui (lk, tj) be the number of occurrences of
medical records with label lk 2 L in S(ui, tj). The probability
that a medical record with label lk is chosen by ui for purpose tj is
pui (lkjtj) = fui (lk, tj)/(cid:6)lb∈Lfui (lb, tj)
Let x be the random variable corresponding to the selection of med-
ical records. The uncertainty of the medical records selected by ui
for purpose tj is
Hui (tj, x) = (cid:0)
pui (lkjtj) ln pui (lkjtj)
|L|∑
k=1
Similarly, we may compute the corresponding uncertainty
Hall(tj, x) over all doctors’ medical record selection for purpose
tj in the current knowledge base. The risk associated with ui’s ac-
cess requests for purpose tj in the past period is computed as the
difference between the above two uncertainties:
R(ui, tj) = maxfHui (tj, x) (cid:0) Hall(tj, x), 0g
Note that the value of R(ui, tj) is non-negative. The intuition be-
hind the above risk computation is that: malicious doctors have
larger probability accessing records that are irrelevant to a given
purpose tj, which makes the labels of their medical records more
diverse than those in the general access patterns among all doctors.
A more diverse selection leads to higher uncertainty and thus larger
entropy, which leads to a higher risk score.
Advantages Our risk-quantiﬁcation approach has a number of ad-
vantages. First, our approach effectively enforces the principle of
need-to-know. In our solution, risk scores are affected by relevance
rather than the number or sensitivity of accessed records. Second,
our quantiﬁcation solution learns the relevance relation between
medical records and access purposes from all users in the system.
Third, we employ the concept of entropy from information theory
in risk quantiﬁcation, which provides a solid theoretical foundation
for our solution.
4. RISK-BASED ACCESS CONTROL
Risk scores are computed periodically for each doctor. At the
very beginning, we may grant each doctor a certain amount of ac-
cess quotas in the access control system. Every time after a risk
score is computed for a doctor, the corresponding amount of ac-
cess quotas are deducted from the doctor’s account. The doctor can
continue to access medical records if the amount of her remaining
quotas is larger than zero; otherwise, her further access requests
will be denied until she acquires more quotas.
408
A certain amount of new quotas are provided to each doctor pe-
riodically. The amount of granted quotas is supposed to be enough
for the doctor’s access requests during the period of time.
The
number of quotas granted to a doctor essentially speciﬁes a thresh-
old on the amount of risk the system can tolerate for the doctor over
the corresponding period of time. Existing work on risk-based ac-
cess control does not provide a concrete way on how to compute
the risk-tolerance thresholds.
In our system, we use a statistical
method to determine such thresholds.
Let dk be the kth quota-granting period. Mq(dk) is the to-
tal number of quotas spent in dk and Mu(dk) is the number of
doctors in dk. E(dk) = Mq(dk)/Mu(dk) is the average num-
ber of quotas per doctor that are spent in dk. Also, let L =
fE(dn−1), E(dn−2), . . . , E(dn−m)g be the sequence of average
spent quotas per doctor in the past m periods. Let µ and σ be the
mean and the standard deviation of elements in L, respectively. If
we assume that the number of quotas consumed by doctors in dif-
ferent periods of time follows the normal distribution, we may grant
new quotas based on µ and σ in such a way that the probability that
a doctor runs out of quotas in the next period of time is lower than
ξ, where ξ 2 [0, 1] serves as the risk-tolerance threshold. For ex-
ample, the chance that a doctor spends more than µ + 2σ quotas
is lower than 5%. Note that a more trustworthy doctor may have a
smaller ξ, which provides her with more quotas.
In case a doctor consumes all of her quotas before the next of-
fering, she may ask for more. If the doctor rarely asks for more
quotas in the past, we may consider that the doctor runs out of quo-
tas due to exceptional conditions. The system may automatically
grant the doctor more quotas so that the doctor can continue with
her job. However, if a doctor runs out of quotas frequently, she may
be over-accessing patients’ information, as her risk scores must be
oftentimes much higher than average.
5. EVALUATION
5.1 Experiment Settings
In our experiments, we simulate the access requests from the t-
wo types of doctors deﬁned in Deﬁnition 1. We then compare the
average risk scores of the two types of doctors. Also, we check
whether most of the doctors with the highest risk scores are mali-
cious as well as whether most malicious doctors have the highest
risk scores. Our experiments are based on the real-world medical
history records provided by our hospital partners. Our dataset con-
tains 2.9 million event entries from 75307 patients.
In each simulation, a certain percentage of doctors are chosen to
be honest while the remaining doctors are set to be malicious. For
each event entry in the dataset, a sequence of access requests are
generated on behalf of the doctor in the corresponding event entry.
Each generated access request consists of a purpose and a target
label. For each access request generated, the purpose of the request
is the ICD-9 code of the corresponding event entry. The target label
represents the label of the medical record that the doctor asks for.
Let ci be the diagnosis code of the current event entry. Also, let C 1
i
and C 2
i be the main category and the sub-category of ci in ICD-9,
respectively. We have ci 2 C 2
i (cid:18) C 1
i (cid:26) C, where C
is the set of all main categories in ICD-9.
i , and C 1
i , C 2
i (cid:0) C 2
In our experiments, the codes in C 2
i are more likely to be related
to ci than those in C 1
i , which are in turn more likely to be
related to ci than those in C (cid:0) C 1
i . For an honest doctor, with prob-
ability 68% (i.e. the probability that a value falls in one standard
deviation from the mean in a normal distribution), the target label of
the access request is in C 2
i . This simulates access to most relevant
information. With probability 95% (i.e. the probability that a value
falls in two standard deviations from the mean in a normal distribu-

tion), the target label of the access request is in C 1
i . This simulates
access to somewhat relevant information. With probability 5%, the
target label is randomly selected from all the diagnosis codes we
have seen for the current patient in his/her past event entries. This
simulates access requests made by mistake or due to exception. As
to a malicious doctor, there is a probability ϵ2 that the target label of
a request is randomly selected (simulates over-accessing patient’s
information), and there is a probability (1 (cid:0) ϵ2) that the selection
of target label follows the above process we described for honest
doctors. The parameter ϵ2 is called the over-accessing probability.
In a simulation, the generated requests are divided into training
cases and test cases. Training cases are used to create the initial
knowledge base of the relevance relation between record labels and
access purposes. As to the test cases, we compute a risk score for
each doctor according to his/her access requests periodically.
