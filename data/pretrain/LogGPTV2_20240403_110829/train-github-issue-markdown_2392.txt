    AttributeError: module 'OpenSSL.SSL' has no attribute 'SSLv3_METHOD'
I suspect this error is because PyOpenSSL pushed a new release that pins to
`cryptography>=38.0.0,38` removes this error entirely.
### Steps to Reproduce
  1. Install scrapy == 2.6.2 on fresh virtualenv
  2. Run scrapy
  3. See error
  4. Downgrade cryptography<38
  5. Error goes.
**Expected behavior:** [What you expect to happen]
**Actual behavior:** [What actually happens]
**Reproduces how often:** [What percentage of the time does it reproduce?]
