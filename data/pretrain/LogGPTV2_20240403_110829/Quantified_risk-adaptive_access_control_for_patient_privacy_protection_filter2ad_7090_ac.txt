Finally, we deﬁne the criteria used in our evaluation. In each
simulation, we compute the average risk score among the honest
doctors and the average score among the malicious doctors. If our
risk-quantiﬁcation scheme is effective, the former should be much
smaller than the latter. In addition to the difference on risk scores,
we would also like to know, among the users with the highest risk
scores, how many of them are malicious doctors. The precision@k
of a result is the percentage of malicious doctors among the top k
users; the recall@k is the percentage of malicious doctors that are
among the top k users. We use F1 scores, which is the harmonic
mean of precision and recall, to measure the overall performance
among different values of k.
5.2 Experimental Results
Number of requests The ﬁrst set of experiments are designed to
test the effectiveness of our solution over different expected num-
bers of access requests per event entry. In each experiment, there
are 542 doctors, 10% (i.e. 54) of who are malicious while the other-
s are honest. The over-accessing probability of a malicious doctor
is 5%. The experimental results are given in Figure 1.
The results show that our risk-quantiﬁcation method is effective
for different expected numbers of requests per event entry. The av-
erage risk scores of malicious doctors are 6 to 12 times as high as
those of honest doctors. As to precision, in all cases, the top 10
users with the highest risk scores are all malicious doctors. Fur-
thermore, the precision among the top 50 users is always higher
than 70%. As to recall, when the expected number of requests is 10
or higher, at least 70% of the 54 malicious doctors are among the
top 50 users with the highest risk scores. The overall performance
(measured by F1 scores) of our approach increases when the ex-

pected number of requests increases from 5 to 10. More access
requests gives the system more opportunities to learn about the be-
havior of a doctor. However, further increasing the expected value
does not have much effect on the performance. This indicates that
our solution can reach close-to-maximum performance even with a
relatively small number (say, 10) of requests per event entry.
Probability of over-accessing The second set of experiments are
designed to test the effectiveness over different expected percent-
age of over-accessing activities performed by malicious doctors. In
each experiment, there are 542 doctors, 10% (i.e. 54) of who are
malicious. The excepted number of requests per event entry is 10.
The experimental results are presented in Figure 2.
The results show that our method is effective for different over-
accessing probabilities. The risk scores of malicious doctors are
3.5 to 20 times as high as those of honest doctors. The perfor-
mance of our solution increases as the over-accessing probability
increases. The reason is that more over-accessing activities makes
a malicious doctor’s access requests more diverse, which increases
the entropy of his activities and thus his risk scores. In particular,
our risk-quantiﬁcation method performs very well even when the
over-accessing probability is as small as 6%. When the probability
is 6% or higher, the precision@50 is at least 90% and the recal-
l@50 is at least 83%. Identifying malicious doctors becomes more
challenging when their over-accessing probability gets very small,
say, 2%. When the over-accessing probability is very small, some
honest users, who happen to have a relatively large number of ex-
ceptional access requests on irrelevant records, may end up having
higher risk scores than certain malicious doctors. At 2%, our so-
lution’s precision@50 and recall@50 are around 0.5. Considering
that the number of honest doctors is 9 times as great as that of mali-
cious doctors (488 v.s. 54), the result still shows that the likelihood
that a malicious doctor has a high risk score is signiﬁcantly larger
than that of an honest doctor.

Number of malicious doctors This set of experiments are de-
signed to test the effectiveness with different number of malicious
doctors in the system. In each experiment, there are 542 doctors, a
certain percentage of who are malicious. The excepted number of
requests per event entry is 10, and the over-accessing probability
of a malicious doctor is 5%. The experimental results are listed in
Table 1. The results show that our method is effective in all cases
with different numbers of malicious doctors. The risk scores of ma-
licious doctors are 7 to 12 times as high as those of honest doctors.
In order to compare the effectiveness with different percentage of
malicious doctors, we compute precision, recall, and F1 score@x,
where x is the number of malicious doctors in the system. It can
be easily proved that the three measures have the same value in this
case. The performance of our solution increases when the number
of malicious doctors increases. An explanation is that: a malicious
doctor’s expected value of risk score is higher than that of an honest
doctor. When the total number of doctors is the same, having more
malicious doctors indicates that there are less honest doctors, which
reduces the expected number of honest doctors who get higher risk
scores than some malicious doctors by chance.
6. RELATED WORK
Risk-adaptive access control have been studied in [2, 1, 3]. The
JASON report [2] described the concepts of risk quantiﬁcation and
access quotas. Later, Cheng et al. [1] proposed a risk-adaptive ac-
cess control solution based on the multi-level security model. Re-
cently, Ni et al. [3] proposed another solution based on fuzzy infer-
ences and they compared the features of different fuzzy operations.
We have described why existing risk-based access control solution-
s may not be directly applied to health IT systems in Section 3.1.
None of the above work on risk-adaptive access control performs
experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of their solutions. Experi-
mental results were not reported in [2] or [1]; the experiments in [3]
focused on time efﬁciency rather than effectiveness with regards
to risk quantiﬁcation. In this paper, we conducted experiments to
show that malicious users will indeed aggregate much higher risk
than honest users in our system.
7. CONCLUSION
We have proposed an access control model that allows informa-
tion consumers to make access decisions, while quantifying the risk
associated with their actions. The goal of our risk-quantiﬁcation
solution is to effectively enforce the principle of need-to-know in
health IT systems so as to protect patients’ privacy. In our solution,
the risk is low, if a doctor mostly accesses the information needed
in her tasks; otherwise, if a doctor over-accesses patients’ data, the
risk is high. We have implemented a prototype of our solution and
performed simulations on real-world medical history records. The
experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of our solution.
