Abstract. Real-world services rangingfrom cloud solutions toconsult-
ing currently dominate economic activity. Yet, despite the increasing
number of service marketplaces online, service trading on the Web re-
mains highly restricted. Services are at best traded within closed silos
that offer mainly manual search and comparison capabilities through a
Web storefront. Thus, it is seldom possible to automate the customisa-
tion, bundling, and trading of services, which would foster a more effi-
cientandeffectiveservicesector.InthispaperwepresentLinkedUSDL,

1 Introduction
The importance of real-world services, that is business activities of a mostly
intangible nature (e.g., life insurance, consulting), has grown over the last 50
years to dominate economic activity [1]. Because of their intangible nature, ser-
vicescanoftenbe bundled, adapted,andtradedinanautomatedmanner.Inan
attempttoexploittheWebasaservicetradingplatformanumberofservicemar-
ketplaces have emerged, ranging from purely technical registries like UDDI [2],
to business-oriented marketplaces such as Google Helpouts. Technical registries
have for the most part focussed on the computer science aspects of services
which is limiting as it ignores fundamental characteristics of services including
the economic, social, and business contexts [3]. Business-oriented marketplaces
on the other hand havefocussed on providing silos that offer limited searchand

comparisoncapabilitiesthroughanessentiallyhuman-orientedstorefront[4]. As
a result, common and essential economic activities in the service sector such
as the generation of customised offerings, the creation and trading of possibly
cross-domain and multi-provider service bundles, or simply the communication
between customer and provider remain largely manual activities [4].
Supporting the trading of services over the Web in an open, scalable, and
automated manner enabling the opportunistic engagement of multiple cross-
domain providers requires a shared means for capturing and reasoning upon
the economic, social, and technical aspects governing service exchanges [1,3,4].

while it also exhibited limitations with respect to the level of extensibility and
automation supported. In this paper we present Linked USDL1, a new vocabu-
lary which builds upon the results and experience gained with USDL combined
with prior research on Semantic Web Services, business ontologies, and Linked
Data to better support Web-scale automated service trading. We present the
methodology and main decisions adopted for transforming the complex USDL
specification into a network of vocabularies that is anchored on simplicity as
well as on vocabulary and data reuse. The resulting vocabulary is thoroughly
evaluated in terms of domain coverage, suitability for purpose, and its current
level of adoption.

Service Science aims to reach a better understanding of services, service net-
works, value co-creation and service innovation, to name a few of the main re-
search topics [1]. These efforts, which encompass several disciplines, are geared
towardsestablishingsolidfoundationsforadvancingourabilitytodesign,create,
and analyse service systems with both business and societal purposes in mind.
Relevant work in Computer Science includes service-oriented systems, which

warecomponents calledWeb services [2]. This area has been prolific in terms of
both tooling and specifications including a number of approaches for describing
technical services semantically, e.g., OWL-S, SAWSDL, and WSMO [5,6]. Al-
though(semantic)Webservicesworkprovidesadvancedsupportfordiscovering
or composing technical services, it disregards the fundamental socio-economic
context of real-world services (e.g., value chains and offerings), and does not

nal to the business characteristics of the services offered (e.g., speed of internet
connection offered) which are essential to service trading.

aimed to support both services and products, it is mostly centred on products

USDL [4,10] is, to date, the most comprehensive approach to supporting the
description of services for automated processing. USDL consists of 9 modules
modelledineCorecapturing services,interactioninterfaces, pricingmodels, ser-
vice level agreements, and related legal issues2. Despite its comprehensive sup-
port, this effort underestimated the need for such an all encompassing model
to be widely open, highly flexible and extensible, and yet simple in nature [11].
On the one hand, the rather centralised and controlled nature of the approach
led to an overly complex model hard to grasp and apply. On the other hand,
eCore exhibited technical limitations towards its extensibility and its use as a
lingua franca on the Web where Linked Data and light semantics are currently
considered a more adequate technology.
3 Requirements Analysis
Informedbyresearchcarriedoutonservices,including the relatedworkcovered
earlier, we have elicited a number of requirements that Linked USDL and any
other language or vocabulary with such an ambitious purpose should address.
This includes notablycoveragerequirements,whichwe shall coverfirst. We also
presentadditionalcriteriathatweidentifiedduringthestandardisationactivities
of USDL as potential issues and limitations for its Web-scale adoption [11].

in benefits to the actors involved. Fundamental to the notion of service is
therefore its functionality in terms of what it does, requires, and provides.
Giventhe highly diversenatureofservicesthis shouldcoverthe entirespec-
trum from fully automated provisioning (e.g., Spotify) to those essentially
manual (e.g., car repair service). Depending on the stakeholder, the level
of abstraction could vary from a detailed operational view (provider), to a
high-level one for customers.
Agents and Networks. Services delivery engages several stakeholders in
(possibly ephemeral) ad-hoc business networks, e.g., banks often engage
in partnerships with insurances to provide accounts with integrated travel
insurance. The modelling of services should seamlessly support both the
emergence and analysis of such networks in order to enable the dynamic
co-creationofvaluethroughWeb-wideservicetrading.Importantaspectsto
be coveredare thus the agents involved in a certain network and the role(s)
they play.
Service Relationships. Thanks to their intangible nature, services can be
combined, repurposed, andadapted to better fulfil customer needs. Services
are often related to other services and products. For instance, services can
often be enhanced with others, or there can be variations over established
types.Servicesareoftenbundled,i.e.,aggregatedandofferedjointlyinpack-
ageslikebroadbandandTVservices.Andinthecaseofautomatedservices,
services may be composed according to specific data and control flow to
achieve a complex objective out of simpler components.
Operational and Delivery. Thedeliveryofservicesisoftensubjecttorestric-
tions or conditions. These may range from geographical concerns (e.g., the
insuredindividual shouldlive inthe UK), temporal availability, legalissues,
variablepricing, andsoon. Froma serviceprovideroperationalperspective,
there may well be limitations due to the resources required, e.g., staffing,
that need to be tracked as they determine the costs and the capacity for
providing a service.
Consumption. Services are most often accessed or “consumed” through in-
teractions by means of designated communication channels. For example,
makinganinsuranceclaimmayrequirethecustomertophonetheinsurance
company, or fill up a form online. These communication channels may vary
during the service delivery process (e.g., initially claim by phone and check
the progress online), and there may exist restrictions on how interactions
shouldtakeplace.Forinstance a carrepairservicemayrequireyoutobring
the car to the garage whereas in other cases the service may take care of
sending a mechanic within some geographical boundaries.
3.2 Language Requirements
In addition to the aforementioned coverage requirements, research in the area
has highlighted further requirements that the language should meet. First and
foremost given the complexity of the domain and the fact that the aim is to
maximise to the extent possible the level of automation that can be achieved
72 C. Pedrinaci, J. Cardoso, and T. Leidig
during the life-cycle of services, the modelling of services needs to rely on a
conceptual model with formal foundations that can enable automated process-
ing [3,10]. Nonetheless the language should be modular and extensible in order
to be able to accommodate different domains and the many facets of services
while minimising the complexity for users and tool developers.
Oursubsequentworkonstandardisationhighlightedthatalthoughnecessary,
these requirements did not appear to be sufficient for Web-scale adoption:
An Open Solution. To support the engagement of any business entity across
anydomainthetechnologicalapproachshouldbeopen.Itshouldbeopenso
as to allow anybody to engage and trade services online, as well as towards

A Web-Based Solution. A scenario like the one envisaged requires an ap-
proachthat cansupportthe engagementofmillionsofserviceprovidersand
consumersinexposing,locating,interpreting,andcontractingservices.This
necessarily calls for highly interoperable and scalable solutions in terms of
data sharing, data processing, and communication protocols.
Promoting Take Up. While providing an open solution is likely to have a
positive impact on technology take up, adoption will largely be determined
bythesimplicitywithwhichanybusinessentitycouldadoptasolutionbased
on these technologies and the compatibility with existing legacy systems.
4 Linked USDL Vocabulary
Driven by the aforementioned requirements and informed by the drawbacksex-
hibited by USDL we worked on Linked USDL focussing essentially on reducing
the complexity underlying USDL and fostering its wider adoption through the
use of Web-centric technologies that are more amenable to extension, modifica-
tion, and automation at large scale.
4.1 Design Decisions
First, due to the success, scale, growth, and current adoption of the Web for
world-wide telecommunication and electronic commerce we believe that any
technology hoping to enable service trading online should necessarily embrace
andbuildupon the Webprinciples andtechnologies[12]. NotablyLinkedUSDL

by using URIs to identify services and providers; ii) the use of links to other
resourcesonthe Web to enricha particulardatum with reusable and externally
provided information, e.g., pointing to complementary services; iii) the use of
HTTP as a simple uniform protocol for supporting interactions; and iv) the
decoupling between resources and their representation. Doing so brings a tech-
nology stack that has proven to support large scale, efficient, multi-party inter-
actions, as well as it directly provides an integration point with open, standard
technologies that are already widely used and supported.
