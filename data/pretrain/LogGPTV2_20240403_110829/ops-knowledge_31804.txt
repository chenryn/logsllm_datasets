I placed a simple Python script in the `cgi-bin` directory of an Apache2 server and attempted to execute it via a web browser using the following URL:
```
http://www.example.com/cgi-bin/test.py
```
However, I encountered a 500 Internal Server Error. Below is the relevant portion of the Apache2 error log:

```
[Sun Jul 29 22:07:51 2012] [error] (8)Exec format error: exec of '/usr/lib/cgi-bin/test.py' failed
[Sun Jul 29 22:07:51 2012] [error] [client ::1] Premature end of script headers: test.py
[Sun Jul 29 22:07:51 2012] [error] [client ::1] File does not exist: /var/www/favicon.ico
```

Could anyone provide assistance with this issue?

**Solution:**

Based on BlaXpirit's answer, the 500 Internal Server Error can be resolved by ensuring that the correct HTTP headers are printed at the beginning of your CGI script. Specifically, you need to print the `Content-Type` header followed by a blank line. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

```python
print("Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8")
print()
# Your script logic here
```

It is important to note the newline character (`\n`) after the `Content-Type` header. This is necessary even if your Python program is only performing server-side operations and not sending any content back to the browser. The presence of these headers ensures that the server correctly interprets the output of your script.

If your script is still not working, ensure that:
1. The script has the correct file permissions (e.g., `chmod +x test.py`).
2. The first line of your script specifies the correct path to the Python interpreter (e.g., `#!/usr/bin/env python3`).

These steps should help resolve the 500 Internal Server Error.
