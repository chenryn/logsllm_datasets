### Introduction

Let's start with the ubiquitous terms: "Security" and "Research."

In popular publications and websites, "security" often describes all things related to a consumer's secure use of their hardware and software. "Security research" in this context generally refers to a company's best efforts to keep their product safe and secure. This can lead to the image of a security researcher as a lone, mythic scholar protecting users from viruses, phishing, pharming trojans, and other threats.

However, even in this context, it is unclear what "keeping a product safe and secure" means:
- Safe for whom? The user or the company's intellectual property (IP)?
- What is being researched, and whose best interests are being served?

If you have any questions about this, I suggest reading End User License Agreements (EULAs) before drawing conclusions.

### Simplifying Security

Security can be broken down into its simplest constituent part: identifying, codifying, and tracking communications. In other words, a device that has no connection to the wider world is of no interest when discussing security. A connected device is mandatory for any meaningful discussion of security. All issues surrounding security revolve around this, with the exception of personnel security and access to secured data and systems, which is a different topic altogether.

### Security Researchers

For security researchers of all types, the term "security" has much more profound implications. Security is often pursued in the abstract and theoretical, with a view to practical day-to-day implications. It frequently involves semi-obscure topics such as cryptography and cryptanalysis and requires an intimate familiarity with the intricacies of machine hardware and pattern predictability, among other things.

In short, the security researcher often works in theory and advanced analysis but ultimately must answer to their own company or to those who retain them. Dark hat researchers, while not subject to the same oversight, may not always have an advantage in a journalist's mind.

### Journalists

There are many types of journalists covering the security area. The most well-known cover areas related to firewalls, anti-virus programs, and similar topics. Others cover security breaches, such as the Department of Defense's loss of laptop computers, identity theft, or credit card phishing scams. Some journalists also cover the "art" of security and the ethical implications of covering up security breaches or soliciting breaches in the name of better "open" security.

By and large, most journalists covering the security beat are well-versed, highly competent, and minimally compromised by corporate concerns (and many are underpaid).

### Publications & Websites

There is typically a difference between printed publications and websites:
- **Timeliness:** Websites can provide more timely information.
- **Depth of Analysis:** Both formats now offer comparable depth.
- **Overhead:** Operating a website generally has lower overhead, which has implications for advertisers and content verification.

### Security Research from a Journalist's Perspective

Serious journalists typically see the issues surrounding security as matters of law, politics, and economics. Many times, these issues revolve around personal freedoms, censorship, and constitutional law. At a deeper level, they involve privacy, cryptography, and freedom of expression. A journalist's view of security colors their approach and definitions of these topics.

### Differences Between Security Bloggers and Print Journalists

- **Security Bloggers:** They are the mainstay of serious research, providing timely and intense near-real-time reporting.
- **Print Journalists:** They bring better analytical and cross-related event coverage. However, in some cases, print can be "compromised" by the very audience it seeks to reach.
