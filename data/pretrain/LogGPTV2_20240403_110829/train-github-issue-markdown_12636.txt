Subject: Proposal for Append-Only Mode in Elasticsearch Indices

Dear Team,

Currently, Elasticsearch does not support a parameter to switch indices into an append-only mode. This feature could significantly enhance performance, particularly in scenarios where the ingestion rate is a limiting factor. We have been addressing several potential bottlenecks, including DocValues merges for sparse fields and synchronous translog operations. However, we have also identified version lookups as a significant source of CPU contention, which can be seen in the attached Java Mission Control profile (Figure 1).

*Figure 1: Profiler showing that version lookups consume up to 25% of CPU time.*

While our tests were conducted with small documents, the implications extend to log and metric aggregation, which are common use cases for Elasticsearch. In these scenarios, append-only indices would be highly beneficial. Although Elasticsearch is a general-purpose distributed search and analytics engine, many applications, such as log and metric aggregation, do not require concurrent updates or version control.

One of Lucene's strengths is its internal append-only segments. Extending this principle to higher-level indices in Elasticsearch could provide a significant performance boost. By allowing indices to be marked as append-only at creation, we can eliminate the overhead of version lookups and reduce contention issues, such as those mentioned in issue #18053.

In our testing, disabling version control in Elasticsearch resulted in a 50% increase in indexing speed (Figure 2). Our test environment consisted of two machines, each with four CPU cores, and indices had only one replica.

I would greatly appreciate any feedback on this proposal. Am I missing any obvious drawbacks or considerations? Thank you for your time and input.
