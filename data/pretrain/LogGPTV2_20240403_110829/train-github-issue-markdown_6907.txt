The code should be unreachable in fact that a is immutable. A warning should

**Actual behavior:**  
No unreachable warning.
# Proposal
I know that it could be a little bit difficult to check if we check a property
of an object. But for primititves it should work. the compiler already knows
if it is a constant and did not allow them to assign twice.
