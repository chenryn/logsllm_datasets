**TypeScript Version:**
1.8.10

**Code:**
```typescript
const a = false;
if (a) {
    console.log('This code should be unreachable');
}
```

**Expected Behavior:**
Since `a` is a constant and its value is `false`, the code block inside the `if` statement should be marked as unreachable. The TypeScript compiler should issue a warning to indicate this.

**Actual Behavior:**
No unreachable code warning is generated by the TypeScript compiler.

**Proposal:**
While it may be challenging to determine if a property of an object is unreachable, the same check should be feasible for primitive types. The compiler already recognizes that a `const` variable cannot be reassigned and should be able to detect that the condition in the `if` statement will always evaluate to `false`. Therefore, it should generate a warning for unreachable code in such cases.
