User: I would like a user on Windows to be able to run my Python program, so I want to convert it to a .bat file. Is there a way to convert it? I've tried searching, but didn't find anything.
Assistant: No, I don't think you can reasonably expect to do this.
Batch files are executed by the Windows command interpreter, which is way way more primitive. 
Python is a full-blown programming language with a rich and powerful library of standard modules for all sorts of tasks. All the Windows command interpreter can do is act like a broken shell.
On the other hand, Python is available on Windows, so just tell the user to install it and run your program directly.
