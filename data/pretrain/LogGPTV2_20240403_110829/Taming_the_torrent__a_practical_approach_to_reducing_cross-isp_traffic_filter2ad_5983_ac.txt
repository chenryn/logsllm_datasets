Figure 3: CDF of average number of AS hops to reach Ono-

33% of paths to Ono-recommended peers do not leave the AS
of origin and the median number of ASes crossed by paths to
Ono-recommended peers is half of those picked at random by
BitTorrent.
those peers are typically along short paths, the average of those
path lengths takes on a small range of values, often integers.
Of course, IP hop counts (greater than 1) do not necessarily tell
us whether trafﬁc crosses ISPs. To better estimate the number of
ISPs crossed by a particular path, we mapped each IP address in a
traceroute measurement to its corresponding AS number.
Figure 3 presents a CDF of the number of AS hops taken along
paths between Ono clients and their peers. Similar to the previous
graph, each value on the curve represents the average number of
hops for all peers, either located by Ono or picked at random
by BitTorrent, seen by a particular Ono client during a six-hour
interval. The most striking property is that over 33% of the paths
found by Ono do not leave the AS of origin. Further, the median
number of AS hops along a path found by Ono is one, whereas
this is the case for less than 10% of the paths found by BitTorrent
at random. Thus, Ono signiﬁcantly reduces the overall amount
of cross-ISP trafﬁc,
thereby promoting “good Internet citizen”
behavior that beneﬁts not only the origin ISP but also nearby
networks.
Finally, we note that the percent of observed intra-AS paths
(average path length less than 1) found by unbiased BitTorrent

peers is over two orders of magnitude smaller than that to peers

(8.2%) is signiﬁcantly lower than those reported from simulations
of P2P environments that use synthetic network graphs (14.6% [3]).
6.3 Path Characteristics
Now that we have shown that CDN-based oracles for biased
peer selection signiﬁcantly reduce cross-ISP trafﬁc, we take up the
question of how this biased selection impacts performance. We
ﬁrst evaluate the end-to-end latency between Ono clients and their
peers. The CDF in Fig. 4 presents the average RTT, in milliseconds,
for ICMP pings to peers found by Ono and those found at random
via BitTorrent. Note the log scale of the x-axis. The ﬁgure clearly
shows that peers found by Ono are extremely close to each other
in terms of latency. For instance, the median latency to Ono-
recommended peers is 6 ms whereas the same for peers picked at
random is 530 ms – a difference of two orders of magnitude!
Another notable feature of the graph is the large number of
values where ping latency was exactly 1 ms. The reason is that
Windows returns only integer values for ping latencies and returns
“< 1 ms” for those values less than one. For all such cases, we
round the value of the RTT up to 1 ms. The integer property also
explains the small step at RTT values of 2 ms.
Another important path characteristic that determines transfer
performance is packet loss.
In Fig. 5, we use our traceroute
measurements to estimate packet loss rates along paths between
peers. The graph clearly shows that paths to Ono-recommended
peers have lower loss rates than those to peers selected at random
by unbiased BitTorrent. On average, paths to Ono-recommended
peers exhibit nearly 31% lower loss rates and their median loss rate
is 0, whereas the median loss rate for paths to unbiased peers is
2.1%.
6.4 Transfer Performance
Based on the latency and packet loss data in the previous section,
we expect that transfer performance from Ono-recommended peers
should be higher than, or at least on par with, those picked at
random from BitTorrent.
Figures 6(a) and 6(b) present CDFs of the average download
and upload rates for biased and unbiased connections on a semilog
scale. For this and the following ﬁgures, we use all transfer rate
samples where the connection was able to sustain a 4 KB/s transfer
rate at least once. Connections with lower rates tend to be choked
and do not contribute meaningfully to this analysis.
In fact,
We begin by observing that peers recommended by Ono pro-
vide signiﬁcantly higher peak download rates than those picked
at random.
this distribution features a heavy tail—
although the median download rate from Ono- recommended peers
is slightly lower than those picked at random by BitTorrent, the
average download rate for Ono is 31% higher than that of unbiased
BitTorrent. This seems to indicate that the relatively high quality of
paths recommended by Ono also results in higher peak throughput
when there is sufﬁcient available bandwidth.
Despite the fact that Ono reduces cross-ISP trafﬁc by proactively
reconnecting to nearby peers regardless of available bandwidth,
the difference between median transfer rates for Ono and unbiased
BitTorrent is only 2 KB/s. Even when Ono-recommended peers do
not provide higher median throughput than those picked at random,
our approach does not noticeably affect time to completion for
downloads. This holds because Ono-recommended peers are only
a fraction of the entire set of peers connected to each client and
BitTorrent generally saturates a peer’s available bandwidth with the
remaining connections.
Initially, we expected higher median performance for Ono-
recommended peers, given the low latencies and packet
loss
along paths to them. Based on the relatively low average per-
connection transfer rates in both curves (around 10KB/s), we
posit that performance gains for Ono-recommended peers are
limited because BitTorrent peers are generally overloaded. By
splitting each peer’s bandwidth over a large number of peers,
the BitTorrent system achieves high global transfer rates while
generally providing relatively low individual transfer rates to each
connection.
In this case, the bottleneck for BitTorrent clients is
the access link to the ISP (as opposed to the cross-ISP link) [7],
so BitTorrent sees no signiﬁcant performance difference between
peers along paths with or without cross-ISP links. We now show
that this feature is not universal;
it depends on ISPs’
bandwidth-allocation policies.
rather,
Figure 7 shows a CDF of download rates from Ono clients
located in the RDSNET ISP,2 in Romania. The ISP is notable for
offering 50Mb/s unrestricted transfer rates over ﬁber for in-network
trafﬁc (i.e., trafﬁc inside the ISP) and 4Mb/s to connections outside
the ISP, effectively pushing the bandwidth bottleneck to the edge
of the network. The ﬁgure clearly shows that Ono thrives in this
environment, signiﬁcantly improving the download rates of Ono-
