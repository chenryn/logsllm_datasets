This workshop addresses the security and privacy issues that have
developed as our society has become more interconnected, specifi-
cally with respect to multimedia data generated in the context of
the Internet of Things (IoT) and Web 2.0/3.0. The word “multime-
dia” here has expanded beyond its original scope. With the rise of
social media and online P2P sharing services, large quantities of
multimedia data (e.g., pictures, videos, audio, and computer graph-
ics) are being created and shared constantly. When all these data
are stored in a networked environment, many people can connect
to it for viewing, sharing, commenting, and storing information.
Particularly, multimedia data in IoT networks serves a significant
purpose as many people’s status, locations, and live actions can be
seen, disseminated, tracked, commented on, and monitored in real
time. IoT opens up many possibilities for attacks since more people
can broadcast themselves and allow their networks and networks’
networks to view and share in their lives.
There are also increased criminal activities in this space such as
online fraud, cyber piracy, unauthorized access, malware, denial of
service, phishing, social engineering, and identity theft, many of
which involve multimedia data and devices. All of these present new
technical challenges in related areas in cyber security such as access
control, user and device authentication, data leakage protection,
privacy enhancing technologies, identity management, digital wa-
termarking, digital right management, and digital forensics. Other

new challenges include new problems such as large-scale attacks
and prevention, the strength of security protection (e.g., common
encryption algorithms), hiding malware within multimedia data,
location-based privacy with high accuracy and anonymity.
The 2nd International Workshop on Multimedia Privacy and
Security (MPS 2018), as a part of CCS 2018, focuses on the above-
mentioned concerns. We solicited manuscript submissions on new
and innovative research into methods, techniques, and proofs-of-
concepts supported by strong theories, algorithms, simulations
and experimentation for the workshop. We received 18 valid sub-
missions from Asia, the Middle East, Europe, and North America.
We have followed vigorous review processes, from which 6 were
accepted as full papers and a further 7 as short papers, detailing
ongoing research. A keynote address was given by Prof. Konrad Re-
ick of the Technische Universität Braunschweig, Germany, on the
topic “Family Reunion: Adversarial Machine Learning meets Digital
Watermarking.”
