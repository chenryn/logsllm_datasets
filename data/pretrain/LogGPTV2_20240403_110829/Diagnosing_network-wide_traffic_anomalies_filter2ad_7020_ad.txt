# Volume Anomaly Detection and Quantification

## 1. Introduction
This section presents the results of applying our method to detect, identify, and quantify volume anomalies in link traffic using both Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) and Fourier analysis techniques. The datasets used are Sprint-1, Sprint-2, and Abilene.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 EWMA
From the class of forecasting-based techniques, we selected EWMA (also known as exponential smoothing). This algorithm predicts the next value in a given time series based on recent history. Specifically, if \( z_t \) denotes the traffic in an OD flow at time \( t \), then the EWMA prediction for time \( t + 1 \) is given by:
\[
\hat{z}_{t+1} = \alpha z_t + (1 - \alpha) \hat{z}_t
\]
where \( 0 \leq \alpha \leq 1 \) is a parameter that controls the relative weight placed on past values. We used a multi-grid parameter search and found that values of \( 0.2 \leq \alpha \leq 0.3 \) effectively isolated spikes in our data. Anomalies are quantified by the difference between the forecasted and actual values, i.e., \( |z_t - \hat{z}_t| \).

### 2.2 Fourier Analysis
From the class of signal analysis techniques, we used Fourier analysis to capture diurnal trends in OD flows over long periods. Each OD flow time series was approximated as a weighted sum of eight Fourier basis functions, corresponding to traffic variations with periods of 7 days, 5 days, 3 days, 24 hours, 12 hours, 6 hours, 3 hours, and 1.5 hours. The size of an anomaly is the difference between the actual value and the modeled value, \( |z_t - \hat{z}_t| \), where \( \hat{z}_t \) is the Fourier approximation.

## 3. Results

### 3.1 Detection and Identification
Figure 5(a) shows the top 40 anomalies isolated by the Fourier scheme for each dataset. A sharp knee in the rank-ordered plot of anomaly sizes suggests that the largest anomalies are qualitatively different from the smaller ones. For the Sprint datasets, anomalies greater than \( 2 \times 10^7 \) bytes are considered important, while for the Abilene dataset, the threshold is \( 8 \times 10^7 \) bytes.

The subspace detection method, applied with a 99.9% confidence limit, detected nearly every anomaly above the cutoff value. Figure 5(b) shows that nearly every detected anomaly was successfully identified, with consistent accuracy across all three datasets.

### 3.2 Quantification
Figure 5(c) compares the true anomaly size to the estimated size obtained via quantification. Despite some sensitivity to error in the Fourier analysis, the results show that quantification can generally estimate the anomaly size reasonably accurately.

### 3.3 Detailed Diagnosis
Table 2 provides detailed diagnosis results. For example, in Sprint-1, all 9 anomalies were correctly detected and identified, with only one false alarm. The higher false alarm rates in Abilene are attributed to the noisier nature of the traffic data. Overall, the average quantification estimates for all but one dataset are within 21% of the true anomaly size, which is sufficiently accurate for operational settings.

## 4. Synthetic Volume Anomalies

To further validate the effectiveness of the subspace method, we injected synthetic anomalies into the OD flows of Sprint-1 and Abilene. Large injections matched the largest anomalies seen in each dataset, while small injections were set slightly below the cutoff to evaluate false alarm rates.

### 4.1 Detection Rates
Figure 6 shows mean detection rates for large injections in Sprint-1, indicating a fairly constant detection rate regardless of the injection time. Figure 7 presents histograms of detection rates for both large and small injections, confirming high detection rates for large anomalies and low false alarm rates for small anomalies.

### 4.2 Scatter Plots
Figure 8 provides scatter plots of mean detection rates for large injections and mean OD flow rates, further validating the high detection and low false alarm rates of the subspace method.

## 5. Conclusion
Our results demonstrate that the subspace diagnosis procedure has high detection rates and low false alarm rates, regardless of the dataset or validation method used. This confirms the robustness and reliability of our approach for detecting and quantifying volume anomalies in network traffic.
