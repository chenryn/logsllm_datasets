As of threejs version 112 a directional light with castShadow set to true adds
a yellow tint to objects on some devices including the Pixel 3a. Confirmed on
the Pixel 3a using both Chrome 79 and Firefox 68.4.1.
Here's a demo of the issue (no cdn for 112 exists so you'll have to download
it)  
The cube should be a yellowish green.  
The yellow tint goes away if you do one of the following:
  * use a previous version of threejs
  * comment out 'mainLight.castShadow = true'
  * skip enabling the shadowMap on the renderer.
