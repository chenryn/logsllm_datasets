## Abstract
Wi-Fi hotspot-based data clone services are increasingly used by Android users to transfer their user data and preferred configurations when upgrading from old phones to new models. Unfortunately, these services often need to handle sensitive information protected by the Android system, and vulnerabilities in their design or implementation can lead to data privacy breaches. In this paper, we present an empirical security analysis of eight widely used Wi-Fi hotspot-based data clone services deployed on millions of Android phones. Our study evaluates these services in terms of data export/import, data transmission, and Wi-Fi configuration, focusing on the security requirements that such services should meet. Given that these services are closed-source, we designed Poirot, an analysis system to recover the workflows of the data clone services and detect potential flaws. Our study reveals a series of critical security issues in the data clone services. We demonstrate two types of attacks that exploit the data clone service as a new attack surface. A vulnerable data clone service allows attackers to retrieve sensitive user data without permissions and even inject malicious content to compromise the system.

## 1. Introduction
Modern mobile phones store large amounts of sensitive user data, such as personal emails and account passwords. To protect against security threats like data theft and malware, mobile operating systems (OSes) have introduced various security mechanisms, including full disk encryption and app data isolation. However, when a user wants to transfer data from an old phone to a new one, the process faces both usability and privacy challenges. Official data backup and restore mechanisms for Android and iOS typically require a cloud drive (e.g., Google Drive, iCloud) or a desktop computer as an intermediary. Although users do not frequently replace their phones, 55.56% update to a new phone every 12 or 24 months. These traditional methods are inefficient and inconvenient. Additionally, exporting sensitive data to a cloud drive or hard disk raises concerns about data abuse or leakage.

To ensure a secure and smooth data migration, many Android manufacturers have developed Wi-Fi hotspot-based data clone services. These services establish a private, temporary Wi-Fi network between two phones, allowing direct data transfer. This method is fast, does not require third-party storage, and grants system privileges to access sensitive data (e.g., app login credentials). Consequently, many manufacturers embed these services as default features in their phones. Table 1 lists the estimated number of devices affected by the vulnerabilities we identified.

Designing a secure data clone service is challenging because developers may prioritize usability over security [36] and may not fully comply with the Android security model [24]. Despite claims of addressing security issues, the implementations are closed-source and lack comprehensive assessments. Therefore, we conducted a systematic study of popular Wi-Fi hotspot-based data clone services from eight mainstream Android manufacturers. To our knowledge, this is the first analysis of this application scenario. Our goal is to evaluate whether these services meet essential security goals, such as confidentiality, integrity, and authentication. We developed Poirot, an analysis system to recover undocumented workflows and proprietary data transmission protocols. Poirot performs static and dynamic analyses to inspect the behavior of each data clone service, including code execution and network traffic. We analyzed the services from three perspectives: data export and import, data transmission, and Wi-Fi configuration. Our results show that these services contain serious design flaws. To protect end-users, we reported the identified flaws to the relevant manufacturers. We hope our study will guide the revision of similar functions and the development of new services securely.

To demonstrate the practical impact of these flaws, we designed two types of attacks that can be launched remotely through wireless communication or locally via a malicious app on either the old or new phone. Seven out of eight investigated services are vulnerable to at least one attack. Since these services are pre-installed system components, we estimated the number of affected mobile phones based on sales data from each manufacturer.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the background of Wi-Fi hotspot-based data clone services. Section 3 describes our security analysis approach and Poirot. Section 4 reports the results of our analysis and introduces the designed attacks. Section 5 discusses related work, and Section 6 provides conclusions.

## 2. Wi-Fi Hotspot-Based Data Clone
Wi-Fi hotspot-based data clone is a data migration procedure between two Android phones, where a temporary, private Wi-Fi network is established. Compared to USB-based solutions (e.g., Android’s ADB backup and restore) and cloud-based solutions (e.g., Google Drive), this method is more convenient and faster, achieving speeds around 10MB/s without relying on the internet. It also does not consume mobile data.

Figure 1 shows the internal architecture of a Wi-Fi hotspot-based data clone service, which typically consists of a data clone app and supporting components implemented as system libraries or processes. The data clone procedure involves four steps:

1. **Wi-Fi Setup:** The data clone app on the old phone starts a private Wi-Fi hotspot, encodes the Wi-Fi information (SSID and password) into a QR code, and the new phone joins the WLAN by scanning the QR code.
2. **Data Export:** The app on the old phone lists exportable data for user selection, packs the selected data into files with customized formats, and compresses large files if necessary.
3. **Data Transmission:** Files are transferred using custom or existing protocols (e.g., TCP, FTP, HTTP) over multiple threads. Data clone services use security measures such as WPA2, TLS, and proprietary encoding/encryption to protect the data.
4. **Data Import:** The new phone's data clone app unpacks and restores the data to specific directories, requiring appropriate permissions.

### 2.1. Cloneable User Data
User data can be classified into four categories based on their storage locations and access permissions: SD card data, communication records, system settings, and app-related data.

- **SD Card Data:** The Android system supports SD cards for expanded storage. Specific user data (e.g., photos) are stored in the /sdcard partition.
- **Communication Records:** These include call logs, SMS, and other communication data.
- **System Settings:** These include device configurations and preferences.
- **App-Related Data:** This includes app data, login credentials, and other app-specific information.

In the following sections, we detail our security analysis approach and the results, along with the designed attacks to exploit the identified vulnerabilities.
