3.2 Recruitment of volunteers
Volunteers were recruited through John Krantz’s Psychological
Research on the Net website[Krantz 1998] which promotes and
indexes experiments of this kind. These volunteers were also en-
couraged to invite others to participate. Late volunteers were hence
partially recruited through social networks. Recruited participants
were not members of protected classes and were informed that
they could leave at any point. They were not asked any identifying
information and were informed not to use their input for security
purposes as their data would be collected for analysis.
Language. 51 participants wrote down English as their primary
language. French (28) and Hebrew (14 ) were the next two most re-
ported primary languages, followed by Arabic, Norwegian, Russian,
and Romanian.
4 RESULTS
The results focus on how participants chose words and how differ-
ent variables affected their choices, on their ability to remember
the words chosen, and on how they guessed other people’s words.
3.3 Statistics
Groups. A total of 125 people participated, who were randomly
assigned to three groups. Group 20 was shown an array of 20 words
to choose from and was composed of 47 volunteers. Group 100 was
shown an array of 100 words and had 52 volunteers. The control
group, with 26 volunteers, had their words chosen for them and
shown on the screen.
4.1 Word selection
Based on problems recognized in other studies[Blunch 1984; Lerman
and Hogg 2014; Payne Stanley 1951; Yang et al. 2016; Yue et al. 2010],
an original hypothesis was that word choice would be influenced
by three behaviours:
• Semantic: participants might choose words that are more
frequently used (and with which they were more familiar);
Conference’17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA

• Syntactic: participants might choose words that are com-
patible with others they chose, to create a sentence with a
common structure.
• Positional: participants might choose words that are either
among the first they read (on the top left corner), or closest
to the input fields;
A possible outcome that would make the proposed method inef-
fective – because of low entropy – is that people could all choose
the most familiar or frequent words from the array of n words
shown to them. Similarly, strong syntactic tendencies could lower
entropy by reducing the number of probable passphrases. On the
other hand, positional effects tend to increase the entropy as they
don’t depend on human biases but on random position, making the
distribution more uniform.
Results below showed that the second effect is much weaker than
could be expected, with some choosing bias caused by semantic
and positional effects.
4.1.1
Semantic effects. To analyse the semantic effects, we used
a dictionary with words sorted by decreasing order of frequency
in the n-words corpus. Frequent words are all within the first few
thousand words in this dictionary, whereas rare words are at the
end.
The histograms in Figure 2 show the distribution of the words
chosen depending on their frequency rank in the dictionary, for
each of the two main groups. To make the figure more legible, ranks
were aggregated in 30 buckets of 2923 words. Although we can
observe a bias in favour of more frequent and familiar words, it
is not automatic as 23% of words chosen still come from the least
frequent half of the dictionary. This depends on the group, with
group 20 having 26% rare words, and group 100 having 20%.
This frequency, F(i), is equal to the number of times the i-th most
frequent word in the array was chosen. Those histograms also
include show the distinction between primary English speakers and
others, inside each group. When given enough choice – in group 100
– non-primay speakers have a bigger tendency to choose frequent
words, with only 15% choosing rarer words. A single participant in
group 20 chose the 6 most frequent words in their array, which is
more than the expectation of uniform random choice of words1.

a function of their rank in the dictionary, by buckets of 2923
words
The significant fraction of words chosen from the second half
of the dictionary is not just due to some participants getting only
rare words, as the following figures show. Figures 3 and 4 show
the distribution of words chosen depending on their frequency
relative to the frequencies of the words shown to the participant.
4.1.2
Syntactic effects. Using common sentence structures might
help memorization, and some participants apparently tried to make
use of this property, one of them choosing "Freshman minions cine-
matically crumble lavender prints". However, most participants did
not seem to follow such a strategy in the passphrases they created.

Figure 6: Heatmap indicating the percentage of participants
choosing the word in each cell for group 100
Even when limiting the analysis to the four broadest grammati-
cal categories (noun/verb/adjective/adverb), most sentence struc-
tures were unique, with 67 grammatical structures seen only once
out of 99 passphrases. The grammatical structure in the exam-
ple passphrase (noun-verb-noun-noun-verb-noun) is among those
unique structures. 9 structures were seen twice and 3 were seen
thrice. The only relatively common structure, which was present 8
times, corresponds to a sequence of 6 nouns.
Figure 5 shows how present each grammatical category was in
each position in the passphrase. For example, adjectives are less
present as a second word than as a first. There is some imprecision
as words can fit in multiple categories (e.g. scars as a noun or a
verb). Nouns seem overrepresented, but this is consistent with their
frequency in the dictionary (≈ 60%). No correlations were found
between successive word categories, which would be difficult in
any case because of the multiple potential roles of each word and
additional inquiry should be conducted on the subject.

in passphrase
Figure 7: Heatmap indicating the percentage of participants
choosing the word in each cell for group 20
In group 20, 12 people created passphrases that made some
amount of semantic sense and followed English syntax, such as the
example given. 13 passphrases could make some sense but had un-
usual or incorrect syntax, such as "furry grills minidesk newsdesk
deletes internet". 22 appeared to be six randomly ordered words,
such as "wastewater refundable sweatshops misspelling sellout ail-
ment ". In group 100, only 6 people created passphrases that made
some amount of sense and were syntactically correct. 15 made
passphrases that could make some sense, and 30 had passphrases
that seemed randomly ordered.
4.1.3 Positional effects. The heat maps in Figures 6 and 7 show
how the position of a word in the array shown affected the prob-
ability that it would get chosen. The numbers correspond to the
percentage of participants who chose the word in that cell, with a
deeper red indicating a higher percentage. The numbers beside and
below the heat maps represent the total number of words chosen
by line and column.
We can see that there is a bias in favour of the lowest lines of the
array, as well as top line, with little horizontal bias (the choosing
bias is around 11% above average for group 20, with p < 0.02, and
26% for group 100, with p < 0.03, both analyses being done with
ANOVA) .
4.2 Memorization
After choosing a passphrase and performing a distractor task, par-
ticipants were asked to recall their original passphrase; 46% of
participants recalled all 6 words in their passphrase without any
errors. An additional 20% remembered their words but made a typo
somewhere.
The table in Figure 8 sums up the recall success rate and types
of errors when recalling passphrases. A full explanation is given
below. The rates are calculated separately for group 20, group 100,
and the control group. They are also split between the first and the
second section, in which (except for the control group) participants
were reminded of their original array of words.

the original passphrase.
Overall, 94% of the 51 people that were guided with 100 words
remembered at least 5 of their words, and 69% remembered all their
words but made a small mistake (like getting them in the wrong
order). 81% of the 47 people who were shown 20 words remembered
at least 5 of their words, and 64% made at most simple mistakes.
Those numbers reach respectively 38% and 27% in the control group.
When comparing the number of people who correctly remem-
bered their whole passphrase, group 100 is superior to the control
group (p < 0.02). This effect is magnified when comparing not
the participants but the words directly. The words in passphrases
made from the 100 words array were better remembered than those
made from the 20 words array (p < 0.03), with only 0.4 words
forgotten or wrong per participant against 0.7. Similarly, the words
in passphrases made from the 20 words array were themselves
much better remembered than the ones given to participants in
the control group (p < 10−4), who had an average of 1.3 words
forgotten.
