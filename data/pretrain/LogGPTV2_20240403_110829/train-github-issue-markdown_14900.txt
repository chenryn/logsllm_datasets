Hi,
we updated from Symfony `2.6` to `2.8` with the choice options you can find
below.  
We expected the label of our choice type should be hidden and just the value
and the input element exists. In 2.6 this worked for us.
When we upgraded to 2.8 (with the same options) the labels are shown again.
The Problem is caused by an empty string in the view, not as expected `false`.
    $resolver->setDefaults([
        'choices' => [1 => false, 2 => false, 3 => false, 4 => false, 5 => false],
        'expanded' => true,
        'placeholder' => false,
        'required' => false,
    ]);
So we added a workaround in our `bootstrap_3_layout.html.twig` to resolve
this.
    {%- block radio_label -%}
        {% if label == '' or label is null %}
            {% set label = false %}
        {% endif %}
        {{ parent() }}
    {%- endblock radio_label -%}
Is there a cleaner way to hide the label or is this a bug/bc break?
Thanks
