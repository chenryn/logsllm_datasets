User: What are the differences between a systems programming language and Application programming language?
Assistant: In general, a systems programming language is lower level than applications programming languages.  However, the language itself has nothing to do with it.. it's more the particulars of the implementation of the language.
For example, Pascal started life as a teaching language, and was pretty much strictly applications.. however, it was evolved into a systems language and was used to create early versions of MacOS and Windows.
C# is not, typically a systems language because it cannot do low-level work, although even that line is blurred as managed operating systems come into being.
