User: I am facing an issue while cloning a git repo.
I am using function clone_from from GitPython library

from git import Repo
Repo.clone_from("git://github.com/facebook/buck.git", "D:\sample")

I am getting error

WindowsError: The system cannot find the file specified

Can someone please tell me if this is how to clone a repo using the library?
Assistant: You might not have git.ext in your PATH, but that can easily be tested by executing it yourself.
If you see an error, you can either add it to the PATH, or set the GIT_PYTHON_GIT_EXECUTABLEto the executable git-python should execute for git commandline services.
