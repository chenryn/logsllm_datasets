We are using the Java client, and we have some custom code to inflate Java
objects from the returned doucments. The get and search APIs seem to return
completely different interfaces and object trees, even though they both
contain the same underlying information. This is a problem for us because our
inflation code is then duplicated which introduces possible bugs. Can the get
and search APIs on the Java client be refactored so they use the same data
structures for each hit returned?
