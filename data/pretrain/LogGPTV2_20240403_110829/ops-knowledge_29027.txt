User: I am trying to write the Code in Python to Change the Icon of a Mac OS X folder using just the Python Script (Without XCODE or any other API).
The procedure is that I have a icon.icns file , I need to change the folder icon to the icon.icns file using the python script.
Assistant: Let we have a icon.icns file:

Read the com.apple.ResourceFork extended attribute from the icon file
Set the com.apple.FinderInfo extended attribute with folder icon flag
Create a Icon file (name: Icon\r) inside the target folder
Set extended attributes com.apple.FinderInfo & com.apple.ResourceFork for icon file (name: Icon\r)
Hide the icon file (name: Icon\r)

We can use stat and xattr modules to do this.
