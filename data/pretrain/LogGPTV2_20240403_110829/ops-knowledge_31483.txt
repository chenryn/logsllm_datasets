User: My hard drive is full.
What is the easiest way to find out the TOP 5 FOLDERS that consume the most disk space?
A python solution would be greatly appreciated. I use Ubuntu Linux.
Assistant: You could just check the properties of each folder and look for the total size of the files in it. In Ubuntu, just right click on the folder, click properties and check the contents size. Not a python solution, but much easier (not everything needs a script to find the answer).  The biggest folders will likely be the ones at the top of the tree.
