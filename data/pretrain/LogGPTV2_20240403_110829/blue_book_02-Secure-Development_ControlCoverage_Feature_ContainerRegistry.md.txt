            Admin user in Container Registry must be disabledThe admin user is designed for a single
                user to access the registry. All users authenticating with the admin account appear as a single user to
                the registry. Admin users are having high privileged role increases the attack surface for the server
                without being tracked. Using AAD based identity ensures that there is a built-in high level of
                assurance in the user identity established for subsequent access control.

            Service principal identity should be used to access container images in Container RegistryUsing
                a 'user' account should be avoided because, in general, a user account will likely have broader set of
                privileges to enterprise assets. Using a dedicated SPN ensures that the SPN does not have permissions
                beyond the ones specifically granted for the given scenario.

            Credentials of service principal used for Container Registry must be stored in Key VaultKeeping/sharing
                password in clear text can lead to easy compromise at various avenues during an application's life
                cycle. Storing them in a key vault ensures that they are protected at rest.

            All users/identities must be granted minimum required permissions using Role Based Access Control
                    (RBAC)Granting minimum access by leveraging RBAC feature ensures that users are granted
                just enough permissions to perform their tasks. This minimizes exposure of the resources in case of
                user/service account compromise.

            Image vulnerability scan should be configured through webhook when images are pushed to Container
                    RegistryContainer image(s) having vulnerability (e.g. missing OS patches in base image,
                open ports in image) can lead to loss of sensitive enterprise data.

            Yes
            No
            Container Registry must have latest/patched image(s) all the timeUn-patched images are
                easy targets for compromise from various malware/trojan attacks that exploit known vulnerabilities in
                operating systems and related software.

            Content trust in Container Registry must be enabledContent trust gives the ability to
                verify both the integrity and the publisher of all the data received from a Registry over any channel.
                If a container image is served from an untrusted registry, the image itself may not be
                trustworthy/stable. Running such a compromised image can lead to loss of sensitive enterprise data.

            Activity logs for Data Container Registry should be reviewed periodicallyPeriodic reviews
                of activity and audit logs ensures that anomalous activity can be identified early enough instead of
                after a major compromise.
