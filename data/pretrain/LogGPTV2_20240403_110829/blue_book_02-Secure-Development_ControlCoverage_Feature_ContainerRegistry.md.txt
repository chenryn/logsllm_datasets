## IMPORTANT: DevOps Kit (AzSK) Sunset Notice
The DevOps Kit (AzSK) will be sunset by the end of FY21. For more details, please refer to the [AzSK Sunset Notice](../../../ReleaseNotes/AzSKSunsetNotice.md).

### Container Registry Security Controls

| Control | Description & Rationale | Severity | Automated | Fix Script Available |
|---------|-------------------------|----------|-----------|----------------------|
| **Admin User in Container Registry Must Be Disabled** | The admin user is designed for a single user to access the registry. All users authenticating with the admin account appear as a single user to the registry. Admin users have high-privileged roles, which increases the attack surface without being tracked. Using Azure Active Directory (AAD) based identity ensures a higher level of assurance in the user identity for subsequent access control. | High | Yes | Yes |
| **Service Principal Identity Should Be Used to Access Container Images** | A 'user' account should be avoided because it generally has broader privileges to enterprise assets. Using a dedicated service principal (SPN) ensures that the SPN does not have permissions beyond those specifically granted for the given scenario. | Medium | Yes | No |
| **Credentials of Service Principal Must Be Stored in Key Vault** | Storing and sharing passwords in clear text can lead to easy compromise at various points during an application's lifecycle. Storing them in a key vault ensures they are protected at rest. | High | No | No |
| **Minimum Required Permissions via Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** | Granting minimum access using RBAC ensures that users are granted just enough permissions to perform their tasks. This minimizes exposure of resources in case of user or service account compromise. | Medium | Yes | No |
| **Image Vulnerability Scan via Webhook** | Configuring image vulnerability scans through webhooks when images are pushed to the Container Registry helps identify vulnerabilities (e.g., missing OS patches in base images, open ports in images), which can lead to the loss of sensitive enterprise data. | Medium | Yes | No |
| **Container Registry Must Have Latest/Patched Images** | Un-patched images are easy targets for malware and trojan attacks that exploit known vulnerabilities in operating systems and related software. | Medium | No | No |
| **Content Trust Must Be Enabled** | Content trust allows verification of both the integrity and the publisher of all data received from the Registry over any channel. If a container image is served from an untrusted registry, the image may not be trustworthy or stable, leading to potential data loss. | Medium | Yes | No |
| **Periodic Review of Activity Logs** | Periodic reviews of activity and audit logs ensure that anomalous activity can be identified early, rather than after a major compromise. | Medium | No | No |
| **Only Signed Images Must Be Pushed** | Content trust allows verification of both the integrity and the publisher of all data received from the Registry over any channel. If a container image is served from an untrusted registry, the image may not be trustworthy or stable, leading to potential data loss. | Medium | No | No |

This table provides a structured overview of the security controls for the Container Registry, including the rationale, severity, automation status, and availability of fix scripts.
