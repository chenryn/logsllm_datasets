 **Symfony version(s) affected** : 4.3
**Description**  
URL parsing fails. For example:  
`https://nova.laravel.com/password/reset`  
This resolves correctly.  
However `https://nova.laravel.com//password/reset` this results in a 404.
Which could be seen as a user error.  
But `https://nova.laravel.com//foobar/password/reset` also resolves, however
incorrectly. Clearly signaling it as a bug.
**How to reproduce**  
Go to `https://nova.laravel.com//foobar/password/reset`. Or in any
Laravel/Symfony project add an extra `/` after the host.
**Possible Solution**  
I added a possible solution in this PR.
