# m00nwalk2
Forensics, 300 points
## Description:
> Revisit the last transmission. We think this transmission contains a hidden message. There are also some clues clue 1, clue 2, clue 3.
## Solution: 
This is a follow-up challenge to [m00nwalk](m00nwalk.md).
We receive the same transmission as before, and three clues:
```console
root@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/pico/m00nwalk2# ls *.wav
clue1.wav  clue2.wav  clue3.wav  message.wav
root@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/pico/m00nwalk2# diff message.wav ../m00nwalk/message.wav
root@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/pico/m00nwalk2#
```
The decode process is the same as before, with the single difference of having to chose "Auto" as the mode, instead of "Scottie 1".

Searching for "Alan Eliasen the Future Boy" brings us to [this  page](https://futureboy.us/stegano/), which talks about Steganography Tools.
> These pages use the steghide program to perform steganography, and the files generated are fully compatible with steghide.
So, let's use `steghide` to try and recover a hidden message from the original file:
```console
root@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/pico/m00nwalk2# steghide extract -sf message.wav -p hidden_stegosaurus
wrote extracted data to "steganopayload12154.txt".
root@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/pico/m00nwalk2# cat steganopayload12154.txt
picoCTF{the_answer_lies_hidden_in_plain_sight}
```
