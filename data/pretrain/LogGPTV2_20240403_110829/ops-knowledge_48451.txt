User: In a distributed system, the problem of file synchronization and conflict merging needs to be solved. Please provide a reasonable solution.
Assistant: One solution is as follows: 1. Based on the version control system (VCS): use VCS to manage files in the distributed system. All changes need to be committed and merged through VCS. 2. Conflict detection: When VCS is submitted and merged, it is necessary to perform conflict detection on the modification. If a conflict is found, the merge needs to be stopped and the user notified. 3. Conflict resolution: If a conflict is found, the user needs to manually resolve the conflict and resubmit the modification. 4. File synchronization: After the VCS is submitted, the modified file needs to be synchronized to all relevant nodes. 5. Version control: keep all modified historical versions in VCS, and allow users to roll back or restore as needed. 6. Misoperation recovery: VCS can also provide misoperation recovery function, so that users can restore to the previous state. To sum up, the VCS-based solution has high reliability and flexibility in file synchronization and conflict merging, and is a reasonable solution.
