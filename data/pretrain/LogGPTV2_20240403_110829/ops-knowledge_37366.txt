User: I want to make bottle python web service to serve binary files like pdf, picture and exe with authentication.
Is it possible to serve all this files using bottle? I have hard time finding a tutorial for that.
How about the performance? Does bottle python handle hundreds of thousands downloads simultaneously?
I am planning to use it with nginx uwsgi.
Assistant: If you are not in a hurry i suggest you to try uWSGI 1.9 (it is still in development but the first stable release will be in 10 days) and use offload-threads = n (set it to the number of cpus). In that way when you send a file from your app it will be asynced (and non blocking) served by a different thread, suddenly freeing your worker. Offloading is available in 1.4 too but it is not automatic for apps as in 1.9
