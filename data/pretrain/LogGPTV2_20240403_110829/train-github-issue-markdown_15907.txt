My current use case is to cluster a bunch of data to generate labels, then use
a classifier to draw decision boundaries and make label predictions on new
data.
I love using pipeline and gridsearch packages in tandem, but can't use it for
this because clustering does not have a transform method for X. Is it
worthwhile to make pipeline components chain-able by the labels_ attribute in
addition to transform?
