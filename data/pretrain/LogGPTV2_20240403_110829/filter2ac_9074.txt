### Title: PicoDMA: DMA Attacks at Your Fingertips

**Abstract:**

Direct Memory Access (DMA) attacks are a significant security threat, typically executed by an attacker who gains physical access to a high-speed expansion port on a target device. These attacks can be used to extract full disk encryption keys and other sensitive data from memory, bypass authentication, or modify process memory to enable backdoor access. The attack is carried out by connecting a hardware device to the victim's Thunderbolt or ExpressCard port, allowing the attacker to read physical memory pages directly.

Recent research has highlighted the practicality and scope of these attacks for a broader audience. Notable examples include Ulf Frisk's PCILeech framework, Trammel Hudson's Apple EFI firmware research (Thunderstrike I/II), Joe Fitz's SLOTSCREAMER hardware implant, and the recent release of the 'ThunderClap' tool and associated academic studies.

In this presentation, we introduce PicoDMA: a compact, stamp-sized DMA attack platform that utilizes the small (22 x 30 x 3.8 mm) and affordable (~$220 USD) PicoEVB FPGA board from RHS Research, LLC. The PicoEVB, despite its size, is well-equipped with a Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA and supports expansion via digital and analog I/O connectors. This M.2 2230 form-factor board is no larger than a typical laptop network card, making it ideal for embedding in space-constrained devices such as laptops and routers.

Our platform, combined with custom software, facilitates DMA security research at a more accessible price point. For real-world DMA attacks, the PicoEVB's small form factor makes it easily embeddable in various devices. We also support out-of-band management and payload delivery using radio modules, including 802.11, cellular, and LoRa. Adding wireless capabilities to our platform enables new variations of existing attacks, which will be discussed in detail.

The talk will feature live demonstrations and a public release of the software. Attendees will gain a deeper understanding of the risks posed by hardware implants and DMA attacks, equipping them with the knowledge to better protect their systems.
