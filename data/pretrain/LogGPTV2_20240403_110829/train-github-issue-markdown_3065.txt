I use electron 1.7.9 with node 7.9.0 on a raspberry pi
input list does get the actual value from the datalist.
I have a input element with a datalist in my electron application and it works
just fine if i run my .html file in Chrome. If I start the electron app with
"electron ." the input element is not working. My datalist is displayed but if
i choose one its set in my input list as suggested but if I do a alert of the
input-element I just get what I typed in and not the actual element what is in
the datalist. At this point I can not figure out how to fix that or is there
any possible solution? Another problem is that if I run my application locally
with "./node_modules/.bin/electron ." the datalist elements donÂ´t even show
up.
Maybe anyone can help me out if there is a solution for this or a way how I
can solve this.
