more concern, however, is the increasing threat of virtual
reality, as well as computer vision, as an adversarial tool.
It appears to us that the designers of face authentication
systems have assumed a rather weak adversarial model
wherein attackers may have limited technical skills and
be limited to inexpensive materials. This practice is
risky, at best. Unfortunately, VR itself is quickly becom-
ing commonplace, cheap, and easy-to-use. Moreover,
VR visualizations are increasingly convincing, making
it easier and easier to create realistic 3D environments
that can be used to fool visual security systems. As such,
it is our belief that authentication mechanisms of the fu-
ture must aggressively anticipate and adapt to the rapid
developments in the virtual and online realms.
Appendix
A Multi-Image Facial Model Estimation
In §3.2, we outline how to associate 2D facial landmarks
with corresponding 3D points on an underlying facial
model. Contour landmarks pose a substantial difficulty
for this 2D-to-3D correspondence problem because the
associated set of 3D points for these features is pose-
dependent. Zhu et al. [63] compensate for this phe-
nomenon by modeling contour landmarks with parallel
curved line segments and iteratively optimizing head ori-
entation and 2D-to-3D correspondence. For a specific
head orientation R j, the corresponding landmark points
on the 3D model are found using an explicit function
based on rotation angle:
si, j = f jPR j(Si(cid:31), j +t j)
Si(cid:31), j = ¯Si(cid:31) + Aid
i(cid:31) = land(i,R j),
i(cid:31) αid + Aexp
i(cid:31) αexp
j
corner landmarks, and this approach actually leads to in-
ferior results when multiple input images are used.
Therefore, different from Zhu et al. [63], we com-
pute the 3D facial model with Maximum a Posteriori
(MAP) estimation. We assume the alignment error of
each 3D landmark independently follows a Gaussian dis-
tribution. Then, the most probable parameters θ :=
({ f j},{R j},{t j},{αexp
j },αid) can be estimated by mini-
mizing the cost function

Here, Si(cid:31), j is computed using Eq. (6). Σid and Σexp
are covariance matrices of αid and αexp
, which can be
obtained from the pre-existing face model. (σ s
i )2 is the
variance of alignment error of the i-th landmark and is
obtained from a separate training set consisting 20 im-
ages with hand-labeled landmarks. Eq. (7) can be com-
puted efficiently, leading to the estimated identity weight
αid, with which we can compute the neutral-expression
model Si(= ¯Si(cid:31) + Aid
i(cid:31) αid).

where land(i,R j) is the pre-calculated mapping func-
tion that computes the position of landmarks i on the 3D
model when the orientation is R j. Ideally, the first equa-
tion in Eq. (6) should hold for all the landmark points
in all the images. However, this is not the case due to
the alignment error introduced by landmark extraction.
Generally, contour landmarks introduce more error than
