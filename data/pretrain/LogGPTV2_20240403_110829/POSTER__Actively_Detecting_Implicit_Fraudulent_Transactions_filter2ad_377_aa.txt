ABSTRACT
In this work, we propose to actively detect implicit fraudulent
transactions. A novel machine learning method is introduced to
distinguish anomalous electronic transactions based on the histor-
ical records. The transferor will be alerted during the on-going
payment when the fraud probability is recognized as large enough.
Compared with elaborative rule-based approaches, our model is
much more effective in fraud detection.

1 INTRODUCTION
Alipay, currently known as Ant Financial Services Group, is the
largest mobile and online platform and money-market fund all over
the world. In terms of the statistics information at the middle of
2016, there are more than 100 million daily active users and about
450 million annual active users1. However, there exist more than ten
thousands fraudulent transactions per day that cause great losses.
It is therefore a core component for the payment security of moni-
toring suspicious transactions. In general, fraudulent transactions
can be summarized into two different situations, i.e., judgement
afterwards and active detection on the fly.

In the first scenario, if a user has been aware of being cheated
and has accused to us, it is necessary to judge whether he (or she)
is in a fraud or not, in terms of the supporting proofs, transaction
details and the profile. The above is an explicit fraud judgement
after the incident has happened. In a secondary and more important
situation, we desire to actively detect such an implicit fraudulent
transaction before a user finishes transfering money into suspicious
persons.
We emphasize on active identification of the potentially implicit
fraudulent fraud at risk control strategy, in order to alert the trans-
feror as soon as the anomalous transaction is identified. Based on
our observations, we found that 1) fraudulent manners are changed
rapidly with new patterns and attacks, and 2) the number of fraud-
ulent transactions is much less than normal ones. To address the
problems, we propose a novel machine learning method, which is
automatically adaptive with constantly changing means of frauds
as time goes by.
2 RELATED WORK
Fraudulent transaction detection has been widely investigated in
the literature, e.g., credit card fraud, telecommunication fraud, and
etc. [3, 16]. Rule-based approaches are introduced to produce asser-
tion statement of IF {conditions} and THEN {a consequent} by [9, 15].
Brause et al. propose to generalize association rules by comparing
fraud and normal records [5], and [2] shows a way that generates
decision variables to identify potentially fraudulent calls. Super-
vised learning methods are presented in many literature, which
yield a fraud probability for the judgement of a new record. Linear
discriminative models are employed in [11], and neural networks
are utilized later [1, 10, 14].
As for extremely unbalanced data, several unsupervised methods
have been applied. Nigrini shows the effectiveness of the Benford’s
law in accounting fraud [13], and Bolton et al. describe unsuper-
vised profiling methods for the fraud detection of credit cards [4].
Aggregation strategies and clustering methods are used, instead of
the analysis targeting on a single transaction record. Vadoodparast
et al. combine three traditional clustering methods to achieve bet-
ter performance [17], and Casas et al. leverage k-means to group
network security data, whose centroids and labels are fed into a clas-
sifier [7]. Detailed aggregation strategies are shown for detecting
credit card fraud in [12, 18].

In this section, we will give the details of the proposed model.
3.1 The Main components
Figure 1: The trainer module of the proposed model.
Our model consists of two components, including trainer and
predictor modules. As illustrated in Figure 1, we first build a trans-
action network from the historical records, and then learn user
features using unsupervised learning. Finally, tree-based classifiers
are trained by labeled transactions. Once user features and classi-
fiers are ready, the predictor module of our model is able to yield
a fraud probability score to alert the transferor if necessary, as
described in Figure 2.
Figure 2: The predictor module of the proposed model.
The key of the task is to learn the topological feature information
of each user node in the transaction network and train robust
classifiers from unbalanced categories.
3.2 Learning User Features from Transaction
Network
Since the fraud patterns vary over time, we aim to extract the
useful features automatically. An electronic transaction involves
two different roles of users, i.e, transferor and transferee, where a
user is treated as a node and an edge exists if there is a transaction
between them.
Let us define G = as the transaction network, where V
is the collection of the nodes and E is the collection of the edges.
Given the network G, our goal is to learn a representational matrix
D (D ∈ |V | × d ), where the d-dimensional vector of the i-th row of
learned matrix denotes the topological feature information of the
i-th user node.
Intuitively, the most intimate nodes of a node are its (1-hop)
neighbours, and next initimate ones are 2-hop neighbours, and so

on. Motivated by [6], we define the loss function by measuring the
topological similarity between a node and its neighbours:
Ec′∼U [log σ (−⃗w · ⃗c′)]

where L1 is the loss function, and τ (w ) is the collection of neigh-
bours of w within a fixed number of hops. Ec′∼U [·] denotes the
expectation, where c′ follows the node distribution U . c′ is a nega-
tive sample that does not occur in the neighbours but is randomly
selected from the whole node collection V , and λ represents the
number of negative samples. ⃗w and ⃗c are the low dimensional repre-
sentational vectors of the node w and its neighbour node c. Besides,
σ is sigmoid function.
⃗w is randomly initialized at first and updated by the term of
