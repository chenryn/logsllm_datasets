User: How to read and process large CSV files using Python and Pandas library?
Assistant: Reading and processing large CSV files is easy with Python's Pandas library. Here are some basic steps: 1. Import Pandas library```python import pandas as pd``` 2. Read CSV file```python dataframe = pd.read_csv('path/to/csv/file.csv') ``` This code will read a CSV file named file.csv and store it in a Pandas dataframe dataframe. 3. Processing and Transforming Data Using the functions and methods available in Pandas dataframes, you can easily perform various data processing and transformation operations. Here are some examples: ```python # select certain columns selected_columns = dataframe[['Column1', 'Column2']] # filter data filtered_data = dataframe[dataframe['Column1'] > 10] # sort data sorted_data = dataframe .sort_values('Column1') # grouping and aggregation grouped_data = dataframe.groupby('Column1').sum() ``` etc. 4. Write to CSV file ```python selected_columns.to_csv('path/to/new/csv/file.csv', index=False) ``` This code writes the selected columns to a new file named newfile.csv CSV file. Using the Pandas library, you can easily read and process large CSV files for data preprocessing, cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
