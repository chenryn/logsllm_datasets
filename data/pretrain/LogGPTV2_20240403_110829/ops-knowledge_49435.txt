User: In a DOS .exe program (with no access to source code), the DOS screen says: rate = 60. (or some other value).
How do I read the output "60" to use as input to an application I'm making in Python or C/C++,
other than by reading and typing it (I want to run it dozens of times).
This program runs in Windows XP mode.
Assistant: You can use pipe.
prgm.exe | anotherprogram.exe
Just remember that the anotherprogram will get the whole output of prgm.exe
