ular nameservers. Thus, in this experiment, the new nameservers
becoming visible by increasing the sample size are likely unpopular,
carrying diminishing amounts of DNS traffic. In other words, the
big nameservers are already well visible through a small set of re-
solvers, smaller than what we used for this paper. We demonstrate
this in Figure 4b), where we plot the fraction of an hourly Top-10K
nameserver list visible using subsets of our resolver pool: even a
5% sample is enough to see 95% of the list.
In Figure 4c), we present a similar experiment where we plot
the number of Top-Level Domains seen in 1 hour as a function of
the fraction of recursive resolvers used for monitoring the DNS.
Although there are over 1,500 TLDs existing in the DNS [37], we
stress not all of them are actively used on the Internet, hence the
limit of 1,150 TLDs that our curves converge to. Adding the re-
solvers from the other SIE channels (red curve) does not bring us
much more coverage, which suggests DNS Observatory already
has decent visibility into various TLDs.
Next, in a similar manner as above, we validate that the other re-
sults presented in this paper—concerning the response delays, num-
ber of router hops, QTYPEs, TTLs and their estimated probabilities—
all converge to the reported values as we increase the fraction of
used vantage points (we skip the plots for brevity).
Finally, although we deliberately avoided tracking less popular
nameservers in the DNS, we want to better understand our data and
what we skipped in it. In Figure 5, we plot the number of all seen
nameserver IP addresses as a function of monitoring time. That is,
here we use all vantage points, and in each step we increase by 1h
for how long we continuously record the raw traffic. In total, over
3 days (instead of 1 hour used above), we observed 1.5M unique
IPs of authoritative nameservers in active use. The IPv4 addresses
were contained within 405 k /24 prefixes, yet 48 % of these observed
prefixes had only 1 address, 24 % had 2 addresses, and 7.7 % had 3
addresses. This means that the less popular nameservers that we
intentionally skipped in subsection 3.2 are actually well distributed
on the IP addressing space. For completeness, we visualize this with
a heatmap in Figure 6.
DNS Observatory is an ongoing project aimed at gaining a bird’s-
eye view on the DNS. In this work, we evaluate our novel system
using only the main SIE passive DNS channel, due to limited pro-
cessing bandwidth. More work is planned in the near future to
ingest all of the SIE passive DNS channels, which will improve data
coverage in terms of resolver count and their geographical locations.
Due to confidentiality agreements with the SIE data contributors
(our data comes from a strict security context) we must not disclose
their identities or locations. However, note that access to SIE is
available to other researchers via data sharing and through a re-
search grant program, which allows for independent verification
of our results [19, 21, 24].
4 UNDERSTANDING THE DNS TTL
DNS responses are accompanied by a TTL value, which is a 32 bit
field that sets an upper bound on how long a resource record can
be kept in the cache [47]. Previous studies have shown the role of
caching in DNS resilience against DDoS attacks [48, 52]. In addition,
there have been evaluations on the effectiveness of caching and its
performance implications [41] and efforts to build models for TTL
caches [40] (see section 6).
In the following, (1) we analyze the effect of TTL changes on
traffic between recursive and authoritative nameservers and (2)
we assess the feasibility of leveraging TTL information to detect
upcoming DNS infrastructure changes.
4.1 How TTLs affect traffic volumes?
The duration for how long a record can be cached—determined
by its TTL—influences the number of queries. Below, we put the
notion of a TTL decrease leading to a query increase to the test.
We evaluate SLD data from March and April 2019 to find large
TTL changes between these two months. In Figure 7, we depict
the case of the xmsecu.com SLD, which slashed its TTL from 10
minutes to 10 seconds on April 4, 2019. This domain provides a
web interface for infamous Xiongmai video surveillance devices,

increasing sample of recursive resolvers (average for 20 repetitions); b) fraction of Top-1K nameservers seen in 1 hour; c)

which were hacked by the Mirai botnet [66]. In addition to their
involuntary participation in DDoS botnets, they seem to voluntarily
put an additional load on the TLD nameservers. This SLD shows a
clear relation between TTL decrease and DNS query increase.
In Figure 8, we depict the top 100 SLDs by traffic change between
March and April 2019. Intuitively, the majority of TTL decreases
on the left side of the plot lead to an increase in traffic. With some
exceptions, we see an almost inverse linear correlation between
TTL and DNS traffic changes.
On the right side of Figure 8, the case is not as clear cut. Even
though we see quite a few cases of query rate decreases which
could be correlated to DNS TTL changes, there are twice as many
SLDs with increased (34 cases) than decreased traffic (17 cases)
even though their TTL goes up. We investigate these seemingly
inconsistent cases and find that 28 of the 34 cases only increase their
query rate, but not their response rate, i.e., resolvers are increasingly
querying for non-existent FQDNs or issuing otherwise unusual
queries.

IPv4 addresses of authoritative nameservers (produced us-
ing [68]). Each pixel corresponds to a /24 prefix. The blue
color means 1 address in given prefix used as a nameserver
during a 3-day time window.
To summarize, we find that for the most part TTLs directly influ-
ence query rates, as caching a name for a shorter duration leads to
more queries. We detect inconsistent behavior by many SLDs with
an increased TTL, which can be attributed to NXDOMAIN queries,
or simply the domain becoming more popular in the meantime.

reports.

4.2 Can TTL changes indicate changes in DNS
infrastructure?
While there is no consensus on how to choose TTL values for
different types of resource records—e.g., CDNs are known for using
values in the range of minutes, while for the root zone it is of the
order of days—operators decrease TTL values of records before
carrying out changes in its associated infrastructure [43].
For example, consider the domain name example.org, which has
two nameservers [a,b].iana-servers.net with a TTL of 86400s
(1 day). Now lets assume its operator decides to change the DNS
provider, and use different NS records of ns[a,b].example.org.
Before carrying out this change, the operator of example.org may
reduce the TTL of its NS records from 1 day to, e.g., 30s, and only
then update the NS records—i.e., after waiting a time interval long
enough so that the previously cached records expire at all resolvers.
Any potential issues with the change can be resolved by quickly
reverting to the “old” NS records. Once the operation is successfully
performed, the operator may then increase the TTL values of the
4.2.1 Methodology. We use the aafqdn dataset described in sub-
section 3.1. We collect only the NoError responses that either have
a non-empty ANSWER section or contain NS records in the AU-
THORITY section (or both). Note that a DNS response may be
composed of up to three sections: answer , authority, and additional
sections [47]. Moreover, we consider only the responses that come
from authoritative nameservers—i.e., from child delegations—which
have the AA flag set. Each hour, we produce a data file with Top-10K
FQDNs, as described in subsection 2.4.
We analyze consecutive hourly files from April 19th until 25th,
2019. For each FQDN, we analyze the TTL distribution of its A
and NS records, and detect changes in these values. We classify a
change in TTL values if at least 10% of the DNS responses for the
particular hour show new values. Notice that the top list of each
hourly file may differ, given they are dictated by how popular the
FQDNs were on that specific hour, due to user interest and diurnal
patterns [55].
For the aforementioned period, we found 65 domains with signif-
icant TTL changes in their records. We classify them into categories
in Table 4. In order to better understand the changes detected using
DNS Observatory, we manually lookup the FQDNs in DNSDB [18],
which provides a more detailed, historical record of the DNS.
4.2.2 Analysis. Table 4 shows the results of our classification. The
most common category is non-conforming authoritative name
servers returning variable TTLs for the same domain in subsequent
queries. For example, the authoritative server dns.widhost.net is
authoritative for dns2.vicovoip.it, and when asked directly for its A
record, answers with decreasing TTL values (<1024). While these
TTL changes do not indicate changes in the infrastructure of the
domain name (thus misguiding our detection), it indicates that some
domains do not conform to the standard behavior of returning the
same TTL values unless there are zone file updates.
Another common category found associated with TTL changes
are renumbering events, i.e., changing either A or AAAA records
of domains. We can see that ns2.oh-isp.com was renumbered to
52.166.106.97. Checking whois, we see the new A record belongs
to Microsoft, suggesting that this DNS server is now hosted in a
cloud and—when the change was completed—the TTL increased
from 600s to 38400s.
We also saw four changes in TTL not associated with any change
in DNS infrastructure (TTL Decrease/Increase in Table 4). These
events show simple increase or decrease of TTLs for domains, and
not necessarily renumbering or changes in NS records.
Moreover, our method allows to spot domains that change NS
and A records at the same time (Change NS), which were accom-
panied by TTL reductions from 600 to 10s. We could not, however,
classify 21 changes given there was not enough data in DNSDB to
understand these results.
Overall, our method allows us to detect various types of changes
to the DNS infrastructure, or domains that have non-conforming
responses. Given that DNS Observatory covers the DNS beyond
SLDs, it can be used to track changes to domains at any level of the
DNS hierarchy. Thus, we confirm the changes of TTLs can be used
