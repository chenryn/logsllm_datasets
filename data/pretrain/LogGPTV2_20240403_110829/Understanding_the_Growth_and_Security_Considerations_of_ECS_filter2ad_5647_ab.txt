ECS related IP preﬁx of the client. When, in this case, the
authority is on a different path, signiﬁed by the red line in
Figure 3, all the hops will receive the unencrypted ECS IP
preﬁx of the client. This ties back to point (1) where even when
the authoritative is in the same AS as the web server (e.g., as
Fig. 2: Legacy DNS network topology. Typically, recursion took place
in the user’s own autonomous system, and authorities were often
situated in the same AS as the web server. Both DNS and HTTP
trafﬁc followed the same network path.
Fig. 3: Modern DNS network topology. Increasingly, clients query a
“cloud DNS” host or open resolver situated at a different autonomous
system, and modern web sites frequently outsource DNS management
to third-parties. Due to the inclusion of ECS information in DNS
requests, a fraction of autonomous systems that would otherwise be
unrelated to the path between the user and the actual web server are
now in a position to gain client-speciﬁc information about browsing
(or other) activity.
What changes with the adoption of ECS is the information
contained in the communications above the recursive, which
is shown in steps (2) to (7) in ﬁgure 1. The steps are still the
same; the main difference is that when the recursive resolver
and the authoritative DNS servers support ECS,
the DNS
packet contains the extra information to help the authority
identify the user’s broad geographic location. This change
has come about due to the changing landscape in how DNS
resolutions are performed nowadays. The rise of open recursive
DNS servers, which are typically situated in separated ASes
than the users (as shown in Figure 3), disrupts the optimal
delivery of content (e.g., as performed by CDNs), which
previously assumed users were proximate to their resolvers.
When a user resolves the name of a CDN-enabled web site,
the authority DNS server would respond with a web server
address close to the recursive, instead of the actual user. Thus, a
North American user relying on a European DNS server could
be directed to a non-local CDN mirror, slowing the resulting
TCP connection.
ECS attempts to address this issue by including a truncated
portion of the client’s IP address, referred to as the source
netmask, in all subsequent requests made by the recursive to
an authority supporting ECS. An authority usually indicates
that it supports ECS by including a scope netmask in reply
to an ECS enabled query. On the other hand, some recursive
resolvers send ECS enabled queries to all authorities. This
added user information allows selecting a mirror that is in
close proximity to the actual user, not just their cloud recursive.
According to the ECS protocol [15], the source netmask should

web server will be different than the path from the third-party
open DNS resolver (e.g., Google’s 8.8.8.8) to the web server.
More importantly, regarding (2), due to the increasing reliance
on third-party DNS hosting services (e.g., No-IP, EveryDNS,
EasyDNS, Afraid, Zoneedit, Cloudﬂare), the path between the
recursive and the authoritative may be completely different
than the path between the user and the web server, as shown
in Figure 3.
As shown in section IV, it appears there is signiﬁcant mis-
use of ECS in the Internet. While, in many cases, this may pose
no privacy concerns, in others, the users’ anonymity may be
seriously jeopardized. For example, Kintis et al. [27] discussed
how this information could enable highly stealthy and targeted
man-in-the-middle and surveillance attacks against dissidents,
minorities, and even entire industry sectors.
In any case, it cannot be denied that users can indeed ben-
eﬁt from ECS, however, its correct and absolutely necessary
deployment is paramount in order to minimize the possibility
of privacy leakage.
III. METHODOLOGY
In this section, we study the adoption of the ECS pro-
tocol by recursives from three different vantage points and
investigate the client information sharing due to ECS from the
perspective of an authority (i.e., what additional client-related
information ECS shares with authorities) and its applications.
We ﬁrst describe the datasets and provide statistics about the
observed legacy and ECS enabled requests throughout our
different collection sources. Then, we show that
the ECS
protocol is widely adopted across our sources and constitutes a
signiﬁcant percentage of the DNS trafﬁc. Next, we demonstrate
how the ECS enabled trafﬁc can be utilized to provide a view
of the clients behind the ECS enabled recursives that make the
DNS queries to the authoritative servers through a sinkhole
authority case study.
A. Datasets
Top Level Domain (TLD): This historical dataset consists
of queries to popular Top-Level Domain (TLD) zones. The
DNS queries for this dataset span one year, from July 2014 to
July 2015, beginning just before the wide adoption of ECS.
This source gives us a coherent view into the ﬁrst years of the
ECS adoption and shortly before the release of the RFC (RFC
7871 [15]) in 2016.
DNS Zones: This passive DNS dataset consists of DNS trafﬁc
to authoritative DNS servers for several popular zones. The
data from this authority ranges from March 2017 to June 2019.
It contains DNS trafﬁc for 9.8 Million unique IPs. We are
utilizing this dataset to get a coherent view of ECS adoption
after the ofﬁcial release of the RFC.
Sinkhole: Our sinkhole passive DNS data consists of a total
of 24 sinkholed domain names related to targeted attacks from
Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) and typosquatting [6],
[44] and combosquatting [28]. When users visit these sink-
holed domains, as a result of social engineering or a typo-
graphical error when typing the domain name in the browser,
our domain names get resolved and we record the resolution
process.

we collected.

ISP DNS dataset: This dataset was collected by a large ISP
(top 10) in North America over the ﬁrst ﬁve days of April 2019.
This ISP provides services over the entire North American
region and provides us with real-world information about the
state of ECS and its usage. We use this dataset in section
IV-D to provide us with more insight into the beneﬁts that
ECS enabled domains obtain by adopting the protocol.
Alexa: Finally, we use the list of the most popular domains
compiled by Amazon’s Alexa. We use this dataset to help
identify popular domains on the internet and examine their
support for ECS and how they might beneﬁt, or not, from
supporting ECS.
Table I provides a detailed view of the ﬁrst three aforemen-
tioned datasets, the size for each one, and the time period they
cover. At this point, we should note that the TLD authority data
is approximately 1.5 years older than the Zones and Sinkhole
datasets. Even though this could seem inconsistent at ﬁrst,
our results will demonstrate the statistical signiﬁcance of our
measurements, even though time periods might not overlap.
Moreover, obtaining contiguous datasets of such large volume
and different time periods is particularly difﬁcult. However,
we chose to use all three datasets in our study to paint a
clear and longitudinal picture of the different ECS uses and
changes from the very early adoption days until recently. The
fourth dataset, the ISP DNS dataset is used to provide our
study insights into the beneﬁcial aspects of the adoption of
ECS such as it’s utilization from CDN providers.
B. Identifying ECS in Our Datasets
Figure 4 shows the volume of ECS-enabled and legacy
DNS resolution requests for the TLD and the DNS Zones
authorities. We observe that in both authorities the vast ma-
jority of the DNS requests are non ECS-enabled. In the TLD
authority dataset, which goes back to July 2014, we observe
no ECS-enabled queries until mid-August 2014. We spot the
ﬁrst noticeable volume of ECS-enabled queries on August 20
2014, with a total of 2.6 million queries from 95 different
recursives, all of which can be traced back to Google by using
the Route Views [45] BGP announcement project database.
ECS-enabled trafﬁc constitutes about 0.2% of the daily TLD
trafﬁc in 2014-2015, featuring an increasing trend over time.
After the adoption of the ECS RFC, we notice that the ECS
enabled requests make up 30% of the daily DNS trafﬁc with
a mean of 295 million requests per day. This clearly indicates
the large growth after ECS was adopted as an RFC.
Our
sinkhole dataset
contains observations between
September 10, 2017, and June 20, 2019. On the ﬁrst day of
our experiment we had 11 domain names sinkholed. We kept
Fig. 4: The number of daily legacy and ECS-enabled DNS requests to the authorities. The non ECS-enabled requests constitute the majority
of the DNS requests. The dip in December 2017 in the DNS Zones authorities is a result of collection issues (missing data) on that period.

incorporating more and more domain names in our sinkhole,
reaching a maximum of 24 domains. Figure 6 shows the
volume of ECS-enabled and normal DNS resolution requests.
Contrary to the previous two datasets, we observe that the
ECS enabled requests constitute the majority of the trafﬁc
to our sinkhole authority while the daily query volume is
unsurprisingly orders of magnitude smaller than that of the
other two authorities. In total, we saw 11.5 billion DNS
requests from which 69% were ECS enabled.
By looking at the IPs of the recursives making the DNS
requests at the TLD and DNS Zones authority in Figure 5, we
initially observe that the vast majority of the recursives that
query the authorities do not use ECS. The ECS requests come
from a small number of recursives that increased from less
than 100 in the ﬁrst months of ECS-enabled trafﬁc in 2014 to
more than 1,000 in 2017-2019. Figure 7 shows a similar trend
for the recursives at the sinkhole authority. The ASes that host
ECS-enabled recursives are predominately owned by Google
in the tune of 1,579 (85%) , 2,444 (46%) and 500 (78%)
of the recursives for the sinkhole, DNS Zones and the TLD
authorities. Likewise, Google’s recursives handle the majority
of the ECS enabled trafﬁc, as shown in Table II, which shows
that in all of the authorities Google handles the vast majority
of the ECS trafﬁc.
IV. MEASURING ECS IN THE REAL WORLD
the goal of examining whether its use is justiﬁed. We will
also present a study of sinkholed domains and how the use
of ECS can provide us with information about the clients
connecting to our sinkhole. To begin, we investigate the privacy
preservation claims in the ECS RFC [15] with respect to
the length of the source netmask (Section IV-A), and show
that the preﬁxes suggested for ECS do not necessarily reﬂect
the reality, in terms of routing on the Internet, where the
vast majority (50%) of preﬁxes have the same /24 that ECS
recommends. Second, in Section IV-B, we revisit prior work
by measuring the deployment and distribution of ECS-enabled
resolvers and identify steady growth in the adoption rate of
ECS across both popular and less popular sites. Third, we
examine various properties of the observed ECS speakers.
We show that over the years, more and more domains have
opted to support ECS, even though many ECS speakers do
not appear to represent content delivery networks, the very
technology ECS is meant to assist. In fact, the majority of
ECS-enabled domains (80%) do not exhibit any kind of CDN
behavior. (Section IV-D). Lastly, in Section IV-E, we show that
not only ECS-enabled domains do not exhibit CDN behavior
, but also utilize outsourced and managed DNS services
by commercial providers. These services reside in different
autonomous systems (AS), and anyone else on the DNS path
is positioned to collect client-speciﬁc information (through the
ECS client netmask) that would be otherwise unavailable to
them if not for ECS.
In the previous section, we presented the state of ECS
adoption as can be observed through passive measurements.
In this section, we will present a measurement study of the
real-world deployment of ECS among popular websites, with
