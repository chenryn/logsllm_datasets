I am experiencing an issue when attempting to update an entity that contains over 250 fields in a form. The form uses a basic Twig template and does not employ any assert validators.

**Environment: PHP 5.4**
- **Symfony 2.1**: The form submission completes successfully within 1-2 seconds.
- **Symfony 2.2 or 2.3**: The form submission results in a "maximum execution time" error. Upon further investigation, I discovered that the process takes approximately 17 minutes.

**Environment: PHP 5.3**
- **Symfony 2.1, 2.2, or 2.3**: The form is submitted successfully within 1-2 seconds, without any issues.

This discrepancy in performance between different versions of Symfony and PHP is causing significant delays and errors in the form submission process.
