I have a problem to update an entity which have more than 250 fields in a
form. No assert validator, and a basic template twig.
On PHP 5.4:  
In SF2.1, no problem, I sumbit the form, it takes 1-2 seconds to do that.  
In SF2.2 or 2.3, I have a "maximum execution time" error ! I try to modify the
value and I found it takes about 17 minutes !!!!!
On PHP 5.3:  
No problem, the form is submitted in 1-2 seconds with SF 2.1, 2.2 or 2.3
