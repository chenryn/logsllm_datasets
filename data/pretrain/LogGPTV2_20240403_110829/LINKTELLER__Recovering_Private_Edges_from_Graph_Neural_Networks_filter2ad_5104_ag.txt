### A. Datasets and Models

We use the datasets described in Section V-A. The differentially private (DP) GCN models are derived using DP mechanisms such as EDGERAND and LAPGRAPH under various privacy guarantees. For each privacy budget ε, we follow the procedure outlined in Algorithm 2 to obtain a perturbed copy of the adjacency matrix and then train a GCN on the perturbed graph. We adhere to the criteria in Section V-B for parameter searching and model training, with additional details provided in Appendix F4.

### B. DP GCN against LINKTELLER

#### 1. Experimental Setup

We evaluate the effectiveness of LINKTELLER on DP GCNs using the same setup as in Section V-D. Similar to Section V-E, we use precision and recall to measure the attack's success. For each dataset, we consider all combinations of:
- 2 DP mechanisms (EDGERAND and LAPGRAPH)
- 10 privacy budgets (1.0, 2.0, ..., 10.0)
- 3 sampling strategies (low, unconstrained, and high degree)
- 5 density beliefs (k/4, k/2, k, 2k, 4k)

The results for each scenario are averaged over 3 runs with different random seeds for sampling.

#### 2. Evaluation Results

The full evaluation results for all scenarios are provided in Appendix G4. Here, we focus on the density belief ˆk = k. In Figure 3(b), we plot the F1 score of the attack with respect to the DP budget ε. We observe that the effectiveness of LINKTELLER decreases as the privacy budget ε decreases. Specifically, the F1 score approaches zero when ε is small, indicating strong protection. However, when ε is large, the protection offered by DP is limited, and LINKTELLER can achieve a success rate close to that of attacking non-private baselines.

We also note that the node degree distribution affects the performance of LINKTELLER. As the node degree increases, the attack success rate increases significantly. This suggests that DP provides better protection for low-degree nodes than for high-degree nodes. This is because the perturbations in the adjacency matrix, as designed by EDGERAND and LAPGRAPH, are independent across cells, making low-degree nodes more susceptible to the influence and thus better protected.

### C. Model Utility Given DP Protection

We evaluate the impact of applying DP (using EDGERAND and LAPGRAPH) on the utility of GCN models. We compare the results with two baseline models:
- A non-private vanilla GCN model
- A "perfectly" private MLP baseline

We use the F1 score of the rare class to evaluate the utility of all four models. This evaluation not only complements the DP-GCN evaluation but also provides insights into the tradeoff between model utility and robustness against the LINKTELLER attack.
