**Current behavior**  
Date pipe keeps the order of date components when using a custom format.
According to the docs
(https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/api/common/index/DatePipe-pipe.html) this
shouldn't be the case: 'In javascript, only the components specified will be
respected (not the ordering, punctuations, ...) and details of the formatting
will be dependent on the locale.'
**Expected behavior**  
The date pipe should ignore ordering and whitespaces etc, it should only care
about the date components and format the output date according to the locale.

**What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**  
To be able to use custom date formats.
