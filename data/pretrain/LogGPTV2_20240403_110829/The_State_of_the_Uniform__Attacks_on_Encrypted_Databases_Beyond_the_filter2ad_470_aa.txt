Abstract—Recent foundational work on leakage-abuse attacks
on encrypted databases has broadened our understanding of
what an adversary can accomplish with a standard leakage
proﬁle. Nevertheless, all known value reconstruction attacks
succeed under strong assumptions that may not hold in the real
world. The most prevalent assumption is that queries are issued
uniformly at random by the client. We present the ﬁrst value
reconstruction attacks that succeed without any knowledge about
the query or data distribution. Our approach uses the search-
pattern leakage, which exists in all known structured encryption
schemes but has not been fully exploited so far. At the core
of our method lies a support size estimator, a technique that
utilizes the repetition of search tokens with the same response to
estimate distances between encrypted values without any assump-
tions about the underlying distribution. We develop distribution-
agnostic reconstruction attacks for both range queries and k-
nearest-neighbor (k-NN) queries based on information extracted
from the search-pattern leakage. Our new range attack follows
a different algorithmic approach than state-of-the-art attacks,
which are ﬁne-tuned to succeed under the uniformly distributed
queries. Instead, we reconstruct plaintext values under a variety
of skewed query distributions and even outperform the accuracy
of previous approaches under the uniform query distribution.
Our new k-NN attack succeeds with far fewer samples than
previous attacks and scales to much larger values of k. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our attacks by experimentally
testing them on a wide range of query distributions and database
densities, both unknown to the adversary.
I. INTRODUCTION
In searchable encryption [15], [31], [41], a client encrypts a
privacy-sensitive data collection and outsources an encrypted
database to a server that can efﬁciently answer search queries
without ever decrypting the database. Known constructions
handle rich and expressive queries [17], [22] under the
deﬁnitional framework of structured encryption (STE) [13].
For an overview of the area, see the survey by Fuller et al. [23].
To strike a balance between efﬁciency and privacy, structured
encryption schemes reveal, by design, certain information
about the query and its corresponding response—this is the
so-called leakage. Despite cryptographic proofs guaranteeing
that nothing more is leaked but what the designer allowed, the
implications of the legitimately leaked information have not
been fully grasped yet. The ﬁrst generation of leakage-based
attacks [8], [30], [45] focused on query reconstruction under
various assumptions. The next generation of attacks [27], [32],
[33], [34] supported plaintext value reconstruction by a server
answering expressive queries, e.g. range and k-NN, on a one-
dimensional database under strong assumptions about the query

and/or data distribution. In this paper, we take the next step
and demonstrate the ﬁrst efﬁcient reconstruction attacks for
range and k-NN queries where the adversary has no knowledge
about the query distribution or the underlying data.
A. Motivation and Approach
We overview the limitations of the four state-of-the-art
attacks supported by a theoretical analysis and experimental
evaluation [27], [32], [33], [34] and outline our new approach.
Uniform Query Distribution Assumption. The ﬁrst value
reconstruction attack for range queries was proposed by
Kellaris-Kollios-Nissim-O’Neil (KKNO) [32]. It assumes that
queries are issued uniformly at random. Lacharit´e-Minaud-
Paterson (LMP) [34] studied the same problem for the special
case of dense databases—this is a simpler problem since
reconstructing order is equivalent to reconstructing values.
The work by Grubbs-Lacharit´e-Minaud-Paterson (GLMP) [27]
gives three reconstruction attacks for range queries under
different assumptions: attacks GENERALIZEDKKNO and
APPROXVALUE assume
an underlying uniform query
distribution, extend the underlying ideas of KKNO, and
present a new analysis on the query complexity; attack
AOR-to-ADR does not assume uniform queries but assumes
that
the attacker knows both the query distribution and
an approximation of the data distribution. Kornaropoulos-
Papamanthou-Tamassia (KPT) [33] propose reconstruction
attacks for k-nearest neighbor queries under the uniform query

distribution. The above attacks, summarized in Table I, set the
foundations for understanding the implications of leakage but
only succeed under strong assumptions that potentially do not
hold in the real world, e.g., uniform query distribution. Thus,
the following question still remains open:
“Is it possible to devise attacks that reconstruct an approxi-
mation of the plaintext values without any knowledge about
the query distribution or the data distribution?”
Our work answers this question in the afﬁrmative and
presents reconstruction techniques that are query and data
distribution agnostic. The key to achieve such a generalization
lies in the search-pattern leakage which is revealed in all
known STE schemes [23] but has been overlooked so far. See
Figure 1 for an illustration of the quality of our reconstruction.
Fundamental Limitations of Current Range Attacks. A
natural approach for answering the above question would
be to extend existing algorithmic techniques to work for
arbitrary query distributions. To explore this possibility, we ﬁrst
give a high-level intuition of the range reconstruction attacks
KKNO, GENERALIZEDKKNO, and APPROXVALUE. Through
the access-pattern leakage, which appears in the vast majority
of STE schemes, the attacker can see which and how many
queries return a given encrypted record. Assume the attacker
knows the space of possible plaintext values, e.g., values
from 0 to 100 representing attribute age. If range queries are
generated uniformly, the attacker expects values in the middle
(e.g. age = 50) to be returned more often than values towards
the ends (e.g. age = 1). Formally, the reference probability of a
value v captures the likelihood that value v will be returned in
r∈Rv Pr[r], where Rv
a response to a query. It is deﬁned as
is the set of ranges containing v and Pr[r] is the probability
of querying range r. Reference probabilities can be easily
pre-computed by an attacker who knows the query distribution.
The reference probability of plaintext values for two query
distributions is shown with histograms in Figure 2(b). Given
enough queries, the attacker computes the frequency of each
encrypted value and ﬁnds the closest match of each frequency to
a pre-computed reference probability. Each matched reference
probability corresponds to a plaintext value which is returned
as the reconstructed value. This frequency-analysis works well
for the uniform query case because the reference probabilities
(blue histogram) vary signiﬁcantly over the universe of plaintext
values, therefore, one can accurately map the observed frequen-
cies to reference probabilities. However, there are fundamental
limitations when trying to extend this approach.

from 0 to 100, where the probability of query [a, b] is proportional to (N −
b + a)25. (b) Reference probabilities of plaintext values under the uniform
query distribution (blue histogram) and Span query distribution (red histogram).
Reconstructing the values of an encrypted database, shown with solid bars,
from their empirical reference probabilities, is easy under the uniform query
distribution but hard under the Span query distribution.
For instance consider the Span range query distribution,
inspired by a realistic behavior from a client that issues “short
ranges”, depicted as a heatmap in Figure 2(a), where the lower
boundary of the range is on the Y -axis, the upper boundary
is on the X-axis and the color of each square denotes the
probability of issuing this query. One can visually conﬁrm
that queries around the diagonal, i.e., queries with short span,
have brighter color, hence are more likely to be issued. The
reference probability for the Span query distribution is shown
with the red histogram in Figure 2(b). Note that the reference
probabilities of 60% of potential plaintext values differ by
−8, i.e., the middle part of the red histogram is
less than 10
almost ﬂat, and as a result, the adversary can not make an
accurate mapping from observed frequencies to reconstructed
plaintext values. Thus, the Span query distribution causes all
state-of-the-art attacks to fail.
More generally, one can deﬁne query distributions where
the reference probabilities are identical so no matter how many
queries are observed, the adversary cannot distinguish between
potential plaintext reconstructions in the information-theoretic
sense. Interestingly, the fact that frequency-based attacks fail
in “smooth” distributions is used as a form of mitigation by
Lacharit´e-Paterson [35], who introduce multiplicities in the
records and spread the frequency of among the copies. From
the above example we see that for range queries we need a
radically different reconstruction approach to generalize.
How Many Queries Return a Response? Taking a step
back to rethink reconstruction attacks, there is a piece of
information that has not been fully exploited to overcome the

uniform query assumption. This is the number of queries that
return a given response, r, among the possible range queries.
Let xr be the number of lower query boundaries that can
potentially return response r, and let yr be the number of upper
boundaries that can potentially return the same response, r.
The total number of queries that return response r is essentially
Nr = xr·yr, but more importantly, both xr and yr are distances
between consecutive encrypted values. Therefore if we know
Nr for all r we could set up a system of equations containing
xr and yr and retrieve the distances between all values in the
database, effectively computing the values themselves.
However, the exact values of Nr are not available. Our
main approach lies in estimating Nr using search-pattern
leakage (which is part of all known constructions [23]) and then
setting up carefully-crafted optimization problems to retrieve
an estimation of the underlying distances/values.
Harnessing Search-Pattern Leakage. The search-pattern
leakage reveals to the adversary if two encrypted queries, called
search tokens, are generated from the same query. Interestingly
none of the aforementioned state-of-the-art attacks [27], [32],
[33], [34] utilize the search-pattern leakage, considering it
harmless. We argue that this leakage can be instead exploited.
Suppose that 103 observed search tokens (not-necessarily
distinct) return response r. If these 103 tokens are the same, we
can make a probabilistic argument that there aren’t that many
queries that return r. On the contrary, if all 103 are distinct,
then there are clearly at least 103 queries, and likely more, that
return r. More formally, the problem of estimating the number
of unseen outcomes from the frequency of observed outcomes is
called support size estimation and it has a rich history [5], [24],
[44]. We use non-parametric support size estimation techniques
that make no assumptions about the underlying distribution
to re-think reconstruction algorithms for encrypted databases.
Our techniques reconstruct very accurately for the challenging
case of “smooth” query distributions due to the fact that our
attacks are based on the number of possible queries that return
a response, a quantity that can be estimated even under ﬂat
frequencies, as we demonstrate in our experiments.
B. Our Contributions
The inﬂuential work by Kellaris et al. [32] posed as a
challenging open problem the task of plaintext reconstruction
for query distributions beyond the uniform. Another open
problem from [32] is the task of plaintext reconstruction for
short range queries since, as the authors highlight, these queries
are “typically observed in practice”. In this work, we resolve
these open problems by utilizing both the search-pattern and
the access-pattern leakage for range and k-NN queries on one-
dimensional databases by introducing attacks that are agnostic
to the query and the data distribution.
• Handling Unknown Query Distributions. We ﬁrst de-
scribe how the adversary can achieve knowledge transfer from
statistics and learning theory to reconstruct encrypted databases.
By partitioning the multiset of observed token-response pairs
(t, r), the adversary can study each partition separately and
draw inferences about the number of possible tokens that
return r. We benchmark the state-of-the-art non-parametric
support size estimation techniques under various (unknown
to the adversary) query distributions. Our experiments indi-
cate that certain estimators are better under different query
distributions so we propose a new modular approach to pick
the best estimation for the sample in hand. We further derive
analytical expressions for known high-order non-parametric
estimators, which is of independent interest.
• A New Approach for Range Queries. Armed with
techniques for estimating the number of queries that return
a response, we develop a new machinery to approximately
reconstruct an encrypted database. On a high-level, each
estimation gives us information about two distances between
encrypted values. But these estimations are made independently
and with a different sample sizes. We propose an efﬁcient new
algorithm, AGNOSTIC-RECONSTRUCTION-RANGE, that is
based on an unconstrained convex optimization problem so as
to piece together the above independent estimations and output
estimated distances between consecutive values of the database.
Our modeling gives higher weight to estimations made after
observing a larger number of queries. We test our attack
under a variety of query distributions and database densities,
and show it achieves reconstructions with good accuracy.
Also, AGNOSTIC-RECONSTRUCTION-RANGE outperforms
GENERALIZEDKKNO for the majority of tested setups under
the uniform query distribution, which is noteworthy because
our algorithm is unaware of how the queries are issued and
GENERALIZEDKKNO is ﬁne-tuned for the uniform case.
• Revisiting k-NN Queries. For the problem of reconstruc-
tion from k-NN queries, we plug our support size estimators
into the KPT algorithm to derive an estimation of the length
of the Voronoi segments without relying on the uniform query
distribution. Even though in theory this direct application is
valid, due to the fact that for skewed query distributions the
estimations are less accurate than in the uniform case, our
initial experiments demonstrated that more often than not
the resulting collection of estimated lengths is not a Voronoi
diagram and thus KPT returns no reconstruction. To remedy
this problem, we propose a new and efﬁcient approach via
formulating a constrained convex optimization problem that
discovers the minimum distortion of the estimated lengths so
as to force the lengths to become a valid Voronoi diagram.
