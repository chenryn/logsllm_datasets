User: Hey all.  I'm a professional software developer here in Seattle, WA USA.  I program for/work in a Windows shop, but I've recently began considering contributing to an Open Source project, specifically one under the Python License (CNRI Python License).  
I realize that contacting a human resources representative where I work is the first step, but could any existing source forge contributors give me any advice?
Assistant: Apparently the answer is that there'll be no problem with it.  :)  Thanks for all the help, you guys!
