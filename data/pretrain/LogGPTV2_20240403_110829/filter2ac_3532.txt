title:blackhat:asia-22 Backdoor Investigation and Incident Response: From  Zero to Profit
Every day online gaming companies are breached, however, you don't often hear about how it occurred, even yes, it is most likely related to DDoS, but how the attacker found their way in, what were the IOCs, was it financially lucrative for them and more importantly how to help in the detection of such attacks. In this talk, we will discuss how we investigated an incident in an online gaming company where there was unauthorized access to the transactional database and the attacker modified the gaming transaction to win the game. We will discuss how the attack compromised the database without leaving explicit footprints, all while the company had just completed an enterprise upgrade of many of their security controls, and still failed to detect the existence of a backdoor file for at least 8 months. Our investigation revealed additional backdoored servers saving the company in multi-million losses per day.Motivated by this incident and other similar types of breaches seen in our daily research, we propose a new incident response and detection framework for the backdoor investigation. We will walk through how we apply this framework, attempting to identify, capture, and analyze additional unrevealed backdoor in the network and its attribution. We will demonstrate our framework, Backdoor Incident Response Matrix (BDIRM), and how it works to target and analyze the backdoor malware itself, backdoored server, and network, and finally how it exhibits different generalized and systematic backdoor detections.After this talk, we hope the audience can apply the BDIRM with different technical perspectives for everyday usage in DFIR and/or defensive exercises on top of any existing methodology, thereby carrying out more effective incident response and routine monitoring specific to stealthy and target attack back door threat.
