User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题windows security log - failure reason startswith %% Please help - do You have the list with descriptions of failure reasons eg. %%2313, %%2307... I've researched Net and nothing.. :(

Mainly I see it in ID 4625 in Windows security logs.

On http://www.ultimatewindowssecurity.com/securitylog/encyclopedia/event.aspx?eventid=4625 
we have only codes startswith 0xC... not %%....

Below we have log examle: http://forum.ultimatewindowssecurity.com/Topic87-168-1.aspx#bm450

Failure reason is value like %%.... - what does it mean and other like this?

Thank you in advance for your help!

Assistant: My take is that you won't know what those variables stand for if you don't have the source code. But why do you need to know though? You can have all text description in Event Viewer. Or if it's an exported file, ask whoever export it to export as full text.
