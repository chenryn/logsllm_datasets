### Analysis of Forum Content

#### Spam and SEO Manipulation
We identified that **Forums D and E** were heavily influenced by spam activities, primarily aimed at boosting SEO for specific spyware products. Users in these forums often posted either advertisements for the spyware tool or short, meaningless messages (e.g., "Hi," "Hello") in response to the initial user's ads. Given the high prevalence of such spam, we excluded these forums from our qualitative analysis of forum content (Sections 6 and 7).

#### Prevalence of IPS-Related Keywords
To efficiently understand the organic content in the three infidelity forums, we performed keyword-based searches using a small set of keywords: "spy," "monitor," "track," "hack," and "record" (Table 2). This initial assessment showed that keyword searches are insufficient for accurately identifying relevant threads, as some keywords can be used in multiple contexts. For example, "record" can refer to unauthorized recording or music recordings.

To quantify this, we assembled a human-labeled dataset of 750 threads sampled across each of the three non-spam forums and manually coded them for relevance to IPS. Using a regex-based labeling method, we flagged threads as relevant if any post within the thread contained one of the keywords. This approach achieved an AUC of 0.62, indicating a significant number of false negatives and false positives. Therefore, we did not rely on the regex-based approach for subsequent analyses but instead focused on the human-labeled data. The development of automated learning techniques for flagging IPS-relevant threads remains an area of future work.

| Keyword | Forum A (%) | Forum B (%) | Forum C (%) | Forum D (%) | Forum E (%) |
|---------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| spy     | 26.9        | 7.1         | 1.6         | 98.4        | 42.1        |
| monitor | 8.6         | 2.2         | 3.0         | 97.8        | 27.8        |
| track   | 13.4        | 5.4         | 8.8         | 25.7        | 30.0        |
| hack    | 3.7         | 1.1         | 2.3         | 1.1         | 4.1         |
| record  | 14.9        | 7.8         | 7.3         | 3.8         | 1.4         |
| Total   | 43.7        | 17.3        | 17.6        | 99.4        | 62.3        |

### Understanding Forum Content

Our data contain rich information on attackers' strategies, interactions, and stated goals embedded in the natural language of users' posts. Here, we describe our qualitative methods for analyzing the content within Forums A, B, and C.

#### Establishing Human Ratings for IPS Relevance
Our initial measurements showed that not all content on these forums is relevant to the discussion of IPS tactics. To focus our analysis, we established human ratings for whether a given thread was relevant to IPS. We randomly chose 30 threads (10 from each forum) and had three coders independently rate their relevance. A relevant thread should:
1. Discuss an intent to track, monitor, surveil, or otherwise compromise an intimate partner’s privacy.
2. Describe doing so via technology.

Inter-rater reliability showed agreement in 28 out of 30 threads (Fleiss’ kappa of 0.91 [34]). We then expanded our analysis to 750 threads (250 from each forum), finding that 78% of the sampled data within Forum A, 51% within Forum B, and 18% within Forum C were relevant to IPS. These figures align with expectations, as Forum A, dedicated to "investigative equipment," has the highest prevalence of IPS-related content, while Forum C, which focuses on general discussions of infidelity, has the lowest.

In total, 370 of the 750 randomly sampled threads were coded as IPS-relevant. We found no statistically significant correlations between thread viewership and IPS relevance in any forum, or any noteworthy patterns in seasonal, diurnal, or year-over-year posting activity within IPS-relevant data.

#### Understanding IPS-Relevant Content
We used open thematic coding to analyze the 370 IPS-relevant threads. Three researchers independently read through several threads and generated initial codes. We then met over multiple sessions to jointly develop a codebook. Through multiple rounds of iteration, we refined the codebook by applying it to additional data until we reached saturation and codebook stability. Our final codebook contained 29 codes clustered into two high-level categories: forum culture and tools and tactics (see Appendix A).

Once the codebook was finalized, three researchers divided up the remaining threads and coded them. Our research team stayed in close correspondence throughout the analysis, repeatedly meeting to discuss threads that were unclear at first pass. We also took steps to minimize the impact of repeated readings of detailed stories of IPS and violence on our team. Researchers were encouraged to take breaks where needed, to reach out to each other regularly to process what we were reading, and to practice self-care.

We report the themes that emerged from our analysis in Sections 6 and 7. We emphasize that our analyses are qualitative, and we do not report raw or percentage prevalence numbers for any of our themes, except where noted and appropriately tested via inter-rater reliability measurements.

### Forum Interactions

In this section, we provide a general overview of how users interact within these forums. We begin by discussing how users self-report finding these communities and what they seek within them. We then describe how communities respond to their requests, including instances of escalation and de-escalation.

#### How Users Find These Forums
Users described finding these forums through various means, such as basic Google queries related to infidelity and cheating, or trusted recommendations from professionals like therapists. For Forums A and B, users are often directed to these specific forums by moderators or users of other communities within their parent forum. For example, a moderator in Forum A posted:

> "I asked you to come here to click on the many threads and read information for yourself. There are pages and pages all about spying... This forum is a kind of archive where the information will be available for anyone to peruse at leisure. There is no need to wait. Look around!"

This reinforces that these discussions are a resource for anyone to browse. Forum A, in particular, hosts several 'resource threads' pinned at the top of the forum that provide primers for beginners.

#### Forum-Goers' Stated Goals
Once in the forum, most users make an initial post outlining a complex social situation, usually suspected or actualized infidelity, and ask the community for advice on what to do, such as "How can I forgive him?" or "How do I move on?" Most of these posts sought suggestions for next steps, such as confronting their intimate partner or seeking legal advice. The bulk of posts within Forum C followed this pattern, mimicking the advice-seeking observed broadly in forums for social support.

We also identified a different kind of request focused on technical support for intended or ongoing IPS, such as "How can I read my wife’s Facebook messages?" or "How do I use this spyware tool?" Many users contextualized their asks in a detailed narrative of their situation, including admissions of past IPS, most commonly by reading a partner’s text messages or emails. For example, consider this initial post from Forum B:

> "I caught my wife by reading her journal and emails. She does not know that I know, and I continue to monitor her email account. I don’t think she knows. I haven’t told a soul about this, so this is my release. I can elaborate..."

Not all users framed their interactions as requests; some shared unsolicited advice on working with certain IPS tools, often couched in a personal narrative and promoting the use of the tools. We consider these to be organic advertisements for these tools.

Overall, we identified three high-level goals for users seeking IPS-related advice:
1. **Investigation of a Partner’s Prior Activities**: Many users fixated on reading their partner’s emails or text messages.
2. **Continuous Monitoring of a Partner’s Current and Future Device Use**: Many were interested in real-time access to their partner’s devices to gain information such as live updates on their partner’s location and browsing history.
3. **Compromise of a Suspected Affair Partner’s Privacy**: Many posters expanded the target of their IPS to include a suspected affair partner, with the goal of identifying their personal information (e.g., name, address, or vehicle registration).

#### Community Escalations
Communities' responses to users' requests varied. While many responded with emotional support and advice on managing infidelity, a significant body of threads showed communities encouraging thread starters to pursue their current enactment of IPS or even to increase the severity of their attacks. We call this a pattern of escalation, where a user begins with a relatively benign request for information and, through interactions with one or more IPS promoters, is presented with ideas for enacting or increasing the severity of an IPS attack.

For example, in Forum B, a user began a thread asking for emotional support: "I can’t believe my relationship has come to this, but I need some advice. Recently I discovered a situation that I’m not sure how to perceive..." An hour later, a responder offered several actionable ways to invade their partner’s privacy:

> "There are several things you can do. Start by going into full snoop mode. Purchase a voice-activated recorder and put it in his car. Snoop his phone records. Place spyware on his computer. Snoop his emails and FB account."

As the thread starter shared more details, the same responder repeatedly suggested ways to enact IPS, such as:

> "A voice-activated recorder is cheap, $40 at Walmart. Stop bringing this up, and make him think everything is back to normal. Then, monitor him. Good luck."

To get a sense of the prevalence of this thread pattern, we conducted an additional qualitative coding effort over our human-labeled sampling of IPS-relevant posts. Three coders first coded a random set of 30 relevant threads (10 from each forum) for whether or not they showed a pattern of escalation. Inter-rater reliability showed substantial agreement between raters: out of the 30 posts, all 3 raters agreed on 25 posts, and the remaining 5 showed 2 out of 3 raters in agreement (Fleiss’s kappa of 0.77). We then split the remaining relevant threads among the three coders, finding that approximately one-third of relevant threads showed patterns of escalation (Table 1). This proportion remained the same in both forums explicitly focused on investigating suspected deception (A, B) and in more general support forums for those 'recovering' from infidelity (C).

#### Community De-Escalations
While escalations appeared with alarming prevalence, we also found instances of de-escalations, where the community deterred a user from conducting IPS. In many cases, responders reminded posters of the physical and mental impact of continuously performing IPS on a partner, noting that it undermines the trust required for recovery of a healthy intimate relationship. For example, in Forum A:

> "You’ve got to ask though, when do you stop snooping? That can’t be healthy for your relationship if you’re being insecure about everything."

De-escalating responders also pointed out that IPS may not help people achieve their goals and instead sabotage a relationship. For cases where IPS had already been enacted, they provided guidance on how to discontinue and rebuild trust.

### Tool-Based Attacks

- **Requiring Physical Access**:
  - Using a cellphone backup recovery tool on a partner’s device
  - Installing a keylogger on a partner’s device
  - Installing screen recording spyware on a partner’s device
  - Installing GPS trackers on a partner’s body or in their car
  - Installing audiovisual recorders in the car or the home

- **Not Requiring Physical Access**:
  - Leveraging features of a shared phone plan
  - Using shared cloud tools to access a partner’s personal data
