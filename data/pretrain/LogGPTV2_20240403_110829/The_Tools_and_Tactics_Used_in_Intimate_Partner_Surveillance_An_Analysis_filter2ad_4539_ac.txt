closely associated with that spyware tool, and posts either ads
for the tool or short, meaningless messages (“Hi,” “Hello”)
in response to the ﬁrst user’s ads. We found similar patterns
within Forum E. Having concluded that most activity on these
two forums was spam intended to inﬂate SEO for speciﬁc
spyware products, we excluded them from our qualitative
analysis of forum content (Sections 6, 7).
Prevalence of IPS-related keywords. To efﬁciently under-
stand the organic content in the three inﬁdelity forums, we
sought automated ways to identify only those threads that
were relevant to IPS. As a ﬁrst-cut assessment, we performed
keyword-based searches of the threads in our dataset using a
small set of keywords identiﬁed from prior work [6]: “spy”,
“monitor”, “track”, “hack” and “record” (Table 2).
This ﬁrst-cut assessment showed keyword searches are,
unsurprisingly, insufﬁcient for accurate discovery of relevant
threads: for example, the keyword ‘record’ may be used in
the context of recording someone without their consent, but
also in the context of music recordings. To quantify this, we
assembled a human-labeled dataset of 750 threads sampled
across each of the three non-spam forums and manually coded
for relevance to IPS (see Section 5 for detailed methods).
We then applied a regex-based labeling method that ﬂagged
threads as relevant if any post within the thread contained any
one of keywords in our seed set. Using our 750 human-labeled
threads as ground truth, this simple approach achieves an AUC
of 0.62, indicating it misses a large number of relevant threads
(false negatives) and contains a large number of irrelevant
threads (false positives).
As a result, we do not rely on the regex-based approach
for any of our subsequent analyses, but instead study the
posts human-labeled as ground truth. The development of
automated learning techniques that can efﬁciently ﬂag IPS-
relevant threads remains a tantalizing area of future work.

5 Understanding Forum Content
Our data contain rich information on attackers’ strategies, in-
teractions, and stated goals embedded in the natural language
of users’ posts. Here, we describe our qualitative methods for
analyzing the content within Forums A, B & C.
Establishing human ratings for IPS relevance. Our initial
measurements showed not all content on these forums is rele-
vant to the discussion of IPS tactics: for example, while 8 of
the top 10 threads by viewership on Forum B contained some
mention of ways to monitor an intimate partner, the other
two threads discussed contraception and women’s underwear.
Thus, to focus our analysis, we ﬁrst established human ratings
for whether or not a given thread was relevant to IPS.
We began by randomly choosing 30 threads, 10 from each
forum. Three coders independently rated whether each thread
was IPS-relevant. We stipulated that a relevant thread should
both (1) discuss an intent to track, monitor, surveil, or other-
wise compromise an intimate partner’s privacy; and (2) de-
scribe doing so via technology. Inter-rater reliability showed
agreement in 28/30 threads (Fleiss’ kappa of 0.91 [34]).
We then expanded our analysis to arrive at a set of IPS-
relevant threads for further study. We randomly sampled 750
threads (250 from each forum) that we split evenly among the
three coders. As reported in Table 1, we ultimately found 78%
of the sampled data within Forum A was relevant to IPS; 51%
within Forum B; and 18% within Forum C. These ﬁgures
are in line with expectations: Forum A, which is explicitly
dedicated to “investigative equipment”, has the highest preva-
lence of IPS-related content, while Forum C, which has a
more general focus on discussion of inﬁdelity, has the lowest.
In total, 370 of the 750 randomly sampled threads were
coded as IPS-relevant. We found no statistically signiﬁcant
correlations between thread viewership and IPS relevance in
any forum, or any noteworthy patterns in seasonal, diurnal, or
year-over-year posting activity within IPS-relevant data.
Understanding IPS-relevant content. We used open the-
matic coding [4] to make sense of the 370 IPS-relevant threads.
Three researchers independently read through several threads
and generated initial codes. We then met over multiple ses-
sions to jointly develop a codebook. Through multiple rounds
of iteration, we reﬁned the codebook by applying it to addi-
tional data until we reached saturation and codebook stability.
Our ﬁnal codebook contained 29 codes clustered into two
high-level categories: forum culture and tools and tactics
(see Appendix A). Once the codebook was ﬁnalized, three
researchers divided up the remaining threads and coded them.
Our research team stayed in close correspondence throughout
the analysis, repeatedly meeting to discuss threads that were
unclear at ﬁrst pass. We also took steps to minimize the impact
of repeated readings of detailed stories of IPS and violence on
our team. Researchers were encouraged to take breaks where
needed, to reach out to each other regularly to process what
we were reading, and to practice self-care.
We report the themes that emerged from our analysis in Sec-
tions 6 and 7. We emphasize that our analyses are qualitative:
thus, we do not report raw or percentage prevalence numbers
for any of our themes, except where noted and appropriately
tested via inter-rater reliability measurements.
6 Forum Interactions
In this section, we give a general overview of how users inter-
act within these forums. We begin by discussing how users
self-report ﬁnding these communities, and what they seek
within them. We then describe how communities respond to
their requests. We identify threads in which communities en-
courage users to conduct IPS, either by encouraging them to
carry out existing attacks, or by providing them with ideas for
attacks of increased severity—what we call escalation. We
also identify threads in which communities discourage users
from IPS at all, a pattern we call de-escalation.
How users ﬁnd these forums. In several threads in each
forum, users describe how and why they sought out these fo-
rums in the ﬁrst place. Many described locating the forum via
basic Google queries on topics related to inﬁdelity and cheat-
ing. In other posts, users reported discovering the site through
a trusted recommendation from a professional enlisted to help
them with their relationships, such as a therapist.
Our data also show that for Forums A and B, users are often
directed to these speciﬁc forums by moderators or users of
other communities within their parent forum. For example, a
moderator in Forum A posted in response to a thread starter:
“I asked you to come here to click on the many threads
and read information for yourself. There are pages and
pages all about spying . . . This forum is a kind of archive
where the information will be available for anyone to
peruse at leisure. There is no need to wait. Look around!”
Here, we see a forum moderator reinforce that these discus-
sions are a resource for anyone to browse. We discovered that
Forum A in particular hosts several ‘resource threads’ pinned
at the top of the forum that provide primers for beginners.
Forum-goers’ stated goals. Once in the forum, most users
make an initial post outlining a complex social situation,

usually suspected or actualized inﬁdelity, and ask the commu-
nity for advice on what to do, e.g. “How can I forgive him?” or
“How do I move on?” Most of these posts sought suggestions
from others for ‘next steps’, such as confronting their intimate
partner or seeking legal advice. The bulk of posts within Fo-
rum C followed this pattern, mimicking the advice-seeking
observed broadly in forums for social support [9, 20, 47].
We also identiﬁed a different kind of request focused on
technical support for intended or ongoing IPS, e.g. “How
can I read my wife’s Facebook messages?” or “How do I use
this spyware tool?” Many of these users contextualized their
asks in a detailed narrative of their situation that included an
admission of past IPS, most commonly by reading a partner’s
text messages or emails. For example, consider this initial
post, paraphrased from Forum B:
“I caught my wife by reading her journal and emails. She
does not know that I know, and I continue to monitor her
email account. I don’t think she knows. I haven’t told a
soul about this, so this is my release. I can elaborate...”
Not all users framed their interactions as requests, however;
a subset of thread starters within Forums A and B posted to
share unsolicited advice on working with certain IPS tools.
This advice was often couched in a personal narrative (e.g.
“Here’s how I tracked his Internet history after he deleted it”)
and usually promoted the use of the tools. We consider these
to be organic advertisements for these tools, the implications
of which are discussed in Section 8.
Overall, we identiﬁed three high-level goals for users who
sought IPS-related advice across these forums. Many users
ﬁxated on reading their partner’s emails or text messages, or
what we call (1) investigation of a partner’s prior activities.
Many were also interested in real-time access to their part-
ner’s devices, to gain information such as live updates on their
partner’s location and browsing history: in our view, these
attackers sought (2) continuous monitoring of a partner’s cur-
rent and future device use. Finally, we saw that many posters
expanded the target of their IPS to include a suspected affair
partner, with the goal of identifying their personal information
(e.g., name, address or vehicle registration). We use the term
affair partner here to mean the person involved in an affair
outside of the intimate relationship, occasionally referred to
as the ‘other’ man or woman, and we name this goal as a (3)
compromise of a suspected affair partner’s privacy.
Community escalations. Communities’ responses to users’
requests varied. As expected for online support forums, many
responded with emotional support and advice on manag-
ing inﬁdelity, including recommendations for looking after
users’ mental and physical health. In a signiﬁcant body of
threads, however, communities responded by encouraging
thread starters to pursue their current enactment of IPS, or
even to increase the severity of their attacks. We call this a
pattern of escalation: a situation in which a user begins with
a relatively benign request for information, and through in-
teractions with one or more IPS promoters is presented with
ideas for enacting or increasing the severity of an IPS attack.
Consider this example from Forum B. A user begins a
thread by asking for emotional support: “I can’t believe my
relationship has come to this, but I need some advice. Recently
I discovered a situation that I’m not sure how to perceive...”
An hour later, a responder offers several actionable ways for
the user to invade their partner’s privacy:
“There are several things you can do. Start by going into
full snoop mode. Purchase a voice activated recorder and
put it in his car. Snoop his phone records. Place spyware
on his computer. Snoop his emails and FB account.”
From there, a concerning dialogue unfolds. As the thread
starter shares more details of their story over follow-up posts,
the same responder repeatedly suggests ways to enact IPS,
for example by offering:
“A voice-activated recorder is cheap, $40 at Walmart.
Stop bringing this up, and make him think everything is
back to normal. Then, monitor him. Good luck.”
To get a sense of the prevalence of this thread pattern in
our corpus, we conducted an additional qualitative coding
effort over our human-labeled sampling of IPS-relevant posts.
Three coders ﬁrst coded a random set of 30 relevant threads
(10 from each forum) for whether or not they showed a pat-
tern of escalation. Inter-rater reliability showed substantial
agreement between raters: out of the 30 posts, all 3 raters
agreed on 25 posts, and the remaining 5 showed 2 out of 3
raters in agreement (Fleiss’s kappa of 0.77). We then split the
remaining relevant threads among the three coders, ﬁnding
that approximately one-third of relevant threads showed pat-
terns of escalation (Table 1). This proportion remained the
same in both forums explicitly focused on investigating sus-
pected deception (A, B), and in more general support forums
for those ‘recovering’ from inﬁdelity (C).
Community de-escalations. While escalations appeared
with alarming prevalence in our dataset, we also found a
handful of instances of the opposite: de-escalations, in which
the community deterred a user from conducting IPS.
In many of these cases, responders reminded posters of the
physical and mental impact of continuously performing IPS
on a partner. These responders saw that IPS directly under-
mined the trust required for recovery of a healthy intimate
relationship. As this example from Forum A shows:
“You’ve got to ask though, when do you stop snooping?
That can’t be healthy for your relationship if you’re being
insecure about everything.”
De-escalating responders also often pointed out that IPS
may not help people achieve their goals, and instead sabo-
tage a relationship. For cases where IPS had already been
