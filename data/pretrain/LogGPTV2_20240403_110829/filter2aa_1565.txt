Trends
• The data becomes assets for very large 
companies 
• Like anything on the internet removing it 
can be really hard, even if the company 
allows it, backups, and online copies might 
exist.
• Your personal data is valuable and you give 
it up for free

Advice and activism
• Public cloud and private clouds for business
• We should get private storage of all our 
data, and decide what to display on sites.
• Sites should be consumers of data we 
provide and own, not storage providers and 
consumer of it

more advice
• The DRM we all love to loathe today, as 
companies enforce draconicen rules upon 
what we lease from them, should in the 
future be exploited by us all to protect our 
“life sphere” and control the access for 
sites who wish to lease our content.

even more advice
• Social sites make their money off of us, off 
or our content, our sweat and our work. 
• Its time to take control back.
