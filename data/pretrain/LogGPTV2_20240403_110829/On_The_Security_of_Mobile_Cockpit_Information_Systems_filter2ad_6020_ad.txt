### 6. Evaluation of Existing MCIS Solutions

In this section, we evaluate three existing Mobile Cockpit Information Systems (MCIS), each consisting of an iOS app and a receiver: ForeFlight with the Appareo Stratus 2, Garmin Pilot with the Garmin GDL 39, and WingX Pro7 with the Sagetech Clarity.

#### 6.1 ForeFlight with the Appareo Stratus 2

ForeFlight is the most popular iOS aviation app. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has recently approved the use of ForeFlight as a Class 2 Electronic Flight Bag (EFB) on all Frontier Airlines flights [23]. ForeFlight is compatible with two models of UAT receivers, the first-generation Stratus and the Stratus 2, both manufactured by Appareo. The app requires a $74.99 per year subscription, which includes FAA aeronautical charts and various real-time weather products accessible when the device has an Internet connection. Our evaluation is based on version 5.6 of the ForeFlight app.

The Appareo Stratus 2 (Figure 2, left) is the second generation of the Stratus device. Both the first-generation Stratus and the Stratus 2 are designed to work exclusively with the ForeFlight app. The Stratus 2 costs $899 and includes a GPS receiver, 1090ES receiver, UAT receiver, and an Attitude and Heading Reference System (AHRS) module. The Stratus 2 communicates with the iPad via Wi-Fi in infrastructure mode, acting as an access point. The user must configure the iPad to connect to this access point for the ForeFlight app to receive data from the unit. Our Stratus 2 was running firmware version 1.3.0.389.

**6.1.1 Receiver to App Channel Integrity**

The Stratus 2 receiver sends information to the app via UDP broadcast on its Wi-Fi network. All data is transmitted unencrypted and unauthenticated using a proprietary but easily reverse-engineered protocol. The ForeFlight app verifies communication with the Stratus 2 by checking the SSID and IP address subnet assigned by the access point. We were able to impersonate the receiver and inject arbitrary information, which the app accepted and displayed. Additionally, we could concurrently connect a malicious device to the Stratus 2 and broadcast data to the same broadcast address used by the Stratus 2 itself; the Stratus 2 (acting as an access point) relayed our forged data to the iPad. This behavior can be exploited by a malicious app to inject spoofed packets into the receiver-to-app channel. With this attack, the iPad receives both legitimate and forged data. However, because the user interface updates at fixed intervals, an attacker sending forged messages immediately after the Stratus 2 will cause the app to overwrite the correct data.

**Vulnerability:** An attacker with time-of-use proximity or collocated app capability can manipulate all receiver-originated data.

**6.1.2 App to Receiver Channel Integrity**

The reverse channel, from app to receiver, is also neither encrypted nor authenticated. The app (and, therefore, the attacker) can adjust the 802.11 transmitter power level and indicator LED brightness.

**Vulnerability (minor):** An attacker with time-of-use proximity or collocated app capability can modify some receiver settings.

**6.1.3 EFB Data Integrity**

The ForeFlight app downloads subscription data using an SSL connection. The app does not accept self-signed certificates. We were unable to tamper with this data.

**6.1.4 Receiver Integrity**

Receiver firmware can be updated using the ForeFlight app when connected to the Stratus 2. The firmware is packaged with the app and updated alongside it. Although it is possible to extract the firmware from the app bundle and capture it during an update, the firmware image itself is encrypted or scrambled, which we failed to break with a modest reverse-engineering effort.

**Vulnerability:** An attacker with brief proximity or collocated app capability can downgrade receiver firmware.

#### 6.2 Garmin Pilot with the Garmin GDL 39

The Garmin Pilot app provides features similar to ForeFlight and interoperates with the Garmin GDL 39 receiver and Garmin GLO GPS-only receiver. Garmin Pilot requires a $75 subscription. We evaluated Garmin Pilot version 6.0.1.

The GDL 39 receiver costs $599 and includes a GPS receiver, 1090ES receiver, and UAT receiver. A more expensive model, the GDL 39 3D, also includes an AHRS module. Unlike the Stratus 2 or the Clarity, the GDL 39 communicates with the iPad using Bluetooth. The Bluetooth link uses RFCOMM, which provides RS-232 emulation over a Bluetooth link. Our unit had firmware version 2.80.

**6.2.1 Receiver to App Channel Integrity**

When the Garmin Pilot app connects to the receiver, the two devices engage in a handshake. The receiver sends a nonce and a key to the app; the app then encrypts the nonce with a 16-round Blowfish cipher and the key, and then encrypts a static message with the output of the first cipher as a key to an 11-round Blowfish cipher. We suspect that this unusual algorithm is meant to mutually authenticate the app and receiver. The code to carry out this process is included in the app and the receiver firmware image; it was extracted by a hobbyist and posted online. We did not attempt receiver-to-application attacks; however, we believe it is possible to impersonate the receiver (requires time-of-use proximity).

**6.2.2 App to Receiver Channel Integrity**

We were able to passively listen on this channel using a script written by the aforementioned hobbyist and to spoof requests from the app to the receiver. We were also able to determine the address of the GDL 39 wirelessly via sniffing and then connect to the device without pairing.

**6.2.3 EFB Data Integrity**

The Garmin Pilot app updates its documents and charts over HTTP. We were able to modify the aeronautical charts retrieved by the app and presented to the pilot. Other communication (e.g., weather and flight plan filing) was carried out over HTTPS. The app does not accept self-signed certificates.

**Vulnerability:** An attacker with man-in-the-middle capability can tamper with EFB data used by the app.

**6.2.4 Receiver Integrity**

The GDL 39 firmware can be updated via Bluetooth using the Garmin Pilot app or a GDL 39 utility app. Because the receiver communicates with the iPad using the Bluetooth link, the iPad can remain connected to the Internet while communicating with the GDL 39. The firmware update relies on this: both the Garmin Pilot app and the GDL 39 Utility app check for new firmware when connected to the device and an Internet connection is available. All update-related communication is unencrypted and unauthenticated; we were able to redirect both apps to download our own firmware image.

**Vulnerability:** An attacker with brief proximity, collocated app, or update man-in-the-middle capability can install arbitrary receiver firmware.

#### 6.3 WingX Pro7 with the Sagetech Clarity

WingX Pro7 is an independent app that interoperates with eleven different UAT receivers. WingX Pro7 requires a $99.99 per year subscription. It provides FAA aeronautical charts and several real-time weather data products retrieved while the device has an Internet connection. We evaluated WingX Pro7 version 7.1.2.5 with the Sagetech Clarity UAT receiver.

The Sagetech Clarity CL01 UAT receiver costs $1,150 and includes a GPS receiver, 1090ES receiver, and UAT receiver. The CL02 model includes an AHRS module and costs $250 more. The Clarity unit communicates with the iPad via Wi-Fi in ad-hoc mode. The Clarity uses a message format very similar to the Garmin GDL 90 Data Interface Specification. In addition to this format, it includes messages with information about the current firmware, the serial number, and device status.

**6.3.1 Receiver to App Channel Integrity**

The Clarity receiver transmits all data unencrypted and unauthenticated. The WingX Pro7 app checks that the IP address subnet is correct but performs no other device authentication. As with the Stratus 2 and ForeFlight app, it is possible to impersonate the Clarity device to the WingX Pro7 app and to inject packets into the channel. We were successful in doing both.

**Vulnerability:** An attacker with time-of-use proximity or collocated app capability can manipulate all non-EFB data.

**6.3.2 App to Receiver Channel Integrity**

The Clarity is unique among the three devices we examined in that it does not receive any data from the app. A user cannot adjust any internal settings or trigger a firmware update using the app. Firmware updates require connecting the Clarity unit to a PC via USB.

**6.3.3 EFB Data Integrity**

All app data is retrieved unencrypted over HTTP, except for monetary transactions, which are done through the Apple App Store. We were able to modify the aeronautical charts and other information retrieved by the device.

**Vulnerability:** An attacker with man-in-the-middle capability can modify EFB data used by the app.

**6.3.4 Receiver Integrity**

To update the firmware on the Clarity, the unit must be connected to a Windows PC via USB. The firmware can then be updated using the Sagetech Clarity Firmware Update application. The firmware image is bundled with the application itself; updating the firmware requires downloading a new version of the Update application. The update itself relies on the standard USB Device Firmware Update (DFU) protocol. While the DFU protocol standardizes how data is transferred over USB, it does not specify a format for the update image, treating it as a sequence of bytes only. In the case of the Clarity, the firmware image is not encrypted or authenticated. We were able to update the Clarity firmware with a modified firmware image.

Modifying the device firmware requires either physical access to the unit or the ability to modify the Update application, either on the user’s PC or while it is being downloaded. The Firmware Update application is downloaded from Sagetech over HTTP; HTTPS is not supported.

**Vulnerability:** An attacker with brief access or update man-in-the-middle capability can install arbitrary receiver firmware.

#### 6.4 Malicious Firmware Attack

To demonstrate attacks on receiver integrity on the Sagetech Clarity and the Garmin GDL 39, we developed a modified firmware image for each. The modified firmware perturbs GPS coordinates within 20 miles of an "attractor," so that a pilot attempting to fly in a straight line through the area is led to deviate toward the center. We were able to install the malicious firmware on both the GDL 39 (via brief proximity) and the Clarity (via brief access or update man-in-the-middle tampering).

#### 6.5 Malicious Collocated App Attack

We also developed a malicious iOS app that carries out two attacks. In the first attack, the malicious app impersonates Stratus broadcasts to the ForeFlight app, causing it to display incorrect data. In the second attack, our app downgrades the Stratus 2 firmware. The first attack requires the app to run in the background while the ForeFlight app is running, while the second attack does not require the app to remain running after the downgrade.

We also developed an Android app attacking the GDL 39. Our app updates the GDL 39 firmware without user knowledge (see Section 6.4). This attack requires the app to be launched when the GDL 39 receiver is powered and paired with the Android device.

Gaining the collocated app capability necessary to carry out the above attack can be achieved by tricking the user into installing an app on her device. There are several ways of doing so: by developing a new app users might be lured into trying (and, for the first two attacks, keeping) or by cloning a popular app (e.g., Flappy Bird) [34]. An attacker can also buy an existing app and its user base from the app developer and then release an update with the attack functionality.

### 7. Recommendations

The attacks described in Section 6 can be prevented by following well-established secure design recommendations described in prior work on similar systems [6, 49].

**7.1 Receiver to App Channel**

Data sent from the receiver to the app should be signed by the device. Device private keys should be stored in non-volatile memory accessible only by the signed code. (Most modern SoCs provide secure non-volatile memory storage, as well as AES hardware.) Furthermore, each receiver should have its own private key, so that even if a private key is extracted from one device, it cannot be used in another.

**Pairing:** The receiver and app should be paired, and the app should only accept data from the receiver to which it has been paired. Pairing should always require explicit user interaction.

**Replay Protection:** The data authentication scheme should also protect against replay, for example, by using a nonce randomly generated by the app and a message sequence number. The receiver should also generate periodic, time-stamped heartbeat messages. The app should ensure that the message timestamps are within the expected period, allowing for a small amount of clock drift. This prevents an attacker from significantly delaying information from the receiver.

**Preventing Selective Denial:** In Section 4.1, we pointed out the possibility that an attacker could attempt to selectively block certain messages. With both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth protocol stacks, it is possible to arrange reliable, in-order message delivery to the application layer. Therefore, an application should not silently drop messages that fail to authenticate and should not ignore gaps in the message sequence numbers, as this indicates adversarial message tampering rather than natural transmission errors.

**7.2 App to Receiver Channel**

Any receiver configuration changes sent by the app to the receiver should be signed by the paired app (see Pairing above). The same session nonce and sequence number mechanism should be used as for the receiver-to-app channel. Pairing should require user input, for example, pressing the power button rapidly three times.

**7.3 Firmware Updates**

Firmware updates should be signed by the developer. The signature should be checked by a secure bootloader. Ideally, program flash should be large enough to hold two firmware images, so that, should an update fail, the bootloader could load the previously working image.

It is advisable for the bootloader to be able to handle revocation of the public developer key used to authenticate firmware images.

**7.4 EFB Updates**

EFB updates should be signed by the app data provider. Most aeronautical data has a pair of "effective from...to" dates. These should be used to prevent an attacker from downgrading aeronautical data.

Ideally, the entire FAA to MCIS supply chain should be secured. However, to our knowledge, the FAA does not digitally sign the aeronautical data it provides. At the very least, the aeronautical data provider should download the data from the FAA site using HTTPS to prevent man-in-the-middle tampering.

**7.5 Aeronautical Information Services**

The security issues of today's aeronautical information services have been discussed in prior work (see Section 2.1). We hope that these problems will be remedied in the future. When this happens, MCISes should be updated to authenticate the information received via these services.

**7.6 Security-Aware Software Development**

The vulnerabilities described in Section 6 resulted from a failure to consider security threats in the design of the MCIS. We did not look for traditional programming errors, such as buffer overflows, because we did not need to: design flaws alone were sufficient to successfully attack these systems. MCIS developers should ensure that their software development practices do not undermine the security of their systems.

### 8. Conclusion

We motivated this work with the question: Do mobile cockpit information systems provide the security guarantees expected of them? Our evaluation of three popular MCIS solutions—ForeFlight with the Appareo Stratus 2, Garmin Pilot with the Garmin GDL 39, and WingX Pro7 with the Sagetech Clarity—revealed significant vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities can be mitigated by implementing well-established secure design practices, including data signing, strong pairing mechanisms, and secure firmware updates. Ensuring the security of MCIS is crucial for the safety and reliability of aviation operations.
