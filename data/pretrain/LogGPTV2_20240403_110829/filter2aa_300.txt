#### Introduction

#### The Internet of Things (IoT)
- **Things...**
  - Not your fridge.
  - An Internet of things, not things on the Internet.

#### Sensor Networks
- **Definition and Functionality**
  - What are they?
  - What are they supposed to do?
  - Common applications and uses.

#### Network Technologies for Sensor Networks
- **ZigBee (802.15.4)**
  - Low-Power Wireless Network
  - **Advantages:**
    - Energy efficiency
    - Scalability
    - Reliability
  - **Limitations:**
    - Limited range
    - Data rate constraints

- **6LoWPAN (IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks)**
  - Runs on top of ZigBee MAC (802.15.4)
  - IPv6 for Low-Power Wireless
  - **Advantages:**
    - IPv6 support
    - End-to-end connectivity
  - **Limitations:**
    - Complexity in implementation
    - Resource constraints

#### Project Overview
- **Objective:**
  - Build a Darknet of Things
  - A fun and engaging project
  - Hardware hacking at an advanced level
  - Create the largest free-roaming sensor network in the world (DC21?!)

- **Community Involvement:**
  - A collaborative project for the community
  - No Arduino (overdone and not powerful enough)
  - Must be hackable, modifiable, and stable
  - Maintainable and fixable if issues arise
  - Must work outside DefCon, e.g., at home or hackerspaces

#### The Hardware
- **Darknet Badges (Planned for DefCon 21)**
  - 2 ARM Microprocessors (1 Main, 1 Network)
  - USB (2 ports, host and client)
  - 2.8” TFT Touch Screen
  - 6LoWPAN Network Connectivity
  - Battery-Powered and Rechargeable

- **Features:**
  - **HACKABLE:**
    - JTAG Headers and Peripherals Available
    - Open hardware schematics and software toolchain
  - **EXPANDABLE:**
    - SDRAM Pads Available
    - Unused peripherals available
  - **Development Boards and Access Points:**
    - Network-only development boards
    - UARTs exposed
    - 1 x MC13224v
    - USB + JTAG
  - **McMote:**
    - 1” circular size
    - UART for expansion (direct FT232R compatible)
    - RGB LED
    - CR2032 Powered
  - **MC13224v to Ethernet (McNic):**
    - Small form factor
    - AP-style operation
    - 6LoWPAN -> IPv6 Ethernet

#### Hardware Demonstration
- Let's hope the sacrifices have worked...

#### Potential
- For Fun and Profit!
- Now to the fun part: How you can get involved.

#### Why and How You Can Get Involved
- **Community Project:**
  - Break out of the Arduino rut
  - Expose people to new chips and coding possibilities
  - Something different and fun to work on

- **Projects - Darknet of Things:**
  - **Goal:**
    - Build fun things that operate as a DarkNet of things
  - **Hardware Information:**
    - [http://www.dcgdark.net] (IPv4/IPv6)
    - [http://dev.dcgdark.net] (IPv6 only)
  - **Working IPv6 connectivity is a requirement.**

- **Projects - ARM Dev Environment:**
  - **Goal:**
    - Create a better development library for ARM chips
    - Improve upon CMSIS
    - Develop something more akin to ATmega libraries
  - **More Information:**
    - [http://arm.dcgdark.net] (IPv4/IPv6)

- **Get Involved!**
  - Custom badge artwork for DCG’s
  - Get some hardware (more information later)
  - Get the BOM/Schematics, make your own!
  - LEARN, HACK, HAVE FUN, TEACH!
