The Darknet of Things
Building Sensor Networks to do our bidding.

The Internet of Things
Things...
No, Not your fridge.
An Internet of things, not things on the Internet.
Sensor Networks
What are they
What they (are supposed to) do
What they are used for (usually)
The Network part of Sensor Networks
ZigBee (802.15.4)
LowPower Wireless Network
Advantages
Limitations
6LowPan
802.15.4 (Yup, Runs on top of ZigBee MAC)
IPv6 for Low Power Wireless
Advantages
Limitations
So...
What are we doing here...
The Project
Build a Darknet... of Things
A darknet of things
Something fun to build
Hardware hacking taken to the next level
build the largest free-roaming sensor network in the 
world. (DC21?!)
A project for the community to work on
Considerations
NO ARDUINO
Overdone
People already know it (let’s learn something new)
Processors aren’t powerful enough. (to really do 
anything interesting)
Considerations
Must be HACKABLE
People need to have fun with it.
Modiﬁable, Changeable, Bendable.
But still stable.
Considerations
Maintainable
Fix shit if it b0rk3s.
Shit happens.
Considerations
Must be a network of THINGS (Not things on a 
network)
Wearable/Moveable.
Pocketable.
Considerations
Must work outside of DefCon
Needs to be able to work at home/hackerspaces
Access-Points/Development boards available
The Hardware
Darknet Badges...
Planned for DefCon 21
2 ARM Micro Processors (1 Main, 1 Network)
USB (2 ports, host and client)
2.8” TFT Touch Screen
6LowPan Network Connectivity
Battery Powered and Rechargable
DarkNet Badges...
HACKABLE
JTAG Headers and Peripherals Available
Hardware Schematics, Software ToolChain etc.
Open and Available, and part of a project we are 
starting today.. More information later.
DarkNet Badges...
EXPANDABLE
SDRAM Pads Available
unused peripherals available
Dev. Boards and AP’s
Network only development boards
Designed to be attached to your projects
UART(s) exposed
1 x MC13224v
USB + JTAG
Dev. Boards and AP’s
McMote
1” circular size.
UART for expansion (direct 
FT232R compat.)
RGB LED
CR2032 Powered
Dev Boards and AP’s
MC13224v to Ethernet (McNic)
Small form factor
AP style operation
6lowPan -> ipv6 ethernet
Hardware Demonstration
Lets hope the sacriﬁces have worked...
The Potential
For Fun and Proﬁt!
Now to the fun part...
Why and how you can get involved.
If you build it...
We felt the community needed a common project.
Break people OUT of the Arduino RUT!
Expose people to a new chip and coding possibilities
Something Different and Fun to work on.
Projects - Darknet of things.
Goal
Build fun things that operate *AS* a DarkNet of 
things.
We’ve got badges for next year... what are you going 
to do?
Projects - Darknet of things.
Hardware information at:
http://www.dcgdark.net - ipv4/ipv6
http://dev.dcgdark.net - ipv6 only
Working ipv6 connectivity is a requirement.
Projects - ARM Dev Environment.
Goal
Create a better development library for the ARM 
chips.
CMSIS is bullshit.
Something More akin to atmega libraries.
Projects - ARM Dev Environment.
More Information at: 
http://arm.dcgdark.net - ipv4/ipv6
Get Involved!
Custom badge artwork for DCG’s
Get some hardware (we will have more information 
later)
Get the BOM/Schematics, make your own!
LEARN, HACK, HAVE FUN, TEACH!
Thanks!
Big thanks go out to the following people to who 
helped us get started on this adventure...
Our Wives
Russr and DC719 for Inspiration and encouragment.
DC503 for being awesome!
Your Mom... ( :-P ) Well, we won’t go into that one.
