weight in the data disclosure context to high. Next an ap-
propriate control implementation (e.g. a patch) is related
to the vulnerability, i.e. as long as the control implementa-
tion is not in place the vulnerability exploitation probability
is high. After incorporating these knowledge facts into the
security ontology we generate a new Bayesian network by
the proposed approach. With the new network the new vul-
nerability is already taken into account at the probability
determination of the data disclosure threat.
6.2 Inventory Effort
As at every risk management approach the proposed ap-
proach requires the organization to inventory its entire in-
frastructure. In [12] we have shown how third party tools
such as Nmap or Windows Server Update Services can be
used to enhance the e(cid:14)ciency of the initial inventory pro-
cess. By mapping existing inventory databases and Nmap
scanning results to the security ontology we were able to
e(cid:14)ciently incorporate data such as host names and client
software con(cid:12)gurations into the security ontology. Besides
IT infrastructure data, the organization still has to manual-
ly model its physical infrastructure and security policies in
the security ontology if they want to be able to reason over
the entire organizational setting. Depending on the organi-
zation’s IT infrastructure it may be necessary to incorporate
speci(cid:12)c vulnerabilities and control implementations into the
ontology. While the ontology provides an initial set of in-
formation security knowledge out of the box the complexity
of adding new knowledge has been described in the previous
paragraph.
6.3 Show Case
Subsequent to the qualitative expert evaluation of the pro-
posed Bayesian threat probability determination, this sec-
tion describes a show case using the corresponding AURUM
(AUtomated Risk and Utility Management) tool. AURUM
has been developed as an automated information security
risk management support tool utilizing the security ontolo-
gy and the Bayesian threat probability determination. Note
that this tool description only refers to the probability de-
termination.
Figure 6: AURUM user interface - risk determina-
tion
Figure 6 depicts the AURUM interface which supports the
risk manager at the risk determination phase. The exem-
plary threat probability determination is conducted for the
ent:SBACustomerData element, representing the customer
data of SBA. As described in Section 5 the Bayesian threat
probability network is automatically generated based on the
security ontology ([13] describes the methodology which has
352
been used to map the ontological structure to a Bayesian
network). Tree views have been used to visualize this com-
plex network in a comprehensible form (see Figure 6). Since
ent:SBACustomerData represents a data instance it faces
three di(cid:11)erent risks ! data disclosure, data loss, and data
tampering. Each risk is the product of the asset’s impact
rating and the probability of the corresponding threat. As
described in Section 4, the probability of a threat is de-
termined by the probabilities of its predecessor threats, the
exploitation probability of corresponding vulnerabilities, the
e(cid:11)ectiveness of existing control implementations, the a pri-
ori threat probability, and the attacker’s e(cid:11)ectiveness. Since
the input values for existing control implementations, a pri-
ori probabilities, and the attacker’s e(cid:11)ectiveness depend on
the considered asset this section examines how AURUM de-
termines the threat probability for ent:SBACustomerData
in the context of the data loss threat, i.e. if the threat real-
izes data would not be longer available to the organization.
Prior to conducting the following calculations it is required
to map relevant infrastructure of the organization to the se-
curity ontology (see [10] for details about the applied system
characterization method). All values in AURUM are repre-
sented by ranges which depend on the rating scale which
has been used at the nodes (e.g. 33% ranges for a three-
point Likert scale). Although, the range span leaves room
for interpretation the user can use the ranges to evaluate
threat probabilities by comparing their upper bound values.
The range visualization at the (cid:12)nal results should empha-
size the uncertainty with which we have to deal in the risk
management domain.
The resource risk tree in Figure 6 shows three di(cid:11)erent
types of vulnerabilities: (1) technical - no virus scanner, (2)
physical - no access regulation control, and (3) organization-
al - no backup strategy.
To determine the exploitation probability of the no virus
scanner vulnerability, it is crucial to check if an instance of
the transaction security and virus protection software con-
cept is installed on the (cid:12)le server on which the SBA customer
data is located. It is assumed that the virus scanner Ikarus
Defender is installed on the (cid:12)le server. Thus, the virus s-
canner protects the (cid:12)le server and the SBA customer data
from malware a(cid:15)iction and closes the no virus scanner vul-
nerability (vulnerability exploitation probability = 0 - 33%).
The green bar of the transaction security and virus protec-
tion node indicates that the virus scanner Ikarus Defender
is highly e(cid:11)ective at mitigating the corresponding vulnera-
bility.
The no access regulation control vulnerability exploitation
probability is determined by the e(cid:11)ectiveness of an access
system, an entry checkpoint or security guard, and the at-
tacker’s e(cid:11)ectiveness. Because the no access regulation con-
trol vulnerability is on the section level (sec:vulnerabilityOn)
is has to be checked if the required controls are implemented
in the physical location of the (cid:12)le server. It is assumed that
the highly e(cid:11)ective EntryCheckpoint A and the medium ef-
fective AccessSystem A are located in server room. Since
the attacker is rated with a 17 - 50% e(cid:11)ectiveness and the
control combinations are rated with a 33 - 67% and 67 -
100% e(cid:11)ectiveness, the no access regulation vulnerability is
mitigated to a 0 - 33% exploitation probability.
The no backup strategy vulnerability represents an or-
ganizational vulnerability and therefore the existence of an
appropriate policy determines the exploitation probability.
Since policies are implemented at the organization level, it
is necessary to check if a data backup policy is implemented
for the organization which owns the (cid:12)le server. SBA im-
plemented a low e(cid:11)ective data backup policy which covers
amongst others the (cid:12)le server’s data. Due to the high a pri-
ori probability of the data loss threat, the low e(cid:11)ective SBA
data backup policy mitigates the exploitation probability of
the no backup strategy vulnerability to 44 - 78%.
Due to the hierarchy of the Bayesian threat probability
network, control implementations on di(cid:11)erent levels a(cid:11)ect
the (cid:12)nal threat probability with di(cid:11)erent intensities. There-
fore, AURUM supports the user with weights for each con-
trol implementation in a speci(cid:12)c threat context. In the case
of the data loss threat the following weights have been de-
termined by AURUM: data backup policy (0.1666), locked
doors policy (0.0763), access system (0.0509), entry check-
point or security guard (0.0509), transaction security and
virus protection software (0.0416), anti theft device (0.0277),
lightning arrester (0.0138), safety door (0.0046), and (cid:12)re ex-
tinguisher (0.0046). With this results on hand the user will
rather implement a sound data backup policy instead of in-
vesting a lot of money in expensive safety doors to avoid data
loss. It has to be stressed that this is only relevant for the
considered data loss threat, where the only goal is to ensure
data availability to the organization. The controls and their
weights would be di(cid:11)erent in the context of the data disclo-
sure threat (a(cid:11)ecting the con(cid:12)dentiality). Therefore, highly
e(cid:11)ective data backup policies which are requiring the orga-
nization to backup their data to a remote location are the
most e(cid:14)cient solution to avoid data loss. Section 5 provides
a detailed description of the algorithm used to calculate the
weights.
To illustrate the weights’ role in the calculation schema
the following scenario is assumed: amongst other control im-
plementations the SBA customer data is protected by a low
e(cid:11)ective safety door and a low e(cid:11)ective data backup policy
which results in a data loss probability of 31 - 64%. To lower
the data loss probability for the valuable customer data the
risk manager is forced to implement more e(cid:11)ective control
implementations. The aforementioned weights of relevan-
t control implementations revealed that the risk manager
should prefer the implementation of a sound data backup
policy instead of investing in a safety door. The Bayesian
threat probability determination con(cid:12)rms these recommen-
dations. If a high e(cid:11)ective safety door and a low e(cid:11)ective
data backup policy is entered into the Bayesian network the
data loss threat probability decreases by 1% to 30 - 63%. If
a low e(cid:11)ective safety door but a high e(cid:11)ective data backup
policy is in place the probability of a data loss decreases by
15% to 16 - 49%. The following combination con(cid:12)rms the
minor in(cid:13)uence of the safety door on the data loss probabil-
ity: setting besides the data backup policy also the safety
door to a high e(cid:11)ectiveness, results also in a threat probabil-
ity of 16 - 49% (in fact the safety door implementation has
a marginal in(cid:13)uence but due to rounding errors the threat
probability remains unchanged).
7. CONCLUSION
The question is if the proposed ontology-based Bayesian
threat probability determination is the solution to the fun-
damental information security risk management problem,
namely disposing of realistic probability values. The an-
swer is neither yes nor no. The advantage of the proposed
353
Bayesian threat probability determination is that it gives
the risk manager a methodology to determine the threat
probability in a structured and comprehensible way. The
calculation schema is fully documented and each state of
the Bayesian network can be explained and justi(cid:12)ed math-
ematically and formally taking the given input factors in-
to consideration.
In addition to the Bayesian calculation
schema, the security ontology is used to enrich the Bayesian
network with concrete information security domain knowl-
edge. However, the high dependence on realistic input val-
ues (attacker pro(cid:12)le, control implementation e(cid:11)ectiveness,
and a priori threat probabilities) requires further research
on sound methods and techniques to gather, store, and pro-
vide these crucial threat probability calculation components.
Therefore, we aim at establishing a public knowledge shar-
ing portal based on the security ontology structure in order
to collaboratively extend the security ontology knowledge
base with a priori probabilities and knowledge necessary for
a sound node weight determination. Although this is a very
ambitious goal, we hope to establish a reliable and widely
accepted information security knowledge base.
