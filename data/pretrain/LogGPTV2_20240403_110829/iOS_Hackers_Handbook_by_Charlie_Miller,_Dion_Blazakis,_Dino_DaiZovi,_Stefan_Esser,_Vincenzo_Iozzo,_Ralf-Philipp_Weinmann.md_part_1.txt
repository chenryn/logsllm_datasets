About the Authors
Charlie Miller is a Principal Research Consultant at Accuvant Labs. Dr. Miller
was a Global Network Exploitation Analyst at the National Security Agency
(NSA) for 5 years. He was the fi rst person to fi nd a public remote exploit for both
the iPhone and the G1 Android phone. He has won the CanSecWest Pwn2Own
hacking competition for the last four years in row. He has exploited an iPhone
via text messages and found code-signing fl aws which could introduce malware
in iOS. Reporting the latter got him kicked out of the iOS developer program.
He has authored two information security books and holds a PhD from the
University of Notre Dame.
Dionysus Blazakis is a programmer and security researcher specializing in
exploit mitigation techniques. He has spoken at multiple security conferences
on exploitation mitigations, mitigation bypasses, and new methods for vulner-
ability discovery. Working with Charlie Miller, he developed an iOS exploit for
Pwn2own 2011 to win the iPhone exploitation prize. Dionysus also won the
2010 Pwnie Award for Most Innovative Research, recognizing his presentation
of techniques leveraging a JIT compiler to bypass data execution prevention.
Dino Dai Zovi, Co-Founder and CTO at Trail of Bits, has been working in
information security for over a decade with experience in red teaming, penetra-
tion testing, software security, information security management, and cyberse-
curity R&D. Dino is also a regular speaker at information security conferences
having presented his independent research on memory corruption exploitation
techniques, 802.11 wireless client attacks, and Intel VT-x virtualization rootkits at
conferences around the world including DEFCON, BlackHat, and CanSecWest.
He is a co-author of the books The Mac Hacker’s Handbook (Wiley, 2009) and

iv About the Authors
The Art of Software Security Testing (Addison-Wesley, 2006). He is perhaps best
known in the information security and Mac communities for winning the fi rst
PWN2OWN contest at CanSecWest 2007.
Vincenzo Iozzo is a security researcher at Tiqad srl. He is a regular speaker at
various information security conferences including Black Hat and CanSecWest.
He is perhaps best known in the information security industry for co-writing the
exploits for BlackBerryOS and iPhoneOS to win Pwn2own 2010 and Pwn2own
2011. He also serves on the review board for Black Hat and Shakacon. He tweets
at @_snagg.
Stefan Esser is best known in the security community as the PHP security
guy. Since he became a PHP core developer in 2002 he devoted a lot of time to
PHP and PHP application vulnerability research. However in his early days he
released lots of advisories about vulnerabilities in software like CVS, Samba,
OpenBSD, or Internet Explorer. In 2003 he was the fi rst to boot Linux directly
from the harddisk of an unmodifi ed XBOX through a buffer overfl ow in the
XBOX font loader. In 2004 he founded the Hardened-PHP Project to develop a
more secure version of PHP, known as Hardened-PHP, which evolved into the
Suhosin PHP Security System in 2006. Since 2007 he works as head of research
and development for the German web application company SektionEins GmbH
that he co-founded. Since 2010, he is actively researching iOS security topics;
and in 2011, he supplied the jailbreaking scene with an exploit that survived
multiple updates by Apple.
Ralf-Philipp Weinmann is a postdoctoral researcher at the University of
Luxembourg. His research interests in information security are diverse, span-
ning topics from cryptanalysis to the security of mobile devices. He has been
known to be involved in drastic speed-ups of WEP cracking; an analysis of
Apple’s FileVault; reverse-engineering; breaking proprietary cryptographic
algorithms in DECT; and penetrating smartphones, both through web browsers
(PWN2OWN), as well as through their GSM stacks. Ralf has studied computer
science and completed a Ph.D. in cryptography at the TU Darmstadt in Germany.

About the Technical Editor
Eric McDonald (“MuscleNerd”) is a Staff Engineer at a southern Calfornia
high-tech fi rm where he specializes in reverse engineering BIOSes. He is a mem-
ber of the iPhone Dev Team, which has been developing free iPhone jailbreaks
and carrier unlocks since the fi rst iPhone in 2007. He was previously involved
in hacking the fi rst two generations of TiVo hardware and was technical editor
of Hacking the TiVo, 2nd Edition Course Technology PTR, 2004. Originally from the
Boston area, he holds S.B and S.M. degrees from M.I.T.

Acknowledgments
I’d like to thank my wife, Andrea, for her continuous love and support, as well
as my two boys, Theo and Levi, members of the next generation of iOS hackers
and jailbreakers.
— Charlie
First, I’d like to thank Alayna, Simon, and Oliver for their patience and love
over the months I spent working at night after getting home. I’d also like to
acknowledge the huge amount of work the jailbreak community has produced. In
addition to the professional jailbreaks they produce, they’ve also made a security
researcher's job much easier through documentation, such as the iPhone wiki,
and tools for the extraction and modifi cation of iOS fi rmware.
— Dion
I’d like to thank my parents, sister, and close valuable friends for their continual
support, especially during the time that I was working on this book. Without
them, I’d have gone crazy long ago. I’d also like to thank the iOS jailbreak devel-
oper community for performing great technical research and releasing their
tools freely, often with full source code. Finally, I’d like to acknowledge Pablo
and Paco for their help on my previous book.
— Dino

viii Acknowledgments
I’d like to thank my parents, my brother, and all my close friends, who sup-
ported me and my sometimes crazy ideas throughout my whole life. Especially
I want to thank Nami, who is my soulmate for many years now.
— Stefan
I’d like to thank everyone, both in my personal and professional world, who
helped me down this bumpy road; you are defi nitely too many to be named
here. A special thanks to Naike and Max, who put up with me while writing
the chapters of this book.
— Vincenzo
I'd like to thank the women in my life; for they had to suffer the hardship of my
abandoning them for the machines while writing. I would like to thank Thomas
Dullien, Joshua Lackey and Harald Welte for many enlightening discussions
and comments during my months of baseband research in 2010. A big thank
you to Jacob Appelbaum for bringing me into contact with the engineer who
triggered the subject to be researched. There are people to be thanked who
prefer to be nameless: you know who you are; thanks for everything! Last but
not least I would like to praise the work of the iPhone dev team. Many things
would've been much harder without their work. Especially MuscleNerd and
planetbeing were very helpful when I got stuck with the iPhone4 and roxfan
deserves mad props for providing me with his scatter-loading script.
