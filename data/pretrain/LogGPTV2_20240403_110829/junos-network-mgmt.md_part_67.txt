A redundant Ethernet interface contains physical interfaces from both the primary and secondary nodes
in the SRX Series chassis cluster. In a redundant Ethernet interface, two physical interfaces are
configured with each node contributing one physical interface. In a redundant Ethernet interface LAG,
more than two physical interfaces are configured in the redundant Ethernet interface.

This example shows how to monitor SRX Series Firewalls with chassis cluster enabled.
Requirements
• You need two SRX5800 Services Gateways with identical hardware configurations, one SRX Series
Firewall and one EX8208 Ethernet Switch.
• Physically connect the two SRX5800 devices (back-to-back for the fabric and control ports) and
ensure that they are the same models. Configure/add these two devices in a cluster.
Overview
IN THIS SECTION
Topology | 819
IP address monitoring checks end-to-end reachability of configured IP address and allows a redundancy
group to automatically fail over when not reachable through the child link of redundant Ethernet
interface (known as a reth) interface. Redundancy groups on both devices in a cluster can be configured
to monitor specific IP addresses to determine whether an upstream device in the network is reachable.
819
When you configure multiple IP addresses on the reth Interface in a chassis cluster setup, IP monitoring
uses the first IP address from the list of IP addresses configured for that reth interface on the primary
node, and the first IP address from the list of secondary IP addresses configured for that reth interface
on the backup node. The first IP address is the one with smallest prefix (netmask).
This example shows how to set up IP monitoring on an SRX Series Firewall.
NOTE: IP monitoring is not supported on an NP-IOC card.
NOTE: IP monitoring does not support MIC online/offline status on SRX Series Firewalls.
Topology
Figure 30 on page 819 shows the topology used in this example.

In this example, two SRX5800 devices in a chassis cluster are connected to an SRX1500 device through

cluster.

Step-by-Step Procedure
The following example requires you to navigate various levels in the configuration hierarchy. For
instructions on how to do that, see Using the CLI Editor in Configuration Mode in the Junos OS CLI User
Guide .
To configure IP monitoring on an SRX Series Firewall:
1. Specify the number of redundant Ethernet interfaces.
{primary:node0}[edit]
user@host# set chassis cluster reth-count 1
2. Specify a redundancy group's priority for primacy on each node of the cluster. The higher number
takes precedence.
{primary:node0}[edit]

user@host# set chassis cluster redundancy-group 0 node 1 priority 1
user@host# set chassis cluster redundancy-group 1 node 0 priority 200

3. Configure the redundant Ethernet interfaces to redundancy-group 1.
{primary:node0}[edit]
user@host# set interfaces reth0 redundant-ether-options redundancy-group 1
user@host# set interfaces reth0 unit 0 family inet address 192.0.2.1/24

• The redundant Ethernet (reth0) IP address, 192.0.2.1/24, is used to send ICMP packets
from node 0 to check the reachability of the monitored IP.
823
• The secondary IP address, 192.0.2.2, should belong to the same network as the reth0 IP
address.

This example shows how to configure redundancy group IP address monitoring for an SRX Series
Firewall in a chassis cluster.
Requirements
Before you begin:
• Set the chassis cluster node ID and cluster ID. See Example: Setting the Node ID and Cluster ID for
Security Devices in a Chassis Cluster
• Configure the chassis cluster management interface. See Example: Configuring the Chassis Cluster
Management Interface.
• Configure the chassis cluster fabric. See Example: Configuring the Chassis Cluster Fabric Interfaces.
Overview
You can configure redundancy groups to monitor upstream resources by pinging specific IP addresses
that are reachable through redundant Ethernet interfaces on either node in a cluster. You can also
configure global threshold, weight, retry interval, and retry count parameters for a redundancy group.
When a monitored IP address becomes unreachable, the weight of that monitored IP address is
deducted from the redundancy group IP address monitoring global threshold. When the global threshold
reaches 0, the global weight is deducted from the redundancy group threshold. The retry interval
determines the ping interval for each IP address monitored by the redundancy group. The pings are sent
827
as soon as the configuration is committed. The retry count sets the number of allowed consecutive ping
failures for each IP address monitored by the redundancy group.
In this example, you configure the following settings for redundancy group 1:
• IP address to monitor—10.1.1.10
• IP address monitoring global-weight—100
• IP address monitoring global-threshold—200
The threshold applies cumulatively to all IP addresses monitored by the redundancy group.
• IP address retry-interval—3 seconds
• IP address retry-count—10
• Weight—100
• Redundant Ethernet interface—reth1.0
• Secondary IP address—10.1.1.101
