- The HTTP status code 307 indicates that the client should "try the same verb on a new URL."
- The `Client` in this context allows callers to define a redirect policy (`CheckRedirect`) to determine whether a given HTTP redirect should be followed.
- However, `Client.Do()` passes an additional policy to `doFollowingRedirects()` for GET, HEAD, PUT, and POST requests. This additional policy is evaluated before `CheckRedirect`.
- For PUT and POST requests, the additional policy only follows redirects with status codes 302 and 303.
- Additionally, `doFollowingRedirects()` explicitly changes the HTTP method from POST or PUT to GET when a redirect occurs.
- As a result, the API does not provide a way for callers to follow a 307 redirect while maintaining the original HTTP method.

The rationale behind this behavior is likely based on the specification, which states that "the user agent MUST NOT automatically redirect the request unless it can be confirmed by the user." 

To improve the API, it should allow the `CheckRedirect` policy to indicate that following such redirects (e.g., 307) is acceptable. Notably, tools like `wget` and `curl` support these types of redirects.
