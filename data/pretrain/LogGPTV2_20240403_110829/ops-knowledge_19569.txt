User: About the configuration and authorization of RBAC in Kubernetes cluster
Assistant: The Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system of a Kubernetes cluster allows administrators to assign specific permissions to users and applications in the cluster to access the Kubernetes API. RBAC configuration is based on roles and the way roles are bound. Before configuring Kubernetes RBAC, you must confirm that both the kubectl command-line tool and the API Server have enabled RBAC configuration. RBAC of Kubernetes plays an important role in separation of duties and responsibilities, authority control, and authorization audit. Basic RBAC objects include the following three types: - Role: Permission definition at the Namespace level, a Role definition can only be used on the same Namespace, it cannot be mixed with ClusterRole - ClusterRole: Cluster-level permission definition, it defines Definition of permissions at the cross-Namespace level - RoleBinding and ClusterRoleBinding: Bind Role or ClusterRole to specific identities, and are used to define the permissions of identities in a specific Namespace or the entire cluster respectively. Cooperating with RBAC's Context management, it can conveniently and quickly manage the authority control in multi-Namespace clusters. For Kubernetes' RBAC authorization management, the general steps are as follows: 1. Create a namespace $ kubectl create namespace test-namespace 2. Create a Role Kubernetes allows Role authorization The operation capability of certain resources in a specific Namespace, the Role must contain the necessary rules sub-attributes. $ kubectl create -f role-definition.yaml Example role-definition.yaml: apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 kind: Role metadata: namespace: test-namespace name: pod-reader rules: - apiGroups: [" "] resources: ["pods"] verbs: ["get", "watch", "list"] 3. Create a RoleBinding to bind a specific Role to a specific user or user group, so that this user or user group Have the corresponding operation authority, even in the same Namespace, the user authority may be different. $ kubectl create -f rolebinding-definition.yaml Example rolebinding-definition.yaml: apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 kind: RoleBinding metadata: name: read-pods-rolebinding namespace: test-namespace subjects: - kind: User name: janesmith apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io roleRef: kind: Role name: pod-reader apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io 4. Create a ClusterRole If you need to authorize a group of users outside of a Namespace, You need to use ClusterRole, which has the ability to control the permissions of the entire cluster. $ kubectl create -f clusterrole-definition.yaml Example clusterrole-definition.yaml: apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 kind: ClusterRole metadata: name: secret-reader rules: - apiGroups: [""] resources: [ "secrets"] verbs: ["get"] 5. Create a ClusterRoleBinding to bind the ClusterRole to a user or organization so that they have the authority to operate within the cluster. $ kubectl create -f clusterrolebinding-definition.yaml Example clusterrolebinding-definition.yaml: apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 kind: ClusterRoleBinding metadata: name: secret-reader-binding subjects: - kind: Group name: finance- group apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io roleRef: kind: ClusterRole name: secret-reader apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io The above demonstrates how to authenticate and authorize users requesting the Kubernetes API through RBAC authorization. In addition, when accessing resources across namespaces, the authorization mechanism between ServiceAccount and namespace can be used. For specific operations, please refer to the official Kubernetes documentation.
