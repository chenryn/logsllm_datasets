## Abstract
Electronic auction protocols must be verifiable to ensure trust among all stakeholders. This paper identifies and formalizes the notions of verifiability for each stakeholder—seller, buyer, and losing bidders. We then use this framework to analyze two specific e-auction protocols, identifying several issues.

## Introduction
Auctions provide a mechanism for sellers and buyers to exchange goods at a mutually acceptable price. Unlike marketplaces where sellers compete, auctions are a seller's market where buyers bid against each other. There are various types of auctions, such as English, Vickrey, Dutch, and sealed-bid auctions. In this paper, we focus on the verifiability of sealed-bid auctions, although our results are applicable to other types as well.

### Stakeholders in Auctions
- **Bidders:** Prospective buyers who aim to pay as little as possible.
- **Seller:** Aiming to sell for the highest possible price.
- **Auctioneer:** The party organizing the auction, with potential conflicts of interest.

The interests of these stakeholders are often opposed, leading to the need for a system that ensures the correctness of the auction process. An auction system must provide verifiability for all parties involved, ensuring that the selling price and winner are determined correctly.

### Challenges in Achieving Verifiability
While verifiability is straightforward in traditional "shout-out" auctions, maintaining it while ensuring other properties like non-repudiation and privacy is more complex. Many proposed auction protocols claim verifiability without providing formal proofs. To address this, we propose a generic formal framework for verifying auction protocols, independent of the type of auction.

### Contribution
Our main contribution is the identification of scheme-independent definitions that cover the verifiability of auctions. We focus on the perspectives of bidders (distinguishing between winning and losing bidders) and the seller. We present this framework as a set of formal verifiability tests and apply it to two existing auction protocols by Curtis et al. and Brandt, identifying issues in both.

### Related Work
Formal analyses of auction protocols are relatively rare. Some studies have focused on privacy and other properties but not verifiability. In the field of voting, several generic definitions of verifiability have emerged, which we draw inspiration from. However, the competitive nature of auctions introduces unique challenges, making direct translation from voting systems difficult.

## Modeling Auction Protocols
We consider a set of bidders \( B \) and a seller \( S \). Bids are of type `Bid`, and when submitted, they may be encrypted or anonymized to ensure privacy, resulting in `EBid`. We assume a public list \( L \) of all submitted bids, and a function `getPrice` that maps `EBid` to `Bid`. Additionally, a function `isReg` ensures that only registered bidders can submit valid bids. A function `win` computes the index of the winning bid, and `winBid` refers to the index of the announced winning bid.

### Definition
An auction protocol is defined as a tuple \((B, S, L, getPrice, isReg, win, winBid)\), where:
- \( B \) is the set of bidders.
- \( S \) is the seller.
- \( L \) is a list of all submitted bids.
- `getPrice` maps submitted bids to their actual values.
- `isReg` verifies if a bid was submitted by a registered bidder.
- `win` returns the index of the winning bid.
- `winBid` is the index of the winning bid at the end of the auction.

## Defining Verifiability
In this section, we formally define verifiability for auction protocols, starting with first-price auctions and then generalizing to other types.

### First-Price Auctions
To understand the necessary verifications, we consider the perspectives of different stakeholders:

- **Losing Bidder:** Wants to be convinced that:
  - The winning bid was superior to their bid (as defined by the `win` function).
  - The winning bid was submitted by another bidder, preventing manipulation by the seller or auctioneer.
- **Winning Bidder:** Needs to check that:
  - They are indeed the winner.
  - The winning bid was correctly recorded and not altered.

By formalizing these requirements, we can ensure that all stakeholders can verify the correctness of the auction process.

## Conclusion
This paper provides a comprehensive framework for defining and verifying the verifiability of e-auction protocols. By applying this framework to existing protocols, we have identified several issues, highlighting the importance of formal verification in ensuring the integrity and trustworthiness of electronic auctions.
