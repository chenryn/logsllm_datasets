### Optimal Routing with Multiple Objectives

#### Computational Results
The algorithm generated 30 solutions in 0.262 seconds. These solutions include 17 extreme non-dominated solutions and 13 non-extreme non-dominated solutions, resulting in a solution identification rate of 76.9%. The non-dominated solution points and the relationship between the number of solutions and the consumed computing time are illustrated in Figures 5 and 6, respectively.

#### Representative Nondominated Paths
Figure 8 depicts representative non-dominated paths. Each path represents a different trade-off between the objectives of minimizing route length and risk exposure (accident rate and population size).

- **Path 1**: This path minimizes risk exposure, leading to a zigzag-like itinerary.
- **Path 2**: This path prioritizes the shortest route, passing through several densely populated metropolitan areas.
- **Path 4**: This path represents a balanced compromise between route length and risk exposure.

#### Nondominated Solution Sets
Table 2 summarizes the non-dominated objective vectors for the decomposed subproblems and their synthetic results. The table includes the following:

- **Nondominated Objective Vectors w.r.t. Route Length and Accident Rate**
- **Nondominated Objective Vectors w.r.t. Accident Rate and Population Size**
- **Nondominated Objective Vectors w.r.t. Route Length, Accident Rate, and Population Size**

Some solutions may show a strong preference for one objective, while others may represent a good compromise between the objectives. For illustrative purposes, we have depicted the corresponding paths of these six representative solutions in the network (see Figure 8).

#### Network Visualization
The network visualization in Figure 8 shows the paths of the representative non-dominated solutions. The paths are labeled from Path 1 to Path 12, each highlighting different trade-offs between the objectives.

- **Path 1**: Minimizes risk exposure, resulting in a zigzag-like path.
- **Path 2**: Shortest path, passing through densely populated areas.
- **Path 4**: Balanced compromise between route length and risk exposure.

This visualization helps in understanding the trade-offs and making informed decisions based on the specific requirements and preferences.

By providing a clear and detailed analysis of the non-dominated solutions and their corresponding paths, this study aims to assist in making optimal routing decisions that balance multiple objectives.
