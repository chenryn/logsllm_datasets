I am using WebRTC in Electron (version 3.0.0-beta.6) for video meetings. I can see the peer's video when using Chrome, but Chrome cannot see my video. 

- When I configure it to use V8, everything works correctly.
- However, when I configure it to use H.264, I encounter an error.

When I switch to Electron version 2.0.7, Chrome can see my video, but I cannot see the other participant's video. Additionally, the user interface elements overlap.

The console logs the following error:
```
[99769:0822/173441.318182:ERROR:webrtcvideoengine.cc(676)] No video codecs supported.
```
