User: I've tried pip and easy_install, but I keep getting the following error:
error: command '/usr/bin/llvm-gcc' failed with exit status 1
I'm running OSX Lion and the install runs inside a virtualenv, with Python 2.7.2.
Thanks in advance.
Assistant: First a question: is libmemcached installed? If not, install it and retry. It probably is but just in case....
If pylibmc still doesn't install the problem is probably that libmemcached is not installed in a directory where gcc can discover it (this was a macports symptom in my case), in which case you can store the location in the environment when running pip from the command line:
LIBMEMCACHED=/opt/local pip install pylibmc
