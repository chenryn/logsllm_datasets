  1. There are ofter errors relating to the addition of nodes to the store. Could this failure be more silent, and not completely hide the display?
  2. When opening the react dev tools in a separate window, it does not respond to clicks or hover in the tree section. I can still click a component in the "rendered by" section. Note that this does not happen when the dev tools are opened in the same window. Update: it also didn't happen when I tried to put the two windows side by side in the same screen for a recording...
Please see the attached screen capture for both issues.
