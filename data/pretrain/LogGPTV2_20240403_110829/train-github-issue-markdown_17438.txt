### Which version of Sharding-Sphere do you using?
3.0.0M3
### Which project do you using? Sharding-JDBC or Sharding-Proxy?
Sharding-JDBC
### Expected behavior
there are two data sources ds-2017 and ds-2018 use year sharding database  
very data sources use month sharding tabale table1..12  
using create_date field in table sharding rule  
query 2017-08-01 to 2018-09-01 data
Sharding-Sphere-SQL.log  
select * from ds-2017.table1..12 where create_date between ? and ?  
select * from ds-2018.table1..12 where create_date between ? and ?  
way not  
select * from ds-2017.table8..12 where create_date between ? and ?  
select * from ds-2018.table1..09 where create_date between ? and ?
It's my sharding rule problem?
if database sharding rule and table sharding rule can unified processing, use
the same doBetweenSharding() method then can return the specified database
corresponds to the specified table  
like ds-2017 contain table8..table12 ds-2018 contain table1..09  
Map result = [{ds2017, [table8,table9....,table12]}, {ds2018,
[table1.....,table9]}]
please help answer this question thank you!
