Thanks to Contributors:
- core modern open source algorithms for strong 
cryptography have been heavy scrutinized, 
tested and are readily available  
- weak (DES, WEP, etc) and “black box” privacy 
tools are becoming a thing of the past 
- free and open source software has made it 
easier to trust the privacy of computer 
systems
Layer:01      Software
Let’s assume the software 
(hypothetically) is 100% secure…
Where do we go from here?
- firmware is almost exclusively closed source 
and controls almost all hardware devices and 
functions 
- due to their low-level nature, malicious 
firmware persists across OS reinstallations 
- "SPI flash is a really nice place if you can 
get there" (DEF CON 22: Summary of Attacks 
Against BIOS and Secure Boot)
Layer:02      Firmware
- hardware is almost always absolutely trusted 
by the rest of the system, as it is not widely 
considered an attack surface (especially in 
the consumer space)
Layer:03      Hardware
- hardware is almost always absolutely trusted 
by the rest of the system, as it is not widely 
considered an attack surface (especially in 
the consumer space) 
- NSA has been caught hardware backdooring Cisco 
systems (Glenn Greenwald, No Place to Hide), 
and DoD, Apple suspect adversarial nation 
states may be doing this as well

and DoD, Apple suspect adversarial nation 
states may be doing this as well 
- “if the hardware is compromised, then the 
whole machine is compromised” 
Layer:03      Hardware
hardware backdooring is real
- Management Engine runs on a 
dedicated logic device within the 
processor and runs proprietary 
firmware and OS 
- Intel ME has full network device 
access with the ability to 
intercept network traffic without 
the CPU’s knowledge 
- system access at the lowest level 
- remains functional in the 
background even if the system is 
shut down but remains on standby 
power
Layer:04     Intel Management Engine
Management Engine might sound like a feature reserved 
for enterprise or server applications, but it can be 
found everywhere

“In short, it’s a reverse-engineer’s worst 
nightmare.”

- effectively the perfect hardware backdoor, 
although ME is marketed as an IT out-of-band 
management tool 
- present in all Intel systems since ~2008-2009, 
with no practical way to disable or audit 
- handful of exploits exist for ME, with the 
number on the rise, requiring a firmware 
update from the manufacturer 
Note: AMD also has a similar black-box 
platform, called TrustZone / PSP, but it has 
not been well documented / researched (they 
haven’t made new CPUs until recently)
If we’re discussing a worst case situation for 
hardware security, just how far can we go?
Bonus Round: Speculation
- Hardware backdooring has been documented as 
mentioned earlier is viewed as a viable threat by 
other state actors (DoD) 
- nation states could backdoor product manufacturing 
with switched or additional components  
- scarier yet, chips themselves (CPUs, chipsets, 
NICs, ROMs) could be backdoored at the fabrication 
center 
What About Nation States?
If they’re willing to go this far…
What’s to stop them from going further?
- University of Michigan researchers documented 
how easy it would be to hide malicious 
features in processor designs at design time 
and fabrication time, even by a single rouge 
employee! (A2: Analog Malicious Hardware) 
- entirely possible for nation states to 
accomplish, and would lead to widespread and 
total compromise while being virtually 
undetectable

Why can’t we do for hardware 
what we did for software?
- open source OS is a good start, open source 
firmware (Libreboot, etc) is better along with 
open source hardware, “no blob” system is 
ideal

full functionality

What can be done for peace-of-mind 
private computation for critical 
situations and down-right paranoid 
users?
- Can we build a cost-effective low-
level solution that offers maximum 
transparency?
- Can we build a cost-effective low-
level solution that offers maximum 
transparency? 
- on our platform, Linux and all 
programs run on the FPGA, so we know 
exactly what the CPU is doing
- field programmable gate arrays 
are large blocks of 
configurable digital logic 
gates  
- chips are designed in special 
languages called HDLs (hardware 
description languages)  
- bitstream generators read these 
files and program the gates 
within the FPGA to function as 
the HDL code dictates 
- most commonly used for chip 
design and testing, special 
hardware applications

cryptographic use case  
- Runs GNU/Linux 
- Fully open-source

The Results  
(it’s complicated)
The Final Product:
Works(ed) great!
until this
and this…
except the USB-Blaster is on the board…
The Backup:
FPGAs Suck
but recreating this project is easy
all code, 3d models and guides will be available shortly 
at https://github.com/UntrustworthyHardware-DC25/THP
One more thing(s)
- in a recent AMA on Reddit, AMD has publicly 
stated that they are “strongly considering” 
making the source code for their IME-
equivalent, PSP / Trustzone OPEN SOURCE 
- This is an ongoing project! I will continue to 
improve the system I have built here with 
plans for RF side channel hardening and 
increased system independence.
