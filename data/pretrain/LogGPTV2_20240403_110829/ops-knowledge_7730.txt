User: What its the best game-engine 3D to Python 3.x and easy to install on Linux (Debian 7 "wheezy")?
Assistant: If you want a game engine in python, I would recommend these:

Kivy (multiplatform)
PyGame (multiplatform)
Blender (graphical game engine made in python, multiplatform, also used for modeling)
PyOpenGL (multiplatform, 3d game engine like blender)

These are some game engines I know. You also might want to try Unity3d.
