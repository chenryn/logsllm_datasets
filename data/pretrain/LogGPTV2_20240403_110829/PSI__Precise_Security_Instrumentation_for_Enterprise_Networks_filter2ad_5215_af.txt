it does not speciﬁcally tackle the kinds of security, policy, and
scalability challenges we describe here. These trends further
corroborate our arguments that the PSI architecture is viable,
and likely the inevitable culmination in response to today’s
security woes.
IX. CONCLUSIONS
Existing network security mechanisms leave defenders at
a disadvantage as they have fundamental limitations in terms
of: (1) isolation, leading to policies interfering with each other;
(2) context, preventing the defenders from creating a truly cus-
tomized response; and (3) agility, constraining the defenders’
abilities to specify dynamic security postures. To address these
pain points, PSI leverages recent advances in software-deﬁned
networking and network functions virtualization to enable iso-
lated, context-aware, and agile security postures. We addressed
key challenges in developing expressive policy abstractions
and scalable orchestration mechanisms. We showed that PSI
is scalable and can be an enabler for new security capabilities
that would be exceedingly difﬁcult to implement with legacy
solutions.
We identify two natural directions for future work: (1) bet-
ter user interfaces for operators to express PSI-based policies
and (2) support for cross-device policies (e.g., when the IPS
ﬂags a host, the administrator may want to increase monitoring
ﬁdelity for other hosts in the same subnet.) Finally, we
acknowledge that PSI is not a panacea and can be vulnerable to
covert channels used by attackers; e.g., malware via encrypted
cloud storage. That said, PSI is a signiﬁcant step that can help
restore some balance in favor of defenders in the constant
tussle with more advanced adversaries.
