### Feature Request

**Current Behavior:**
Currently, we are only able to edit the props that have been explicitly passed to a component. For example:

**Expected Behavior:**
We should be able to modify other props (e.g., `loading`, `type`, etc.) that were not initially passed to this specific instance of the component. This would allow for more dynamic and interactive development, similar to how Chrome DevTools enable us to add new CSS properties:

**Affected Versions:**
- React: Latest
- Browser/OS: Not specified

**Additional Information:**
- Did this work in previous versions of React? No.
