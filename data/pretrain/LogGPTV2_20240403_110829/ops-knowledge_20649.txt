User: How to Write/Read a file to/from a network folder/share using python? The application will run under Linux and network folder/share can be a Linux/Windows System.
Also, how to check that network folder/share has enough space before writing a file?
What things should i consider?
Assistant: Mount the shares using Samba, check the free space on the share using df or os.statvfs and read/write to it like any other folder.
