User: In ipython >=0.11, the %paste command is required to paste indented commands.  However, if I run an ipython shell in a remote terminal, the buffer %paste refers to is on the remote machine rather than the local machine.  Is there any way around this?
Assistant: I think this is exactly what %cpaste is for (I am always forgetting about all the things IPython does).  %cpaste enters a state allowing you to paste already formatted or indented code, and it will strip leading indentation and prompts, so you can copy/paste indented code from files, or even from an interactive Python session including leading >>> or In [1] which will be stripped.
