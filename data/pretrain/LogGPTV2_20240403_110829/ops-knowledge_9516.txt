User: I know I can find multiple answers to this question but I have a problem with the result.
I have a Windows PC with a script on it and a Linux PC that has to start the script using ssh.
The problem I am seeing is that for some reason it's using the Linux environment to run the script and not the Windows env. Is this expected and if yes how can I start a remote script (From Linux) and still use the Windows env?
Linux: Python 2.7
Windows: Python 3.4 
My example:
I am running:ssh user@host "WINDOWS_PYTHON_PATH Script.py arg1 arg2 arg3" and it fails internally at a copy command  
I can't run ssh user@host "Script.py arg1 arg2 arg3" because then it will fail to run the script because of the python version.
The way I run the command in Windows is using the same syntax "Script.py arg1 arg2 arg3" and it works.
It looks like it's using the Linux env to run the script. I would like to run the script on Windows no matter who triggers it. How can I achieve this?
Assistant: The solution to my problem is to use PATH=/cygdrive/c/WINDOWS/system32:/bin cmd /c in front of the script call, sth like: ssh user@host "PATH=/cygdrive/c/WINDOWS/system32:/bin cmd /c script" .This will run the script using in Windows env.
In my case the problem was that the script was run under cygwin env and I wanted to be run in a Windows env.
