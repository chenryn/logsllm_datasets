I was going through the "Create your first page in Symfony" tutorial, and I
noticed I was always getting a "No route found for "Get /lucky/number"" type
exception; however I was certain everything I coded was correct. After cutting
and pasting the sample code (which was identical), I noticed it worked.
The problem is here:
        /**
         *  @Route("/lucky/number/{count}")
         */
Whereas this works:
        /**
         * @Route("/lucky/number/{count}")
         */
The difference is the first annotation has a tab in front of it. This is the
bug! Seems to have an issue with tabs.
