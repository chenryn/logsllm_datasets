User: In terms of server security, how to use SSH for secure connections and file transfers, with some SSH security setup recommendations.
Assistant: SSH is a secure remote connection and file transfer protocol. It uses encrypted communication methods to keep user accounts and passwords secret and prevent hackers from intercepting and tampering with data. The following are the steps of SSH for secure connection and file transfer: 1. Install SSH client and server software. For example, the client side can use PuTTY, while the server side can use OpenSSH. 2. Enable the SSH service. It can be set using command line or GUI tools. 3. Assign user rights. Make sure each user has the necessary permissions to access and modify files without revealing too much sensitive information. 4. Set up key authentication. The public key-key pair authentication method can be used, that is, the user generates a pair of public and private keys on his own host, and uploads the public key to the server for setting. Every time an SSH connection is made, the server will verify the user's identity based on the key pair generated by the private key. 5. Partial IP prohibition and other operations. To prevent attackers from exploiting SSH vulnerabilities, you can set whitelist or blacklist settings for local IP addresses. 6. Change the default SSH port number. The default port number 22 is easy to use to try to attack, it can be changed to other ports for increased security. 7. The logging function is enabled. Enable the log recording function of the SSH service, which can record the login time, login IP address, operation records and other information of each user, which is convenient for security audit and tracking. Recommendations for SSH security settings: 1. Change random passwords or secret keys regularly. To prevent hacker attacks, use a more secure password or change the key pair as much as possible during the SSH connection. 2. Prohibit the root user from SSH remote login. Since the root authority is extremely high, there is a higher possibility of hacker attacks. It is recommended that the root user be prohibited from logging in through SSH, and only limited authority accounts are allowed. 3. Regularly update the SSH software to fix bugs and patches in time. If new security vulnerabilities are discovered, update the version in time to mitigate risks. 4. Limit the maximum number of login attempts for each account and set the blocking time. Limit connection attempts, reducing the effectiveness of attempts by hackers to obtain account passwords. 5. Penetrate the internal network through the SSH jumper and establish a secure connection. Using the SSH springboard client, encrypted access can be performed between two hosts that also support the SSH protocol through the SSH protocol to ensure data transmission security.
