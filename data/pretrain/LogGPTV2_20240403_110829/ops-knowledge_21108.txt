User: I have a Python script which process data off of a HTTP data stream and I need this script to in theory be running at all times and forever unless I kill it off manually to update it and run it again.
I was wondering what the best practice to do this was on a Unix (Ubuntu in particular) so that even if Terminal is closed etc the script continues to run in the background unless the process or server are shut down?
Thanks
Assistant: I am not sure how "best practice" this is but you could do:
Add the program to:
/etc/rc.d/rc.local
This will have the program run at startup.
If you add an '&' to the end of the line it will be run in the background.
If you dont want to run the program manually (not at startup) you could switch to another tty by pressing ctrl + alt + f1, (this opens tty1 and will work with f1 - f6) then run the command. This terminal you do not have to have open in a window so you dont have to worry about it getting closed. To return to the desktop use ctrl + alt + f7.
