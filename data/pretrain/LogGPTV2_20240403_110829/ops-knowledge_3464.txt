User: How to deal with the performance problems of web applications under high concurrency, and provide at least three solutions.
Assistant: The performance problems of web applications under high concurrency may lead to problems such as prolonged client response time, slow page loading, and high server load. The following are three solutions to the performance problems of web applications under high concurrency: 1. Increase the server hardware configuration: increase the server's processing power and concurrent access capabilities by increasing the server's hardware configuration (such as CPU, memory, storage, etc.), So as to alleviate the performance problem under high concurrency. 2. Horizontal expansion: achieve horizontal expansion by adding server nodes or distributed deployment, thereby improving the overall processing capacity and concurrent access capabilities of the system. That is to say, when the concurrency of a single server reaches the bottleneck, the load can be shared by increasing the number of servers. 3. Use caching technology: caching technology can store data in high-speed storage media to achieve fast reading and response. You can consider caching frequently accessed data to reduce the pressure on database queries. Commonly used caching technologies include memory caching, distributed caching, and static technologies. While caching technology improves system performance, it also needs to consider the real-time and consistency of cached data.
