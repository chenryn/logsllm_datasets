Hi, I'd like to know if is there a feature which is able to detect changes of
whatever element attributes. For instance, if I'm in google Maps and I drag
and drop the mouse from one location to another, it causes different
transformations in some divs of the map page. Is there a way/function to test
and detect such changes? Thanks :)
