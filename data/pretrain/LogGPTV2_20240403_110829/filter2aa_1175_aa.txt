#### Introduction to EMV
EMV, which stands for Europay, MasterCard, and Visa, is the global standard for inter-operation of integrated circuit cards (IC cards or "chip cards") and IC card-capable point of sale (POS) terminals and automated teller machines (ATMs). It is designed to authenticate credit and debit card transactions more securely than the traditional magnetic stripe technology. IC card systems based on EMV are being phased in globally under names such as "IC Credit" and "Chip and PIN."

#### Why EMV?
- **Improved Security:** EMV offers enhanced security over magnetic stripe technology.
- **Offline Verification:** Supports "offline" card verification and transaction approval.
- **Multiple Applications:** Allows multiple applications on a single card.

#### Liability Shift
- **Merchant to Bank:** In most cases, liability shifts from the merchant to the bank. However, if the merchant does not implement EMV, the liability explicitly shifts to them.
- **Cardholder Liability:** Cardholders are generally assumed to be liable unless they can unequivocally prove that they were not present for the transaction, did not authorize it, and did not inadvertently disclose their PIN.
- **PIN Verification:** With EMV, PIN verification increasingly serves as "proof" of cardholder presence.

**Example: VISA Zero Liability Fine Print (US):**
- Does not apply to ATM transactions, PIN transactions not processed by Visa, or certain commercial card transactions.
- Provisional credit amounts are provided on a provisional basis and may be withheld, delayed, limited, or rescinded by the issuer based on factors such as gross negligence, fraud, delay in reporting unauthorized use, investigation, and verification of the claim, and account standing and history.
- Immediate notification to the financial institution of any unauthorized use is required.
- The transaction must be posted to the account before provisional credit can be issued.
- For specific restrictions, limitations, and other details, consult your issuer.

**Case Study: Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC)**
- In a $81,276 fraud case, CIBC spokesman Rob McLeod stated: "Our records show that this was a chip-and-PIN transaction. This means [the customer's] personal card and personal PIN number were used in carrying out this transaction. As a result, [the customer] is liable for the transaction."

#### EMV Adoption
- **EPC Card Fraud Prevention Task Force (March 2006):** A ban on magstripe fallback was foreseen, but as of October 2011, magstripe fallback is still widely accepted.

#### EMV Vulnerabilities
- **Research Findings:** Researchers from the University of Cambridge, including S. J. Murdoch, S. Drimer, R. Anderson, and M. Bond, have demonstrated that stolen cards can be used successfully without knowing the PIN.
- **Industry Response:** The industry claims that practical attacks are difficult, and at least one bank has implemented detection and blocking procedures.

#### Skimming, Cloning, and PIN Harvesting
- **Skimmer:** A hidden electronic device that intercepts communication between the card and terminal, collecting available data.
- **Focus:** We analyze the practicality of skimming, cloning, and PIN harvesting on POS terminals, focusing on the chip interface rather than the still-effective and widely used magstripe skimming.

#### ATM Skimmers
- **Predicted Trend:** Skimming the chip will become an extremely appealing target for fraudsters.
- **Accessibility:** The chip interface is inherently accessible.
- **Detection Difficulty:** It is impossible for users to verify if the terminal has been tampered with, as the chip interface is not visible.
- **Long-Term Undetected Operation:** An EMV skimmer could go undetected for a long time and requires minimal installation effort.

#### EMV Skimmer Installation
- **Trivial Installation:** By "hooking" with a special card.
- **Power Supply:** Powered by the POS terminal itself.
- **Data Download:** Data can be downloaded using a special card recognized by the skimmer.
- **Cost-Effective:** Requires little development effort and is inexpensive.

#### EMV Smartcards
- **Filesystem Organization:** Information is stored in a filesystem organized into applications, files, and records.
- **Communication:** The terminal communicates with the card via APDU messages for reading records and issuing commands.
  - **Example:** `00A404000E315041592E5359532E4444463031` (ICC exchange)

#### Terminal and ICC Exchange
1. **Initiate Application Processing**
2. **Read Application Data**
3. **Offline Data Authentication (if indicated in the AIP)**
4. **Cardholder Verification (if indicated in the AIP)**
5. **Issuer Script Processing**

#### Reading Application Data
- **Storage Format:** Stored with BER-TLV templates and read by the terminal.
  - **Examples:**
    - **4F:** Application Identifier (VISA)
    - **5F2D:** Language Preference (itenfrde)
    - **9F1F:** Track 1 Discretionary Data
    - **57:** Track 2 Equivalent Data
    - **5F25:** Application Effective Date
    - **5F24:** Application Expiration Date
    - **5A:** Application PAN (credit card number)
    - **8E:** Cardholder Verification Method (CVM) List
    - **5F20:** Cardholder Name
    - **9F36:** Application Transaction Counter (ATC)
    - **9F17:** PIN Try Counter

#### EMV Application Data - Magstripe Clone
- **CVV Matching:** The CVV (228) matches the magstripe only for cards that do not use iCVV (introduced in January 2008 but not present on all cards).
- **Fallback Mechanism:** If a card without a readable chip is inserted, magstripe fallback is triggered on all tested terminals.
- **Cloning Limitations:** EMV skimmers cannot clone successfully to magstripe if iCVV is used.
- **Security Concerns:** The possibility of massive harvesting, protected by a 3-digit code, is not a reassuring scenario.

#### EMV Application Data - Online Usage
- **Online Transactions:** Application data can be used for Card Not Present transactions (online, phone, etc.) with parties that do not check the Card Security Code (CVV, CVV2, etc.) and do not employ 3-D Secure (Verified by Visa, MasterCard SecureCode).
- **Security Risks:** Many websites do not check the security code, making them vulnerable to fraud. One of the authors experienced fraud on such sites while preparing this presentation.

#### Offline Data Authentication
- **Methods:** Depending on the chip technology, three methods are available:
  - **Static Data Authentication (SDA)**
  - **Dynamic Data Authentication (DDA)**
  - **Combined Data Authentication (CDA)**
- **Usage:** Used by the terminal to validate the authenticity of the card, enabling offline transactions where supported.
- **ATM Transactions:** Always online, never using offline data authentication.
- **Mandate:** Visa and MasterCard require all cards issued after 2011 to use DDA.

#### Static Data Authentication (SDA) Cards
- **Technology:** Cheapest and most widely used.
- **Validation:** Selected records are signed with a static signature.
- **Symmetric Key:** Used for online transactions.
- **Offline PIN Verification:** Always cleartext.
  - **Tags:**
    - **8F:** Certificate Authority Public Key Index (PKI)
    - **90:** Issuer PK Certificate
    - **9F32:** Issuer PK Exponent
    - **92:** Issuer PK Remainder
    - **93:** Signed Static Application Data

#### Dynamic Data Authentication (DDA) Cards
- **Technology:** More expensive and less common as of 2011.
- **Validation:**
  - **Static Data:** Validated against a hash within the certificate.
  - **Dynamic Data:** The terminal asks the card to sign data + a random number with the ICC PK.
- **ICC PK:** Embeds the PAN, limiting private key usage to this card.
- **Offline PIN Verification:** Can be cleartext or enciphered.
  - **Tags:**
    - **8F:** Certificate Authority Public Key Index (PKI)
    - **90:** Issuer PK Certificate
    - **9F46:** ICC PK Certificate
    - **9F32:** Issuer PK Exponent
    - **9F47:** ICC PK Exponent
    - **92:** Issuer PK Remainder
    - **9F48:** ICC PK Remainder
    - **9F49:** Dynamic Data Authentication Data Object List (DDOL)

#### Chip Cloning
- **SDA Cards:** Can be cloned and used without a PIN for offline transactions only ("Yes" card).
- **DDA Cards:** Clones are ineffective for both offline and online transactions. However, a valid DDA card can be used to pass offline authentication and perform a fake offline transaction (not tied to the authentication).
