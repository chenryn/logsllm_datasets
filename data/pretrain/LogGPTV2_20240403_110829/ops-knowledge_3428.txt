User: I'm currently building a web application and I would like my users to have their own URLs to identify them. I could either do this using subdomains or using folders and am wondering what are the advantages and disadvantages of either one.
I really like the folder solution because my URL mapping would be fairly easy. I have read about auto-generating subdomains and one solution was to create virtual hosts and then restart my nginx. It's a solution but I would prefer not to have to restart my web server everytime a new account is created. If there are any other ways on how to do automated subdomain creation, that would be great as well!
Thanks!
Assistant: I think directories are the way to go. I believe it would be easier to adapt Django to the directories way much easier than to subdomains. And as one user commented you can avoid restarting your server each time.
I prefer to keep subdomains reserved for system use. Users should get their own directories instead. This is not a rule, just my preference.
