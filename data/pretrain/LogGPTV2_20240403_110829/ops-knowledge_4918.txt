User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Need leading zero for batch script using %time% variable I came across a bug in my DOS script that uses date and time data for file naming.  The problem was I ended up with a gap because the time variable didn't automatically provide leading zero for hour &lt; 10.  So running> echo %time% gives back: ' 9:29:17.88'.

Does anyone know of a way to conditionally pad leading zeros to fix this?

More info:
My filename set command is:

set logfile=C:\Temp\robolog_%date:~-4%%date:~4,2%%date:~7,2%_%time:~0,2%%time:~3,2%%time:~6,2%.log


which ends up being: C:\Temp\robolog_20100602_ 93208.log (for 9:23 in the morning).

This question is related to this one.  

Thanks

Assistant: A very simple way is to just replace the leading space with zero:
echo %TIME: =0%
outputs:
09:18:53,45
