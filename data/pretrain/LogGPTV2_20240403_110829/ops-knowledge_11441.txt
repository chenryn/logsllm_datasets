User: I am trying to install bigfloat in Python 3.2 on a Windows 7 machine. The documentation says that I first need to install GMP and MPFR. I have downloaded both of these to my desktop (as well as the bigfloat package). However as they are C packages I am not sure how to install them in python (I have tried to find a clear explanation for the last several hours and failed). Can any one either tell me what I need to do or point me to a tutorial? Thanks a lot, any help is greatly appreciated.
Assistant: There are two versions of gmpy - version 1 (aka gmpy) and version 2 (aka gmpy2). gmpy2 includes MPFR. If you install gmpy2 then you probably don't need bigfloat since the functionality of MPFR can be directly accessed from gmpy2. 
Disclaimer: I maintain gmpy and gmpy2.
