I am attempting to install the `bigfloat` package in Python 3.2 on a Windows 7 machine. According to the documentation, I need to first install GMP and MPFR. I have downloaded both libraries, as well as the `bigfloat` package, and placed them on my desktop. However, since GMP and MPFR are C libraries, I am unsure how to install them for use with Python. Despite several hours of searching, I have not found a clear explanation. Could anyone provide me with instructions or direct me to a tutorial? Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.

There are two versions of the `gmpy` library: version 1 (referred to as `gmpy`) and version 2 (referred to as `gmpy2`). The `gmpy2` version includes support for MPFR. If you install `gmpy2`, you may not need the `bigfloat` package, as the functionality provided by MPFR can be accessed directly through `gmpy2`.

**Disclaimer:** I am the maintainer of both `gmpy` and `gmpy2`.

This should make the communication clearer and more professional.
