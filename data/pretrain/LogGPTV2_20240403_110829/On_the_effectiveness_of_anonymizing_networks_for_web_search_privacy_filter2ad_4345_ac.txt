### Analysis of Query Identification and Classification

#### Unique Keywords and Query Identification
The unique keywords in the distribution are believed to be significant contributors to query identification. These keywords, as depicted in Figure 7, play a crucial role in distinguishing user queries.

#### Accuracy Observations
From Figures 4, 5, and 6, it is evident that the average accuracies (i.e., the fraction of correctly classified queries) are reasonable. In most cases, a certain fraction of user queries can be accurately classified. Specifically, the average accuracy across the 60 users of interest is 25.95% when \( N = 100 \), and this decreases to 18.95% when \( N = 1000 \). These results indicate that at least a quarter of the users' queries can be easily identified. The misclassification rates are also very low in almost all cases.

#### Factors Influencing Accuracies
- **Number of Queries**: As shown in Figure 4, the accuracies tend to increase with the number of queries posed by the user. This can be attributed to the fact that fewer users pose a large number of queries, making their queries more identifiable.
- **Query Length**: Figure 5 illustrates that longer queries (more than 6 words) are more identifiable. This is because only a small fraction of users issue such long queries, as seen in Figure 2.
- **Sensitivity of Query Content**: From Figure 6, it is observed that accuracies increase with the sensitivity of the query content. This follows the trend that users who stand out are more easily identifiable.

#### Reasons Behind the Accuracies
To understand these results, we analyzed the word usage distribution among the 1000 users. By breaking down the queries into word vectors, we identified patterns in word usage that contribute to the classification accuracy.

#### Decrease in Accuracies with Increasing \( N \)
The decrease in accuracies as \( N \) (the number of users using web search over an anonymizing network) increases can be explained by the following:
- **Training Set Size**: As \( N \) increases, the size of the training set for other users also increases, leading to a higher likelihood of similar query words appearing in the training data. This reduces the chances of classifying a query as belonging to a specific user.
- **Example**: For an AOL user, the query "j c penney catalog" was correctly identified as the user's query when \( N = 100 \) because the terms "j c penney" and "catalog" had occurred in the user's training set. However, when \( N \) increased to 300, the same query was not labeled as the user's query due to the increased occurrences of these terms in the training sets of other users.

#### Influence of Time Gap
The web content that users are interested in varies over time. A time gap between the test and training data sets can make it harder to de-anonymize the data, as the common content decreases. However, prior research [20] shows that users tend to repeat exact queries, a behavior known as "Bookmarking." This repetition helps in identifying at least a small fraction of user queries even with a time gap. For example, for two AOL users, the percentage of repeated queries (assumed to be bookmark queries) was less than 6%, but the machine learning accuracies were higher than 58%, and even above 90% for one user.

### Related Work
The problem of query classification is similar to authorship attribution, which has a long history. Early studies focused on modeling unique author styles through text characteristics. With the advent of electronic data, the problem has become more challenging due to the shorter length of texts and the variability in writing styles. Recent studies show that "Vanity searches" (queries containing personally identifying information) significantly contribute to query sender identification, even when privacy-preserving tools are used.

### Conclusions and Future Work
This paper investigates the problem of identifying a user's queries from a pool of queries received by a search engine over an anonymizing network. We demonstrated that an adversarial search engine, equipped with a short-term search history, can extract user queries using only the query content and off-the-shelf machine learning classifiers. Specifically, we showed that queries from 60 selected users can be identified with 25.95% average accuracy when \( N = 100 \), and 18.95% when \( N = 1000 \). Although the average accuracies are not high, some users can be identified with up to 80-98% accuracy even when \( N = 1000 \).

Our results cast doubt on the effectiveness of anonymizing web search queries through anonymizing networks. Future work will focus on improving the attacks by incorporating additional information such as query timestamps, exit node IP addresses, and long-term search histories. We also plan to use geographical locality and contextual information for further improvements.
