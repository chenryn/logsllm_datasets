**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Password Policies

Applications and devices that use default usernames and passwords should have these credentials changed immediately after installation and before deployment to a production environment. [66] Additionally, SSH keys used by applications should be updated periodically and properly secured.

Password policies should aim to minimize, if not eliminate, the reuse of passwords across different user accounts. This is particularly important for employees who may use the same credentials for personal accounts that are not protected by enterprise security measures.
