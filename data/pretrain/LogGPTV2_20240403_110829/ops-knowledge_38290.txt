User: I just downloaded and installed Anaconda on my Windows computer. However, I am having trouble executing .py files using the command prompt. How can I get my computer to understand that the python.exe application is in the Anaconda folder so it can execute my .py files?
Assistant: If you get the following error:

can't open file 'command.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory

Then follow this steps to fix it:

Check that you are in the correct directory where the Python file is.

If you are not in the correct directory, then change the current working directory with cd path. For instance: cd  F:\COURSE\Files.

Now that you are in the directory where your .py file is, run it with the command python app.py.
