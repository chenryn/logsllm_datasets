Assistant: This log chunk shows that the kernel detected and corrected 23 DDR errors on rank 0, symbol 20, bit 3. Additionally, the kernel detected and corrected 15 floating point alignment exceptions multiple times. Finally, the kernel generated two cores, 7818 and 15063, and detected and corrected 5 floating point alignment exceptions.
