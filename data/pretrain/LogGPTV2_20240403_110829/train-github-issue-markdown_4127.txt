Pulling in https://github.com/jakevdp/JSAnimation (which hasn't changed in
over a year) would greatly enhance the experience of using animations in the
notebook with stock matplotlib. Also, like trendvis, oceancm, and viscm, this
would move an very useful matplotlib-based tool into our fold.
The core implementation of JSAnimation is just two parts:
  * A new writer, HTMLWriter, which also includes some icons for the HTML controls
  * IPython notebook display hook code
The `HTMLWriter` clearly makes sense in matplotlib (alongside `FFMpegWriter`,
etc.). I'm not sure what to do with the IPython display code. Adding it as a
`_repr_html` might not be too bad.
Thoughts?
