User: I have written a piece of code in python, in which I am asking questions and users should give their input. Sometimes, these questions are difficult for the user to understand(they are non-english). So most of the time they want to copy paste the sentence into google translate. However, since this code is running in the command prompt,they have to select the text and using "right click --> copy" they can copy the text into google translate. Sometimes, by mistake the press "ctrl+c"(it is natural for everyone to use this combination for copying). Doing this will terminate the code, and they have to start over. I need to know I can prevent this from happening. In other words, if they press "ctrl+c" nothing happens and my software doesn't abort.
thanks
Assistant: If using X, the text is normally copied to the clipboard once it's selected. Just paste it using middle mouse button or Shift+insert.
