> In that case, please cause no further interruptions or I will have to remove you from the call.
But "Do you wish to take command?" is the most useful phrase for dealing with that kind of executive hostile takeover.

### Executive Swoop
![051](../../assets/slides/incident_response/incident_response.051.jpeg)
_051. Executive swoop._
This is a class of problem we call Executive Swoop. Well, actually it's "Executive Swoop and Poop", but I was asked not to put that on the slide.
The previous example isn't typical though. It's rare for someone to come in and purposefully start causing a problem like that.
We're going to look at some more common examples of executive swoop next, but it's worth noting that **none of these happen maliciously**. No executive joins with the intent of hindering the process, they’re trying to motivate people and find out what’s going on. It’s their business too! Making sure your executives understand why these things are a problem is important, so be sure to followup after an incident if these things happen.

### Let's Resolve This in 10 Minutes
![052](../../assets/slides/incident_response/incident_response.052.jpeg)
_052. Let's try and resolve this in 10 minutes._
> Let's try and resolve this in 10 minutes please!
This one definitely wasn't said by anyone at PagerDuty ever. Nope. Definitely not.
On the surface this seems pretty benign. The executive is merely trying to motivate staff and encourage them to solve the problem quickly, right?
Unfortunately, that's not how others on the call are going to interpret it. Instead they're more likely to be sarcastically thinking "Well, I was going to take an hour, but since you've said that, OK I'll do it in 10 minutes". It assumes people aren’t already working as hard as possible to solve the problem. It demotivates responders, and adds additional stress.
Your job as IC is to nip this in the bud and keep things on track.

### Keep Comments Until The End
![053](../../assets/slides/incident_response/incident_response.053.jpeg)
_053. Keep your comments until the end. [Docs Reference](../../training/incident_commander.md#executive-swoop-anti-motivation)_
To keep things moving, you need to remind the executive of what's going on, and direct questions to be handled at a later time. It may come across slightly abrupt, but it gets the point across quickly and allows you to keep moving. Most people will pick up on the subtext here.
> We're in the middle of an incident, please keep your comments until the end.
Remember, **don't be mean**, just state the facts and keep things flowing. We're not trying to shame people or make them feel bad, we're trying to keep our incident moving towards a resolution.
---
### Spreadsheet of Affected Customers
![054](../../assets/slides/incident_response/incident_response.054.jpeg)
_054. Can I get a spreadsheet of affected customers?_
> Can I get a spreadsheet of all affected customers?
Another one that's definitely never been mentioned on any PagerDuty incident response call ever.
An exec joins the call and wants to get a list of impacted customers. The problem is that in order to find that out, we'll need to take someone away from the effort of responding to the incident, at a time when we need them most. If you can spare the resources, then feel free to dedicate some to finding the information. But more often than not you wont have the resources to spare. So we can just tell the executive that.

### The Incident Takes Priority
![055](../../assets/slides/incident_response/incident_response.055.jpeg)
_055. The incident takes priority. [Docs Reference](../../training/incident_commander.md#executive-swoop-wants-information)_
> We can either get you that list, or fix the incident. Not both. The incident takes priority.
Note how this isn't phrased as a question, it wasn't "We can either get you that list or fix the incident, which do you want?". The **incident commander has already made the decision**, they're simply letting the executive know what it is.
Remember that the IC is still in charge, you don't want to cede decision making to someone else during an incident.

### Really a SEV-1?
![056](../../assets/slides/incident_response/incident_response.056.jpeg)
_056. Is this really a SEV-1?_
> Is this really a SEV-1?
Oh look, it's another one that's never ever happened at PagerDuty. We used to have a really big problem with this one. We'd start incident response calls, then spend the first 10 minutes arguing over whether it was a `SEV-3` or a `SEV-2`. By the time we were finished, we would be 10 minutes into a `SEV-1` and have made no progress.
So now we have a rule. We don't discuss incident severity during the call. If we can't decide between two, we always assume it's the higher severity and move on.
Don't litigate severities during an incident. It's a waste of time.
---
### Treating as a SEV-1
![057](../../assets/slides/incident_response/incident_response.057.jpeg)
_057. We're treating this as a SEV-1. [Docs Reference](../../training/incident_commander.md#executive-swoop-questioning-severity)_
So the IC will need to make it clear we don’t discuss, and that we’re treating it as a `SEV-1`. It may turn out to be a `SEV-4`, who knows, it doesn’t matter. That's a discussion for the postmortem.
> We do not discuss incident severity during the call. We're treating this as a SEV-1.
Once you’ve spun up the gears of incident response, you may as well finish the process, if anything it just gives you all more practice.

### Notify Stakeholders
![058](../../assets/slides/incident_response/incident_response.058.jpeg)
_058. Notify stakeholders._
Pretty much all of these examples of executive swoop can be pre-empted by **involving stakeholders in the process**, giving them a way to stay up to date.
At PagerDuty we have a separate Slack room just for incident updates. It's less noisy than our main response room, and gives succinct updates for folks who want it. This allows execs to stay in the loop, and also ask questions without affecting the main response. In our process, the Internal Liaison is responsible for monitoring and updating that channel.
Stakeholders are not allowed to talk on our response call, or in our main incident response chat room. They must take all discussion to the updates room or via the Internal Liaison. The Incident Commander is responsible for keeping our primary communication channels free of those types of discussions or questions, and direct people towards the Internal Liaison.
---
### Belligerent Responder
![059](../../assets/slides/incident_response/incident_response.059.jpeg)
_059. The belligerent responder._
There are other things than can hinder your response though that don't fall under the category of executive swoop. This one we call the belligerent responder. It was originally called _The Drunk Engineer_, but again, I was asked not to put that in the slide.
There are plenty of awkward situations that can present themselves on response calls. There can be big ego’s and strong opinions. What do you do when someone on the call is being belligerent and hampering the response process?
You need to be firm, and let them know what will happen if they continue.
---
### Disruptive
![060](../../assets/slides/incident_response/incident_response.060.jpeg)
_060. You're being disruptive. [Docs Reference](../../training/incident_commander.md#the-belligerent-responder)_
> You're being disruptive. Please stop, or I will have to remove you from the call.
State the facts, **give them a way out to save face**, but state what will happen if they don’t. No second chances, follow through on the action if they don’t respond. It can be harsh, but that’s what needs to be done.
Again, we've phrased this in a particular way. We said "I will have to remove you", rather than "I will remove you". It makes it seem like the decision is out of your hands and that you'll be forced to do it. It can make it less personal and less likely to cause awkward problems after the call is over.
---
### Do Responders Get Tired?
![061](../../assets/slides/incident_response/incident_response.061.jpeg)
_061. Do responders get tired?_
Another problem that can pop up during a response is when we have long running incidents.
Do we use the same IC for a 12 hour incident? Do IC's even get tired? Well, of course they do! They're people too. This is another human cost associated with incident response that you want to try and minimize.
All of the roles in the response process can be mentally fatiguing. When you get tired you start to forget things and make mistakes, so it's important to try and keep a fresh perspective as often as you can.
---
### Handovers Are Encouraged
![062](../../assets/slides/incident_response/incident_response.062.jpeg)
_062. Handovers are encouraged._
For this reason, we **actively encourage handovers** in our process. Usually every hour or so is what we recommend, but it's at the discretion of the people involved. 3 hours would be the absolute upper limit where we would start requiring a handover.
???+ aside hide-arrow "Make sure to rest after handing over."
    It can be very tempting after handing over command to want to stay on the call and listen in, to try and stay on top of things and see how things are going. **Avoid this at all costs.** Once handing over your role to someone else, you should leave the response call and all associated chat rooms. Take a break away from anything related to the incident.
    You may be required to take the role again later if the incident is very long running. If you've stayed listening in the entire time, then while you would be up to speed, you would still be fatigued and would not be able to respond as efficient as if you'd taken a real break.
Handing over command is important, and really easy. Get the new IC up to speed out-of-band from the main discussion. We privately message on Slack for example. If you have a deputy, then it's even better, because they would already be on the call and up to speed.
Then you handover.
---
### Handover
![063](../../assets/slides/incident_response/incident_response.063.jpeg)
_063. Handover. [Docs Reference](../../training/incident_commander.md#transfer-of-command)_
State that you are handing over command, and then the new IC begins as if it were a new call. Simple!
Since we want to be able to handover, it's important to have as many trained IC's as you can. The more you have, the better. Ideally you want enough for at least a daily rotation.
??? aside "How do you get lots of trained Incident Commands?"
    This is a question we get a lot, and not something we have a golden solution for. Many people are hesitant to take on the responsibilities of being an IC in addition to their current work and on-call responsibilities, which is a perfectly valid concern. One of the best ways we found to increase the pool of Incident Commanders is to encourage folks outside of normal engineering teams to take on the role. Those who wouldn't normally be part of an on-call rotation. Not only can they provide an outside perspective during incidents that is sometimes missing, but it can also help to build further empathy with others in the organization who regularly go on-call.

### Anti-Patterns
_![064](../../assets/slides/incident_response/incident_response.064.jpeg)_
_064. Anti-Patterns. [Docs Reference](../../resources/anti_patterns.md)_
Let’s talk about some [anti-patterns](../../resources/anti_patterns.md). Things which seem like they would help incident response, but really don’t. Knowing these now will save you the headaches and growing pains we went through.
---
### Getting Everyone on the Call
![065](../../assets/slides/incident_response/incident_response.065.jpeg)
_065. Getting everyone on the call. [Docs Reference](../../resources/anti_patterns.md#getting-everyone-on-the-call)_
Believe it or not, we used to page every single engineer at PagerDuty whenever we had a `SEV-2`. I'm not joking. It was horrible. It worked great when we only had 5 engineers, less so when we had 50.
It's important to **maintain an effective [span of control](../../training/glossary.md#span-of-control)** during an incident. No one person should have more than ~7 people reporting to them. Any more than that and you have too many cooks in the kitchen.
Waking up 30 engineers at 3am causes untold damage. Please don't do it.
---
### Not Letting Responders Leave
![066](../../assets/slides/incident_response/incident_response.066.jpeg)
_066. Not letting responders leave. [Docs Reference](../../resources/anti_patterns.md#forcing-everyone-to-stay-on-the-call)_
Remember I mentioned at the beginning that one of our goals is to reduce the cost associated with an incident? That includes the human cost. Waking people up at 3am is costly. But keeping those people on a call in which they can’t do anything is even worse.
So if some responders are no longer needed, let them leave the call. Your co-workers time is more costly than servers, don’t burn them out!
I would recommend you not list everyone you want to leave the call, since you might miss people. Better to say who you want to stay, that way it also solidifies who you want to stay too. For example,
