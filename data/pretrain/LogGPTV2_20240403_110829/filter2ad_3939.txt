Graph Mining: Laws, Generators and Tools

Abstract 
How do graphs look like? How do they evolve over time? How can we generate realistic-looking 
graphs?  We  review  some  static  and  temporal  ‘laws,’  and  we  describe  the  “Kronecker'”  graph 
generator,  which  naturally  matches  all  of  the  known  properties  of  real  graphs.  Moreover,  we 
present  tools  for  discovering  anomalies  and  patterns  in  two  types  of  graphs,  static  and  time-
evolving. For the former, we present the ‘CenterPiece’ subgraphs (CePS), which expects q query 
nodes (eg., suspicious and finds the node that is best connected to all q of them  (eg., the master 
mind of a criminal group). We also show how to compute CenterPiece subgraphs efficiently. For 
the time evolving graphs, we present tensor-based methods, and apply them on real data, like the 
DBLP author-paper dataset, where they are able to find natural research communities, and track 
their evolution. Finally, we also briefly mention some results on influence and virus propagation on 
real graphs, as well as on the emerging map/reduce approach and its impact on large graph mining..
