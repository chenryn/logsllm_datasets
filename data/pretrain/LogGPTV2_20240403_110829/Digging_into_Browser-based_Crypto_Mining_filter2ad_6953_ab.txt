### Analysis of Browser-Based Cryptocurrency Mining

#### 3.1 Prevalence and Distribution of Mining Scripts

**Alexa and NoCoin.org Signatures:**
- The x-axis represents the top domains, while the y-axis shows the relative share of the top 5 mining scripts (multiple per website possible).
- The prevalence of mining websites is relatively low. However, among popular Alexa-listed domains, the largest share of mining scripts is observed, up to 0.07%. This is likely because mining is more profitable on high-traffic websites.
- Coinhive, a Monero-based miner, is the most prevalent, used by over 75% of the mining sites.
- Other notable miners include Authedmine, a variant of Coinhive that requires explicit user consent, and wp-monero, a WordPress plugin, though their usage is significantly lower.
- Additional miners with smaller shares, such as Cryptoloot (a Coinhive clone), were also identified.
- Manual inspection of a random subset revealed some false positives, such as cpmstar, a gaming ad network that did not contain mining code.
- For the once-popular jsMiner, only 31 instances were found across all datasets.

**Key Takeaway:**
- The prevalence of mining in landing pages according to the NoCoin list is low. Most miners are Monero-based, with Coinhive being the most dominant (>75%).

#### 3.2 Chrome-Based Analysis

**Complementary Analysis:**
- To detect mining behavior beyond the NoCoin list, we analyzed patterns when executing web pages.
- Most JavaScript miners use WebAssembly (Wasm) for efficient Proof-of-Work (PoW) calculations. Wasm is a binary instruction format supported by modern browsers, enabling efficient execution of compiled code.
- Communication with backend servers often uses WebSockets.
- We instrumented a Chrome browser using the Chrome Dev Protocol to capture WebSocket communication and dump Wasm code.
- Page load timing was managed by waiting for the load event and setting timers for DOM changes, with a maximum timeout of 15 seconds.
- We saved the first 65 kB of the final HTML for comparison with the NoCoin list.

**Measurements:**
- Due to the time-consuming nature of this analysis, we focused on the .org zone and the Alexa Top 1M.
- Domains were prefixed with `http://www.` to follow redirects to HTTPS if necessary, allowing us to analyze both secure and non-secure websites.
- We built signatures from Wasm code by combining and hashing functions, creating a database of approximately 160 different assemblies, which we categorized based on distinctive features like Websocket communication or specific operations.

**Findings:**
- Table 1 summarizes our findings for the Alexa Top 1M and the .org TLD from measurements in May 2018.
- Most Wasm code contains mining functionality, with Coinhive being the most prevalent.
- Applying the NoCoin block list to the executed HTML revealed that many sites classified as miners by NoCoin do not actually embed mining Wasm code, indicating false positives.
- Conversely, some sites with Wasm mining signatures were not detected by the NoCoin list, indicating false negatives.

**Classification:**
- We used the Symantec RuleSpace engine to categorize the mining websites.
- Table 3 shows the top 5 categories assigned by RuleSpace for both the NoCoin list matches and our signature-based approach.
- A diverse set of categories was observed, with RuleSpace classifying more Alexa domains than .org domains.
- Notable differences in top categories between NoCoin and our approach were observed, such as Gaming vs. Pornography and Gaming vs. Religion, possibly due to the gaming ad network.

**Key Takeaway:**
- Miners are embedded on websites today. Simple block lists are ineffective, and our signature-based approach can detect sites beyond the NoCoin block list. Coinhive remains the most used mining service.

#### 4. The Coinhive Service

**Overview:**
- Coinhive provides a mining service with the slogan "Monetize Your Business With Your Users’ CPU Power." It is the most widely used mining service, as observed in Section 3.
- Coinhive offers a highly optimized Monero JavaScript miner, keeping 30% of the mined reward. They also provide additional services like Captcha and short link forwarding.

**Process:**
- A unique token is assigned to each Coinhive user (e.g., a website owner) for API calls.
- Upon a website visit, the miner loads, connects to the Coinhive pool, and authorizes with the user’s token to receive PoW input.
- Valid hashes are committed to the Coinhive pool, and users receive 70% of the block reward.

**4.1 Short Link Forwarding Service**

**Analysis:**
- Coinhive's short link forwarding service works similarly to common short link services but requires computing a configurable number of hashes before resolving the link.
- Links follow a simple structure: `https://cnhv.co/[a-z0-9]`.
- As of February 2018, there were 1,709,203 active short links, with a power-law distribution showing a few heavy users creating a large number of links.
- Figure 4 shows the distribution of required hash computations. The majority of links can be resolved in less than 51 seconds, but some require millions of hashes, suggesting either no desire for resolution or misconfigurations.

**Link Destinations:**
- We resolved links requiring fewer than 10K hashes and a random sample of 1,000 links from the top ten Coinhive users.
- Most links point to streaming and filesharing services.
- Table 4 shows the top 10 domains, primarily in entertainment, music, and filesharing categories.

**Top Categories:**
- Using the RuleSpace engine, we classified the unbiased dataset into categories.
- Table 5 lists the top 10 categories, showing a diverse set of categories, unlike the top 10 users, where filesharing and streaming were dominant.

**Key Takeaway:**
- Coinhive's link forwarding service is dominated by a few users, mostly redirecting to streaming and filesharing sites. Most short links can be resolved within minutes, but some require infeasible amounts of computation.

#### 4.2 Estimating the Network Size

**Methodology:**
- To understand the available mining power and payouts, we need to identify blocks in the Monero blockchain mined through Coinhive.
- When a block is mined, the PoW input and the succeeding block's Merkle tree root are compared to confirm the block's origin.
- If the transactions in the succeeding block match the Merkle tree root in the PoW input, it indicates the block was mined by the Coinhive network.

**Key Takeaway:**
- Many websites use Coinhive, but the number of users visiting these sites and the achievable payouts remain unclear. Our methodology helps identify blocks mined through Coinhive, providing insights into the network size and mining power.
