User: How to upgrade the version of the application in the Kubernetes cluster?
Assistant: Upgrading the version of the application can be done through the following steps: 1. Modify the image version number of the Deployment or StatefulSet, for example, modify the YAML file through the kubectl edit command, or use the kubectl set image command to achieve. 2. Execute the kubectl apply command to update the configuration file of the Kubernetes object. 3. Wait for the new Pod to be created and run. You can use the kubectl get pods command to view the status of Pods. 4. If you need to support rolling update and rollback operations, you can use the kubectl rollout command for management. Among them, the kubectl rollout status command will display the update progress, kubectl rollout history can view the historical version records, and kubectl rollout undo can roll back to the previous version. It should be noted that when upgrading the application version, be sure to verify that the new version is working properly to avoid possible problems. You can use the kubectl logs command to view container logs, or use the kubectl port-forward command to test whether the service is available.
