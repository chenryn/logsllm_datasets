User: I developed a command-line utility which needs to be called from a Java GUI application. The team in charge on the Java GUI would like to bind my command-line application to a button in the GUI; the Python application is such that at the time we have no time or interest in rewriting it in Java.
I have no experience whatsoever in Java, so I ask you:
What is the best way to bind a command-line based Python application to a button in a Java-based GUI application?
I am very concerned about exception management (how to tell Java that Python failed).
Thanks.
Assistant: Have you considered jython? You can:
1) use it to run python scripts (allowing it to call Java classes) 
2) compile python into class files, making them usable by normal Java code without jython being present at runtime
I've only used it in the first pattern, but I've seen tonnes of docs on the second.
