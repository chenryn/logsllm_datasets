User: I installed Anaconda via command line. The bash file.
If Im in bash, I can open and use anaconda, like notebooks, ipython, etc.
If I change my shell to ZSH, all the anaconda commands appear like "not found".
How I can make it work in zsh? 
I use a Mac with OSx Sierra.
Thanks in advance,
Assistant: From their docs (This worked for me): If you are on macOS Catalina, the new default shell is zsh. You will instead need to run source <path to conda>/bin/activate followed by conda init zsh.
For my specific installation (Done by double clicking the installer), this ended up being source /opt/anaconda3/bin/activate
