2017 Oct - Protective order vacated
ProPoublica and Yale Media Freedom 
and Information Access Clinic request 
that the protective order be vacated.
OCME does not oppose.
Order vacated, reports unsealed, and

Quality Control Test of Forensic Statistical Tool 
(FST) Version 2.0 - June 2011
First made public in October 2017:
“Twelve samples that were previously evaluated with FST in August 2010 were re-
evaluated….
Two samples had one locus each that displayed such values [i.e. were removed].”
Only 12/439 mixtures studied in validation were re-evaluated. Only two of those 
exhibited data-dropping behavior (at one locus each).
In June 2018, records from 16 additional “Quality Control Test” were produced 
under NY’s Freedom of Information Law (FOIL).

Unfortunately, this is not entirely 
surprising
Washington v. Emmanuel Fair
In a case involving evidence analyzed by the TrueAllele® system, Mr. Fair’s team 
requested the TrueAllele® source code and development materials in 2016.
Responses included…
Washington v. Emmanuel Fair
Declaration of Dr. Mark Perlin, TrueAllele® developer
“There is no way to actually use source code in a validation study, which tests the 
reliability of an executable computer program.”
Washington v. Emmanuel Fair
Declaration of Dr. Michael Gorin, Professor of Medicine, UCLA
“Since it is essential that one conducts testing with a compiled and operational 
version of the software, there is no benefit (nor justification) in providing 
individuals with the source code unless they intend to modify it.”
Declaration of Thomas Hebert, DNA Technical Leader for Baltimore Police
“In my opinion, I do not believe the source code is necessary for determining the 
reliability of TrueAllele because source code is not normally used in the validation 
of software programs for forensic use.”
Washington v. Emmanuel Fair
Declaration of Dr. Kevin Miller, former Lab Director of Kern Regional Crime Lab 
(CA)
“In fact, DNA analysts are required by national mandate to have taken only one 
statistics class and they have no computer science educational requirements. 
Therefore, this level of mathematics and engineering is above most individuals 
who work in the field.”
Washington v. Emmanuel Fair
Declaration of Dr. Kevin Miller, former Lab Director of Kern Regional Crime Lab 
(CA)
“Moreover, it strikes me has highly irregular that any one particular step in any one 
particular workflow would suddenly become singled out as an issue for source 
code revelation. If one is to discuss error in DNA testing, then would one not want 
to capture an error rate for the entire workflow?”
Washington v. Emmanuel Fair
“If one is to discuss error in DNA testing, then would one not 
want to capture an error rate for the entire workflow?”
Why would one not?

When public money used for criminal justice software, require! or at least give 
credit for: 
■
Source code
■
Software artifacts: bug reports, internal testing plans and results, software requirements 
and specifications, risk assessments, design documents, etc.
●
Lack of software standards in traditionally non-computing fields (e.g. DNA)
■
No clauses preventing third party review or publishing of defects found
■
Access to executables for third party testing
■
Scriptable interfaces to facilitate automated testing
