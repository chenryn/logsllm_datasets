When I click on a link with an ID, the link target shows up under the bar.
This is not as noticeable for functions, which have a very large title, but
here is an extreme example of what happens when I go to the docs for
`np.uint8`:

I have to scroll up a bit to see the actual link target:

If this issue is with pydata/pydata-sphinx-theme as #18549 was, I would be
more than happy to replicate it there as well.
