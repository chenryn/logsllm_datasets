User: Please describe what container technology is, and why it is getting more and more attention and use from developers?
Assistant: Container technology is a virtualization technology that can run multiple independent applications or services on a physical server. Each application or service runs in an independent container, similar to operating system-level virtualization. By isolating resources between applications or services, such as memory, disk, and network interfaces, container technology can improve system resource utilization, reduce system management and deployment costs, and enable rapid deployment and expansion of applications or services. The reason why container technology is getting more and more attention and use from developers is because it has the following advantages: 1. Lightweight: Compared with traditional virtualization technology, container technology is more lightweight and can run on smaller resources Running multiple applications or services under overhead. 2. Isolation: By isolating resources between applications or services, container technology can avoid interference between applications or services and improve the stability and security of applications or services. 3. Portability: Since container technology can run on different platforms, developers can more easily migrate applications or services from one environment to another, improving the portability of applications or services. 4. Rapid deployment and expansion: container technology can quickly deploy and expand applications or services in a short period of time, which greatly improves the development efficiency of developers and the response speed of applications or services. To sum up, container technology has the above advantages, so more and more developers start to use container technology to develop, deploy and manage applications or services.
