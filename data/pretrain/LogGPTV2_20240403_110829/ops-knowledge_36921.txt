User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题I need to configure a domain user to run a scheduled task Here is my configuration (on DC):





Note: user is just regular on the domain.

What I am missing?

When I run:

gpresult  /user  asap\deltacopy /V


I get this:

INFO: The user "asap\deltacopy" does not have RSoP data.


Which leads to another question:
If this user is never to logon to a server how this can work anyway?

Assistant: Something is wrong with the "Log on as batch job" rights.

Try gpupdate /force to push the newest GP. It also depends on what the tasks are you'd like the user to execute. If you want the user to run a script or exe, make sure that it is a local resource and not somewhere in the network on another machine. Also try making the user local administrator. Most of the time this does solve the problem. If all that does not help, make sure there are no other policies that are restricting "Log on as batch job". To rule out some of mentioned above, try to manually log on the/ a machine and start the task/s manually.

Please let me know if this worked for you.
