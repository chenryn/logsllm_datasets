Following is what I recently made using ThreeJS by importing OBJ files:  
http://devplace.in/~harman/geometry_viewer/mug.html  
http://devplace.in/~harman/geometry_viewer/cylinder.html
Users report following problem:
  * The model appears (briefly flashing) while user rotates. It appeared just fine before I applied material. User just get a blue background and the performance monitor in the bottom left corner. If he rotate the invisible model really quickly, it'll display the model briefly for a frame or two, but then goes back to blue.
Similar issue has been noticed at threeJS Editor: http://threejs.org/editor/
Model disappears on changing renderer. However, I'm not sure whether both of
these problems are same.
  * Some other set of users encountered edges / lines on the model surface even when wireframe flag was not set. See:

It looks like a renderer problem, but still not sure.
  * From above image of mug, one can see the inner yellow bottom from the outside of the mug which is unexpected.
So is it a bug(s) in ThreeJS or it should be something fixable by me?
