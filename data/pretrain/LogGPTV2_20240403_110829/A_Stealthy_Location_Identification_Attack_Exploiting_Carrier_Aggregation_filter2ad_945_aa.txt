## Abstract
This paper introduces SLIC (Stealthy Location Identification Attack), a novel method for fine-grained location tracking of cellular user devices. The attack exploits a new side channel in modern cellular networks through the widely available feature of carrier aggregation (CA). CA allows multiple base stations on different carrier frequencies to concurrently transmit to a single user, enhancing data rates. We discover that a passive adversary can infer the number of actively transmitting base stations for any user in the same macrocell. By analyzing the time series of this side channel, we show that it can form a unique fingerprint of a walking path, enabling the identification of paths taken by targeted users. We demonstrate the feasibility of SLIC in an existing LTE-A network with up to three CA capabilities and further emulate a 5G environment with up to nine CA capabilities, achieving up to 98.4% accuracy in identifying 100 different walking paths in a large office building. We also present countermeasures and discuss practical deployment suggestions for 5G networks.

## 1. Introduction
Long-Term Evolution (LTE) is the global standard for mobile broadband services, designed to prevent the direct leakage of private location information. However, recent studies have shown that adversaries can infer the locations of targeted individuals, albeit with limitations such as coarse-grained location information or the need for malware installation on victims' phones.

In this paper, we present SLIC, a novel location inference attack that overcomes these limitations and accurately identifies the walking path taken by a target user. To our knowledge, SLIC is the first attack on cellular networks effective in indoor, multi-story environments without requiring malware on the target user's phone. SLIC exploits a new side channel in carrier aggregation (CA) â€” the number of actively transmitting base stations for concurrent multi-band transmission.

The SLIC attack relies on two key observations:
1. **Path-Specific Fingerprint**: When an individual walks a path, the cellular network generates a specific time series of the side channel, which is unique to that path. This pattern, called a path fingerprint, is influenced by the physical environment, making it highly distinguishable.
2. **Publicly Available Side Channel**: The side channel information for any active user in a macrocell is broadcast unencrypted, allowing a passively monitoring adversary to obtain the fingerprints using commodity tools.

We address three main technical challenges:
1. **Fingerprint Comparison**: Standard techniques like dynamic time warping (DTW) normalize the data, losing critical location information. We use an absolute-value DTW technique to preserve location information.
2. **Noise Handling**: We model the limited downlink activity of a target user to handle potential noise in the side channel.
3. **Evaluation in Future Networks**: We develop a Wi-Fi-to-5G evaluation framework to simulate dense 5G small-cell deployments, ensuring realistic evaluation results.

Our extensive evaluation in emulated 5G networks with nine CA capabilities shows that SLIC is highly effective in typical office buildings, achieving up to 98.4% path-identification accuracy. We also provide countermeasures and deployment suggestions for 5G networks to mitigate the risk of location information leakage.

## 2. Carrier Aggregation and New Side Channel
### 2.1 Carrier Aggregation for Higher Rates
Traditionally, cellular network users are served by a single base station (primary cell). In 2010, 3GPP introduced carrier aggregation (CA) to meet increasing data consumption. CA allows users to connect to one or more additional base stations (secondary cells) for higher data rates. Initially, 3GPP supported up to four secondary cells, but this has been extended to 31 secondary cells, including unlicensed spectrum. Modern flagship phones support increasing CA capabilities, and operators worldwide deploy and utilize CA with several secondary cells.

### 2.2 The New Side Channel
The new side channel in CA operations is the number of activated secondary cells for each user equipment (UE). This information is broadcast unencrypted, making it accessible to unauthorized passive adversaries. The side channel is dependent on the UE's location and downlink activity, but we show that it is strongly influenced by the UE's location in existing LTE-A networks.

## 3. Technical Challenges and Solutions
### 3.1 Fingerprint Comparison
Standard dynamic time warping (DTW) techniques normalize the data, removing absolute values and thus critical location information. We use an absolute-value DTW technique to preserve this information during classification.

### 3.2 Noise Handling
To handle potential noise in the side channel, we model the limited downlink activity of the target user. This ensures that even with some noise, the calibrated fingerprints reliably capture unique dead spots, maintaining high path-identification accuracy.

### 3.3 Evaluation in Future Networks
To evaluate SLIC in future 5G networks, we developed a Wi-Fi-to-5G evaluation framework. This framework translates real-world experiments with densely deployed Wi-Fi access points into emulated 5G cellular network results, ensuring a realistic evaluation of dense 5G small cells.

## 4. Experimental Results
Our extensive evaluation in emulated 5G networks with nine CA capabilities in multi-story buildings shows that SLIC is highly effective in typical office buildings. In a large building, we achieved up to 98.4% path-identification accuracy among 100 different walking paths. We also confirmed that the fingerprinting mechanism is robust to minor perturbations in RF measurements.

## 5. Countermeasures and Deployment Suggestions
We provide several countermeasures against SLIC, including suggested changes to 3GPP standards and readily available partial countermeasures. Additionally, we discuss cell deployment suggestions for 5G networks to consider the risk of location information leakage early in the planning stage.

## 6. Conclusion
SLIC is a novel and stealthy location identification attack that exploits the new side channel in carrier aggregation. Our work demonstrates its effectiveness in indoor, multi-story environments and provides countermeasures and deployment suggestions to mitigate the risk in future 5G networks.
