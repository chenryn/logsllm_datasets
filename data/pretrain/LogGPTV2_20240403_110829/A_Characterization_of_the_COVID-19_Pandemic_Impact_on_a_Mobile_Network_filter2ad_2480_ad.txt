### Analysis of UK Network Traffic During the Pandemic (March - May 2020)

#### 1. Voice Traffic Analysis
Over a 10-week period from March to May 2020, we analyzed voice traffic across the UK, comparing it to the average values from Week 9. Notably, in Week 12, there was a 140% spike in the median value of voice traffic volume (Figure 9: Traffic Volume). This increase also corresponded to a significant rise in the 90th percentile value. This surge is equivalent to seven years of expected growth in voice traffic, which the Mobile Network Operator (MNO) had to accommodate within a few days.

Despite this dramatic increase, the overall traffic volume still decreased, as the rise in voice traffic did not compensate for the decline in other traffic classes. The increase in voice traffic was consistent with a rise in the average number of simultaneous voice users per cell (Figure 9: Simultaneous Users). This trend aligns with the declaration of the pandemic on March 11 and the implementation of lockdown restrictions in the UK on March 23 (Week 13).

#### 2. Packet Loss Analysis
We also examined the daily average uplink and downlink packet loss error rates per cell (Figure 9: Uplink Packet Error Loss Rate and Figure 9: Downlink Packet Error Loss Rate). While the uplink packet loss decreased during the pandemic, there was a significant increase in downlink packet loss during Weeks 10-12. This unexpected increase was due to the inter-MNO interconnection infrastructure being overwhelmed by the sudden surge in voice traffic. However, the network operators and service providers responded quickly, restoring the downlink error rate below normal levels by Week 13.

**Takeaway:** 
- A 140% spike in median voice traffic volume was observed around the time of the lockdown.
- Although the MNO was prepared for the traffic, the surge exceeded the capacity of the interconnection infrastructure between MNOs.
- The rapid response of network operators and service providers restored the network status to normal by Week 13.

### 4.3 High Density Areas

To understand regional traffic dynamics, we focused on five high-density counties: Outer London, Inner London, Greater Manchester, West Midlands, and West Yorkshire. We analyzed four performance metrics: daily uplink/downlink data traffic volume per cell, the number of active downlink users per cell, and the downlink average user throughput. We also considered the total number of users connected (both active and idle) and cell resource utilization. The analysis covered 10 weeks, from February 23 to May 10, 2020, and compared these metrics to the national average observed in Week 9 (Figure 8).

#### Key Observations:
- **Downlink Data Traffic Volume (Figure 8: Downlink Data Volume):**
  - All regions experienced a mild increase in Week 10, ranging from 9% to 17%, followed by a decrease in subsequent weeks.
  - Inner London saw the largest decrease (41%), while Outer London had the smallest (15%).

- **Active Downlink Users (Figure 8: Downlink Active Users):**
  - The number of active downlink users per cell significantly decreased in Inner London (e.g., -40% in Week 15), while it remained relatively stable or slightly increased in Outer London.
  - These trends reflect the differences between commercial/business and residential areas.

- **Uplink Data Volume (Figure 8: Uplink Data Volume):**
  - Uplink traffic volume grew in all regions in Week 10.
  - In Inner London and West Midlands, this was followed by a decrease, while in Outer London and West Yorkshire, the trend was steadier or slightly increasing.
  - The most significant contrast was again between Inner and Outer London, with Inner London seeing a 22% decrease in Week 14 and Outer London a 17% increase.

**Takeaway:**
- While the overall trends in the five counties are similar to those in the entire UK, the intensity varies significantly.
- These differences are likely correlated with the different geodemographic dynamics within these regions.

### 4.4 Geodemographic Clusters

In this section, we incorporated geodemographic classifications to analyze network performance. These classifications provide indicators of social, economic, demographic, and built characteristics of small areas. We used the geodemographic clusters provided by the ONS to group postcode areas and extract network performance statistics (Section 2.4).

#### Key Observations:
- **"Cosmopolitan" and "Ethnicity Central" Areas:**
  - These areas, characterized by high ethnic integration and young adult residents, saw a sharp decrease in the total number of users connected to the network, up to -50%.
  - There was a high correlation (+0.973 for "Cosmopolitan" and +0.816 for "Ethnicity Central") between the total number of users and downlink data volume.

- **"Rural Residents" and "Suburbanites" Areas:**
  - "Rural Residents" areas showed a low correlation (0.299) and a stable downlink data volume after the lockdown.
  - "Suburbanites" areas showed a negative correlation (-0.466), with an increase in users leading to a decrease in downlink data volume.

**Takeaway:**
- "Rural Residents" and "Cosmopolitan" areas deviated from the national trends.
- In "Rural Residents" areas, the downlink data volume remained stable, while in "Cosmopolitan" areas, a sharp decrease in users led to a dramatic reduction in downlink data volume.

### 5. London-Centric Analysis

In this section, we focused on the London area, particularly Inner London, due to its high concentration of users, high mobility, and diverse user profiles. The pandemic was particularly severe in London, making it a critical area for analysis.

#### 5.1 Network Performance
We analyzed the network performance based on data volume metrics, comparing them to the median values from Week 9 (Figure 11). The analysis was broken down by Postcode Districts within London.

#### Key Observations:
- **Downlink Data Volume (Figure 11: Downlink Data Volume):**
  - A general decrease in downlink data volume was observed, particularly in the Eastern Central (EC) and Western Central (WC) districts, where the decrease was over 80% between Weeks 14 and 19.
  - The Northern (N) district, however, saw an increase in the number of downlink users, varying between 10% and 23% in Weeks 10 to 14, while the downlink traffic volume remained stable.

- **Uplink Data Volume (Figure 11: Uplink Data Volume):**
  - Similar to downlink, the EC and WC districts experienced a significant decrease in uplink traffic volume.

**Takeaway:**
- The central postal districts of London (EC and WC) saw decreases of over 70% in downlink data traffic, primarily due to a major reduction in the number of people in the area.
- The Northern district (N) showed a different trend, with an increase in downlink users and stable traffic volume, indicating potential hot spots moving from central to northern areas.

#### 5.2 Geodemographic Clusters in London
We further analyzed the performance in relation to geodemographic clusters. Only three clusters mapped to the London area, each with distinct patterns (Figure 12).

#### Key Observations:
- **"Cosmopolitans" Cluster:**
  - Areas within this cluster, such as EC and WC, saw a sharp decrease in downlink data traffic, consistent with the severe reduction of users in these areas.

- **User Downlink Throughput:**
  - All areas followed the same trends for user downlink throughput, consistent with the UK-wide observation (Figure 8: User Downlink Throughput).

- **Uplink/Downlink Traffic Volume:**
  - Distinct patterns were observed for the three clusters, reflecting different usage patterns.

**Takeaway:**
- The "Cosmopolitans" cluster, including EC and WC, saw a significant decrease in downlink data traffic, consistent with the reduction in the number of users.
- The trends in user downlink throughput were consistent across all areas, while uplink/downlink traffic volume showed distinct patterns for the three clusters.
