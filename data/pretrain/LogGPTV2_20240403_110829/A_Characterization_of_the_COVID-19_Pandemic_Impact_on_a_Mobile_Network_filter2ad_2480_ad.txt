over the period of 10 weeks we analyze in March - May 2020,
for all the UK compared to the average of week 9.
We note that in week 12 there is a spike of 140% in the me-
dian value of voice traffic volume (Figure 9: Traffic Volume)
and a significant increase of its top 90 percentile value. This
corresponds to a predicted seven years of growth in voice
traffic in the operator’s network, which the MNO had to
accommodate in the space of few days (week 12 in Figure 9:
Traffic Volume). Though striking, we find that the increase
in voice traffic is not enough to compensate the decrease in
other traffic classes, resulting in the overall decrease in traffic
presented in the previous section. The surge in voice traffic
volume is consistent with a spike in the average number
of simultaneous voice users per cell (Figure 9: Simultane-
ous Users). This aligns with the time when the pandemic
was declared (11th of March), and the lockdown restrictions
started in the UK (23rd of March, week 13). This is an antic-
ipated result of the lockdown and the subsequent changes
in people’s mobility, since more are likely to carry on voice
conversations in these circumstances.
We report in Figure 9: Uplink Packet Error Loss Rate and
Figure 9: Downlink Packet Error Loss Rate the daily average
uplink and downlink packet loss error rate per cell respec-
tively. While the uplink packet loss decreases during the
pandemic period, we observe a significant increase in the
downlink packet loss during weeks 10-11-12, after which it
decreases below normal values. This is again unexpected, as
the radio network is less congested and there is less down-
link traffic (see previous section). The issue during these
weeks was, in fact, that the unexpected surge in the amount
of voice traffic exceeded the capacity of the inter-MNO inter-
connection infrastructure. The rapid response of the network
operators and service providers quickly restored the DL error
below the normal values.
Takeaway: We observe a spike of 140% in the median
value of voice traffic volume around lockdown. Although
the MNO was dimensioned to accommodate the traffic, this
unexpected surge exceeded the capacity of the interconnec-
tion infrastructure between MNOs. The rapid response of
the network operators and service providers restored the
network status back to normal quickly after week 13.
4.3 High Density Areas
To capture regional traffic dynamics, we now zoom into the
network performance of five counties with high density of
users in our dataset. Specifically, we analyse the network
performance in Outer London, Inner London, Greater Manch-
ester, West Midlands and West Yorkshire.
We analyze four performance metrics, namely the daily
uplink/downlink data traffic volume per cell, the number of
active downlink users per cell, and the downlink average
user throughput. We compleent this analysis by also show-
ing the total number of users connected (both active and
idle), and the cell resource utilization. We report on the delta
variation percentages of each metric per week with respect
to the nation-wide average for each metric observed in week
9 (Figure 8, plot lines marked with the region names we
mention above). We capture in our analysis 10 weeks, from
the 23rd of February until the 10th of May 2020. We observe
that while the overall trends in the five counties are similar
to those over the entire UK (Figure 8, plot lines marked UK),
the intensity of the different trends varies significantly from
one region to another.
Regarding the downlink data traffic volume (Figure 8:
Downlink Data Volume), we observe in all regions a mild
increase in week 10 (ranging between 9% and 17% depend-
ing on the region), followed by a decrease in the following
weeks reaching the minimum in weeks 17 and 18. However,
the decrease is much larger in Inner London (with a 41%
decrease) than in the other regions, which decrease by about
20%. Further, in outer London, there is the smallest decrease,
with only 15%.
We also see in Figure 8: Downlink Active Users that dur-
ing lockdown the number of active downlink users per cell
significantly decreases in Inner London (e.g., -40% in week
15), while it is almost constant and even slightly higher
in Outer London. These different trends between commer-
cial/business and residential areas are also visible for other
regions as well (i.e., West Midlands/Greater Manchester more
business compared to Yorkshire more residential).
An additional contributing factor to the decrease of traffic
and users in Inner London is the temporary relocation of
people living in Inner London to other counties outside the
city. In Section 3 we saw that approximately 10% of inferred
residents were not signalling against radio cells covering
London after lockdonw, thus hinting a potential relocation
and partially explaining the reduction in the data traffic
volume. We make a detailed analysis of the different districts
within Inner London in Section 5.
Regarding the uplink data volume (Figure 8: Uplink Data
Volume), we observe different trends across regions. The
uplink traffic volume grows for all regions in week 10. This
growth is followed by a decrease in Inner London and West
Midlands, and by a slight increase or steadier behavior in
Outer London and West Yorkshire. The highest contrast is
again in Inner/Outer London. In week 14, in Inner London,
the UL data traffic volume decreased -22%; while in the Outer
London region it increased by 17%. In the other regions, the
effects are similar, but with a lower intensity.
We conjecture these differences correlate with the dif-
ferent geodemographic dynamics within these regions. For
example, Inner London includes many business, touristic,
commercial and recreational areas, which remained largely
empty during lockdown, potentially explaining the steep
decrease in the downlink data volume in the area. To capture
these correlations, in the following section we further study
the network performance on areas with the same geodemo-
graphic profiles (Table 1). Thus, we change from the current
perspective of network performance within administrative
boundaries, to capturing performance metrics across clusters
of areas with the different geodemographic profiles.
Takeaway: We observe that while the overall trends in
five counties are similar to those in the entire UK, their
intensity varies significantly from one region to another.
We conjecture these differences correlate with the different
geodemographic dynamics within these regions.
4.4 Geodemographic Clusters
In this section, we incorporate into our analysis of network
performance during COVID-19 demographic dynamics. Geode-
mographic classifications provide summary indicators of the
social, economic, demographic, and built characteristics of
small areas. To this end, we use the geodemographic clusters
10
centers for business, commercial, recreational, educational
activities throughout the country. The pattern we observe
is different from the rest of the areas. This is likely to be
caused by a dramatic reduction of people in these places,
since are areas with a lower number of residents but with a
lot of people visiting them due to work and recreational pur-
poses. This is consistent with the observations we made in
the previous section for Inner London, where approximately
45% of postcode areas cluster within the "Cosmopolitans"
geodemographic group, while 50% of postcode cluster in the
"Ethnicity Central" group.
To further verify this correlation, in Figure 10 we show
the total number of users connected to the network, and
observe a sharp decrease of up to -50% in the "Cosmopolitan"
areas. We calculate the correlation between the total number
of users (both idle and active users) and the downlink data
volume for the geodemographic clusters. We find a high
correlation for the "Cosmopolitan" (+0.973) and for "Ethnicity
central" (+0.816) areas, low correlation for "Rural residents"
areas (0.299), and a negative correlation for "Suburbanites"
(-0.466), where the increase of users resulted in a decrease
of downlink data volume (Figure 8). In these areas, the drop
in downlink data volume is likely impacted by other factors
(e.g., offloading to WiFi, changes in applications used).
Takeaway: Areas within "Rural residents" and "Cosmopoli-
tan" geodemographic clusters deviate from the trends we
observed in UK nation wide. In the former, the average vol-
ume of downlink data traffic per cell remains largely stable
after the lockdown. Conversely, in the latter we observe a
sharp decrease of up to -50% in the total number of users
connected after lockdown, which led to a dramatic decrease
in the downlink data traffic volume.
5 LONDON-CENTRIC ANALYSIS
In this section, we focus our analysis on the London area (i.e.,
the Inner London county). London is particularly interesting
because of the large concentration of users in a single area,
high mobility, diversity in user’s profiles, and also because,
unfortunately, the pandemic was particularly severe in the
city. Our goal is to dissect how the changes in the mobility
patterns of the population residing in this region (approxi-
mately 700,000 users in our dataset) resulted in changes in
their habits of using the mobile network service.
5.1 Network Performance
Figure 11 shows the network performance evolution based
on data volume metrics, compared to median values over
week 9 within London. We break down the analysis for each
of the Postcode Districts within London, and we only depict
the median values over each week (for readability reasons).
We note a general decrease in the total volume of downlink
Figure 10: Focused analysis of network performance met-
rics on geodemographic clusters (OAC 2011 dataset). We
show the median variation per cluster (see Table 1), where
each line corresponds to a different cluster.
(Table 1) that the ONS labeled to each postcode.5 We group
the postcode areas in the corresponding geodemographic
clusters and extract the network performance statistics (Sec-
tion 2.4) per cluster. This analysis allows us to understand
potential network performance differences between groups
of areas with distinct mobility patterns across the entire UK
(e.g., rural residents areas vs. cosmopolitan areas, see Fig-
ure 6), as we already observed different behavior for different
areas in the previous section.
We find that the behaviour for most areas, with the excep-
tion of "Rural residents" and "Cosmopolitan" areas, exhibits
similar trends than the ones observed in UK nation wide,
with a decrease in downlink traffic and a stable uplink traf-
fic volume. In areas within the "Rural residents" cluster, the
average volume of downlink data traffic per cell remains
largely stable after the lockdown period.
Figure 10 shows that the average volume of downlink data
traffic per cell in areas with majority of "Cosmopolitan" resi-
dents decreased dramatically after week 13, coinciding with
the stay-at-home order. The areas within the "Cosmopoli-
tans" cluster correspond to densely populated urban areas,
with high ethnic integration, where young adults and stu-
dents reside (see Table 1). These areas include the neuralgic

traffic (Figure 11: Downlink Data Volume), as well as in the
volume of uplink traffic (Figure 11: Uplink Data Volume). The
decrease is particularly large for Eastern Central (EC) and
Western Central (WC). In the WC district, the uplink and the
downlink traffic volumes exhibited a decrease of over 80%
between weeks 14 and 19, while the EC district experienced a
similar trend, with a decrease of more than 70% compared to
week 9. These two districts cover the central area of London,
where the density of population is also lower (i.e., approxi-
mately 30,000 residents in EC compared to 400,000 residents
in SW) and includes many seasonal residents (e.g., tourists),
business and commercial areas. The decreasing volume of
data is likely due to a major reduction of people in the area,
which is consistent with the decrease we observed in the
average number of radio users per sector (see Figure 11: To-
tal Number of Users). We note a similar trend both in the
percentage of cell resources occupancy (Figure 11: Cell Re-
source Utilization) and in the average number of users per
cell (Figure 11: Downlink Active Users).
We find that the trends in the Northern (N) district detach
from the rest of the districts. In particular, we note an increase
in the number of downlink users (varying between 10% and
23% in weeks 10 to 14), while the volume of downlink traffic
keeps stable (unlike the other postcodes, where we note
a decrease). This hints towards potential hot spots in the
mobile network moving within London from central areas
(EC, WC) to the north (N).
Takeaway: Performance in the central postal districts of
London (EC and WC) differ from the rest, with decreases of
over 70% in the downlink data traffic. This is due to a major
reduction of people in the area, which is consistent with the
decrease we observed in the average number of total radio
users in those sectors.

Each line corresponds to a Postal District within London. We
show the median variation percentage (on the y axis) per
postal district, over a period of 10 weeks (on the x axis).
5.2 Geodemographic Clusters
We further dissect the performance in London in relation
to the geodemographic clusters. We find that only three
clusters map to the area of London, each with different pat-
terns. Figure 12 shows the evolution of four performance
metric over the period of analysis (median values of delta
variation percentage per week compared to corresponding
median values in week 9 in London). We find again a sharper
decrease in the areas marked as "Cosmopolitans", largely
matching the behaviour we observed in the EC and WC dis-
tricts, due to the severe reduction of users in these areas.
We find that all areas follow the same trends for the user
downlink throughput, which is consistent with the UK-wide
observation (Figure 8: User Downlink Throughput). However,
for the uplink/downlink traffic volume, we note distinct pat-
terns for the three clusters, showing distinct usage patterns
