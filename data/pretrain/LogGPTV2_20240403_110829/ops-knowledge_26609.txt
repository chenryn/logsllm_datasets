User:  Please list some common database optimization methods.
Assistant: 1. Index optimization: build indexes for columns that require frequent queries, and optimize the index structure. 2. Query optimization: Avoid using SELECT *, optimize SQL query statements, avoid using subqueries, refactor queries, etc. 3. Cache optimization: Use physical memory, cache mechanism, etc. to improve cache efficiency and avoid frequent database requests. 4. Database design optimization: rationally design the table structure, avoid database redundancy, normalize the table structure, etc. 5. Distributed optimization: use technologies such as distributed databases, partitions, and sub-tables to improve database performance. 6. Read-write separation optimization: use technologies such as master-slave replication and database mirroring to separate read requests and write requests to reduce database pressure. 7. Server optimization: Adjust operating system, database configuration parameters, etc. to improve server performance. 8. Application optimization: optimize the database access code in the application to avoid frequent access to the database, etc.
