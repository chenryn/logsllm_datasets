User: Recently I installed wxPython to do some works under Windows. Most of the time I work in Linux so I have a little experience here. 
with python.exe interpreter, I just do 2 line of codeimport wxtmp=wx.App(False)
Then the interpreter crashed with Windows error reporting.
I tried both python 2.7.1 and 2.6.6  with wxPython 2.8.11, all come from their main website, still no luck.
Is there something I must do after install Python in Windows ? I can see that python install just fine and can do some basic job, wxPython library can be load, but can't call wx.App
Assistant: In case like me somebody will stumble into this question like I did. Recently installed wxpython on two machines, windows 7 and XP. Testing the sample code in simple.py (provided with the wxpython docs-demos installer), running from a python console, I had the following problem on both machines: First import ok, but when I did a reload of the module, python crash.
I added this line in the end of the simple.py file: del app
and that fixed the problem on windows 7 and tomorrow I try it on the XP machine.
Same solution fitted for the XP machine. So, reloading an un-edited module with a reference to a wx.App with a closed gui seem not to be feasable. Killing the reference with a del statement was enough to solve the problem.
