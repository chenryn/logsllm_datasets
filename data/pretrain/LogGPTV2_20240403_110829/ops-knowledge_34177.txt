User: I'm trying to handle remote logging with app engine, but I find just by myself I'm exceeding the daily write limit. Are there any datastore tricks I can use to consume less of my write quota while posting data to the server constantly?
Assistant: Pack more data into an entity, and arrange to not index any fields you're never going to query on. That may interfere with querying your logs, but if writes predominate, pack more into each write, saving writes and index updates. You'll pay for it later when querying, but if queries are infrequent, it may be a net win.
