performance or higher security. We use the above tuning
method to bias neighbor selection during the expander graph
construction. SBIAS is the parameter used to vary the shap-
ing bias of the topology. As the value of SBIAS increases,
the resulting graph is more highly shaped, less random, and
contains greater number of high performance links. In ad-
dition to shaping the graph topology, we use the above tun-
ing function to pick nodes in the anonymity network. This
is called routing bias and RBIAS is the parameter used to
vary the amount of routing bias. We measure the perfor-
mance and security of fully connected, random expanders
and shaped expanders for varying values of SBIAS. We also
compare the performance of the above topologies when users
bias their selection of nodes using varying values of RBIAS.
We use the entropy metric described in [5] to measure the
security of the network topology. We measure the perfor-
mance in terms of the round-trip time taken for the messages
to travel from the entry node to the exit node. We model
the attacker as a global passive adversary who can observe
all links entering and exiting the mix network. The attacker
can also observe the links between mix nodes. The goal of
the attacker is to link incoming and outgoing streams.
3. SIMULATION AND RESULTS
We tested our hypothesis using simulation of a mix net-
work. We used the distributed method of expander construc-
tion described in [8] to generate the mix network topology.
Further, we used the KING dataset [2] for simulating the
round trip time (RTT) between nodes in the network. In
our ﬁrst simulation we measured the minimum degree at
which maximum entropy can be reached for an n-hop path.
In ﬁgure 1(a) we compare the minimum graph degree to
reach maximum entropy for a 3-hop and 4-hop path. We
measure the minimum degree for increasing number of to-
tal nodes in the network from N = 100 to 1700. We found
that for a 3-hop path, as the number of total nodes increases
the minimum degree reduces from N/2 for N = 100 total
nodes to about N/4 for N = 1700 nodes. If a 4-hop path
is used, the minimum degree even when N = 1700 is below
100 nodes.
In our next simulation we measured the entropy for paths
of diﬀerent hop lengths for a N = 500 nodes. The results are
shown in ﬁgure 1(b). We varied the graph degree from D = 5

to 100 and measured the entropy value for paths of diﬀerent
hop lengths. We found that a 3-hop path reaches close to
maximum entropy for D = 50. A 4-hop path reaches maxi-
mum entropy for only D = 25. Figure 1(c) shows the mini-
mum number of hops the path must have to reach maximum
entropy. We compared fully connected topology with ran-
dom expander and shaped expander topologies constructed
using SBIAS = 3, 9, and 15. We found that biasing the
expander construction does not lead to a topology that re-
quires signiﬁcantly more hops to reach maximum entropy.
This is an important result because it allows us to move to-
wards higher performance topologies without compromising
the security properties of the anonymity network.
Next, we measured the median link RTT of a shaped ex-
pander with N = 100 nodes with degree D = 20. We varied
the shaping bias of the expander from SBIAS = −15 to
15. Figure 1(d) plots the median link RTT against varying
SBIAS. We found that the median link RTT falls from 90
ms to 40 ms as the shaping bias increases. Figure 1(e) shows
the same result for a graph with N = 500 and D = 20. We
varied the shaping bias from SBIAS = 0 to 15. We found
that the median link RTT reduces from 55 ms to 36 ms
as SBIAS increases from 0 to 9. After SBIAS = 9 the
distributed construction methodology we used in our simu-
lation repeatedly selects the same links. Hence, we do not
see a continued improvement in link RTT as biasing contin-
ues to increase after SBIAS = 9. We then measured the
median path RTT for a 3-hop path for diﬀerent shaped ex-
pander graphs constructed using varying biasing values. The
biasing values used were SBIAS = 0, 1, 3, and 9. We also
varied the routing bias from RBIAS = 0 to RBIAS = 15.
We found that the expander topology with highest bias,
SBIAS = 9 gave the best performance. Increasing the bias
after SBIAS = 9 did not signiﬁcantly improve performance.
4. CONCLUSION
We explored ways to improve the security and perfor-
mance of anonymity networks using sparse topologies and
link-based performance metrics.
In particular, we studied
the use of expander graphs as a sparse topology. We found
that expanders show excellent promise and can be easily
adapted to improve link performance without substantial
loss of anonymity.
