### Performance and Security in Anonymity Networks

#### Tuning Methods for Expander Graph Construction
To enhance performance or security, we employ a tuning method to influence neighbor selection during the expander graph construction. The parameter `SBIAS` is used to adjust the shaping bias of the topology. As `SBIAS` increases, the resulting graph becomes more structured, less random, and contains a higher number of high-performance links. Additionally, this tuning function is used to select nodes in the anonymity network, known as routing bias, which is controlled by the `RBIAS` parameter.

We evaluate the performance and security of fully connected, random expanders, and shaped expanders for various values of `SBIAS`. We also compare the performance of these topologies when users bias their node selection using different `RBIAS` values. Network security is measured using the entropy metric described in [5], while performance is assessed based on the round-trip time (RTT) for messages traveling from the entry node to the exit node. Our attacker model assumes a global passive adversary who can observe all links entering and exiting the mix network, as well as the links between mix nodes, with the goal of linking incoming and outgoing streams.

### Simulation and Results

#### Simulation Setup
We tested our hypothesis using simulations of a mix network. The distributed method of expander construction described in [8] was used to generate the network topology. The KING dataset [2] was utilized to simulate RTTs between nodes.

#### Minimum Degree for Maximum Entropy
In the first simulation, we determined the minimum degree required to achieve maximum entropy for an n-hop path. Figure 1(a) compares the minimum graph degree needed to reach maximum entropy for 3-hop and 4-hop paths. We measured the minimum degree for increasing numbers of total nodes, from N = 100 to 1700. For a 3-hop path, the minimum degree decreases from N/2 for N = 100 nodes to about N/4 for N = 1700 nodes. For a 4-hop path, even with N = 1700, the minimum degree remains below 100 nodes.

#### Entropy for Different Hop Lengths
Next, we measured the entropy for paths of different hop lengths with N = 500 nodes. The results are shown in Figure 1(b). We varied the graph degree from D = 5 to 100 and found that a 3-hop path reaches near-maximum entropy at D = 50, while a 4-hop path achieves maximum entropy at D = 25. Figure 1(c) shows the minimum number of hops required to reach maximum entropy. We compared fully connected, random expander, and shaped expander topologies constructed with `SBIAS` values of 3, 9, and 15. We found that biasing the expander construction does not significantly increase the number of hops needed to reach maximum entropy, allowing us to move towards higher performance topologies without compromising security.

#### Median Link RTT
We then measured the median link RTT for a shaped expander with N = 100 nodes and degree D = 20, varying the shaping bias from `SBIAS` = -15 to 15. Figure 1(d) plots the median link RTT against `SBIAS`, showing a decrease from 90 ms to 40 ms as the shaping bias increases. Figure 1(e) presents similar results for a graph with N = 500 and D = 20, with `SBIAS` ranging from 0 to 15. The median link RTT reduces from 55 ms to 36 ms as `SBIAS` increases from 0 to 9. Beyond `SBIAS` = 9, the distributed construction methodology repeatedly selects the same links, leading to no further improvement in RTT.

#### Median Path RTT
Finally, we measured the median path RTT for a 3-hop path in different shaped expander graphs, using `SBIAS` values of 0, 1, 3, and 9. We also varied the routing bias from `RBIAS` = 0 to 15. The expander topology with the highest bias (`SBIAS` = 9) provided the best performance, and increasing the bias beyond `SBIAS` = 9 did not significantly improve performance.

### Conclusion
We explored methods to enhance the security and performance of anonymity networks using sparse topologies and link-based performance metrics. Specifically, we studied the use of expander graphs as a sparse topology. Our findings indicate that expanders show excellent promise and can be easily adapted to improve link performance without substantial loss of anonymity.
