**Title: Botconf 2017 - Automation Attacks at Scale**

Automation attacks are currently a significant threat to organizations across various industries, including finance, retail, and gaming & entertainment. These attacks leverage stolen credentials, black market and custom attack toolkits, and highly scalable infrastructure to execute widely distributed and extremely difficult-to-detect attacks. In this presentation, we will:

1. Provide an overview of the scale and impact of these automation attacks.
2. Discuss a detection methodology designed to counter such threats.
3. Present three real-world case studies that illustrate how attackers create and monetize the distributed infrastructure required for these large-scale attacks.

By the end of the session, attendees will have a deeper understanding of the nature of automation attacks and practical strategies to detect and mitigate them.
