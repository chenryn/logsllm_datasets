title:botconf2017 Automation Attacks at Scale
Automation attacks are currently plaguing organizations in industries ranging from financial to retail, to gaming & entertainment. These attacks exploit stolen credential leaks, black market & custom attack toolkits, and massively scalable infrastructure to launch widely distributed attacks that are extremely difficult to detect, let alone attribute. In this presentation we will inform the audience of the scale of this problem, discuss a detection methodology to counter these attacks, and walk through 3 real-world examples of how attackers created and monetized the distributed infrastructure they require to launch these attacks.
