I am trying to connect to a Google Cloud SQL instance, which is hosted in one Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project, from an App Engine application in another GCP project. However, I'm encountering an issue where the connection fails with the following error message:

```
OperationalError: (2013, "Lost connection to MySQL server at 'reading initial communication packet', system error: 38")
```

To resolve this, I followed the official Google documentation and added the App Engine service account of the second project to the IAM permissions list for the project hosting the Cloud SQL instance. I assigned the "Cloud SQL Editor" role to this service account. The connection details and configuration used in my application are identical to those in a fully functional App Engine app that is located in the same project as the Cloud SQL instance.

However, I noticed something unusual: In the second GCP project, the App Engine service account, which appears to be the default one ([MY-PROJECT-NAME]@appspot.gserviceaccount.com), is listed in the IAM permissions but not under the Service Accounts tab in the IAM & Admin section. The only service account listed there is the Compute Engine default service account. I have not deleted any service accounts, and no App Engine default service account has ever been listed here. Despite this, the App Engine application runs fine except for the MySQL connection issue.

For context, I am running a Python 2.7 application on the App Engine Standard Environment, using the `MySQLdb` library to connect to the database.

**Solution:**

After some investigation, I discovered the root cause of the problem. The "Cloud SQL Editor" role does not include all the necessary permissions for basic connectivity to the database; it primarily allows administrative tasks on the Cloud SQL instance. To fix the issue, I removed the IAM entry granting the "Cloud SQL Editor" role and replaced it with one that grants the "Cloud SQL Client" role. This change resolved the connection problem, and the database connection now works as expected.
