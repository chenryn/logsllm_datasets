The second argument is the command that will be run by crond. The third argument is the number of times the command should be run.The cron daemon is configured by the /etc/crontab file.

The second line specifies that the cron daemon should run at the default time of 0 0 * *. This means that the cron daemon will run every time the cron daemon is started.The last line specifies the cron daemon to run at the default time.You can also specify other fields in the crontab entry to configure other options for the cron daemon.The cron daemon is run by the cron daemon, which is the daemon that runs the cron jobs.
