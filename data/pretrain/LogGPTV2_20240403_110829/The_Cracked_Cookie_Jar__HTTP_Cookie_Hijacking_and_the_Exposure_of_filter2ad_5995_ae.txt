users are protected against our presented cookie hijacking
attacks. Speciﬁcally, we explore how users employing the
Tor bundle (Tor Browser with pre-installed extensions) can
be deanonymized by adversaries. In this case, we consider a
variation of the threat model from the previous sections; the
adversary monitors Tor exit nodes instead of public wireless
access points. We do not consider content-injection or active
attacks, such as SSL stripping [10] for weakening protection.
A. Experimental Analysis
We repeat our experiments from Section III on a subset of
the audited websites. To understand the protection that privacy-
conscious users can obtain, we experiment with three different
client-side setups. In the ﬁrst case, we simulate a user that uses
Firefox and connects over the Tor network [50] for increased
protection. The second user is more well-informed and has
installed the HTTPS Everywhere browser extension for better
protection. The ﬁnal case is of a user that has selected the
default conﬁguration of the Tor bundle, which includes the Tor
Browser (a modiﬁed Firefox) and other extensions (including
HTTPS Everywhere).
HTTPS Everywhere. This browser extension [51] is the
result of collaboration between EFF and the Tor Project. The
extension contains per domain rule-sets for a large number of
domains4, which instruct the re-writing of links within pages to
force encrypted connections. However, websites may contain
pages or subdomains whose functionality breaks over HTTPS.
For those cases, each website’s rule-set will contain exceptions
for identifying links pointing to problematic pages, which are
not overwritten and are connected to over HTTP. The rule-
sets are created and maintained by the community, which
requires a signiﬁcant amount of manual effort, and can result in
incomplete rules. Certain sites (e.g. doubleclick.net, ebay.com)
are turned off by default, as their functionality breaks if turned

on. Therefore, user accounts are likely to be exposed even with
this extension in place, since a single HTTP request is enough.
Table VII contains the results of our experiments. In the
ﬁrst case where the user browses through Firefox and only
employs Tor, the user remains vulnerable to the full extent of
the attacks described in Section III (denoted by ) . This is
expected as Tor is not designed to prevent this class of attacks.
In the second and third cases where HTTPS Everywhere is also
installed, we discover a varying degree of effectiveness.
For Google the attack surface is signiﬁcantly reduced,
as users visiting the main domain through the address bar
are protected. As this is a common usage scenario (if not
the most common), a signiﬁcant number of users may be
protected in practice. However, the extension’s rule-set does
not cover several cases, such as when the user visits one of
Google’s services through the address bar (e.g., by typing
google.com/maps), or when receiving Google’s Error
404 page. For Bing the attack surface is also signiﬁcantly
reduced, but users can still be exposed, e.g., by a subdomain
that hosts the search engine but does not work over HTTPS.
For cases such as Amazon and Yahoo, the protection offered
by the extension is ineffective against our attacks, as browsing
the website will expose the required cookies. In Amazon
any product page will reveal the required cookie, while in
Yahoo we always receive the cookies required from the links
on the homepage redirecting through hsrd.yahoo.com.

While for Ebay our attacks remain effective when we use
Firefox, we could not complete the experiment with the Tor
browser as any login attempts simply redirect to the login page
without any error message (probably due to incompatibility
with an extension). For the cases where the attack is still
feasible, Table VII does not present an exhaustive list of
vulnerable points, but an indicative selection of those we have
experimented with. In practice, any URL that is handled by
the exceptions in each website’s rule-set can potentially expose
the HTTP cookies.
Quantifying impact. To simulate the potential impact of
HTTPS Everywhere, we use the network trace collected from
our campus’ public WiFi, and calculate the number of accounts
that would remain exposed due to URLs not handled by
HTTPS Everywhere rule-sets (version 5.1.0). We found that
over 77.57% of all the collected HTTP trafﬁc would remain
over HTTP even if HTTPS Everywhere was installed in every
users’ browser. Due to those connections, 207,271 accounts
remain exposed to our cookie hijacking attacks. Table VIII
breaks down the numbers per targeted service. The largest im-
pact is seen in Youtube where less than 1% of the users remain
exposed while Ebay, Doubleclick and numerous news sites are
not impacted at all. Surprisingly, even though Google’s main
page is protected, over 46% of the users remain exposed when
visiting a Google service. For the remaining search engines,
the impact has a varying degree, with over 95% of the Baidu
users remaining susceptible to cookie hijacking.
While the Tor bundle offers signiﬁcant protection against
its effectiveness in mitigating cookie
a variety of attacks,
hijacking attacks varies greatly depending on each website’s
implementation. Even with all protection mechanisms enabled,
users still face the risk of deanonymization when visiting
popular sites. Therefore, the threat they face greatly depends
on their browsing behavior, which we try to evaluate next.
B. Evaluating Potential Risk
We want to explore whether privacy-conscious users actu-
ally visit these major websites over the Tor network, or if they
avoid them due to the lack of ubiquitous encryption.
Ethics. Again, we obtained IRB approval for our ex-
periments. However, due to our ethical considerations for
the Tor users (as they are not members of our university
nor connecting to our public wireless network), we do not
replicate the data collection we followed in our experiment

look at
the name of the cookies sent
from Section II-C. We opt for a coarse-grained non-invasive
measurement and only count the total connections towards the
websites we audited in Section III, using the port number to
differentiate between HTTP and HTTPS. We do not log other
information, inspect any part of the content, or attempt to
deanonymize any users. Furthermore, all data was deleted
after calculating the number of connections. Since we do
not
in the HTTP
connections, we cannot accurately estimate the number of
users that are susceptible to cookie hijacking attacks. Our
goal is to obtain a rough approximation of the number and
respective ratio of encrypted and unencrypted connections to
these popular websites. Based on the measurements from our
university’s wireless trace, we can deduce the potential extent
of the deanonymization risk that Tor users face. We consider
this an acceptable risk-beneﬁt tradeoff, as the bulk statistics
we collect do not endanger users in any way, and we can
inform the Tor community of a potentially signiﬁcant threat
they might already be facing. This will allow them to seek
countermeasures for protecting their users.
Tor exit node. The number of outgoing connections were
measured over 1 month, on a fresh exit node with a default
reduced exit policy5 and bandwidth limited to 300 KB/s.
Measurements. Figure 5 presents the number of total
connections and broken down for some services. The number
of connections over HTTP account for 75.4% of all
the
connections we saw, with an average of 10,152 HTTP and
3,300 HTTPS connections per hour. While non-HTTP trafﬁc
may be contained within the total connections, we do not dis-
tinguish it as that would require a more invasive approach. For
most of the services, the unencrypted connections completely
dominate the outgoing trafﬁc to the respective domains. On the
other hand, for Google we observe an average of 508 HTTP
connections per hour as opposed to 705 HTTPS connections.
Similarly we logged 23 unencrypted connections to Yahoo per
hour and 36 encrypted connections. We do not consider the
