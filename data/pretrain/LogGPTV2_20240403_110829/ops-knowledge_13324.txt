User: Please describe container technology, how is it different from virtual machines?
Assistant: Container technology is a virtualization technology that can create multiple independent operating environments at the operating system level, so that applications and their dependencies can run independently in these environments without affecting each other. Unlike virtual machines, container technology does not need to allocate a complete set of operating systems to each container, but instead shares a single operating system and creates multiple independent user spaces on it. This means higher utilization of operating system resources between containerized applications. Therefore, container technology is generally considered to be more lightweight, easier to deploy, and more scalable. At the same time, due to the close relationship between the application program in the container and the external system, the container technology can make the deployment, management and migration of the application program more convenient and efficient. Generally speaking, container technology is more lightweight, flexible and portable than virtual machines, and is suitable for the deployment and management of distributed applications. Virtual machines are more suitable for scenarios that require complete environmental isolation, such as security-critical applications and multi-tenant environments.
