1 Introduction
RFC 792 requires most ICMP error messages to quote the IP header and the
next eight bytes of the packet to which the ICMP error message applies. The
quoted packet is used by the receiver to match the ICMP message to an ap-
propriate process. An operating system may examine the quoted source and
destination IP addresses, IP protocol, and source and destination port numbers
to determine the socket or process corresponding to the ICMP message. In an
idealised end-to-end Internet, the portion of the packet quoted should be the
same as that which was sent, except for the IP TTL, DSCP, ECN bits, and
checksum ﬁelds. In the modern Internet, this may not always be the case. This
paper presents an analysis of ICMP quotations where the quote does not match
the probe.
2 Methodology
2.1 Data Collection
Using tcptraceroute, the paths to 84393 web servers used in a previous study [1]
were traced serially between the 6th and 12th of May 2005. All TCP SYN packets
sent from the measurement source, as well as all ICMP time exceeded, unreach-
able, source quench, redirect, and parameter problem messages were recorded
using tcpdump. 1190351 probes were sent, and 858090 ICMP replies were re-
ceived and matched to a probe from 53768 unique IP addresses. 836456 ICMP
responses were of type time exceeded, 21525 were of type unreachable, and 109
were of type source quench. A further 9 ICMP messages were unmatched.
By default, tcptraceroute generates a TCP SYN packet to port 80 and as-
signs the packet a unique IP-ID so that any subsequent response can be matched
to its probe. The ECE and CWR TCP ﬂags were set to test the reaction of mid-
dleboxes to these ﬂags. The DSCP/ECN IP ﬁelds were set to 0x0f to identify
systems that might modify these ﬁelds as part of the forwarding process. The
DF bit was set to identify behaviour related to workarounds for broken path
MTU discovery. Finally, each hop was probed once, to a maximum of 25 hops.

2.2 Quote Matching
As we may be matching an ICMP response to a packet that has been modiﬁed
in ﬂight, we are relatively liberal when matching an ICMP response to a probe.
Based on the responses seen, the following heuristic was devised. A list of the 25
most recently sent probes is kept, as well as an array of the most recently sent
probes for each IP-ID value. If an ICMP response can be matched by IP-ID or
byte-swapped IP-ID to one of the 25 most recently sent probes, then it is deemed
a match. Otherwise, it is not clear if any of these 25 probes match the ICMP
response, because it is possible that either the IP-ID in the quoted packet was
modiﬁed or the response was signiﬁcantly delayed.
We score each of these 25 probes, as well as the last probes sent with a match-
ing IP-ID or a byte-swapped IP-ID, and select the probe that meets the greatest
number of the following criteria: matching destination IP address, matching TCP
source port, matching TCP sequence number, no previous matching response, in
last 1200 sent. Providing at least one of the IP-ID, destination IP address, TCP
source port, or TCP sequence number matches, the probe with the largest num-
ber of matching criteria is the matching probe. To validate this technique, more
unusual matches were inspected manually, and they appeared to be genuine.
2.3 Modiﬁcation Classiﬁcation
A modiﬁcation may be classiﬁed one of three ways. First, if a modiﬁcation is
made to a single ﬁeld and it appears unrelated to any other modiﬁcation made,
then it is noted as only aﬀecting that ﬁeld; the modiﬁcation is further examined
to determine if the ﬁeld was set to zero, byte-swapped, incremented, or altered
in some other way. Second, if a modiﬁcation alters a set of ﬁelds in a related
way, the modiﬁcations are summarised. For example, if an intermediate node
inserts a TCP MSS option into a SYN packet as it is forwarded, then to do so
correctly it will adjust the IP length ﬁeld, TCP oﬀset, TCP checksum, as well
as include the option itself. Third, if a modiﬁcation appears to be the result of
accidentally overwriting a series of consecutive ﬁelds in the quoted packet, such
that the integrity of the quoted packet is now compromised, the modiﬁcation is
classed as clobbering the ﬁelds.
2.4 Spacial Classiﬁcation
Where possible, we infer if the modiﬁcation is made in-ﬂight while forwarding
the probe, or is made during the quoting process and therefore localised. Quotes
from a pair of adjacent hops are required to spacially classify a modiﬁcation. A
modiﬁcation is associated with the ﬁrst IP address of the pair. If a modiﬁcation
is observed at one hop but not the next, it is classed as a quoter modiﬁcation.
If the same modiﬁcation is observed at adjacent hops, it is classed as an in-
ﬂight modiﬁcation provided at least one of the corresponding IP or TCP check-
sums quoted is valid, indicating the change was intentional. This reduces the
chance that adjacent quoter modiﬁcations are incorrectly classiﬁed as an in-ﬂight

modiﬁcation, perhaps due to using the same router model with the same quirk at
adjacent hops. Otherwise, if a modiﬁcation is observed, but there is not a quote
from an adjacent hop available for spacial classiﬁcation, then it is classiﬁed as
an edge modiﬁcation. Finally, we stop processing a path when a loop is inferred.
3 Results
3.1 Observed Quote Lengths
Most quoters observed (87.60%) quote the ﬁrst 28 bytes of the probe, which is
the minimum amount permitted. 8.60% quote 40 bytes, corresponding to the size
of the probe sent, and 2.14% quote 140 bytes, corresponding to ICMP quotations
with MPLS extensions included. Therefore, at least 10.7% of quoters allow the
complete IP and TCP headers of a probe to be compared with its quote.
3.2 Modiﬁcations to IPv4 Headers
The most frequent in-ﬂight modiﬁcation observed is to the DSCP/ECN byte:
2.9% of quoters were observed to modify this byte. 31 were inferred to use
inconsistent values when overwriting the byte. This could be a measurement
artifact due to attributing the change to the ﬁrst IP address where it was ob-
served, rather than an IP address of the previous hop where the change may
have been made. 1073 quoters were observed to clear the DSCP, but leave the
ECN bits intact, while 429 quoters were observed to clear the complete byte.
71 were observed to assign a DSCP of ‘001000’, indicating some networks may
prioritise HTTP traﬃc using the IP precedence bits. The second-most frequent
in-ﬂight modiﬁcation observed was a modiﬁcation of the destination IP address;
of the 29 quoters that made modiﬁcations, 16 used RFC 1918 private addresses.
Finally, 4 quoters were observed to clear the DF bit of an in-ﬂight packet.

The quoter modiﬁcations observed on the IPv4 header indicate artifacts of
processing the packet. The most frequent quoter modiﬁcation observed is to the
IP length ﬁeld; of the 174 modiﬁcations, 160 were to change the ﬁeld from having
a value of 40 (0x28) to a value of 60 (0x3c), while the remaining 14 changed it
to a value of 0x2814. Both modiﬁcations suggest the length of the IP header was
added during processing; in the second case, the ﬁeld was byte-swapped ﬁrst.
3.3 Modiﬁcations to TCP Headers
Table 1 shows that most modiﬁcations to the TCP header were not identiﬁed as
quoter or in-ﬂight modiﬁcations; therefore, we examine all unique modiﬁcations.
46 quoters modiﬁed the TCP source port; 10 of these quoters used port 1, while
the rest chose values that were only seen once. 132 quoters modiﬁed the TCP
destination port. Some values were observed from multiple quoters and show
signs of port redirection; for example, port 81 was seen from 11 quoters, and
port 8080 from 13 quoters. Other port values chosen were seen once or twice.
23 quoters revealed that an MSS option was added in-line to the TCP header,
probably to work around paths with broken path MTU discovery. 15 quoters
revealed an MSS of 536 bytes had been set, 5 an MSS of 1460, and a series of
quoters revealed cases of 1360, 1414, and 1436.
3.4 Quote Clobbering
Some probe modiﬁcations (not listed in Table 1) are due to inadvertent clob-
bering or modiﬁcation of the quote in the quoting process. We group these
modiﬁcations into four categories. 71 quoters (0.1%) quoted the ﬁrst 28 bytes
of a probe correctly, but then clobbered more than half the remaining bytes in
the quote. 203 quoters (0.4%) quoted 60 bytes in the response; as the probe was
only 40 bytes in size, the remaining 20 bytes were from a previous user of the
memory, as described in US CERT note VU#471084. An additional 4 quoters
over-quoted by 10 bytes, although at least the ﬁrst six extra bytes were zero.
Finally, 14 quoters over-quoted by 8 bytes, and set the last 16 bytes to zero.
3.5 Observed RTTs
Some probe packets required a long wait for an ICMP response. 56 required
arrived over 10 seconds after the probe was sent, 34 more than 100 seconds, and
30 more than 300 seconds. The reason for these long round trips is not obvious;
perhaps the probe is triggering link establishment and the probe is forwarded
when the link is complete.

servers. Many in-ﬂight changes are able to be attributed to known packet rewrit-
ing techniques. In the data collected for this paper, relatively few quoters are
inferred to modify packets in-ﬂight, or indeed to modify them during processing.
