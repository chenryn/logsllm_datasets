User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How can I find out what AD groups I'm a member of? I'm running a Windows XP desktop in a corporate environment.  How can I find out what AD groups I belong to?

Assistant: Try running gpresult /R for RSoP summary or gpresult /V for verbose output from the command line as an administrator on the computer. It should output something like this:

C:\Windows\system32&gt;gpresult /V
