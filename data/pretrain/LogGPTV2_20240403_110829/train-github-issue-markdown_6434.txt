Hey!
While trying to fix egeloen/IvoryCKEditorBundle#212 I have added a
`form_javascript` Twig functions which allows to render form javascript
related code where you want in the template.
Doing so, allow to link javascript code to a specific form type, allow to
render your javascript where you want in the page (often at the bottom of the
page), allow to take benefit of the form theming inheritance (for example:
form -> text -> textarea) and also define a standard way of linking javascript
code to a form.
I have decided to open the issue because my implementation is not new, it has
been inspired by GenemuFormBundle and DatetimepickerBundle which both rely on
the exact same concept and the exact same code is duplicated along different
bundles...
Now my question is does it belong to the core or to a third party library?
WDYT?
