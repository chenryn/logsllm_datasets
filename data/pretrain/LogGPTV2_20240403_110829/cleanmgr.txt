### cleanmgr
**Applies to:** Windows Server 2022, Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2008 R2

**Description:**
The `cleanmgr` command-line utility is used to clear unnecessary files from your computer's hard disk. You can specify which types of files to clean up, such as temporary files, Internet files, downloaded files, and Recycle Bin files. Additionally, you can schedule the cleanup task to run at a specific time using the Scheduled Tasks tool.

### Syntax
```sh
cleanmgr [/d <drive>] [/sageset:n] [/sagerun:n] [/TUNEUP:n] [/LOWDISK] [/VERYLOWDISK] [/?]
```

### Parameters
- **/d <drive>**: Specifies the drive that you want Disk Cleanup to clean. Note: The `/d` option is not utilized with `/sagerun:n`.
- **/sageset:n**: Displays the Disk Cleanup Settings dialog box and creates a registry key to store the settings you select. The `n` value (an integer from 0 to 9999) allows you to specify tasks for Disk Cleanup to run.
- **/sagerun:n**: Runs the specified tasks assigned to the `n` value if you use the `/sageset` option. All drives on the computer are enumerated, and the selected profile runs against each drive.
- **/tuneup:n**: Runs both `/sageset` and `/sagerun` for the same `n` value.
- **/lowdisk**: Runs Disk Cleanup with the default settings.
- **/verylowdisk**: Runs Disk Cleanup with the default settings and no user prompts.
- **/?**: Displays help at the command prompt.

### Options
The following options can be specified for the files that Disk Cleanup will remove when using `/sageset` and `/sagerun`:

- **Temporary Setup Files**: Files created by a Setup program that is no longer running.
- **Downloaded Program Files**: ActiveX controls and Java programs automatically downloaded from the Internet. These files are temporarily stored in the `C:\Winnt\Downloaded Program Files` folder.
- **Temporary Internet Files**: Web pages stored on your hard disk for quick viewing. This option includes a "View Files" button to see the files before they are removed.
- **Old Chkdsk Files**: Lost file fragments saved by Chkdsk during disk error checks.
- **Recycle Bin**: Contains deleted files. This option includes a "View Files" button to open the Recycle Bin.
- **Temporary Files**: Information stored in a Temp folder by programs. Files not modified within the last week can be safely deleted.
- **Temporary Offline Files**: Local copies of recently used network files, cached for offline use.
- **Offline Files**: Local copies of network files that you specifically want to have available offline.
- **Compress Old Files**: Compresses files that have not been used recently to save disk space. No files are deleted.
- **Catalog Files for the Content Indexer**: Indexing service files that speed up and improve file searches. These files can be safely deleted.

### Notes
- If you specify cleaning up the drive containing the Windows installation, all options are available on the Disk Cleanup tab.
- If you specify any other drive, only the Recycle Bin and Catalog files for content index options are available on the Disk Cleanup tab.

### Examples
- To run the Disk Cleanup app and specify options to save as set 1:
  ```sh
  cleanmgr /sageset:1
  ```
- To run Disk Cleanup with the options specified in set 1:
  ```sh
  cleanmgr /sagerun:1
  ```
- To run both `/sageset:1` and `/sagerun:1` together:
  ```sh
  cleanmgr /sageset:1
  cleanmgr /sagerun:1
  ```
  or
  ```sh
  cleanmgr /tuneup:1
  ```

This optimized version provides a clearer and more organized structure, making it easier to understand and follow.
