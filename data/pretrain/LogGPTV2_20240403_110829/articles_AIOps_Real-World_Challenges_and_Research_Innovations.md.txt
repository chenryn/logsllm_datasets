### Abstract
AIOps leverages artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques to empower software and service engineers, including developers, program managers, support engineers, and site reliability engineers, to efficiently and effectively build and operate large-scale online services and applications. AIOps can enhance service quality, customer satisfaction, engineering productivity, and reduce operational costs. In this technical briefing, we first summarize the real-world challenges in building AIOps solutions based on our experience at Microsoft. We then propose a roadmap for AIOps-related research directions and share successful AIOps solutions we have developed for Microsoft service products.

**Keywords:** AIOps, DevOps, Software Analytics

### I. Why AIOps?
The software industry has transitioned from delivering boxed products to releasing services, including online services and applications. This shift necessitates a different approach to building and releasing services, emphasizing operational efficacy. DevOps, a methodology for continuous development and release, has been widely adopted. However, the increasing scale and complexity of services, driven by cloud computing, pose significant challenges to software and service engineers. AIOps, a term coined by Gartner, addresses these challenges by integrating AI and ML into DevOps practices.

### II. Our Vision of AIOps
We envision that AIOps will achieve the following three goals:
1. **High Service Intelligence:** An AIOps-powered service will have timely awareness of changes, such as quality degradation, cost increases, and workload spikes. It can also predict future status based on historical behaviors, workload patterns, and underlying infrastructure changes.
2. **High Customer Satisfaction:** A service with built-in intelligence can understand customer usage behavior and proactively take actions to improve satisfaction. For example, it can recommend tuning suggestions to customers to optimize performance or proactively engage with customers experiencing issues.
3. **High Engineering Productivity:** Engineers and operators will be relieved of tedious tasks like manually collecting information and fixing repeated issues. AI/ML techniques will enable them to learn system behavior patterns, predict future service and customer activities, and make necessary architecture and adaptation changes.

### III. Real-World Challenges
The software industry is still in the early stages of innovating and adopting AIOps solutions. While the importance of AIOps is increasingly recognized, building and implementing AIOps solutions in real-world settings remains challenging. Based on our experience at Microsoft, we identify the following major challenges:

#### A. Gaps in Innovation Methodologies and Mindset
- **Innovation Methodologies:** There is a lack of holistic methodologies to guide the development of AIOps solutions, which require a deep understanding of business value, data, models, and system integration.
- **Mindset Shift:** The traditional engineering mindset, which focuses on individual cases, is inefficient in large-scale service scenarios. AIOps requires a mindset shift towards learning from history and identifying patterns from large amounts of data.

#### B. Engineering Changes Needed to Support AIOps
- **Engineering Best Practices:** Traditional best practices do not fit the needs of AIOps. Significant engineering efforts are required, and AIOps-oriented engineering principles, such as data/label quality monitoring and continuous model validation, need to be established.
- **Data Quality and Quantity:** Although major cloud services collect vast amounts of telemetry data, there is a lack of representative and high-quality data for building AIOps solutions. Continuous improvement in data quality and quantity is necessary.

#### C. Difficulty in Building ML Models for AIOps
- **Supervised Learning Challenges:** Obtaining high-quality ground truth labels for supervised learning is difficult due to imbalances, small amounts, and high noise levels.
- **Unsupervised and Semi-Supervised Learning:** In many AIOps scenarios, unsupervised or semi-supervised learning models are more feasible due to the difficulty of obtaining labeled data. For example, detecting anomalous service behavior often relies on unsupervised methods.

### IV. Research Innovations in AIOps
AIOps is a cross-disciplinary research area involving system design, software engineering, big data, AI, ML, distributed computing, and information visualization. Achieving our AIOps vision requires close collaboration between academia and industry. Some key research areas include:

#### A. Cross-Disciplinary Research
- **System Design and AI Integration:** System researchers need to work with ML experts to build services with self-awareness and auto-adaptation.
- **Software Analytics:** Many existing research works on software analytics can be viewed as AIOps innovations.

#### B. Close Collaboration Between Academia and Industry
- **Understanding Real-World Pain Points:** The real pain points of software and service engineers need to be well understood.
- **Researching Real-World Behaviors:** The running behaviors of real-world services need to be studied, and the proliferation of open-source software can facilitate this research.

### V. Outline of Technical Briefing

1. Discuss the motivation and emerging importance of AIOps.
2. Describe the real-world challenges of building AIOps solutions based on our experience at Microsoft.
3. Introduce a set of sample AIOps solutions that have benefited Microsoft service products.
