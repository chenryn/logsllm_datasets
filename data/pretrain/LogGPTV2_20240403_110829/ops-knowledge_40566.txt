User: Anyone know of any good ways to do puppet like pp files for python. Almost like config files that can inherit other configs files and also have limited logic in them like if statements and variables?
Thanks!
Assistant: Consider using Python, with in-house rules limiting what can appear in a config file.
The advantages are that no one has to learn another language, it's really, really cheap to implement, and you don't have to worry about maintenance of the config parser. The disadvantages are that it's not a custom-designed language for your particular use-case, and that if you're not strict in limiting what syntax may be used you'll end up with mushrooming complexity in your config files.
