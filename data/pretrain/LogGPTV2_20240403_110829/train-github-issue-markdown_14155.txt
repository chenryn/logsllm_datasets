The documentation says very little about the `priority` attribute:
    priority (int): The task priority, a number between 0 and 9.
      Defaults to the :attr:`priority` attribute.
If you go to the bottom of the following page -
http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/userguide/calling.html \- you will
see:
> priority  
>  A number between 0 and 255, where 255 is the highest priority.
>
> Supported by: RabbitMQ, Redis (priority reversed, 0 is highest).
So please clarify (and update the documentation):
  * Which of these documents are telling the right information - the (current) source code, or the docs.celeryproject.org ?
  * How are priorities ordered - does priority=0 mean highest priority, or not? Or it depends on the backend, as the docs page says...
