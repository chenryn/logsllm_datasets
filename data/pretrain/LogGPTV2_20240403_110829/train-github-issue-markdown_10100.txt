Subject: Issue with Shadow Mapping in Multiple Viewports Using Three.js

Hello,

I hope this message finds you well. I am currently encountering an issue while attempting to use shadows in a scene that is rendered into two separate viewports (based on the example provided at [this link](http://mrdoob.github.io/three.js/examples/webgl_multiple_views.html)).

When I enable shadowing, the shadow map, which is only used in one of the scenes and one viewport, becomes corrupted. Please refer to the attached image for a visual representation of the problem. In the screenshot, there is only one shadow receiver, and no objects are casting shadows. However, parts of the ground are incorrectly displayed as being in shadow.

Interestingly, when I disable `renderer.enableScissorTest(true)`, the shadows render correctly, but I lose the rendering in my other viewport.

Is there a possible workaround for this issue?

- **Library Version:** three.js r58
- **Operating System:** Windows 7
- **Browsers Tested:** Latest Google Chrome, Latest Firefox

Thank you for your time and any advice you can provide. I must also say that I find three.js to be a great library, and I appreciate all the hard work that goes into it.

Best regards,  
Boris Zapotocky
