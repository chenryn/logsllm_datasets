Hi!
I've run into issue when trying to use shadows in my scene that is rendered
into two separate viewports (separate scenes, based on
http://mrdoob.github.io/three.js/examples/webgl_multiple_views.html). The
moment I enable shadowing, shadow map (used only in one scene, one viewport)
is corrupted. Please see the image attached. There is only one shadow receiver
in the screenshot and no object casting shadows, yet, parts of the ground are
suggested as in shadow. When I remove renderer.enableScissorTest(true),
shadows are ok (but I lose my other viewport rendering of course).
Can this be done with some workaround?
three.js r58, win7, latest google chrome, latest firefox
Great library btw! Keep up the good work and thanks for any advice!  
Regards,
