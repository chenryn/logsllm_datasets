## Abstract

Shared credentials, such as passwords, are the most common form of end-user authentication due to their convenience. However, they are vulnerable to credential database theft and phishing attacks. Alternative mechanisms, such as cryptographic challenge-response protocols, offer strong authentication but require tamper-resistant hardware, which is cumbersome for users.

In this paper, we propose a strong authentication mechanism that does not rely on tamper-resistant hardware at the user end. Our scheme uses password-based credentials to generate designated-verifiable authentication tokens. This approach is resistant to offline dictionary attacks even if an attacker steals the password-protected credentials, making it suitable for implementation on general-purpose devices.

We introduce and formalize the concept of Password-Based Credentials (PBC), which ensures resistance to offline attacks and the unforgeability of authentication tokens, even if attackers can observe these tokens and capture password-protected credentials of honest users. We present a highly efficient construction of PBC using a "randomize-then-prove" approach and prove its security. This construction does not involve bilinear pairings and can be implemented with common cryptographic libraries across various platforms.

We also present a technique to transform the PBC scheme into a publicly-verifiable one and demonstrate its application in federated identity systems to provide holder-of-key assertion mechanisms. Compared to certificate-based approaches, our method is more convenient and user-friendly, and it can be used in federation systems that employ privacy-preserving measures, such as Sign-in with Apple.

Our implementation and performance evaluation show that PBC saves 26%-36% of time compared to ECDSA-based strong authentication with tamper-resistant hardware. In federated identity applications, PBC can save even more time when the user proves possession of the key to a Relying Party.

## 1. Introduction

Passwords, or shared credentials, have been the dominant form of authentication for decades, but they are also considered the weakest link in modern computer systems. Traditional shared-credential authentication mechanisms store user credentials in centralized repositories and transfer them explicitly, creating significant targets for attackers. These credentials can be stolen in bulk from breached repositories or captured during transmission (e.g., through phishing attacks).

To address the security risks associated with shared credentials, strong authentication techniques have been widely adopted by the industry and standardization communities. Strong authentication schemes use cryptographic challenge-response identification protocols, where one entity (the claimant) proves its identity to another entity (the verifier) by demonstrating knowledge of a secret associated with the claimant. During authentication, the secret is neither revealed to the verifier nor transferred over the channel. Such mechanisms can be built using symmetric-key or public-key cryptography.

For symmetric-key-based mechanisms, the two entities share a symmetric key, and the claimant verifies its identity by encrypting a challenge or generating a MAC value for the challenge. For public-key-based mechanisms, the claimant demonstrates knowledge of its private key by digitally signing a challenge or decrypting a challenge encrypted under its public key. Examples include the FIDO Alliance's Universal Authentication Framework (UAF) and the W3C's Web Authentication specification, both of which use public-key techniques for strong authentication.

However, conventional strong authentication mechanisms face the challenge of secure secret storage, whether it is a symmetric key or a private key. A common approach is to encrypt the secret with a password, but this protection is vulnerable to offline attacks if the attacker can steal the password-protected credential and capture the authentication token. The attacker can guess a password and determine its correctness offline, leading to successful attacks.

In practice, these secrets are often stored in tamper-resistant hardware modules at the user end. Both the FIDO UAF protocol and the W3C's specification recommend using tamper-resistant hardware (e.g., SIM cards and Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs)) to protect private keys and perform cryptographic operations. However, this decreases the usability of strong authentication schemes, as the module becomes another item to carry, and the secret keys are permanently lost if the module is broken or lost.

For federated identity systems, assertions convey authentication and attribute information from Identity Providers (IdPs) to Relying Parties (RPs). Bearer assertions can be presented directly to the RP or forwarded through the user, but they can lead to impersonation attacks if captured by attackers. To enhance security, the concept of holder-of-key assertions has been introduced, which prevents assertions from being abused and ensures non-repudiation. This technique is used in commercial products like Microsoft's XBOX and IBM's WebSphere and is a requirement for the highest level of federation assurance in NIST guidelines.

Currently, holder-of-key assertion mechanisms are mainly implemented via certificates, where the user must send an X.509 certificate and prove possession of the key. However, this is inconvenient for users and requires tamper-resistant hardware to protect private keys. Additionally, for federated identity systems that use RP-specific pseudonyms to protect user privacy (e.g., Sign-in with Apple), RPs can collude and link the same user through the key used in holder-of-key assertions, breaking the un-linkability provided by pseudonyms. With current technologies, an IdP cannot simultaneously preserve user privacy and support holder-of-key assertions.

### A. Our Contributions

The main contribution of this paper is the first strong authentication scheme that does not require tamper-resistant hardware to protect secrets at the user end. We also present its application in federated identity systems to address issues of user privacy and reliance on tamper-resistant hardware in current holder-of-key assertion mechanisms. Our scheme wraps user credentials with passwords and can be implemented on various devices (e.g., mobile phones and desktop computers) to support cross-terminal authentication, while being resistant to phishing and offline dictionary attacks.

Our contributions can be summarized as follows:

- **Formalization of Password-Based Credentials (PBC):** We define the syntax of a new primitive called PBC. A user with identifier `uid` registers with a server and obtains a credential `cre` wrapped (encrypted) with a password `pw`. The password-wrapped credential `[cre]pw` can be stored on a general-purpose device or in the cloud. For authentication, the user uses `pw` and `[cre]pw` to create an authentication token `σ` on a challenge message `m`. The server authenticates the user by checking if `σ` is valid for `m` with respect to `uid`.

- **Security Model:** We establish the necessary security requirement of Existential UnForgeability under Chosen Message and Chosen Verification queries Attacks (EUF-CMVA) for PBC. Our security model covers a wide range of practical threats, including adaptive corruption of users, obtaining password-wrapped credentials of honest users, and observing authentication tokens generated by honest users.

- **Efficient Construction of PBC:** We propose a highly efficient construction of PBC, denoted as `ΠPBC`, and prove its security under the cryptographic q-SDH and q-DDHI assumptions in the random oracle model. `ΠPBC` is resistant to offline attacks because authentication tokens generated by honest users can only be verified by a designated server. This construction does not rely on bilinear pairings and can be easily implemented with common cryptographic libraries on many platforms.

- **Public-Verifiability Transformation:** We present a technique to transform the designated-verifiability of `ΠPBC` into public-verifiability. Using this technique, we demonstrate an application of PBC in federated identity systems to implement holder-of-key assertion mechanisms, which can be integrated into standardized federation protocols like SAML2 and OpenID Connect. This approach enables a user to provide a key reference to the IdP and prove possession of the corresponding key to the RP using a PBC authenticator. It also provides an option to verify holder-of-key assertions while hiding the user's identity, useful in federation systems that employ privacy-preserving measures like Sign-in with Apple.

- **Performance Evaluation:** We evaluate the performance of our schemes over Local Area Networks (LAN) and Wide Area Networks (WAN) under different latencies and compare them with ECDSA-based strong authentication using tamper-resistant hardware. For strong authentication, PBC (denoted as AUTH-PBC) saves 26%-36% of time compared to ECDSA-based strong authentication. For its application as a holder-of-key assertion mechanism, PBC speeds up the process by 41%-55% compared to ECDSA-based approaches.

### B. Technical Overview

**Challenges and Techniques:**

- **Avoiding Offline Attacks:** The primary challenge of using passwords to protect credentials is avoiding offline dictionary attacks. The credential should not have any structural characteristics, as these can be exploited in offline attacks. Our solution addresses this challenge through two techniques:
  - **Indistinguishable Credentials:** The credentials in our scheme are indistinguishable from random group elements, making them resistant to offline attacks. We use password-based encryption proposed by [14] to wrap the credentials, ensuring that decryption with any password results in group elements with the same structure.
  - **Designated-Verifiable Tokens:** The authentication tokens are generated using a "randomize-then-prove" paradigm and can only be verified by a designated verifier with the corresponding secret key. This ensures that the tokens cannot be verified with the credential or by an attacker who does not know the secret key.
