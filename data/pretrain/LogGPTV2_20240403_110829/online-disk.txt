### Online Disk Command

**Function:**
The `online disk` command transitions an offline disk to an online state. For basic disks, this command attempts to bring the selected disk and all its volumes online. For dynamic disks, it attempts to bring online all non-foreign disks on the local computer, as well as all volumes on these dynamic disks.

**Behavior with Dynamic Disks:**
- If a dynamic disk in a disk group is brought online and it is the only disk in the group, the original group is recreated, and the disk is moved to that group.
- If there are other disks in the group and they are already online, the disk is simply added back into the group.
- If the group of the selected disk contains mirrored or RAID-5 volumes, the command will also resynchronize these volumes.

**Note:**
- A disk must be selected for the `online disk` command to succeed. Use the `select disk` command to select a disk and shift the focus to it.
- This command will fail if used on a read-only disk.

**Syntax:**
```plaintext
online disk [noerr]
```

**Parameters:**
- **noerr**: (For scripting only) When an error is encountered, DiskPart continues to process commands as if the error did not occur. Without this parameter, an error causes DiskPart to exit with an error code.

**Examples:**
To bring the currently focused disk online, type:
```plaintext
online disk
```
