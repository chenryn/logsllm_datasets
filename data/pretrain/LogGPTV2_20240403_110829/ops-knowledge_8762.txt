Question: An Android application is designed with the following permission in its manifest file:

xml
<permission name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" >
    <group gid="location" />
</permission>


Given the output of the `id` command for the application's process is shown below:

bash
uid=10234(u0_a234) gid=10234(u0_a234) groups=10234(u0_a234),3003(inet),10234(all_a234) context=u:r:untrusted_app:s0:c512,c768


Which of the following statements accurately describes the app's permissions with respect to accessing the device's fine location?
"A": "The app has the 'ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION' permission because it belongs to the 'location' group.",
"B": "The app does not have the 'ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION' permission because it does not belong to the 'location' group.",
"C": "The app has the 'ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION' permission by default since all apps have access to fine location unless explicitly denied.",
"D": "The app does not have the 'ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION' permission because it has the 'inet' group ID, which is unrelated to location permissions."
Answer: B
