Example:
https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/v3.1.3/src/Symfony/Component/Security/Core/Authentication/AuthenticationProviderManager.php#L33
Could be like:
    /**
     * @var AuthenticationProviderInterface[]
     */
    private $providers;
Or at least:
    /**
     * @var array
     */
    private $providers;
Adding PhpDocs would ease up reading the code, as one could just see the type
of data stored in a field, instead of reading all the class' code, to reason
what it contains. And of course, it would make IDE autocompletion better
supported.
I volunteer to add them and submit a PR.
