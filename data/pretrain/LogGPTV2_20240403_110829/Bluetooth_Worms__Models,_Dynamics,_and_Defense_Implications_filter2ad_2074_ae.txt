# Bluetooth Worm Propagation: Analysis and Optimization

## 1. Introduction
Recent occurrences of Bluetooth worms have raised significant security concerns regarding the data stored on mobile devices such as cell phones and PDAs. This paper investigates the nature and dynamics of Bluetooth worm propagation, focusing on how device mobility and channel congestion impact propagation speed. We also explore how advanced worms can enhance their propagation by strategically selecting parameters or leveraging additional long-distance communication capabilities.

## 2. Inquiry Timeout and Expected Number of Responses
The Bluetooth inquiry specification states that the inquiry timeout (Tinq) must be at least 10.24 seconds to discover all devices in an error-free environment. However, an "intelligent" worm may not adhere to this recommendation if it does not improve its propagation speed.

### 2.1 Effects of Changing Inquiry Parameters
- **Larger Tinq**: A larger inquiry timeout value allows the worm to potentially discover more nearby devices within one infection cycle. However, if there are insufficient responses, the inquiry process must wait until the timer expires.
- **Smaller Tinq**: A smaller timeout value can shorten the inquiry process, but the worm may receive fewer responses.
- **Ninq (Expected Number of Responses)**: A worm using a large Ninq can discover more devices, but if fewer than Ninq responses are received, the inquiry process waits for the timer to expire.

### 2.2 Experimental Results
In our experiments, we varied Tinq among 10.24, 7.68, 5.12, and 2.56 seconds and Ninq among 7, 5, 3, and 1. The results for static and mobile networks are illustrated in Figures 19 and 20, respectively.

- **Static Network**:
  - Varying Tinq does not significantly affect performance, except for the smallest value (2.56 seconds).
  - Expecting only one inquiry response is always suboptimal for shortening propagation time, regardless of Tinq.
  - The shortest propagation time (117.36 seconds) is achieved with Tinq = 5.12 seconds and Ninq = 3, which is 27.3% shorter than the baseline worm.

- **Mobile Network**:
  - If Ninq is 1 or 3, the propagation time for 95% infection coverage is relatively insensitive to Tinq.
  - Smaller Ninq values generally lead to shorter propagation times.
  - The optimal configuration (Ninq = 1, Tinq = 7.68 seconds) requires 189.22 seconds, which is about 60% of the time used by the baseline worm.

## 3. Tuning Inactive Duration
The baseline worm remains inactive for 20 seconds after each infection cycle (Tidle). To investigate the impact of varying Tidle, we performed experiments with Tidle set to 1, 10, 20, and 30 seconds.

- **Static Network**:
  - A very short Tidle (1 second) leads to severe co-channel interference, significantly slowing down worm propagation.
  - Increasing Tidle from 1 to 30 seconds decreases the time for 95% infection coverage, but this trend may not continue indefinitely.

- **Mobile Network**:
  - Varying Tidle has little impact on propagation speed.
  - A short Tidle does not cause the same interference issues as in the static network due to device mobility.

## 4. Exploiting Out-of-Band Propagation
Bluetooth interfaces often coexist with other communication channels (e.g., MMS, GPRS). A Bluetooth worm can exploit these out-of-band channels to accelerate its propagation.

### 4.1 MMS Communication
- **Assumptions**:
  - All devices have both Bluetooth and MMS capabilities.
  - MMS messages are coded using the GPRS 3+2 scheme.
  - Each device has a list of "buddies" to whom it frequently sends MMS messages.

- **Results**:
  - One buddy per device reduces propagation time by half in the static network.
  - In the mobile network, increasing the number of buddies from one to two further improves propagation speed (35.5% to 53% reduction).

## 5. Defense Implications
As Bluetooth worms become more sophisticated, defending against them through manual human intervention becomes increasingly difficult. Active defense schemes like patching counter-worms may not be effective due to power consumption and network congestion issues.

- **Software Diversity**: Increasing software diversity can slow down worm propagation by reducing the number of vulnerable devices.
- **Quarantine Defense**: Quarantining infected devices in specific areas can be effective, but out-of-band communication capabilities complicate this approach.

## 6. Related Work
- **Internet Worms**: Substantial research has been done on analyzing, modeling, and simulating Internet worms.
- **Mobile Networks**: Few studies have focused on worm propagation in mobile networks. Mickens et al. [15] observed that traditional epidemic models fail to characterize worm propagation in mobile networks. Our results, incorporating detailed MAC/PHY layer protocols, suggest that higher mobility can lead to more unsuccessful interactions between devices.

## 7. Summary
This paper investigates the propagation dynamics of Bluetooth worms, highlighting the impact of device mobility and channel congestion. We demonstrate that advanced worms can optimize their propagation by strategically selecting parameters and exploiting out-of-band communication. Effective defense strategies include increasing software diversity and implementing quarantine measures.
