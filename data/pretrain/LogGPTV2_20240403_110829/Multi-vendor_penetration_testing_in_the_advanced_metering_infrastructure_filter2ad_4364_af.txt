### AMI System and Communications
The Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) system at Tri-State Electric Membership Corporation utilizes power line carrier communications modules to relay data from smart meters through substations to the utility's back office monitoring systems. This decision was driven by the utility’s hilly geographical profile and low customer density, which made a wireless approach less financially viable. An upgraded Meter Data Management System (MDMS) provides a platform for validating, organizing, analyzing, and distributing meter data to other applications, including the billing system and the new customer web portal.

### Reduced Truck Rolls and Vehicle Miles
Following the deployment of 2,000 remote service switches on AMI meters, Tri-State avoided 13,000 truck rolls in the first two years, resulting in over 51,800 vehicle-miles not traveled.

### O&M Cost Savings and Improved Reliability
Tri-State realized a 65% decrease in annual meter operations costs, from approximately $450,000 per year in 2011 to about $156,000 per year in 2013. The SGIG AMI deployments began in 2010. Figure 12 provides a detailed cost breakdown. Smart meters allow Tri-State to reconnect service without customer notification, detect outages in subdivisions with many vacant second homes, and prevent potential property damage such as frozen pipes.

### Reduced Bad Debt through Pre-Pay Program
Tri-State’s voluntary pre-pay plan has been popular with some customers because no deposit is required, and there are no late fees. Deposits for traditional accounts range from $100 to $300, and late fees are typically 5% of the balance due after the due date. With pre-pay, customers can establish service for $75, including $50 of credits for future consumption. The ability to disconnect service for zero-balance accounts and reconnect immediately following payment effectively eliminates write-off risks. 

Bad debt decreased from almost $46,000 in 2011 to about $21,000 in 2013. Effective bad debt fell by 97%, from $44,000 in 2011 to just over $1,000 in 2013. Figure 13 shows Tri-State’s bad debt recovery levels from 2011-2013.

**Figure 13. Bad Debt Recovery from Tri-State’s Pre-Pay Program, 2011-2013.**

| Year | Debt Recovered Through Pre-Pay | Residential Bad Debt | Effective Residential Bad Debt |
|------|---------------------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------|
| 2011 | $45,780                         | $44,260              | $35,250                        |
| 2012 | $25,315                         | $9,930               | $21,005                        |
| 2013 | $19,870                         | $1,525               | $1,135                         |

### Web Portal Data Diagnoses High Bills and Helps Monitor Vacant Homes
Tri-State encourages customers to use the web portal to diagnose high bill issues. Customer service representatives also use the web portal to explain high bills and discuss possible causes such as weather conditions, changes in behavior or occupancy, or potential problems with heating and cooling equipment. Tri-State can set alerts for high consumption and send customers emails to warn about potentially high bills. In one case, usage monitoring alerted an out-of-town customer to a home break-in and theft because doors and windows were left open, and electric usage increased.

Tri-State plans to offer new time-of-use (TOU) rates to its customers, in conjunction with web portal access, to manage peak demand.

### Major Customer System Findings: New Rates and Demand-Side Management Capabilities
The emergence of AMI enabled the use of a new class of customer devices and systems that operate using smart meter load data and price signals from the utility to facilitate customer participation in electricity markets and encourage peak demand reduction. Using customer systems in concert with AMI upgrades, SGIG utilities piloted new time-based rate and incentive programs with more than 400,000 customers, demonstrated the integration of distributed energy resources, and conducted electric vehicle charging demonstrations.

### Green Button Initiative Improves Customer Data Access
The Green Button Initiative is an industry-led effort to develop a common technical standard and data format for customer usage information, helping customers access and understand their data and enabling software developers to create innovative applications. More than 60 million businesses and households are now served by utilities participating in the voluntary Green Button Initiative.

### Time-Based Rates and Direct Load Control
A total of 26 SGIG utilities piloted one or more time-based rates or incentive programs with a subset of their customers, and more than 417,000 customers participated in pilot rate programs under SGIG.

**Table 8. Rate Types Offered by SGIG Pilots**

| Rate Type                | SGIG Utilities Offering the Rate | Participating Customers Using the Rate |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Time-of-Use Rate         | 18                               | 63,360 customers                       |

| Critical Peak Rebates    | 7                                | 308,924 customers                      |
| Variable Peak Pricing    | 1                                | 37,461 customers                       |

### Distributed Energy Resource and Electric Vehicle Integration
Several SGIG projects used new AMI capabilities to test out DER integration at a small scale and pilot electric vehicle (EV) charging programs. AMI provides accurate time-stamping of energy consumption information, vital for the integration of EVs and DERs such as rooftop solar and thermal energy storage systems.

### Key Result: Improved Integration and Billing for DERs and EV Charging
AMI plays a crucial role in the customer adoption of DER by providing accurate information on on-site generation and storage usage, and on the amounts of excess generation delivered to local distribution grids through net metering mechanisms.

### Key Result: New Insights into Electric Vehicle Charging Patterns
SGIG AMI projects examined how AMI services can support the integration of electric vehicle charging and evaluated customer charging patterns under various rate options to help utilities anticipate how increased adoption of electric vehicles might affect peak and non-peak demand in the future.
