AMI System and Communications: Power line carrier communications modules relay data from smart 
meters, through substations, to Tri-State’s back office monitoring systems. The power line carrier 
decision was driven by the utility’s hilly geographical profile and low customer density, which make the 
business case for a wireless approach less financially attractive. An upgraded meter data management 
system (MDMS) provides a platform for validation, organization, analysis, and distribution of the meter 
data to other applications, including the billing system and the new customer web portal. 
Reduced Truck Rolls and Vehicle Miles: Tri-State avoided 13,000 truck rolls in the first two years 
following the deployment of 2,000 remote service switches on AMI meters, avoiding more than 51,800 
vehicle-miles traveled.

O&M Cost Savings and Improved Reliability: Tri-State realized a 65 percent decrease in annual meter 
operations costs from a high of about $450,000 per year in 2011, to about $156,000 per year in 2013. 
Tri-State’s SGIG AMI deployments began in 2010. Figure 12 provides a cost breakdown. Tri-State’s smart 
meters allow the utility to reconnect service without being notified by customers, detect outages in 
subdivisions with many vacant second homes, and prevent potential property damages such as frozen 
pipes that can burst from lack of heat. 
Operational savings, along with DOE co-funding under the SGIG program, contributed to a payback 
period of less than five years for Tri-State’s entire smart metering investment.

Reduced Bad Debt through Pre-Pay Program: Tri-State’s voluntary pre-pay plan has been a popular 
option with some customers in part because no deposit is required and there are no late fees (as the 
account always has a credit). Deposits for traditional accounts normally range from $100 to $300, and 
late fees are typically 5 percent of the balance due after the due date. With pre-pay, customers can 
establish service for $75, including $50 of credits for future consumption. With the ability to disconnect 
service for zero-balance accounts and reconnect service immediately following payment (with no wait or 
fees), Tri-State has effectively eliminated write-off risks because the account holders must maintain a 
credit to keep service active. 
Tri-State’s bad debt decreased from almost $46,000 in 2011 to about $21,000 in 2013. Effective bad 
debt fell by 97 percent, from $44,000 in 2011 to just over $1,000 in 2013. Figure 13 shows Tri-State’s 
bad debt recovery levels from 2011-2013.

Web Portal Data Diagnoses High Bills and Helps Monitor Vacant Homes: Tri-State encourages 
customers to use the web portal to diagnose high bill issues. Customer service representatives also use 
the web portal as a tool to explain high bills and discuss possible causes such as weather conditions, 
changes in behavior or occupancy, or potential problems with heating and cooling equipment. Tri-State 
can set alerts for high consumption and send customers emails to warn about potentially high bills. In 
one case, usage monitoring alerted an out-of-town customer to a home break-in and theft because 
doors and windows were left open and electric usage increased. 
Tri-State Electric Membership Corporation plans to offer new time-of-use (TOU) rates to its customers, 
in conjunction with web portal access, to manage peak demand.

AMI and Customer Systems: Results from the SGIG Program 
3  Major Customer System Findings: New Rates and 
Demand-Side Management Capabilities 
The emergence of AMI enabled the use of a new class of customer devices and systems that operate 
using smart meter load data and price signals from the utility to facilitate customer participation in 
electricity markets and encourage peak demand reduction. Using customer systems in concert with AMI 
upgrades, SGIG utilities were able to pilot new time-based rate and incentive programs with more than 
400,000 customers, demonstrate the integration of distributed energy resources, and conduct electric 
vehicle charging demonstrations.  
The ability to communicate electricity prices and consumption levels frequently is an essential feature of 
the SGIG demand-side projects. AMI enables load data at intervals of 5 minutes to 1 hour to be 
transmitted to utility back office systems where it can be processed and sent to billing systems. While 
bills are typically sent out monthly, information on electricity consumption can now be made available 
to customers via web portals or other programs the day after it has been collected by the utility.  
Green Button Initiative Improves Customer Data Access 
The Green Button Initiative is an industry-led effort to develop a common technical 
standard and data format for customer usage information—which helps customers 
access and understand data, and helps software developers create innovative 
applications consumers can use to make the most of their data. Championed at the 
federal level by the White House, the National Institute of Standards and 
Technology (NIST), and DOE, the technical standard was developed in collaboration 
with NIST and the Smart Grid Interoperability Panel.  
More than 60 million businesses and households are now served by utilities participating in the voluntary 
Green Button Initiative, including many involved in SGIG projects. There are almost 70 utilities, manufacturers, 
and government agencies participating in the Green Button Initiative, and 40 additional organizations are 
slated to join, further extending its reach to consumers. 
3.1  Time-Based Rates and Direct Load Control 
A total of 26 SGIG utilities piloted one or more time-based rates or incentive programs with a subset of 
their customers, and more than 417,000 customers participated in pilot rate programs under SGIG (see 
Table 8).

Time-based rates and incentive programs encourage customers to reduce electricity use during times of 
peak demand through price signals or rebates, with different prices offered at different times of the day 
or different days of the year. Figure 14 shows how different types of time-based rates—critical peak 
pricing (CPP), variable peak pricing (VPP), and time-of-use (TOU) pricing—can be used to reflect at an 
aggregate level the average of the marginal cost of producing electricity during various periods. Not 
shown in the figure is critical peak rebates (CPR), an incentive-based program that offers bill reductions 
to customers who reduce peak demand on critical-peak event days compared to baseline levels.  
Figure 14. An Illustration of Several Time-Based Rate Designs  
To help customers take advantage of these new rates and incentive programs, SGIG utilities installed 
customer-based systems that give customers the information and tools needed to actively or 
automatically manage their electricity consumption and costs:  
• 
Information technologies—including IHDs, web portals, and text/email alerts—alert 
customers of peak events in advance, deliver price signals, and provide electricity 
consumption data to help customers actively reduce or shift their use. Utilities typically 
delivered critical peak event alerts a day in advance through IHDs, cell phones, emails, web 
portal postings, and/or Twitter feeds. Customers with access to web portals could access their 
usage patterns by time of day to help determine how they could reduce their consumption 
during peak periods and examine their savings after an event.  
•  Control technologies—such as PCTs and DLC switches—enable utilities and customers to 
automatically manage electricity consumption. Customers can use PCT settings to 
automatically adjust heating and cooling temperatures in response to time-based rates. Utilities 
can send control signals to DLC devices to alter air conditioner and water heater cycling 
strategies, or turn on or off swimming pool and irrigation pumps.  
Customers receive rebates or bill credits for participating in DLC programs. Utilities are typically limited 
in the number of hours per year they can adjust customer equipment, and many DLC programs allow 
customers to opt out of specific DLC events. DLC programs do not require AMI; hundreds of electric 
48 
AMI and Customer Systems: Results from the SGIG Program 
utilities have implemented DLC programs successfully since the 1950s.14 While AMI can enhance DLC 
programs, very few utilities have tried to quantify these specific benefits, and DLC enhancements have 
not normally been included in a utility’s AMI business case.  
See the Consumer Behavior Studies for Further Results and Findings on Time-Based Rates 
A subset of 10 SGIG utilities participated in Consumer Behavior Studies (CBS), which applied 
experimental designs and randomized samples to evaluate customer acceptance, retention, and 
demand response to various time-based rates, incentive programs, and customers systems such as 
IHDs and PCTs. The CBS projects were successful in accomplishing randomized assignments for 
treatment and control groups, enabling the utilities to produce more reliable statistical results on the 
impacts of time-based rates, customer information systems, and customer automated control systems 
on peak demand, electricity consumption, and customer bills.  
This report includes only highlighted results. Please see the SGIG-CBS website for reports that include 
results and lessons learned from time-based rate programs under SGIG.  
Key Result: Reduced Peak Demand and Overall Consumption 
Time-based rate programs resulted in reduced peak demand for all projects, enabling some 
utilities to lower wholesale power purchase costs, sell excess electricity to regional markets, and defer 
investments in new generation and delivery capacity. In particular, the customers participating in time-
based rate programs piloted by 10 utilities conducting CBS reduced their peak demand by up to 23.5 
percent. Individual cost savings depended on the scale of the pilot, the rate type, and customer 
equipment.  
Several utilities found that offering PCTs that can automate customer 
response resulted in substantially higher peak demand reductions 
than programs that required active manual responses. Most utilities 
saw favorable cost-benefit ratios; for example, Oklahoma Gas and 
Electric decided to roll out a time-based rate with a free PCT to its entire residential customer class. 
→ See Case Study: 
Oklahoma Gas and Electric 
(page 30)  
In contrast, IHDs had no measured effect on peak demand, and in many cases, participating customers 
declined to use them. Technical issues with their operations, including interoperability problems with 
smart meters, affected IHD effectiveness and in one case, the manufacturer decided to halt production 
and stop support. This decision reflected the relative immaturity of the market for customer systems at 
the time.  
CPP and CPR effectively provide financial incentives for customers to reduce peak demand and 
customers typically remained enrolled for several years. With PCTs, customers enrolled in rate programs 
showed similar reductions in peak demand; without PCTs, CPP programs generally achieved greater 
reductions as compared to CPR programs. Several SGIG utilities planned system-wide deployments of 
these types of rates based on the results of their pilot-program evaluations.

One CBS study found that enrollment rates for opt-out recruitment 
strategies were about 3.5 times higher than they were for programs that 
required participants to opt-in (93% vs. 24%). Peak demand reductions 
were also generally larger under opt-in recruitment programs—twice as 
large in SMUD’s CBS study. Retention rates were about the same for both 
approaches.

Valley Energy (page 60)  
Cost-effective time-based rate programs can often provide the tipping 
point for financially justifying AMI and customer system investments. The potential benefits of time-
based rate programs depend on local power supply conditions, demand growth, and regulatory policies. 
Many states offer financial incentives for utilities to implement DSM measures, particularly energy-
efficiency programs. AMI can help improve and expand rate program offerings, by providing detailed 
data on electricity use levels and patterns for impact analysis. 
Key Result: Customer Bill Savings 
By participating in DSM programs, customers can see financial benefits through bill savings and 
rebates, and gain greater control to manage consumption and costs. Information technologies and web 
portals helped customers learn about their patterns of electricity 
consumption and identify steps they can take to conserve electricity or 
shift their usage. Several of the SGIG projects measured customer bill 
savings from their rate programs over different time scales (see Table 9).

AMI and Customer Systems: Results from the SGIG Program 
Customers who choose time-based rate programs may see bill increases, compared to standard rates, 
if they do not lower or shift their consumption during peak periods. Customers may only see bill 
savings if they made changes to shift consumption, or were already low 
consumers, during peak periods. For example, Sacramento Municipal 
Utility District (SMUD) found that while DLC pilot participants with TOU-
CPP rates generally saved about 50 percent more than those with standard 
rates, some customers saw bill increases.  
3.2  Distributed Energy Resource and Electric Vehicle Integration 
Several SGIG projects used new AMI capabilities to test out DER integration at a small scale and pilot 
electric vehicle (EV) charging programs to gain insight into the charging habits of EV drivers and their 
effect on the system. AMI provides accurate time-stamping of energy consumption information, which is 
vital for the integration of EVs and DERs such as rooftop solar and thermal energy storage systems. Both 
EVs and DERs could have potentially large impacts on the size and timing of electricity demand as the 
→ See Case Study: 
Sacramento Municipal Utility 
District (page 53)  
market for these technologies grow.  
Key Result: Improved Integration and Billing for DERs and EV Charging 
AMI plays a useful role in the customer adoption of DER by providing accurate information of on-site 
generation and storage usage, and on the amounts of excess generation delivered to local distribution 
grids through net metering mechanisms. In some cases, using AMI to sub-meter rooftop photovoltaic 
installations and energy storage units can boost accuracy and effectiveness of net metering at customer 
sites.15 Fourteen projects used AMI to offer net metering rates—the rates customers with on-site 
generation are paid for selling their excess energy back to the grid—which are used to incentivize 
customer installation and ownership of distributed energy resources (DER).  
Burbank Water and Power and Glendale Water and Power in California 
both integrated AMI with thermal energy storage systems for on-peak 
cooling of commercial and municipal buildings.  
→ See Case Study: Glendale 
Water and Power (page 56)  
Groton Utilities (GU), a member of the Connecticut Municipal Electric Energy Cooperative, is using AMI 
to record generation and usage, credit output, and billing for solar-assisted homes. GU provides two 
smart meters at each residential solar installation—one that records bi-directional power (from the 
utility system into the house, and excess power from the solar panels back out) and one that measures 
the total generation from the solar panels. This combination allows GU to provide a credit to the 
customer for generation back on to the GU system and a means for calculating total house usage, a 
requirement in GU’s rate.

Key Result: New Insights into Electric Vehicle Charging Patterns 
SGIG AMI projects also examined how AMI services can support the integration of electric 
vehicle charging, and evaluated customer charging patterns under various rate options to help utilities 
anticipate how increased adoption of electric vehicles might affect peak and non-peak demand in the 
future. Though they represent a small portion of the more than 260 million U.S. passenger vehicles, 
electric vehicles are expected to grow from nearly 296,000 in 2014 to more than 2.7 million in 2023.16 
AMI investments contribute to the establishment of EV markets in several ways. Smart meters can be 
used to offer customers TOU rates for EVs to provide financial incentives for customers to charge 
vehicles during off-peak periods. The meters also provide valuable data 
for EV manufacturers and utilities on customer charging patterns, and 
to assess the grid impacts of different types of chargers, including 
standard (120 volts) and alternative chargers (240 and 480 volts). 
Looking to the future, AMI can contribute to advanced concepts like 
vehicle-to-grid applications where utilities can have access to EV storage 
capacity for meeting system needs.17
