User: How to implement serverless backend logic with AWS Lambda and API Gateway?
Assistant: The combination of AWS Lambda and API Gateway enables serverless backend logic. The following are the implementation steps: 1. Create a Lambda function: Create a Lambda function in the AWS Lambda console, and write the code to process the request. This code should be able to handle requests sent by API Gateway and other triggers. 2. Create API Gateway: Create a REST API in the API Gateway console. Once created, resources and methods can be added, and their request and response parameters defined. 3. Integrate the Lambda function: Integrate the API Gateway with the Lambda function, so that the API Gateway can forward the received request to the Lambda function. 4. Deploy API Gateway: In the API Gateway console, deploy API Gateway to one or more stages. After the deployment is complete, API Gateway will create a unique URL for each stage. 5. Test API Gateway: Use the URL of API Gateway to test the integration of API Gateway and Lambda functions. You can use HTTP tools such as Postman or curl to send requests and view the response results.
