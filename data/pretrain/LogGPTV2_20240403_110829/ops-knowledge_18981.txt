User: Please introduce the basic principles and common indicators of the monitoring system, and how to use the monitoring system to find and solve problems in a timely manner.
Assistant: The basic principle of the monitoring system: The monitoring system realizes real-time monitoring and early warning of the status of the monitored object through the process of continuous collection, analysis, judgment and alarm. The system is generally composed of subsystems such as data acquisition, data transmission, data processing and analysis, and alarm. Commonly used indicators: 1. The use of resources such as CPU, memory, disk, and network of the system; 2. Performance indicators of applications, such as request response time, throughput, etc.; 3. Key business indicators (KPI), such as conversion rate, 4. Abnormal situations, such as service unavailability, error response, etc. Use the monitoring system to find and solve problems in a timely manner: 1. Regularly check the monitoring indicators to identify potential problems for timely processing; 2. Set up early warning rules, once the abnormal indicators are found to exceed the threshold, an alarm signal will be issued immediately; 3. Define a reasonable monitoring strategy, It may include real-time monitoring, on-demand monitoring, historical data analysis and other methods; 4. Constantly update monitoring indicators and alarm rules to maintain sensitivity and effectiveness; solve.
