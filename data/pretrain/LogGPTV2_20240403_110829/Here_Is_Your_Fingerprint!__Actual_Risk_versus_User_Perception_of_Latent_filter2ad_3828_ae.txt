e.g., li(cid:138)le (cid:128)ngers, that are rarely or never used on a touch screen. It
is also considerable to ask dual (cid:128)nger submission for Touch ID, but
behavioral mitigation would lay a burden. (cid:140)e technical mitigation,
such as the under-screen Touch ID with slide bar, is more preferred.
7 CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we presented the SCRAP a(cid:138)ack and conducted both
experimental and user-survey studies regarding the gap between
actual risk and user perception of the latent (cid:128)ngerprints le(cid:137) on
smartphones. We showed that the SCRAP a(cid:138)ack is actual risk while
user perception is very low, and we discussed mitigation methods.
As pictured in Figure 17 in Appendix I, it is possible to unlock
Touch ID with much smaller portion of (cid:128)ngerprint. (cid:140)is suggests
the higher success rate of our a(cid:138)ack than the result shown in this
paper. Furthermore, the combination method can be generalized
to utilize more than one matched Ti images. In the future study,
we plan to replace the (cid:128)ngerprint collection method (photography)
with easier scanning, and examine the whole area of Ts to (cid:128)nd a
portion having be(cid:138)er quality. A large-scale study is also promising.

A SUMMARY OF FINGERPRINT FORGERY
ATTACKS ON SMARTPHONES
In Section 2, we described (cid:128)ngerprint forgery a(cid:138)acks on smart-
phone touch sensors, disclosed by various parties in public videos,
such as in YouTube. We summarize them in part in Table 4.
B PHOTOGRAPHIC SETTING
In our experiments, the smartphone was placed on a work bench 74
cm high from the ground. We set the angle between the camera lens
and the smartphone at 60 degrees, and the distance to 15 cm, which
was 10 cm closer than [2] to reduce re(cid:131)ection and di(cid:130)usion in full
close-up photography. (cid:140)e 174 cm high light was placed at a vertical
angle of 35 degrees (i.e., the light illuminated the smartphone at
a 55 (= 90 − 35) degree angle) with a distance of 178 cm from
the smartphone surface, and a horizontal angle of 12 degrees. We
decided this setup as a default setup because it performed the best
in our pilot study (Figure 12).
C SIFT DESCRIPTOR BASED EXACT
MATCHING
For (cid:128)ngerprint smudge matching in Section 3.3, we performed the
SIFT descriptor-based brute-force matching on H and Ti. (cid:140)is step
was necessary for selecting Ts which was closest to H. Subsequently,
we had to perform the SIFT descriptor-based exact matching on H
and Ts because they were taken from di(cid:130)erent locations, H from
the home bu(cid:138)on and Ts from somewhere in the touch screen. (cid:140)e
conceptual procedure of the SIFT descriptor-based exact matching
is shown in Figure 13. H and Ts, which were already SIFT-matched,
are overlapped based on the shortest matched descriptors (denoted
as blue dots). We could then observe a slight di(cid:130)erence between
the second shortest matched descriptors, respectively, denoted as
blue and yellow circles Figure 13-(a). (cid:140)is di(cid:130)erence may a(cid:130)ect the
di(cid:130)erence in the (cid:128)ngerprint ridges between H and Ts. Correction
is therefore necessary. In this example, we obtain the exact match
Figure 14: (cid:135)e inner area of H.
by (cid:128)xing the di(cid:130)erence based on the SIFT-descriptors, that is, by
(cid:128)xing the slope as shown in Figure 13-(b).
D INNER AREA OF HOME BUTTON
We de(cid:128)ne the inner area of H as the blocs marked with yellow
circles (Hu) and × mark (Hd) in Figure 14. (cid:140)at is, the inner area
means the blocks that are free from the Ring of Touch ID. bH inner
of Algorithm 2 is the number of blocks in the inner area, and is (cid:128)xed
as 52. nH inner is the number of blocks which have more keypoints
than τ, i.e.,the number of blocks marked with circles in Figure 14. In
our example of Section 3, nH inner = 26. (cid:140)e threshold value 0.6 of
nH inner / bH inner in Algorithm 2 was set due to the possibility
of half submission success as shown in Figure 17-(c).
E SMUDGE PHOTOGRAPHY EXAMPLES
In section 4, we described the our a(cid:138)ack experiments in various
realistic scenarios. (cid:140)e example snapshots are shown in Figure 15.

which (cid:128)ngertips are used for touching both Touch ID and touch
screen, and how you perceive Touch ID and latent (cid:128)ngerprints
remaining on your iPhone. (cid:140)is survey should be only taken by
users whose iPhone supports Touch ID. Your responses to survey
questions are completely anonymous, and will be destroyed a(cid:137)er
the end of experiment. (cid:140)e Yonsei University Institutional Review
Board (IRB) has approved the use of human participants for this
survey. It will take approximately 10 minutes. Please feel free to
provide any comments and feedback on the survey”.
2. A(cid:137)er the participant read and agreed with the consent form,
verify that the participant has iPhone which supports Touch ID

20 minutes.
4. Verify enrolled (cid:128)ngerprints and unlocking actions for four
