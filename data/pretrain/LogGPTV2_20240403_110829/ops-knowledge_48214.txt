User: How to add HTTPS support to a web application?
Assistant: To add HTTPS support for a web application, the following steps are required: 1. Obtain an SSL certificate: first, you need to obtain a valid SSL certificate, which can be purchased or applied for free from some reputable CA institutions (such as Let's Encrypt, Comodo, etc.) . 2. Install the SSL certificate: The SSL certificate contains a public key and a private key, and needs to be installed on the web server. 3. Configure the web server: HTTPS support needs to be configured on the web server, including specifying the certificate path and port. 4. Redirection: In order to ensure that visitors always use HTTPS connections, you need to add redirection rules to automatically redirect HTTP requests to HTTPS. 5. Testing: In order to ensure that the HTTPS support is working properly, some testing is required, including manually entering HTTPS URLs, checking the lock symbol in the browser address bar, checking access logs, etc.
