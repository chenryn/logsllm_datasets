you add an anti-virus product to your computers.
 Detective. This type of control is used to identify the details of a security incident, including (sometimes)
the attacker.
 Corrective. A corrective control implements a fix after a security incident occurs.
 Deterrent. This type of control attempts to discourage attackers. For example, you lock your office
whenever you leave for lunch or go home for the day.
 Recovery. A recovery control tries to get the environment back to where it was prior to a security incident.
 Compensating. A compensating control is an alternative control to reduce a risk. Suppose you need to
enable outside users to get to your SharePoint site, which resides on your local area network. Instead of
16
opening the firewall to permit communication from the internet to your internal SharePoint servers, you
can implement a compensating control, such as deploying a reverse proxy to the perimeter network and
enabling SharePoint external access through the reverse proxy. In the end, the functionality is typically the
same, but the method of getting there is different.
 Security Control Assessment (SCA). You need to periodically assess your security controls. What’s working? What
isn’t working? As part of this assessment, the existing document must be thoroughly reviewed, and some of the
controls must be tested at random. A report is typically produced to show the outcomes and enable the
organization to remediate deficiencies.
 Monitoring and measurement. Monitoring and measurement are closely aligned with identifying risks. For
example, if there are many invalid database query attempts coming from your web server, it might indicate an
attack. At a minimum, it is worth investigating. Whether action is required will depend. Without the proper
monitoring in place, you won’t know about these types of events. You might not know when a person is probing
your network. Even if you are capturing monitoring information, it isn’t enough by itself. You also need a way to
measure it. For example, if your monitoring shows 500 invalid logon attempts on your web server today, is that a
cause for concern? Or is that typical because you have 75,000 users? While monitoring is used for more than
security purposes, you need to tune it to ensure you are notified about potential security incidents as soon as
possible. In some cases, it will be too late and a data breach might occur. That’s when the monitoring data becomes
valuable from a forensics perspective. You need to be able to look back at the data and figure out why you didn’t
see anything during the incident and what adjustments you need to make to minimize the chances of it happening
again.
 Asset valuation. When you think of assets, don’t just think of physical assets such as computers and office
furniture (tangible assets). Assets also include the company’s data and intellectual property (intangible assets).
While tangible assets are easy to assess for value (for example, you bought the disk drive for $250), data and
intellectual property can be harder to place a value on. Be familiar with the following strategies of intangible asset
valuation:
 Cost approach. How much would it cost to replace the asset?
 Income approach. How much income will the asset produce over its lifetime?
 Market approach. How much does a similar asset cost?
 Quantitative approach. Assigns a dollar value to assess risk.
 Qualitative approach. Assigns a score to assess risk.
 Reporting. One of the foundations of an enterprise-grade security solution is the ability to report on your
environment (what you have, what the top risks are, what’s happening right now, what happened 3 days ago, etc.).
Reporting provides information. And that information is sometimes used to start a continuous improvement
process.
 Continuous improvement. Continuous improvement is an ongoing, never-ending effort to take what you have
and improve it. Often, improvements are small and incremental. However, over time, small improvements can add
up. Continuous improvement can be applied to products (for example, upgrading to the latest version), services
17
(for example, expanding your internal phishing testing) or processes (for example, automating processes to save
time and improve consistency).
 Risk frameworks. A risk framework documents how your organization handles risk assessment, risk resolution
and ongoing monitoring. See http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-37r1.pdf for an
example of a risk framework. There are other risk frameworks, such as the British Standard BS 31100. Be familiar
with risk frameworks and their goals. The NIST framework identifies the following steps: categorize, select,
implement, assess, authorize and monitor.
1.10 Understand and apply threat modeling concepts and methodologies
When you perform threat modeling for your organization, you document potential threats and prioritize those threats
(often by putting yourself in an attacker’s mindset). There are four well-known methods. STRIDE, introduced at Microsoft in
1999, focuses on spoofing of user identity, tampering, repudiation, information disclosure, denial of service and elevation
of privilege. PASTA (process for attack simulation and threat analysis) provides dynamic threat identification, enumeration
and scoring. Trike uses threat models based on a requirements model. VAST (visual, agile and simple threat modeling)
applies across IT infrastructure and software development without requiring security experts.
 Threat modeling methodologies. Part of the job of the security team is to identify threats. You can identify threats
using different methods:
 Focus on attackers. This is a useful method in specific situations. For example, suppose that a developer’s
employment is terminated. After extracting data from the developer’s computer, you determine that the
person was disgruntled and angry at the management team. You now know this person is a threat and can
focus on what he or she might want to achieve. However, outside of specific situations like this,
organizations are usually not familiar with their attackers.
 Focus on assets. Your organization’s most valuable assets are likely to be targeted by attackers. For
example, if you have a large number of databases, the database with the HR and employee information
might be the most sought after.
 Focus on software. Many organizations develop applications in house, either for their own use or for
customer use. You can look at your software as part of your threat identification efforts. The goal isn’t to
identify every possible attack, but instead to focus on the big picture, such as whether the applications are
susceptible to DoS or information disclosure attacks.
 Threat modeling concepts. If you understand the threats to your organization, then you are ready to document
the potential attack vectors. You can use diagramming to list the various technologies under threat. For example,
suppose you have a SharePoint server that stores confidential information and is therefore a potential target. You
can diagram the environment integrating with SharePoint. You might list the edge firewalls, the reverse proxy in
the perimeter network, the SharePoint servers in the farm and the database servers. Separately, you might have a
diagram showing SharePoint’s integration with Active Directory and other applications. You can use these diagrams
to identify attack vectors against the various technologies.

1.11 Apply risk-based management concepts to the supply chain
Organizations must use risk-based management concepts when they contract out tasks (such as hiring an air conditioning
company to maintain the air conditioning in their data centers), bring on new suppliers or utilize service companies to
transport their goods. Many of these concepts apply to mergers and acquisitions too.
 Risks associated with hardware, software, and services. The company should perform due diligence, which
includes looking at the IT infrastructure of the supplier. When thinking about the risk considerations, you must
consider:
 Hardware. Is the company using antiquated hardware that introduces potential availability issues? Is the
company using legacy hardware that isn’t being patched by the vendor? Will there be integration issues
with the hardware?
 Software. Is the company using software that is out of support, or from a vendor that is no longer in
business? Is the software up to date on security patches? Are there other security risks associated with the
software?
 Services. Does the company provide services for other companies or to end users? Is the company reliant
on third-party providers for services (such as SaaS apps)? Did the company evaluate service providers in a
way that enables your company to meet its requirements? Does the company provide services to your
competitors? If so, does that introduce any conflicts of interest?
 Third-party assessment and monitoring. Before agreeing to do business with another company, your
organization needs to learn as much as it can about that company. Often, third-party assessments are used to help
gather information and perform the assessment. An on-site assessment is useful to gain information about
physical security and operations. During the document review, your goal is to thoroughly review all the architecture,
designs, implementations, policies, procedures, etc. You need to have a good understanding of the current state
of the environment, especially so you can understand any shortcomings or compliance issues prior to integrating
the IT infrastructures. You need to ensure that the other company’s infrastructure meets all your company’s
security and compliance requirements. The level of access and depth of information you are able to gain is often
directly related to how closely your companies will work together. For example, if a company is your primary
supplier of a critical hardware component, then a thorough assessment is critical. If the company is one of 3
delivery companies used to transport goods from your warehouse, then the assessment is important but does not
have to be as deep.
 Minimum security requirements. As part of the assessment, the minimum security requirements must be
established. In some cases, the minimum security requirements are your company’s security requirements. In
other cases, new minimum security requirements are established. In such scenarios, the minimum security
requirements should have a defined period, such as 12 months.
 Service-level requirements. A final area to review involves service level agreements (SLAs). Companies have SLAs
for internal operations (such as how long it takes for the helpdesk to respond to a new ticket), for customers (such
as the availability of a public-facing service), and for partner organizations (such as how much support a vendor
provides a partner). All the SLAs of the company should be reviewed. Your company sometimes has an SLA
standard that should be applied, when possible, to the SLAs as part of working with another company. This can
19
sometimes take time, as the acquiring company might have to support established SLAs until they expire or
renewal comes up.
1.12 Establish and maintain a security awareness, education, and training
program
This section of the exam covers all the aspects of ensuring that everybody in your organization is security conscious and
familiar with the organization’s policies and procedures. In general, it is most effective to start with an awareness campaign
and then provide detailed training. For example, teaching everybody about malware or phishing campaigns before they
understand the bigger picture of risk isn’t very effective.
 Methods and techniques to present awareness and training. While the information security team is typically
well-versed on security, the rest of the organization often isn’t. As part of having a well-rounded security program,
the organization must provide security education, training and awareness to the entire staff. Employees need to
understand what to be aware of (types of threats, such as phishing or free USB sticks), understand how to perform
their jobs securely (encrypt sensitive data, physically protect valuable assets), and how security plays a role in the
big picture (company reputation, profits and losses). Training should be mandatory and provided both to new
employees and yearly (at a minimum) for ongoing training. Routine tests of operational security should be
performed (such as tailgating at company doors and social engineering tests like phishing campaigns).
 Periodic content reviews. Threats are complex and the training needs to be relevant and interesting to be
effective. This means updating training materials and awareness training, and changing out the ways which security
is tested and measured. If you always use the same phishing test campaign or send it from the same account on
the same day of the year, it isn’t effective. The same applies to other material. Instead of relying on long and detailed
security documentation for training and awareness, consider using internal social media tools, videos and
interactive campaigns.
 Program effectiveness evaluation. Time and money must be allocated for evaluating the company’s security
awareness and training. The company should track key metrics, such as the percentage of employees clicking on a
link in a test phishing email. Is the awareness and training bringing the total number of clicks down? If so, the
program is effective. If not, you need to re-evaluate it.
