User: I have an application written in Python that's writing large amounts of data to the %TEMP% folder.  Oddly, every once and awhile, it dies, returning IOError: [Errno 28] No space left on device.  The drive has plenty of free space, %TEMP% is not its own partition, I'm an administrator, and the system has no quotas.
Does Windows artificially put some types of limits on the data in %TEMP%?  If not, any ideas on what could be causing this issue?
EDIT: Following discussions below, I clarified the question to better explain what's going on.
Assistant: There should be no trouble whatsoever with regard to your %TEMP% directory.  
What is your disk quota set to for %TEMP%'s hosting volume?  Depending in part on what the apps themselves are doing, one of them may be throwing an error due to the disk quota being reached, which is a pain if this quota is set unreasonably high.  If the quota is very high, try lowering it, which you can do as Administrator.
