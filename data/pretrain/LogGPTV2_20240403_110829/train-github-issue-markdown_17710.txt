### Version
2.4.1
### Reproduction link
https://github.com/tiagofelipe/vue-store-bug
### Steps to reproduce
In src/app/auth/services/auth.js i need to import the store "import store from
'../../../store'", but an error occurred:
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'state' of undefined
Turns out I wasted a lot of time trying to understand the problem, and then I
realized that one of the vuex modules was not being loaded, called auth.
After several tests, I discovered that, inside my import file of the store
modules "src/app/store.js" the following problem occurred:
import {store as auth} from './auth' - always returns the error even though I
changing the address to './auth/index.js'
Then I duplicated the file './auth/index.js' with a new name
'./auth/teste.js', keeping the code identical in both files, and changed the
import to:
import {store as auth} from './auth/teste' - this made it work
Without understanding why this happens, I decided to report the problem.
If I remove the import store from file 'src/app/auth/services/auth.js', the
application returns to normal operation, vuex also works normally and can even
load the auth module.
### What is expected?
Load vuex modules and application work
### What is actually happening?
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'state' of undefined
