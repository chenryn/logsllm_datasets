When downloading the latest NuGet package for Lodash, two versions of the library are being included: version 4.0 and version 3.10. This results in a compilation error due to duplicate declarations. 

To resolve this issue, you should ensure that only one version of Lodash is referenced in your project. You can do this by checking your project's dependencies and removing the older version (3.10) if version 4.0 is the one you intend to use.
