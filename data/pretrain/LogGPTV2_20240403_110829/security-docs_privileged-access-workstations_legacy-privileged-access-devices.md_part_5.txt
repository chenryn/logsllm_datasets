         > [!NOTE]
         > The "SCM Windows 11 - Domain Security" GPO might be linked to the domain independently of PAW, but will affect the entire domain.
1. (Optional) Install other required tools for Tier 1 Admins. Install any other tools or scripts required to perform job duties. Ensure to evaluate the risk of credential exposure on the target computers with any tool before adding it to a PAW.
1. Identify and safely obtain software and applications required for administration. This is similar to the work performed in Phase 1, but with a broader scope due to the increased number of applications, services, and systems being secured.
   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Ensure that you protect these new applications (including web browsers) by opting them into the protections provided by Windows Defender Exploit Guard.
   * Examples of other software and applications include:
      * Service or application management software based on the Microsoft Management Console
      * Proprietary (non-MMC-based) service or application management software
         > [!NOTE]
         > Many applications are now exclusively managed via web browsers, including many cloud services. While this reduces the number of applications which need to be installed on a PAW, it also introduces the risk of browser interoperability issues. You might need to deploy a non-Microsoft web browser on to specific PAW instances to enable administration of specific services. If you do deploy an additional web browser, ensure that you follow all clean source principles and secure the browser according to the vendor's security guidance.
1. (Optional) Download and install any required management agents.
   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > If you choose to install additional management agents (monitoring, security, configuration management, etc.), it is vital that you ensure the management systems are trusted at the same level as domain controllers and identity systems.
1. Assess your infrastructure to identify systems that require the more security protections provided by a PAW. Ensure that you know exactly which systems must be protected. Ask critical questions about the resources themselves, such as:
   * Where are the target systems that must be managed?  Are they collected in a single physical location, or connected to a single well-defined subnet?
   * How many systems are there?
   * Do these systems depend on other systems (virtualization, storage, etc.), and if so, how are those systems managed?  How are the critical systems exposed to these dependencies, and what are the other risks associated with those dependencies?
   * How critical are the services being managed, and what is the expected loss if those services are compromised?
      > [!IMPORTANT]
      > Include your cloud services in this assessment - attackers increasingly target insecure cloud deployments, and it is vital that you administer those services as securely as you would your on-premises mission-critical applications.
        Use this assessment to identify the specific systems that require extra protection, and then extend your PAW program to the administrators of those systems. Common examples of systems that benefit greatly from PAW-based administration include SQL Server (both on-premises and SQL Azure), human resources applications, and financial software.
        > [!NOTE]
        > If a resource is managed from a Windows system, it can be managed with a PAW, even if the application itself runs on an operating system other than Windows or on a non-Microsoft cloud platform. For example, the owner of a cloud service provider subscription should only use a PAW to administer that account.
1. Develop a request and distribution method for deploying PAWs at scale in your organization. Depending on the number of PAWs you choose to deploy in Phase 2, you might need to automate the process.
    * Consider developing a formal request and approval process for administrators to use to obtain a PAW. This process would help standardize the deployment process, ensure accountability for PAW devices, and help identify gaps in PAW deployment.
    * As stated previously, this deployment solution should be separate from existing automation methods (which might have already been compromised) and should follow the principles outlined in Phase 1.
      > [!IMPORTANT]
      > Any system which manages resources should itself managed at the same or higher trust level.
1. Review and if necessary deploy more PAW hardware profiles. The hardware profile you chose for Phase 1 deployment might not be suitable for all administrators. Review the hardware profiles and if appropriate select other PAW hardware profiles to match the needs of the administrators. For example, the dedicated hardware profile (separate PAW and daily use workstations) might be unsuitable for an administrator who travels often.
1. Consider the cultural, operational, communications, and training needs that accompany an extended PAW deployment. Such a significant change to an administrative model will naturally require change management to some degree, and it's essential to build that into the deployment project itself. Consider at a minimum the following questions:
   * How will you communicate the changes to senior leadership to ensure their support?  Any project without senior leadership backing is likely to fail, or struggle for funding and broad acceptance.
   * How will you document the new process for administrators? These changes must be documented and communicated not only to existing administrators (who must change their habits and manage resources in a different way), but also for new administrators (those promoted from within or hired from outside the organization). It's essential that the documentation is clear and fully articulates:
      * The importance of the threats
      * The role of PAW in protecting administrators.
      * How to use a PAW correctly.
      > [!IMPORTANT]
      > This is especially important for roles with high turnover, including but not limited to help desk personnel.
   * How to ensure compliance with the new process? While the PAW model includes several technical controls to prevent the exposure of privileged credentials, it's impossible to fully prevent all possible exposure purely using technical controls. For example, although it's possible to prevent an administrator from successfully logging on to a user desktop with privileged credentials, the simple act of attempting the logon can expose the credentials to malware installed on that user desktop. It's therefore essential that you articulate not only the benefits of the PAW model, but the risks of noncompliance. This should be complemented by auditing and alerting so that credential exposure can be quickly detected and addressed.
### Phase 3: Extend and enhance protection
Scope: These protections enhance the systems built in Phase 1, bolstering the basic protection with advanced features including Multifactor authentication and network access rules.
> [!NOTE]
> This phase can be performed at any time after Phase 1 has been completed. It is not dependent on completion of Phase 2, and thus can be performed before, concurrent with, or after Phase 2.
Complete the following steps to configure this phase:
1. **Enable multifactor authentication for privileged accounts**. Multifactor authentication strengthens account security by requiring the user to provide a physical token in addition to credentials. Multifactor authentication complements authentication policies well, but it doesn't depend on authentication policies for deployment (and, similarly, authentication policies don't require Multifactor authentication). Microsoft recommends using one of these forms of Multifactor authentication:
   * **Smart card**: A smart card is a tamper-resistant and portable physical device that provides a second verification during the Windows logon process. By requiring an individual to possess a card for logon, you can reduce the risk of stolen credentials being reused remotely. For details on smart card logon in Windows, refer to the article [Smart Card Overview](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-R2-and-2012/hh831433(v=ws.11)).
   * **Virtual smart card**: A virtual smart card provides the same security benefits as physical smart cards, with the added benefit of being linked to specific hardware. For details on deployment and hardware requirements, refer to the articles, [Virtual Smart Card Overview](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-8.1-and-8/dn593708(v=ws.11)) and [Get Started with Virtual Smart Cards: Walkthrough Guide](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-8.1-and-8/dn579260(v=ws.11)).
   * **Windows Hello for Business**: Windows Hello for Business lets users authenticate to a Microsoft account, an Active Directory account, a Microsoft Entra account, or non-Microsoft service that supports Fast ID Online (FIDO) authentication. After an initial two-step verification during Windows Hello for Business enrollment, a Windows Hello for Business is set up on the user's device and the user sets a gesture, which can be Windows Hello or a PIN. Windows Hello for Business credentials are an asymmetric key pair, which can be generated within isolated environments of Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs).
      * For more information on Windows Hello for Business read [Windows Hello for Business](/windows/security/identity-protection/hello-for-business/hello-identity-verification) article.
   * **Azure Multifactor authentication**: Azure Multifactor authentication (MFA) provides the security of a second verification factor and enhanced protection through monitoring and machine-learning-based analysis. Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication can secure not only Azure administrators but many other solutions as well, including web applications, Microsoft Entra ID, and on-premises solutions like remote access and Remote Desktop. For more information, see the article [Multifactor authentication](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/multi-factor-authentication).
1. **Allow list trusted applications using Windows Defender Application Control and/or AppLocker**. By limiting the ability of untrusted or unsigned code to run on a PAW, you further reduce the likelihood of malicious activity and compromise. Windows includes two primary options for application control:
   * **AppLocker**: AppLocker helps administrators control which applications can run on a given system. AppLocker can be centrally controlled through group policy, and applied to specific users or groups (for targeted application to users of PAWs). For more information on AppLocker, see the TechNet article [AppLocker Overview](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-R2-and-2012/hh831440(v=ws.11)).
   * **Windows Defender Application Control**: the new Windows Defender Application Control feature provides enhanced hardware-based application control that, unlike AppLocker, can't be overridden on the impacted device. Like AppLocker, Windows Defender Application Control can be controlled via group policy and targeted to specific users. For more information on restricting application usage with Windows Defender Application Control, see [Windows Defender Application Control Deployment Guide](/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-control/windows-defender-application-control-deployment-guide).
1. **Use Protected Users, Authentication Policies, and Authentication Silos to further protect privileged accounts**. The members of Protected Users are subject to extra security policies that protect the credentials stored in the local security agent (LSA) and greatly minimize the risk of credential theft and reuse. Authentication policies and silos control how privileged users can access resources in the domain. Collectively, these protections dramatically strengthen the account security of these privileged users. For more information on these features, see the article [How to Configure Protected Accounts](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-R2-and-2012/dn518179(v=ws.11)).
   > [!NOTE]
   > These protections are meant to complement, not replace, existing security measures in Phase 1. Administrators should still use separate accounts for administration and general use.
## Managing and updating
PAWs must have anti-malware capabilities and software updates must be rapidly applied to maintain integrity of these workstations.
Extra configuration management, operational monitoring, and security management can also be used with PAWs. The integration of these capabilities must be considered carefully because each of them introduces risk of PAW compromise through that tool. Whether it makes sense to introduce advanced management capabilities depends on several factors including:
* The security state and practices of the management capability (including software update practices for the tool, administrative roles and accounts in those roles, operating systems the tool is hosted on or managed from, and any other hardware or software dependencies of that tool)
* The frequency and quantity of software deployments and updates on your PAWs
* Requirements for detailed inventory and configuration information
* Security monitoring requirements
* Organizational standards and other organizational-specific factors
Per the clean source principle, all tools used to manage or monitor the PAWs must be trusted at or above the level of the PAWs. This process typically requires those tools to be managed from a PAW to ensure no security dependency from lower privilege workstations.
This table outlines different approaches that might be used to manage and monitor the PAWs:
|Approach|Considerations|
|------|---------|
|Default in PAW-   Windows Server Update Services-   Windows Defender|-   No extra cost-   Performs basic required security functions-   Instructions included in this guidance|
|Manage with [Intune](/mem/intune/)|Provides cloud-based visibility and controlSoftware Deploymento   Manage software updatesWindows Firewall policy managementAnti-malware protectionRemote assistanceSoftware license management.No server infrastructure requiredRequires following "Enable Connectivity to Cloud Services" steps in Phase 2If the PAW computer isn't joined to a domain, this configuration requires applying the SCM baselines to the local images using the tools provided in the security baseline download.|
|New System Center instance(s) for managing PAWs|-   Provides visibility and control of configuration, software deployment, and security updates-   Requires separate server infrastructure, securing it to level of PAWs, and staffing skills for those highly privileged personnel|
|Manage PAWs with existing management tool(s)|-   Creates significant risk to compromise of PAWs unless the existing management infrastructure is brought up to security level of PAWs **Note:**     Microsoft would generally discourage this approach unless your organization has a specific reason to use it. In our experience, there's typically a high cost of bringing all these tools (and their security dependencies) up to the security level of the PAWs.-   Most of these tools provide visibility and control of configuration, software deployment, and security updates|
|Security Scanning or monitoring tools requiring admin access|Includes any tool that installs an agent or requires an account with local administrative access.-   Requires bringing tool security assurance up to level of PAWs.-   Might require lowering security posture of PAWs to support tool functionality (open ports, install Java or other middleware, etc.), creating a security trade-off decision,|
|Security information and event management (SIEM)|If SIEM is agentlessCan access events on PAWs without administrative access by using an account in the **Event Log Readers** groupRequires opening up network ports to allow inbound traffic from the SIEM serversIf SIEM requires an agent, see other row **Security Scanning or monitoring tools requiring admin access**.|
|Windows Event Forwarding|-   Provides an agentless method of forwarding security events from the PAWs to an external collector or SIEM-   Can access events on PAWs without administrative access-   Doesn't require opening up network ports to allow inbound traffic from the SIEM servers|
## Operating PAWs
The PAW solution should be operated using the standards based on clean source principles.
