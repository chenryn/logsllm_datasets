3 MULTI-FACETED AND MULTI-PHASED
DEPLOYMENT
As explained in Section 1, given that different IoT devices have
different specifications and configurations, each honeypot needs to
be designed and configured in a unique way. Thus we adopted a
multi-faceted approach to building the various honeypot instances.
We also employ a multi-phased approach, where deployed honey-
pots’ sophistication is gradually increased based on the observation
of collected data.
In the first phase, we simply deployed the honeypots and col-
lected data. In the second phase, we analyzed the captured data and
tried to understand what information cybercriminals were looking
for, to provide responses accordingly for the purpose of eliciting
further adversary behaviors. These two phases iterate until we
are satisfied with the insights gained. In the third phase, we used
all the information we learned previously and deployed more ad-
vanced honeypots. This multi-phased investigation dovetails with
our multi-faceted honeypot approach. We have so far designed
three facets in our ecosystem. We both used off-the-shelf honey-
pot emulators and adapted them, and built specific emulators from
scratch. The first facet we designed was HoneyShell. We utilize off-
the-shelf Cowrie honeypots to emulate vulnerable IoT devices with
open ssh (port 22) or telnet (port 23). In each phase, we gradually
increased the sophistication of login credentials by analyzing pre-
vious phases’ logs. By doing so, we were able to obtain increased
sophistication and volume of commands executed in our honeypots.
This provided us more insights into attackers compared to simply
deploying a honeypot without adapting it, at the same time avoided
wasting engineering effort in creating a more realistic emulation
if the engineered features ended up not being explored by any
attackers. HoneyWindowsBox was the second facet we deployed
in our ecosystem to emulate IoT devices based on the Windows
platform. Dionaea and KFSensor were chosen for this purpose. For
our third facet, we developed a more specific honeypot from scratch
to emulate behaviors of an IoT camera device. First, we developed
ProxyPot (Figure 3), a proxy instance that sits between an IoT de-
vice and the network gateway and captures all traffic that goes
between. Based on the insights gained through the ProxyPot data,
we built a honeypot for IoT camera and coined it HoneyCamera
(Figure 2). Honeycamera is a low-interaction honeypot for D-Link

IoT cameras. In Phase 1, three honeypots were deployed. Two of
them were used to emulate D-Link DCS-5020L and the other one
to imitate D-Link DCS-5030L camera. In Phase 2, based on the logs
captured in phase 1, multiple two-step attacks were designed for the
HoneyCamera. After that, we did see an attack that first exploited a
well-known vulnerability that we planted inside the HoneyCamera,
to read username and password. Then the same attacking IP logged
in through the Camera login page using the stolen credential. More
details on the HoneyCamera can be found in the accompanying
technical report [8].
4 RELATED WORK
Luo et al. [9] designed an “intelligent-interaction” honeypot for
IoT devices. It actively scanned other IoT devices around the world
and sent part of received attacks to them as a means to eliciting
legitimate responses. Such experiments need to be done with great
care and ethical concerns, to prevent those devices from becoming
unwitting victims. In our honeypot ecosystem, all attack traffic is
forwarded to devices under our possession. The ProxyPot allows
for controlled exposure of our own devices to attackers.
Wang et al. [10] presented a hybrid IoT honeypot framework
called IoTCMal. It included a low-interaction component with tel-
net/ssh service and high-interaction vulnerable IoT devices and
was used to collect and analyze malware samples. Feng et al. [11]
used a honeypot system consisting of both real devices and simu-
lated services in their IoTShield framework. The honeypot system
collected real-world attack traffic in about two months’ time and
the data was used to create attack signatures for automated protec-
tion. Vetterl et al. [12] used firmware images to emulate CPE/IoT
devices and ran them as honeypots. Moreover, there have been
a number of honeypot studies that utilized low-interaction and
high-interaction honeypots separately or together to study attacks
on IoT devices [13–18]. Compared to the prior works, our main
contribution is the design, implementation, and deployment of
a multi-phased multi-faceted honeypot ecosystem that addresses
the challenges of capturing useful attack data on IoT devices, and
studies adversaries’ behaviors as they evolve.
5 CONCLUSION
In this work, we present a multi-faceted and multi-phased approach
to building an IoT honeypot ecosystem. An evolving honeypot
ecosystem can attract more interesting attacks that could yield

higher utility for research and operation, compared to one that is
built once and deployed for a short period of time (e.g., a couple of
months). In particular, our approach seems to be uniquely capable of
capturing human attack activities, as opposed to simply automated
attack scripts.
