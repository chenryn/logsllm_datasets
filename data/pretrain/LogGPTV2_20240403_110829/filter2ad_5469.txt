## Abstract
This study explores user perceptions of security and privacy in group chat applications, focusing on users in the US and UK. We conducted a 44-question survey with 1001 participants to understand their experiences, concerns, and preferences. Our findings highlight the need for improved security and privacy features in group chat tools, as well as the importance of considering cultural differences and infrequent users.

## Motivation
- **Importance of Secure Messaging:** Secure messaging is essential in modern society, with platforms like WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and WeChat boasting over 3 billion users.
- **Prior Research:** Previous studies have examined one-to-one secure chat, revealing significant security and usability issues.
- **Objective:** We aimed to investigate whether similar issues exist in group chat and to identify potential improvements for existing tools.

## Research Goals
1. Understand users' security and privacy perceptions regarding group chat.
2. Identify potential improvements to existing tools to better meet users’ needs.
3. Examine whether cultural differences impact users’ perceptions and requirements for group chat.

## Methodology
- **Survey Design:** A 44-question survey was developed, exploring tool usage, group dynamics, privacy, and security.
- **Enhancements:** The survey was refined through 10 cognitive interviews and feedback from researchers and an IRB consultant.
- **Participants:** 1001 participants from the UK and US were surveyed.
- **Data Validity:** 5 respondents were excluded due to incomplete or irrelevant responses, leaving 996 valid responses.

## Analysis
- **Coding:** Open-ended questions were pair-coded by two researchers.
- **Team Review:** Results were discussed as a team to identify key themes.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Data was analyzed to find correlations between answers.

## Demographics
- **Gender:** 58% female
- **Age:** 62% under 34
- **Education:** 58% completed education beyond high school
- **Usage Frequency:** 16% used group chat tools rarely, indicating a need to consider infrequent users in design.

## Limitations
- **Self-Reporting Bias:** Users may have misrepresented their attitudes or behaviors. Future work should use diary studies, interviews, and direct observation to validate results.
- **Cultural Scope:** The study focused on the US and UK. Future research should broaden this analysis to include other regions.

## Results

### Tool Usage
- **Tools Used:** Various group chat applications.
- **Reasons for Adoption:** Convenience, familiarity, and social network influence.

### Group Chat Topics
- **Topics Discussed:** Personal, professional, and social topics.
- **Uncomfortable Topics:** Sensitive discussions that made users feel uncomfortable.

### Likes and Dislikes
- **Likes:** Ease of communication, multimedia support, and real-time interaction.
- **Dislikes:** Lack of privacy, security concerns, and spam.

### Privacy Concerns
- **Example Quotes:**
  - "I have been involved in anime fanfiction circles and was fearful of my writing being associated with my real name/identity." (R803)
  - "A member of a Discord was screenshotting sensitive discussions and sharing them on social media." (R735)
  - "Things I might have said to my friends (secrets) regarding home issues." (R584)

### Perceptions of Security
- **Confidentiality:** Users equate security with confidentiality, ensuring that messages and group member lists are protected.
  - "If it is secure, there is no way that someone outside can access the messages being sent or the list of group members without the permission of a group admin." (R535)
- **Popularity and Reputation:** Users trust popular and well-reviewed tools, often relying on recommendations from friends and family.
  - "If there are a lot of positive reviews from users of the instant messaging tool, it leads me to believe that it is secure for group communications. In addition, I look for what my friends and family use because I trust their opinions in what is safe." (R719)

### Security Strategies
- **Group Management:**
  - "In some groups, the members share private and sensitive information. It’s important to get permission for the whole group before adding new members so the atmosphere of security can be maintained." (R283)
  - "I don’t feel that I can control them but I do take into account who is a member of the group and what I feel comfortable sharing with them." (R288)
- **Self-Filtering:**
  - "I realize that I can’t trust that my communication is 100% secure at this point, so I am just careful in what I say. Especially with the way the creators of internet apps, social media platforms, etc., are constantly breaching or violating the privacy of users and selling information." (R271)
  - "I never say anything I couldn’t say in front of my grandmother." (R155)
- **Establishing Identity:**
  - "I didn’t know the person and so I felt uncomfortable that they could be anyone - and I wasn’t quite sure how they were invited to the group chat in the first place." (R218)
  - "If you know the person in real life then you could ask them questions that only that person would know. Also, if you have another way of contacting the person, you could contact them and ask them to verify that it is in fact them." (R625)

### Dimensions of Privacy (Mulligan et al.)
- **Provision:** Respondents relied on themselves rather than their tools to protect their privacy.
- **Harm:** Respondents were mainly concerned about untrustworthy users or association, with fewer concerns about government surveillance.
- **Scope:** Respondents wanted their group chat data to remain private to their group indefinitely.

### Similarities Between the US and UK
- **Definitions:** Respondents in both countries defined privacy and security in group chat similarly.
- **Broader Views:** This does not imply that their broader views on security and privacy are identical.

## Discussion

### Snapshot of Main Findings
1. **User Strategies:** Users rely on self-filtering and careful group management to protect themselves.
2. **Primary Concerns:** The biggest concerns are untrusted group members or third parties reading private messages.
3. **Identity Verification:** Users want to know who they are talking to but also occasionally need pseudo-anonymous communication.

### Bridging the Gap: How Group Chat Fails Users
- **Missing Functionality:**
  - Methods for managing group membership.
  - Methods for intelligently filtering what you share.
- **Parity of Functionality:**
  - Blocking a user in one-to-one chat does not block them in group chat (e.g., WhatsApp, GroupMe, Facebook Messenger).
  - Default end-to-end encryption for one-to-one, but not group chat (e.g., Snapchat).
  - Key verification is more burdensome in group contexts.

### Identifying Sensitive Information for Users
- **Notification System:** Use keywords to notify users before they share potentially sensitive information.
- **User Control:** Users could mark which group chats the tool should monitor.
- **Local Storage:** Data from this textual analysis should be stored locally to protect privacy.
- **Further Research:** More research is needed to help users avoid sharing sensitive information in the wrong contexts.

### Group Management
- **New Member Notifications:** Persistent notifications or annotations can help users notice when new members are added.
- **Trust Establishment:** Annotations based on a web-of-trust model may be effective, given the closed and instantaneous nature of group chat communication.
