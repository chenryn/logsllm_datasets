User Perceptions of Security 
and Privacy for Group Chat

Motivation
•Secure messaging is integral to modern society
• 3 billion WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and WeChat users
•Prior work has examined one-to-one secure chat,
identifying substantial security and usability concerns
•We wanted to see if there were similar issues for group chat
2
Research Goals
1. Understand users' security and privacy perceptions 
2.
regarding group chat
Identify potential improvements that could be made to 
existing tools to make them better meet users’ needs
3. Understand whether cultural differences impact users’ 
perceptions and requirements for group chat

Methodology

Methodology
•44-question survey
• Explored tool usage, group dynamics, privacy, and security
• Survey was enhanced via 10 cognitive interviews, as well as 
feedback from researchers and our IRB consultant 
•1001 participants in the UK and US
• Known differences in privacy attitudes between US and Europe
• 5 respondents excluded due to a mostly blank survey or responses 
that did not answer the questions
• 996 valid responses
5
Analysis
•Pair-coding of open-ended questions by two researchers
•Discussed results as a team to identify themes in the data
•Analyzed data to find correlations between answers
6
Demographics
•58% female
•62% under 34
•58% completed education beyond high school
•16% used group chat tools rarely
• This indicates there may be a need to consider infrequent users 
when designing security and privacy features in group chat
7
Limitations
•Users may have misrepresented their attitudes or behaviors. 
Future work should build on our results via diary studies, 
interviews, and/or direct observation.
•In examining cross-cultural differences, we focused on the 
US and UK. Future work should broaden this analysis.

Privacy Concerns
“I have been involved in anime 
fanfiction circles and was fearful of 
my writing being associated with 
my real name/identity.” (R803)
“A member of a discord was 
screenshotting sensitive discussions 
and sharing them on social media.” 
(R735)
“Things I might have said to my 
friends (secrets) regarding home 
issues.” (R584)
13
Perceptions of Security
Security = Confidentiality
“If it is secure there is no way that 
someone outside can access 
the messages being sent or the list 
of group members without 
the permission of a group 
admin.” (R535)
Popularity + Reputation
“If there are a lot of positive reviews 
from users of the instant messaging 
tool, it leads me to believe that it is 
secure for group communications. In 
addition, I look for what my friends and 
family use because I trust their opinions 
in what is safe. However, I 
understand that full security is unlikely 
and I must make efforts to maintain 
security in group chats.” (R719)
14
Security Strategies: Group Management
“In some groups, the members share private and sensitive 
information. In groups with this sort of trust, it’s important to 
get permission for the whole group before adding new 
members so the atmosphere of security can be maintained.” 
(R283)
“I don’t feel that I can control them but I do take into account 
who is a member of the group and what I feel comfortable 
sharing with them.” (R288)
“Dependent on the group members and my trust of 
them rather than technology.” (R802)
15
Security Strategies: Self-filtering
“I realize that I can’t trust that my communication is 100% 
secure at this point so I am just careful in what I say. Especially 
with the way the creators of internet apps, social media 
platforms etc. are constantly breaching or violating the privacy 
of users and selling information.” (R271)
“I never say anything I couldn’t say in front of my grandmother.” 
(R155)
16
Security Strategies: Establishing Identity
“I didn’t know the person and so I felt uncomfortable that 
they could be anyone - and I wasn’t quite sure how they were 
invited to the group chat in the first place.” (R218)
“If you know the person in real life then you could ask 
them questions that only that person would know. Also if you 
have another way of contacting the person, you could contact 
them and ask them to verify that it is in fact them.” (R625)

Dimensions of Privacy (Mulligan et al.)
•Dimension of provision
• Respondents relied on themselves, rather than their tool, to protect 
their privacy
•Dimension of harm
• Respondents mainly concerned about untrustworthy users or 
association
• Only a few respondents concerned with government surveillance 
•Dimension of scope
• Respondents wanted their group chat data to remain private to 
their group indefinitely
18
Similarities Between the US and UK
•Respondents in the US and UK defined privacy and security 
in group chat similarly
•This result does not mean that their broader views on 
security and privacy are the same

Discussion
20
Snapshot of Main Findings
1. Users rely on self-filtering and careful group management 
to protect themselves
2. Users biggest concerns are that untrusted group members 
or third parties being able to read their private messages
3. Users want to know who they are talking to, but also 
occasionally need pseudo-anonymous communication

Bridging the Gap: How Group Chat Fails 
Users
•Missing Functionality
• Methods for managing group membership
• Methods for intelligently filtering what you share
•Parity of Functionality
• Blocking user in one-to-one chat does not block them in group chat 
(WhatsApp, GroupMe, Facebook Messenger)
• Default end-to-end encryption for one-to-one, but not group chat 
(Snapchat)
• Key verification more burdensome in group context
22
Bridging the Gap:
Identifying Sensitive Information for Users
•Use key words to notify users before they share potentially 
sensitive information
•Users could mark which group chats the tool should watch
•Data from this textual analysis would need to be stored 
locally to protect privacy
•More research needed to help users avoid sharing sensitive 
information in the wrong contexts
23
Bridging the Gap:
Group Management
•Easy to miss when a new member is added to the group (just 
a message in the group chat)
• Persistent notifications or annotations may help address
•Difficult to establish trust
• Annotations based on a web-of-trust model may prove effective 
because group chat communication is both closed and 
instantaneous
