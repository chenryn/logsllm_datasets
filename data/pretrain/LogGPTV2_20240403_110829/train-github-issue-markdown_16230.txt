### Describe the workflow you want to enable
I want to use a pipleine that includes
  * a feature selection step (like SelectKBest)
  * a HistGradientBoostingEstimator with monotonicity and/or categorical features
The problem is that specifying the features for this requires indices or a
boolean mask, but the feature selection means the mask/indices will be off.
You can do this with a custom class/FunctionTransformer, and you can do it
without a pipeline, but it would be nicer to have it in a pipeline.
### Describe your proposed solution
Allow specifying categorical features or monotonicity constraints via feature
names.
### Describe alternatives you've considered, if relevant
  * A custom class
  * Not using a pipeline
