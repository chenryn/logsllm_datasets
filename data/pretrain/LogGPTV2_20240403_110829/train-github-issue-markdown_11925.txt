Upgrading from Material UI 0.19.4 to 0.20.0, I get this error in the dev
console
    Warning: Unknown event handler property `onLeftIconButtonTouchTap`. It will be ignored.
        in div (created by Paper)
        in Paper (created by AppBar)
        in AppBar (created by MainNavBar)
No code change was made for the past 8 months on that component, and it worked
before upgrading.
     } titleStyle={ titleStyle }
      onLeftIconButtonTouchTap={ (event) => this.toggleSidenav(true) }
      iconStyleLeft={ iconStyle }
      iconElementRight={ MenuElement ?  : null }
    />
I have searched for this issue, and I have found only related issues (e.g.
#7972, #4221, #4156, etc.) but none of it seem to be addressing this probable
breaking change, so...
  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
The event handler for `onLeftIconButtonTouchTap` is supposed to be called when
the icon is clicked.
## Current Behavior
The event handler for `onLeftIconButtonTouchTap` is not called, but
specifically ignored.
## Your Environment
Tech | Version  
---|---  
Material-UI | 0.20.0  
React | 16.2.0  
browser | Google Chrome (latest)  
Meteor | 1.6.0.1  
**Note:** I am well aware of the v1 branch, but since it is in beta, and I
have no time right now to deal with this rather important migration, the 0.x
branch needs to be supported. Projects can't always be expected to follow edge
dependencies.
