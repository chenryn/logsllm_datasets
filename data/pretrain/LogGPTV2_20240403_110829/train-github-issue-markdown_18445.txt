Referring to #10611, my issue just got closed without being solved. One admin
just 'assuming' something and then the thread gets closed? Great.
So back on this, the issue still remains. My content shifts a little when
theres less than 4 thumbnails. Everything moves about 2cm when there's less
than 4 thumbnails.
I wrapped everything in a container, and we are not talking of a scrollbar. I
did try to use a clearfix after every 4 thumbnails (4 x 3col = 12col) and that
didn't work either.
Please don't just close this like you did last time.
