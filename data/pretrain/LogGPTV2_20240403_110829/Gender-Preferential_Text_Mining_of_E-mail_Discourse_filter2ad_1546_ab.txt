fore paramount.
The corpus of e-mail documents used in the experimen-
tal evaluation of the gender author categorisation study was
sourced from the inbox of a member of a large (greater than
15,000 users) academic organisation1. The senders of the e-
mail messages were selected based on the fact that they be-
longed to the organisation and their gender easily checked.
All other senders (external) were not considered as it was
not possible to conﬁrm their gender reliably. Any cross-
postings, re-quoted spammed e-mails (e.g., jokes, stories),
general notiﬁcation or broadcast e-mails relating to the or-
ganisation etc. were purged from the corpus. An initial
total of 8820 e-mail documents sourced from 342 authors
(approx. equally distributed between the two genders) were
selected. The gender of each author was conﬁrmed for all
e-mail documents. This document set was subsequently
pared down to 4369 e-mail messages (for 325 authors) to
ensure only email messages with a minimum number of
words equal to 50 are used (see [10] for suggested guide-
lines on the choice of e-mail document size). The body
of each e-mail document was then parsed using an e-mail
grammar, and the relevant e-mail body features were ex-
tracted. The body was pre-processed to remove (if present)
any salutations, reply text and signatures. However, the ex-
istence, position within the e-mail body and type of some of
these were retained as inputs to the categoriser (see below).

of the DSTO) that were involved in the experiment were only presented
with the summary statistics of the experiment and not with the contents of
the e-mails in the corpus.

Attachments were excluded, though the e-mail body itself
was used.
In order to study the impact of the number of words in an
e-mail on the categorisation performance (see later), the e-
mail corpus was further divided into multiple subsets. The
subsets were generated by ﬁrst creating a root-level subset
with a minimum number of 50 words per e-mail, and then
recursively generating lower-level subsets from their parent
subsets with a minimum of 100, 150, 200 etc. words per
e-mail. A summary of some of the e-mail document corpus
statistics measured in terms of the number of authors in each
gender cohort and the number of e-mails as a function of the
minimum number of words per e-mail, is shown in Table 1.
5.2. Attribute Selection
The attributes/features selected for the experiment were
members of two sets namely, a baseline set and a gender-
speciﬁc set. The total number of attributes used in the ex-
periment was 222.
A baseline set of attributes/features that was iden-
tiﬁed in previous authorship attribution experiments
(see [10][17][11]) for e-mail authorship discrimination was
extracted from each e-mail body document. These attributes
included both a mix of character- and word-based style
markers as well as structural features. A total of 211 base-
line attributes, comprising 183 style marker attributes and
28 structural attributes, were employed in the experiment
(see Table 2). Note that M = total number of tokens (i.e.,
words), V = total number of types (i.e., distinct words),
C = total number of characters, and H = total number of
HTML tags in the e-mail body. Also, attribute A21 is the
total number of characters in words, including apostrophes
and hyphens, divided by C. The hapax legomena count is
deﬁned as the number of types that occur only once in the
e-mail text. Attributes A8 to A20 are deﬁned in Tweedie
et al [7]. For example, Rubet’s K value is computed as
log(V )/log(M).
We brieﬂy clarify how we derive some of the attributes
shown in Table 2. Firstly, the set of short words in each e-
mail document consists of all words of length less than or
equal to 3 characters (e.g., “all”, “at”, “his” etc.). Only the
total count of short words is used as a feature. The short
word frequency distribution may be biased towards e-mail
content and was therefore not used in our experiments. Sec-
ondly, the set of all-purpose function words (“a”, “about”,
“after”, “all”, “also”, . . . , “yet”, “you”, “your”, “yours”)
and its frequency distribution is obtained and also used as
a sub-vector attribute. The number of function words used
is 122. Finally, a word length frequency distribution con-
sisting of 30 features (up to a maximum word length of 30
characters) is employed.
The re-quoted text position refers to the reply status of e-
mail. A reply text can generally be placed in any position in
the e-mail document and each line is usually preﬁxed with a
special character (e.g., “>”). In our experiment, the position
of re-quoted text allowed for 6 different possibilities (e-mail
body text interspersed with the re-quoted text, e-mail body
text preceded by re-quoted text etc.). Due to some e-mailers
using HTML formatting, we include the set of HTML tags
as a structural metric. The frequency distribution of HTML
tags was included as one of the 28 structural attributes.
The set of basic gender-speciﬁc language attributes were
selected from the literature presented in Section 3. These
are listed in Table 3 (attributes A211 to A221). The selected
attributes attempt to measure the frequency of use of adjec-
tives, adverbs (mainly through the presence of sufﬁxes) and
apologies. This attribute set is a small subset of possible
gender-preferential language attributes listed in the litera-
ture.
Though our choice of attributes is speciﬁcally biased to-
wards features that have been shown to be able to effec-
tively discriminate between authors and, hopefully, between
author gender, rather than discriminating between topics,
some of the style marker attributes may have a combination
of author and content bias as, for example, hapax legomena
as deﬁned in attributes A6 and A7 in Table 2 (see [18]).
Each attribute Ai is also scaled as follows:
