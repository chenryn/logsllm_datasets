A Custom Skill Elements
We show the elements needed for a custom skill in Table 6.
B Utterance Distribution
We list the length distribution of the sample utterances. As
shown in the Figure 8, only 0.8% of them are longer than 15.
So we select 15 as the threshold of Sl.
Figure 8: The distribution of the length of utterances
C Constituency-based Parse Tree Samples
We show two samples in Figure 9.
(a)
(b)
Figure 9: Examples of constituency-based parse tree
D Examples of Virtual Users
We list the information of three virtual users in Table 10.
These three virtual users constitute the relationship of a father,
a mother and a son.
E Questions Cannot Be Handled
We show the questions which cannot be handled by SkillEx-
plorer in Table 7.
F The Skills in Amazon Market
We show the skill numbers of different categories in Table 8.

Invocation name

Intents
Sample utterances
Description
Only needed for custom skills and can be used for identifying desired skills. Mention-
ing an invocation name explicitly can wake up the speciﬁc skill straightforward.
To handle the structured JSON-format requests from Alexa, skill developers can
choose either an AWS Lambda cloud or a custom web service (only suiting custom
skills).
An intent represents an action that fulﬁlls a user’s spoken request. It can optionally
have parameters which ofﬁcially called slots.
A set of likely spoken phrases mapped to the intents to help Alexa deal with response,
which should include as many representative phrases as possible.
Example
“Plan My Trip” has the invocation
name “plan my trip”
AWS Lambda cloud
Intent “PlanMyTrip” with slot
“fromCity”, “toCity”, “travelDate”.
“i want to visit {toCity}” is mapped
to intent “PlanMyTrip”.
