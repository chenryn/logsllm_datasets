### Appendix

#### A. Custom Skill Elements
Table 6 outlines the essential elements required for creating a custom skill.

| Element | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Invocation Name | Used to identify and wake up the specific skill. | "Plan My Trip" has the invocation name "plan my trip". |
| Cloud-Based Service | Handles structured JSON-format requests from Alexa. | AWS Lambda cloud or custom web service. |
| Intents | Represent actions that fulfill user requests, optionally with parameters (slots). | Intent "PlanMyTrip" with slots "fromCity", "toCity", "travelDate". |
| Sample Utterances | Likely spoken phrases mapped to intents to help Alexa respond. | "i want to visit {toCity}" is mapped to intent "PlanMyTrip". |

#### B. Utterance Distribution
Figure 8 shows the length distribution of sample utterances, indicating that only 0.8% are longer than 15 words. Thus, we set the threshold \( S_l \) at 15 words.

#### C. Constituency-Based Parse Tree Samples
Figure 9 provides two examples of constituency-based parse trees.

#### D. Examples of Virtual Users
Table 10 lists the information of three virtual users, representing a family relationship (father, mother, and son).
