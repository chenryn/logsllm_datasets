User: How to design a high-availability database architecture, including master-slave replication, read-write separation, cross-region disaster recovery, etc.?
Assistant: 1. Master-slave replication: Synchronously replicate the data of the master database to multiple slave databases. The master database is responsible for writing data, and the slave database is only responsible for reading, which can reduce the pressure on the master database. At the same time, when the master library fails, the slave library can automatically take over to achieve high availability. 2. Read-write separation: route read operations and write operations to different database nodes, and read operations can be load-balanced through multiple slave libraries to improve database performance and availability. Write operations are only performed on the main library to ensure data consistency. 3. Cross-regional disaster recovery: Deploy database nodes in multiple geographical locations, and realize disaster recovery backup through backup, cross-regional storage, and other means. When the main library fails, it can be quickly switched to the backup node to avoid data loss and business interruption. 4. Database cluster: In a cluster composed of multiple nodes, high availability can be achieved through technologies such as load balancing and automatic failover. When a node fails, the access traffic is automatically switched to other nodes to ensure the normal operation of the system. At the same time, the cluster can also increase the processing power and storage capacity of the database to meet the growing business needs. 5. Database cache: By adding a cache layer, the burden on the database can be reduced, and the performance and availability of the system can be improved. The cache can store hot spots of data, and the cache layer can handle higher concurrent access, reduce the pressure on the database, and also reduce the delay of the database.
