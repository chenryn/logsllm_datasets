I created a form without labels and tried to use the optional
success/warning/error icons and noticed that they were not positioned
correctly:
http://jsfiddle.net/9DSQZ/
It seems as though the positioning of these is determined by a label of 25px
height being above the form input.
    .has-feedback .form-control-feedback {
    position: absolute;
    top: 25px;
    ...
    }
This means if we style, move or hide form labels, the icon positioning needs
to be adjusted.
