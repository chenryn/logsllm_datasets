vided mechanisms to construct graphs with speciﬁed degree
distributions [36] and has characterized the size of the large
connected component [37].
Power-law networks are networks where the probability
that a node has degree k is proportional to k−γ , for large k
and γ > 1. The parameter γ is called the power-law coef-
ﬁcient. Researchers have shown that many real-world net-
works are power-law networks, including Internet topolo-
gies [16], the Web [9, 27], social networks [3], neural net-
works [11], and power grids [45].
Scale-free networks are a class of power-law networks where
the high-degree nodes tend to be connected to other high-

degree nodes. Scale-free graphs are discussed in detail by Li
et al. [31], and they propose a metric to measure the scale-
freeness of graphs. Expectedly, the social networks we study
display power-law distributions; by Li’s measure, these net-
works show scale-free properties as well.
Small-world networks have a small diameter and exhibit
high clustering. Studies have shown that the Web [5,12], sci-
entiﬁc collaboration on research papers [41], ﬁlm actors [6],
and general social networks [3] have small-world properties.
Kleinberg [23] proposes a model to explain the small-world
phenomenon in oﬄine social networks, and also examines
navigability in these networks [22]. The online social net-
works examined in this paper have small-world properties
much like their oﬄine counterparts.
4. MEASUREMENT METHODOLOGY
We now describe the data presented in this paper and the
methodology we used to collect it. We were not able to ob-
tain data directly from the respective site operators. Most
sites are hesitant to provide even anonymized data, and sign-
ing non-disclosure agreements to obtain data from multiple
competing sites may not be feasible or desirable. Instead,
we chose to crawl the user graphs by accessing the public
web interface provided by the sites. This methodology gives
us access to large data sets from multiple sites.
Since the focus of this paper is to investigate the struc-
ture of online social networks, we focus on the large weakly
connected component (WCC) of the corresponding graphs
in the rest of this paper. As we show later in this section,
the large WCC is structurally the most “interesting” part
of the network. The nodes not included in the WCC tend
to be either part of very small, isolated clusters or are not
connected to other users at all.
4.1 Challenges in crawling large graphs
Crawling large, complex graphs presents unique challenges.
In this section, we describe our general approach before dis-
cussing the details of how we crawled each network.
4.1.1 Crawling the entire connected component
The primary challenge in crawling large graphs is covering
the entire connected component. At each step, one can gen-
erally only obtain the set of links into or out of a speciﬁed
node.
In the case of online social networks, crawling the
graph eﬃciently is important since the graphs are large and
highly dynamic. Common algorithms for crawling graphs
include breadth-ﬁrst search (BFS) and depth-ﬁrst search.
Often, crawling an entire connected component is not fea-
sible, and one must resort to using samples of the graph.
Crawling only a subset of a graph by ending a BFS early
(called the snowball method) is known to produce a biased
sample of nodes [29]. In particular, partial BFS crawls are
likely to overestimate node degree and underestimate the
level of symmetry [10]. In social network graphs, collecting
samples via the snowball method has been shown to un-
derestimate the power-law coeﬃcient, but to more closely
match other metrics, including the overall clustering coeﬃ-
cient [29].
Some previous studies of social networks have used small
graph samples. Example studies have used samples of 0.3%
of Orkut users [4], less than 1% of LiveJournal communi-
ties [8], and 0.08% of MySpace users [4]. In this paper, we
obtain and study much larger samples of the user graphs.

4.1.2 Using only forward links
Crawling directed graphs, as opposed to undirected graphs,
presents additional challenges. In particular, many graphs
can only be crawled by following links in the forward direc-
tion (i.e., one cannot easily determine the set of nodes which
point into a given node). Using only forward links does not
necessarily crawl an entire WCC; instead, it explores the
connected component reachable from the set of seed users.
This limitation is typical for studies that crawl online net-
works, including measurement studies of the Web [12].

types. If only forward links are used, we can reach
only the inner cloud (shaded cloud); using both
forward and reverse links crawls the entire WCC
(dashed cloud).
Figure 1 shows an example of a directed graph crawl. The
users reached by following only forward links are shown in
the shaded cloud, and those reached using both forward and
reverse links are shown in the dashed cloud. Using both for-
ward and reverse links allows us to crawl the entire WCC,
while using only forward links results in a subset of the
WCC.
4.2 Crawling social networks
We now discuss our methodology for crawling each of the
networks we crawled, its limitations, and high-level statistics
of the resulting data sets. Using automated scripts on a clus-
ter of 58 machines, we crawled the social network graphs of
Flickr, LiveJournal, Orkut, and YouTube. High-level statis-
tics of the resulting data sets are presented in Table 1.
We chose these four sites because they are among the most
popular social networking sites and they allow us to view
the links out of any user in the network. In each step of our
crawls, we retrieved the list of friends for a user we had not
yet visited and added the retrieved users to the list of users
to visit. We continued until we exhausted the list. This
corresponds to a BFS of the social network graphs.
4.2.1 Flickr
Flickr (www.flickr.com) is a photo-sharing site based on
a social network. The Flickr data presented in this paper
is from a crawl of the large WCC conducted on January
9th, 2007, and contains over 1.8 million users and 22 million
links. Flickr exports an API for third-party developers, and
we used this API to conduct the crawl. We also obtained
group membership information via Flickr’s API.5
Flickr only allows us to query for forward links. Therefore
we were unable to crawl the entire large WCC. To estimate
the fraction of users who are part of the WCC but missing in
our crawl, we performed the following experiment. We used
the fact that the vast majority of Flickr user identiﬁers take
the form of [randomly selected 8 digit number]@N00. We
generated 100,000 random user identiﬁers of this form (from
a possible pool of 90 million) and found that 6,902 (6.90%)
of these were assigned usernames. These 6,902 nodes form
a random sample of Flickr users.
Among these 6,902 users, 1,859 users (26.9%) had been
discovered during our crawl. Focusing on the 5,043 users
not previously discovered by our crawl, we conducted a BFS
starting at each user to determine whether or not they could
reach our set of previously crawled users. We found that only
250 (5.0%) of the missed users could reach our crawled set
and were deﬁnitively in the WCC. While we cannot conclu-
sively say that the remaining 4,793 (95.0%) missed users are
not attached to the WCC (there could be some other user
who points to them and to the WCC), the fact that 89.7%
of these have no forward links suggests that many are not
connected at all.
Finally, to explore how the remaining missing nodes are
connected, we crawled the social network using these missing
users as seeds, and compared the results with our initial
crawl. We found only 11,468 new nodes that were not in
the connected component of 1.8 million nodes discovered
in the original crawl. Of these new nodes, 5,142 (44.8%)
were singleton nodes with no forward links, 3,370 (29.3%)
had one link, 620 (5.4%) had two or three links, and 2,336
(20.3%) had four or more links. Thus, the nodes missing
from our crawls tend to have low degree and are connected
only to small clusters that are not reachable from the large
connected component we crawled.
Thus, we believe that our crawl of the large WCC, al-
though not complete, covers a large fraction of the users
who are part of the WCC. Further, our experience with the
randomly generated Flickr user identiﬁers indicates that (at
least for Flickr), the nodes not in the largest WCC do not
form large subgraphs.
5Flickr allows users to form private groups, which do not
appear in the user’s proﬁle list. We were unable to determine
any information about the membership of such groups.
4.2.2 LiveJournal
LiveJournal (www.livejournal.com) is a popular blogging
site whose users form a social network. The LiveJournal
data set considered in this paper is the largest we examine:
it contains over 5.2 million users and 72 million links. Due
to its size, the LiveJournal crawl took several days, from
December 9-11, 2006. LiveJournal oﬀers an API that al-
lows us to query for both forward and reverse links. We
followed both link types to crawl the entire large WCC. We
also obtained group membership information via LiveJour-
nal’s API.6
To estimate the fraction of the LiveJournal network cov-
ered by our crawl, we used a feature of LiveJournal7 that
returns random users to select a list of 5,000 random Live-
Journal users. We then checked how many of these random
users our crawl had already covered. We found that we had
already crawled 4,773 (95.4%) of these users, showing that
our LiveJournal crawl covers the vast majority of the Live-
Journal population. Finally, we started another crawl from
the previously unknown 227 users to determine how many
additional users could be discovered. This technique found
only 73 additional users. These results suggest that our
LiveJournal crawl covers almost the entire LiveJournal user
population, and that the users not included in our crawl are
part of small, isolated clusters.
Using the entire WCC from LiveJournal, we calculated
the fraction of the WCC that is not reachable by using
only forward links (as we did for the Flickr and YouTube
crawls). We found that of the 5,284,457 nodes in the dis-
covered weakly connected component, only 404,134 (7.64%)
would have been missed had we followed only forward links.
Finally, we examined the 404,134 users who would have been
missed to see how well these users were connected. We found
that 201,694 (49.9%) of these users had a single forward link,
86,561 (21.1%) had two or three links, and 78,463 (19.4%)
of the users had four or more forward links. Since, as we will
show later, Flickr and YouTube share many characteristics
with LiveJournal, this result suggests that the users that are
missing in our Flickr and YouTube crawls tend to be small
in number and have relatively small outdegree.
4.2.3 Orkut
The next site we examined is Orkut (www.orkut.com), a so-
cial networking site run by Google. Orkut is a “pure” social
network, as the sole purpose of the site is social networking,
and no content is being shared. In Orkut, links are undi-
rected and link creation requires consent from the target.
Since, at the time of the crawl, new users had to be invited
by an existing user to join the system, the Orkut graph forms
a single SCC by deﬁnition.
The Orkut data considered in the paper was collected dur-
ing a crawl performed between October 3rd and November
11th, 2006. Because Orkut does not export an API, we had
to resort to HTML screen-scraping to conduct our crawl,
which requires more bandwidth. We obtained group infor-
mation in a similar manner. Furthermore, Orkut limits the
rate at which a single IP address can download information
and requires a logged-in account to browse the network. As
a result, it took more than a month to crawl a subset of
6We inferred groups in LiveJournal by crawling the interests
speciﬁed by users.
7http://www.livejournal.com/random.bml
3,072,441 users, at which point we stopped. This subset cor-
responds to 11.3% of Orkut’s user population of about 27
million users at the time of the crawl. The Orkut data con-
sidered in this paper, therefore, is limited to this connected
component and disregards all links from this component to
other, uncrawled users.
Because our Orkut data set contains only a sample of the
entire Orkut network, there are two potential concerns with
the representativeness of the data. The ﬁrst question is how
the 11.3% subset of the network we gathered would compare
to a diﬀerent 11.3% subset gathered in the same way.
In
other words, are the properties of our sample representative
of other samples of similar size? The second question is how
the properties of our sample compare to the properties of
the network as a whole.
To explore the ﬁrst of these concerns, we conducted ﬁve
separate, small crawls of Orkut starting from random lo-
cations. Our random starting locations were chosen using
Maximum-Degree random sampling [7] conﬁgured with a
path length of 100,000 hops. Each of the ﬁve crawls was
conﬁgured to cover 80,000 nodes in the same manner as our
single, large crawl. We then examined how similar the prop-
erties of the resulting samples were to each other.
We found that the properties of the ﬁve smaller crawls
were similar, even though these crawls covered only 0.26%
of the network. For example, we found that the clustering
coeﬃcient of these crawls had an average of 0.284 with a
standard deviation of 0.040. Similarly, we found that the
scale-free metric had an average of 0.550 with a standard
deviation of 0.083 (both of these metrics are discussed in
more detail in the following section). Thus, we believe that
the properties of our 11.3% sample of the network are likely
to be similar to other crawls of similar size that are done in
the same manner.
However, we caution the reader to be mindful of the sec-
ond concern when extrapolating the results from our crawl
to the entire Orkut network. Partial BFS crawls are known
to over-sample high-degree nodes, and under-sample low-
degree nodes [29]. This has been shown to overestimate the
average node degree and to underestimate the level of sym-
metry [10]. Thus, our results may not be representative of
the Orkut network as a whole.
4.2.4 YouTube
YouTube (www.youtube.com) is a popular video-sharing site
that includes a social network. The YouTube data we present
was obtained on January 15th, 2007 and consists of over
1.1 million users and 4.9 million links. Similar to Flickr,
YouTube exports an API, and we used this feature to con-
duct our crawls.
YouTube allows links to be queried only in the forward
direction, similar to Flickr. Unfortunately, YouTube’s user
identiﬁers do not follow a standard format,8 and we were
therefore unable to create a random sample of YouTube
users. Also, YouTube does not export group information
via the API. Instead, we obtained group membership infor-
mation by screen-scraping the HTML pages attached to user
proﬁles.
Because we were unable to crawl reverse links or estimate
the size of the user population in YouTube, we advise the
reader to be cautious in extrapolating the YouTube results
8YouTube’s user identiﬁers are user-speciﬁed strings.
to the entire YouTube population, as we do not know the
number of users who do not participate in the social network.
4.2.5 Summary
Our results indicate that
• The Flickr and YouTube data sets may not contain
some of the nodes in the large WCC, but this fraction
is likely to be very small.
• The LiveJournal data set covers almost the complete
population of LiveJournal, and contains the entire large
WCC.
• The Orkut data set represents a modest portion of the
network, and is subject to the sampling bias resulting
from a partial BFS crawl.
Moreover, the results also indicate that the vast majority
of missed nodes in Flickr, LiveJournal, and YouTube have
low degree and are likely to be part of small, isolated clus-
ters.
Based on the number of users published by the sites at
the time of the crawl, we estimate the fraction of nodes
our crawls cover as 1.8 million out of 6.8 million (26.9%)
for Flickr, 5.2 million of 5.5 million (95.4%) for LiveJour-
nal, and 3.0 million out of 27 million (11.3%) for Orkut.
Unfortunately, we do not know the number of accounts in
YouTube. Thus, we were unable to estimate the fraction of
the population that our 1.1 million crawled YouTube users
represent.
All of the data sets considered in this paper are available
to the research community. The data has been anonymized
in order to ensure the privacy of the social network users.

4.3 High-level statistics
Table 1 presents the high-level statistics of the data we gath-
ered. The crawled network sizes vary by almost a factor of
ﬁve (1.1 million users in YouTube vs. 5.2 million in Live-
Journal), and the number of links varies by almost two or-
ders of magnitude (4.9 million in YouTube versus 223 mil-
lion in Orkut). Similarly, other metrics such as the average
number of friend links per node and user participation in
shared interest groups also vary by two to three orders of
magnitude. Our analysis later will show that despite these
diﬀerences, these graphs share a surprisingly large number
of key structural properties.
4.4 Web graph analysis
The Web is one of the most well-studied online networks,
and our study shares much of its methodology with previ-
ous studies of the Web. It is natural to compare the struc-
ture of online social networks to the structure of the Web.
However, we are well aware that the user graph in social net-
works is fundamentally diﬀerent from the Web graph; our
comparisons serve more to provide a point of reference for
our results than to point out (expected) diﬀerences.
In order to compare the structure of online social net-
works with that of the Web, we cite previous studies of the
Web structure where possible. We also performed some of
our own analysis, using the data collected by the Stanford
WebBase Project [1] during their crawl of December 2003.
We selected 8.6 million pages and 132 million hyperlinks
collected from over 3,900 Web sites contained in the crawl.
5. ANALYSIS OF NETWORK STRUCTURE
In this section, we characterize the structural properties of
the four networks we measured. We compare the networks
to each other, and we compare their properties with those
previously observed for the Web.
