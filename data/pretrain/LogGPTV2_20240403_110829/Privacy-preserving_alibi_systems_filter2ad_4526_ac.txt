wishing to verify her alibi, simply contacts the alibi corrob-
orator to “ask” if he is willing to corroborate her alibi. The
owner can use an anonymous messaging system such as [13]
to contact the corroborator. Our scheme gives the corrob-
(pko, sko) and (pkc, skc), respectively. In our private cor-
roborator scheme, each corroborator also has her own pseu-
dorandom function prfc(·) with secret key. Both parties
have the rest of the capabilities as in the public corrobo-
rator scheme.
5.4 Alibi Creation
In this phase, the owner begins the exchange just as in the
public corroborator scheme. The owner creates her Owner-
Statement in the way described in Section 2, and sends the
OwnerStatement to the corroborator.
Upon receiving the OwnerStatement, the corroborator com-
putes his signature over the OwnerStatement and the con-
text in which it was received by the corroborator. However,
instead of sending this signature back to the alibi owner, the
corroborator commits to this data using the cryptographic
string commitment scheme.
To commit to the information needed to corroborate the
owner’s identity the corroborator selects a random value rc
and computes
j = (OwnerStatement, Contextc)
sc = M D(j, Signskc (j))
The corroborator commits to sc by computing
xc = prfc(rc)
yc = M D(xc)
and choosing a universal hash function hc(·) where
Figure 2: The private corroborator scheme
hc(xc) = sc
orator as much control over his privacy as the owner over
hers. Just as the alibi owner can freely ask corroborators to
create alibis without revealing her identity, the corroborator
can freely help owners to create their alibis without revealing
his identity. The alibi owner reveals her identity only when
she wishes to verify her alibi, and the corroborator reveals
his identity only when he helps the owner to verify her alibi.
We show the three phases of our private corroborator
scheme in Figure 2. Note that we have added a “corrob-
oration” phase, in which the owner asks the corroborator to
identify himself and corroborate the alibi. This means that
the owner must be able to contact the corroborator without
knowing his identity.
In our private corroborator scheme
we assume that the participants also have access to some
anonymous messaging system that provides this function-
ality, such as SMILE [13]. SMILE requires a trusted third
party, but only for message delivery. While misbehavior of
a third party in SMILE might prevent an alibi owner from
communicating with a corroborator (denial-of-service), this
third party can not compromise the privacy of the alibis in
our scheme.
If the corroborator agrees to corroborate the alibi, then
he returns the CorroboratingEvidence the owner needs to
claim her alibi. The owner claims her alibi by presenting
her OwnerStatement, the link to her OwnerFeatures, and
the CorroboratingEvidence to the judge.
5.3
Initialization
Just as in our public corroborator scheme, each alibi owner
and alibi corroborator has their own public/private key pair
Combining these values gives the corroborator the EvidenceRe-
minder, which the corroborator sends to the alibi owner.
EvidenceReminder = (hc, yc, rc, Contextc)
In order to be able to claim their alibi later, the alibi owner
only needs to store the context used in the OwnerFeatures,
ho, xo, and the EvidenceReminder (hc, yc, rc, Contextc). The
alibi corroborator does not need to store any values (except
for their own private keys).
Note that the corroborator does not send his veriﬁcation
secret xc to the owner at this time. This value does not
need to be stored because the corroborator can use rc and
her pseudorandom function (keyed with her secret key) to
recompute xc in the corroboration phase.
Also in this phase the provider and corroborator must ex-
change whatever information necessary to allow the provider
to send a message to the corroborator anonymously if the
provider wishes to claim their alibi.
5.5 Alibi Corroboration
To claim their alibi, the owner contacts the corrobora-
tor (via some anonymous messaging system such as [13]) to
ask if they are willing to reveal their identity in association
with a speciﬁed context. If so, then the owner ﬁrst reveals
his identity to the corroborator by sending her veriﬁcation
secret xo and OwnerFeatures to the corroborator. The cor-
roborator checks the owner’s decommitment, and proceeds
if the decommitment is valid.
The owner sends the EvidenceReminder the corroborator
created in the creation phase back to the corroborator. Be-
cause the EvidenceReminder contains rc, the corroborator
!"#$%&’()($*$#(&+,-.$#/$&0$*-#.$%&+,-.$#/$&0$*-#.$%&12%%232%)4#5&+,-.$#/$&6&’$/%$(&12%%232%)4#5&+,-.$#/$&!"#$%&’(")*+%!,#$%&*’’*,*’")*+%!-#$%.(’/0-")*+%!"#"$"$"#"%"#"$"&"’"#"$"#"(")"*"$"!"#"$"$"#"%"#"$"&"’"#"$"#"(")"*"$"+","-"."*"#"(")"*"$"!"#$%&’()($*$#(&6&’$/%$(&!"#$%&’()($*$#(&6&’$/%$(&can recompute xc needed to decommit hc and yc. The cor-
roborator takes the OwnerStatement and context provided
by the owner and recomputes
j = (OwnerStatement, Contextc)
sc = M D(j, Signskc (j))
The corroborator checks to see if this sc value is the value
they committed to in the creation phase. That is, the corrob-
orator checks to see that the hc(xc) = sc and M D(xc) = yc.
If so, then the corroborator knows that they must have
created a signature over the OwnerStatement and in Contextc,
which they would only do if they received that OwnerState-
ment in an alibi creation exchange in that given context. So,
because the corroborator has decided to support the owner’s
alibi claim for this context, the corroborator returns the Cor-
roboratingEvidence including the signature in the same for-
mat as in the public corroborator scheme.
CorroboratingEvidence = (a, Signskc (a))
a = (ho, yo, Contextc)
The corroborator sends the CorraboratingEvidence to the
owner. In our private corroborator scheme, the corrobora-
tor also sends the xc value to the alibi owner along with the
CorraboratingEvidence. The alibi owner uses this to verify
the corroborator’s decommitment to the EvidenceReminder.
This allows the corroborator to demonstrate the link be-
tween the signature in the CorroboratingEvidence and the
EvidenceReminder the corroborator gave to the owner in
the creation phase. The owner can make sure that the sig-
nature received in the corroboration phase is the same as
corroborator’s signature made during the creation phase.
5.6 Alibi Veriﬁcation
Alibi veriﬁcation in the private corroborator scheme is
done in exactly the same way as in the public corrobora-
tor scheme. Just as before, the owner sends ho, yo, and
ro to the judge, along with the context as speciﬁed by the
corroborator, and the corroborator’s signature over these
values. The owner also decommits their OwnerStatement,
and reveals the OwnerFeatures. The judge checks the cor-
roborator’s signature, and the owners decommitment and
OwnerFeatures.
6. PROPERTIES OF THE PRIVATE COR-
ROBORATOR SCHEME
The private corroborator scheme shares all the properties
of the public corroborator scheme described in Section 4
(except that the corroborator learns the identity of the alibi
owner at the corroboration stage in the private corroborator
scheme, instead of at the veriﬁcation stage in the public
corroborator scheme). In this section we discuss additional
properties of the private corroborator scheme.
6.1 Privacy
Our scheme preserves the privacy of the alibi corroborator
in the following properties:
• No one, including a malicious alibi owner, can uncover
the identity of the alibi corroborator before the corrob-
orator creates the CorroboratingEvidence in the pro-
tocol.
• No one, including any number of collaborating mali-
cious alibi owners, can link multiple EvidenceReminders
created by the same corroborator.
• When a corroborator sends a CorroboratingEvidence
in reply to an EvidenceReminder sent by an alibi owner,
the corroborator reveals his identity. However, no one,
including any number of collaborating malicious alibi
owners, can link him to any of the evidence reminders
that he has created (in the creation stage) but not yet
used (in the corroboration stage).
These properties are guaranteed by the string commit-
ment scheme in our protocol.
6.2 Reciprocity
The private corroborator scheme raises the question of
reciprocity of privacy:
is it possible for one party to learn
the other party’s identity without revealing his own? A fair
exchange scheme (e.g. [15]) might allow us to achieve privacy
reciprocity but it requires a trusted third party, which our
threat model precludes.
We believe that privacy reciprocity is unnecessary for our
scheme. First, before the parties enter the corroboration
stage, neither party’s identity is revealed. Second, after
the parties enter corroboration, the owner reveals her iden-
tity before the corroborator does. Therefore, it is possible
that the corroborator learns the owner’s identity without re-
vealing his identity to the owner, but only when the owner
chooses to reveal her identity to get a corroborated alibi from
the corroborator. Just as in the physical world, a defendant
cannot remain anonymous while asking a witness to testify
for her, and has to bear the risk that the witness may decline
to come forward after she reveals her identity.
Note that a malicious corroborator cannot force an alibi
owner to reveal herself, as the owner must initiate the cor-
roboration stage.
7. COMPARISON TO PHYSICAL ALIBIS
We call alibis used in current legal systems physical ali-
bis. A physical alibi includes the corroborator, the owner
(a.k.a. the beneﬁciary), and the context, which includes the
means by which the corroborator identiﬁes the owner. For
example, in the case a personal witness, the corroborator is
a person and the means is via physical senses such as vision;
in the case of a physical evidence, the corroborator is the
entity that issues the physical evidence (e.g., a subway sta-
tion), and the means is the physical evidence (e.g., a subway
ticket).
We discuss some comparisons between our alibis and phys-
ical alibis. The unique properties of our alibis give partici-
pants several advantages over physical alibis, including:
• They better protect the privacy of the alibi owner (and
corroborator in our private-corroborator scheme)
• They have non-forgeability properties beyond that of
many physical alibis
• They embed the identities of the participants directly
and unambiguously into the alibis
• They help prevent alibis from being forgotten or faded
over time
7.1 Common Properties
Trustworthiness of Corroborator.
The strength of a physical alibi depends on the reliabil-
ity of the evidence and the trustworthiness of the corrob-
orator. The same applies to our alibis. For example, our
scheme cannot prevent a collaborating owner and corrobo-
rator from creating a fake but valid alibi (a.k.a. perjury).
Just like physical alibis, our alibis leave the determination
of the trustworthiness of the alibis to the judges.
Privacy of Corroborator.
The corroborator of a physical alibi may wish to protect
his privacy by remaining anonymous. In this case, the alibi
becomes useless because no one can judge the trustworthi-
ness of the corroborator.
In our public scheme (Section 2, the identity of the corrob-
orator is public. However, in our private scheme (Section 5),
the corroborator may remain anonymous by refusing to cor-
roborate the CorroboratingEvidence that he created earlier.
7.2 Beneﬁts
7.2.1 Privacy
Consent on Alibi Creation.
In physical alibi settings, alibis may be created for a per-
son without her consent. For example, without a person’s
content, she may be remembered by a doorman, or her pho-
tos may be taken by a camera. By contrast, our scheme
requires the owner to initiate alibi creation.
Consent on Alibi Veriﬁcation.
Although alibis often beneﬁt the owners, they may harm
the owners as well, e.g., when they are used as evidence
by the prosecutors. Therefore, the owner has to decide in
advance whether she wants her physical alibi to be created (if
she does not, then she may disguise herself or avoid contact
with the corroborator). Since she may not know in advance
whether her alibi may be beneﬁcial or harmful, she faces a
dilemma:
if she chooses to have her alibi created, it may
harm her in the future; however, if she chooses not to have
her alibi created, she may lose important alibis that could
prove her innocent in the future. The cause of her dilemma
is that other people can verify her physical alibis without
her consent.
By contrast, an alibi in our scheme is unveriﬁable unless its
owner consents (by providing the veriﬁcation secret). This
removes the dilemma that the owners face when creating
physical alibis. In our scheme, the owners can freely create
alibis. Later, she can decide to verify only the alibis that
are beneﬁcial to her.
7.2.2 Reliability
Accuracy.
There are a number of problems with physical alibis where
one person is the corroborator for another. The corrobora-
tor may misremember the identity of the alibi owner (e.g.,
Charlie thinks that he saw Bob when he actually saw Alice),
the context (e.g., Charlie thinks that he saw Alice on Mon-
day when he actually saw Alice on Tuesday), or the link
