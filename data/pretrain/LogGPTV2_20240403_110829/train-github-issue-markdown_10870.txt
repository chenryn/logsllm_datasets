##### Description of the problem
UUID generation in Math.js produces strings stored as concatenated strings in
Firefox and Chrome.
On Chrome 40bytes are used for each component of the final string, creating
heap overhead. In my application with thousands of objects this adds up.
For example, Heap size using Chrome
r89 as is: 95MB  
r89 with uuid flattened with String().toUpper(): 66MB.
I see similar results using Firefox.
