to a group of competiting firms. In other words, service S is a competitor if
c
customers value service S less when they have access to service S than when
i c
they have service S alone.

For example, the SaaS SugarCRM has several competitors including Sales-

of SugarCRM. Sage ERP and Sugar ERP Business Suite are complementors of
SugarCRM. The SugarCRM service is a customer of Oracle and IBM since it
relies on Oracle 11g or IBM DB2 database support services.
3.2 Interconnection Level
It is fundamental that a service system relates its activities, its actors, and its
resources to those of other firms’ services to streamline integration. Only the
consideration of various levels can led to a sound integration of service system
layers into networks. H˚akansson and Snehota [15] showed that relationships can
perform a variety of actions through:
1. Activity links,
2. Actor bonds, and
3. Resource ties.
This classification is captured by the concept Level which is associated
with the concept Relationship. An activity link (modeled with the concept
ActivityLink) refers to the integration of activities, tasks, or operations exe-
cuted under the control of two service systems. Many arguments for closely in-
tegrating activities between manufacturers, suppliers, and customers originated
fromthefieldsofbusinessprocessmanagementandbusinessprocessreengineer-
ing.Inotherwords,thisconceptmakesitpossibletocreatecross-organizational
workflows and business processes underlying a service network.
Actor bonds (modeled with the concept ActorBond) refer to the interaction
among participants belonging to the human resource structure of distinct ser-
vices. The objective of this concept is to enable the analysis and reasoning on
social enterprise networks.
Resourceties(modeledwiththeconceptResourceTie)refertotheexchange
of resources types. According to the resource-based view [21], service systems
can differentiate themselves and increase their competitiveness by using hetero-
geneous, immobile, valuable, rare, inimitable, and non-substitutable resources.
The concept of resource ties is aligned with the concept of value exchanged
Modeling Service Relationships for Service Networks 7
within companies in e3value [22]. For example, the Progress Apama SaaS for
complexeventprocessingforcapitalmarketsestablishesresourcetiesintheform
of events with the stock exchange market service. This latter service executes
trading operations and continuously sends events to Progress Apama.
ThesethreelevelsofintegrationcanbenefitfromextendingtheOSSRmodel
by referencing Linked Data concepts to provide more information on the activi-
ties, actors, and resources exchanged among two service systems. For example,
references using URI can be made to the type of resources being exchanged: ’US
dollars’ or ’BMW part nr. 11127790052’.
3.3 Involvement Strength

nership while lower levels of involvement suggest that both parties choose for a
more simplified relationship. The concept can take two forms:

these two service systems can be classified as low- or high-involvement depend-
ing on the number of customized business applications made by Epicom for
SugarCRM, and the number of customers and users the customizations have.
3.4 Functional Comparison
Comparison consists in the identification of similarities and differences between
service systems. A service system can be described by the functionalities and
characteristics it provides (i.e. activities, operations, functions, options, etc.).
Let us consider that the set of functionalities and characteristics provided by a
service is represented by fc(S ). When comparing two service systems, we can
i
identify five possible comparison cases (the cases were derived from set theory
[17] and object-oriented programming [18]) expressing the degree of equivalence
between two services:
1. fc(S ) is equivalent to fc(S ), (fc(S )≡fc(S )),
i j i j
2. fc(S ) is a generalization of fc(S ), (fc(S )(cid:40)fc(S )),
i j i j
3. fc(S ) is a specialization of fc(S ), (fc(S )(cid:41)fc(S )),

fc(S )(cid:54)=fc(S )), and

5. fc(S ) is different from fc(S ), (fc(S )∩fc(S )∈∅).

ThesecasesarecapturedbytheconceptComparison.Comparingtwoservice

jectivity,especiallywhenservicesinvolvesociotechnicalsubsystems.Subjectivity
is an intrinsic aspect of the physical world. For example, the characteristics of
anobjectinthephysicalworlddependsonthedirectionfromwhichitisviewed.
Therefore, all observations of physical characteristics are relative to the frame
of reference of the observer, and the results reflect the state of observer.

than another. The value Specialization (partial equivalence) expresses that a
servicehasabroadersetoffunctionalitiesthantheotherone.Aspecialization
has the same semantics of the generalization relation but works in the opposite
direction.
For example, the SaaS SugarCRM provides four packages: professional, cor-
porate, enterprise, and ultimate. The base service is the same but the pack-
ages offer a different set of functionalities and characteristics. In other words,
there is a implicit containment hierarchy fc(S ) ⊂ fc(S ) ⊂
professional corporate
fc(S )⊂fc(S ).Theprofessionalservicehasallthefeaturesthat
enterprise ultimate
the corporate service has but does not include the option Sugar Mobile Plus;
and the ultimate service is the only service providing 250GB Sugar On-Demand
Storage. Therefore, the SugarCRM professional service is a generalization of
the corporate service and the ultimate service is a specialization of all the
others.
The value Similar (inexact equivalence) expresses that services are similar.
Some functionalities intersect while others are disjoint.

can take the form of an:

2. Composition.
Anassociationoftypeaggregationexpresses’apartof’or’hasa’relationship
between two service systems. One of the services has the role of assembly and
the other one has the role of component. The value AggregationBy indicates

that the service source has the role of assembly and the service target has the
roleofcomponent.ThevalueAggregationOfistheinverserelation.Itindicates
that the service source has the role of component and the target service has the
role of assembly. For example, an airline service is an aggregation of security,
check-in, catering, handling, and cleaning services. Another example from the
SaaS arena is the Internet self-service named IT Incident Management Service
(ITIMS) adapted from ITIL best practices and described in [23]. The service is
an aggregation which relies on three SaaS components to operate: the platform
provider Heroku.com, the database provider MongoDB.com, and the email gate-
wayproviderMcAfee.com.Inotherwords,ITIMSestablishesanAggregationBy
with three other SaaS which take the role of role of components.
A composition is a specialized form of strong aggregation where component
services cease to exist, or are not needed, if the assembly service ceases to exist.
The value CompositionBy is the inverse of value CompositionOf. It indicates
that the service source has the role of component and the target service has the
role of assembly.
3.6 Causality Between Services
ArelationshiphasalsoassociatedaCausalityconcept.Causalityorcause-effect
describehowacause eventoccurringinaservicesystemhasaneffect inanother

of service systems which are connected. KPIs are often associated with service
level(see*-USDL)andqualityofservice(QoS),andincludeparameterssuchas
availability, cost, downtime, errors, response rime, etc. For example, the Invoice

quantitative analysis of the propagation of changes or domino effect in a service
network.
The system dynamics or systems thinking approach [19] is used to capture
andenabletheposteriorianalysisofservicenetworks.Insteadoflookingatcauses
(captured with the concept Cause) and their effects (captured with the concept
Effect) in isolation, systems thinking enables to look at service networks as a
system made up of interacting parts. The concept Link connects a cause to and
sets the sign that a directed link can take: Positive or Negative. A positive
linkindicatesthatachange(increaseordecrease)inaserviceKPIresultsinthe
same type of change (increase or decrease) in another service KPI. A negative
linkindicatesthatachange(increaseordecrease)inaserviceKPIresultsinthe
opposite change (decrease or increase) in another service KPI.
Byusingtheconceptofcausalityitbecomespossibletoexpressandquantify
the impact that one service system has in other service systems. This capability
brings an important contribution to service networks. It enables to think about
a service network as a complex dynamic system to study how a service behav-
ior affects the provisioning of other services. Its application to global networks
10 Jorge Cardoso
will make it possible to discover new scientific insights on global digital service
economies.
Since KPIs are often domain dependent and their semantics may not always
be clear to analysts, individual measures of performance in a cause-effects rela-
tion are classified with a schema composed of five elements (c.f. [24]) captured
by the concept Category:
1. Quality,
2. Time,
3. Cost,
4. Flexibility, and
5. Other.
The use of this schema provides a level of abstraction which enables, for
example, a time-based analysis of service network. Since the meaning of the
elementsthatcomposetheschemaisintuitivetheywillnotbefurtherexplained.
4 Evaluation and Implementation
To evaluate the OSSR model from a user, expert, and ontology engineer point-
of-view, we have followed the frame of reference proposed in [25]. It consisted in
verifying several aspects of the model.
– Consistency. In this phase, we tried to identify possible design errors. We
did not find circular definitions; the model was syntactically correct; it was
validatedusingProt´eg´eandJena;severalinstancesofthemodelwerecreated;
no contradictory knowledge was detected; and all concepts were consistent
with the theoretical definitions of relationships.
– Completeness, expandability, and sensitiveness.Inasecondphase,wetriedto
locateconceptswhosemodelingwasincompletebyreexaminingtheliterature
onrelationships.WelookedattheOSSRmodelfromaholisticperspectiveand
we have identified that the causality concept required an additional element
toenablethedynamicanalysisofservicenetworks:thedirectionofthecause-
effectlink.Webelievethatthemodelisnotcompleteandadditionalrelations
types will be added in the future as the model is experimented in industrial
settings. The model is expandable since it is constructed based on the notion
of layers: new relations can be added without altering the set of well-defined
relations that are already guaranteed. The use of layers also make the model
relatively insensitive to small changes.
– Conciseness. We proved the conciseness of the model by asserting that it did
not contained redundant or unnecessary definitions. Redundancies could not
be inferred using other knowledge.
The OSSR model was considered to be valid from a conceptual and formal
point-of-view.
