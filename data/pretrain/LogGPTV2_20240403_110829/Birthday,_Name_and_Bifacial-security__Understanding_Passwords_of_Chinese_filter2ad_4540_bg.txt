### Markov-Chain-Based Attacks on Password Datasets

#### Introduction
This section discusses the results of Markov-chain-based attacks on different groups of password datasets. The analysis focuses on the effectiveness of these attacks under various conditions and provides insights into the strength of passwords across different platforms.

#### Methodology
- **Training Sets:**
  - **Attacks (a)–(c):** 1 million Duowan passwords.
  - **Attacks (d)–(f):** 1 million Rockyou passwords.
- **Scenarios:**
  - **Scenario #1:** Laplace Smoothing and End-Symbol Normalization.
  - **Scenarios #2–#5:** Similar cracking results with variations in smoothing and normalization techniques.

#### Results
- **Figure 6:**
  - **(a) Order-5 Markov Attack on Chinese Datasets**
  - **(b) Order-4 Markov Attack on Chinese Datasets**
  - **(c) Order-3 Markov Attack on Chinese Datasets**
  - **(d) Order-5 Markov Attack on English Datasets**
  - **(e) Order-4 Markov Attack on English Datasets**
  - **(f) Order-3 Markov Attack on English Datasets**

The reversal principle holds across all scenarios, indicating consistent cracking patterns.

#### Implications
##### For Password Creation Policies
- **CSDN Passwords:**
  - 2.18% of CSDN passwords are of length ≤7.
  - 97.82% of CSDN passwords are of length 8-20.
  - No CSDN password is of length ≥21.
  - This suggests that CSDN has enforced a strict password policy (8≤ len ≤20) at some point before the data breach in December 2011.

- **Dodonew Passwords:**
  - No apparent password policy can be inferred from the Dodonew data.
  - Figures 4 and 6 show that, given any guess number below \(10^7\), CSDN passwords are significantly weaker than Dodonew passwords.
  - A plausible reason is that users perceive Dodonew, which provides e-commerce services, as more important, leading them to choose more complex passwords.

- **CSDN Policy Changes:**
  - CSDN enforced the policy 6≤ len ≤20 in 2015.
  - Currently, CSDN requires passwords to meet certain complexity requirements.

#### Conclusion
The analysis highlights the importance of strong password policies and user behavior in creating secure passwords. E-commerce platforms, like Dodonew, tend to have stronger passwords due to their perceived importance, while technology forums, like CSDN, may have weaker passwords. Enforcing strict password policies and educating users about password security are crucial for enhancing overall security.
