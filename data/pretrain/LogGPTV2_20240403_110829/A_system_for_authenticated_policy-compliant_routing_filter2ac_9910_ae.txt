### 7.3 Replay Attacks
In the context of rate-based accounting, a simple model where resource principals can use a fixed, aggregate bandwidth is likely sufficient. However, while packet bindings cannot be forged (assuming cryptographic hardness assumptions hold), they can be replayed by an adversary who may wish to exhaust a resource principal’s limited bandwidth for a given capability. Since capabilities expire periodically, a natural countermeasure against replay attacks is to track packets that traverse a router within a specific time window and count each distinct packet only once. A Bloom filter can be used for this purpose, but it may fill up over time, leading to false positives. This issue can be mitigated by maintaining a small circular array of Bloom filters, which are cleared as they fill up [2, 32]. Although an adversary might log all packets and replay them after the corresponding Bloom filter is emptied, if the filters are cleared only at key expiration intervals, stored packets cannot be replayed.

### 7.4 Scalability
While our discussion so far has focused on the deployment of Platypus in limited settings, the system's potential scalability in real-world deployment is of significant interest. In this section, we address the scalability of our current design.

The careful selection of MAC algorithms is crucial for peak verification performance. We use UMAC in our software implementation, but anticipate that PMAC would be chosen for hardware implementations. While we do not have exact figures on its performance, PMAC's inherently parallelizable design makes it ideal for hardware implementation [8]. Hardware implementations of AES already achieve raw throughput of 48 Gbps [30], suggesting that high-speed PMAC computation is feasible. Since MAC computations rely on local information, capability issuers can choose a MAC algorithm appropriate for their forwarding hardware or software.

Platypus's double-MAC design requires constant state for capability verification, regardless of the number of resource principals. ISPs may, however, wish to maintain additional accounting state for billing purposes. In the extreme case of per-packet billing, an ISP would need to keep a packet counter for each resource principal. While deployments of Platypus in the core may only need to handle a few thousand resource principals (e.g., UUNet's 2,569 peers [34] may each represent a principal), deployments for a broadband ISP may involve many more (Comcast, for instance, currently has 5.7 million customers [21]). Recent work has shown that approximate counters with bounded error can be maintained per flow at very high speeds (OC-768) [19].

We argue that Platypus key management can also be scaled to support large numbers of resource principals. For key distribution, it is unlikely that all requests will arrive exactly at key ID-change boundaries, as Platypus does not require tight time synchronization between resource principals and routers. Even in such an unlikely event, Platypus key servers need only perform two MAC and one block-cipher call for each request; servicing ten million such requests in one second is well within the capacity of approximately 20 well-provisioned key servers. Furthermore, since key lookup requests and responses are small, each lookup requires only one packet receipt and transmission on the part of a key server.

### 7.5 Traffic Engineering
Conventional wisdom suggests that widespread source routing deployment would complicate traffic-engineering efforts. While there is some cause for concern, we remain optimistic. Recent simulations by Qiu et al. show that while source-routed traffic can have negative interactions with intra-AS traffic engineering mechanisms in extreme cases, certain techniques may mitigate these effects [28]. In their studies, source-routed traffic could fully specify intra-AS paths. Our measurements indicate that such fine-grained intra-AS hop selection may not be necessary; hence, we expect that Platypus can be deployed in conjunction with existing traffic engineering techniques.

Furthermore, while we have equated waypoints with physical router interfaces, waypoints can be more flexible in practice. Our design for Platypus allows ISPs to specify any globally routable IP address within their IP space as a Platypus waypoint and dynamically adjust the actual (set of) internal routers to which the IP corresponds based on traffic load. We plan to explore this expanded ISP control in future work.

Independent of its interaction with traditional traffic engineering, Platypus introduces a new dimension for traffic provisioning: time. Routing in today’s Internet lacks a temporal dimension—the advertisement of a route makes it immediately available. With Platypus, routes may have time-limited availability; that is, a route is available only when users possess the correct temporal secrets. By appropriately choosing expiration intervals and expressing route selection policy upon key lookup, ISPs can control the temporal aspects of traffic flow. In this way, Platypus may even help achieve traffic engineering goals. While it is technically possible to implement a similar scheme using BGP, rapid, repeated announcement and withdrawal of routes can destabilize the routing system [20].

### 8. Related Work
Source routing has been a feature in many Internet architectures over the years. For example, Nimrod [10] defined mechanisms for both flow-based and source-routed, per-packet forwarding. Similarly, IPv6 supports the Source Demand Routing Protocol (SDRP) [14], which allows hosts to specify strict or loose source routes through ASes or IP addresses. More recently, Yang proposed NIRA [40], an addressing architecture aimed at providing AS-level source routing. NIRA path selection involves an initial discovery phase followed by an availability phase where a host assesses the quality of a particular route. Another contemporary proposal, BANANAS, allows explicit path selection in a multi-path environment but does not permit the insertion of arbitrary intermediate hops [38]. None of these proposals, however, address the need to verify policy compliance of the specified route on the forwarding plane. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to present a fully decentralized, authenticated source-routing architecture.

Frustrated with the lack of control in current wide-area Internet routing, researchers have proposed bypassing it entirely by forwarding packets between end hosts to construct routes with more desirable path characteristics [4, 31]. Unfortunately, the effectiveness of overlay-based approaches is fundamentally limited by the number and locations of the hosts involved. We believe Platypus addresses these issues: overlay networks can view distant Platypus routers as additional members of the overlay and use nearby Platypus routers to enhance the efficiency of their forwarding mechanisms.

Stoica et al. suggest that indirection should be explicitly supported as an overlay network primitive. In the Internet Indirection Infrastructure (i3), packets may include a set of indirection points through which they wish to be forwarded [36]. Unlike Platypus waypoints, i3 IDs specify logical entities, not necessarily network routing hops. Each ID is associated with one or more application-installed triggers that can involve arbitrary packet processing, with no guarantees about the topological location of the overlay nodes responsible for a particular ID.

Packet-level authentication credentials have been suggested in various contexts. IPsec-enabled packets may contain an authentication header similar to a network capability [6], but without a routing request. To verify authentication headers, IPsec routers must hold one key for each source, which is more than required with Platypus. Per-packet authenticators have also been proposed to prevent DoS attacks [3, 5]; implementing a similar scheme using Platypus would be straightforward. Perhaps the most closely related use is Estrin et al.'s introduction of visas, which confer rights of exit from one organization and entry into another [15]. Stateless visas provide a mechanism for per-packet authentication between two independent organizations but do not express routing requests. Visas result from a bilateral agreement between a packet's source and destination, with each packet containing exactly two visas—one for the source organization and one for the destination. In contrast, network capabilities are concerned with authentication and routing through intermediate ASes. In a subsequent paper [16], the authors also considered implementing preventive security measures within Clark’s policy routing framework [11].

### 9. Conclusions & Future Work
Capabilities are well-known in operating systems literature but have not gained widespread adoption in mainstream systems, likely because they are seen as too heavyweight for the relatively simple access problems of single-user systems. In contrast, we believe capabilities are extremely well-suited for wide-area Internet routing. Unlike today’s PCs, which typically serve a small number of users with similar goals and policy constraints, the Internet serves a vast number of users with diverse motivations, all attempting to share widely distributed resources simultaneously. Most importantly, there is no single arbiter (e.g., a system administrator or user logged in at the console) who can make informed access decisions.

Looking forward, while much work has gone into understanding and improving Internet routing policy, we believe much of the complexity stems from the inflexibility of existing routing protocols. We aim to study how inter-AS traffic engineering policies can be implemented through capability pricing strategies. For example, an AS with multiple peering routers that wishes to encourage load balancing may do so through variable pricing of capabilities for the corresponding Platypus waypoints. While modeling the self-interested behavior of external entities may be challenging, we are hopeful that this challenge is simplified by the direct mapping between Platypus waypoints and path selection, compared to the intricate interactions of various BGP parameters.
