* I have reviewed the FAQ for this repository and confirmed that this is not a duplicate.

I am currently reading the documentation on the website. On the following page: [https://dubbo.incubator.apache.org/zh-cn/docs/user/preface/requirements.html](https://dubbo.incubator.apache.org/zh-cn/docs/user/preface/requirements.html), I noticed a typographical error.

The current text is:
> “此时需要一个服务注册中心，动态的注册和发现服务，使服务的位置透明。”

It should be corrected to:
> “此时需要一个服务注册中心，动态地注册和发现服务，使服务的位置透明。”

Thank you for your attention to this matter.
