### Title: Black Hat US-22: Unlimited Results - Breaking Firmware Encryption of ESP32-V3

**Abstract:**

The ESP32 is one of the most widely used microcontrollers, found in hundreds of millions of devices, including IoT applications, mobile devices, and hardware wallets. In 2019, Limited Results presented a fault injection attack at Black Hat Europe, which successfully compromised the security of the ESP32-V1 chip family. In response, Espressif patched this vulnerability and advised customers to migrate to the ESP32-V3, a more secure silicon revision.

In this talk, we present an in-depth hardware security evaluation of the ESP32-V3, with the primary objective of extracting the firmware encryption key to decrypt potentially sensitive data stored in the flash memory.

**Methodology:**

1. **Fault Injection (FI) Attack:**
   - We employed a homemade electromagnetic fault injector to target the flash encryption keys stored in the read-protected eFuses.
   - Our experimental results show that the new silicon revision includes a bootloader that is resistant to these fault injection attacks.

2. **Side-Channel Attacks (SCAs):**
   - Given the bootloader's resistance to fault injection, we explored an alternative attack vector using side-channel analysis on the firmware decryption mechanism.
   - By measuring the information leakage during the power-up process, we were able to recover the full 256-bit AES firmware encryption key.
   - The side-channel analysis was conducted over a few hours, achieving a 100% success rate in key recovery.

**Practical Application:**
- As a practical example, we applied our side-channel attack to decrypt the contents of a hardware wallet, demonstrating the real-world implications of our findings.

This research highlights the importance of continuous security evaluations and the need for robust countermeasures against both fault injection and side-channel attacks in modern microcontrollers.
