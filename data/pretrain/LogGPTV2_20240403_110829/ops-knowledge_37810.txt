User: How to design a high-availability system architecture and maintain system stability and reliability?
Assistant: 1. Ensure high availability: Adopt technologies such as multi-node, backup, and load balancing to enable the system to keep running under abnormal conditions such as node failure or excessive traffic. At the same time, monitor and warn key services to discover and deal with possible problems in a timely manner. 2. Select the appropriate technology stack: When constructing the system architecture, it is necessary to comprehensively consider the advantages and disadvantages of different technologies, reliability, scalability, security and other factors, so as to choose the technology stack that best suits business needs and goals. 3. Reasonably plan system capacity and load: When allocating resources, it is necessary to consider the estimated load and capacity of the system, and use technologies such as elastic computing to dynamically adjust the number and size of resources according to actual needs. 4. Implement a disaster recovery plan: A comprehensive disaster recovery plan should be formulated, including backup and recovery strategies, data synchronization and replication, etc., to ensure that the system can resume normal operation in a short time when a catastrophic event occurs. 5. Regular update and maintenance: Regular maintenance of the system, including patch upgrades, software updates, etc., to deal with vulnerabilities and risks in the system in a timely manner, so as to ensure the security and stability of the system. 6. Establish a monitoring and logging system: establish a complete monitoring and logging system, track various indicators and changes of the system, discover and deal with abnormal situations in time, and ensure the reliability and maintainability of the system.
