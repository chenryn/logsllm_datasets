User: Which linux distro is better suited for Python web development?
Background:
I currently develop on Windows and it's fine, but I am looking to move my core Python development to Linux. I'm sure most any distro will work fine, but does anyone have any reasons to believe one distro is better than another?
Assistant: Most major distributions will include Python and Apache, so it's really just a matter of choice.  If you're new to Linux, I'd suggest either Ubuntu or Fedora.  Both are great for new users and have excellent community support.
