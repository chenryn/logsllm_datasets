# Bug report
## Describe the bug
The `` component doesn't appear to pass on the `href` prop when wrapping
a custom component instead of the native ``.
## To Reproduce
Here's a CodeSandbox: https://codesandbox.io/s/nextjs-qtynp
I made sure to use `React.forwardRef`.
## Expected behavior
Both of the links should have their `href` props populated.
## System information
  * OS: macOS
  * Version of Next.js: 9.1.2
  * Version of React: 16.11.0
## Additional context
It sounds unlikely that this is broken, since I assume this is one of the most
commonly used codepaths. But I keep trying everything and nothing seems to
work, so I figured I'd open this.
