# Advanced Wireless Attacks Against Enterprise Networks

## Step 6 - Install Domain Controller
19. Click the "Next" button immediately without modifying any options.
20. Set the Administrator password when prompted.

We have now completed the installation of the Domain Controller.

## Step 7 - Install Guest Additions on Domain Controller
### Objective:
Install VirtualBox guest additions on the domain controller. The following steps illustrate how to do this on the Windows DC virtual machine, although they should work on other Windows machines as well.

1. Start the Windows DC VM.
2. Press `[Ctrl]` + `[Alt]` + `[Delete]` to log in.
   - **Note for Mac users:** Since your delete key is actually a backspace, you must press `[Right Command]` + `[Fn]` + `[Delete]`. If that doesn’t work, select `Input > Keyboard > Insert Ctrl-Alt-Del` from the menu bar at the top of the screen.
3. If prompted to automatically connect to devices such as printers and TVs, select "No."
4. In the toolbar at the top of your VirtualBox window, select `Devices > Insert Guest Additions CD Image`.
5. Navigate to `File Explorer > This PC > CD Drive (D:) > VirtualBox Guest Additions`.
6. Right-click `VBoxWindowsAdditions-amd64` and select “Run As Administrator.”
7. Follow the prompts to install VirtualBox guest additions, then select “Reboot Now” when finished.

## Step 8 - Configure Active Directory
### Prerequisites:
- Download the AWAE Active Directory setup scripts from the following link and place them on your Windows Server virtual machine: 
  - [https://github.com/s0lst1c3/awae-ad-setup-scripts/archive/master.zip](https://github.com/s0lst1c3/awae-ad-setup-scripts/archive/master.zip)
- Ensure your PFSense virtual machine remains running throughout this section.

### Step 1 - Set PowerShell Execution Policy on Domain Controller
1. Open a new PowerShell prompt as an administrator.
2. Run the following command to set the execution policy:
   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
   ```
   **Note:** Due to security concerns, this is not recommended in a production environment.

### Step 2 - Install Prerequisites
1. Run the following script using your PowerShell command prompt:
   ```powershell
   .\Install-PreReq.ps1
   ```

### Step 3 - Install Active Directory Features
1. Run the following script to install the required features:
   ```powershell
   .\Add-ADFeatures.ps1
   ```
2. After the script has finished executing, open the following file in Notepad:
   - `C:\poshlog\featurelog`
3. Verify that the contents of the file are similar to what is shown in the screenshot below. If not, contact the instructor for assistance.

### Step 4 - Setup Active Directory
1. Run the following PowerShell script to create a new forest and promote the server to the role of Domain Controller:
   ```powershell
   .\InstallNewForest.ps1
   ```
2. When prompted, set your Active Directory recovery password to something memorable.
3. When prompted to reboot, click "Accept."

### Step 5 - Configure DHCP
1. Run the following PowerShell script as Administrator to add the DHCP role to the Domain Controller:
   ```powershell
   .\Setup-DHCP.ps1
   ```
   **Note:** This is not recommended in a production environment as it creates a single point of failure.

### Step 6 - Disable Windows Firewall
1. Open a new PowerShell prompt as an administrator and run the following commands:
   ```powershell
   New-GPO -Name "DisableFirewall" | New-GPLink -Target "DC=example.com,DC=com" -LinkEnabled Yes
   Set-NetFirewallProfile -Profile Domain,Public,Private -Enabled False -PolicyStore example.com\DisableFirewall
   Invoke-GPUpdate
   ```
   **Note:** It may take some time for these changes to take effect.

### Step 7 - Add Domain Admin User
1. Create a new user and promote it to Domain Admin using the following commands:
   ```powershell
   net user jcena Passw0rd! /add /domain
   net group "Domain Admins" jcena /add /domain
   ```
   **Note:** You can use a different username and password if desired.

## Step 9 - Add Windows Workstations to Domain
### Congratulations!
You have made it through the most time-consuming section of this setup guide. Give yourself a pat on the back before moving on.

### Prerequisites:
- Ensure both your PFSense virtual machine and your Domain Controller are running.

### Add Windows 10 Workstation
1. Extract the zip archive that we downloaded in Step 1 – Download a Windows 10 Developer VM.
2. Open VirtualBox.
3. From the VirtualBox main menu, select `File > Import Appliance` as shown in the screenshot below.
4. Select the path of your Windows 10 virtual machine (the `.ovf` file you just extracted). If possible, allocate at least 2 GB of RAM. Then click "Import."
5. When the VM import process is complete, select the new Windows 10 virtual machine in the list to the left. Go to `Settings > General` and change the virtual machine’s name to “Windows 10 AD Victim.”
6. Navigate to `Settings > Network > Adapter 1` and perform the following configurations:
   - Ensure that the “Enable Network Adapter” box is checked.
   - Set “Attached to” to “Host-only Adapter.”
   - Set “Name” to `vboxnet0`.
7. Click “OK” to return to the main VirtualBox menu.
8. Power-on the Windows 10 AD Victim virtual machine.
9. Go to `Explorer > This PC > Properties` as shown in the screenshot below.
10. In the Properties window, click on “Change Settings.”
11. In the popup window, go to the “Computer Name” tab and click the “Change” button.
12. In the popup window that appears, do the following:
    - Set the “Computer Name” to whatever you want.
    - Select the “Domain” radio button.
    - Set the “Domain” field to `example.com`.
    - Click “OK.”
13. You will be prompted to enter credentials. Enter the username and password for the Domain Admin account you created earlier.
14. If the authentication is successful, you will see a prompt similar to the one shown in the screenshot below. Click “OK.”
15. You will be issued a prompt stating that a reboot is necessary. When this occurs, click “Restart Now.”
16. Finally, install VirtualBox guest additions using the same steps you followed in Step 7 - Install Guest Additions on Domain Controller.

### Add Windows 8 Workstation
Repeat each of the steps you followed to add the Windows 10 workstation to your domain, but this time use your Windows 8 virtual machine instead. Make sure that you give your Windows 8 machine a unique hostname and name it something other than “Windows 10 AD Victim.”

Congratulations! You have completed the lab setup guide.
