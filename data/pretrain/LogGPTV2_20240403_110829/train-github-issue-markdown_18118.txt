I'm seeing webpack in watcher mode writing truncated files. The number of
bytes seems to always be either 1682 or 0 - not sure if that's significant
somehow. When its 1682 bytes, it cuts off often in the middle of a variable.
It seems like it just aborts writing right in the middle of things. When this
happens, I see the webpack callback being called many times in a row without
any errors or warnings, which my code takes to be a success. Looks like the
callback is being called somewhere around 40 times repeatedly, even though I
only made one change.
It seems to happen when I try to read from the bundle while its trying to
write. In those cases, it would make sense to me if the file wasn't written at
all, or if the system returned an error. But when no error is being given
back, and the file is partially written - that doesn't make sense to me.
Sorry I don't have more good info, its a weird intermittent problem, and I
don't have time to futz with things right now.
