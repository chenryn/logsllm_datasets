### 5.1 Accuracy

**Table 1: The accuracy of the confirmation/login phases in three tests.**

| Test | First Accuracy (Conﬁrmation) | Total Accuracy (Conﬁrmation) | First Accuracy (Login) | Total Accuracy (Login) |
|------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| First Test | 96.30% | 100% | 91.77% | 100% |
| Second Test | - | - | 76.54% | 92.59% |
| Third Test | - | - | 54.72% | 81.13% |

To analyze user recollection in our experiment, we defined two types of accuracy: first accuracy and total accuracy. First accuracy refers to a user successfully logging in on the first attempt, while total accuracy indicates a user successfully logging in within six attempts. Table 1 shows the first and total accuracy for the confirmation and login phases across the three tests.

In the first test, both first and total accuracy were high. After one week, the first accuracy in the second test dropped to 76.54%, but the total accuracy remained at 92.59%. Analysis of failed submissions in the second test revealed that participants did not forget their passwords; most still remembered the positions of the click-points. However, some points chosen were very close to the actual click-points but not within the tolerance squares, or users got confused by multiple sets of accounts and passwords. Most users eventually logged in after a few tries. If the size of the tolerance squares is increased to 30 × 30 pixels, the total accuracy of the login phase in the second test would rise from 92.59% to 98.77%. This adjustment, however, would decrease the security strength of PassMap, though it would still be considered secure (discussed in Section 6).

Even after a long period (six weeks), the total accuracy in the third test was 81.13%. On average, users could log into the system within 1.37 to 1.65 login attempts, with total accuracies of 92.59% and 81.13% after one week and six weeks, respectively, even with multiple sets of accounts and passwords.

### 5.2 Usability

We measured the total time and the number of functions used per login submission to understand the usability of PassMap in practice.

The total time for registration was relatively long (87.34 seconds on average), but this is acceptable because users need time to think about areas to select click-points and manipulate the world map. The total time for the confirmation and login phases in the first test was 35.30% and 30.62% of the registration time, respectively, which is 2.83 and 3.26 times faster. The trend in the number of functions used was similar (see Table 2). This demonstrates the advantage of using a world map as an extremely large password space.

After one week, the total time and the number of functions used in the login phase of the second test were slightly higher than in the first test, as users needed more time to recall their passwords. However, the total time was still 49.09% of the registration time.

**Table 2: The total time and the number of functions used in the confirmation/login phases.**

| Phase | Mean (s) | Median (s) | S.D (s) | Zoom Out | Zoom In | Search | Drag |
|-------|----------|------------|---------|----------|---------|--------|------|
| Login (1st) | 40.01 | 37.54 | 19.96 | 1.99 | 0.31 | 1.53 | 5.85 |
| Conﬁrmation (1st) | 34.70 | 33.29 | 19.97 | 1.00 | 0.00 | 2.00 | 4.00 |
| Login (2nd) | 55.64 | 52.45 | 70.31 | 2.50 | 0.77 | 0.82 | 8.60 |

In summary, PassMap is user-friendly in practice. Although users spend more time creating their passwords, they can confirm or log into the system faster (between 34.7s and 55.64s) based on their knowledge of the world map. The results are acceptable because clicking two points in a 226 × 226 pixel image and using functions to manipulate the world map are optimized. The low and stable use of each function in both confirmation and login phases indicates that users can easily manipulate the world map to preferred areas and use the system with ease once the click-points have been decided. Therefore, PassMap is suitable for practical implementation.

### 6. Security Analysis

#### Brute Force Attacks

To quantify the security of PassMap against brute force attacks, we calculated the entropy of the password space. Entropy represents the amount of information in the password space, measured in bits. A password space with x bits of entropy has 2^x possible passwords.

In our implementation, the world map is 226 × 226 pixels, with tolerance squares of 20 × 20 pixels. Since no participants selected click-points in the ocean, we excluded the ocean, reducing the effective image size to 226 × 0.2905 pixels (about 29.05% of the Earth's land area). We then measured the security strength of PassMap using entropy.

**Table 3: The entropy (bits) of PassMap and corresponding length of text passwords, compared with PassPoints.**

| Sequential Click-Points | PassMap (Entropy, bits) | Length of Text Passwords | PassPoints (Entropy, bits) | Total Accuracy |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|----------------|
| 1                       | 41.57                   | 6.35                     | 19.04                      | -              |
| 2                       | 83.14                   | 12.69                    | 25.39                      | 92.59%         |
| 3                       | 124.72                  | 16.62                    | 31.37                      | -              |
| 4                       | 166.29                  | 20.77                    | -                          | -              |
| 5                       | 207.86                  | 25.92                    | -                          | -              |

Table 3 shows the entropy of PassMap against brute force attacks and the corresponding length of text passwords, with 20 × 20 pixel wide tolerance squares, for 1 to 5 sequential click-points, compared with PassPoints. Even with only one click-point, the security strength of PassMap is close to that of PassPoints with five click-points, equivalent to a 6-character textual password. With our proposed two-click-point scheme, the entropy is 83.14 bits, equivalent to a 12-character textual password. This makes PassMap more secure than most graphical-password authentication systems in practice against brute force attacks.

#### Pattern Dictionary Attacks

Like other cued-recall-based systems, PassMap is vulnerable to pattern dictionary attacks. Attackers can collect the world map image and perform image processing to obtain hotspots and patterns. However, the cost of such attacks is significantly higher due to the larger image size of PassMap (226 × 226 pixels) compared to PassPoints (451 × 331 pixels), making it 3.02 × 10^10 times larger. Even excluding the ocean, the image size is still 8.76 × 10^9 times larger, increasing the computational cost.

Users may choose click-points near birthplaces or residences for easier memorization, reducing the image size and attack cost. This trade-off between security and user recollection is still favorable compared to PassPoints, as the map size remains large, and attackers must collect personal information or lists of famous landscapes. The average distance between two click-points in a password is 3198227.4 pixels, or 4997.23 frame blocks, further increasing the attack cost.

#### Shoulder-Surfing Attacks

Shoulder-surfing attacks target the visual aspect of graphical passwords. Attackers may directly observe or use recording devices to collect users' credentials. PassMap is not resistant to shoulder-surfing attacks but decreases the probability of successful attacks and increases the cost for attackers compared to PassPoints. It is difficult for attackers to determine the areas or how to use the map functions without recording the entire authentication process.

### 7. Conclusion

To address the password recollection and security issues of PassPoints, we propose PassMap, a novel world map-based graphical-password authentication system. Using a large world map image and a sequence of two click-points, we implemented a prototype and conducted a user study. The results show that after one week, the login accuracy is 92.59%, and even after six weeks, it remains at 81.13%. The total login time is between 34.7s and 55.64s.

PassMap provides 83.14 bits of entropy against brute force attacks, much higher than the 43 bits provided by PassPoints. The image size of PassMap is 3.02 × 10^10 times larger, increasing the cost of pattern dictionary attacks. We conclude that PassMap is a secure and user-friendly cued-recall-based graphical-password authentication system with easy-to-remember passwords.
