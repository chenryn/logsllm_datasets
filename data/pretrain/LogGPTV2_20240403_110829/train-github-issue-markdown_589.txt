Services should include a proxy subresource, similar to the one available for pods (i.e., `pods/proxy`). The endpoint for this subresource should be equivalent to the existing `/api/v1/proxy/services/[name]` endpoint. This will provide a consistent and streamlined approach for accessing service proxies.
