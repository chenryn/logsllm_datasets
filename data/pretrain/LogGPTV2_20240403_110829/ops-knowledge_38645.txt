User: I wanted to ask if you could call in a program written in Ocaml a program written in python , and if the answer is yes how do I do?
Assistant: You can execute commands using Sys.command, so you can just do Sys.command "python foo.py", assuming python is in your path and foo.py is in the current directory.
