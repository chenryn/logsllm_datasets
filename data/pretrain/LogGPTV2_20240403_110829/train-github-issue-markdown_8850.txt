Currently, the creation of decorations is limited to using image files by defining `gutterIconPath`. It would be beneficial to also support **Octicons** in a similar manner to how `StatusBarItem` handles them. For instance, the implementation could look like this:

```javascript
const myDecorationType = vscode.window.createTextEditorDecorationType({
    gutterIconPath: '$(icon-name)'
});
```

This enhancement would provide more flexibility and consistency in the use of icons across different parts of the Visual Studio Code extension.
