Today, I can only use images (files) to create decorations, defining
`gutterIconPath`. It would be interesting also support **octicons** , maybe
the same way that `StatusBarItem` does:
        var myDecorationType = vscode.window.createTextEditorDecorationType({
            gutterIconPath: '$(icon-name)'
        });
