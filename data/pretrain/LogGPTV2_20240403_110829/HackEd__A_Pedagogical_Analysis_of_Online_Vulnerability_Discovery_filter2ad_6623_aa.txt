## Abstract
Hacking exercises are a common tool in security education, but there is limited research on how they teach security concepts and whether they adhere to pedagogical best practices. This paper examines the pedagogical practices of 31 popular online hacking exercises. We derive a set of pedagogical dimensions from general learning sciences and educational literature, tailored specifically for hacking exercises, and evaluate each exercise against these dimensions. Additionally, we interview the organizers of 15 exercises to understand the challenges and trade-offs involved in implementing these dimensions.

Our findings indicate that most hacking exercises are well-tailored to students' prior security experience and support learning by limiting extraneous cognitive load and fostering helpful online communities. However, few exercises provide overarching conceptual structure or direct support for metacognition, which is crucial for transferring learned knowledge to new contexts. Immediate and personalized feedback, as well as secure development practice, are also uncommon. We observed a trade-off between providing realistic challenges and avoiding excessive cognitive load. Based on our results, we offer recommendations for improving exercises and suggest future work to support exercise organizers.

## I. Introduction
Historically, the security community has used online hacking exercises to provide practical education, exposing participants to various vulnerabilities and security concepts. These exercises require participants to find, exploit, and sometimes fix vulnerabilities, offering discrete practice sets similar to those found in mathematics textbooks. Hacking exercises are widely considered valuable educational tools, with security experts often relying on them for their own education. Bug bounty platforms also recommend these exercises to those interested in security, and recent security-education work has focused on creating new exercises. Prior studies have shown that hacking exercises can provide valuable immediate feedback in academic settings.

However, the analysis of hacking exercises as educational tools is limited. Many studies focus on only a few exercises, leading to a narrow understanding of the broader landscape. They also tend to measure specific aspects of learning and engagement, often overlooking more complex learning factors. As a result, exercise organizers lack guidance for building effective exercises, educators do not know which exercises are most effective, and researchers have a limited view of the current state of these exercises.

To address this, we review online hacking exercises to answer two main research questions:
1. **RQ1:** Do currently available exercises apply general pedagogical principles suggested by the learning sciences literature? If so, how are these principles implemented?
2. **RQ2:** How do exercise organizers consider which principles to implement?

We conducted an in-depth qualitative review of 31 popular online hacking exercises, completing 313 unique challenges from these exercises. We evaluated each exercise against a set of recommended pedagogical principles grounded in learning theory. Additionally, we interviewed the organizers of 15 exercises to understand their decision-making processes.

Our findings show that no exercise implements every pedagogical principle, but most principles are implemented by at least some exercises, often in unique and creative ways. Notable exceptions include the lack of structure to help students organize knowledge and the absence of feedback to guide their progress. Few organizers had considered metacognition, which involves helping students reflect on what and how much they have learned. We also found that some pedagogical principles are in tension with each other, such as balancing difficulty with realism. Finally, we observed that while community participation brings many benefits, it must be carefully managed to maintain educational structures. Based on these results, we provide recommendations for improving exercises and suggest future work to support organizers.

## II. Methods
To understand the current landscape of online hacking exercises, we conducted a two-phase study: a qualitative review of popular online exercises and interviews with their organizers. Here, we discuss our exercise selection, review process, and interview protocol.

### A. Exercise Selection
We focused on online educational exercises that meet the following criteria:
- **Educational:** The exercise explicitly states education as a goal.
- **Hands-on:** The exercise includes a hands-on component requiring students to actively practice security concepts.
- **Online and publicly accessible:** The exercise is available online, allowing us to participate and analyze it directly.
- **Popular:** The exercise is among the most popular, as determined by its Tranco rank (or Alexa ranking if Tranco data was unavailable).

We identified 45 exercises meeting these criteria, with 18 being synchronous (designed for simultaneous participation over a short period) and 27 being asynchronous (designed for participation at any time). To balance completeness with manual effort, we sampled about 66% of these exercises, focusing on the top 30% by popularity rank in each group and then randomly sampling the remaining exercises until we reached approximately 66% of each group. This resulted in a final list of 31 exercises, including BIBIFI and iCTF, which were added to ensure representation of attack-defense-style exercises.

### B. Pedagogical Review (RQ1)
To identify pedagogical principles, we drew on previous efforts to synthesize major theoretical and empirical findings from learning sciences and education research into actionable principles. This led us to five core pedagogical principles:
1. **Connecting to learnersâ€™ prior knowledge**
2. **Organizing declarative knowledge**
3. **Active practice and feedback**
4. **Encouraging metacognitive learning**
5. **Establishing a supportive and collaborative learning environment**

These principles are generally understood to support human learning. While there is limited evidence specific to security education, these principles have been found effective in related domains, such as STEM fields, including computer science education.

To identify actionable dimensions for each principle, we started with 24 dimensions used by Kim and Ko in their review of online programming exercises. We then tailored these dimensions through collaborative open coding of five exercises, resulting in 30 total pedagogical dimensions across the five core principles.

For each selected exercise, two researchers independently evaluated the implementation of these dimensions, using three levels: yes, no, and partial. We ensured consistency using a dual-coder agreement process. For each exercise, we reviewed all website components and completed at least one logical exercise unit, ensuring saturation of pedagogical methods.

In all cases, we completed at least five challenges, with an average of [number] challenges per exercise.
