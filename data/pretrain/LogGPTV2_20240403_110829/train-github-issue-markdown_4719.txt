Rather than rolling our own sparse-matrix library, it seems like it would be
much better to use PETSc, which is the de-facto standard here.
PETSc would give us access to a huge number of sparse-direct back-ends
(#2632), iterative solvers, sparse eigensolvers (#1573) via the SLEPc library,
optimized implementations (#942), multiple output formats, and parallel
support (currently completely missing and quite nontrivial to implement well).
Re-inventing the wheel here is a little like rewriting LAPACK.
