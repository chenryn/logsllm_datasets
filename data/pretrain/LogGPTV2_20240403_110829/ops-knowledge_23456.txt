User: How do I force my console window to be always on top with Python?
Assistant: Unless you are using a console window written by yourself as a "real" window you can alter the state of, you'd have to talk to the window manager (be it Windows's or some of the Linux ones).
But I agree with Paul Tomblin. I think most window managers have that feature built in for users to activate it if they WANT it on top!
