To ensure that your console window remains always on top when using Python, you typically need to interact with the underlying window manager. This process can vary depending on the operating system (e.g., Windows, Linux) and the specific window manager in use.

### For Windows:
On Windows, you can use the `ctypes` library to set the "always on top" property for a console window. Here's an example of how to do this:

```python
import ctypes

# Get the handle of the current console window
hwnd = ctypes.windll.kernel32.GetConsoleWindow()

# Set the window to be always on top
ctypes.windll.user32.SetWindowPos(hwnd, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0x0001 | 0x0002)
```

### For Linux:
On Linux, the approach depends on the window manager. Some window managers provide built-in features or shortcuts to keep a window always on top. However, if you need to do this programmatically, you can use libraries like `Xlib` or `PyQt`/`PySide` to interact with the window manager.

Here's an example using `Xlib`:

```python
from Xlib import display, X

# Open a display
d = display.Display()
root = d.screen().root

# Find the console window by its name (you may need to adjust this part)
console_window_name = "Your Console Window Name"
for window in root.query_tree().children:
    try:
        window_name = window.get_wm_name()
        if window_name and console_window_name in window_name:
            # Set the window to be always on top
            window.change_attributes(stack_mode=X.Above)
            break
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
```

### General Consideration:
While it is possible to force a window to be always on top programmatically, it is important to note that many window managers already provide this feature through user interfaces. Users can typically activate this feature manually if they desire it. Forcing a window to always be on top can sometimes be intrusive and may not be the best user experience, so it's worth considering whether this is necessary for your application.
