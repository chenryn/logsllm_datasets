User: I have written a python script and wanted to have it run at a set period everyday with the use of Task Scheduler. I have had no problems with Task Scheduler for running programs while logged off, before creating this task.
If I select "Run only when user is logged on" my script runs as expected with the desired result and no error code (0x0).
If I select "Run whether user is logged on or not" with "Run with highest privileges" and then leave it overnight or log off to test it, it does not do anything and has an error code of 0x1.
I have the action to "Start a program" with the Details as follows:
Program/script: C:\Python27\python2.7.exe
Add arguments: "C:\Users\me\Desktop\test.py"
I think it has to do with permissions to use python while logged off but I can't figure this one out. Wondering if anyone has suggestions or experience on this.
This is on Windows 7 (fyi)
Thanks,
JP
Assistant: I would try it with the script not in your Users directory
