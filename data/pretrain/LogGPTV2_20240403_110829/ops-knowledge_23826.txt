**Subject: Issue with Task Scheduler Running Python Script While Logged Off**

Dear Community,

I have developed a Python script that I would like to run at a specific time every day using the Windows Task Scheduler. Previously, I have successfully used Task Scheduler to run other programs while logged off, but I am encountering an issue with this particular task.

### Problem Description

- **When "Run only when user is logged on" is selected:**
  - The script runs as expected, producing the desired result with no error (exit code 0x0).

- **When "Run whether user is logged on or not" is selected with "Run with highest privileges":**
  - The script does not execute, and an error code of 0x1 is returned.

### Task Details

- **Action:** Start a program
- **Program/script:** `C:\Python27\python2.7.exe`
- **Add arguments:** `"C:\Users\me\Desktop\test.py"`

### Environment

- **Operating System:** Windows 7

### Troubleshooting Steps

- I suspect the issue might be related to permissions for running Python scripts while logged off.
- I have tried various configurations but have not been able to resolve the problem.

### Request for Assistance

I would appreciate any suggestions or insights from those who have experience with similar issues. Additionally, I am open to trying different approaches or configurations to resolve this problem.

Thank you in advance for your help.

Best regards,
JP
