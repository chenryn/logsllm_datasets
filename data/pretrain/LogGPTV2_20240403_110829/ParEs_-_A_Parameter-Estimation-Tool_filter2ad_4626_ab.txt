C. The Normal Family
The distributions of this family, namely the normal and
logarithmic normal (log-normal) distribution, are in general
not used for the modeling of failure behaviour, even if [3]
recommends their use in special cases also for reliability anal-
ysis. These distributions are typically used to model mileage
behaviour of technical parts. The log-normal distribution has
become the most commonly used distribution in this applica-
tion area. The CDF of the normal distribution is given as

and that of the lognormal distribution as
F (x) =

respectively. µ is the mean value and σ the standard deviation
in the case of the normal distribution. For the sake of simplic-
ity, we only consider the log-normal distribution in the rest
of the paper, as the formulas for the normal distribution can
be easily derived by omitting the natural logarithm. The CDF
can be transformed into
(cid:9)
F (x) = 1 − 1
2
· erfc
ln(x) − µ√
2σ
(cid:10)
,
where erfc is the complementary Gaussian error function [4],
which can be computed efﬁciently and in a numerically stable
manner with the algorithms given in [5].
As one can see,
the practical problems start one step
ahead of the parameter estimation, namely when choosing an
adequate distribution. This decision is getting even more com-
plicated by the fact that each of the mentioned distributions
can be approximated by one of the other distributions, at least
for special cases.
D. The Different Modes of the Data
This section describes the different modes of data that have
to be treated by the estimation algorithms. Most presentations
of the algorithms shown later implicitly assume a so called
“full sample”, i.e. all parts fail until the end of the test and
the exact time to failure is known. In reality, this is typically
not the case but one has to deal with clustered and suspended
data. Clustered refers to the case that the exact failure time of
an error is unknow. For example one has only the information
that there were ki errors for parts with a lifetime between xi
and xi+1 hours / miles. Suspended means that some parts
survived the end of the test, each of them with a certain
lifetime / mileage. Certainly, also the information about the
suspended elements can be clustered, for example there were
li parts with an operating time between xi and xi+1 hours /
miles that did not fail. To summarize this point, combining
all possible modes of single / clustered data with failures and
/ or suspensions, there are six combinations that have to be
considered in practice.
The main advantage of using ﬁeld data for analysis is that
one can be sure that these data reﬂect the behaviour of the
part under investigation under real conditions. Thus, by using
ﬁeld data, the most critical point of a test rig series – does the
simulated stress reﬂect the real usage stress – is circumvented.
But this convenience comes at a price: usually, ﬁeld data have
poor quality, which means they can have large error in the
registration of failures, such that the estimation algorithms
must be able to handle this low data quality. Additionally, ﬁeld
data commonly contain no information about the mileage of
the suspended elements, simply because one does not go to the
garage if there is no problem. Thus, in practice, the mileage
of the suspended elements has to be estimated, too.
III. LINEAR REGRESSION
This section discusses linear regression as the most common
statistical inference procedure. After the description of the
basic idea and the general algorithm for parameter-estimation,
the treatment of the different data modes is described in
Section III-A. In this section, also special topics regarding the
(log)normal and three-parameter Weibull distribution are de-
scribed. Section III-B describes the computation of conﬁdence-
intervals and ﬁnally Section III-C lists some limitations of the
regression method.
A. Idea and Point Estimation
The basic idea of linear regression is to transform the CDF
of the distribution into a linear form y = a· x + b, ﬁnd a least-
squares ﬁt through these failure data and ﬁnally calculate the
distribution parameters from the straight line parameters. In
the case of the two-parameter Weibull distribution with CDF
F (x) = 1−e
(cid:9)
, the linear form can be achieved by taking
the natural logarithm twice. This leads to the linear form

:=b

(cid:15)
One of the problems in applying a least-squares ﬁt to this form
is that one has only the x-values, i.e. the times of failure or
suspension, but no y-values, i.e. the probability belonging to a
failure at this x-value. Therefore one has to ﬁnd an estimation
for the correct plotting positions. According to [3], median
ranks, which have to be adjusted for the handling of suspended
elements, are used to get an estimate for the probability of a
failure at a given point. For the least-squares solution it is
important to note that there is usually a large error in the
time of failure, such that x should be taken as the dependent
variable in the ﬁt. The back-transformation of the straight-
parameters to the distribution parameters in the two-parameter
Weibull case is done by the formulas α = e
β = a.
− b
a ,
For the treatment of clustered failures and suspensions, there
are different possibilities: For example, [6] gives an algorithm
for calculating the ranks in the clustered case. In practice, a
simpler solution is possible: the failures or suspensions in a
cluster can be distributed uniform or normal within the cluster
and then the formulas for the single-data-case are used. This
surely enlarges the number of data-points that have to be
considered in the least-squares estimation, but in practice the

runtime of the estimation even with thousands of failures is
within a few seconds. Surely, assuming a special distribution
within a cluster is only valid if the clusters don’t become too
large. In practical applications as for example the reliability
analysis of car components, this is usually given. For example,
if one assumes a lifetime of a car of 500.000 miles and makes
up 500 clusters, each cluster will just have a range of 1000
miles. The error introduced when distributing the failures over
the cluster are usually much smaller than the errors that occur
when registering the real failure time.
The application of regression to the lognormal distribution
leads to a numerical problem, as the linear transformation is
ierf(2 · F (x) − 1) =
1√
2σ
ln(x) − µ√
2σ
and therefore requires the efﬁcient calculation of the inverse
of the Gaussian error function. This can be done starting with
the equality
(cid:12) (cid:13)(cid:14) (cid:15)
erf(ierf(y)) = y ⇒ y − erf(ierf(y)
:=z
) = 0.
Deﬁning f(zn) := y − erf(zn)
!= 0, one must ﬁnd the
zeroes of f(zn), where z0 can be approximated by one of
the series representations for ierf [7]. The solution follows the
idea of Newton’s Method [8] but uses a third-degree Taylor-
polynomial instead of one of ﬁrst order, which leads to faster
convergence, and erfc instead of erf for numerical stability.
This ﬁnally leads to the solution-formula

(y − 1 + erfc(zn)) e

2) (y − 1 + erfc(zn))2 .
Another problem is the use of the three-parameter Weibull
distribution with regression as one has to estimate three
distribution parameters from two straight-parameters. As the
parameters for α and β can be easily estimated by the method
described above, it is obvious to separate the estimation of x0.
When using a probability-paper it is a hint that there is an x0
if the plotted points don’t lie on a straight line. Hence it is near
at hand to use the correlation coefﬁcient for the estimation of
x0, which indicates how well the points ﬁt a straight line. This
(cid:16)
correlation coefﬁcient is deﬁned by [4]

x and y denote the mean of thy xi and yi. I.e., the failure-
times have to be shifted such that the correlation coefﬁcient is
maximized. A golden-section-search [9] is used for performing
the optimization. The shift needed for the maximization is
the estimation for x0 and the estimation of the remaining
parameters works on the transformed values.
B. Conﬁdence-Interval Calculation
As the point estimation of a parameter is only a number
without any indication about the quality of the estimation,
one needs an appropriate measure for the goodness of the
estimation. Usually, conﬁdence intervals are used for this
purpose. As the regression method is only a method for the
calculation of the parameter values and not the result the user
ﬁnally wants, we don’t calculate conﬁdence intervals for the
regression straight line but for the parameter values. [4] gives
closed formulas for the conﬁdence-intervals of the straight
line-parameters from which the intervals of the distribution
parameters can be calculated using the same transformation
as for the values of the point-estimation. These formulas are
given as
with
|˜a − a| < tα,n−2
|˜b − b| < tα,n−2

The Student-t-quantiles tα,n−2 used in these formulas, where
α indicates the error probability and n the degrees of freedom,
need not be computed but tabulated values can be used due to
the fast asymptotic behaviour of the values.
The problem in calculating conﬁdence intervals is to give a
conﬁdence interval for the x0 of the three-parameter Weibull
distribution. As the point estimation of this parameter is not
part of the regression, no conﬁdence intervals of the regression
method can be used for this purpose. Hence, one has to use
asymptotic conﬁdence intervals for this parameter, which are
for example given in [10] and work on the pure data and the
point-estimation of x0 without using results of the regression.
C. Limitations
Even if regression is the method of choice for most reliabil-
ity engineers, there are two limitations in the given application
