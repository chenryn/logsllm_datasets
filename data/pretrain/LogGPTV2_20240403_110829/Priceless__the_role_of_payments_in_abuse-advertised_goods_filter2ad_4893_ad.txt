points on a row that identify the bank the terminal is associated
with. Rows for a program with the same mark indicates that we ob-
served a program using multiple terminals at a bank, and rows with
different marks indicate that a program uses multiple banks. As be-
fore, we draw a line between purchases processed using the same
terminal if they appear within two months of each other. When ap-
propriate, on a separate row for each program we also show points
when we attempted purchases from the program but the merchant
rejected our order (i.e., did not attempt to authorize our card).
14Technically, identical descriptors could be used for different ac-
counts, but since we have access to the CAID information we can
ensure that each of these corresponds to a unique merchant ID.

work. Rows denote distinct merchant descriptors; row “X” shows
refused orders.
Some programs like Mailien use a single terminal at a bank at a
time, only switching when forced to. Staying with one bank mini-
mizes the cost and overhead of establishing merchant accounts with
another bank, but leaves the afﬁliate program open to the risk of los-
ing all processing capability if the bank terminates their relation-
ship. For example, when Azerigazbank globally stops processing
for these kinds of merchants, Mailien switches to Bank Standard
and uses single terminals serially over time. As per the previous
description of risk, it is precisely during these times when Mailien
is switching between banks or merchant accounts at a bank that our
orders are unable to be processed.
To further reduce risk, other programs use multiple terminals at
a bank simultaneously. When RxCash processes cards through Lib-
erty Bank, for example, it appears as if it is using at least two ter-
minals at a time on two different occasions.
Finally, some programs like 33Drugs maintain simultaneous re-
lationships at multiple banks at a time. Between July 2011 and
January 2012, our purchases are processed through four different
banks on existing terminals that we had originally seen used in
early 2011. Maintaining active merchant accounts at multiple banks
simultaneously has both cost and time overheads associated with it,
but it also reduces risk since the program is not dependent on a sin-
gle bank for processing cards and it gives the program ﬂexibility in

adjust to bursts of chargebacks through particular banks, etc.).
4.4 Payment under pressure
As a rule, any payment relationship takes time and money. If a
payment mechanism is working smoothly there is little reason to
change it. Thus, absent outside forces acting, we would expect that
an afﬁliate program (or a third-party processor acting on their be-
half) would prefer to use a single merchant account for as long as
possible.15 Conversely, if a merchant account disappears (i.e., this
account is never again used to receive payment for orders placed
with the same afﬁliate program) this suggests that the account was
closed due to some external pressure. This pressure could include
high charge-back rates, the bank getting nervous, changes in pay-
ment service provider and so on. However, we are most interested
in the role played by targeted pressure: the extent to which inter-
ventions in the payment ecosystem can be effective.
Serendipitously, there have been a range of such actions over the
last year which present an opportunity to directly measure the effec-
tiveness of this class of intervention. Moreover, we have obtained
data about the precise accounts targeted and the time at which these
complaints were delivered, providing us with an empirical basis for
evaluating outcomes.
As one example of this activity, Figure 4 shows the merchant
descriptors (anonymized by request) used by the PharmCash pro-
gram over time. The black points are product purchases made by
our group, while the red points denote orders made by an affected
brandholder used to generate complaints to the card association.
PharmCash, a modest-sized pharma afﬁliate program, initially had
two terminals, one with the State Bank of Mauritius and the other
with TBC Bank. Complaints occured in mid-November 2011 iden-
tifying both terminals, and within two months we no longer see
those terminals being used (note that this is an outlier in our dataset
and in all but a handful of cases a terminal “disappears” within
30 days of a complaint being delivered). Shortly thereafter, we see
PharmCash using two new terminals, one at each bank. Another
round of complaints appears to terminate both of these terminals
and PharmCash opens yet two more terminals at the Bank of China
and Agricultural Bank of China.
Taking into account the “takedown” complaint data set, we do
ﬁnd encouraging evidence that such ﬁnancial takedowns are ef-
fective. As a broad analysis, we examine what happens with pur-
chases to an afﬁliate program after each of its merchant descriptors
becomes inactive, i.e., we no longer see the merchant descriptor
processing purchases in our data set. After a merchant descriptor
becomes inactive, there are ﬁve possible outcomes for the next pur-
chase to the afﬁliate program: the purchase is processed on (1) an-
other “old” descriptor we had seen before at the same bank; (2)
a new descriptor at the same bank; (3) an old descriptor at a new
bank; (4) a new descriptor at a different bank; or, (5) we have no fur-
ther successful purchases through the afﬁliate program. Note that
the data is right-censored, particularly for very recent purchases,
due to our deﬁnition of “inactive”. Although we believe the anal-
ysis accurately reﬂects both our experiences and reports from af-
ﬁliate programs themselves, continued purchasing (which we are
doing) will further solidify the results.
Table 2 shows the breakdown of merchant descriptors for the
entire data set that fall into these ﬁve possible outcomes, with a
row showing the number and percent of merchant descriptors with
a particular outcome. For comparison, we separate the merchant

order placed two years ago.
descriptors into those where complaint purchases were not made
(185) and those where complaints were made (48). We also further
break them down by product category. As an example, among mer-
chant descriptors used by pharmaceutical afﬁliate programs that re-
ceived no complaints, in 17 cases subsequent purchases to those
programs used a merchant descriptor we had seen before at the
same bank.
Broadly speaking, complaints are highly correlated with pro-
grams moving processing to new banks or halting processing al-
together. Looking at the “Combined” column for descriptors that
had no complaints, we see that 36% of subsequent purchases were
processed on (old or new) descriptors at the same bank, while only
18% of subsequent purchases were not successful. In contrast, only
11% of subsequent purchases to programs that received complaints
were processed on descriptors at the same bank, while 69% were
processed on descriptors at a new bank and nearly 21% of sub-
sequent purchases were not successful. Note that even when pro-
cessing is not completely curtailed, forcing a move to a new bank
can cause signiﬁcant losses due to both opportunity cost during the
switching period and the likely forfeiture of holdbacks at the bank
they leave (which in many cases can be in excess of $1M).
4.5 Qualitative assessments
Note that the effect of complaints in this data are particularly
dramatic for software programs, where purchases on descriptors
after complaints nearly always went to either a new descriptor at
a new bank or were unsuccessful: programs clearly had to scram-
ble to ﬁnd processing at new banks if at all. We believe that one
reason this campaign was so successful is that it targeted all OEM
software programs and aggressively pursued each new account they
obtained—effectively promising that any new banking relationship
they created would swiftly be ruined. Even those specializing in
high-risk processing would have no interest in taking such a client.
We also have strong qualitative evidence of this efﬁcacy (with
two exceptions we explain in the next section). In a number of these
cases we had access to afﬁliates operating inside the program and
announcements of payment processing problems were distributed
to them. Wrote the operators of OEMPay in late November 2011
(translated from the Russian), “Starting today our bank has stopped
working. Due to this, we have made the decision to close our afﬁl-
iate program for the duration of our search for new processing. We
ask you to remove your trafﬁc and for your understanding in view
of the situation”. Similarly, we had access to a number of Russian-
speaking underground forums in which the OEM software business
was discussed. Wrote one participant (again translated from Rus-
sian), “The sun is setting on the OEM era” and one week later, “All
OEM afﬁliate programs have closed”.
While the pharmaceutical complaints are not yet as comprehen-
sive, this is undoubtedly because the space is larger, more sophis-
ticated and more proﬁtable. Even still there is signiﬁcant concern
among those working with such programs as well. Wrote one elo-
quent afﬁliate in March of this year, “Right now most afﬁliate epro-
grams have a mass of declines, cancels and pendings, and it doesn’t
depend much on the program IMHO, there is a general sad picture,
fucking Visa is burning us with napalm.”
5. ECOSYSTEM RESPONSE
No intervention exists in a vacuum and undermining the payment
ecosystem is no different. We have witnessed a range of responses
to pressure against payment processing and, while we are not in a
position to place these countermeasures on a comprehensive quan-
titative footing, we have more than enough qualitative experience
to identify several broad classes of behaviors. In this section we

describe these actions concretely followed by a broader discussion
about the nature of this conﬂict going forward.
5.1 Order ﬁltering
Since it is ultimately brandholders and their contractors driving
many of these targeted actions, afﬁliate programs can reduce their
risk by reducing their customer footprint. In particular, if they can
prevent an undercover buy from producing an authorization then
there is no way to tie a Web site selling brand-infringing goods to
the merchant account (and hence bank) normally used to process
its payments. While there is no perfect way to ﬁlter out undercover
buys (any more than there is a perfect way to ﬁlter out spam e-
mails) we have seen merchants take a number of steps that increase
the operational cost and complexity of undercover purchasing.
Phone veriﬁcation
As early as 2010, we experienced that some pharmaceutical pro-
grams (fourteen all told over the last two years) would hold an or-
der until they had called and conﬁrmed our order over the phone.
Typically, the customer service personnel ask about the details of
our order and our credit card number (and sometimes about any
past orders we had made, indexed by address and phone number
of credit card). In our experience, this veriﬁcation is primarily for
ﬁrst orders, with subsequent orders from the same individual go-
ing unchallenged. However, this veriﬁcation incurs additional op-
eration overhead for undercover purchasers and requires that they
both “maintain cover” and execute complete orders. By contrast,
however, we have never received calls from software merchants,
replica merchants or sellers of fake anti-virus software.
Documentation requirements
In addition, some pharmaceutical programs have started to request
additional documentation before they will process payment. No-
tably, RxPayouts (also known as RxCashCow) and 33Drugs have
requested scans of drivers licenses and physical credit cards, or
credit card statements, before processing our orders. Such actions
presumably ﬁlter out some fraud, but by the same token have the
more important effect of further complicating operations for those
making undercover purchases (i.e., now an undercover purchaser
using fabricated names must also be willing and able to fabricate
identity documents as well).
Most recently, another major private program, Club-ﬁrst, has re-
quested a scan of a prescription before processing an order for a
new customer. We can attest that this has not been the case pre-
viously. Moreover, we have observed the operator of Club-ﬁrst re-
marking, on a well-known Russian-speaking forum focused on var-
ious kinds of abusive advertising, that there were large numbers of
“test purchases” causing trouble. Thus, we infer that this prescrip-
tion requirement is a measure designed to counter this activity.
However, these restrictions can also be self-defeating as many
consumers regard these requirements as invasive and thus these
customer requirements can dramatically reduce sales. For exam-
