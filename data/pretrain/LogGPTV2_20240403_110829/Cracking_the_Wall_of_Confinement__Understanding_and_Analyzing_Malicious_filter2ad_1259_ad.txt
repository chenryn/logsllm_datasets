ing, based on analyzing the lifecycles of the 625,692 seized
domains identiﬁed in our research and the security weaknesses
in leading take-down parties.
A. Landscape
In total, we discovered 625,692 seized domains using
the methodologies introduced in Section III. The number of
conﬁrmed sinkholed domains was 608,557 (96.55%), and the
number of delisted domains was 21,757 (3.45%). Figure 5
illustrates the overlap between blacklisted, sinkholed, and
delisted domains. As we can see here, 0.7% of the domains
were sinkholed ﬁrst and then delisted. Also, 5.6% of the
domains on public blacklists were sinkholed, and 3.68% were
placed on hold.
As mentioned earlier, domain take-down is often used for
disrupting botnet C&C, where the seized domains are usually
generated by domain generation algorithms (DGAs) [53].
Therefore, we identiﬁed the DGA domains in our seized
domain list to measure the prevalence of take-down actions
against C&C domains. Speciﬁcally, we utilized a DGA de-
tection tool [7] that measures the randomness of domain
characters, which reported 405,330 (64.78%) such domains in
our dataset. The presence of the large number of DGA domains
does not come as a surprise, as in take-down actions there

is a tendency to seize (through preemptively registering) all
possible domains once the DGA is reverse engineered.
B. Understanding Sinkhole Operations
We also investigated sinkhole operations more closely,
given their importance in the whole take-down procedure
(more than 97% of the domain seizure performed through
sinkholing).
Preemptive actions. Take-down parties sometimes preemp-
tively seize some domains that are more likely to be involved
in cybercrimes before they are actually used by the malicious
actors. Most of such domains are DGA domains that take-down
parties reverse-engineered to identify all possible domains that
a bot may connect to in the future. Once these domains are
found, they are sinkholed before being used maliciously.
We identiﬁed preemptively sinkholed domains by checking
the PDNS records. Speciﬁcally, if the ﬁrst record of a domain
points to a sinkhole, this indicates that the domain is captured
at the very beginning of its lifecycle. Therefore, it is considered
to be a possible preemptive domain seizure. We found 388,378
such domains in our dataset. However, due to the bounded
history of PDNS data (the earliest record found in our data
set was on 2010-04-09), this method incorrectly classiﬁed the
domains that were maliciously active and then sinkholed some-
time earlier in 2010 as preemptively captured. To address this
issue, we utilized the domain’s historical webpage snapshots
from the Wayback machine [18]. We collected the snapshots
of 5,296 domains found to be sinkholed from day one in our
dataset. Nine turned out to have snapshots in the Wayback
Machine before the earliest appearance in PDNS and therefore
were dropped from our preemptive seizure list.
Ultimately, out of the 608,557 conﬁrmed sinkholed do-
mains, we found that 388,369 (63.81%) were preemptively
taken down. We then utilized the DGA domain detection
tool [7] to analyze these domains, which revealed that 92% of
them were indeed generated by DGAs. We randomly sampled
the remaining 8% of the domains (i.e. non-DGA domains but
preemptively taken-down), and found that they were actually
DGA domains but were misclassiﬁed by the tool as non-
DGA. We present the percentage of preemptive actions against
malicious domains per sinkhole operator and TLD registries
(top 15 most frequent TLDs in our dataset) in Figures 6a
and
6b, respectively. We observed that the percentage of
preemptive actions taken by Microsoft, the FBI, and Shad-
owserver was high, as more than 90% of their sinkholed
domains were due to preemptive actions. This could be due
to their involvement
in taking down pervasive campaigns,
such as ZeuS and Conﬁcker [5, 15]. Such campaigns led to
preemptively registering a large set of DGA domains that were
expected to be contacted by such campaigns. In addition, these
reputable take-down actors might have managed to get the
SinkholedBLABCDregistration fee waived [5, 55] and therefore did not have
ﬁnancial restrictions to register a very large set of domains.
With regards to preemptive actions in different TLDs, .cn,
.in, .me, and .name acted preemptively on more that
90% of the domains. This might indicate their high level of
responsiveness towards notices and court orders.
Active duration. We deﬁned the active duration of a domain
as the timespan from its ﬁrst appearance in the PDNS until
the moment when it was found to be sinkholed. This duration
reveals the intervention of different parties in the domain take-
down action. To measure this duration accurately, we excluded
the preemptively sinkholed domains, as they did not have
active durations.
Figure 7a shows the distribution of the sinkholed domains’
active durations by different operators in a box plot, where the
box is the interquartile range (IQR) from the ﬁrst quartile to
the third quartile, which contains 50% of the data that reside
around the median. The horizontal line in the box indicates the
median value, and the  denotes the average. As illustrated in
the ﬁgure, NameCheap and GoDaddy tend to intervene rela-
tively quickly (indicated by the low median), which is expected
because they operate as registrars so they can immediately
act on complaints or take-down orders. Similarly, we observe
that Spamhaus, which detects spam-related activities, reacts
quickly, with 75% of the domains taken down in less than 100
days. However, apparently, the sinkhole operators for security
companies/organizations vary in their response time in taking
down malicious domains. For example, domains sinkholed by
Arbor have longer active duration compared to Spamhaus.
Moreover, we found in our dataset that the FBI sinkholed
around 2,000 domains (non-preemptively). Among them, 718
were active for a long duration (≥ three years), shifting the
distribution up as shown in Figure 7a. We randomly sampled
200 domains to examine their properties and found that the
majority of them are pharmaceutical domains. This might
indicate that these types of domains are less likely to be
reported compared to other types of malicious domains, such
as the ones involved in malware distribution, and child abuse.
Figure 7b illustrates the distributions over the active du-
rations for the TLDs with the most sinkholed domains. As
we can see here, almost half of the TLDs, such as .biz,
.info, .link, .pw, .work, and .xyz, appeared to in-
tervene quickly which might indicate fast response to take-
down requests and court orders, as demonstrated by their
corresponding medians that tend to be very low and IQRs that
tend to be very narrow. The short active time of domains that
belongs to these TLDs could be due to their involvement of
notorious campaigns that required immediate actions.
Sinkhole duration. The distributions of domains’ sinkhole
durations by each operator is shown in Figure 8a. We can see
that the majority of the domains sinkholed by the registrars
(e.g., GoDaddy and NameCheap) tended to have a relatively
short sinkhole duration. Based on their third quartiles, we
found that these domains rarely remained sinkholed beyond
a year. We observed the transferring of some domains from
registrars’ sinkholes to other operators’, such as the FBI. This
will result in a short sinkhole duration at the registrars. This
indicates that some sinkhole operators may reach out to the
registrar ﬁrst and ﬁle a request until the legalization logistics
were completed.
We also observed that domains taken down by Microsoft
or the FBI tended to be sinkholed for a long time (as shown
by the high medians of their distributions). This could be
due to their ability to provide compelling evidence when
preparing take-down orders for court. For instance, Microsoft
may have the incentive to sinkhole long-lasting campaigns
against their products for a longer duration and could convince
the court by providing the number of affected users as an
evidence. Similarly,
the FBI tended to keep domains that
violate copyrights for a long time, such as megaupload.com.
This appears to be a preventive measure taken by the FBI to
prevent malicious actors from gaining control of the domain.
Moreover, similar to our justiﬁcation for the high percentage
of preemptive actions taken by these two operators, ﬁnancial
reasons might also play a role in long sinkhole durations.
We also observed variations in the sinkholing durations. On
one hand, some operators have relatively consistent sinkholing
durations. For example, the IQRs of Shadowserver, Securi-
tyScorecard, Kaspersky, Spamhaus, and Zinkhole are narrow,
which might indicate that these operators have uniform polices
that they apply to most of their sinkholed domains. On the
other hand, we observed a large variation in this duration
for the FBI and Microsoft sinkholes. This could be related
to the type of malicious activity the domains were involved
in. Speciﬁcally, domains involved in long-lasting campaigns
get long sinkhole durations, whereas domains that no longer
pose harm get released sooner. Another possible explanation is
that the variation is due to external factors, such as registries
policies, discussed next.
Figure 8b shows the distributions of sinkhole durations by
the different TLDs. In general, most of the domains under
.org, .info, .biz, and .ws have long sinkhole durations
compared to the rest of the TLDs, as illustrated by their
corresponding third quartile that expands on relatively high
durations (on average about two years). This could indicate
that the take-down duration of these domains was enforced by
these registries’ policy. For instance, the tendency of .org
domains to be sinkholed for long durations agrees with the
policy of .org registry, according to which it holds the
domain until a further court order [27]. We also observed
an interesting security practice applied by .biz registry in
which a malicious domain was held in their reserved set. For
example, the domain 4rme78bhg4bb3c64fw.biz was initially
taken down by the FBI. However, even after it expired and
the PENDINGDELETE duration passed, the registry kept this
domain in their reserved set instead of releasing it to the public.
This strategy is recommended for the most vicious domains to
prevent them from being re-registered and abused.
Sinkhole hopping. From the analysis of sinkholed domains’
lifecycles, we found that 4,418 domains were sinkholed more
than once. Around 70% of them were sinkholed by the same
sinkhole operator. This case could be occurring due to the
expiration of the domain followed by a re-registration or other
reasons, such as the “visibility” of PDNS. To estimate the
cases of re-registration, we calculated the time between the
two sinkholing actions based on the last seen date of the
ﬁrst sinkholing action and the ﬁrst seen date of the second
sinkholing action. We call this the release duration. If this
time is more than 75 days,
is a
new registration. We found that 340 domains seem to be re-
registered domains, with an average release time of 237.5 days.
it could indicate that

Although less prevalent, we observed that around 1,360
domains were seized more than once by different sinkhole
operators. We looked into these “hopping” domains and ob-
served that around 200 of them were suspended by GoDaddy
and then by NameCheap. About 10% of these domains had a
release duration of less than 75 days, suggesting that GoDaddy
may have immediately deleted the domains and the adversary
re-registered it. It could be also that the adversary managed
to transfer the domains to another registrar and resumed his
malicious activities until being sinkholed by the new registrar
again. Moreover, we found 10 domains ﬁrst sinkholed by the
Conﬁcker Working Group (CWG) [4] then by the NameCheap
sinkhole. The average length of their release durations is
around one year. As these domains appeared to be DGA
domains and were sinkholed by the CWG, it might indicate
that the adversary is interested in the domains related to old
campaigns. This is true given that we exclude the case of name
collision in which the new registrant happens to register a name
matching a DGA domain.
Another explanation for the “hopping” between sinkholes
is that a domain was released prematurely from the ﬁrst
sinkhole when it was still posing security risks, so it got
sinkholed again by another sinkhole operator. For example,
we found that around 300 domains hopped from Spamhaus to
Microsoft, Shadowserver, or Arbor Networks. As illustrated in
Figure 8a, 50% of the domains sinkholed by Spamhaus were
sinkholed for less than 400 days, which may indicate that the
second operator believed these domains still posed risks and
decided to sinkhole them again. Another possible reason is that
the operator of the second sinkhole wanted to control the trafﬁc
and assess the damage, inform the ISP of the infected host, or
download scripts to disrupt the malware on the infected host.
C. Exploits during Take-down Operation
The sinkhole nameserver plays a critical role in the domain
take-down procedure as it hosts a large amount of sinkholed
domains. Therefore, the nameserver is expected to be stable,
reliable, and also well managed. However, we identiﬁed two
misconﬁguration issues in real-world servers that led to a less
effective take-down operations.
Dangling sinkhole. A dangling DNS record is a DNS record
that points to “stale” information. Speciﬁcally, a dangling
record is a DNS record (e.g., NS, A) that points to a service
that is no longer assigned to the domain’s owner [48, 59]. This
could open an avenue for a domain hijacking attack in which
the adversary manages to take over the stale resource and thus
manipulate the name resolving process. In our research, we
found this security risk in a sinkholed domain. The misconﬁg-
uration allowed the adversary to hijack the sinkholed domain
by setting the A record to an IP address he/she controlled. We
reported this issue to the domain’s TLD registry.
Speciﬁcally, we found that a law enforcement agency
utilized a managed DNS service provided by Amazon (i.e.,
Amazon Route 53). This service was used to manage DNS
records of a malicious domain carders.org as part of a
take-down operation. The DNS conﬁguration of the domain
during seizure is shown in Figure 9. Later, when the law
enforcement’s account at the DNS service was deactivated,
Amazon Route 53 released the record sets to the available
pool. However, the domain’s NS records on the (.org) TLD
zone were still pointing to the previous values provided by the
