### Steps to reproduce
Run the provided JSFiddle
### What is expected?
The component in the slot should be moved from the table to the div element.
Or a new one is created and the old one is destoryed.
### What is actually happening?
If a slot is moved from a table to a div using a v-if directive, the slot ist
recreated. But before the new component is mounted, vuejs picks the wrong
component to destroy: it destoyes the new component instead of the old one.
