ABSTRACT
Detecting phishing attacks (identifying fake vs. real websites) and
heeding security warnings represent classical user-centered secu-
rity tasks subjected to a series of prior investigations. However, our
understanding of user behavior underlying these tasks is still not
fully mature, motivating further work concentrating at the neuro-
physiological level governing the human processing of such tasks.
We pursue a comprehensive three-dimensional study of phishing
detection and malware warnings, focusing not only on what users’
task performance is but also on how users process these tasks based
on: (1) neural activity captured using Electroencephalogram (EEG)
cognitive metrics, and (2) eye gaze patterns captured using an eye-
tracker. Our primary novelty lies in employing multi-modal neuro-
physiological measures in a single study and providing a near re-
alistic set-up (in contrast to a recent neuro-study conducted inside
an fMRI scanner). Our work serves to advance, extend and sup-
port prior knowledge in several signiﬁcant ways. Speciﬁcally, in
the context of phishing detection, we show that users do not spend
enough time analyzing key phishing indicators and often fail at de-
tecting these attacks, although they may be mentally engaged in
the task and subconsciously processing real sites differently from
fake sites. In the malware warning tasks, in contrast, we show that
users are frequently reading, possibly comprehending, and eventu-
ally heeding the message embedded in the warning.
Our study provides an initial foundation for building future mech-
anisms based on the studied real-time neural and eye gaze features,
that can automatically infer a user’s “alertness” state, and determine
whether or not the user’s response should be relied upon.

INTRODUCTION
Cyber-security is undoubtedly a topic of national importance.
While some cyber-attacks exploit the ﬂaws in the system design
or implementation itself, others are successful due to the potential
negligence or mistakes of end users. This latter aspect of com-
puter systems security, commonly referred to as “user-centered se-
curity,” forms the central focus of our work. There exists a num-
ber of attacks and vulnerabilities underlying user-centered security
systems. For example, users are frequently subject to phishing at-
tacks (i.e., presented with malicious websites which may look very
similar to real websites), which they may fail to detect, eventually
undermining the privacy of their sensitive information. Similarly,
warnings are regularly shown to users in order to alert them against
potential security risks (e.g., while connecting to a potentially mali-
cious site), which they may not read or comprehend, or may simply
ignore.
There exists a large body of recent literature focusing on user-
centered security (e.g., [9, 17, 18, 20, 32, 34, 39].), However, our
understanding of end user performance in user-controlled security
tasks is still not fully mature at this point. In this light, there is a
need for a detailed, root-level, neuro-physiological investigation of
human behavior pertaining to user-centered security.
In this paper, we concentrate on two classical user-centered se-
curity tasks: (1) phishing detection – distinguishing fake sites from
real sites, and (2) malware warnings – heeding malware warnings
shown by modern browsers when connecting to potentially mali-
cious sites. We pursue a comprehensive three-dimensional study of
479not only what users’ performance is in these security tasks (ﬁrst di-
mension: task performance) but also on how users actually process
these tasks based on (1) neural activity (second dimension) cap-
tured using Electroencephalogram (EEG) cognitive metrics, and (2)
eye gaze patterns (third dimension) captured using an eye-tracker.
An additional dimension we incorporate in our study is a user’s
individual personality traits measured with simple questionnaire.
Our Contributions: We believe that we make measurable progress
towards advancing the science of user-centered security. We are re-
porting on a ﬁrst triangular study of users’ neural response (EEG),
eye focus and dynamics, and task performance, with respect to
phishing detection and malware warnings. Our work makes sev-
eral contributions.
1. We pursue a novel methodology that combines multi-modal
neuro-physiological measures in a single study shedding light
on multiple facets of human processing of phishing detec-
tion and malware warnings tasks. This methodology might
be generally applicable to other user-centered security tasks.
2. We employ a neuroimaging technique (EEG) complementary
to the one employed in a recent “neuro-only” study (fMRI) [26].
The most notable advantage of using EEG (and a wireless
EEG headset) is that the participants can pursue the tasks
in a more realistic web browsing scenario. In contrast, the
study of [26] was conducted inside a scanner, under a supine
posture, and with “constrained” interfaces.
3. Our work advances, extends and supports prior studies in
several signiﬁcant ways (our results summary is below). On
many fronts, it also serves to independently re-afﬁrm the
ﬁndings of previous work and provides further support to the
existing knowledge in user-centered security.1
Summary of Key Results: Our study provides several interesting
insights and results. A detailed listing of our results, positioned
with respect to prior results, is provided in Section 8. In the phish-
ing detection task, we found that the users’ task accuracy is low,
which is mirrored by their gaze activity that concentrated more on
the “login region” and/or “company logo region”, and less on the
“URL region”, the key indicator of the authenticity of a website.
At the same time, however, users’ neural activity shows that they
were exhibiting high workload and were highly engaged in making
the real-fake decisions (and more engaged than distracted or sleep-
prone). In addition, there were some differences, neurologically,
in the way they processed the real sites and the fake sites. This
three-way result suggests that users may not be fully aware of, and
equipped to fully analyze, the main parameter indicative of the le-
gitimacy of a site, but they were certainly making an active effort
in this task (i.e., not ignoring it) and subconsciously processing the
real sites differently from the fake sites. This clearly underscores
the importance of continued training and education against phish-
ing attacks, and also suggests the possibility of detecting phishing
attacks programmatically based on users’ neural patterns.
The way users respond to and process malware warnings seems
to be good news all-around. The gaze patterns show that users are
reading the warnings, the neural activity shows that users are un-
dergoing high workload (more so when subject to casual news ab-
stracts) and are highly engaged (more engaged than distracted or

an established line of research in premier user-centered security
venues, such as SOUPS.
sleep-prone) when warnings were displayed, and the task accuracy
shows that users heed warnings on a large majority of occasions.
This may constitute a proof that users are reading, understand-
ing and acting upon malware warnings as stipulated, and empha-
sizes the continued importance of warnings as an effective means
of communicating potential security risks to users in real-time.
Finally, there exists a direct impact of users’ “attention control”
on their accuracy of phishing detection (the higher the attention
control, the higher the accuracy). This suggests that users’ suscep-
tibility to phishing attacks is a function of their personality traits
(besides their level of awareness).
Implications of Our Work: We believe that our study provides
a concrete foundation for building future mechanisms based on
real-time neural and eye gaze data, that can automatically detect
whether users are in “attentive” or “inattentive” states, i.e., whether
or not they are performing the security task as stipulated. Such
mechanisms can be developed using machine learning techniques.
“Fusing” neural and ocular features may provide a robust detection
mechanism (resulting in low error rates).
Another important insight from our study, in the context of phish-
ing detection, is that users’ mental activity may be implicitly in-
dicative of whether a given website is real or fake (although users’
eventual decision may be incorrect), i.e., users process fake and real
sites differently – this suggests that the system could automatically
detect a phishing site based on a users’ neural activity.
2. BACKGROUND & RELATED WORK
2.1 Overview: EEG and Eye-Tracking
Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive method of mea-
suring postsynaptic brain activity from the surface of the scalp as-
sociated with task-related or internal stimulation. The temporal res-
olution of EEG is superior to many other methods of brain imag-
ing. While other methods may experience a delay on the order of
seconds or minutes (e.g., fMRI – functional magnetic resonance
imaging), EEG is able to depict changes within milliseconds. Be-
cause of its higher temporal resolution, EEG is often used to eval-
uate the time course changes in brain activation across different
brain regions. This neuroimaging modality is also a good choice
as an investigative tool for assessing cognitive states (i.e., cognitive
overload and lapses in focused attention) which are not visible to
the observer’s eye, and may be overlooked or forgotten by the par-
ticipant in a self-report [11–13, 21]. Many commercial scale EEG
monitoring devices exist today. In our study, we use a wireless and
lightweight EEG headset (see Section 4).
Eye-tracking is the process of measuring the point of gaze and
movement of the eye. The technology has been commonly de-
ployed in many different domains including medical science, mar-
keting research, and psychology to understand users’ gaze trail dif-
ferent tasks. Many types of eye-tracking techniques are used today.
A popular set of eye trackers uses video captured by a webcam ca-
pable of recording infra-red light and mounted on an external dis-
play, without the need for any physical contact with the user. In our
study, we employ such an eye-tracker (see Section 4).
2.2 Related Work
Task Performance Studies: Closely relevant to the phishing com-
ponent of our study is study by Dhamija et al. [17]. Their results
indicated that users do not perform well at phishing detection and
make incorrect choices 40% of the time. Recently, Neupane et

We designed in-house software to execute the phishing detection
and malware warnings tasks in the Firefox browser (the study was
limited to Firefox given its popularity). The participants interacted
with websites displayed in the browser very much like a real-world
environment. A lightweight wireless EEG headset was used emu-
lating a minimally invasive browsing experience. The eye-tracker
was placed directly below computer screen, centered on the screen.
Figure 3 provides a snapshot of our experimental set-up.
3.2 Phishing Detection Experiment
Phishing involves stealing a users’ private credentials by show-
ing them fake replica of real websites. Fully in line with the design
of prior phishing detection studies [17,26], our experiment assumes
that the users are explicitly asked to identify fake sites from real
sites, and our focus is then to determine users’ performance, neural
activity and eye gaze activity in making the real-vs-fake decisions.
In our experiment, we presented the participants with real and fake
versions of popular websites, such as Amazon, eBay, PayPal, Face-
book and Citibank. The participants’ task was to distinguish be-
tween real and fake websites.
Experiment Design and Implementation: Fake websites (denoted
“Fake”) were created by modifying the URL, logo and layout of
the corresponding real websites, or by borrowing the phishing web-
sites from phishtank.com. In order to protect the privacy of partic-
ipants, while being subjected to real-world phishing sites, we pre-
downloaded these sites for ofﬂine use and hosted them on our local
web-server. The fake websites, which differ from the real web-
sites (denoted “Real”) only in the URL, are called “difﬁcult fake
(DFake)”, assuming they might be difﬁcult to detect. The other
fake websites, which differ from real websites in more than one
factor, such as layout, logo, fonts and URL, were referred to as
“easy fake (EFake)”, assuming these might be easier to detect.
al. [26] obtained very similar results based on an fMRI experiment.
Our task performance data also yielded similar results.
The malware warnings fMRI study by Neupane et al. [26], and a
ﬁeld study based on real-world browser telemetry data by Akhawe
and Felt [9], both suggest that users heed malware warning mes-
sages with a high likelihood. The malware warnings task perfor-
mance results in our study are consistent with these prior studies.
Many other studies, focusing on SSL warnings and security in-
dicators (e.g., [9, 17, 18, 20, 32, 34]) and measuring the users’ task
performance, generally suggest that users do not perform well at
these security tasks.
Neural Activity and Personality Studies: Neupane et al. [26]
conducted the ﬁrst study of users’ neural activity, measured with
fMRI, in phishing detection and malware warnings. They showed
that users exhibit higher activation in brain regions governing decision-
making, attention, and problem-solving (phishing and malware warn-
ings) as well as language comprehension (malware warnings). Our
neural results are in line with these ﬁndings albeit using a different
neuroimaging technique (EEG), and in a much more realistic set-up
(outside scanner).
Neupane et al. [26] also showed a negative relationship between
brain activation and impulsive personality traits under both phish-
ing and warnings, although such traits did not inﬂuence task perfor-
mance. Our study, in contrast, reveals a direct (positive) impact of
attention control on users’ task performance in the phishing task.
The study by Vance et al. [36] employed EEG to measure risk-
taking behavior in an independent psychological task (Iowa Gam-
bling Task) and predicted users’ task performance in the warnings
task. It argued that such EEG-based measures could predict warn-
ings task performance. Unlike the fMRI study [26] and our current
study, the work of [36] does not directly measure users’ neural re-
sponse in the security tasks themselves. The most recent study by
Andersen et al. [14] used fMRI and mouse tracking to argue that
polymorphic warnings can reduce the effect of warning habitua-
tion.
Eye Gaze Studies: There are also previous studies employing eye-
trackers to study whether users look at security indicators [10, 37].
Whalen et al. [37] argued that users do not look at these indica-
tors in general, but did not provide any quantitative results. Ari-
anezhad et al. [10] provided a similar insight in the speciﬁc context
of “single-sign-on” applications, based on gaze patterns (ﬁxations
and durations in areas of interest). Our study, in contrast, focuses
on users’ gaze patterns (ﬁxations and durations, and movement dy-
namics) when subject to phishing detection and malware warnings
tasks.
3. DESIGN OF EXPERIMENTS
The designs of our phishing detection and malware warnings ex-
periments are in line with the ones previously employed in [17, 26]
(phishing) and [26] (warnings). The fMRI experiments [26] had
certain limitations, however. Speciﬁcally, participants had to lie
down inside the scanner in a supine posture, look at low-resolution
website images shown on a small screen (640x480) inside the scan-
ner, and provide responses using a primitive button response system
(i.e., output-input interfaces were very constrained). Thus, the par-
ticipants’ neural activity and task performance in this set-up might
not have reﬂected their neural activity and task performance in the
real-world. In this light, we felt the need for a much more realistic,
EEG-based, set-up to measure users’ cognitive states and perfor-
mance, simulating a near real-world browsing experience.
