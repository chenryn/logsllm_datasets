User: I have a set of 10000 files c1.dat ... c10000.dat. Each of these files contains a line which starts with @ and contains a string with spaces specific for this file, lije c37  7.379 6.23.
I have another set of 10000 files kind of determined_cXXX_send.dat (where XXX goes from 1 to 10000). Each of these files has only one line. Each line is of thsis type:
_1   1   3456.000000  -21   0  -98.112830  -20.326192
What I would like to do is, for each number XXX (between 1 to 10000), get from the cXXX.dat file the string like c37  7.379 6.23 , and add it in the file determined_cXXX_send.dat to the beginning of the file so I get:
c37  7.379 6.23 _1   1   3456.000000  -21   0  -98.112830  -20.326192
I tried with both bash and python but got no good solution.
What would be the best approach?
thanks
Assistant: Doing this in Python should be pretty trivial. It's probably possible in awk, but sounds a bit too complicated to be fun. It's surely is possible in bash, but programming in bash is for masochists.
I'd go with Python, of the given options, although Perl and Ruby are good options too if you know them.
