Abstract. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in dramatic changes
to the daily habits of billions of people. Users increasingly have to rely on
home broadband Internet access for work, education, and other activities.
These changes have resulted in corresponding changes to Internet traﬃc
patterns. This paper aims to characterize the eﬀects of these changes with
respect to Internet service providers in the United States. We study three
questions: (1) How did traﬃc demands change in the United States as a
result of the COVID-19 pandemic?; (2) What eﬀects have these changes
had on Internet performance?; (3) How did service providers respond
to these changes? We study these questions using data from a diverse
collection of sources. Our analysis of interconnection data for two large
ISPs in the United States shows a 30–60% increase in peak traﬃc rates
in the ﬁrst quarter of 2020. In particular, we observe traﬃc downstream
peak volumes for a major ISP increase of 13–20% while upstream peaks
increased by more than 30%. Further, we observe signiﬁcant variation
in performance across ISPs in conjunction with the traﬃc volume shifts,
with evident latency increases after stay-at-home orders were issued, fol-
lowed by a stabilization of traﬃc after April. Finally, we observe that in
response to changes in usage, ISPs have aggressively augmented capac-
ity at interconnects, at more than twice the rate of normal capacity
augmentation. Similarly, video conferencing applications have increased
their network footprint, more than doubling their advertised IP address
space.
1 Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in dramatic shifts in the behavioral pat-
terns of billions of people. These shifts have resulted in corresponding changes
in how people use the Internet. Notably, people are increasingly reliant on home
broadband Internet access for work, education, and other activities. The changes
in usage patterns have resulted in corresponding changes in network traﬃc

demands observed by Internet service providers. Many reports have noted some
of the eﬀects of these changes from service provider networks [1,5], application
providers [19,23], and Internet exchange points [20]. Generally, previous ﬁndings
and conventional wisdom suggest that while overall traﬃc demands increased,
the Internet responded well in response to these changing demands.
Previous work has shed light on the nature of the resulting changes in traﬃc
patterns. In Europe, Internet exchange points saw a 15–20% increase in overall
traﬃc volumes [3], in some cases resulting in peaks in round trip latency in some
countries (e.g., Italy) that were approximately 30% higher than normal [12]. For
cellular networks in the UK [16], because users were less mobile, downlink traﬃc
volume decreased by up to 25%. While some of the characteristics of shifting
traﬃc demands are known, and certain aspects of the Internet’s resilience in
the face of the traﬃc shifts are undoubtedly a result of robust design of the
network and protocols, some aspects of the Internet’s resilience are a direct
result of providers’ swift responses to these changing traﬃc patterns. This paper
explores these traﬃc eﬀects from a longitudinal perspective—exploring traﬃc
characteristics during the ﬁrst half of 2020 to previous years—and also explores
how service providers responded to the changes in traﬃc patterns.
Service providers and regulatory agencies implemented various responses to
the traﬃc shifts resulting from COVID-19. AT&T and Comcast have made pub-
lic announcements about capacity increases in response to increases in network
load [1,5]. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) also announced
the “Keep Americans Connected” initiative to grant providers (such as AT&T,
Sprint, T-Mobile, U.S. Cellular, Verizon, and others) additional spectrum to sup-
port increased broadband usage [9]. Web conferencing applications Zoom and
WebEx were also granted temporary relief from regulatory actions [9]. These
public documents provide some perspectives on responses, but to date, there are
few independent reports and studies of provider responses. This paper provides
an initial view into how some providers responded in the United States.
We study the eﬀects of the shifts in Internet traﬃc resulting from the COVID-
19 pandemic response on Internet infrastructure. We study three questions:
– How did traﬃc patterns change as a result of COVID-19? Traﬃc volumes and
network utilization are changing as a reaction to changes in user behaviors.
It is critical to measure the exact alterations in a long time span.
– What were the resulting eﬀects on performance? Considering an expected
surge around the dates when states issued stay-at-home orders or declared
states of emergency, we seek to observe possible changes in the latency and
throughput of network traﬃc across locations. Further, diﬀerent ISPs also
have diﬀerent capacity and provisioning strategies, which provides us a ﬁner
granularity based on these diﬀerences.

– How did ISPs and service providers respond? Finally, to deal with the usage
boosts and performance degradations during the COVID-19 response, oper-
ations and reactions of ISPs and service providers were taken which may
explain the changes in network performance. The answer to this question
informs us of the networks robustness and their eﬀective disaster provi-
sioning strategies. These questions have become increasingly critical during
the COVID-19 pandemic, as large fractions of the population have come to
depend on reliable Internet access that performs well for a variety of applica-
tions, from video conferencing to remote learning and healthcare.
To answer these questions, we study a diverse collection of datasets about net-
work traﬃc load, through granular measurements, proprietary data sharing
agreements, and user experiences, as well as extensive baseline data spanning
over two years.
Summary of Findings. First, we study the traﬃc pattern changes in the United
States (Sect. 4) and ﬁnd that, similar to the changes previously explored for Euro-
pean networks, our analysis reveals a 30–60% increase in peak traﬃc volumes.
In the Comcast network in particular, we ﬁnd that downstream peak traﬃc vol-
ume increased 13–20%, while upstream peak traﬃc volume increases by more than
30%. Certain interconnect peers exhibit signiﬁcant changes in the magnitude of
traﬃc during the lockdown. Second, we observe a temporary, statistically signiﬁ-
cant increase in latency lasting approximately two months (Sect. 5). We observe a
temporary increase of about 10% in average latency around the time that stay-at-
home orders were issued. Typical latency values returned to normal a few months
after these orders were put in place. We also ﬁnd heterogeneity between diﬀer-
ent ISPs. Finally, we explore how service providers responded to this increase in
traﬃc demands by adding capacity (Sect. 6). ISPs aggressively added capacity at
interconnects, more than 2x the usual rates. On a similar note, application service
providers (e.g., video conferencing apps) increased the advertised IP address space
by 2.5–5x to cope with the corresponding 2–3x increase in traﬃc demand.
2 Related Work
The pandemic response has modiﬁed people’s habits, causing them to rely heav-
ily on the Internet for remote work, e-learning, video streaming, etc. In this
section, we present some previous eﬀorts in measuring the eﬀects of COVID-19
and past disaster responses on networks and applications.
Network Measurements During COVID-19. Previous work has largely
focused on aggregate traﬃc statistics surrounding the initial COVID-19 lock-
downs. Traﬃc surged about 20% in Europe for broadband networks [12]. In the
United States, a blog post [18] reveals that the national downstream peak traf-
ﬁc has recently stabilized, but in the early weeks of the pandemic, it showed
a growth of 20.1%. For wireless networks in the US, volume increases of up to
12.2% for voice and 28.4% for data by the top four providers were shown in an
industry report [6]. Mobile networks in the UK reported roughly 25% drops in

downlink data traﬃc volume [16]. Industry operators have self-reported on their
network responses largely through blog posts [1,5,14,17].
For traﬃc performance changes, diﬀerent patterns appear in diﬀerent regions.
Facebook shows that less-developed regions exhibited larger performance degra-
dations through their analysis of edge networks [2]. Network latencies were
approximately 30% higher during the lockdown in Italy [12]. According to an
NCTA report, networks in the United States saw less congestion [18]. Due to
decreased user mobility, cellular network patterns have shifted [16]: The authors
found a decrease in the average user throughput as well as decreased handoﬀs.
Feldmann et al. [12] observed that the ﬁxed-line Internet infrastructure was able
to sustain the 15–20% increase in traﬃc that happened rapidly during a short
window of one week.
Our work diﬀers from and builds on these previous studies in several ways:
First, this study extends over a longer time frame, and it also uses longitudinal
data to compare traﬃc patterns during the past six months to traﬃc patterns in
previous years. Due to the nascent and evolving nature of COVID-19 and cor-
responding ISP responses, previous studies have been limited to relatively short
time frames, and have mainly focused on Europe. Second, this work explores the
ISP response to the shifting demands and traﬃc patterns; to our knowledge, this
work is the ﬁrst to begin to explore ISP and service provider responses.
Application Measurements During COVID-19. Previous work has also
studied application usage and performance, such as increases in web conferenc-
ing traﬃc, VPN, gaming, and messaging [12]. Favale et al. studied ingress and
egress traﬃc from the perspective of a university network and found that the
Internet proved capable of coping with the sudden spike in demand in Italy [8].
Another paper used network traﬃc to determine campus occupancy at the eﬀect
of COVID-19 related policies on three campus populations across Singapore and
the United States [25]. The cybercrime market was also statistically modeled
during the COVID-19 era to characterize its economic and social changes [24].
Network Measurements of Other Disasters. While COVID-19 responses
are ongoing and evolving, making measurement eﬀorts incomplete, network
responses under other disastrous events can be informative. In 2011, the Japan
earthquake of Magnitude 9.0 caused circuit failures and subsequent repairs
within a major ISP. Nationwide, traﬃc fell by roughly 20% immediately after
the earthquake. However, surprisingly little disruption was observed from out-
side [4]. In 2012, Hurricane Sandy hit the Eastern seaboard of the United States
and caused regional outages and variances over the network [15]. For human-
caused disasters such as the September 11th attacks, routing, and protocol data
were analyzed to demonstrate the resilience of the Internet under stress. Their
ﬁndings showed that although unexpected blackouts did happen, they only had
a local eﬀect [21]. Oppressive regimes have also caused Internet outages, such as
a complete Internet shutdown due to censorship actions during the Egypt and
Libya revolts [7], where packet drops and BGP route withdrawals were triggered
intentionally.

Although there have been several preliminary measurements of the eﬀects
of the COVID-19 response, none have holistically studied traﬃc data, perfor-
mance analysis, routing data, and ISP capacity information together, as we do
in this paper. It is crucial to collect and correlate such information to better
understand the nature of both traﬃc demands, the eﬀects of these changes on
performance, and the corresponding responses. This paper does so, illuminating
the collaborative view of responses of service providers in the United States.
3 Data
We leverage multiple network traﬃc datasets to facilitate our study:
Traﬃc Demands and Interconnect Capacity: Internet Connection
Measurement Project. We leverage a dataset that includes network intercon-
nection statistics for links between 7 anonymized access ISPs and their neighbor-
ing partner networks in the United States [11]. These access networks contain
about 50% of broadband subscribers across all states within America. At each
interconnect interface connecting a neighboring partner network, the access ISP
