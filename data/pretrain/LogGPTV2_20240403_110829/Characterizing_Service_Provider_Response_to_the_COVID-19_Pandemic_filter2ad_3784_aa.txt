## Abstract

The COVID-19 pandemic has led to significant changes in the daily habits of billions of people, with an increasing reliance on home broadband Internet access for work, education, and other activities. These changes have resulted in corresponding shifts in Internet traffic patterns. This paper aims to characterize the effects of these changes on Internet service providers (ISPs) in the United States. We address three key questions:
1. How did traffic demands change in the United States due to the COVID-19 pandemic?
2. What were the effects of these changes on Internet performance?
3. How did ISPs respond to these changes?

We use a diverse collection of data sources to study these questions. Our analysis of interconnection data from two large ISPs in the United States reveals a 30–60% increase in peak traffic rates during the first quarter of 2020. Specifically, we observed a 13–20% increase in downstream peak volumes and a more than 30% increase in upstream peaks for a major ISP. Additionally, we noted significant variations in performance across ISPs, with notable latency increases following stay-at-home orders, followed by a stabilization of traffic after April. In response to these changes, ISPs aggressively augmented capacity at interconnects, more than doubling their normal rate. Similarly, video conferencing applications increased their network footprint, more than doubling their advertised IP address space.

## 1. Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in dramatic shifts in behavioral patterns, leading to increased reliance on home broadband Internet access for various activities. These changes in usage patterns have led to corresponding changes in network traffic demands. Reports have highlighted some of these effects from the perspectives of service provider networks, application providers, and Internet exchange points. Generally, the Internet has responded well to these changing demands, though specific characteristics and responses vary.

Previous studies have shed light on the nature of these traffic pattern changes. For example, European Internet exchange points saw a 15–20% increase in overall traffic volumes, with some countries experiencing up to 30% higher round trip latencies. In the UK, cellular networks experienced a 25% decrease in downlink traffic volume due to reduced user mobility. While some aspects of the Internet's resilience are due to robust design, others are a direct result of providers' swift responses to changing traffic patterns. This paper explores these traffic effects from a longitudinal perspective, examining traffic characteristics during the first half of 2020 compared to previous years, and how service providers responded to these changes.

Service providers and regulatory agencies implemented various responses to the traffic shifts caused by COVID-19. AT&T and Comcast publicly announced capacity increases, and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) launched the "Keep Americans Connected" initiative to provide additional spectrum to support increased broadband usage. Web conferencing applications like Zoom and WebEx also received temporary relief from regulatory actions. This paper provides an initial view into how some providers responded in the United States.

We study the effects of the shifts in Internet traffic resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic on Internet infrastructure, addressing three key questions:
- How did traffic patterns change as a result of COVID-19?
- What were the resulting effects on performance?
- How did ISPs and service providers respond?

To answer these questions, we analyze a diverse collection of datasets, including granular measurements, proprietary data sharing agreements, and user experiences, along with extensive baseline data spanning over two years.

### Summary of Findings

- **Traffic Pattern Changes**: Our analysis reveals a 30–60% increase in peak traffic volumes in the United States. For the Comcast network, downstream peak traffic volume increased by 13–20%, while upstream peak traffic volume increased by more than 30%. Certain interconnect peers showed significant changes in traffic magnitude during the lockdown.
- **Performance Effects**: We observed a statistically significant, temporary increase in latency lasting approximately two months, with average latency increasing by about 10% around the time stay-at-home orders were issued. Latency values returned to normal a few months after these orders were put in place. There was also heterogeneity between different ISPs.
- **ISP Responses**: ISPs added capacity at interconnects at more than twice the usual rate. Application service providers, such as video conferencing apps, increased their advertised IP address space by 2.5–5x to cope with a 2–3x increase in traffic demand.

## 2. Related Work

### Network Measurements During COVID-19

Previous work has focused on aggregate traffic statistics surrounding the initial COVID-19 lockdowns. In Europe, broadband networks saw a 20% surge in traffic. In the United States, national downstream peak traffic stabilized after an initial 20.1% growth. Wireless networks in the US reported volume increases of up to 12.2% for voice and 28.4% for data. Mobile networks in the UK saw a 25% drop in downlink data traffic volume. Industry operators have self-reported on their network responses through blog posts.

For traffic performance changes, different regions showed different patterns. Facebook's analysis of edge networks revealed larger performance degradations in less-developed regions. Network latencies in Italy were approximately 30% higher during the lockdown. According to an NCTA report, networks in the United States saw less congestion. Cellular network patterns shifted due to decreased user mobility, with a decrease in average user throughput and handoffs.

Our work differs from and builds on these previous studies by extending over a longer time frame and using longitudinal data to compare traffic patterns during the past six months to those in previous years. Due to the evolving nature of the pandemic, previous studies have been limited to short time frames and primarily focused on Europe. This work also explores ISP and service provider responses, which, to our knowledge, is the first to do so.

### Application Measurements During COVID-19

Previous studies have examined application usage and performance, such as increases in web conferencing traffic, VPN, gaming, and messaging. Favale et al. studied ingress and egress traffic from a university network perspective and found that the Internet coped well with the sudden spike in demand in Italy. Another study used network traffic to determine campus occupancy and the effects of COVID-19 related policies on three campuses in Singapore and the United States. The cybercrime market was also statistically modeled to characterize its economic and social changes during the pandemic.

### Network Measurements of Other Disasters

While the ongoing and evolving nature of the COVID-19 response makes measurement efforts incomplete, network responses to other disasters can be informative. For example, the 2011 Japan earthquake caused circuit failures and subsequent repairs within a major ISP, with nationwide traffic falling by roughly 20%. However, there was little disruption observed from outside. Hurricane Sandy in 2012 caused regional outages and variances over the network. Human-caused disasters, such as the September 11th attacks, demonstrated the resilience of the Internet under stress, with unexpected blackouts having only local effects. Oppressive regimes have also caused Internet outages, such as the complete shutdown due to censorship actions during the Egypt and Libya revolts.

Although there have been several preliminary measurements of the effects of the COVID-19 response, none have holistically studied traffic data, performance analysis, routing data, and ISP capacity information together. This paper does so, providing a comprehensive view of the collaborative responses of service providers in the United States.

## 3. Data

We leverage multiple network traffic datasets to facilitate our study:

### Traffic Demands and Interconnect Capacity: Internet Connection Measurement Project

We use a dataset that includes network interconnection statistics for links between seven anonymized access ISPs and their neighboring partner networks in the United States. These access networks cover about 50% of broadband subscribers across all states. At each interconnect interface, the access ISP collects detailed traffic data, allowing us to analyze the changes in traffic patterns and capacity augmentation.
