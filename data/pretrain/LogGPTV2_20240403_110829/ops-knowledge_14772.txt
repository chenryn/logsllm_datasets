User: Is there a way to determine which process is sending a particular packet. I am capturing packets on Network Interface card and want to determine the process for each packet. I am working in python under Windows.
Assistant: Until you don't implement your own packet filter driver you can't do that just looking on a data stream captured via network card promiscuous mode.
