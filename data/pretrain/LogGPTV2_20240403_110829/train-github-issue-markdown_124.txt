In a sample typescript react project,
  1. Add test-component-library dependency int package.json =>  
"dependencies": {  
"test-component-library": "git+https://github.com/anmdsystems/test-component-
library.git"
  2. Add App.tsx => return  
import React from 'react';  
import './App.css';  
import { Button } from 'test-component-library';
function App() {  
return
}
export default App;
  3. Run the sample app, console shows the error message
Warning: Invalid hook call. Hooks can only be called inside of the body of a
function component. This could happen for one of the following reasons:
  1. You might have mismatching versions of React and the renderer (such as React DOM)
  2. You might be breaking the Rules of Hooks
  3. You might have more than one copy of React in the same app  
See https://reactjs.org/link/invalid-hook-call for tips about how to debug and
fix this problem.
