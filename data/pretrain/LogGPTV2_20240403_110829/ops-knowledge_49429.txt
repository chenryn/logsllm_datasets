User: Please describe the definition and working principle of Aggregation Switching.
Assistant: Aggregation Switching is a data center network architecture, also known as Aggregation Access Layer Switching. It improves network performance and reliability by converting multiple smaller switches into one larger switch. Here's how it works: In a data center, there are many servers that need to communicate with storage devices and networks, often connected with smaller switches. These small switches are aggregated to one or more larger aggregate switches, enabling higher network capacity and throughput. Therefore, the aggregation switch acts as the aggregation point of the network, which can increase network bandwidth, optimize network performance, and improve reliability. At the same time, the aggregation switch can also provide redundancy to prevent the failure of a single switch from causing network interruption. In short, aggregation switching is a network architecture with high performance, high reliability, and strong scalability, which is suitable for data centers or enterprise networks that require large amounts of data transmission.
