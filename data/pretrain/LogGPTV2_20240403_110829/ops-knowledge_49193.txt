User: How to strengthen the security of the server and harden the system to prevent network attacks and data leakage?
Assistant: Server security reinforcement and system hardening are important measures to ensure server security. The following measures can be taken: 1. Update the latest security patches of the operating system and software to ensure that the server operating system and applications are not affected by known vulnerability attacks. 2. Enable firewalls and network security devices, restrict access to the IP address and port number of the server, and block unauthorized access. 3. Disable unnecessary services and ports, ensure that the server only runs necessary services and ports, and limit the entrance of attacks. 4. Set strong password policy and account lockout policy to ensure the password strength and update cycle of all users of the server, and enable account lockout policy to limit the entrance of brute force cracking passwords. 5. Restrict file and directory permissions, ensure that sensitive data and key files on the server can only be accessed and modified by authorized users, and restrict access and tampering by unauthorized users. 6. Regularly back up data and logs to ensure the integrity and recoverability of server data and logs, and to recover in time for security incidents. 7. Install intrusion detection and anti-virus software to detect and intercept abnormal network traffic and malicious code attacks in a timely manner. 8. Conduct security audit and monitoring of the server, monitor the security status and abnormal events of the server in real time, and respond and deal with them in a timely manner. The above are some basic measures for security hardening and system hardening, and more detailed and personalized hardening and hardening measures can be carried out according to specific situations.
