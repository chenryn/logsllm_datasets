48,000 destination addresses, while compromised IoT devices
in CPS targeted less ports (about 18,000) on signiﬁcantly less
number of destination addresses (14,700).
The comparison of the overall behavior of compromised IoT
devices in CPS and consumer realms in terms of the generated
UDP packets, and targeted destination addresses and ports,
illustrates a number of differences. First, the compromised
consumer IoT devices were actively sending UDP packets
during repeated intervals that lasted for longer hours than
those compromised in CPS. Second,
the total number of
generated UDP packets per hour by compromised consumer
IoT devices was very close to the total number of targeted
destination IP addresses (Figure 5b), and therefore, very few
packets were sent towards each destination IP. We also found
a strong positive correlation between the number of targeted
ports and destination IP addresses by compromised consumer
IoT devices (Pearson’s correlation r = 0.95 and p <0. 0001),
which may indicate the effort of such devices to reach a wider
range of new destination IP addresses on various ports at each
interval. Finally, the compromised CPS devices generated a
signiﬁcantly larger number of UDP packets per hour towards
the targeted destinations, with packets possibly sent
to a
relatively larger number of ports on the same destinations, as
illustrated by the recurring spikes in the number of contacted
destination ports per hour (Figure 5a).
2) UDP Ports: The compromised IoT devices generated
UDP packets towards all available UDP ports (65,535). About
10.7% of all UDP packets were targeting the top 10 ports (Ta-
ble IV), while the remaining packets (89.3%) were distributed
among over 60,000 ports. As shown in Table IV, port 37547
received about 329,000 UDP packets (2.5% of all), followed
by port 137 (NetBIOS) and port 53413 with 2.06% and 2.05%
of all UDP trafﬁc respectively. In addition, while destination
ports 37547, 32124, and 28183 were targeted by more than
9,000 compromised IoT devices, the remaining ports received
UDP packets from signiﬁcantly less number of compromised
IoT devices (Table IV). We identiﬁed 5 assigned (well-known)
services/protocols that correspond to the top 10 targeted ports.
Nevertheless, although the remaining ports were not ofﬁcially
assigned to any services/protocols, some of them are known
to be associated with known vulnerabilities. For instance, port
37547 has been associated with a backdoor to exploit and
control “Netcore/Netis” routers [34].

B. Unsolicited Backscatter Trafﬁc
Backscatter trafﬁc, in the context of this work, is a byprod-
uct of (D)DoS attacks that target IoT devices. When a victim
IoT device is attacked by a ﬂood of packets generated from
spoofed source IP addresses (that happened to be belonging
to the network telescope IP space), the device will generate
reply packets destined to the darknet, which can then be
collected and extracted. These packets are mainly TCP (SYN-
ACK and RST) or ICMP reply packets (Echo Reply, Destina-
tion Unreachable, Source Quench, Redirect, Time Exceeded,
Parameter Problem, Timestamp Reply, Information Reply, or
Address Mask Reply) [13].
Our analysis revealed a total of 839 IoT devices that have
fallen victims of DoS attacks, with about 10.3M backscatter
packets generated towards the darknet (8.2% of total trafﬁc).
Approximately half of the victim IoT devices generated less
than 170 backscatter packets towards the darknet, while about
17% of the IoT devices generated 10,000 or more backscat-
ter packets (Figure 6). Moreover, only 7 devices generated
100,000 or more backscatter packets, among which 5 of them
were likely to be operating in critical CPS realms. In general,
about 73% of all backscatter packets were generated by IoT
devices in CPS, which represent slightly more than half of the
DoS victims (53%). In fact, 5 IoT devices in CPS contributed
to about 43% of all backscatter trafﬁc, with two devices

that generated about 1.1 and 3.4 million packets respectively.
These observations may reﬂect the nature of the inferred DoS
attacks that were focused on target devices in CPS with higher
intensity as compared to consumer IoT devices.
1) IoT DoS Victims: By investigating the distribution of
backscatter packets as illustrated in Figure 7, we observed few
instances with noticeable increase in the number of generated
backscatter packets by the IoT devices (e.g., between intervals
6 and 8). These sudden spikes indicate a large magnitude of
DoS attacks against CPS and consumer IoT devices during the
speciﬁed time intervals. It is apparent that IoT devices in CPS
realms were attacked more often and with higher intensity as
compared to consumer IoT devices. In fact, a conducted Mann-
Whitney U test showed a statistically signiﬁcant difference
between the number of generated backscatter packets per hour
when comparing IoT devices in CPS and consumer realms
(p < 0.0001, U = 6061, and Z = −5.95).
To further investigate targeted IoT devices as DoS victims,
we focused at intervals with sudden spikes in the number of
backscatter packets. Interestingly, a single victim IoT device
generated almost all
the packets during every DoS attack
interval. For instance, an IoT device in a CPS realm located
in China was responsible for more than 99% of all backscatter
trafﬁc during intervals 6-8 and 53-55, and about 89% of trafﬁc
at interval 56. Similarly, a different CPS device from China
was found to be under DoS attacks during intervals 99 and
127, generating about 91% and 97% of all backscatter trafﬁc
at those intervals respectively. Both of the aforementioned IoT
device operated Ethernet/IP on TCP/UDP port 44818, which is
used in manufacturing automation. After some investigations,
we inferred that this service is associated with “Rockwell
Automation Control Logix PLC” vulnerabilities, which can
cause DoS on the targeted IoT devices.1 Finally, an IoT
device in a CPS from Switzerland, which supports Telvent
OASyS DNA (used in oil and gas transportation pipelines and
distribution networks), contributed towards about 85% of the
backscatter trafﬁc at interval 94, indicating another instance
of targeted DoS attacks.
Analyzing the DoS events for the consumer IoT devices
resulted in similar behavior as the CPS devices. For instance,
a printer located in the Netherlands, generated over 104,000

backscatter packets at interval 49, contributing towards 98%
of all packets at this interval. In addition, another printer from
the U.K. was found to be under targeted DoS attacks as it
generated about 85% of all backscatter packets at interval 81.
2) Targeted Countries: The targted IoT devices were found
to be located in 80 countries, with China, Singapore, and
the U.S. hosting the highest number of DoS IoT victims,
respectively (Figure 8a). Moreover, China and the U.S. hosted
the most number of targeted IoT devices in CPS realms (103
and 49 devices, respectively), while Singapore and Indonesia
hosted the highest number of consumer IoT device victims
(64 and 52 devices). From a different perspective, about
52% of all backscatter trafﬁc was generated by IoT devices
hosted in China, followed by devices in the U.S. (5.9%) and
the U.K. (4.1%), respectively. In addition, we noticed that
the U.K, Brazil, Switzerland, and Argentina, were among
the top 15 countries with the highest number of generated
backscatter packets (Figure 8b), while hosting relatively few
victim IoT devices (10, 16, 4, and 5 devices, respectively).
This corroborates our previous ﬁndings regarding the nature
of the observed DoS attacks during the analysis intervals,
which represent intensive targeted attacks on a small number
of victim IoT devices.
C. Unsolicited Scanning Trafﬁc
Probing trafﬁc generated from unsolicited IoT devices that
target the network telescope is an indicator of exploitations of
such IoT devices. Such compromised devices would typically
be scanning the Internet looking to exploit vulnerable hosts or
other IoT devices. In order to identify IoT-generated scanning
trafﬁc, we ﬁrst looked at the remaining non-backscatter ICMP
packets, which represented a very small percentage of the
total generated trafﬁc by compromised IoT devices (0.23%).
More than 99.9% of these packets were ICMP Echo requests,
which are typically used for remote network scans (e.g., ping).
Moreover, these packets were originated from 56 exploited IoT
devices, among which 32 consumer IoT devices generated the
majority of the ICMP scanning packets (93%). We also iden-
tiﬁed slightly over 100M TCP packets that were not classiﬁed
as backscatter. These TCP packets were mainly TCP-SYN
packets (99.97%), which are commonly used for scanning the
