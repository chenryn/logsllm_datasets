User: I am using OS X 1.6 snow leopard and I successfully got PIL installed. I am able to open terminal and type import Image without any errors.
However, When using app engine I get Image error still saying that PIL is not installed. I am wondering if any of you have an thoughts as to how I can resolve this issue.

Assistant: How did you install PIL?  If I remember correctly, I had to install it via MacPorts to get the App Engine SDK to recognize that it was installed.
You should probably install Python 2.5 and use that, while you're at it, since that is the Python version that App Engine uses and developing against 2.6 locally could potentially lead to surprising issues when you deploy your app.
