User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How should I securely type a password in front of a lot of people? I am a manager in an office where the company does not provide a company email, so I use my personal email.

Often, I will receive jobs lists by email from my general manager.

How should I log in to my email in front of my co-workers so that they don't see my password?

My email service uses end to end encryption, which means that it does not store or reset my password.

I also cannot move the screen so my co-workers cannot see it.

Assistant: Use the blanket of security, as seen in the Snowden documentary Citizenfour.
It involves placing a blanket over your head, the keyboard and monitor and typing in the password. 
It will look weird but for security's sake it may be worth it.
