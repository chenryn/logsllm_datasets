backup multiplexing on L7  degrades the fault-tolerance 
capability. 
The above observation shows that routing channels 
under  backup  multiplexing  has  a  significant  bearing 
on  the  resulting  fault-tolerance  capability.  An  ideal 
backup channel B  should (1) provide  the same QoS  as 
its primary upon  its activation; (2) overlap minimally 
with its primary; and (3) overlap minimally  with other 
backups whose primaries overlap with B’s primary. 
To  find  a backup  route  that  meets  these  three  re- 
quirements,  one  must  know  where  primary  channel 
paths run, where the corresponding backup paths run, 
and the amount  of  resources  available  on  these paths. 
However,  requiring  every  router  to  keep  all  this  in- 
formation  will  severely  limit  scalability.  Especially, 
maintaining information on all DR-connections at, each 
router  is  impractical  because  the  required  amount  of 
information is O ( n  x average-path-length), where n is 
the  number  of  DR-connections.  Thus,  we  develop  a 
mechanism  that requires every router to maintain only 
abridged information.  We will revisit  this in Section  3. 
In  this  paper,  we  propose  three  routing  schemes  for 
DR-connections.

fined as 
0  SC,:  the  number  of  backups  on  L,  that  can  be 
activated successfully using the spare resources. 
2.2. DR-Connection Management 
To support the DR-connection service, every router 
is equipped with a DR-connection manager which con- 
sists  of  two  modules:  one  routes  backup  channels 
and  the  other  multiplexes  backups.  The  former  ex- 
changes  and  maintains  the  information  necessary  to 
select  backup  routes.  We  assume  that  a  portion  of 
network resources is set aside for DR-connections.  The 
total  amount  of  resources  for  DR-connections  cannot 
exceed  this  portion,  and  these  resources  can be  used 
for non-real-time traffic when they are not used by DR- 
connections. 
Management  of  each  DR-connection  consists of  the 
following four steps. 
1. Select a primary route and reserve resources when 
a client/server  node  requests  a DR-connection  to 
be set up. 
2.  Find a backup route after establishing the primary. 
3.  Send  a  backup-path  register  packet  along  the 
newly-selected path. 
4.  Release the  resources of  the primary  and backup 
routes when  the DR-connection is terminated. 
Every  router  maintains APLV  for  each  of  its  own 
links,  but  the  entire  APLVs  are  not  stored  in  each 
router's  link-state dat,abase. APLV  is used for routing 
and  multiplexing backups.  To  maintain  APLV  for  a 
link, a router needs  LSETs of  its P S E T .   Storing all 
LSETs may  require  large  memory  space,  because  an 
excessive  number  of  backup  channels  can  go  through 
a single high-speed  link.  To  cope  with  this  problem, 
when  a node  sets  up or releases  a backup  channel, it 
includes the LSET of  the corresponding primary route 
in  a  backup-path  register packet  and a  backup-path  re- 
lease  packet.  When  a router receives  a backup-setup 
request,  it  checks  the  amount  of  available  resources. 
The  router  registers  this  new  backup  in  the  backup 
channel table and updates APLV  for the link that the 
backup  channel  traverses  using  LSET.  Finally,  the 
router  forwards  the  request  to the  next  router in  the 
backup  path.  When  a  router  rejects  the  request  for 
setting up a backup channel, it sends a backup-release 
request  in  which  LSET  of  the corresponding primary 
route is included. 
3.  Link-State Routing Schemes 
A  node  can  select  a  backup  path  that  has  mini- 
mum conflicts, if  it has complete knowledge of APLVs 
for  all  the  links  in  the  network.  The  j t h   element 
of  APLV,  represents  the  number  of  DR-connections 
whose  backups  and  primaries  traverse  L, and  L,,  re- 
spectively.  In  Figure  1, we  have  PSET7  = { P I ,  ps}, 
LSETp,  = { L ~ , L I z , L I ~ } ,  
L S E T P ~  = {Ll,L3}, and 
APLV7  =  (O,O, O,O, O,O, 0,1,0,0,1,1,2).  APLV7  in- 
dicates  that  if  L7  is  selected  as  a link  of  the  backup 
route for a DR-connection whose primary channel goes 
through  L I Z ,  it  will  generate conflicts with  two  other 
backups.  ilPLV, represents  the number  and the posi- 
tions of backup conflicts that will occur when L, is used 
as a backup path link.  Thus, if  a node has knowledge 
of  all  APLVs in  the  network,  it  can  select  a backup 
path  that  will  create minimum  conflicts.  However, it 
is too costly for every node to acquire and maintain all 
APLVs, as there are N APLVs, each with N  integers. 
We therefore develop two link-state routing schemes 
that  use an abridged form of  APLV:  (1) P-LSR that 
infers  and exploits  the probability  of  backup conflicts 
using  IIAPLVIII  and  (2) D-LSR that uses  a bit-vector 
form  of  APLV, called  Conflacts  Vector, to decide  de- 
terministically  if  a link has backup conflicts. 
3.1.  P-LSR:  Probabilistic  Avoidance  of  Backup 
Conflicts 
The idea  behind  P-LSR  is  that  the  probability  of 
link La's backup conflicts rises as the number of links in 
PSET,, which  is equal to IIAPLV,II1, increases.  With- 
out knowing  where primary routes run, it is very  log- 
ical  to  select  a  link  with  smaller  llAPLVll1  to  min- 
imize  backup  conflicts  and  maximize  the  probability 
of  successful  backup  activation  on  L,. 
In  Figure  1, 
IIAPLV2111  = 0,  IIAPLV4111  = 2, and  IIAPLV7II1  = 5. 
As a link for a backup route, Lz  is preferable to L4  or 
L7. 
To  activate  a  backup,  B,,  on  L,  without  any 
conflict,  Pk  should  be  disjoint  from  all  the  primary 
routes  whose  backups  traverse  L,,  i.e.,  LSETpz n 
{UPJEPSET, LSETp,} = 0. Let q b ~ , , ~  denote the prob- 
ability of successful activation of Bk  on L,.  Then, 4~~ ,, 
can be calculated  as:

Since our goal is  to select  a backup route that  has 
the maximum probability of successfully activation, we 
need  to know  the  relation between  the  probability  of 
backup activation  and  links’  IlAPLVll  in  the  backup 
route.  The relation  can  be  derived  easily  as follows. 
Consider  a DR-connection  D, whose primary channel 
P,  has  already  been  established.  Our goal  is  then  to 
find  the  best  backup  route,  B,,  by  maximizing  the 
probability  of  successful  activation  upon  Px’s failure. 
The probability of  successfully  activating B, , denoted 
by  @ E = ,  can be calculated by 
L , E L  S ETB, 
Since the log  function is  monotonic, maximizing  @E* 
is equivalent  to maximizing log @B= where

(JAPLV(I1 and the available bandwidth  (the sum of 
the un-allocated bandwidth  and  the  spare bandwidth 
shared by the backup channels) are stored in each link- 
state database.  To select a backup path after establish- 
ing a primary channel, a router  assigns Ci as the cost 
of  link Li, and chooses a minimum-cost  path using the 
Dijkstra’s algorithm, where

3.2.  D-LSR:  Deterministic  Avoidance of  Backup 
Conflicts Using Conflict-Vector 
APLV  contains information on the number and po- 
sition  of  backup conflicts.  D-LSR  uses  a simple  data 
structure, Conflzct- Vector (CV), which shows only the 
location  of  backup  conflicts.  The CV  of  link  L,,  de- 
noted by  CV,, is an N-element  bit-vector, the j L h  ele- 
ment  of  which,  c,,,,  is  1 if  the j t h  element  of  APLV,, 
a,,,  > 0; 0  otherwise.  Thus,  c,,,  = 1 if  and  only  if 
there is at least one primary channel  running through 
L,  whose  backup traverses L,. 
Figure  2  shows  a  simple  example  with  two  DR- 
connections  D1  and D2.  Since  both backup channels, 
B1  and B2, go through  L6, PSET6  = { P I ,  P2). From 
LSETp, and LSETp,, one can easily compute APL& 
and cV6  = (1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1). The c v s  for 
the other links can be computed similarly. 
After  establishing a primary  channel  P,,  the  node 
can  use  CV,  and  LSETp= to  check  if  L,  creates 
backup conflicts  in  order  to choose  a link  for  backup. 
If  L,  E  LSETpz  and  c,,,  =  1, L,  will  introduce 
backup conflicts.  Thus, the node selects  L, such that 
To  choose  a  backup 
route with  minimum  conflicts  while  meeting the  &OS 
requirement, the node assigns L, the link  cost  C, and 
selects the minimum-cost  route using the Dijkstra’s al- 
gorithm, where 
c,,,  is  minimum. 
Q is a very large constant (> maz(APLV,)) if  P,  tra- 
verses Li or the available bandwidth is smaller than the 
QoS requirement,  0  otherwise.  A  small  positive con- 
stant, E  (< l), is used to select the shortest route as the 
backup path if  there are several candidate routes with 
the  same degree  of  channel  overlapping.  The result- 
ing path  will  be the shortest backup route that meets 
the  QoS requirement, minimally  overlaps with  its cor- 
responding primary channel  route, and maximizes  the 
probability  of  successful activation.

Q and E  are added for the same reason as in P-LSR. In 
D-LSR,  CVs  and  the available  bandwidths are stored 
in the link-state database. 
Consider  the  example  network  in  Figure  3,  where 
two  DR-connections  are  established  and  node  8  se- 
lects  the  backup  for  0 3  whose  primary  is  running 
through  L13 and  Lll.  Suppose  that  the  links  have 
enough  bandwidths  available  to provide  the  required 
&OS. (Lg, Lq, L2, L5) is selected  as the backup channel

route, B3+, of the DR-connection.  Note that if  L13  fails, 
both connections a and c fail simultaneously.  However, 
since the backup  routes  are disjoint, both  connections 
can recover from the link failure.  In Figure 1, B3+ offers 
better fault-tolerance than BS, although it has a longer 
distance. 
other distance metric can be used.  The distance table 
at node i is a 2-dimensional matrix containing, for each 
destination j  and for each neighbor  IC  E  N B i ,  the min- 
imum  hop  count  from  i  to j  via  k, which  is  denoted 
by  D;,k:  So,  the  minimum  distance  from  node  i  to 
destination j  is
