## Question
version : ShardingSphere-JDBC 5.1.0
According to the logic of ShardingSphere, the query condition has no sharding
field and the routing engine will use the Cartesian product for it.  
Now we have the following SQL:  
SQL1: select a.id ,a.time,b.id from photo a left join alarm_photo b on
a.alarm_id = b.id  
Logic Table photo has two actual tables: photo_202201,photo_202203 , two
months has one actual table;  
Logic Table alarm_photo has three actual tables:
alarm_photo_202201,alarm_photo_202202,alarm_photo_202203, one months has one
acutal table;  
Logic table photo has one data :[ id：1、date:'20220201' ]、and the data is in
actual table photo_202201  
Logic alarm_photo has no data.  
Now I execute the above SQL1(left join ! not right join)、and get the three
results:  
[id:1,time:'20220201', id null],[id:1,time:'20220201', id
null],[id:1,time:'20220201', id null]
This is not what I expected, I think there should be only one data.  
Why is this, I know it's caused by the Cartesian product, but why doesn't
ShardingSphere solve this problem?  
Can you give me an answer ？thanks.
