Subject: Error Compiling LESS Files - Assistance Needed

Dear Support Team,

I am new to using LESS and have encountered an issue while attempting to compile my LESS files. Specifically, I receive an error message pointing to line 578 in the mixins file. Could you provide some guidance or suggestions on what might be causing this problem?

Thank you for your time and assistance.

Best regards,  
Andy
