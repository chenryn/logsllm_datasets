User: I have developed a python application with 64-bit Windows 8 (the non metro version which looks like Windows 7 interface). I want to distribute it to all version of 64-bit Windows such as Windows XP, Windows 7 and etc. Is it possible for program developed with python to do that? Also, can the software run on 32-bit Windows os as well?
Assistant: Well-written pure Python programs (just .py files) are extraordinarily portable across all platforms.  If you're using some way of packaging your program in a Windows executable (.exe file), then you have worlds of other possible problems.
There are cases where a 64-bit program won't work on a 32-bit system, such as if your program uses massive data structures and you simply run out of address space on a 32-bit system.  But, barring things like that, you should be fine.
If you want more specifics, I'm afraid you'll need to be more specific ;-)
