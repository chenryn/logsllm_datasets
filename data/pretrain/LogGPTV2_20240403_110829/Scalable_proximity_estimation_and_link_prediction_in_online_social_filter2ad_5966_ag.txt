This is useful when we want to further classify possible friendship
candidates with the same shortest path distance. Since the shortest
path distance is integer-valued and is typically very small in social
networks (due to the small-world effect [27]), it yields only coarse-
grained control (e.g., depending on whether the threshold is 2 or 3
hops, a large number of node pairs will be classiﬁed as positive or
negative at the same time).
5. RELATED WORK
Social networks. Traditional social networks have been widely
studied by sociologists. Refer to [52] for a detailed review. Social
networks have also found a wide range of applications in business
(e.g., viral marketing [23], fraud detection [11]), information tech-
nology (e.g., improving Internet search [35]), computer networks
(e.g., overlay network construction [45]), and cyber security (e.g.,
email spam mitigation [22], identity veriﬁcation [56]).
The explosive growth of online social networks has attracted
signiﬁcant attention [2, 3, 5, 37].
In particular, [3, 37] have con-
ducted in-depth measurement-based studies of several online so-
cial networks and report the power-law, small-world, and scale-free
properties of online social networks. Different from these studies,
which analyze the general network topological structure, we focus
on scalable proximity estimation and link prediction in online so-
cial networks.
Proximity measures. There is a rich body of literature on proxim-
ity measures (e.g., [1,26,28,30,31,38,47,48,50]). For example, [50]
proposes escape probability as a useful measure of direction-aware
proximity, which is closely related the rooted PageRank we con-
sider. But their technique for computing escape probability can
only scale to networks with tens of thousands of nodes. Recent
works on proximity measures (e.g., [28, 48]) either dismiss path-
ensemble based proximity measures due to their high computa-
tional cost or leave it as future work to compare with them.
Link prediction. [30, 31] ﬁrst deﬁne the link prediction problem
for social networks. To predict links, they calculate ten proximity
measures between node pairs of the graph. The nodes are ranked
based on their scores, where node pairs with higher score are more
likely to form a link. They measure the effectiveness of the dif-
ferent proximity measures in predicting links in ﬁve co-authorship
networks. However, they are limited to relatively small networks
with only about 5000 nodes. Moreover, they do not combine dif-
ferent measures to gain better link prediction accuracy.
Dimensionality reduction. A variety of dimensionality reduction
techniques have been developed in the area of data stream compu-
tation (see [39] for a detailed survey). One powerful technique is
sketch [9, 10, 24, 29], a probabilistic summary technique proposed
for analyzing large streaming datasets. Sketches achieves dimen-
sionality reduction using projections along random vectors. Our
proximity sketch is closely related to the count-min sketch [10].

Figure 10: Examples of decision trees for link prediction
In computer networking, Ng and Zhang [43] propose the ﬁrst
network embedding technique, called Global Network Positioning
(GNP), to infer end-to-end delay by embedding network delay in
a low-dimensional Euclidean space. Several enhancements have
been proposed since then [32, 34, 49]. In particular, [34] applies
matrix factorization and can handle path asymmetry and violation
of triangulation. To our knowledge, all these techniques have only
been applied to networks with a few thousand nodes. Moreover,
proximity is the opposite of distance — the lower the distance the
higher the proximity. Thus, techniques for network distance em-
bedding may not work well for proximity embedding.
port. We then conduct extensive experiments on the effectiveness
of a variety of proximity measures for predicting links in ﬁve pop-
ular online social networks. Our key new ﬁndings include: (i) the
effectiveness of different proximity measures varies signiﬁcantly
across different networks and heavily depends on the fraction of
edges contributed by the highest degree nodes, and (ii) combining
multiple proximity measures consistently yields the best accuracy.
In the future, we plan to leverage the insights we gain in this paper
to design better proximity measures and more accurate link predic-
tion algorithms.
6. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we develop several novel techniques to approxi-
mate a large family of proximity measures in massive, highly dy-
namic online social networks. Our techniques are accurate and can
easily handle networks with millions of nodes, which are several
orders of magnitude larger than what existing methods can sup-
