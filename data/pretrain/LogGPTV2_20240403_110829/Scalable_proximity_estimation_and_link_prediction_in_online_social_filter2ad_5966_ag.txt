### 4. Further Classification of Friendship Candidates

When classifying potential friendship candidates with the same shortest path distance, additional criteria can be useful. The shortest path distance in social networks is typically an integer and often very small due to the small-world effect [27]. This results in a coarse-grained control, where a large number of node pairs may be classified as positive or negative simultaneously, depending on whether the threshold is set at 2 or 3 hops.

#### Social Networks
Traditional social networks have been extensively studied by sociologists, with a detailed review provided in [52]. These networks have found applications in various fields, including business (e.g., viral marketing [23], fraud detection [11]), information technology (e.g., improving Internet search [35]), computer networks (e.g., overlay network construction [45]), and cybersecurity (e.g., email spam mitigation [22], identity verification [56]).

The rapid growth of online social networks has attracted significant attention [2, 3, 5, 37]. Studies such as [3, 37] have conducted in-depth, measurement-based analyses of several online social networks, reporting power-law, small-world, and scale-free properties. Unlike these studies, which focus on general network topological structure, our work emphasizes scalable proximity estimation and link prediction in online social networks.

#### Proximity Measures
There is a rich body of literature on proximity measures, including works such as [1, 26, 28, 30, 31, 38, 47, 48, 50]. For example, [50] proposes escape probability as a measure of direction-aware proximity, closely related to the rooted PageRank we consider. However, their technique for computing escape probability is limited to networks with tens of thousands of nodes. Recent works on proximity measures, such as [28, 48], either dismiss path-ensemble based proximity measures due to their high computational cost or leave it as future work to compare with them.

#### Link Prediction
[30, 31] first defined the link prediction problem for social networks. They calculate ten proximity measures between node pairs and rank nodes based on their scores, with higher scores indicating a higher likelihood of forming a link. They evaluate the effectiveness of different proximity measures in predicting links in five co-authorship networks. However, their approach is limited to relatively small networks with about 5,000 nodes and does not combine different measures to improve link prediction accuracy.

#### Dimensionality Reduction
Various dimensionality reduction techniques have been developed in the area of data stream computation, as detailed in [39]. One powerful technique is sketching [9, 10, 24, 29], a probabilistic summary method for analyzing large streaming datasets. Sketches achieve dimensionality reduction using projections along random vectors. Our proximity sketch is closely related to the count-min sketch [10].

### 6. Conclusions

In this paper, we develop several novel techniques to approximate a wide range of proximity measures in massive, highly dynamic online social networks. Our techniques are accurate and can handle networks with millions of nodes, significantly larger than what existing methods can support. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of various proximity measures for link prediction in five popular online social networks. Our key findings include: (i) the effectiveness of different proximity measures varies significantly across different networks and depends heavily on the fraction of edges contributed by the highest degree nodes, and (ii) combining multiple proximity measures consistently yields the best accuracy. In future work, we plan to leverage these insights to design better proximity measures and more accurate link prediction algorithms.
