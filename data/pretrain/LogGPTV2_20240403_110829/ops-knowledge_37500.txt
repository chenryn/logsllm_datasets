User: I have divided celery into following parts

Celery
Celery worker
Celery daemon
Broker: Rabbimq or SQS
Queue
Result backend
Celery monitor (Flower)

My Understanding

When i hit celery task in django e,g  tasks.add(1,2). Then celery adds that task to queue. I am confused if thats 4 or 5 in above list
WHen task goes to queue Then worker gets that task and delete from queue
The result of that task is saved in Result Backend

My Confusions

Whats diff between celery daemon and celery worker
Is Rabbitmq doing the work of queue. Does it means tasks gets saved in Rabitmq or SQS
What does flower do . does it monitor workers or tasks or queues or resulst
Assistant: First, just to explain how it works briefly. You have a celery client running in your code. You call tasks.add(1,2) and a new Celery Task is created. That task is transferred by the Broker to the queue. Yes the queue is persisted in Rabbimq or SQS. The Celery Daemon is always running and is listening for new tasks. When there is a new task in the queue, it starts a new Celery Worker to perform the work.
To answer your questions:

Celery daemon is always running and it's starting celery workers.
Yes Rabitmq or SQS is doing the work of a queue. 
With the celery monitor you can monitor how many tasks are running, how many are completed, what is the size of the queue, etc.
