- New tools and fun techniques.
- Real-world tested methods.

### What Do We Cover?
- Target profiling.
- Discovery tools and techniques.
- Exploitation.
- Gaining remote access.

## The Tactical Approach
- **Vulnerabilities are transient.**
  - Target the applications, processes, people, and trusts.
  - You will gain access.
- **Crackers are opportunists.**
  - Expand the scope of your tests.
  - Everything is fair game.
  - If you don't test it, someone else will.
- **Hacking is not just about exploits.**
  - The target is the data, not root.
  - Use what you have: passwords, trust relationships, service hijacking, and auth tickets.

## Personnel Discovery
- **Security is a people problem.**
  - People write your software and secure your network.
  - Identify the "meatware" first.
- **Tools for Identifying Personnel:**
  - Google, newsgroups, SensePost tools, Paterva.com.
  - These tools provide full names, usernames, email addresses, employment history, phone numbers, and personal sites.
- **Case Study:**
  - Started with only the company name and function.
  - Found an online personnel directory.
  - Identified people and email addresses.
  - Email name = username = target.
- **Demo:**

## Network Discovery
- **Identify your target assets.**
  - Find unknown networks and third-party hosts.
  - Use less-known tools.
- **Overused Tools:**
  - Whois, Google, zone transfers, reverse DNS lookups.
- **Newer Tools:**
  - CentralOps.net, DigitalPoint.com, DomainTools.com, Paterva.com.
- **What Does This Get Us?**
  - Proxied DNS probes, virtual host lists, port scans, traceroutes, and a gold mine of related information.
- **Active Discovery Techniques:**
  - Trigger SMTP bounces, brute force HTTP vhosts, watch outbound DNS, and email users.
- **Case Study:**
- **Demo:**

## Firewalls and IPS
- **Firewalls and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)**
  - Content filtering and intrusion prevention are common.
  - Identify and fingerprint these systems.
  - Increase stealthiness and customize your exploits.
- **Firewall Identification:**
  - NAT device source port ranges, handling of interesting TCP.
- **IPS Identification:**
  - Use "drop with no alert" signatures.
  - Traverse signature trees to find the vendor.
- **Case Study:**
- **Demo:**

## Application Discovery
- **Applications are the entry points.**
  - Finding these apps is the key.
- **Tools for Application Discovery:**
  - Nmap, Amap, Nikto, Nessus, and commercial tools.
- **Slow and Steady Wins the Deface:**
  - Scan for specific ports slowly to avoid detection.
- **Example:**
  - Standard nmap lit up IDS, but a slow scan on one port was undetected.
- **New Tools:**
  - W3AF for web apps, Metasploit 3 includes scanners.
- **Case Study:**
- **Demo:**

## Client Application Discovery
- **Client applications are often exploitable.**
  - Easy to fingerprint remotely.
- **Common Probe Methods:**
  - Mail links, exposed web logs, MDNs, and abuse all, everyone, team aliases.
- **Existing Tools:**
  - BEEF for browser fun.
- **New Tools:**
  - Metasploit 3 SMTP/HTTP, SMB services.
- **Case Study:**
- **Demo:**

## Process Discovery
- **Track what your target does.**
  - Activity via IP ID counters, last-modified headers, FTP server statistics.
- **Look for Patterns:**
  - Large IP ID increments at night, FTP stats at certain times, web pages being uploaded.
- **Tools:**
  - None available, but Metasploit 3 profiling modules can help.
- **Case Study:**
- **Demo:**

## 15 Minute Break
- **Come back for the exploits!**

## Re-Introduction
- **In Our Last Session:**
  - Discovery techniques and tools.
- **In This Session:**
  - Compromising systems!

## External Network
- **The Exposed Hosts and Services:**
  - VPN and proxy services, client-initiated sessions.

## Attacking File Transfers
- **FTP Transfers:**
  - Active and passive FTP, NFS, TFTP.

## Attacking Mail Services
- **Four Different Attack Points:**
  - Mail relay servers, antivirus gateways, real mail servers, and user mail clients.
- **File Name Clobbering:**

## Attacking Web Servers
- **Brute Force Files and Directories:**
  - Virtual hosts, standard application flaws, load balancer fun, clueless users, and cgi-bin vulnerabilities.

## Attacking DNS Servers
- **Brute Force Host Name Entries:**
  - Internal hosts, XID sequence analysis, return extra answers.

## Attacking DB Servers
- **Well-Known User/Pass Combos:**
  - Business apps hardcode auth, features available to anonymous, no-patch bugs (DB2, Ingres, etc).

## Authentication Relays
- **SMB/CIFS Clients:**
  - Steal hashes, redirect, MITM, NTLM relay between protocols (SMB/HTTP/SMTP/POP3/IMAP).

## Social Engineering
- **Give Away Free Toys:**
  - CDROMs, USB keys, N800s, replace UPS with OpenWRT.

## Internal Network
- **The Soft Chewy Center:**
  - Easy to trick clients.

## File Services
- **SMB and AFP:**
  - NAS storage devices, rarely patched Samba.
- **NFS:**
  - Port 111/2049, showmount -e/-a, exported NFS home directories.
- **Software Distribution Servers:**
  - Write to software distro directories, trojan every node at once.
- **Case Study:**

## NetBIOS Services
- **NetBIOS Names:**
  - WPAD, ISASRV, CALICENSE.

## DNS Services
- **Microsoft DNS + DHCP:**
  - Inject and overwrite DNS, hijack the entire network, impersonate servers.

## WINS Services
- **Advertise Your WINS Service:**
  - Control name lookups, attack other client apps.

## License Servers
- **A Soft Spot in Desktop Apps:**
  - Computer Associates, FlexLM network services.

## Remote Desktops
- **RDP:**
  - Great for gathering other targets, domain lists available pre-auth.
- **VNC:**
  - Authentication bug, MITM attacks, vncinject payloads.

## Trust Relationships
- **Target Unavailability:**
  - Networks often trust each other.

## Case Studies
- **Trust Relationships:**
- **Hijacking SSH:**
- **Hijacking Kerberos:**
- **Hijacking NTLM:**

## Conclusion
- **Compromise a Patched Network:**
  - Determination and creativity win.
  - Lots of new pen-test tools.
  - The best tool is still YOU!
