A ABILITY TO REACH SE ATTACKS VIA
MULTIPLE WEB PAGES
In addition to the evaluation discussed in Section 4.4, we examined
the ability of each web-crawling module to visit SE attacks that can
be reached via multiple web pages. Table 11 shows the number of
unique domain names observed at each depth. Note that each depth
may have duplicate domains because the web-crawling modules
visited the same domains at different depths. Also, the number of
domain names observed at a depth of 1 was the same because each
module visited the same landing pages. The number of domains of
SE pages show that StraySheep’s web-crawling module efficiently
visited more domains of SE attacks at every depth than the baseline
modules. As the depth became deeper, the percentages of an SE
page’s domains that ElementCrawler and LinkCrawler detected
decreased. On the contrary, the percentages of an SE page’s do-
mains that StraySheep’s web-crawling module visited were 5.5%
at a depth of 2, 6.3% at a depth of 3, and 9.4% at a depth of 4;
thus, the deeper StraySheep’s web-crawling module crawled, the
more it efficiently visited SE pages. As described in Section 3.2.1,
StraySheep selects lure elements that lead to SE attacks so that
the web-crawling module can reach more of an SE page’s domains
even though it crawls deeper.
B NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE OF SE
ATTACKS
To clarify the network infrastructures of SE attacks analyzed in
Section 5.2, we investigated duplication of IP addresses associated
with different domain names and the geographical distribution of
the IP addresses.
IP Addresses Used for SE Attacks To analyze the relationship
between each SE page’s domain name, we leveraged DNSDB. The
DNSDB enables us to find IP addresses historically associated with
domain names. If the same IP address is set in the A record of
different domain names, we assume that these domain names are
related. As a result of investigating the 1,404 domain names, we
detected a total of 96,544 IP addresses associated with 1,349 do-
main names (55 domain names were not found in the DNSDB).
Note that multiple IP addresses were associated with one domain
name; thus, there are more IP addresses than domain names. We
found that 29.6% (28,617/96,544) of IP addresses were shared among
more than two domain names we detected, and these IP addresses

(28,617) were associated with 39.5% (554/1,404) of domain names.
The 554 domain names were mainly used for multimedia scams,
PUP/malware distributions, survey scams, and unwanted browser
extension installs. We now focus on 94 multimedia scam domains
and their corresponding 20,589 IP addresses. We found that 87.8%
(18,086/20,589) IP addresses were shared among more than two
multimedia scam domains. One of these IP addresses was shared
with 84 multimedia scam domains we detected.
Geographical Attribution We analyzed the geographical attribu-
tion of IP addresses used for SE attacks. We used the same 96,544
IP addresses as the above analysis. We queried GeoIP2 Databases 4
for the country and Autonomous system (AS) information associ-
ated with the IP addresses. Table 12 shows top 10 countries whose
IP addresses were used for distributing SE attacks. United States
accounted for 72.9% of all IP addresses, Thailand for 2.3%, Mexico
for 1.9%, and Vietnam for 1.9%. Table 13 shows the top 10 ASes. We
confirmed CDNs and cloud hosting providers are frequently abused
for SE attacks. Amazon, Google, and Cloudflare accounted for 50.5,
7.6, and 2.9%.

web pages suggest users to register for free membership to obtain
movies, music, or games. When users are tricked to input their
credit card numbers, the web pages fraudulently charge them.
