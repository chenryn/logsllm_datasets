### Ability to Reach SE Attacks via Multiple Web Pages

In addition to the evaluation discussed in Section 4.4, we examined the ability of each web-crawling module to visit SE attacks that can be reached via multiple web pages. Table 11 shows the number of unique domain names observed at each depth. Note that each depth may have duplicate domains because the web-crawling modules visited the same domains at different depths. Additionally, the number of domain names observed at a depth of 1 was the same because each module visited the same landing pages. The data in Table 11 indicate that StraySheep’s web-crawling module efficiently visited more domains of SE attacks at every depth compared to the baseline modules. As the depth increased, the percentages of SE page domains detected by ElementCrawler and LinkCrawler decreased. Conversely, the percentages of SE page domains visited by StraySheep’s web-crawling module were 5.5% at a depth of 2, 6.3% at a depth of 3, and 9.4% at a depth of 4. This suggests that as StraySheep’s web-crawling module delves deeper, it becomes more efficient at visiting SE pages. As described in Section 3.2.1, StraySheep selects lure elements that lead to SE attacks, allowing the web-crawling module to reach more SE page domains even when crawling deeper.

### Network Infrastructure of SE Attacks

To clarify the network infrastructures of SE attacks analyzed in Section 5.2, we investigated the duplication of IP addresses associated with different domain names and the geographical distribution of these IP addresses.

#### IP Addresses Used for SE Attacks

To analyze the relationship between each SE page’s domain name, we used DNSDB, which allows us to find IP addresses historically associated with domain names. If the same IP address is set in the A record of different domain names, we assume that these domain names are related. After investigating 1,404 domain names, we detected a total of 96,544 IP addresses associated with 1,349 domain names (55 domain names were not found in the DNSDB). Note that multiple IP addresses were associated with one domain name, resulting in more IP addresses than domain names. We found that 29.6% (28,617/96,544) of IP addresses were shared among more than two domain names, and these IP addresses were associated with 39.5% (554/1,404) of domain names. These 554 domain names were primarily used for multimedia scams, PUP/malware distributions, survey scams, and unwanted browser extension installs. Focusing on 94 multimedia scam domains and their corresponding 20,589 IP addresses, we found that 87.8% (18,086/20,589) of IP addresses were shared among more than two multimedia scam domains. One of these IP addresses was shared with 84 multimedia scam domains.

#### Geographical Attribution

We analyzed the geographical attribution of IP addresses used for SE attacks using the same 96,544 IP addresses. We queried GeoIP2 Databases for the country and Autonomous System (AS) information associated with the IP addresses. Table 12 shows the top 10 countries whose IP addresses were used for distributing SE attacks. The United States accounted for 72.9% of all IP addresses, followed by Thailand (2.3%), Mexico (1.9%), and Vietnam (1.9%). Table 13 shows the top 10 ASes, confirming that Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) and cloud hosting providers are frequently abused for SE attacks. Amazon, Google, and Cloudflare accounted for 50.5%, 7.6%, and 2.9%, respectively.

### Examples of SE Attacks

Figure 8 shows examples of malware-distribution pages with similar designs described in Section 5.1. These web pages instruct users to change the filenames of downloaded binaries and execute them. Figure 9 illustrates examples of multimedia scams, where web pages suggest users register for free membership to obtain movies, music, or games. When users are tricked into inputting their credit card numbers, the web pages fraudulently charge them.
