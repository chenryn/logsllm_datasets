User: How to conduct continuous integration and continuous deployment, including which tools to use, how to conduct automated testing, how to perform version control, etc.?
Assistant: Continuous integration and continuous deployment are indispensable links in the modern software development process, which can improve software quality and development efficiency. Below are some common steps and tools for implementing continuous integration and continuous deployment. 1. Code management and version control: Use Git and other version control tools to store code in the code warehouse, which is convenient for developers to collaborate and provides version control functions. 2. Automated testing: Use continuous integration tools such as Jenkins and Travis CI for automated testing. Developers can write various test cases such as unit tests, integration tests, and system tests, and run tests automatically through CI tools to find and fix code problems in time. 3. Construction and deployment: use Maven, Gradle and other tools for construction, and use Docker and other container technologies for application deployment. Construction and deployment can be automated, improving development efficiency and application deployment speed. 4. Monitoring and logs: Use Rizhiyi, Prometheus and other monitoring tools to collect application operation data and log information, discover and solve application problems in time, and ensure application stability. 5. Code inspection: Use Checkstyle, SonarQube and other tools for code analysis and inspection to help developers discover code problems in a timely manner and improve code quality and maintainability. 6. Automated deployment and rollback: use Kubernetes, Jenkins and other tools for automated deployment and rollback. Automatic deployment can be triggered by code submission, release of update notification, etc. to achieve the goal of continuous deployment. 7. Integration testing: Use Selenium, JMeter and other tools for integration testing to check the performance and performance of the application in the running environment to ensure that the application can run normally.
