## I. Motivation and Key Insights

Robotic Vehicles (RVs) rely on sensors to measure their physical states and generate appropriate actuator signals for autonomous navigation and control operations. However, attackers can manipulate these signals through various means, such as malicious code injection [2], sensor spoofing [7], and acoustic noise injection [6].

Recent research has proposed model-based techniques to detect attacks against RVs. These include Control Invariants (CI) [3] and Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) [1], which use control-based estimations to derive invariants and monitor the RV's runtime behavior to detect anomalies. In this paper, we demonstrate three stealthy attacks—false data injection (FDI), artificial delay (AD), and switch mode (SM)—based on our previous work [4], [5]. These attacks evade CI and EKF detection, leading to significant adverse impacts on the RV's mission, such as substantial deviations from the target or crashes.

Our key insight is that CI and EKF techniques are designed to tolerate some deviation from the planned trajectory due to environmental factors like wind or sensor noise. This tolerance is achieved by setting a threshold for flagging errors between model estimations and observed behavior as attacks. Additionally, we found that control-based estimation techniques often fail to accurately model the RV's runtime behavior. As a result, CI and EKF techniques set high thresholds and perform stateless analysis to avoid false alarms. This opens new vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to launch stealthy sensor and actuator attacks.

- **False Data Injection (FDI) Attack**: Injects bias values into sensor and actuator measurements, ensuring that deviations in the control output (e.g., Euler angles, motor rotation rates) remain below the detection threshold.
- **Artificial Delay (AD) Attack**: Introduces intermittent delays in the reception of gyroscopic sensor measurements, influencing the estimation of the RV's angular orientation while evading detection.
- **Switch Mode (SM) Attack**: Injects strong bias values into actuators when the RV switches modes of operation (e.g., from steady flight to landing). Over a prolonged duration, these attacks can cause mission failure or significantly degrade the RV's performance.

Autonomous RVs are deployed in various industrial sectors, including agriculture and package delivery. They are also projected for mission-critical tasks such as drug delivery and disaster relief. Therefore, it is crucial to protect RVs from attacks to ensure optimal performance and prevent adverse consequences. Our findings highlight that using inaccurate models for invariant analysis in non-linear RV systems can introduce new vulnerabilities.

## II. Attack Impact

We conducted experiments on six RVs, including three real vehicles (two drones and one rover), in the presence of both CI and EKF techniques. Our results show that the stealthy attacks can cause severe disruptions in RV missions while remaining undetected:

- **False Data Injection (FDI) Attack**: Deviated RVs by 8 to 15 meters from their target in short missions (50 meters) and by more than 160 meters in long missions (5 kilometers).
- **Artificial Delay (AD) Attack**: Increased the mission duration of a rover by more than 65% and a drone by over 30%.
- **Switch Mode (SM) Attack**: Resulted in a crash in more than 50% of the cases during drone missions when launched at vulnerable states.
