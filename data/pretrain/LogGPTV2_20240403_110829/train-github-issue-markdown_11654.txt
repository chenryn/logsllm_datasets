### Describe the issue:
Suppose we have an array whose total size is zero (product of `shape[i]` is
zero) but the `shape != (0,)`. Below, I'm making one by slicing a non-empty
array.
    >>> array = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
    >>> array
    array([[1, 2, 3],
           [4, 5, 6]])
    >>> array.tolist()
    [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
    >>> array[:, :0]
    array([], shape=(2, 0), dtype=int64)
    >>> array[:, :0].tolist()
    [[], []]
The `repr` looks like `[]`, but I would expect it to be `[[], []]`, as the
list representation is. This is minor, but I thought I'd point it out.
I also didn't see anything like it in the current open issues.
### Reproduce the code example:
    See above.
### Error message:
    No error message.
