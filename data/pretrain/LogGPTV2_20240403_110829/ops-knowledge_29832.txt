User: quick question that I'm never even sure is possible :3
I have a python script, a network script that connects to a server and remains connected until I either disconnect or it kicks me (which it normally shouldn't), which is constantly receiving data and doing other tasks.
I was curious if it's at all possible while the script is running, to trigger functions from within the script?  Say  while the script was running, if I had the urge to send some sort of data to the server, I could type it up and send it to the function that handles this?
Wasn't quite sure if it was possible or not, as I've never had to attempt or even seen it done.  If it helps, I'm on Ubuntu linux running the script from the terminal.
Assistant: Stick your server stuff in another thread (investigate the threading module) and use the main thread for interaction with the user via raw_input/input.
