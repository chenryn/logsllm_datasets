**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Password Policies

**Description:**
To ensure the security and integrity of password policies, it is essential to validate that only authorized password filters are registered. These filter DLLs must be located in the Windows installation directory, typically `C:\Windows\System32\`, on both domain controllers and local computers. Additionally, there should be a corresponding entry for each filter in the following registry key:

```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\Notification Packages
```

This ensures that only legitimate and approved password filters are in use, thereby enhancing the overall security of the system.
