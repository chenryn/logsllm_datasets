User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Exploring various Hypervisor solutions for small scale deployment I've been looking at various virtualization products such as KVM, XEN, Virtualbox, Open stack and Eucalyptus.  

KVM, XEN, and Virtualbox seem to be easy to use and so far to me make the most sense to deploy small scale.  

I'm wondering if it's worth the cycles to learn OpenStack or Eucalyptus.  

I've been told that you need a team of developers to deploy OpenStack in a production environment, but this is for a small startup with only 1 system 4 CPUs with 16GB of memory (1 or 2 more systems will be added in 4th quarter).  

I can see if the business grew to the point where I had to manage many servers something like OpenStack would be needed. 

I found the features of OpenSTack are very nice such as a user having a project to create and manage their own vms.  

I think a feature like this is much needed for some of my clients. Is there something else I should be looking at?  

I would like my clients to be able to log in via web and be able to manage their vm. Keep in mind I'm the only administrator on this project. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Assistant: I'd go for VMware ESXi, and then when you expand, you can start to look at VMware vCenter, and their vCloud tool suite (some of which can be used to give your customers control over their own VM).  

The entire tool suite includes stuff to manage resource usage by your customers' VMs, so you can bill them accordingly.

OpenStack is nice, but as HopelessN00b says, it's not worth it unless you're MASSIVE, and even then...

VirtualBox just plain sucks.
