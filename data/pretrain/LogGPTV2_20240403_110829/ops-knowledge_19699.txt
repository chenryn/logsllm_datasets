User: I want to give my python program to some people, and they will run this in Linux. What is the best way to do this ? Is it better to give them every script - I have 5 of them, or make it into an installer like *.deb
Thank you.
Assistant: If you know a little of C/C++, you could make a tiny C/C++ program which kinda Glues all your python scripts together and packs the Python interpreter with it making a pretty presentable executable. Google "Embedding python scripts into a C/C++ application" and look for the CPython Api reference in your python docs.
