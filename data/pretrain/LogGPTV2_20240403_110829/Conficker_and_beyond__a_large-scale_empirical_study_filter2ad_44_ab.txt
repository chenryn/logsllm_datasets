### Network and AS Analysis

The 123.19.* network is one of several assigned to Vietnam Post and Telecom Corporation, with the IP range 123.19.0.0 - 123.19.255.255.

### Representing Conficker-Infected Hosts by IP Address

Using IP addresses to identify Conficker-infected hosts provides precise and detailed information. However, the large number of infected IP addresses makes it challenging to grasp the global picture. Therefore, we use Autonomous Systems (ASes) to cluster the infected hosts. ASes are a useful method for grouping hosts on the Internet, facilitating easier management and analysis. This approach has been used in previous studies.

### Result 2: Distribution over ASes

- The top two ASes account for 28.37% of all Conficker victims.
- The top 20 ASes cover 52.54% of all victims.
- Most of the highly infected ASes are located in Asia, particularly in China.

### Result 2.1: Comparison with Previous Botnets

- The top two ASes were also sources of previous botnets, but most other high-ranking ASes are new in the Conficker case.
- Previous studies [18, 31, 32] found that major botnet sources were in North America, particularly the USA, and later spread globally.
- In the Conficker case, ASes in the USA are no longer in the top 20, with most highly infected ASes now in Asia and South America.
- Four ASes in Conficker are not seen in previous results, including two in Asia (Vietnam and India) and two in South America (Brazil).

### Insight from Results 2 and 2.1

- The trend of major botnet locations has shifted from North America to Asia and South America.
- New malware spreading models and defense strategies may be needed to address this changing trend.

### 4.2 Distribution Over Domain Names

We use DNS reverse lookup to inspect the domain names of each victim. Domain names can reveal the group to which a host belongs and are expressed in easy-to-understand words.

### Result 3: Distribution over Domain Names

- The .br, .net, and .cn domains cover approximately 24.42% of Conficker victims.
- One third-level domain, 163data.com.cn, covers around 7% of infected hosts, indicating more than 1,700,000 victims.
- Many victims in 163data.com.cn have "dynamic" in their fourth-level domain names, suggesting they use dynamic IP addresses.

### Result 3.1: Comparison with Previous Work

- The .net domain remains prevalent, but new domains like .br, .cn, and .ru have emerged as significant sources of botnets.
- Previously, .com and .edu domains were major sources of worms, but they are now relatively clean.
- Newly seen ccTLDs (Country Code Top Level Domains) such as .cn, .ru, .in, and .mx have increased registration rates, implying a higher number of potentially vulnerable hosts.
- The coverage of .com and .edu domains in Conficker infections has decreased to 1.21% and 0.0096%, respectively, suggesting better management and protection.

### Result 3.2: Sensitive Domain Names

- There are Conficker victims in government networks and Fortune 100 companies, although the number of infected hosts is small.
