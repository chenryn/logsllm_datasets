to several network providers. The 123.19.* network is one
of them and it is assigned to VietNam Post and Telecom
Coorperation and its inetnum is 123.19.0.0 - 123.19.255.255.
Representing identities of Conﬁcker-infected hosts by IP
address is often preferable in a way that it is precise and
elaborate. However, the number of the infected IP addresses
is so large that this makes it hard to grasp the global view
of Conﬁcker victims. Hence, we use the Autonomous Sys-
tem (AS), which is a useful method for clustering hosts on
the Internet for easier management and has been applied in
previous measurement work, to group the hosts infected by
Conﬁcker.
Result 2. (Distribution over ASes) Of all infected
hosts, the top two ASes account for 28.37% of all victims
and top 20 ASes cover 52.54% of all victims. In particular,
most of the top rated ASes are located in Asia.
Conﬁcker victims are concentrated in a few ASes and most
of the top infected ASes are located in Asia. As shown in
Table 2, around 30% of infected hosts belong to one of only
two ASes and more than 50% of infected hosts belong to one
of the (top) 20 ASes. Most highly infected ASes are mainly
distributed in Asia, particularly in China. This result also
suggests that an approach to detect malicious hosts based
on ASes would be practical.

Table 2: Conﬁcker victims in the top 20 ASes.
Result 2.1. (Distribution over ASes - Comparison)
Even though the top two ASes were also sources of previous
botnets, most of other top rated ASes are newly emerged in
the Conﬁcker case.
By comparing the result of the distribution over ASes with
that of previous bots, we ﬁnd that even if there are common
ASes between Conﬁcker and previous bots, there is a sig-
niﬁcant diﬀerence in the locations of infected ASes. Some
studies [18, 31, 32] investigated which ASes are the major
sources of the botnets that deliver spam emails2. We com-
pare their ﬁndings with our result and denote it in Table
In [18], the authors analyzed data collected in 2004 -
3.
2In [32], they only present the top ﬁve of ASes, and that is
why we could not compare the whole list.
2006 and pointed out that most of the bots are located in
North America (particularly in USA), while in [31] and [32]
in which data was collected in 2006 - 2007, it was empha-
sized that bots spread widely over the world. However, in
the case of Conﬁcker, ASes in the USA are no longer shown
in the top 20 list. Instead, most highly infected ASes are
located in Asia and South America.
From this result, we conclude that the trend of major loca-
tions of bot infected hosts is still changing; (i) mainly located
in North America, (ii) widely spread over the World, (iii)
popular in Asia and South America. This trend guides us
to observe Asia and South America more closely than North
America, which used to be the major source of spam email
when we built blacklists to prevent spam at the time. It is
important that the trend of major sources of bots is chang-
ing. Also, we ﬁnd that four ASes in Conﬁcker are never seen
in previous results. Two of them are in Asia (Vietnam and
India) and two of them are in South America (Brazil).
Insight from Result 2 and 2.1. (Change of Infec-
tion Trend) North America used to be the main contribu-
tors of botnets, but now Asia and South America contribute
more. This means that the locations of the main sources of
botnets are changing and we may chase this trend (e.g., new
malware spreading models and defense strategies are proba-
bly needed).
4.2 Distribution Over Domain Names
In this section, we inspect the domain names of each vic-
tim using DNS reverse lookup.3 A domain name indicates a
group in which a host belongs and it can be a good way to
reveal the host itself because domain names are expressed
in easy and comprehensible words.
Result 3. (Distribution over Domain Name) The
.br, .net and .cn domains cover around 24.42% of Conﬁcker
victims. Interestingly, one of the third level domains covers
around 7% of infected hosts, which means it contains more
than 1,700,000 victims.
As shown in Table 4, only a few domains account for about
20% of hosts infected by Conﬁcker. This does not solely ap-
ply to top level domains but to all second level domains
and third level domains as well. In the case of top and sec-
ond level domain names, their scope is quite broad and it
is hard to ﬁnd any big advantage when compared to IP ad-
dress range or AS number. However, for third level domain
names, it is possible to focus on small sets of victims. It is
useful to monitor victims because the top third level domain
includes numerous Conﬁcker victims. In particular, we ﬁnd
that domain 163data.com.cn accounts for 6.88% of infected
hosts. Also, more than 99% of victims in 163data.com.cn in-
clude the word dynamic in their fourth level domain names.
From this, we can guess that they are using dynamic IP ad-
dresses, as their names imply. This result is similar to [31]
which uncovers dynamic IP addresses as a main source of
most spam emails.
3In our DNS reverse lookups, about 49% of victims did
not return valid results and therefore we labeled them as
“Unknown”, shown in Table 4. Since previous studies also
showed similar rates of “unknown” domains, we leave them
in the table.

Table 4: Top 10 Domain Names hosting Conﬁcker Victims in each level.
Result 3.1.
(Distribution over Domain Name -
Comparison) The .net domain is still prevalent, but new
domains such as .br, .cn, and .ru have recently emerged as
heavy resources of botnets. The .com and .edu domains used
to be the major sources of worms, but now they cast oﬀ the
yoke of malicious domains.
Comparing the domain result with previous work, we found
that a few domains that were not previously seen in Con-
ﬁcker. Also, we found that .com and .edu domains, which
used to be nefarious domains, are now relatively clean. Un-
fortunately, because the previous work does not show sec-
ond level and third level domain distributions, we could only
compare top level domains. In previous studies, top contrib-
utors of infected domains are .net, .com and .edu. However,
in the case of Conﬁcker, things have changed. While the .net
domain is still prevalent, there are newly emerged domains
which are not shown in the previous work: .cn, .ru, .in, and
.mx. All domains that are newly seen represent their coun-
tries and we call these ccTLDs (Country Code Top Level
Domains). The report from Verisign [29] shows that the
registration rate of above ccTLDs has increased explosively
for the past three years. This implies that the number of
hosts in newly registered domains have increased exponen-
tially. Therefore we may monitor more closely whether they
are infected by malware or not, since they may not be on
any blacklists. The more interesting part is .edu and .com
domains are no longer serious sources of malware. Of course,
there are infected hosts which still belong to those domains,
but its coverage is reduced to 1.21% in .com and 0.0096% in
.edu. This result implies that the networks in .com and .edu
domains are probably better managed and protected than
before. The comparison result is summarized in Table 5.
Result 3.2.
(Distribution over Domain Name -
Sensitive Domain Name) There are Conﬁcker victims in
government networks and companies listed in Fortune 100,
even though the number of infected hosts is small.
