When attempting to install `psycopg2` on Mac OS X Mavericks, you may encounter an issue where the installation process cannot locate the `pg_config` file, even after specifying its location in `setup.cfg`. In your case, PostgreSQL was installed using Postgres.app, and you have identified that `pg_config` is located at `/Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/MacOS/bin/`.

### Potential Solution
A similar problem has been reported by others, particularly when installing `psycopg2` through PyCharm while using a version of PostgreSQL (e.g., Postgres93.app). The issue seems to arise from the installer not recognizing the `pg_config` file, despite it being present and accessible via the terminal.

#### Steps to Resolve:
1. **Install Python via Homebrew:**
   - First, ensure Homebrew is installed on your system. If not, you can install it by running the following command in your terminal:
     ```sh
     /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
     ```
   - Next, use Homebrew to install a fresh version of Python:
     ```sh
     brew install python
     ```

2. **Use pip from the Homebrew-installed Python:**
   - Locate the Homebrew installation of Python. Typically, it will be in `/usr/local/bin` or `/opt/homebrew/bin` (for Apple Silicon M1).
   - Use the `pip` associated with this Python installation to install `psycopg2`. You can do this by specifying the full path to `pip`:
     ```sh
     /usr/local/bin/pip install psycopg2
     ```
   - Alternatively, you can use `pip3` if it points to the correct Python installation:
     ```sh
     pip3 install psycopg2
     ```

3. **Verify the Installation:**
   - After installation, verify that `psycopg2` is correctly installed by running:
     ```sh
     python -c "import psycopg2; print(psycopg2.__version__)"
     ```

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully install `psycopg2` and resolve the issue with the `pg_config` file. This approach bypasses the potential conflicts that may arise when using an IDE like PyCharm for package management.
