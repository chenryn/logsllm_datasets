### Phantom Network Surveillance UAV/Drone

#### About Me
- **Security Consultant, D.C. Area**
- **Specialties:** Wireless and SCADA Security
- **Experience:** U.S. Government and Commercial Engagements
- **Previous DEF CON Talks:** WarRocketing & WarBallooning (over Las Vegas)
- **Hobbies:** R/C Helicopters, Deep Sea Fishing

#### Outline
1. Introduction: Aerial Wireless Surveillance
2. Past Attempts: Balloons, Rockets, UAVForge
3. New Technology: The Phantom Drone
4. Building the Network Surveillance Drone
5. Flights & Results
6. Conclusion

#### What's This About?
- **Objective:** Aerial visual and wireless (802.11) surveillance
- **Challenges:**
  - **WarRocketing:** Limited air time
  - **WarBallooning:** Limited directional control, weak signals
  - **Other Projects:**
    - **Blackhat 2011, Tassey & Perkins:** WASP wireless spy drone
    - **UAVForge 2011:** Covert visual surveillance; no winner due to various issues

#### Why Did UAVForge Fail?
- **Factors:**
  - **Government Requirements:** Heli operations beyond line of sight (LoS)
  - **Limited First Person View (FPV) Techniques**
  - **Autonomous Drone Operation Required:** Including obstacle avoidance
  - **Landing Issues:** Many crashes due to poor descent and flight attitude indicators

#### What's New Since 2011?
- **Technological Improvements:**
  - **Computers:** Super tiny, e.g., Cotton Candy (30 grams) with Bluetooth, HDMI, and 802.11 capabilities
  - **WiFi Pineapple (Hak5):** Small, remotely accessible via 3G/4G
  - **DJI Phantom:** First "consumer quality" drone, easily flyable by the average person

#### Meet the DJI Phantom
- **Introduction:** DJI Innovations introduced the Phantom in January 2013
- **Reputation:** Most stable drone platform in the air today
- **Features:**
  - GPS Auto-Pilot
  - Auto “Return to Home”
  - High payload capability: up to 400 grams
  - Relatively Inexpensive: $679 (compared to UAVForge drones at $2K-9K)

#### TechnoLust Overcomes Me: Let's Build This!
- **Envisioned Uses for Phantom Network Surveillance:**
  - **Site Survey:** Large area coverage in a short time
  - **Observation and Communications Capture:** For incidents like the Boston Marathon Bombing
  - **Covert Missions:** Using the “Perch, Listen & Engage” technique from rooftops or other inaccessible locations

#### Payload Design
- **Two Payloads:**
  - **Cotton Candy + WiSpy or KillerBee**
  - **Flying Pineapple:** Hak5 Pineapple + GSM 3G/4G

#### Site Survey Payload
- **Design Considerations:**
  - **Cotton Candy:** Perfect headless computer
  - **Apple Bluetooth Keyboard & Mouse:** Instantly detachable
  - **ARM Processor:** Runs Ubuntu or Android OS
  - **Specifications:** 1.2 GHz ARM Cortex-A9 CPU, 1GB RAM, microSD image
  - **Wireless Tools:** Kismet, WiSpy (spectools), Killerbee for ZIGBEE

#### WiSpy Flight Results
- **Lake Neighborhood:** Ongoing flights
- **2.4 GHz Results:**

#### We Found 802.11 Sources – What’s Next?
- **The Flying Pineapple:**
  - **Tools:** Airodump, sslstrip, site survey, etc.
  - **Payload Objectives:**
    1. Land on a residential or commercial building and "Perch"
    2. Conduct operations
    3. Return Phantom + payload safely to starting point
  - **DARPA Quote:** "The primary (perching) benefit is to increase (surveillance) persistence by reducing mission power demands while providing stable sensor emplacement."

#### Pineapple Remote Operation
- **Remote Administration & Monitoring:**
  - Via 3G or 4G
  - Utilizes a relay server, ssh proxy (e.g., Hawaii)
  - Autossh keeps the tunnel alive to the Pineapple
  - Operations team shells into the Drone and utilizes command prompt or GUI
  - Battery Life: 1200 mAh LiPo, approximately 2-3 hours with T-Mobile Rocket ZTE-MF592 (GSM)
  - CDMA devices consume twice the power (not recommended)

#### Pineapple Offensive Ops
- **Selected Capabilities:**
  - **OpenWRT running Jasager:** "The Yes Man"
  - **URL Snarf**
  - **DNS Spoofing**
  - **New HTTP Landing Page for Phishing, etc.**
  - **Airodump-ng:** Runs great in-flight
  - **Demo Pineapple GUI:** http over ssh

#### Network Diagram
- **Placeholder:** Reverse SSH with Hawaii relay diagram
- **Update:** Will be posted to DEFCON site

#### Pineapple Flight Results
- **Airodump-NG:**

#### Flight Video
- **Placeholder:** Show Phantom Mission Flight Videos here (5 min. MAX)
- **No Text:** All live flights from July 2013
- **Update:** Will be posted to DEFCON site

#### How Did We Compare to UAVForge Team Scores?
- **Phantom Score:** Approximately 35

#### Conclusion / Future Work
- **Successful Proof of Concept:**
  - Demonstrated “Perch, Listen, and Engage” wireless network surveillance
- **Next Steps:**
  - Full FPV for non-LoS operations
  - Autonomous operation with waypoints (Naza-M available now)
  - Descent rate instruments for precision landing
  - Extend 3-hour surveillance capability with better power design
  - Enable multiple building operations

#### Legal & Safety Issues
- **Do NOT:**
  - Fly a quadcopter as large and expensive as the Phantom without experience
  - Start small: Blade MQX quadcopter is ideal
  - Fly beyond LOS or above 400 ft. AGL (Illegal under current FAA rules)
  - Fly within 3 miles of any airport
  - Violate people’s privacy with cameras or other devices
- **Respect Property Rights:**
  - If your equipment lands on someone else’s property, you may never get it back or face trespassing charges
  - Ensure safety by flying away from people and making everyone aware of the aerial operation
