I am attempting to use Jug for parallel processing. I have Canopy installed, and I followed the online documentation to install Jug using the command `pip install jug`.

To locate where Jug was installed, I re-ran the same installation command, which provided the following output:

```
Requirement already satisfied (use --upgrade to upgrade): jug in
  c:\users\[userfolder]\appdata\local\enthought\canopy\user\lib\site-packages
  (from jug)
Requirement already satisfied (use --upgrade to upgrade): six in
  c:\users\[userfolder]\appdata\local\enthought\canopy\user\lib\site-packages
  (from jug)
Requirement already satisfied (use --upgrade to upgrade): redis in
  c:\users\[userfolder]\appdata\local\enthought\canopy\user\lib\site-packages
  (from jug)
```

Based on this, I assumed that Jug was installed in the directory `c:\users\[userfolder]\appdata\local\enthought\canopy\user\lib\site-packages`. I verified this by listing the files in the directory and found Jug there.

However, I am unsure whether Jug is an executable file, a Python script, or something else. I attempted to run the command `jug C:\primes.py` from within the site-packages directory, but it resulted in an error message stating that "jug" is not recognized as a cmdlet, function, script file, etc.

I also tried the commands `./jug C:\primes.py` and `.\jug C:\primes.py`, but neither worked.

Additionally, I tried running `python -m jug status C:\primes.py`, which gave me an error indicating that it could not find the `_main_` module in 'jug'.

I am now at a loss on how to run Jug. Has anyone successfully used Jug on Windows and can provide guidance?

**Update:**
I have since resolved the issue. It was related to Python's relative import mechanism.
