User: I want to use Jug for parallel processing. I have a Canopy installed and I also installed Jug using command pip install jug according to the documentation online.
In order to find where jug is installed, I installed jug again using the same command as above, it showed
me:

Requirement already satisfied (use --upgrade to upgrade): jug in
  c:\users[userfolder]\appdata\local\enthought\canopy\user\lib\site-packages
  (from jug)
Requirement already satisfied (use --upgrade to upgrade): six in
  c:\users[userfolder]\appdata\local\enthought\canopy\user\lib\site-packages
  (from jug)
Requirement already satisfied (use --upgrade to upgrade): redis in
  c:\users[userfolder]\appdata\local\enthought\canopy\user\lib\site-packages
  (from jug)

Now, I thought my jug is in the path of c:\users\[userfolder]\appdata\local\enthought\canopy\user\lib\site-package and it is there since I listed all files under this folder and I saw it.
I am not sure this jug is a exe or py or something else, but I tried to run a command: jug C:\primes.py under this folder, it gave me error message said jug is not a recognized as the name of cmdlet, function, script file....
I also tried the command ./jug C:\primes.py and .\jug C:\primes.py, but none of them works.
In addition, I tried python jug status C:\primes.py and this one gave me message of cannot find '_main_' module in 'jug'.
Now I have no idea how to run jug. Has someone ever tried jug on windows could help me with it?
Assistant: I figured it out myself. It is related to python's relative import.
