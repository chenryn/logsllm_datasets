User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Nginx root dir is bad I have a problem,

I have changed the directory of a subdomain in nginx,

Before pointed to:

/srv/www/musica


And now it aims at:

/srv/www/sonerezh


I have configured both:

/etc/nginx/sites-available/musica.conf


as:

/etc/php/5.6/fpm/pool.d/musica.conf


To point to:

/srv/www/sonerezh


And I've restarted the services of php and nginx, but the nginx log tells me to keep looking on the path:


  2017/05/24 08:54:26 [error] 1580 # 1580: * 9974
  
  /srv/www/musica/index.html" is not found (2: No such file or
  directory) ...


I do not understand why this is happening and the new directory path is not updated.

Assistant: Restarting the server was solved
