User: How to set up NTP time synchronization service on Linux server?
Assistant: NTP (Network Time Protocol) is a protocol for synchronizing computer clocks. Setting up the NTP time synchronization service on the Linux server can ensure that the server clock is synchronized with other network devices, ensuring the correct time of applications and services. Here are the steps to set up the NTP time synchronization service on a Linux server: 1. Install the NTP client On most Linux distributions, the NTP client is pre-installed, if it is not installed, you can use the following command to install it: Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt-get install ntp CentOS/Fedora: sudo yum install ntp 2. Configure the NTP client Open the NTP configuration file /etc/ntp.conf and change the content of the file to the following: server ntp1.aliyun.com iburst server ntp2.aliyun .com iburst server ntp3.aliyun.com iburst Here we take Aliyun's NTP server as an example to configure. 3. Start the NTP service To start the NTP service, you can use the following command: sudo service ntp start 4. Set the NTP service to start automatically at boot In order to start the NTP service automatically after the server restarts, we need to add the NTP service to the startup item, you can use the following command: sudo update-rc.d ntp defaults 5. View the NTP synchronization status After the NTP synchronization is successful, we can use the following command to view the NTP synchronization status: ntpq -p This command will display the list of NTP servers connected to the current server, and the relationship between these servers and the server time deviation. So far, setting up the NTP time synchronization service on the Linux server is complete.
