User: I have a script whose output is piped to less, and I would like the script to print it's statements into less as they come, rather than all at once.
I found that if I flush stdout (via sys.stdout.flush()) after each print, the line is displayed in less when flushed (obviously).
My question is: Are there any drawbacks to doing this? My script has hundreds of thousands of lines being printed, would flushing after each line cause problems?
My impression is yes, because you take extra resources up for displaying each time you flush, as well as completely circumventing the idea of buffered output
Assistant: Basically, the only drawback is that it's potentially slower.  The buffering on stdin allows your program to run ahead of the physical I/O which is slow.
However, if you're sending it to less, you're operating at human speeds anyway -- it's not going to make a difference.
