User: Our company needs to build an internal Gitlab server for code management and collaborative development. Please list the steps to build the Gitlab server, and pay attention to the key details.
Assistant: 1. Install dependent environment. Before building the Gitlab server, you need to install some dependent environments, including Ruby, Git, Nginx, etc. The specific installation commands depend on the operating system and need to be completed according to the installation documentation. 2. Download and install Gitlab. You can download the latest version of Gitlab from the official website of Gitlab for installation, or you can build your own version from the open source code library. Here, download and install from the official website as an example. Download the Gitlab installation package: ``` wget -c https://mirror.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/gitlab-ce/yum/el7/gitlab-ce-13.4.1-ce.0.el7.x86_64.rpm ``` 3. Install Gitlab. Root permission is required to install Gitlab. Execute the following command: ``` sudo rpm -i gitlab-ce-13.4.1-ce.0.el7.x86_64.rpm ``` The installation process will take a while, just wait for it to complete. 4. Configure Gitlab. To configure Gitlab, you need to modify the configuration file. The configuration file path is /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb: ``` vim /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb ``` You can modify the configuration items according to actual needs. After the modification is completed, you need to execute Configuration command: ``` gitlab-ctl reconfigure ``` 5. Start Gitlab. To start Gitlab, you need to execute the following command: ``` gitlab-ctl start ``` You can execute the following command to check the Gitlab service status: ``` gitlab-ctl status ``` 6. Access Gitlab. Enter the server IP address or domain name in the browser, and add port 80 or 443 to access the Gitlab website. For the first visit, you need to enter the administrator account and password. After completing the filling, you can start using Gitlab. 7. Key details. When building a Gitlab server, you need to pay attention to the following key details: - You need to pay attention to the operating system version and bit number when installing the dependent environment, and the installation commands also need to be adjusted according to different operating systems. - When modifying the Gitlab configuration file, you need to pay attention to the function and value range of each configuration item. Mistakes in modification may cause Gitlab to fail to operate normally. - When the firewall is enabled on the server, you need to pay attention to opening the ports required by Gitlab, otherwise you cannot access the Gitlab website. - Before starting to use Gitlab, you need to initialize the administrator account, which can be done by modifying the configuration file or executing commands on the command line.
