**Abstract:**
The analysis of organic acids provides crucial insights into central metabolism. Traditionally, this has been performed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), which requires extensive sample preparation and can only process small batches of samples. GC-MS under standard conditions is not suitable for analyzing acylcarnitines and acylglycines due to their polar nature, leading to poor detection.

We developed a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) on the UltiMate (Dionex) LC triple quadrupole 6500 (Sciex) MS. This method enables the analysis of 124 organic acids, acylcarnitines, and acylglycines in biological matrices. Under acidic conditions with formic acid on a non-polar C18 column, good separation of isomers was achieved. MRM transitions allowed for the detection and quantification of these compounds in urine, serum, and intracellular content. The run time is 26 minutes.

Analytes showed excellent linearity (r² > 0.99) and reproducibility (CV < 10%). The method's potential was demonstrated in a study comparing 13 obese children to 13 healthy children (ages 10-16). The constructed OPLS-DA model successfully discriminated between the two groups, with a Q² of 0.669 and R² of 0.541, supported by permutation testing and CV-ANOVA p-values.

In another study, we analyzed the effects of a low-carbohydrate diet (LCD) and the combination of LCD and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) on the fasting metabolic state. Over 300 metabolites were identified, including various lipids, amino acids, and intermediate polarity metabolites like acylcarnitines. Data processing was conducted using commercial and open-source tools, and multivariate data analysis techniques such as linear mixed-effect regression models and orthogonal projections to latent structures effects projection (OPLS-EP) were applied. Our findings suggest that LCD and the combination of LCD and RYGB elicit distinct changes in the fasting metabolic state, primarily driven by alterations in acylcarnitines and lipids. Additionally, mixed-meal test responses revealed differences between individuals with and without type 2 diabetes (T2D), which may help elucidate the mechanisms underlying T2D remission.
