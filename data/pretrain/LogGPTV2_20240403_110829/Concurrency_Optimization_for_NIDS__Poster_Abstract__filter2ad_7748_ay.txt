Analysis of organic acids offers an important insight into central metabolism It has traditionally been performed using routine GC-MS platform that 
requires lengthy sample preparation and allows analysis of just a small batches of samples The GC-MS under common conditions is not capable 
to analyze acylcarnitines (together with organic acids) and acylglycines as polar compounds suffer from poor detection The LC-MS/MS multiple 
reaction monitoring (MRM) method was developed on the UltiMate (Dionex) LC triple quadrupole 6500 (Sciex) MS for the analysis of 124 organic 
acids, acylcarnitines and acylglycines in biological matrices Under acidic conditions of formic acid on non-polar C18 column, good separation of 
isomers was obtained Through MRM transitions, detection and quantification of compounds present in urine, serum and intracellular content were 
enabled The run time takes 26 min Analytes show good linearity (r2 > 099) and reproducibility (CV 099 or 090 respectively) and recovery were observed The potential of this method was demonstrated in a first 
setup, where 13 obese were compared to 13 healthy children (10-16y) The constructed OPLS-DA model enabled us to discriminate adolescents 
(obese versus healthy weight), reflected by a promising Q2 of 0669 and R2 of 0541, good permutation testing and CV-ANOVA p 300 identified metabolites, including a variety of lipids, low molecular weight metabolites, ie amino acids, and 
metabolites with intermediate polarity, ie acylcarnitines After data processing using commercial and open-source tools and in-house libraries, 
we applied multivariate data analyses techniques such as linear mixed-effect regression models and orthogonal projections to latent structures 
effects projection (OPLS-EP), an approach that allows multivariate modeling of dependent samples Our data suggest that the effects of LCD, and 
the combination of LCD and RYGB, elicit different changes in the fasting metabolic state These effects were driven by changes in acylcarnitines and 
various lipids Furthermore, analyzing metabolic profiles in response to mixed-meal tests identified differences between individuals with and without 
T2D, which may aid unraveling the mechanisms driving T2D remission
