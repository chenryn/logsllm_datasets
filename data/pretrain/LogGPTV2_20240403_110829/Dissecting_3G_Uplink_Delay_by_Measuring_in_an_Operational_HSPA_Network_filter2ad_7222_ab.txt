### 3G Uplink Delay Analysis in an Operational HSPA Network

#### Introduction
This document presents the analysis and modeling of latency components in a 3G HSUPA (High-Speed Uplink Packet Access) communication network. The focus is on the user equipment (UE), base station (NodeB), and radio network controller (RNC). The goal is to dissect and understand the delay contributions from each component, leading to a comprehensive model for the overall uplink delay.

#### Latency Contributions

1. **User Equipment (UE) - Δ1**
   - **Fig. 7: Empirical Probability Density Function (PDF) of Δ1**
     - The delay contribution of the USB-modem, denoted as Δ1, is shown in Fig. 7.
     - The PDF is derived from timestamps at the application interface and the rising edge of the transmission power at the air interface.
     - The packet size varies from 1 to 1500 Bytes.
     - The delay distribution is concentrated between 5 to 15 ms, with a uniform character.
     - This can be attributed to a fixed 5 ms delay due to data processing in the USB-modem and a random delay of up to 10 ms while waiting for a transmission window.
     - The start of transmission can only occur at the beginning of a TTI (Transmission Time Interval), leading to a random wait time for data in the queue.
     - The small number of packets with delays below 5 ms are measurement artifacts, possibly due to retransmissions or misinterpreted control information.
     - **Modeling Δ1:**
       \[
       \Delta_1 = 5\text{ms} + X \cdot 10\text{ms} + \left\lceil \frac{l}{\alpha} \right\rceil \cdot 10\text{ms}
       \]
       where \(X\) is a uniformly distributed random variable between 0 and 1, \(l\) is the payload length, \(\alpha\) is the length-factor (e.g., 800 Bytes), and \(\left\lceil \cdot \right\rceil\) denotes the ceiling operation.

2. **NodeB - Δ2**
   - **Fig. 8: Logarithmic Histogram of Δ2 and Packet Size**
     - Fig. 8 shows the logarithmic histogram of the delay introduced by the NodeB.
     - Delays are calculated by subtracting the timestamp of the falling edge of the transmission power at the air interface from the last RLC frame transmitted over the Iub interface.
     - The minimum delay is 5 ms, with up to 7 ms of additional latency depending on the packet size.
     - **Modeling Δ2:**
       \[
       \Delta_2 = 5\text{ms} + \left( l \mod \alpha \right) \cdot \frac{1\text{ms}}{\text{kByte}}
       \]
       where \(\mod\) denotes the modulo operator.

3. **Radio Network Controller (RNC) - Δ3**
   - **Fig. 9: Logarithmic Histogram of Δ3 and Packet Size**
     - Fig. 9 displays the delay characteristics of the RNC.
     - The delay is the difference in time between the last RLC packet fragment at the Iub interface and the last IP packet fragment at the Gn interface.
     - The minimum latency introduced by the RNC is 1.5 ms, with an additional delay of up to 4 ms depending on the packet size.
     - **Modeling Δ3:**
       \[
       \Delta_3 = 1.5\text{ms} + \left( l \mod \alpha \right) \cdot \frac{2\text{ms}}{\text{kByte}}
       \]

#### Accumulated Delay

- **Fig. 10: Accumulated Delay Over Packet Size**
  - The accumulated delay experienced by the user application is shown in Fig. 10.
  - The dashed lines represent the modeled delay.
  - **Combined Model:**
    \[
    \Delta = 11.5\text{ms} + X \cdot 10\text{ms} + \left\lceil \frac{l}{\alpha} \right\rceil \cdot 10\text{ms} + \left( l \mod \alpha \right) \cdot \frac{3\text{ms}}{\text{kByte}}
    \]
  - This model accurately represents the regions of high density in Figs. 10 and 11(c).
  - The parameter \(\alpha\) is influenced by factors such as data rate and channel quality, and is defined by the HSUPA scheduler.

#### Conclusion and Outlook

- The average delay for a 1 kByte packet is 30 ms, with contributions from UE (66%), NodeB (20%), and RNC (14%).
- The 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE) target of 5 ms delay necessitates significant improvements in the core network.
- The presented models provide an average performance accuracy of 95%.
