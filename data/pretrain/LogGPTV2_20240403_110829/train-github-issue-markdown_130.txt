In the Blender Export 4.4 there is an issue with the vertices of morph
targets. They are parsed as triplets of arrays: `[[x,y,z],[x,y,z],...]` but
should be one singel array `[x,y,z,x,y,z]`.
I'm not good enough with python to make the change, but I think it's
`extend([vertex.co.x, vertex.co.y, vertex.co.z])` that should be
`extend((vertex.co.x, vertex.co.y, vertex.co.z))` on line 409 in mesh.py.
I't worked for me when changing in the exported json object directly.
