APPENDIX C: RISK EXPOSURE FRAMEWORK38 
There are numerous opportunities for vulnerabilities that impact the enterprise environment or 
the system/element to be intentionally or unintentionally inserted, created, or exploited 
throughout the supply chain. The exploitation of these vulnerabilities is known as a supply chain 
threat event. A Threat Scenario is a set of discrete threat events associated with a specific 
potential or identified existing threat source or multiple threat sources, partially ordered in time. 
Developing and analyzing threat scenarios can help enterprises have a more comprehensive 
understanding of the various types of threat events that can occur and lay the groundwork for 
analyzing the likelihood and impact that a specific event or events would have on an enterprise. 
Conducting this analysis is a useful way to discover gaps in controls and to identify and prioritize 
appropriate mitigating strategies.39  
Threat scenarios are generally used in two ways: 
1. To translate the often disconnected information garnered from a risk assessment, as 
described in [NIST SP 800-30, Rev. 1], into a more narrowly scoped and tangible story-
like situation for further evaluation. These stories can help enterprises discover 
dependencies and additional vulnerabilities that require mitigation and are used for 
training.  
2. To determine the impact that a successful exercise of a specific vulnerability would have 
on the enterprise and identify the benefits of mitigating strategies.  
Threat scenarios serve as a critical component of the enterprise’s cybersecurity supply chain risk 
management process described in Appendix G of this publication. An enterprise forms a threat 
scenario to analyze a disparate set of threat and vulnerability conditions to assemble a cohesive 
story that can be analyzed as part of a risk assessment. With a threat scenario defined, the 
enterprise can complete a risk assessment to understand how likely the scenario is and what 
would happen (i.e., the impact) as a result. Ultimately, the analyzed components of a threat 
scenario are used to reach a risk determination that represents the conclusion of an enterprise’s 
level of exposure to cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain.  
Once a risk determination has been made, the enterprise will determine a path for responding to 
the risk using the Risk Exposure Framework. Within the Risk Exposure Framework, enterprises 
will document the threat scenario, the risk analysis, the identified risk response strategy, and any 
associated C-SCRM controls.  
This appendix provides an example of a Risk Exposure Framework for C-SCRM that can be 
used by enterprises to develop a tailored Risk Exposure Framework for potential and identified 
threats that best suits their needs. It contains six examples of how this framework may be used. 
The examples differ slightly in their implementation of the framework so as to show how the 
38 Departments and agencies should refer to Appendix F to implement this guidance in accordance with Executive Order 14028, Improving the 
Nation’s Cybersecurity.  
39 Additional example threat scenarios and threat lists can be found in the ICT SCRM Task Force: Threat Scenarios Report (v3), August 2021, 
https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/ict-scrm-task-force-threat-scenarios-report-v3.pdf. This report leveraged the 2015 version of 
NIST SP 800-161.

framework may be tailored by an enterprise. Each example identifies one or more vulnerabilities, 
describes a specific threat source, identifies the expected impact on the enterprise, and proposes 
[SP 800-161, Rev. 1] C-SCRM controls that would help mitigate the resulting risk.  
RISK EXPOSURE FRAMEWORK 
Step 1: Create a Plan for Developing and Analyzing Threat Scenarios 
• Identify the purpose of the threat scenario analysis in terms of the objectives, milestones, 
and expected deliverables.  
• Identify the scope of enterprise applicability, level of detail, and other constraints.  
• Identify resources to be used, including personnel, time, and equipment.  
• Define a Risk Exposure Framework to be used for analyzing scenarios. 
Step 2: Characterize the Environment 
• Identify core mission and business processes and key enterprise dependencies.  
• Describe threat sources that are relevant to the enterprise. Include the motivation and 
resources available to the threat source, if applicable.  
• List known vulnerabilities or areas of concern. (Note: Areas of concern include the 
planned outsourcing of a manufacturing plant, the pending termination of a maintenance 
contract, or the discontinued manufacture of an element).  
• Identify existing and planned controls.  
• Identify related regulations, standards, policies, and procedures.  
• Define an acceptable level of risk (risk threshold) per the enterprise’s assessment of 
Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs); system criticality; and a risk owner’s set of 
mission or business priorities. The level of risk or risk threshold can be periodically 
revisited and adjusted to reflect the elasticity of the global supply chain, enterprise 
changes, and new mission priorities. 
Step 3: Develop and Select Threat Events for Analysis 
• List possible ways that threat sources could exploit known vulnerabilities or impact areas 
of concern to create a list of events. (Note: Historical data is useful for determining this 
information.)  
• Briefly outline the series of consequences that could occur as a result of each threat event. 
These may be as broad or specific as necessary. If applicable, estimate the likelihood and 
impact of each event.  
• Eliminate those events that are clearly outside of the defined purpose and scope of the 
analysis.  
• In more detail, describe the remaining potential threat events. Include the TTPs that a 
threat source may use to carry out attacks. (Note: The level of detail in the description is 
dependent on the needs of the enterprise.) 
• Select for analysis those events that best fit the defined purpose and scope of the analysis. 
More likely or impactful events, areas of concern to the enterprise, and an event that can 
represent several of the other listed events are generally useful candidates.

Step 4: Conduct an Analysis Using the Risk Exposure Framework 
• For each threat event, note any immediate consequences of the event and identify those 
enterprise units and processes that would be affected, taking into account applicable 
regulations, standards, policies, and procedures; existing and planned controls; and the 
extent to which those controls are able to effectively prevent, withstand, or otherwise 
mitigate the harm that could result from the threat event. 
• Estimate the impact that these consequences would have on the mission and business 
processes, information, assets, enterprise units, and other stakeholders affected, 
preferably in quantitative terms from historical data and taking into account existing and 
planned controls and applicable regulations, standards, policies, and procedures. (Note: It 
may be beneficial to identify a “most likely” impact level and a “worst-case” or “100-
year” impact level.) 
• Identify those enterprise units, processes, information (access or flows), and/or assets that 
may or would be subsequently affected, as well as the consequences and impact levels 
until each affected critical item has been analyzed, taking into account existing and 
planned controls and applicable regulations, standards, policies, and procedures (e.g., if a 
critical server goes down, one of the first processes affected may be the technology 
support department, but if they determine that a new part is needed to bring the server 
back up, the procurement department may become involved). 
Step 5: Determine C-SCRM Applicable Controls 
• Determine if and which threat scenario events create a risk level that exceeds a risk 
owner’s acceptable level of risk (risk threshold). (Note: In some cases, the level of 
acceptable risk may be dependent on the capability to implement or the cost of mitigating 
strategies.) Identify opportunities to strengthen existing controls or potential new 
mitigating controls. Using a list of standards or recommended controls can simplify this 
process. This appendix uses the controls in Appendix A of this document. 
• Estimate the effectiveness of existing and planned controls at reducing the risk of a 
scenario.  
• Estimate the capability and resources needed (in terms of money, personnel, and time) to 
implement potential new or strengthened controls.  
• Identify those C-SCRM controls or combinations of C-SCRM controls that could cause 
the estimated residual risk of a threat event to drop to an acceptable level in the most 
resource-effective manner, taking into account any rules or regulations that may apply. 
(Note: Consider the potential that one control will help mitigate the risk of more than one 
event or that a control may increase the risk of a separate event.)  
Step 6: Evaluate/Feedback 
• Develop a plan to implement the selected controls and evaluate their effectiveness.  
• 
Evaluate the effectiveness of the Risk Exposure Framework, and make improvements as 
needed.
