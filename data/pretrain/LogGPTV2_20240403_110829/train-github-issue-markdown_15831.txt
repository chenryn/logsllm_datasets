I am using the logstash 1.3.2 RPM found in this repository:  
http://packages.elasticsearch.org/logstash/1.3/centos
I have set CONF_DIR to /etc/logstash/conf.d/* _/_.conf.  
The asterisks seem to be messing with the regular expression used by pgrep to
find the PID of the process that was started.
The process starts fine, but then the process cannot be killed when using the
stop command on the init script. When issuing a restart, there will be
duplicate processes.  
Escaping the asterisks for pgrep allowed me to get the pid.  
Either the asterisks need to be escaped or a different value besides the full
ARGS list should be used to find the PID.
Also, in a somewhat related issue. It seems that in the init script for
logstash, reads the ${DAEMON} variable in a few places, but it is never set. I
think ${DAEMON} should probably be the ${JAVA} variable.
