User: Please give a feasible database disaster recovery solution to minimize data loss.
Assistant: feasible database disaster recovery solution may include the following steps: 1. Asymmetric cluster deployment: The database cluster adopts an asymmetric deployment, with one node serving as the master node and the other nodes serving as backup nodes. The master node is responsible for processing all read and write requests, and the backup node obtains the update records of the master node to ensure data backup. 2. Real-time data backup: back up the data of the master node to the backup node in real time. Backup can be done by means of ink cartridge (Redo Log) and archive (Archive), so as to realize real-time backup of data. Backup nodes can regularly back up data to different backup disks to prevent data loss. 3. Timely recovery: Take 10-15 minutes or less as the preparation time to perform disaster recovery and recovery in the case of switching from the primary node to the backup node. Recovery time from local disk failures can be shorter because the backup node can share the same disk as the primary node. 4. Off-site backup: Deploy the master node and backup node in different data centers or computer rooms. Off-site backup can provide better error correction capabilities when major accidents cause business interruption. The recovery time and data loss of off-site backup depend on the offline time of the backup data and the network transmission delay introduced. 5. Do a good job of incremental backup: the combination of differential backup and full backup ensures the timeliness and accuracy of data backup. Incremental backup is the incremental part of the Redo Log obtained by the backup node from the master node, and is the main form of incremental backup. 6. Regular inspection and testing: Regularly check and test the normal backup integrity of the backup node to ensure the normal operation of the backup node. The test can reproduce the simulated failure of the cluster to test the feasibility of switching, data recovery and business recovery.
