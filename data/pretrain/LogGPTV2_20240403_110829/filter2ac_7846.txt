### Title: Black Hat US-19: Paging All Windows Geeks â€“ Uncovering Malware in Windows 10 Compressed Memory

The FireEye FLARE team has conducted an in-depth analysis of the memory compression implementation in Windows 10, enabling access to data stored in the newly introduced and undocumented virtual store. This research is a significant step forward in closing the gap that previously allowed malware to evade detection during memory forensic analysis. By open-sourcing our findings, we aim to advance the field of computer forensics.

Traditionally, a comprehensive Windows memory inspection involved parsing physical memory and filling in any missing gaps from the page file. Each page, whether it was in physical memory or the page file, could be inspected by simply viewing its contents. However, the introduction of the virtual store, which contains compressed pages, has disrupted this well-established method. To inspect these compressed pages, forensic tools must now identify which pages are compressed, locate them, and decompress their contents for analysis.

Our research results have been open-sourced as plugins for Volatility and Rekall, two popular memory analysis frameworks, to assist incident response (IR) investigators and forensic analysts. These plugins will help the community integrate support for new Windows 10 builds into their preferred forensic tools.

In this presentation, we will delve into the details of the memory compression implementation in Windows 10, exploring the undocumented structures and algorithms involved. We will also introduce a tool developed by the FLARE team that automates the process of extracting these structures from new Windows builds. This tool leverages the FLARE-EMU emulation framework to generate the necessary undocumented structures, ensuring that the forensic community can stay ahead of evolving threats.
