metric, the cost of sending from s to d is
most certainly the case that ETX1 is what networks should use, not
ETX2, but we compare against both ETX1 and ETX2 here. Fi-
nally, we restrict our attention to networks with at least ﬁve nodes,
as smaller networks are unlikely to show signiﬁcant differences.

Figures 8 and 9 show the fraction improvement of ExOR over
ETX for each source-destination pair in all of our networks with at
least ﬁve nodes. This fraction is in terms of the expected number
of transmissions needed to send a packet. An improvement of x
means ETX1 requires (x∗ 100)% more transmissions than oppor-
tunistic routing (for example, an ExOR cost of 1.2 and an ETX
cost of 1.5 is an improvement of .25). The mean of the ETX1 to
opportunistic routing ratio of the expected number of packets sent
ranges from .09 to .11 depending on the bit rate (that is, roughly
a 9-11% improvement); the median ranges from .05 to .08 for all
bit rates. For between 13% and 20% of pairs, there is no improve-
ment, regardless of bit rate. With ETX2, the improvement is more
substantive: a mean ratio of between .39 and 1.3 for the ﬁve low-
est bit rates, and between 7.26 and 9.25 for the two highest. The
median is between .30 and .86 for the ﬁve lowest bit rates, and .80
and .86 for the two highest. If we restrict our analysis to the 20%
of source-destination pairs with the most improvement, we see a
slight improvement for ETX1. In this case, the mean ranges from
.25 to .29, and the median from .24 to .27.
The 1 in the numerator accounts for the one transmission that s
made to broadcast the packet in the ﬁrst place, and the denominator
accounts for the fact that there is a small probability that the packet
will not leave s.
To calculate the ETX metric of a link, we consider two ap-
proaches. ETX1 uses a probability of 1 for the link-layer ACK,
which is sent at the lowest bit rate and usually has a much higher
probability of arriving than a packet. This means that, under the
5.2 Causes of Improvement
In this section, we examine the factors that can cause a path to
see improvement (or not) with ExOR. In particular, we ﬁnd that
the differences between the improvements over ETX1 and ETX2
arise due to link asymmetry, the overall lack of improvement of
ExOR over ETX1 is a result of many paths being short, and he
average improvement from ExOR roughly increases as path length
increases.

5.2.1
Impact of Link Asymmetry
The reason that ETX1 and ETX2 have such different perfor-
mance is that link delivery rates are asymmetric. Figure 10 shows
the CDF of the link asymmetries:
the x-axis is the ratio of the
packet success rate at the optimal bit rate between A and B, and
the packet success rate at the optimal bit rate between B and A,
for each link AB. Although the degree of asymmetry is not as pro-
nounced as in some previous smaller-scale studies, it exists, and is
the reason why the gains of opportunistic routing are more signif-
icant with ETX2 (recall that ETX2 assumes a lossy ACK-channel
whereas ETX1 does not).
5.2.2
Impact of Path Length and Diversity
As discussed in Section 2.3, short paths are unlikely to see much
beneﬁt when using ExOR. Figure 11 shows that, indeed, most paths
are short. For the ﬁve lowest bit rates, between 30 and 40% of
paths are only one hop, and around 80% are fewer than three hops.
However, for the two highest bit rates, roughly 40% of the paths
are more than three hops. These long paths are the ones on which
ETX2 sees the greatest improvement. The lack of improvement of
ExOR over ETX1 supports the recent work of Afanasyev and Sno-
eren, who found that ExOR sees most of its improvement due to its
bulk-acknowledgment scheme rather than because of opportunistic
receptions [1].
In Figure 12 we plot the path length vs.
the median and max-
imum improvement. Because the trends for each bit rate are the
same, Figure 12 presents these quantities averaged over all bit rates.
The median improvement almost always increases with the path
length. This result is expected, and is what is indicated in [7]. How-
ever, the maximum improvement tends to decrease with the path
length. We also see a similar result with path diversity (not pic-
tured): the median improvement increases as the number of diverse
paths from the source to the destination increases, but the maximum
improvement tends to decrease. The fact that the median improve-
ment increases in both of these cases makes sense; more nodes in
between the source and destination means more nodes with for-
warding potential.
Non-intuitively, the paths with the maximum proportional im-
provements tend to be short paths. For instance, consider the path
A → B → C, with link probabilities of .9 on the links A → B and
B → C, and also a probability of .3 that the packet goes from A to
C directly when broadcasted. We expect to need roughly 2.2 trans-
mission for each packet (the shortest ETX1 path is A → B → C, but
there is a probability of .3 that ExOR will reduce this to 1 transmis-

portunistic routing vs. path length. Note that while the me-
dian improvement increases with path length—as expected—
the maximum in fact decreases.
sion). Hence, the high proportional improvement. However, these
types of paths are somewhat rare, which is why the median path
improvement still increases with path length.
5.3 Network Variability
Having discussed what types of links see see the best ExOR im-
provements, we now turn our attention to the types of networks that
do. Given our conclusions in the previous section, we might expect
that larger networks (with the potential for longer paths) would see
the good improvements, as the median improvement increases with
path length.
In Figure 13 we plot the mean improvement over all links in a
network vs.
the number of nodes in the network (for readability,
we leave out our largest networks, but the result is consistent), at
1Mbit/s (the results are similar at other bit rates; we do not present
them here). We also include standard deviation bars to indicate the
variability of improvement. Counter-intuitively, the mean improve-
ment does not increase with network size; in fact, it remains rela-
tively constant. Similarly, the variability in improvement is about
the same regardless of size. The reason for this constancy is that
even though large networks have more long paths—and thus paths
that tend to see greater improvements with ExOR—they also have
many more shorter paths than small networks. These short paths
see less improvement, keeping the mean low, as well as the vari-
ance.
5.4 Bit Rate Selection for Opportunistic
Routing
In Section 5.1, we examined the beneﬁts of opportunistic routing
when the entire network was operating at the same bit rate. In this
section, we allow APs to send at different bit rates. Because bit rate
adaptation in opportunistic routing is an open question, we do not
adapt a particular rate adaptation strategy. Instead, we examine the
improvements in a network with perfect knowledge about which bit
rate each AP should use.
Because we allow for variable bit rates, our deﬁnition of
ExOR(s → d) changes slightly; we refer to this new deﬁnition as
(cid:7)(s → d). Before calculating ExOR(s → d), we must calcu-
ExOR
(cid:7)(s → d, rate) for each bit rate that s can use. s’s bit rate
late ExOR
of choice will be the one that minimizes this value.
For a bit rate r, we ﬁrst determine the set C of neighbors of s that
are closer to d, but instead of using the ETX metric, we use the ETT

beneﬁts from opportunistic routing.

metric [6]4. Recall that the difference between the two is that ETT
takes into account the bit rate; thus, it reﬂects the expected amount
of time it will take to transmit a packet, not the expected number
of transmissions. Even though we are concentrating on a particular
bit rate r, we use ETT here, not ETX, to allow for the possibility of
the nodes in C sending at rates other than r. After all, r need not be
the bit rate for the entire path.

Fraction of Hidden Triples
Figure 15: Fraction of hidden triples to relevant triples at a
threshold of 10%.
Figure 14 shows the results using this method. The CDF is com-
parable to that in Figure 8; even with perfect knowledge of bit rates,
opportunistic routing offers little beneﬁt on most paths.
6. HIDDEN TRIPLES
Our next set of results relates to the likelihood of interference
from concurrent transmissions and how frequent hidden terminals
are at each bit rate. In Section 4 we examined the performance of
various bit rate adaptation schemes. Even with an ideal rate adapta-
tion algorithm, throughput can still be affected by interference from
hidden terminals. We estimate the frequency of hidden terminals in
this section, using networks with at least 10 APs.
Since a hidden terminal is a property of the MAC protocol, which
in turn depends on how the carrier sense thresholds are picked and
the method used for carrier sense, we investigate the occurrence of
hidden triples. We deﬁne a hidden triple as follows. A triple of
APs, (cid:2)AP1, AP2, AP3(cid:3), in a network is a hidden triple at a bit rate
b if AP2 can hear both AP1 and AP3 at bit rate b, but neither AP1
nor AP3 can hear each other when sending at bit rate b. We deﬁne
AP1’s and AP2’s ability to hear one another at bit rate b based on a
threshold t: if we observe that AP1 and AP2 could hear more than t
percent of the probes sent between them at bit rate b, then AP1 and
AP2 can hear each other; otherwise, they cannot.
We are interested in what fraction of triples in a network are
hidden triples at each bit rate. It is not particularly interesting to
determine what fraction of all triples are hidden triples, since three
APs that are far from each other are not likely to become hidden
terminals or interfere appreciably with one another.
Instead, we
want to know what fraction of relevant triples are hidden triples.
We deﬁne a relevant triple (cid:2)AP1, AP2, AP3(cid:3) as one where AP1 and
AP3 can both hear AP2; AP1 and AP3 may or may not be able to hear
each other. If they cannot, we have a hidden triple.
