# Security rapid modernization plan
This rapid modernization plan (RAMP) will help you quickly adopt Microsoft's recommended [privileged access strategy](privileged-access-strategy.md).
This roadmap builds on the technical controls established in the [privileged access deployment](privileged-access-deployment.md) guidance. Complete those steps and then use the steps in this RAMP to configure the controls for your organization.  
![Privileged access RAMP summary](./media/security-rapid-modernization-plan/privileged-access-ramp-summary.png)
> [!NOTE]
> Many of these steps will have a green/brownfield dynamic as organizations often have security risks in the way they are already deployed or configured accounts. 
> This roadmap prioritizes stopping the accumulation of new security risks first, and then later cleans up the remaining items that have already accumulated.
As you progress through the roadmap, you can utilize Microsoft Secure Score to track and compare many items in the journey with others in similar organizations over time. Learn more about Microsoft Secure Score in the article [Secure score overview](/microsoft-365/security/defender/microsoft-secure-score).
Each item in this RAMP is structured as an initiative that will be tracked and managed using a format that builds on the objectives and key results (OKR) methodology. Each item includes what (objective), why, who, how, and how to measure (key results). Some items require changes to processes and people's knoweldge/skills, while others are simpler technology changes. Many of these initiatives will include members outside of the traditional IT Department that should be included in the decision making and implementation of these changes to ensure they are successfully integrated in your organization. 
It is critical to work together as an organization, create partnerships, and educate people who traditionally were not part of this process. It is critical to create and maintain buy-in across the organization, without it many projects fail.
## Separate and manage privileged accounts
### Emergency access accounts
- **What**: Ensure that you are not accidentally locked out of your Microsoft Entra organization in an emergency situation. 
- **Why**: Emergency access accounts rarely used and highly damaging to the organization if compromised, but their availability to the organization is also critically important for the few scenarios when they are required. Ensure you have a plan for continuity of access that accommodates both expected and unexpected events. 
- **Who**: This initiative is typically led by [Identity and Key Management](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-security-identity-keys) and/or [Security Architecture](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-security-architecture).
   - **Sponsorship:** This initiative is typically sponsored by CISO, CIO, or Director of Identity
   - **Execution:** This initiative is a collaborative effort involving
     - [Policy and standards](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-security-policy-standards) team document clear requirements and standards
     - [Identity and Key Management](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-security-identity-keys) or [Central IT Operations](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/central-it) to implement any changes
     - [Security Compliance management](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-security-compliance-management) monitors to ensure compliance
- **How**: Follow the guidance in [Manage emergency access accounts in Microsoft Entra ID](/azure/active-directory/roles/security-emergency-access).
- **Measure key results:**
   - **Established** Emergency access process has been designed based on Microsoft guidance that meets organizational needs
   - **Maintained** Emergency access has been reviewed and tested within the past 90 days
### Enable Microsoft Entra Privileged Identity Management
- **What**: Use Microsoft Entra Privileged Identity Management (PIM) in your Microsoft Entra production environment to discover and secure privileged accounts
- **Why**: Privileged Identity Management provides time-based and approval-based role activation to mitigate the risks of excessive, unnecessary, or misused access permissions.
- **Who**: This initiative is typically led by [Identity and Key Management](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-security-identity-keys) and/or [Security Architecture](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-security-architecture).
   - **Sponsorship:** This initiative is typically sponsored by CISO, CIO, or Director of Identity
   - **Execution:** This initiative is a collaborative effort involving
     - [Policy and standards](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-security-policy-standards) team document clear requirements and standards (based on this guidance)
     - [Identity and Key Management](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-security-identity-keys) or [Central IT Operations](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/central-it) to implement any changes
     - [Security Compliance management](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-security-compliance-management) monitors to ensure compliance
- **How**: Deploy and Configure Microsoft Entra Privileged Identity Management using the guidance in the article, [Deploy Microsoft Entra Privileged Identity Management (PIM)](/azure/active-directory/privileged-identity-management/pim-deployment-plan).
- **Measure key results**: 100% of applicable privileged access roles are using Microsoft Entra PIM
### Identify and categorize privileged accounts (Microsoft Entra ID)
- **What**: Identify all roles and groups with high business impact that will require privileged security level (immediately or over time). These administrators will require sparate accounts in a later step [Privileged access administration](critical-impact-accounts.md#separate-accounts-for-admins).
- **Why**: This step is required to identify and minimize the number of people that require separate accounts and privileged access protection
- **Who**: This initiative is typically led by [Identity and Key Management](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-security-identity-keys) and/or [Security Architecture](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-security-architecture).
   - **Sponsorship:** This initiative is typically sponsored by CISO, CIO, or Director of Identity
   - **Execution:** This initiative is a collaborative effort involving
     - [Policy and standards](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-security-policy-standards) team document clear requirements and standards (based on this guidance)
     - [Identity and Key Management](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-security-identity-keys) or [Central IT Operations](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/central-it) to implement any changes
     - [Security Compliance management](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-security-compliance-management) monitors to ensure compliance
- **How**: After turning on Microsoft Entra Privileged Identity Management, view the users who are in the following Microsoft Entra roles at a minimum based on your organizations risk policies:
  - Global administrator
  - Privileged role administrator
  - Exchange administrator
  - SharePoint administrator
  For a complete list of administrator roles, see [Administrator role permissions in Microsoft Entra ID](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference).
   > Remove any accounts that are no longer needed in those roles. Then, categorize the remaining accounts that are assigned to admin roles:
   >
   > - Assigned to administrative users, but also used for non-administrative productivity purposes, like reading and responding to email.
   > - Assigned to administrative users and used for administrative purposes only
   > - Shared across multiple users
   > - For break-glass emergency access scenarios
   > - For automated scripts
   > - For external users
If you don't have Microsoft Entra Privileged Identity Management in your organization, you can use the PowerShell API. Also start with the Global Administrator role, because a Global Administrator has the same permissions across all cloud services for which your organization has subscribed. These permissions are granted no matter where they were assigned: in the Microsoft 365 admin center, the Azure portal, or by the Azure AD module for Microsoft PowerShell.
- **Measure key results:** Review and Identification of privileged access roles has been completed within the past 90 days
### Separate accounts (On-premises AD accounts)
- **What**: Secure on-premises privileged administrative accounts, if not already done. This stage includes:
   - Creating separate admin accounts for users who need to conduct on-premises administrative tasks
   - Deploying Privileged Access Workstations for Active Directory administrators
   - Creating unique local admin passwords for workstations and servers
- **Why**: Hardening the accounts used for administrative tasks. The administrator accounts should have mail disabled and no personal Microsoft accounts should be allowed.
- **Who**: This initiative is typically led by [Identity and Key Management](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-security-identity-keys) and/or [Security Architecture](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-security-architecture).
   - **Sponsorship:** This initiative is typically sponsored by CISO, CIO, or Director of Identity
   - **Execution:** This initiative is a collaborative effort involving
     - [Policy and standards](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-security-policy-standards) team document clear requirements and standards (based on this guidance)
     - [Identity and Key Management](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-security-identity-keys) or [Central IT Operations](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/central-it) to implement any changes
     - [Security Compliance management](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-security-compliance-management) monitors to ensure compliance
- **How**: All personnel that are authorized to possess administrative privileges must have separate accounts for administrative functions that are distinct from user accounts. **Do not share these accounts between users.**
   - *Standard user accounts* - Granted standard user privileges for standard user tasks, such as email, web browsing, and using line-of-business applications. These accounts are not granted administrative privileges.
   - *Administrative accounts* - Separate accounts created for personnel who are assigned the appropriate administrative privileges. 
- **Measure key results:** 100% of on-premises privileged users have separate dedicated accounts
### Microsoft Defender for Identity
- **What**: Microsoft Defender for Identity combines on-premises signals with cloud insights to monitor, protect, and investigate events in a simplified format enabling your security teams to detect advanced attacks against your identity infrastructure with the ability to:
    - Monitor users, entity behavior, and activities with learning-based analytics
    - Protect user identities and credentials stored in Active Directory
    - Identify and investigate suspicious user activities and advanced attacks throughout the kill chain
    - Provide clear incident information on a simple timeline for fast triage 
- **Why**: Modern attackers may stay undetected for long periods of time. Many threats are hard to find without a cohesive picture of your entire identity environment.
- **Who**: This initiative is typically led by [Identity and Key Management](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-security-identity-keys) and/or [Security Architecture](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-security-architecture).
   - **Sponsorship:** This initiative is typically sponsored by CISO, CIO, or Director of Identity
