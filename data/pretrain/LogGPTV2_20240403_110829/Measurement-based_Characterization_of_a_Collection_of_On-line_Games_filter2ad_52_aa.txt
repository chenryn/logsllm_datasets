Abstract
On-line games are a rapidly growing Internet application.
Because of the cost in supporting on-line games and the un-
predictable load on servers, companies are moving toward
sharing infrastructure for game hosting. To efﬁciently pro-
vision on-line games, it is important to understand game
workloads and the behavior of game players. In this pa-
per, we present a comprehensive analysis of a collection
of on-line game players and game workloads using data
from several sources including: a 13-month trace of an ex-
tremely busy game server containing over 2.8 million con-
nections, a two-year trace of the aggregate game popula-
tions of over 550 on-line games, and a 4-month trace of
a content-distribution network used to deliver games. The
key ﬁndings from our measurement study are: (1) these
gamers are an extremely difﬁcult set of users to satisfy and
unless game servers are properly set up and provisioned,
gamers quickly choose to go elsewhere, (2) the popularity
of these games follows a power law making games difﬁ-
cult to provision at launch time, (3) game workloads are
predictable only over short-term intervals, (4) there are sig-
niﬁcant challenges in hosting games on shared infrastruc-
ture due to temporal and geographic synchronization across
different games and other interactive applications, and (5)
game software updates are a signiﬁcent burden on game
hosting that must be planned for. Our results have impli-
cations for both game publishers as well as infrastructure
providers.

Introduction
On-line gaming is an increasingly popular form of enter-
tainment on the Internet, with the on-line market predicted
to be worth over $5 billion dollars in 2008 [1]. As an ex-
ample of a popular, money-making game, EverQuest [2]
has over 450,000 subscribers each paying a monthly fee
and purchasing two yearly expansions. Unfortunately for
game companies, the success of a game is highly unpre-
dictable. To make matters worse, there are substantial
costs in developing and hosting on-line games. As a re-
sult, such companies are increasingly exploring shared,
on-line hosting platforms such as on-demand computing
infrastructure provided by companies such as IBM and
HP [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].
In order to judge the feasibility of such an approach, it
is important for game and hosting companies to understand
how gamers and game workloads behave. Knowing the be-
havior of players, the predictability of workloads, and the
potential for resource sharing between applications allows
infrastructure to be tailored to the needs of games. While
there has been a substantial amount of work characterizing
web and peer-to-peer users and workloads [11, 12], there is
very little known about game players and workloads.
In order to provide insight into such issues, this paper ex-
amines several large traces of aggregate player populations
of a collection of popular games as well as the individual
player population of a busy game server. We present a de-
tailed analysis of on-line game players and workloads that
targets several key areas which are important to game and
hosting providers including:
• How easy is it to satisfy gamers?: One of the key
issues in providing a successful game is to understand
how players connect to servers and how long they play
on them. By understanding what players are willing
to put up with, game and hosting companies can tailor
their infrastructure and content to maximize player
satisfaction. For example, one of the challenges with
using on-demand computing infrastructure for games
is the latency associated with re-purposing a server. It
would thus be useful to characterize how patient game
players are in connecting to a game before deploying
such infrastructure. To this end, we characterize
individual player behavior of an extremely popular
Counter-Strike game server over a long period of
time. Our results show that gamers are an extremely
difﬁcult set of users to satisfy and that unless game

quickly choose to go elsewhere.
• How predictable are game workloads? Another
problem in hosting on-line games is determining
the amount of hardware and network bandwidth
that is required. Hosting a game is an expensive
proposition, costing the game provider more than
30% of the subscription fees in just hardware and
bandwidth per month [13]. Hosting is made all the
more difﬁcult by variations of popularity as the game
moves through its life cycle. Game companies face
the provisioning problem both in determining the
amount of resources to provide at launch time and in
allocating spare resources to support dynamic usage
spikes and subscriber growth. Characterizing the
diversity and predictability of game workloads allows
companies to more accurately provision resources.
To this end, we examine the real-time aggregate
game player population of more than 550 on-line
games, the most popular of which are ﬁrst-person
shooters. Our results show that the popularity of
these games follows a distinct power law distribution
making the provisioning of resources at launch-time
extremely difﬁcult. However, as games mature,
their aggregate populations do become predictable,
allowing game and hosting companies to more easily
allocate resources to meet demand.
• Can infrastructure be shared amongst game and
other interactive applications? With the advent of
commercial on-demand computing infrastructure, it
is becoming possible to statistically multiplex server
resources across a range of diverse applications,
thus reducing the overall hardware costs required
to run them. In order for such shared infrastructure
to provide any savings, peak usage of applications
must not coincide. To characterize the amount of
sharing beneﬁt that is available, we examine the usage
behavior of a number of popular on-line games and
compare them against each other and against the
usage behavior of several large distributed web sites.
As on-demand infrastructure is distributed, we also
examine the client load of a number of servers based
on geographic region. Our results show that usage
behavior of interactive applications follows strict,
geographically-determined, time-of-day patterns with
limited opportunities for resource sharing.

2 Methodology
The study of on-line game usage is typically limited due
to the proprietary nature of the industry. To overcome this,
we have collected several unique data sets that allow us to
analyze properties that have not been possible previously.
These data sets include the following:
Individual player data: In order to study the behavior of
individual players playing a representative on-line game,
we examined the activity of one of the busiest and longest
running Counter-Strike servers in the country located at
cs.mshmro.com [14, 15]. Counter-Strike (a Half-Life
modiﬁcation) is currently the dominant on-line game with
the largest service footprint of any game at 35,000 servers
and over 4.5 billion player minutes per month [16]. Of all
of the active Counter-Strike servers, cs.mshmro.com is
among the busiest 20 servers as ranked by ServerSpy [17].
The server averages more than 40,000 connections per
week, has hosted more than 400,000 unique players within
the last year, and has logged more than 60 player years in
activity since its launch in August 2001. Table 1 describes
the trace collected from the server.
GameSpy aggregate player population data: One prob-
lem with measuring on-line game usage is the limited ac-
cess to game server hosting data. Game companies typi-
cally keep the access and usage behavior of their players
conﬁdential. There are two factors that enable the mea-
surement of aggregate game player populations, however:

(1) on-line games use a centralized authentication server to
keep track of the players that are playing and (2) informa-
tion on overall player numbers per game is usually exported
publicly. Several game portal services collect such player
numbers over a large number of games and report the infor-
mation in real-time. Among these services is the GameSpy
network, which provides real-time player population data
on individual games in a structured format that can readily
collected and analyzed [18]. Currently, there are over 550
on-line games that are being tracked across various gen-
res including ﬁrst-person shooter games (FPS), massively
multi-player on-line role-playing games (MMORPG), real-
time strategy games (RTS), card and board games, and
sports games. The most popular games tracked by the
Gamespy network are from the FPS genre however, and
therefore when we refer to gamers we are predominately
referring to FPS gamers. To study on-line game population
behavior, we have collected a data feed from GameSpy for
more than two years since November 2002. Our redundant
collection facility periodically samples the GameSpy data
every 10 minutes. Note that the availability of the data is
sensitive to many factors, including service outages at the
portal and our own outages. These outages have been man-
ually removed from the data analysis. Table 1 describes the
data set which includes over 50 million measurements and
represents more than 300,000 years of player time spent on
games over the course of the last two years.
Content-distribution network: One of the common fea-
tures of on-line games is their ability to dynamically update
themselves. To support this feature, many games employ
custom, game-speciﬁc, content distribution networks that
deliver new game content and software patches to clients
when needed. One such network is Steam [19], a multi-
purpose, content-distribution network run by Valve which
is used to distribute run-time security modules as well as
client and server software patches for Half-Life and its
mods such as Counter-Strike and Day of Defeat. The net-
work consistently delivers several Gbps of content spread
across over 100 servers. In order to analyze the resource us-
age of Steam, we have collected its data feed over the last
6 months, a duration that has seen Steam deliver more than
6 petabytes of data. Table 1 describes the trace collected.
3 Gamers as individuals
It is important for game providers to understand the usage
behavior of its players in order to adequately address their
needs. In order to study player characteristics, we analyze
the trace of cs.mshmro.com to track individual gamers
throughout their play cycle. Speciﬁcally, we track gamers
attempting to connect to the server, gamers playing on the
server, and the likelihood of a gamer returning to the server.
We ﬁrst demonstrate that gamers are difﬁcult to please.

acceptable reconnects
In particular, they 1) have no tolerance for busy servers,
often connecting once while the server is busy and never
reconnecting again for the entire trace, 2) have very speciﬁc
gameplay needs and if those needs are not met in the ﬁrst
few minutes of play, their likelihood of continuing to play
at the server drops off dramatically, and 3) they often have
no loyalty or sense of community tied to a speciﬁc server
and do not return after playing a handful of times. For those
that do return often, we also demonstrate that their session
times show a marked decline and their session interarrival
times show a marked increase just as they are ready to quit
playing on the server altogether.
3.1 Gamers are impatient when connecting
Quantifying the patience of on-line gamers is important for
adequate server provisioning. For some Internet applica-
tions, such as web-browsing, users are known to be impa-
tient [20]. For others, such as peer-to-peer services such as
