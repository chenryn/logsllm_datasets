## Abstract
Online games are a rapidly growing Internet application. The high costs associated with supporting online games and the unpredictable load on servers have led companies to explore shared infrastructure for game hosting. To efficiently provision online games, it is crucial to understand game workloads and player behavior. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of online game players and workloads using data from several sources, including a 13-month trace of a highly active game server, a two-year trace of the aggregate populations of over 550 online games, and a 4-month trace of a content-distribution network used to deliver games.

Key findings from our measurement study include:
1. Gamers are a challenging group to satisfy, and if game servers are not properly set up and provisioned, they quickly switch to other games.
2. Game popularity follows a power law distribution, making it difficult to provision resources at launch time.
3. Game workloads are predictable only over short-term intervals.
4. Hosting games on shared infrastructure poses significant challenges due to temporal and geographic synchronization across different games and other interactive applications.
5. Game software updates are a substantial burden on game hosting and must be carefully planned.

These results have implications for both game publishers and infrastructure providers.

## 1. Introduction
Online gaming is an increasingly popular form of entertainment on the Internet, with the market predicted to be worth over $5 billion in 2008 [1]. For example, EverQuest [2] has over 450,000 subscribers, each paying a monthly fee and purchasing yearly expansions. However, the success of a game is highly unpredictable, and the costs of developing and hosting online games are substantial. As a result, companies are exploring shared, online hosting platforms such as on-demand computing infrastructure provided by companies like IBM and HP [3-10].

To determine the feasibility of such an approach, it is essential for game and hosting companies to understand how gamers and game workloads behave. Knowing player behavior, workload predictability, and the potential for resource sharing between applications allows infrastructure to be tailored to the needs of games. While there has been extensive work characterizing web and peer-to-peer users and workloads [11, 12], little is known about game players and workloads.

This paper examines large traces of aggregate player populations from a collection of popular games and the individual player population of a busy game server. We present a detailed analysis of online game players and workloads, focusing on key areas important to game and hosting providers:

- **Player Satisfaction:** Understanding how players connect to servers and how long they play is crucial for providing a successful game. Our analysis of an extremely popular Counter-Strike game server shows that gamers are a challenging group to satisfy and will quickly leave if servers are not properly set up and provisioned.
- **Workload Predictability:** Determining the required hardware and network bandwidth for hosting a game is expensive. Game companies face the challenge of provisioning resources at launch time and allocating spare resources to support dynamic usage spikes and subscriber growth. Our analysis of the real-time aggregate game player population of over 550 online games reveals that game popularity follows a power law distribution, making initial provisioning difficult. However, as games mature, their populations become more predictable.
- **Infrastructure Sharing:** With the advent of commercial on-demand computing infrastructure, it is possible to multiplex server resources across diverse applications, reducing overall hardware costs. To assess the potential for resource sharing, we compare the usage behavior of popular online games and several large distributed websites. Our results show that the usage behavior of interactive applications follows strict, geographically determined, time-of-day patterns, limiting opportunities for resource sharing.

## 2. Methodology
Studying online game usage is typically limited by the proprietary nature of the industry. To overcome this, we collected several unique data sets that allow us to analyze properties previously unexplored. These data sets include:

- **Individual Player Data:** We examined the activity of one of the busiest and longest-running Counter-Strike servers, cs.mshmro.com [14, 15]. This server averages over 40,000 connections per week, has hosted over 400,000 unique players, and has logged more than 60 player years of activity since its launch in August 2001.
- **GameSpy Aggregate Player Population Data:** We collected a data feed from GameSpy, which provides real-time player population data for over 550 online games. Our data set includes over 50 million measurements and represents more than 300,000 years of player time spent on games over the last two years.
- **Content-Distribution Network (CDN) Data:** We analyzed the data feed from Steam, a content-distribution network used to deliver new game content and software patches. Over six months, Steam delivered more than 6 petabytes of data.

## 3. Gamers as Individuals
Understanding the usage behavior of players is essential for game providers to meet their needs. We analyzed the trace of cs.mshmro.com to track individual gamers throughout their play cycle. Specifically, we tracked gamers attempting to connect to the server, playing on the server, and the likelihood of returning to the server.

### 3.1. Gamers are Impatient When Connecting
Quantifying the patience of online gamers is important for adequate server provisioning. Our analysis shows that gamers:
- Have no tolerance for busy servers, often connecting once while the server is busy and never reconnecting again.
- Have very specific gameplay needs, and if these needs are not met in the first few minutes, their likelihood of continuing to play drops significantly.
- Often have no loyalty or sense of community tied to a specific server and do not return after playing a handful of times.
- For those who do return often, their session times show a marked decline, and their session interarrival times increase just before they quit playing on the server altogether.

## 4. Trends in Online Gaming
In this section, we describe the trends observed in the aggregate behavior of online gaming. Our analysis of the GameSpy data set reveals that the popularity of games follows a power law distribution, making it challenging to provision resources at launch time. However, as games mature, their populations become more predictable, allowing for better resource allocation.

## 5. Potential for Multiplexing Games and Web Traffic
We evaluate the potential for multiplexing games and web traffic together. Our analysis of the usage behavior of popular online games and several large distributed websites shows that the usage behavior of interactive applications follows strict, geographically determined, time-of-day patterns, limiting opportunities for resource sharing.

## 6. Conclusions
Our study provides valuable insights into the behavior of online game players and workloads. Key findings include the difficulty in satisfying gamers, the unpredictability of game workloads, and the challenges in hosting games on shared infrastructure. These results have important implications for both game publishers and infrastructure providers.
