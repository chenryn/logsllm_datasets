HID offers a dual technology Proximity & MIFARE card. A sector
of the MIFARE portion of the card can be programmed with the
same HID proximity format you use today! The HID Proximity &
MIFARE card offers an excellent solution for customers who are
transitioning from one technology to another, or who are using
smart card and proximity applications simultaneously.
