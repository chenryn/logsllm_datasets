Abstract  –  This  paper  briefly  explains  how  the  U.S.
military  currently  implements  secure  networks  internally
and with multi-national alliance partners, the  limitations
of 
implementations,  and  proposes  an
architecture  to  overcome  these  problems.  The  proposed
architecture provides a secure, environment that does not
require  all  members  to  be  treated  as  peers  and  allows
different private  communities.  The  proposed  architecture
is not necessarily the only or the best architecture, but is a
starting  point  for  discussion  and  provides  the  research
and private computer communities with an insight into the
military’s  unique  problems.  Many  of  the  concepts  or
requirements  discussed  in  the  paper  can  be  directly
applied to the commercial sector.
1. Introduction
For the military, the post-Cold War era presents many
different  and  complex  problems  that  were  unimagined
during the previous four decades. These problems apply to
many facets of the  military-industrial complex, including
how  to  apply  cryptography  to  meet  the  needs  of  the
military  commander  in  the  post  Cold  War  political
environment. Throughout the Cold War, there were clear
definitions of which countries were our friends and allies
and  which  countries  were  either  neutral  or  not  friendly.
Under  these  Cold  War  alliances,  if  a  country  decided  to
release information to its alliance, all alliance partners had
equal access to the information. These basic rules applied
to  both  “sides”  during  the  Cold  War.1  Today’s  political

commanders,

it  provides  an  entirely  new 
Many  of  these  new  security  challenges  are  only  now
being grasped, and the complexities are far reaching. The
advent  of  electronic  mail  and  the  World-Wide–Web
(WWW)  complicates  matters  even  more.  The  United
States  military takes Internet-based electronic  mail,  web-
browsing,  and  many  other  actions  for  granted.  It  is
extremely  difficult  to  exchange  classified  email  with
foreign countries using accredited and certified systems. It
is  more  problematic  to  provide  web  browsing  capability
across  security  domains.  The  result  is  either  separately
encrypted  bilateral  networks  with  each  nation  or  a  large
multi-lateral  peer  network.  Bilateral  connections  have  a
high  maintenance  cost  and  reduce  interoperability  for
multi-lateral operations. Similarly, one large peer network
enhances interoperability, but the utility of a peer network
is  reduced  because  all  information  is  implicitly  available
to all network members—and not every network member
wants  to  share  information  equally.  These  problems  are
particularly  vexing  for  the  United  States  in  the  Pacific
region. With over forty countries in the region, the Pacific
Command  includes  countries  that  are  old  friends,  new
friends,  neutral,  old

relationships, and a few clearly unfriendly countries. The
core problem is how to provide a system that is accessible
from  U.S.-only  classified  systems,  provides  different

alliance relationship.

levels of classified allied connections, and quickly allows
partners  to  voluntarily—and  involuntarily—connect  and
disconnect from the network.
This  paper  discusses  these  network  security  issues  in
the  next  four  sections.  Section  2  provides  background
information  on  typical  data  security  methods  developed
and used by the United States during the Cold War, many
of which are still in use today. Section 3 briefly discusses
problems caused by our current implementation strategies.
In Section 4, I propose an alliance data network that meets
most  or  all  of  the  requirements  from  Section  3.  Finally,
Section 5 concludes by discussing potential problems and
by  showing  how  the  proposed  security  architecture  not
only  applies  to  military  alliances  but  has  commercial
applications as well.
2. Background
During  the  Cold  War,  the  Soviet  Union  and  its
immediate  allies  posed  the  greatest  threat  to  the  United
States  and  its  partners.  While  the  United  States  and  its
allies  engaged  in  peripheral  or  proxy  conflicts  with  the
Soviets  in  Korea,  Vietnam,  Malaysia,  Yemen,  and  other
countries,  the  main  focus  was  always  on  Europe.  The
United  States  closest  Cold  War  allies  were  those  in  the
North  Atlantic  Treaty  Organization  (NATO).  Because  of
this focus on Europe and NATO, U.S. policy for release of
classified information was arranged to support the NATO
model.  The  basic  assumptions  for  the  NATO  classified
information  release  model  are  that  information  released
within  NATO  is  freely  available  to  all  NATO  partners,
and that partners do not connect and disconnect from the
the  NATO  network 
is  a  peer
network—essentially, 
network with a constant set of known partners.
In  addition  to  the  NATO  alliance  network,  most
NATO  countries  also  maintained  separate,  private,
classified  network(s)  for  their  internal  use.  With  the
advent of the Internet and the WWW, many military units
also  gained  access  to  unclassified  public  networks.
Because simple and reliable multi-level security operating
systems were not readily available, having access to three
networks  (alliance  classified,  internal  classified,  and
unclassified)  meant  having 
three  or  more  separate
networks with as many sets of user terminals. The United
States was no exception to this arrangement, nor have any
of these arrangements changed since the end of the Cold
War.  Table  1  shows  the  primary  components  of  the
current U.S. network security architecture.

In  Table  1  there  are  four  network  security  levels  on
four  unique  physical  networks.  The 
lowest  U.S.
government  network  security  classification  level  is  the
internal  U.S.  government  unclassified  network.  It  uses
TCP/IP  as  a  transport  and  networking  protocol  and  is
called  the  NIPRNET  (National  IP  Routed  Network).
Direct connectivity between the NIPRNET and the global
Internet  is  achieved  through  several  portals.  The  next
U.S.-only  network  is  the  SECRET 
level  SIPRNET
(SECRET  IP  Routed  Network).  From  a  U.S.  security
viewpoint, most SECRET level coalition networks reside
between  these  two  U.S.-only  systems.  These  coalition
networks  contain  information  the  individual  coalition
members decide to release to the other coalition members.
Besides  having  separate  networks  for  the  different
classification  levels,  U.S.  and  alliance  networks  are
encrypted  using  secret  key,  bulk  encryption  devices
between  transmission  nodes.2  Special  communications
sections are responsible for maintaining the networks, the
communications links, and the encryption systems. Users
normally  assume  that  any  traffic  on  the  network  is  safe
from  any  outside  eavesdropper.  Obviously,  encryption
between transmission nodes does not address any insider
threat because the local area networks are not encrypted,
although they are physically protected.
2 Secret key systems rely on a key that is known only to the parties
sending and receiving the message; compromising a secret key allows all
encrypted traffic to be read. These secret key systems are in contrast to
newer public key systems that use large prime numbers to give every
user a public key and a private key. Secret key systems typically have a
higher throughput than public key systems. For additional information
see [7, 8, and 9].
The  first  problem  of  this  arrangement  is  the  financial
cost  of  accessing  the  multiple  networks.  Few  military
units  or  government  organizations  have  the  money  to
provide users  with three or  more  separate  network  drops
and  terminals.  Most  units  must  choose  which  network
they  will  use  (NIPRNET,  SIPRNET,  or  alliance),  and
provide computers to everyone on that network. Access to
the  other  networks  is  provided  through  common  use
terminals.  This  arrangement  causes  problems  because
users must go to another location, wait for a free terminal,
and  log  in.  While  this  situation  can  be  remedied  with
multi-level  security  (MLS)  operating  systems, 
these
products  are  few  in  number,  and  are  neither  inexpensive
nor easy to use.
Another difficulty of the arrangement becomes evident
when a user tries to move data from one security level to
the  next.  When  a  user  wants  to  move  information  on  a
computer  from  one  security  classification  level  to  a
computer  or  network  on  another  classification  level,  the
bytes  associated  with  the  information  may  be  moved  in
one  of  two  ways.  The  data  can  be  moved  either  directly
from one level to the next via the time tested “sneaker net”
or through a guard (manual or electronic) connecting the
security  levels.  The  former  requires  a  user  to  copy  files
from one computer network to removable media (usually
a floppy disk), and physically move the disk to a computer
on another network with a different security classification.
The manual guard mechanisms use the traditional “man in
the loop” to verify traffic and pass it between the networks
using  a  special  workstation  connected  to  both  networks.
The  manual  guard  introduces  the  problem  of  the  “man”
being unable to place information in context. Additionally,
a person can be overwhelmed during high traffic periods.
The electronic guard mechanisms are more complex, have
a  higher  throughput  than  manual  guards,  but  have  their
own  unique  problems.  These  include  strict  formatting  to
pass  through  the  guard  and  the  ability  for  insiders  to
bypass the guard by removing the words and phrases the
electronic guard looks for.
