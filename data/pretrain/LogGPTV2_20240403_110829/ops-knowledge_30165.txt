User: I've installed anaconda on mavericks osx. When I'm trying to install ipython notebook from launcher app - it shows message that app is installing, but nothing happens after. Also links in launcher don't work and I can easily start ipython notebook from terminal. So I guess something wrong with launcher itself.
How can I fix it?
Assistant: Use  Anaconda full suite , that include installing all the tools and necessary packages ,it works fine for me , I didn't use the Launcher !
