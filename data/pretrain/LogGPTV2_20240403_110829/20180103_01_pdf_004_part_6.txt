6.4.7 Review classification results
Once the classification is complete, the settings window of the layer will display an error matrix of the
results. Earth Engine draws upon a portion of the training data to assess the validity of the classification and
to quantify errors of commission and omission.
Final classification using the Random Forest algorithm
Nearly 95% of the
Collect Earth
forest points fall
within areas
classified as
forest in the wall-
to-wall
classification.
# Points per
class in
Collect Earth
Omission error:
training data
2% of the Collect
Earth forest
points were
classified as
cropland in the
wall-to-wall
classification.
Commission error:
67% of the Collect Earth settlement points were classified as forest in the wall-to-wall
classification.
The results can inform further work in Collect Earth that may improve the accuracy of future classifications.
When reviewing classification results, consider the following key points:
Land use ≠ Land cover
Land cover is "the observed physical and biological cover of the earth's land, as vegetation or man-made
features." In contrast, land use is "the total of arrangements, activities, and inputs that people undertake in
a certain land cover type" (FAO, 1997a; FAO/UNEP, 1999).5
In Papua New Guinea, many settlements have been established in forest areas, which largely retain their
forest cover, but are interspersed with gaps in the canopy where dwellings constructed of forest materials
are visible. These forest settlements tend to be flanked by “gardens,” small-scale agricultural areas where
edible subsistence crops are grown. Many of these small-scale croplands retain some forest cover. The
Collect Earth sampling approach, which largely relies upon manual visual interpretation of high spatial
resolution imagery is well suited for detecting these types of settlements and croplands, which retain some
tree cover. In contrast, Earth Engine’s automated interpretation of medium resolution imagery is prone to
classify these areas with large amounts of tree cover as forest; hence the substantial commission error with
forest.

Classification objective
The validity of the classification is nearly 90%. While this figure is important, the validity of a particular class
may be of greater importance depending upon how the wall-to-wall classification will be used. If this
classification were intended to determine the spatial extent of forest and potential forest inventory sites,
this classification with 95% validity in the forest class might be suitable. However, a map with less than 50%
classification validity for the cropland, settlement and other land and would be inadequate for national
reporting of land use, land use change and forestry to the UNFCCC. This is particularly problematic because
such high levels of commission error with forest land is likely to inflate carbon stock values.
Stratified sampling and adequate sampling sizes
Drawing upon over one thousand training points, the Random Forest algorithm performs extremely well
when classifying forest areas. The remaining classes have 93% - 99.6% fewer training points, and
consequently, poorly defined class boundaries Increasing the number of training points for these under
represented classes through a stratified-random sampling scheme may improve the overall validity of the
classification.

7.1 Application and data folder
The Collect Earth installation (exe and other necessary files) and the data used by Collect Earth are stored in
different folders. This is a way to ensure easier and better procedures when upgrading the software.
Windows : C:\OpenForis\CollectEarth
Linux & Mac OS X : ~/OpenForis/CollectEarth
The database, logs and project files themselves are stored in these folders to separate from the installation
files:
Volume II: Collect Earth User Manual for Windows OS
Advanced Collect Earth functionalities 108
Windows:C:\Users\USER_NAME\AppData\Roaming\CollectEarth
(NOTE: If AppData folder isn’t visible, you might have to change your computers settings. Go to Files, select
the “View” tab at the top of the window and check “Hidden items”)
Linux : ~/CollectEarth
Mac OS X : ~/Library/Application Support/Collect Earth ( tip , to get to this folder : Open Finder, Click Apple
Key + Shift + G, you get a dialog, type ~ in the text field and click Ok (this will take you to your User’s home
folder) Then browse to Library->Application Support->Collect Earth )
The structure within this folder is:
 backupSQLite folder ( each time Collect Earth is closed a backup file of the database is stored here,
only the 10 last copies are stored )
 generated folder ( where the files that are automatically generated by Collect Earth reside. This
would include the KML and KMZ files that are generated when the Collect Earth properties are
changed )
 projects folder. This folder holds a copy of the extracted contents of each of the Collect Earth Project
files that have been imported into Collect Earth.
 collectEarthDatabase.db (if the SQLite option is enabled). This file contains all of the data that has
been collected within Collect Earth in this computer (for all the projects that the user has worked on)
 collectEarthDatabase.dbSaiku (if the SQLite option is enabled) this is the database file that is
generated before the Saiku analysis can run. If the contents of the Collect Earth database change,
this database should be refreshed.
 earth.properties file where all the possible properties to set Collect Earth are stored.
 earth_error.log the log file where the error messages generated by Collect Earth are stored.
7.2 Importing a KML with placemarks
This is a procedure mostly used for demonstration activities, as the operator/user can collect data on plots
that are located in areas that she might know first-hand.
The normal procedure to collect data in a statistically sound manner is to use a systematic or systematic-
random sampling design which allows you to have correct results.
7.2.1 Creating a .kml file in Google Earth
While in Google Earth, right click on the “My places” tab on the right hand side of the screen. Put your
mouse over “Add” and then click on “Folder”.
Volume II: Collect Earth User Manual for Windows OS
Advanced Collect Earth functionalities 109
Give the folder an appropriate name.
Then right click on the folder you just created and add a “Placemark”
Name it and drag it to the exact location you want it in. You can also input coordinates if you have any.
Click OK to save the placemark. If you
later on want to change the placemark’s
location, right click on the placemark
tab on the right and select “Properties”.
Create as many Placemarks as are
required.

7.2.2 Importing a .kml file to Collect Earth
In Collect Earth, select “Tools” from the small window and then click on “Import points from .KML”
Select “OK” on the pop-up window asking to select a location to save a CSV file to. Save the .csv file. Plot
grids should now appear on your placemarks. NOTE: Don’t change the placemarks’ locations after this.
NOTE: If you import your own kml data, you will only be able to use the number of plots as a variable in
SAIKU-calculations. Thus, you cannot for example use the area of the plots.

7.3 Find plots not yet assessed
When performing an assessment in a project that uses multiple sampling design files (grid or plot-location
files in CSV/CED format) it might be difficult to find out the plots whose information is not complete or have
not yet been assessed at all. This tedious process would involve going though each of the CSV/CSD files and
then making a note of the missing plots.
With the “Find missing plots in database” you can automatize this process and even obtain a files that only
contains the plots that need to be assessed in order to finalize an exercise.
7.3.1 Preparations
In Collect Earth, select “Tools” and then select “Find missing plots in database”
Select the files with the plot locations (CSV or CED) you would like to check. You can select multiple ones at a
time. Click “Open” to start processing.
A pop up window appears containing, in a text format, all the plots that have data missing.
At the end of the pop up window’s text, you can see a summary of the number of missing plots.
Next, press the “Export to CED file” button at the bottom of the pop up. This creates a new .csv file that only
includes the plots with data missing. Name and save the resulting .csv file.

7.3.2 Importing the missing plots into Collect Earth
In Collect Earth, select “Tools” and then “Properties”.
A window will open named “Collect Earth options”. Now, to import you plots, select “Browse” and navigate
to your plot. Once opened, the data in the .csv file will show up as a table. Select “Save & Apply changes”
from the bottom of the screen.
The plots should appear shortly in Google Earth.

7.4 Printing out the application log
An application log is essentially a history of what the program has done. It can be useful in solving reasons
for error reports. If you submit a question to the developers about a crash or a problem, please include a
copy of your application log.
To find the application log in Collect Earth, select “Help” and then “Open application log file”.
A window will appear. If you wish to select the whole log, press CTRL + A. To copy the log, press CTRL + C.
CTRL + P will paste the copied log unto your message. The whole log is rarely relevant, however. Usually the
last few hundred rows are enough.
Additionally you can find the actual log file inside the data folder (see Application and Data Folder) named
earth_error.log
7.5 Updating Collect Earth
7.5.1 Updating automatically
If a newer version of Collect Earth is available and you are connected to the internet, the program will
automatically ask you if you want to update. Click on “Update now” to start the download for the update. If
you select “Do not remind me again”, the pop up will not appear on start up until a new version is released
again. If you select “Remind me later”, the pop up will show the next time you start Collect Earth.
As you see, you can view the date of the release of this newer version.
Volume II: Collect Earth User Manual for Windows OS
Advanced Collect Earth functionalities 115
The first step will be to download the updater, once it is downloaded the updater will refresh the contents
on the application folder. When the installation window appears, click “Next” until the window disappears.
7.5.2 Updating manually
If your Collect Earth is not set to check for updates automatically, you can update the program manually. To
do this; go to Collect Earth’s toolbar, select “Help” and then “Check for updates of Collect Earth”.
Volume II: Collect Earth User Manual for Windows OS
Advanced Collect Earth functionalities 116
7.6 Updating data on plots already collected
Sometimes data isn’t correct or collected right, or you might want to add new attributes to your plots. These
could be attributes like climate type and soil, for example. To do this, you must update your survey to
include these attributes.
NOTE: Only plots that are already in the database, i.e. plots that are fully (green) or partially (yellow)
collected and saved, can be updated. Empty plots won’t get the added features until there is some data on
them.
The new features are added by creating a CSV file. The file in this case must have three columns, one for the
plot IDs and one for each new attribute.
NOTE: The column headings must be written EXACTLY
as they are in Collect Earth survey (only lower case
letter, no spaces etc.)! The ID numbers must
correspond to the plots, otherwise the input
information is linked to the wrong plot.
When you have saved the CSV file, go to Collect Earth and select “Tools”, Data Import/Export” and then
“Update current records using CSV”.

7.7 Setting up a PostgreSQL database
http://www.openforis.org/support/questions/17/how-do-you-setup-collect-earth-in-postgresql-mode
By default Collect Earth is set up to use SQLite as the database that stores collected data.
In order to use a server-based solution (PostgreSQL) so that several PCs running Collect Earth can share the
same data, the user must set up the database connection.
7.7.1 Install PostgreSQL
Install PostgreSQL server (http://www.postgresql.org/) in a computer that can be reached by the other PCs,
whether through the internet or within an intranet.
After you install PostgreSQL run the pgAdmin III application that should also have been installed. It can be
found in C:\Program Files\postgresql*VERSION_NUMBER*\bin.
Create a new database.
To do this, double click
on an existing server. (If
no servers exist, you can
create a new one from
the “File” menu.)
Then, right click
“Databases” and select
“New Database”. Call the
database whatever you
like (CollectEarthDb, for
example).
Then add a new schema to the database, by right clicking it and selecting “New Schema”. Name it “collect”
(it is important that it’s named exactly that).
Volume II: Collect Earth User Manual for Windows OS
Advanced Collect Earth functionalities 118
You should also create a new Login Role (in the Login Roles branch under the server). You can call it
collect_client with password collect_pass, for example (this is set in the definition tab).
7.7.2 Configure the Database
By default PostgreSQL is setup so that the database cannot be accessed from outside the localhost (the
computer where the server is installed). In Windows we need to change this. Go the folder where the
PostgreSQL has been installed. By default it should be:
C:\ProgramFiles\postgresql*VERSION_NUMBER*\data
Open the file called pg_hba.conf and append this line to the list of accepted connections:
host all all 0.0.0.0/0 trust
Volume II: Collect Earth User Manual for Windows OS
Advanced Collect Earth functionalities 119
This means that the database now accepts connections from any IPs (you can tweak this to accept
connection only from your local network: see the documentation)
Now, in the same folder open the file postgresql.conf and change the line where it says listen_addresses. Set
it to: listen__addresses='*'
At this stage you need to restart PostgreSQL. Since it is installed as a service (usually) in Windows, the fastest
way is to just restart the computer.
7.7.3 Set up Collect Earth
Now you should open Collect Earth and got to the main menu Tools->Properties and then go to the
operation mode tab.
Volume II: Collect Earth User Manual for Windows OS
Advanced Collect Earth functionalities 120
In that tab fill the fields like in the image
attached (the XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX is your IP
address, you can find it out by typing IPCONFIG
in your computers command prompt).
Click on Save & Apply changes and now
you should see that Collect Earth has
populated the collect schema in the
Database with all the tables necessary
for the Collect to store data.
Now check that other users can connect to the database. If this does not happen, review that the
PostgreSQL Database is reachable from outside your PC. If the database can be accessed from outside the PC
then there might be a firewall configuration that is preventing the computer from connecting to the
PostgreSQL server.
