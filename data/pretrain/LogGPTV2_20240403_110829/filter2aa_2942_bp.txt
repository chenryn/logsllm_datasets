RISK DETERMINATION  
TASK 2-2: Determine the risk to enterprise operations and assets, individuals, other enterprises, 
and the Nation if identified threats exploit identified vulnerabilities.  
Supplemental Guidance 
Enterprises identify cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain by considering the 
likelihood that known threats exploit known vulnerabilities to and through the supply chain, as 
well as the resulting consequences or adverse impacts (i.e., magnitude of harm) if such 
exploitations occur. Enterprises use threat and vulnerability information with likelihood and 
consequences/impact information to determine C-SCRM risk either qualitatively or 
quantitatively. Outputs from the Risk Determination at Level 1 and Level 2 should correspond 
directly with the RMF Prepare – Enterprise Level tasks described in [NIST 800-37, Rev. 2], 
while risk assessments completed for Level 3 should correspond directly with the RMF Prepare – 
Operational Level tasks.  
Likelihood 
Likelihood is a weighted factor based on a subjective analysis of the probability that a given 
threat is capable of exploiting a given vulnerability [CNSSI 4009]. Determining this likelihood 
requires consideration of the characteristics of the threat sources, the identified vulnerabilities, 
and the enterprise’s susceptibility to the supply chain cybersecurity compromise prior to and 
while the safeguards or mitigations are implemented. Likelihood determination should draw on 
methodologies defined as part of the Frame step and update, refine, and expand any assumptions 
made about likelihood. For adversarial threats, this analysis should consider the degree of an

adversary’s capability and intent to interfere with the enterprise’s mission. A cybersecurity 
supply chain risk assessment should consider two views:  
1. The likelihood that one or more elements within the supply chain itself is compromised. 
This may impact, for example, the availability of quality components or increase the risk 
of intellectual property theft.  
2. The likelihood of the system or component within the supply chain being compromised, 
for example, by malicious code inserted into a system or an electrical storm damaging a 
component.  
In some cases, these two views may overlap or be indistinguishable, but both may have an 
impact on the agency’s ability to perform its mission. 
A likelihood determination should consider: 
• Threat assumptions that articulate the types of threats that the system or the component 
may be subject to, such as cybersecurity threats, natural disasters, or physical security 
threats 
• Actual supply chain threat information, such as adversaries’ capabilities, tools, intentions, 
and targets 
• Historical data about the frequency of supply chain events in peer or like enterprises 
• Internal expert perspectives on the probability of a system or process compromise 
through the supply chain 
• Exposure of components to external access (i.e., outside of the system boundary) 
• Identified system, process, or component vulnerabilities 
• Empirical data on weaknesses and vulnerabilities available from any completed analysis 
(e.g., system analysis, process analysis) to determine the probabilities of supply chain 
cybersecurity threat occurrence 
Factors for consideration include the ease or difficulty of successfully attacking through a 
vulnerability and the ability to detect the method employed to introduce or trigger a 
vulnerability. The objective is to assess the net effect of the vulnerability, which will be 
combined with threat information to determine the likelihood of successful attacks within a 
defined time frame as part of the risk assessment process. The likelihood can be based on threat 
assumptions or actual threat data, such as previous breaches of the supply chain, specific 
adversary capabilities, historical breach trends, or the frequency of breaches. The enterprise may 
use empirical data and statistical analysis to determine the specific probabilities of breach 
occurrence, depending on the type of data available and accessible within the enterprise. 
Impact 
Enterprises should begin impact analysis using methodologies and potential impact assumptions 
defined during the Frame step to determine the impact of a compromise and the impact of 
mitigating said compromise. Enterprises need to identify the various adverse impacts of 
compromise, including 1) the characteristics of the threat sources that could initiate the events, 2) 
identified vulnerabilities, and 3) the enterprise’s susceptibility to such events based on planned or

implemented countermeasures. Impact analysis is an iterative process performed initially when a 
compromise occurs, when a mitigation approach is decided to evaluate the impact of change, and 
in the ever-changing SDLC when the situation or context of the system or environment changes.  
Enterprises should use the results of an impact analysis to define an acceptable level of 
cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain related to a specific system. Impact is derived 
from criticality, threat, and vulnerability analysis results and should be based on the magnitude 
of effect on enterprise operations, enterprise assets, individuals, other enterprises, or the Nation 
(including the national security interests of the United States) of a loss of confidentiality, 
integrity, or availability of information or an information system [NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5]. 
Impact is likely to be a qualitative measure requiring analytic judgment. Executive/decision-
makers use impact as an input into risk-based decisions and whether to accept, avoid, mitigate, or 
share the resulting risks and the consequences of such decisions.  
Enterprises should document the overall results of assessments of cybersecurity risk throughout 
the supply chain in risk assessment reports.69 Cybersecurity supply chain risk assessment reports 
should cover risks in all three enterprise levels, as applicable. Based on the enterprise structure 
and size, multiple assessment reports on cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain may be 
required. Agencies are encouraged to develop individual reports at Level 1. For Level 2, 
agencies should integrate cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain into the respective 
mission-level business impact analysis (BIA) and may want to develop separate mission-level 
assessment reports on cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain. For Level 3, agencies 
may want to integrate cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain into the respective Risk 
Response Framework. Risk Response Frameworks at all three levels should be interconnected, 
reference each other when appropriate, integrate with the C-SCRM Plans, and comprise part of 
authorization packages.  
Aggregation 
Enterprises may use risk aggregation to combine several discrete or lower-level risks into a more 
general or higher-level risk [NIST SP 800-30, Rev. 1]. Risk aggregation is especially important 
for C-SCRM as enterprises strive to understand their risk exposure to the supply chain in contrast 
to assets at different levels of the organization. Ultimately, enterprises may wish to aggregate and 
normalize their C-SCRM risk assessment results with other enterprise risk assessments to 
develop an understanding of their total risk exposure across risk types (e.g., financial, 
operational, legal/regulatory). This aggregation may occur at an enterprise level in cases where 
the enterprise consists of multiple subordinate enterprises. Each subordinate enterprise would 
combine and normalize risks within a single enterprise risk register. Risk aggregation may also 
occur from Level 2 mission and business process level registers into a single Level 1 enterprise-
level risk register. To ease this process, enterprises should maximize inheritance of common 
frameworks and lexicons from higher-order risk processes (e.g., enterprise risk management).  
When dealing with discrete risks (i.e., non-overlapping), enterprises can more easily develop a 
holistic understanding of aggregate Level 1 and Level 2 risk exposures. In many cases, however, 
69 See [NIST SP 800-30, Rev. 1] Appendix K for a description of risk assessment reports.

enterprises will find that risk assessments completed at lower levels contain overlapping 
estimates for likelihood and impact magnitude. In these cases, the sum of the pieces (i.e., risk 
exposure ratings at lower levels) are greater than the whole (i.e., aggregate risk exposure of the 
enterprise). To overcome these challenges, enterprises can employ a variety of techniques. 
Enterprises may elect to use visualizations or heat maps to demonstrate the likelihood and impact 
of risks relative to one another. When presenting aggregate risk as a number, enterprises should 
ensure that assessments of risk produce discrete outputs by adopting mutually exclusive and 
collectively exhaustive (MECE) frameworks. MECE frameworks guide the analysis of inputs 
(e.g., threats, vulnerabilities, impacts) and allow the enterprise to minimize overlapping 
assumptions and estimates. Instead of summing risks from lower levels together, enterprises may 
elect to perform a new holistic assessment at an upper level that leverages the combined 
assessment results from lower levels. Doing so can help enterprises avoid double-counting risks, 
resulting in an overestimation of their aggregate risk exposure. Enterprises should apply 
discretion in aggregating risks so as to avoid risk aggregations that are difficult to explain (e.g., 
combining highly differentiated scenarios into a single number).  
Quantitative methods offer distinct advantages for risk aggregation. Through the use of 
probabilistic techniques (e.g., Monte Carlo methods, Bayesian analysis), enterprises can combine 
similar risks into a single, easily understood figure (e.g., dollars) in a mathematically defensible 
manner. Mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive frameworks remain an important 
requirement for quantitative methods.  
Outputs and Post Conditions  
This step results in: 
• Confirmed mission and business process criticality,  
• The establishment of relationships between the critical aspects of the system’s supply 
chain infrastructure (e.g., SDLC) and applicable threats and vulnerabilities,  
• Understanding of the likelihood and impact of a potential supply chain cybersecurity 
compromise,  
• Understanding mission and system-specific risks,  
• Documented assessments of cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain related to 
mission and business processes or individual systems, and 
• The integration of results of relevant assessments of cybersecurity risks throughout 
supply chain into the enterprise risk management process. 
Respond  
Inputs and Preconditions 
Respond is the step in which the individuals conducting the risk assessment will communicate 
the assessment results, proposed mitigation/controls options, and the corresponding acceptable 
level of risk for each proposed option to the decision makers. This information should be 
presented in an appropriate manner to inform and guide risk-based decisions. This will allow 
decision makers to finalize appropriate risk responses based on the set of options and the 
corresponding risk factors of choosing the various options. Sometimes, an appropriate response

is to simply monitor the adversary’s activities and behavior to better understand the tactics and 
activities.  
Cybersecurity supply chain risk response should be integrated into the overall enterprise risk 
response. Figure G-6 depicts the Respond step with its inputs and outputs along the three

Activities  
RISK RESPONSE IDENTIFICATION  
TASK 3-1: Identify alternative courses of action to respond to risks identified during the risk 
assessment. 
Enterprise’s risk response strategies will be informed by risk management strategies developed 
for the enterprise (i.e., Level 1) and mission and business processes (i.e., Level 2). Risk response 
strategies will include general courses of action that the enterprise may take as part of its risk 
response efforts (e.g., accept, avoid, mitigate, transfer or share). As part of mitigation efforts, 
enterprises should select C-SCRM controls and tailor these controls based on the risk 
determination. C-SCRM controls should be selected for all three levels, as appropriate per the 
findings of the risk assessments for each of the levels.  
Many of the C-SCRM controls included in this document may be part of an IT security plan and 
should be incorporated as requirements into agreements made with third-party providers. These 
controls are included because they apply to C-SCRM.  
This process should begin by determining acceptable risks to support the evaluation of 
alternatives (also known as trade-off analysis).  
EVALUATION OF ALTERNATIVES  
TASK 3-2: Evaluate alternative courses of action for responding to risk. 
Once an initial acceptable level of risk has been defined, risk response courses of action should 
be identified and evaluated for efficacy in enabling the enterprise to achieve its defined risk 
threshold. An evaluation of alternatives typically occurs at Level 1 or Level 2 with a focus on 
anticipated enterprise-wide impacts of C-SCRM on the enterprise’s ability to successfully carry 
out enterprise missions and processes. When carried out at Level 3, an evaluation of alternatives 
focuses on the SDLC or the amount of time available for implementing the course of action.  
Each course of action analyzed may include a combination of risk acceptance, avoidance, 
mitigation, transfer, and sharing. For example, an enterprise may elect to share a portion of its 
risk with a strategic supplier through the selection of controls included under contractual terms. 
Alternatively, an enterprise may choose to mitigate risks to acceptable levels through the 
selection and implementation of controls. In many cases, risk strategies will leverage a 
combination of risk response courses of action.  
During the evaluation of alternatives, the enterprise will analyze available risk response courses 
of action for identified cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain. The goal of this exercise 
is to enable the enterprise to achieve an appropriate balance between C-SCRM and the 
functionality needs of the enterprise. As a first step, enterprises should ensure that risk appetites 
and tolerances, priorities, trade-offs, applicable requirements, and constraints are reviewed with 
stakeholders who are familiar with the broader enterprise requirements, such as cost, schedule, 
performance, policy, and compliance. Through this process, the enterprise will identify risk

response implications to the enterprise’s broader requirements. Equipped with a holistic 
understanding of risk response implications, enterprises should perform the C-SCRM, mission, 
and operational-level trade-off analyses to identify the correct balance of C-SCRM controls to 
respond to risk. At Level 3, the Frame, Assess, Respond, and Monitor process feeds into the 
RMF Select step described in [NIST SP 800-37, Rev. 2].   
The selected C-SCRM controls for a risk response course of action will vary depending on where 
they are applied within enterprise levels and SDLC processes. For example, C-SCRM controls 
may range from using a blind buying strategy to the obscure end use of a critical component and 
design attributes (e.g., input validation, sandboxes, and anti-tamper design). For each 
implemented control, the enterprise should identify someone who will be responsible for its 
execution and develop a time- or event-phased plan for implementation throughout the SDLC. 
Multiple controls may address a wide range of possible risks. Therefore, understanding how the 
controls impact the overall risk is essential and must be considered before choosing and tailoring 
the combination of controls as yet another trade-off analysis may be needed before the controls 
can be finalized. The enterprise may be unknowingly trading one risk for a larger risk if the 
dependencies between the proposed controls and the overall risk are not well-understood and
