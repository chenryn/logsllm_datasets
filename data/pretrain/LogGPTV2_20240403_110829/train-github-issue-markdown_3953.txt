We're currently sitting at 1,809 open issues, a number which hasn't really
ever been useful to think about. The issue tracker seems to have three kinds
of bugs:
  * Questions, e.g. #22625, #22474, #22093, #22005
  * "Meta" bugs, e.g. #22475, #22221, #22172
  * Specific problems (almost all of the rest)
As far as I can tell, no one is taking specific action on anything here. The
oldest bugs are years old.
Feedback we've heard from contributors is that it's hard to "listen" for
discussion or bugs related to .d.ts files they've worked on. And as we can see
from the issue tracker, people who don't know how to contribute fixes aren't
really getting results from filing issues on the issue tracker.
What would a _useful_ DefinitelyTyped issue tracker look like?
