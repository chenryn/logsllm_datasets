varying from the original number generated with the al-
gorithm from Sec. 3.2 to a ﬁxed number of eight. The ﬁgure
shows how increasing state, i.e., number of layers, will give
more efﬁcient backup path routing.

4.3 Comparisons
In this section we make a comparison between the three
main approaches offering various recovery abstractions.
These are RRL, Protection Cycles and Redundant Trees.
Table 1 gives an overview for some relevant criteria. For
RRL, the numeric values have been evaluated using 100
Waxman networks with 16 nodes and 32 links. Statistics
on backup path lengths for RRL have been extracted from
ﬁgure 8 showing the backup path distributions for two RRL
alternatives when introducing link failures. We have used
link failures due to pcycles poor node failure handling.The
RRL alternative denoted min uses the original algorithm
presented in Sec. 3.2, while the RRL alternative denoted
5 generates about two more layers than the original. Vaules
for pcycle performance have been extracted from results
in [7]. The pcycle method denoted large attempts to build
few large cycles, and the method denoted small attempts to
make many small cycles to optimize the backup path length.
Statistics on RT backup path lengths have been collected
from [4]. Note that those numbers have been obtained based
on a single chordal ring topology.
The most important observations from table 1 is that the
number of recovery abstractions, i.e., layers, is very modest
for RRL compared to pcycles with many small cycles and
RT. Pcycles with a few large cycles, also provides few ab-
straction, however that comes with the expense of very long
backup paths. The number of abstractions for RT stems
from the fact that redundant trees must be built for every
candidate egress node. If not all 16 nodes will be egress
nodes, the number of abstractions will decrease.
When it comes to the additional state information im-
posed by the schemes, RRL requires at most ﬁxed ad-
ditional state proportional to the number of layers, while
pcycles requires at most additional state proportional to the
number of pcycles. Redundant Trees, on the other hand,
builds subtopologies that implicitly gives the routing, and
the state increase is constantly two.
For backup path lengths we observe that RRL performs
well, and also that the lengths can be decreased if the num-
ber of layers is increased.
None of the schemes affect the routing in the failure free
situation.
When it comes to coverage of the schemes, both RT and
RRL easily cover both link failures and node failures. P-
cycles is not designed for resisting node failures, however
there exist some very inefﬁcient ways of obtaining node
fault-tolerance [24].
From [4] and [24] we ﬁnd no obvious way RT and
pcycles can be applied to global recovery as has been de-
scribed for RRL.
For completeness, we mention that practical implement-
ations may be compared using other criteria, e.g., failure
detection time and notiﬁcation time. These criteria de-
pend however on implementation rather than the recovery
scheme.
To sum up we would like to point out that RRL seems
to give few simple and intuitive recovery abstractions of
the network. Coupled with acceptable backup path lengths,
ﬂexibility on global and local recovery, modest state in-
crease, and coverage of both node and link failures, RRL
provides a good alternative for practical handling of recov-
ery in packet networks.

5 Implementation issues in MPLS
Multiprotocol label switching (MPLS) is much used as a
framework for network recovery, and trafﬁc engineering in
general. In this section we demonstrate the applicability of
RRL for network protection within the MPLS framework.
We stress that our method is by no means bound to MPLS,
and may be applied to connectionless IP, Ethernet and other
technologies as well.
MPLS is a connection-oriented technology and adhere
therfore to the connection-oriented implemention require-
ments discussed in Sec. 3.1.2. As shown in Sec. 4, in most
cases as few as four layers sufﬁce to cover relatively large
networks. A network with four safe layers will calculate
the LSPs for ﬁve topologies, the ﬁfth topology being the
original, error-free one.
Another requirement imposed by RRL is that the node
carrying out the recovery action must know what LSPs are
affected by the failed node or link. Then, only the trafﬁc
from affected LSPs will be moved to backup LSPs. For
local recovery, the node detecting the failure is obviously
