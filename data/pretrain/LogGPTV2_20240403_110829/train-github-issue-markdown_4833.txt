using Michael's idea to create nodes uniquely,
    def prepare_add_user(id)
    # returns 0 when created and 1 if it was already there
    {:query=>
    "start n=node:node_auto_index(name={id}) 
     with count(*) as c 
     where c=0 
     create x={name:{id}} 
     return c", 
     :params => {:id => id}} 
    end
If you run this fast enough, you can manage to occasionally create two nodes
with the same id. This is not supposed to happen, right?
