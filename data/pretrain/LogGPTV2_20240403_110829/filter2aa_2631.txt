Example of Jailbreaking
app developers
jailbreak developers
(iPhone Dev Team)
end users
Jailbreaking and Licenses
SDK License
EULA
Jailbreaking and Licenses
What does it say about RE?
Are these enforceable contracts?
Did you click “I agree”?
Is a ban on reversing enforceable?
What’s your exposure for breach?
Jailbreaking and Licenses
Reverse engineering terms upheld:
Bowers v. Bay State
Davidson & Associates v. Jung (BNETD)
But then there’s Europe…

Why © is scarier than contract:
Statutory damages
Injunctions
Criminal penalties

Defenses for reverse engineers:
Section 107: Fair use
Section 117
Jailbreaking and ©
Fair Use
f reverse engineering is required to gain access to
unction and ideas, any intermediate copies made a
art of reverse engineering are fair use.
e sure that you are legitimately in possession of th
oftware, and do not copy code in your ﬁnal produc
nless necessary.
Jailbreaking and ©
Section 117
he owner of a copy of a computer program may
opy or adapt that program as “an essential step in
he utilization of the computer program with a
machine.”

Section 117
Are you the “owner” of the software?
s this an “adaptation” created as an “essential step”
f using the software?
Jailbreaking and DMCA
Section 1201 Prohibitions:
Acts of Circumvention
Trafﬁcking in Circumvention Tools
Jailbreaking and DMCA

Jailbreaking and DMCA
Remedies:
Statutory damages
Injunctions
Criminal penalties (if commercial)
Jailbreaking and DMCA
Technological measure?
DVD encryption
protocol encryption
authentication handshakes
“chain of trust” code signing?
code obfuscation?
undocumented protocols?
Jailbreaking and DMCA
Statutory exceptions:
Reverse engineering for interoperability
Security testing
Encryption research
Law enforcement
[also must be a nexus with infringement]
Jailbreaking and DMCA
1201(f): Reverse engineering for interoperability
A person who has lawfully obtained the right to use a cop
of a computer program may circumvent … for the sole
urpose of identifying and analyzing those elements of th
program that are necessary to achieve interoperability o
an independently created computer program with other
programs, and that have not previously been readily
available to the person engaging in the circumvention, to
the extent any such acts of identiﬁcation and analysis do
not constitute infringement...
Jailbreaking and DMCA
1201(f): Reverse engineering for interoperability
lawfully obtained
for the sole purpose of identifying and analyzing … to
chieve interoperability
for program-to-program interoperability
information not previously been readily available
not infringing (i.e., fair use)
Jailbreaking and DMCA
Application to Jailbreaking:
Jailbreaking tool developers?
iPhone owners?
DMCA Triennial Rule-Making
http://www.copyright.gov/1201
Proposed Jailbreaking Exception
Computer programs that enable wireless
elephone handsets to execute lawfully
obtained software applications, where
circumvention is accomplished for the sole
purpose of enabling interoperability of such
applications with computer programs on the
elephone handset .
Special issues raised by
networked applications
Online Gaming
many of the same issues as jailbreaking, but n
there's a network
•Blizzard v. In Game Dollar
•Bragg v. Linden Labs
•Other examples
Applied to online games

Strategies & Lessons
Avoid clicking through EULAs
Think before copying
Copy no more than necessary
(clean room)
