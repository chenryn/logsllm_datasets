**ATT&CK ID:** M1040  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Behavior Prevention on Endpoint

**Description:**
On Windows 10, enable Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) rules to prevent Visual Basic and JavaScript scripts from executing potentially malicious downloaded content.

**Recommendation:**
To enhance security and mitigate the risk of script-based attacks, it is recommended to enable the following ASR rules:
- **Block executable content from email client and webmail**: This rule prevents the execution of potentially malicious scripts that are downloaded via email.
- **Block Office applications from creating executable content**: This rule restricts Office applications from generating or executing potentially harmful scripts.
- **Block all Office applications from injecting code into other processes**: This rule helps in preventing malicious scripts from running by blocking code injection.

By implementing these ASR rules, you can significantly reduce the attack surface and protect your endpoints from script-based threats.
