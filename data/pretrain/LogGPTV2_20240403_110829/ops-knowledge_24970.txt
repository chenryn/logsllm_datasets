**User:**
I am looking for a way in Python to determine the type of file system used for a given path. I need this solution to be cross-platform, as it should work on Linux, macOS, and Windows. On Linux, I could use `df -T` to get this information, but that command is not available on macOS or Windows.

**Assistant:**
To achieve this in a cross-platform manner, you can use the `psutil` library, which provides a consistent interface across different operating systems. Here’s how you can do it:

1. **Install the `psutil` library** if you haven't already:
   ```bash
   pip install psutil
   ```

2. **Use the following Python code** to determine the file system type for a given path:

   ```python
   import psutil

   def get_filesystem_type(path):
       try:
           # Get the filesystem information for the given path
           fs_info = psutil.disk_partitions()
           for partition in fs_info:
               if partition.mountpoint in path:
                   return partition.fstype
           return None
       except Exception as e:
           print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
           return None

   # Example usage
   path = '/path/to/your/directory'
   fs_type = get_filesystem_type(path)
   if fs_type:
       print(f"The file system type for {path} is: {fs_type}")
   else:
       print(f"Could not determine the file system type for {path}.")
   ```

This code will work on Linux, macOS, and Windows, providing a cross-platform solution to determine the file system type for a given path.
