graphs, it is easy to form sparsely-connected subgraphs, thus
requiring more monitors to guarantee identiﬁability. Among
the four models, we observe that RMP exhibits worse per-
formance in the model with a larger κMMP. This is because
large κMMP implies poor connectivity within certain sub-
graphs, where a considerable number of nodes have to be
selected as monitors to achieve identiﬁability. Thus, RMP
will fail to achieve identiﬁability if it does not select suﬃcient
nodes in any of these subgraphs.
We perform similar simulations for sparsely-connected gra-
phs by adjusting the parameters16, shown in Fig. 10.
In
comparison with Fig. 9, both MMP and RMP perform worse
in sparsely-connected graphs, requiring a larger number of
16To generate roughly the same number of links as in the
other models, dc for the RG graph becomes much smaller
than plog |V |/(π|V |), making the probability of generating
a connected RG graph very small. Thus, the RG model is
omitted from Fig. 10.

monitors to achieve the same probability of identiﬁability.
This is because sparser graphs impose more constraints on
candidate measurement paths between a pair of monitors,
and thus more monitors are needed to identify all links. As
we compare the performance of the same graph model in
Fig. 9 and 10, we observe that all models exhibit smooth
transitions when we vary the average number of links n ex-
cept for the BA model, which has extremely good perfor-
mance for nmin = 3 but the worst performance (except for
RG) for nmin = 2. This can again be explained by exam-
ining the 3-vertex-connectivity of the generated graph real-
izations. We have veriﬁed that as we reduce nmin from 3 to
2, the probability for BA graphs to be 3-vertex-connected
suddenly drops from 87.8% to 0%, making it unlikely for an
arbitrary placement to achieve identiﬁability. In fact, when
nmin = 2, on average 49.2% of the nodes in BA graphs have
degrees less than 3, which have to be selected as monitors
by rules (i) and (ii) in MMP. Therefore, RMP will fail to
achieve identiﬁability even if it misses one of these nodes,
resulting in its poor performance.
7.3.2 Autonomous System Topologies
We now test MMP and RMP on real network topologies.
We use the Autonomous System (AS) topologies from both
the Rocketfuel [34] and the CAIDA [35] projects, which
represent IP-level connections between backbone/gateway
routers of several ASes from major Internet Service Providers
(ISPs) around the globe. The parameters of selected net-
works obtained from these two projects are listed in Tables 2
and 3, where we sort the networks according to their num-
bers of links, and rMMP := κMMP/|V | denotes the minimum
fraction of monitors computed by MMP in a network with
|V | nodes.
1) AS topologies from Rocketfuel: As shown in Ta-
ble 2, each AS in Rocketfuel corresponds to an ISP. To iden-
tify the entire network, we observe that most ISPs need a
signiﬁcant fraction of nodes to be monitors, ranging from
around 30% (Ebone, AT&T, Sprintlink) to more than 60%
(Abovenet). This is because ISP networks contain a large
number of gateway17 routers to connect to customer net-
works or other ISPs, which appear as dangling nodes that
have to be selected as monitors (see rule (i) in Section 7.2).
We repeat RMP for 15 · |V | Monte Carlo runs for each ISP
to evaluate its average performance, measured by the frac-
tion of Monte Carlo runs achieving identiﬁability, as shown
in Fig. 11. To facilitate comparison, we mark the fraction of
monitors rMMP needed by MMP in the legends of the same
plot; note that MMP guarantees identiﬁability for each net-
work as long as κ/|V | ≥ rMMP. Here we normalize the num-
ber of monitors by the total number of nodes for the x-axis
to compare networks of various sizes. Moreover, we only
plot the results of RMP for κ/|V | ≥ 95% since RMP fails
to achieve identiﬁability in almost all the Monte Carlo runs
for all the ISPs when κ/|V | < 95%.
As in the case of synthetic graphs, we again observe a
signiﬁcant improvement of MMP over RMP. Speciﬁcally,
RMP has at most 50% probability of identifying all the links
even if 99% of the nodes are monitors, whereas MMP guar-
antees identiﬁability using at most 64% of nodes as mon-
itors. The poor performance of RMP is due to the het-
erogeneous connectivity within ISP networks, which contain
poorly-connected subnetworks that need a large fraction of
monitors, a requirement unlikely to be fulﬁlled by random
placement. We also observe that the relative performance
of MMP and RMP varies for diﬀerent networks, e.g., Level3
and Exodus experience similar performance under RMP,
whereas their minimum fractions of monitors computed by
MMP diﬀer signiﬁcantly (0.15 for Level3 and 0.42 for Exo-
dus). Intuitively, this is because RMP performance is deter-
mined by the relative number of valid placements, i.e., the
fraction of all the (cid:0)|V |
identiﬁability, whereas MMP performance is determined by
the smallest κ for which this fraction is non-zero.
κ (cid:1) candidate placements that achieve
2) AS topologies from CAIDA: Because ISP topolo-
gies have evolved since the Rocketfuel project, we repeat
the above evaluation on a recent data set obtained by the
CAIDA project; see results in Table 3 and Fig. 12. Com-
pared with the ASes in Rocketfuel data set, we notice that
ASes with similar average node degrees (i.e., 2|L|/|V |) in
CAIDA data set require a larger fraction of monitors for
complete identiﬁcation, e.g., rMMP = 0.71 for AS8717 with
average node degree 4.2 in Table 3, whereas rMMP = 0.32 for
AS1755 (Ebone) with average node degree 4.4 in Table 2.
This is because ASes in CAIDA data set tend to be more
skewed in connectivity, with more densely-connected cores
and a larger number of dangling nodes (likely the gateways
for peer/customer connections). As all dangling nodes have
to be selected as monitors, such skewed connectivity leads to
a higher ratio of monitors although the average node degree
is not necessarily lower. Meanwhile, comparison with RMP
(3000 Monte Carlo runs), presented in Fig. 12, shows that
the improvement of MMP over RMP remains signiﬁcant. As
in Fig. 11, RMP again exhibits poor performance for all the
ASes considered in Fig. 12, which has less than 35% proba-
bility of identifying all links even if the fraction of monitors
κ/|V | is as large as 0.99. In particular, for almost all the
17In real networks, monitor selection may be constrained to
a subset of nodes, e.g., gateways. Under such constraint, the
issue of achievable number of identiﬁable links (i.e., partial
network identiﬁability) is left for future work.
networks (except for AS20965) in Fig. 12, RMP fails to iden-
tify all the links in more than 60% of the Monte Carlo runs
even if all but one node are monitors. In contrast, carefully
selected monitors by MMP can guarantee complete identiﬁ-
cation while substantially reducing the required number of
monitors.
8. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we study the fundamental conditions on
network topology and placement of monitors for identifying
additive link metrics using end-to-end measurements along
simple paths between monitors. We show that with two
monitors, it is impossible to identify all the link metrics,
but is possible to identify the metrics of interior links that
are at least one hop away from the monitors, for which we
derive the necessary and suﬃcient conditions in terms of
edge/vertex connectivity of the network topology. We fur-
ther study the case of three or more monitors and derive the
corresponding necessary and suﬃcient conditions for iden-
tifying all the link metrics. We show that these conditions
are not only useful for testing network identiﬁability under a
given monitor placement, but also enable an eﬃcient moni-
tor placement algorithm that guarantees identiﬁability using
the minimum number of monitors. Our evaluations on both
random and real network topologies verify that the proposed
algorithm signiﬁcantly outperforms a baseline solution.
