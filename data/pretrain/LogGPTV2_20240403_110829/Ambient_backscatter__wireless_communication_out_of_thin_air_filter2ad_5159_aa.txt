ABSTRACT
We present the design of a communication system that enables
two devices to communicate using ambient RF as the only source
of power. Our approach leverages existing TV and cellular trans-
missions to eliminate the need for wires and batteries, thus enabling
ubiquitous communication where devices can communicate among
themselves at unprecedented scales and in locations that were pre-
viously inaccessible.
To achieve this, we introduce ambient backscatter, a new com-
munication primitive where devices communicate by backscatter-
ing ambient RF signals. Our design avoids the expensive process
of generating radio waves; backscatter communication is orders of
magnitude more power-efﬁcient than traditional radio communica-
tion. Further, since it leverages the ambient RF signals that are al-
ready around us, it does not require a dedicated power infrastruc-
ture as in traditional backscatter communication. To show the fea-
sibility of our design, we prototype ambient backscatter devices in
hardware and achieve information rates of 1 kbps over distances
of 2.5 feet and 1.5 feet, while operating outdoors and indoors re-
spectively. We use our hardware prototype to implement proof-of-
concepts for two previously infeasible ubiquitous communication
applications.

INTRODUCTION
Small computing devices are increasingly embedded in objects
and environments such as thermostats, books, furniture, and even
implantable medical devices [15, 22, 19]. A key issue is how to
power these devices as they become smaller and numerous; wires
are often not feasible, and batteries add weight, bulk, cost, and re-
quire recharging or replacement that adds maintenance cost and is
difﬁcult at large scales [36].
In this paper, we ask the following question: can we enable de-
vices to communicate using ambient RF signals as the only source
of power? Ambient RF from TV and cellular communications is

vices. To legacy receivers, this signal is simply an additional source
of multi-path, and they can still decode the original transmission.
widely available in urban areas (day and night, indoors and out-
doors). Further, recent work has shown that one can harvest tens to
hundreds of microwatts from these signals [32, 24]. Thus, a positive
answer would enable ubiquitous communication at unprecedented
scales and in locations that were previously inaccessible.
Designing such systems, however, is challenging as the simple
act of generating a conventional radio wave typically requires much
more power than can be harvested from ambient RF signals [24]. In
this paper, we introduce ambient backscatter, a novel communica-
tion mechanism that enables devices to communicate by backscat-
tering ambient RF. In traditional backscatter communication (e.g.,
RFID), a device communicates by modulating its reﬂections of an
incident RF signal (and not by generating radio waves). Hence, it is
orders of magnitude more energy-efﬁcient than conventional radio
communication [11].
Ambient backscatter differs from RFID-style backscatter in three
key respects. Firstly, it takes advantage of existing RF signals so
it does not require the deployment of a special-purpose power
infrastructure—like an RFID reader—to transmit a high-power
(1W) signal to nearby devices. This avoids installation and main-
tenance costs that may make such a system impractical, especially
if the environment is outdoors or spans a large area. Second, and
related, it has a very small environmental footprint because no ad-
ditional energy is consumed beyond that which is already in the air.
Finally, ambient backscatter provides device-to-device communi-
cation. This is unlike traditional RFID systems in which tags must
talk exclusively to an RFID reader and are unable to even sense the
transmissions of other nearby tags.
To understand ambient backscatter in more detail, consider two
nearby battery-free devices, Alice and Bob, and a TV tower in a
metropolitan area as the ambient source, as shown in Fig. 1. Sup-
pose Alice wants to send a packet to Bob. To do so, Alice backscat-
ters the ambient signals to convey the bits in the packet—she can
indicate either a ‘0’ or a ‘1’ bit by switching her antenna between
39We experiment with two proof-of-concept applications that show
the potential of ambient backscatter in achieving ubiquitous com-
munication. The ﬁrst application is a bus pass that can also transfer
money to other cards anywhere, at any time. When a user swipes
the touch sensor in the presence of another card, it transmits the cur-
rent balance stored in the microcontroller and conﬁrms the transac-
tion by ﬂashing the LED. The second is a grocery store application
where an item tag can tell when an item is placed in a wrong shelf.
We ask 10 tags to verify that they do not contain a misplaced tag
and ﬂash the LED when they do.
We evaluate our system in both indoor and outdoor scenarios
and at varying distances between the transmitter and receiver. To
account for multi-path effects, we repeat our measurements with
slight perturbations of the receiver position for a total of 1020 mea-
surements. Results show that our prototypes can achieve an infor-
mation rate of 1 kbps between two ambient backscattering devices,
at distances of up to 2.5 feet in outdoor locations and 1.5 feet in
indoor locations. Furthermore, we test a variety of locations and
show that our end-to-end system (which includes communication,
an LED, touch sensors and a general-purpose microcontroller) is
able to operate battery-free at distances of up to 6.5 miles from the
TV tower. Finally, we test the interference of ambient backscatter-
ing and ﬁnd that, even in less favorable conditions, it does not create
any noticeable glitches on an off-the-shelf TV, as long as the device
is more than 7.2 inches away from the TV antenna.2
Our Contributions: We make the following contributions:
• We introduce ambient backscatter, the ﬁrst wireless primitive to
let devices communicate without either requiring them to gen-
erate RF signals (as in conventional communications) or reﬂect
signals from a dedicated powered reader (as in RFID).
• We develop a network stack that enables multiple ambient
backscattering devices to co-exist. Speciﬁcally, we show how to
perform energy detection without the ability to directly measure
the energy on the medium and hence enable carrier sense.
• We present designs and a prototype which show how all of the
above, from ambient backscatter through to the multi-access pro-
tocols of our network, can be implemented on ultra-low-power
devices using simple analog components.
While the performance of our prototype is a modest start, we
hope that the techniques we present will help realize ubiquitous
communication, and allow computing devices embedded into the
physical world to communicate amongst themselves at an unprece-
dented scale.
2. BACKGROUND ON TV TRANSMISSIONS
In principle, ambient backscatter is a general technique that can
leverage RF signals including TV, radio and cellular transmissions.
In this paper we have chosen to focus on demonstrating the feasi-
bility of ambient backscatter of signals from TV broadcast sources.
TV towers transmit up to 1 MW effective radiated power (ERP)
and can serve locations more than 100 mi away from the tower in
very ﬂat terrain and up to 45 mi in denser terrain [1]. The cover-
age of these signals is excellent, particularly in urban areas with the
top four broadcast TV channels in America reaching 97% of house-
holds and the average American household receiving 17 broadcast
TV stations [4]. It is this pervasive nature of TV signals that make
them attractive for use in our ﬁrst ambient backscatter prototype.
There are currently three main TV standards that are used around
the world: ATSC (N. America and S. Korea), DVB-T (Europe, Aus-
tralia, New Zealand, etc.) and ISDB-T (Japan, most of S. Amer-
ica) [5]. While our prototype targets ATSC transmissions, our

vest, transmit and receive without needing a battery or powered
reader. It also includes touch sensors (the A, B and C buttons), and

ergy and can be programmed by an onboard microcontroller.
reﬂecting and non-reﬂecting states. The signals that are reﬂected
by Alice effectively create an additional path from the TV tower to
Bob and other nearby receivers. Wideband receivers for TV and cel-
lular applications are designed to compensate for multi-path wire-
less channels, and can potentially account for the additional path.
Bob, on the other hand, can sense the signal changes caused by the
backscattering, and decode Alice’s packet.
Designing an ambient backscatter system is challenging for at
least three reasons.
• Since backscattered signals are weak, traditional backscatter uses
a constant signal [21] to facilitate the detection of small level
changes. Ambient backscatter uses uncontrollable RF signals
that already have information encoded in them. Hence it requires
a different mechanism to extract the backscattered information.
• Traditional backscatter receivers rely on power-hungry compo-
nents such as oscillators and ADCs and decode the signal with
relatively complex digital signal processing techniques. These
techniques are not practical for use in a battery-free receiver.
• Ambient backscatter lacks a centralized controller such as an
RFID reader to coordinate all communications. Thus, it must
operate a distributed multiple access protocol and develop func-
tionalities like carrier sense that are not available in traditional
backscattering devices.
Our approach is to co-design the hardware elements for ambient
backscatter along with the layers in the network stack that make use
of it. The key insight we use to decode transmissions is that there
is a large difference in the information transfer rates of the ambient
RF signal and backscattered signal. This difference allows for the
separation of these signals using only low-power analog operations
that correspond to readily available components like capacitors and
comparators. We are similarly able to realize carrier sense and fram-
ing operations with low-power components based on the physical
properties of ambient backscatter signals. This in turn lets us syn-
thesize network protocols for coordinating multiple such devices.
To show the feasibility of our ideas, we have built a hardware
prototype, shown in Fig. 2, that is approximately the size of a credit
card.1 Our prototype includes a power harvester for TV signals, as
well as the ambient backscatter hardware that is tuned to commu-
nicate by using UHF TV signals in a 50 MHz wide frequency band
centered at 539 MHz. The harvested energy is used to provide the
small amounts of power required for ambient backscatter and to run
the microcontroller and the on-board sensors. Our prototype also
includes a low-power ﬂashing LED and capacitive touch sensor for
use by applications.
1We use off-the-shelf components to design and build our proto-
type. A production integrated circuit would achieve better results
and be of an arbitrary form factor (down to 1 mm2 plus the antenna).
40method for communicating using ambient signals leverages the fol-
lowing properties of TV signals that hold across all standards:
Firstly, TV towers broadcast uninterrupted, continuous signals at
all hours of the day and night. Thus, they provide a reliable source
of both power and signal for use in ambient backscatter. Secondly,
TV transmissions are amplitude-varying signals that change at a
fast rate. For example, in ATSC, which uses an 8-level vestigial
sideband (8VSB) modulation to transmit one of eight amplitude
values per symbol, symbols are sent over a 6 MHz wideband chan-
nel, resulting in a very fast ﬂuctuation in the signal.
Lastly, TV transmissions periodically encode special synchro-
nization symbols that are used by the receiver to compute the mul-
tipath channel characteristics [9]. In ATSC, the 8VSB symbols are
organized ﬁrst into data segments of 832 symbols and then ﬁelds of
313 segments. Before every data segment, the transmitter sends a
data segment sync that consists of four symbols and is intended to
help the receiver calibrate the 8VSB amplitude levels. Before every
ﬁeld, the transmitter sends a ﬁeld sync data segment that is also used
by the receiver to compute the channel information. Since ambient
backscatter effectively creates additional paths from the transmit-
ter to the TV receiver, the existing ability of TV receivers to ac-
count for multipath distortion make them resistant to interference
from backscattering devices that operate at a lower rate than these
sync segments. We note that the other common TV standard in the
world—DVB-T, which uses OFDM modulation—includes cyclic
preﬁxes and guard intervals, and hence has an even higher resis-
tance to multipath distortion compared to the ATSC standard [2].
Legality: In general, it is illegal to broadcast random signals on
spectrum reserved for TV (or cellular) channels. However, battery-
free backscattering devices (e.g. RFID tags) are unregulated and
not tested by FCC because the emission levels from such devices is
very low [7] and because they are only modulating their reﬂection
of a pre-existing signal rather than actively emitting a signal in re-
served spectrum. Ambient backscatter also falls into this category,
and would therefore be legal under current policies.
In the rest of this paper, we show how ultra-low-power devices
can communicate by backscattering these ambient signals.
3. AMBIENT BACKSCATTER DESIGN
Ambient backscatter is a new form of communication in which
devices can communicate without any additional power infrastruc-
ture (e.g., a nearby dedicated reader). An ambient backscattering
device reﬂects existing RF signals such as broadcast TV or cellular
transmissions to communicate. Since the ambient signals are pre-
existing, the added cost of such communication is negligible.
Designing such devices, however, is challenging for three main
reasons: First, the ambient signals are random and uncontrollable.
Thus, we need a mechanism to extract the backscattered informa-
tion from these random ambient signals. Second, the receiver has
to decode these signals on a battery-free device which signiﬁcantly
limits the design space by placing a severe constraint on the power
requirements of the device. Third, since there is no centralized con-
troller to coordinate communications, these devices need to operate
a distributed multiple access protocol and develop functionalities
like carrier sense. In the rest of this section, we describe how our
design addresses the above challenges.
3.1 Overview
Fig. 3 shows a block diagram of our ambient backscattering
device design. It consists of a transmitter, a receiver and a har-
vester that all use the same ambient RF signals and thus are all
connected to the same antenna. The transmitter and receiver use
modulated backscattering of ambient signals to communicate, and
Figure 3—Block diagram of an ambient backscattering device.
The transmitter, receiver, and the harvester are all connected to a
single antenna and use the same RF signals. The transmitter and
receiver communicate by backscattering the ambient signals. The
harvester collects energy from the ambient signals and uses it to
provide the small amount of power required for communication and
to operate the sensors and the digital logic unit.
the harvester extracts energy from those same ambient signals
to provide power for the device. Further, they operate indepen-
dent of each other. However, while the transmitter is active and
backscattering signals, the receiver and harvester cannot capture
much signal/power. The harvested energy is used to provide the
small amounts of power required for ambient backscatter commu-
nication and to power the sensors and the digital logic units (e.g.,
microcontroller). We reproduce the harvester circuit in [32] and use
it as a black box. The main difference from [32] is that we operate
the harvester using a small dipole antenna, instead of a large horn
antenna. Next, we describe our design of the ambient backscatter-
ing transmitter and receiver in more detail.
3.2 Ambient Backscattering Transmitter
The design of our ambient backscattering transmitter builds
on conventional backscatter communication techniques. At a high
level, backscattering is achieved by changing the impedance of an
antenna in the presence of an incident signal. Intuitively, when a
wave encounters a boundary between two media that have dif-
ferent impedances/densities, the wave is reﬂected back [18]. The
amount of reﬂection is typically determined by the difference in
the impedance/density values. This holds whether the wave is a
mechanical wave that travels through a rope ﬁxed to a point on a
wall or an electromagnetic wave encountering an antenna. By mod-
ulating the electrical impedance at the port of the antenna one can
modulate the amount of incident RF energy that is scattered, hence
enabling information to be transmitted.
To achieve this, the backscatter transmitter includes a switch that
modulates the impedance of the antenna and causes a change in the
amount of energy reﬂected by the antenna. The switch consists of a
transistor connected across the two branches of the dipole antenna.
The input signal of the switch is a sequence of one and zero bits.
When the input is zero, the transistor is off and the impedences are
matched, with very little of the signal reﬂected. When the switch in-
put signal is one, the transistor is in a conducting stage which shorts
the two branches of the antenna and results in a larger scattered
signal amplitude. Thus, the switch toggles between the backscatter
(reﬂective) and non-backscatter (absorptive) states to convey bits to
the receiver.
We note the following about our design: Firstly, the communica-
tion efﬁciency is high when the antenna topology is optimized for
the frequency of the ambient signals. Our implementation uses a
258 millimeter dipole antenna, optimized for a 50 MHz subset (in
this case, from 515-565 MHz) of the UHF TV band. Other antenna
topologies such as meandered antennas [29] and folded dipoles [27]
41can result in smaller dimensions, and further design choices can be
made to increase the bandwidth of the antenna in order to make it
capable of utilizing a larger frequency band. However, exploring
this design space is not within the scope of this paper.
Secondly, RF switches can have a large difference between their
conducting and non-conducting impedance values, but only in the
speciﬁc frequency range that they are designed for. For example,
using a switch that is optimized for use in RFID tags that operate in
915 MHz would not be optimal for ambient backscatter of lower-
frequency TV signals. Thus, the ambient backscattering transmitter
should select a switch that is optimal for the operational frequencies
of the ambient signals.
Finally, the switches and antennas are not designed to speciﬁcally
backscatter and receive on a particular TV channel. For example,
in ATSC, each TV channel has a 6 MHz bandwidth and different
TV channels are typically allocated to adjacent non-overlapping
frequencies. Since ambient backscattering devices backscatter all
these signals, they do not require ﬁne tuning for each frequency
and can work as long as there are TV transmissions on at least one
of the frequencies.
3.3 Ambient Backscattering Receiver
Designing an ambient backscatter receiver is challenging for two
main reasons: First, ambient signals already encode information
and hence backscattering additional information over these sig-
nals can be difﬁcult. Second, the backscattered information should
be decodable on an ultra-low-power device without using power-
hungry hardware components such as ADCs and oscillators. To
address these challenges, we ﬁrst show how one can extract the
