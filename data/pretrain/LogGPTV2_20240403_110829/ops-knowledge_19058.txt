### Situation

We have an application deployed on App Engine with full-text search functionality enabled. Initially, we had an index set up for a document that included a field named 'date', which was of type `DateField`. Recently, we modified the document model, changing the 'date' field to a `NumericField`.

The issue is that, even after clearing all documents from the index on the production server, we encounter the following error:

```
Failed to parse search request ""; SortSpec numeric default value does not match expression type 'TEXT' in 'date'
```

### Analysis

The problem, I believe, stems from a mismatch between the current model on the server and the expected model for the search query. The existing index still retains the old schema, where 'date' is treated as a `DateField`, while the new model expects it to be a `NumericField`.

### Solution

To resolve this, you need to delete the entire index, including its schema, so that the new documents can be indexed correctly. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

1. **Delete All Documents from the Index:**
   Ensure that all documents are removed from the index. This can be done programmatically or through the Google Cloud Console.

2. **Delete the Index Schema:**
   Call the `index.delete_schema()` method (or `index.deleteSchema()` in Java) to remove the existing mappings from field names to their types. This will allow you to re-index your documents with the new schema.

Here is an example in Python:

```python
from google.appengine.api import search

# Get the index
index = search.Index(name='your_index_name')

# Delete all documents from the index
while True:
    document_ids = [document.doc_id for document in index.get_range(ids_only=True)]
    if not document_ids:
        break
    index.delete(document_ids)

# Delete the schema
index.delete_schema()
```

In Java, you would do something similar:

```java
import com.google.appengine.api.search.*;

// Get the index
IndexSpec indexSpec = IndexSpec.newBuilder().setName("your_index_name").build();
Index index = SearchServiceFactory.getSearchService().getIndex(indexSpec);

// Delete all documents from the index
Document doc;
while ((doc = index.getDocument(doc.getId())) != null) {
    index.delete(doc.getId());
}

// Delete the schema
index.deleteSchema();
```

After performing these steps, you can re-index your documents with the updated model, and the search should work as expected.

### Additional Notes

- **Backup Data:** Before deleting the index and its schema, ensure you have a backup of any important data.
- **Testing:** Verify the changes on a development environment before applying them to the production server to avoid any unexpected issues.

If you follow these steps, the production server should no longer throw the "SortSpec numeric default value does not match expression type 'TEXT' in 'date'" error, and your full-text search should function correctly with the new `NumericField` type.
