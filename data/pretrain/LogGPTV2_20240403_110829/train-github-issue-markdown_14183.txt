### Which version of ShardingSphere did you use?
5.0.0-RC1-SNAPSHOT

### Which project did you use? ShardingSphere-JDBC or ShardingSphere-Proxy?
ShardingSphere-JDBC

### Reason Analysis
I believe the issue may be located in the following part of the code:
- **File**: `org.apache.shardingsphere.infra.metadata.schema.builder.SchemaBuilder`
- **Method**: `appendRemainTables`
- **Line Number**: 70

**Reference:**
- [GitHub Comment #8605](#8605)

**Details:**
When the system starts, ShardingSphere should load the metadata for all remaining tables. However, it appears that this is not happening as expected. The relevant section of the code is shown below:

To ensure proper functionality, the metadata for all remaining tables must be loaded during system initialization.
