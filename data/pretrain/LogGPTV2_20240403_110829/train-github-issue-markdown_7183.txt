# Context and Rationale
At the moment, `flutter create --template=plugin` (ref) defaults to Objective
C and Java. It is my suggestion that the we switch the default to Swift and
Kotlin respectively instead.
Kotlin is first-class language supported by Android, and officially preferred
by Android rather than Java (ref) even if Kotlin adds a little bit overhead
(ref)
When it comes to Swift, the case is even stronger. While Kotlin is officially
endorsed and preferred by Android team, it's still developed by another
entity, JetBrain. Meanwhile, Swift is developed by Apple specifically for iOS,
macOS and tvOS development. In the first quarter of 2018 Swift surpassed
Objective-C in measured popularity (ref). The runtime overhead will no longer
be an issue for Swift 5, according to wwdc 2018
> And we also have another release coming up for you in the language, Swift 5.
> The focus of Swift 5 is greater adoption by delivering Swift as part of the
> OS. Apps will no longer need to include the Swift runtime when delivering on
> our newer OS releases, resulting in smaller downloads and faster launches.
> We're very excited about this, too, and we have made great progress toward
> this goal. And you'll see it in a release coming early next year.
