User: I've got a script that accepts a path as an external argument and I would like to attach it to Total Commander.
So I need a script/plugin for TC that would pass a path of opened directory as an argument and run a Python script which is located for example at C:/Temp
How can I achieve this?
Best Regards,
Marek
Assistant: You can add a new button to the button bar.

Right-click on an existing Icon and copy the icon by choosing "copy" from drop-down menu.
Paste it into the button bar by right-clicking on it, choosing "paste" from the menu.
Right-click on this copied icon and choose "modify" (or similar). This opens a window that allows you the choose a program and a parameter.

Note: My version is set to a different language so the names of the menu items might be a bit different.
