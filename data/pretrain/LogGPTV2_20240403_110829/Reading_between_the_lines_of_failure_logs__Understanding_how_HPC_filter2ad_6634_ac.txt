# Analysis of Node Failure Rates and Usage Impact in High-Performance Computing Systems

## Introduction
This document provides an in-depth analysis of the failure rates of nodes in high-performance computing (HPC) systems, with a focus on the impact of usage and user behavior. The analysis is based on data from multiple HPC systems, including System 18, System 19, and System 20.

## Failure Types and Probabilities

### Figure 6: Failure Type Probabilities
**Figure 6** illustrates the probability of different failure types in failure-prone nodes compared to the rest of the nodes in the system.

- **Observation 1**: Node 0 exhibits increased failure probabilities for all types of failures, indicating that the higher failure rate cannot be attributed to a specific type.
- **Observation 2**: The increase in failure probabilities is particularly high for environmental and network failures, with factors of increase in the 2000x and 500x-1000x range, respectively.
- **Observation 3**: Software failure rates are significantly higher in node 0 than in the remainder of the system, with factors ranging from 36X to 118X.
- **Observation 4**: The increase in the probability of hardware failures is modest but still significant, with factors in the 5–10X range.

To formalize these results, a chi-square test was performed for each failure type. The null hypothesis that nodes fail with equal rates was rejected for all failure types except for those due to human errors, which were not statistically significant at the 99% confidence level.

### Figure 5: Failure Root Cause Breakdown
**Figure 5** shows the relative breakdown of failures by root cause for failure-prone nodes compared to the whole system. The analysis reveals a higher percentage of software, environmental, and network failures in failure-prone nodes, consistent with the findings in **Figure 6**. Notably, the dominant failure mode shifts from hardware failures to software failures in the failure-prone nodes.

## Factors Contributing to Node Failures

### Hypotheses and Analysis
1. **Statistical Effects and Correlated Failures**:
   - Once a node starts to develop failures, a large number of correlated follow-up failures can significantly increase its total failure rate.

2. **Node Position in the Machine Room or Rack**:
   - No clear patterns were found indicating that certain areas in the machine room or rack positions were more likely to be correlated with higher error rates.

3. **Usage Impact**:
   - The effect of usage on node reliability was studied using job logs from two representative systems, System 8 and System 20.
   - Two usage metrics were considered: average node utilization and the number of jobs assigned to a node throughout its lifetime.

### Figure 7: Impact of Usage on Node Reliability
**Figure 7** plots the number of failures against the node’s average utilization and the number of jobs served by the node.

- **Observation 1**: In both systems, failure-prone node 0 tends to have the highest utilization and the largest number of jobs assigned to it.
- **Observation 2**: Pearson correlation coefficients between the number of jobs and failures were positive (0.465 and 0.12), but removing node 0 reduced the correlation to insignificant levels.
- **Conclusion**: The strong linear correlation between usage and failures is primarily due to node 0, which often serves as a login node or job scheduler.

## User-Specific Failure Rates

### Figure 8: Distribution of Failed Jobs Over Different Users
**Figure 8** shows the distribution of failed jobs over different users, focusing on the 50 heaviest users in terms of processor-days used.

- **Observation 1**: There is a large discrepancy in failure rates experienced by different users.
- **Observation 2**: Poisson regression and ANOVA tests confirmed that the difference in failure rates between users is statistically significant.

### Conclusion
The way a node is exercised affects its failure rates. Some users may run applications that are more likely to trigger bugs in system software or exercise hardware components in ways that make intermittent or hard errors more likely.
