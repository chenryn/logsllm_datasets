User: What are the common attack methods in IT operation and maintenance? Please list and describe the corresponding defense solutions.
Assistant: 1. DDos attack: It refers to malicious attackers using specific tools to send a large number of invalid requests to the target server or network, thereby occupying a large amount of network bandwidth and system resources. Defense method: Use a traffic cleaner to filter out DDos attack traffic, and install security devices such as an intrusion detection system and an intrusion prevention system. 2. SQL injection attack: It is to attack the database system by constructing malicious SQL statements, so as to obtain or tamper with data. Defense method: Developers should strengthen code security, filter and verify all input data, and use parameterized query statements to avoid SQL injection attacks. 3. Malware attack: refers to the use of viruses, Trojan horses, worms and other malicious software to attack the system or application programs, so as to achieve malicious purposes such as stealing data and destroying the system. Defense method: Use anti-virus software, firewall, intrusion detection system and other security equipment to regularly scan and maintain the system. 4. Spam attack: refers to the use of e-mail to send a large number of spam, thereby occupying network bandwidth and consuming system resources. Defense method: Use anti-spam software to block spam, restrict mail servers, set mail filtering rules, etc. to reduce spam. 5. Password guessing attack: It refers to cracking passwords by trying different password combinations multiple times to obtain sensitive information. Defense method: Users should set complex passwords and change them regularly. System administrators should strengthen password policies and security policies, and use two-factor authentication to enhance password security. 6. Port scanning attack: refers to the use of port scanning tools to scan the network system to find loopholes and attack entrances. Defense method: Use security devices such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems to monitor and manage ports, and detect and deal with port scanning attacks in a timely manner. 7. Social engineering attack: refers to the use of social engineering techniques to deceive users to obtain access rights or sensitive information. Defense method: users should raise security awareness and be alert to fraudulent methods, and system administrators should strengthen employee security awareness education and security policy management.
