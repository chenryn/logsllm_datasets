I am encountering the following error: "Error: Plug-in failed to initialize // Testing Challenge."

```javascript
var Car = function(wheels, seats, engines) {
  // Modify this constructor
  this.wheels = wheels;
  this.seats = seats;
  this.engines = engines;
};

// Test the constructor here
var myCar = new Car(3, 2, 1);

// Only modify the code above this line
(function() { 
  return JSON.stringify(myCar); 
})();
```

### Explanation:
- **Error Message:** The error message is now clearly stated.
- **Code Block:** The JavaScript code is properly formatted with comments for clarity.
- **Constructor Parameters:** The `Car` constructor now correctly accepts parameters for `wheels`, `seats`, and `engines`.
- **Test Instance:** The test instance `myCar` is created with the specified values.
- **JSON Stringify:** The IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) at the end returns the JSON string representation of `myCar`.

This should help you understand and resolve the issue more effectively.
