**User:**

I am trying to install a Python package on my Windows system. I attempted to run `setup.py install` from the command prompt, but encountered the following error:
```
could not create 'C:\Program Files\Python...': access is denied.
```
Could you please help me resolve this issue?

Best regards,
Špela

**Assistant:**

Thank you for reaching out, Špela.

The error message you received suggests that you may not have the necessary administrative rights to write to the specified directory. My first question would be, are you running the command prompt as an administrator? If not, please try the following steps:

1. **Run Command Prompt as Administrator:**
   - Right-click on the Command Prompt icon.
   - Select "Run as administrator."
   - Try running the `setup.py install` command again.

If you are already running the command prompt as an administrator and still encounter the issue, there might be other permissions or environment settings to consider. Let me know if this resolves the problem or if you need further assistance.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
