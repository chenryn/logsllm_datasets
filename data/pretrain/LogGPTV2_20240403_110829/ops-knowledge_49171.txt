I recently installed Python 3.5 on my Windows PC, and the installation directory is:
```
C:\Users\PCNAME\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python35-32
```

I then ran `python get-pip.py` in the Command Prompt (CMD), and it indicated that `pip` was installed successfully. However, when I type `pip` in the CMD, it says that the command is not recognized.

Could you please help me understand what might be going wrong?

**Solution:**

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to the Scripts Directory:**
   Open File Explorer and navigate to the `Scripts` folder within your Python installation directory. The path should look like this:
   ```
   C:\Users\PCNAME\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python35-32\Scripts
   ```

2. **Open Command Prompt in the Scripts Directory:**
   - In the `Scripts` folder, press `Shift` and right-click anywhere in the folder.
   - Select "Open command window here" or "Open PowerShell window here" from the context menu.

3. **Run `pip` Commands:**
   - In the opened Command Prompt, you can now run `pip` commands. For example, to install a package, use:
     ```
     pip install {package_name}
     ```

By following these steps, you should be able to use `pip` without encountering the "command not recognized" error.
