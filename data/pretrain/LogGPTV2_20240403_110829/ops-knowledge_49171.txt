User: I have a fresh install of python 3.5 on my windows PC
and here is my directory of my installation:
C:\Users*PCNAME*\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python35-32
I have installed it entering python get-pip.py in CMD, it says it is installed successfully but when I enter pip in CMD it says it is not recognized?
Please kindly enlighten me
