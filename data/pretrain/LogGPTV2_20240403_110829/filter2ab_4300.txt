In this revised version, I've made the following improvements:
- Added a colon after "ATT&CK ID" and "Technique Name" for better formatting.
- Capitalized "Content Delivery Network" as it is a proper term.
- Changed "has used" to "has been observed using" to provide a more formal and precise description.
- Ensured the sentence is clear and professional.
