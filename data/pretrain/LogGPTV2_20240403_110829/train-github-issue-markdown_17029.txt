# Description of the new feature/enhancement
Currently it is not possible to set `colorScheme` or `padding` on a global
level, only per profile.
# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)
Every setting that can be per-profile, minus the obvious ones like name and
guid etc, should be able to be set on a global level as well.
