Introduction
In today’s tough economic times, budget decisions for public managers and elected officials 
are extremely difficult whether it’s on the state, county or local level. In municipal government, 
financial decisions can be based on varying factors that may include sales and property tax 
revenues, fees, maintenance and capital needs, debt service, and/or services demanded by the 
public. Typically, priority for funding is placed on certain services considered to be “essential” such 
as public safety, utilities, infrastructure, and general administration. Rarely is a desire expressed by 
politicians or their constituents to reduce funding in those areas. However, services considered 
“non-essential,” sometimes referred to as “quality of life” offerings such as libraries, parks, special 
events, and social services, often have a more difficult time coming out on top when it comes to 
slicing the budgetary pie. Being perceived as “non-essential” can lead to those programs 
experiencing the deepest cuts when budgets are tightened, and funding for parks is often at the top 
of the list when the hatchet falls. 
When Kermit the Frog sang “Bein’ Green” on the Sesame Street show, he expressed a feeling 
of being undervalued and overlooked because he was the color green. (Raposo, 1970)
“It's not easy being green
It seems you blend in with so many other ordinary things
And people tend to pass you over
'Cause you're not standing out
Like flashy sparkles in the water
Or stars in the sky”
Similarly, although most people relate parks to being green, their existence tends to lack 
political clout. They have to be shown to solve community problems before elected officials see 
them as being worthy of funding. In comparison, services like public safety are usually perceived as 
the “flashy sparkles in the water”, or “stars in the sky” in the problems they address. 
During budget preparations for the 2011-12 fiscal year, Dallas city manager Mary Suhm 
asked most of her departments to slash 20% from their operating budgets, while police and fire 
were only asked to make 10% reductions (Thompson, Steve, 2011). So why do parks and recreation 
services so often end up being the ‘frogs’ of public funding, especially when research indicates they 
can actually pay for themselves? Studies also show they have a strong influence on where people 
and businesses choose to locate, and they are an important weapon against the rising cost of health

care. Why don’t decision-makers see the positive impact they have on local economies? Like Kermit 
the Frog, their true value is much deeper than what may be perceived on the surface. 
It is the purpose of this paper to answer these questions and show that parks are not just 
attractive open spaces, but play a significant role as an economic engine for communities. Extensive 
research contained herein will show that parks truly increase property values, encourage business 
and workforce relocation or retention, generate tourism dollars and promote public health.  As 
such, they should be given a much greater priority for capital and operational investment by local 
governments than is currently the case. 
As with many words in the English language, the word “green” can be used in a variety of 
ways. It may conjure up a visual image such as the color of grass, a leaf, or of course, a frog. Or, it 
may indicate a type of development that is environmentally friendly or sustainable, such as a “green 
building” or “green energy.” The word “green” can also be an indicator of something of financial 
value such as a dollar bill, sometimes referred to as a “green back.” If one were asked to describe a 
park, it would likely contain the word “green” in the descriptor. But to which of these meanings 
would it refer? Most might think of the color green when describing a park. Some may consider the 
environmental or “green” effects parks offer. Rarely, do people understand or recognize that parks 
provide significant financial benefits that are “green” like the color of money. The lines are often 
blurred between the various meanings, but this research will provide a fresh and in depth look at 
how “green” parks are when it comes to their economic impact on communities.   
The first public park developed in America was Central Park in New York City. Its 700 acres, 
located in the center of Manhattan, were acquired in 1853 by the city of New York through eminent 
domain proceedings. In 1857, the Central Park Commission held a design contest for the park’s 
development. Frederick Law Olmstead, who was the park’s superintendent at that time, won the 
contest with his “Greensward Plan,” which was modeled after public spaces that existed in urban 
areas of European countries during that era.  Advocates of creating the park were primarily wealthy 
merchants and nearby landowners who wanted an attractive space for carriage rides, as well as a 
place for people to gather as a healthy alternative to hanging out in saloons (Blackmar & 
Rozenzweig). The park, acquired and developed because of the desire and influence of the

wealthiest people in New York City, eventually became a popular gathering and activity place for 
people with varying socio-economic backgrounds, as well as a destination for those visiting the city. 
With Central Park as the model, cities popping up across America over the next century 
began a common practice of creating parks and setting aside open space for community based 
activities. In more recent years, the people’s demand and expectation for parks and green space in 
their neighborhoods, along with limited public funding, has led many cities to mandate that new 
residential developers must donate land and/or funding for parks. Some developers voluntarily 
include trails, parks and playgrounds in their development because they recognize the importance 
those amenities play in selling their product in a very competitive market. The costs for these 
amenities are eventually passed on to the homebuyer, but the initial investment potentially 
provides a quick return to the developer through higher property values and more rapid home 
sales. To substantiate this, take a look at real estate classified ads in newspapers or home listings 
on realtor’s websites. Many of the listings will tout their proximity to parks, greenbelts, trails, lakes, 
golf courses, and other recreational amenities as a featured selling point. (Figure 1) Interestingly, 
these same ads never suggest that police or fire services, or well maintained roads, or good quality 
drinking water were reasons for someone to consider buying a particular home. Perhaps this is due 
to an assumption on the consumer’s part that those services are essentially equal from one city to 
the next, while parks and recreation amenities can truly make a neighborhood or community stand 
out in comparison to another. 
Clearly, people have many choices when it comes to selecting where they want to live. 
Proximity to parks and recreational amenities can greatly influence those decisions. 
While parks can influence people’s choices of which communities or neighborhoods are 
most desirable to live in, this factor alone is not enough to influence political decision makers to 
invest more generously on parks. What often goes unnoticed in evaluating the value of parks in 
neighborhoods, is the amount of financial return they can provide by increasing the value of nearby 
properties. Studies conducted by Dr. John Crompton at Texas A & M University show that 
properties near or adjacent to passive parks and open spaces can average a 5-20% higher assessed 
value than those located away from a park’s influence. (Figure 2) The higher value of those 
properties means their owners pay higher property taxes. Crompton refers to this as the 
The Proximate Principle

“Proximate Principle.” He further notes the incremental increase in taxes paid by each property 
owner because of the nearby park, when aggregated, can be enough to pay for the park’s acquisition 
and development and in some cases, its long term maintenance. (Crompton, Financing and 
Acquiring Parks and Recreation Resources, 1999)

Can Parks Pay for Themselves?
To illustrate the financial gain of the “Proximate Principle” to a local government, Crompton 
presents a hypothetical scenario in which a city invests $1M to acquire and develop a park, with a 
20 year debt service payment of $90K per year. (Table1). As shown, in comparison to an average 
valued home of $200K located outside the proximate influence of the 50 acre park, homes located 
within the three zones adjacent to the park have an incremental increase in value, and property 
taxes that equal $98K per year. If the land for the park was donated or acquired through park 
development fees, that $98K per year can potentially more than offset the cost to maintain the park, 
depending on the park’s features.

Parks as Business and Workforce Attractors
Taking an even deeper look at Crompton’s evaluation of proximate property values and 
related increased tax revenue, an argument can be made that it is less costly for a city to maintain a 
passive park than to provide full city services and collect taxes on the same tract of land if it were 
developed for residential use instead. Let’s assume the same 50 acre site in Figure 2 was developed 
with three home sites per acre, and the total property tax rate (including city, county and schools) 
is 2.5% of the market value of the $200,000 homes. The annual property tax revenue would be 
$750,000 (50 acres x 3 homes/acre x $5,000 annual tax). If the annual cost of servicing those 
residences is 15% higher than the taxes received, the annual net loss to the community for 
servicing the homes in that development would be $112,500 ([(15% x $750,000) - $750,000)]). 
Thus if the operation and maintenance costs for the same land used as a park were less than 
$112,500 per year, then it would be a less expensive option to service the land as a park than a 
housing development on the same site (Crompton, 1999)
As previously discussed, people have many choices when it comes to where they want to 
live. The existence of attractive open spaces and well-maintained parks with a variety of amenities 
can influence those decisions. Likewise, businesses have many choices as to where they locate. One 
of the most pressing issues facing governmental agencies is the desire and need to increase their 
commercial tax base through business retention and development. With so many companies closing 
their doors or moving operations overseas during the economic downturn, the competition to 
attract and sustain commercial development in communities across America has become fiercer in
