# Summary of the new feature/enhancement
PowerToys Run does not function well as a focus switcher. Run lists running
processes in the dropdown, but not the first result and prefers to create a
new process instead of focusing on open processes. There should be an option
to prioritize running processes in the dropdown.
## Description of use
A new option appears under the PowerTools Run settings to enable running
process prioritization.
Opening PowerTools Run should bring up the usual menu, and when a query is
searched, any results matching the query that are running processes should be
prioritized in the results.
