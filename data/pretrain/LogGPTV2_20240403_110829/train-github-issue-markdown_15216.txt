#### Description
The first and second image of the doc of Variable Bayesian Gaussian Mixture
are the same. This is due to a simple typo in the file name.
While fixing this, as per @tguillemot 's advice, it might be beneficial to
modify plot_concentration_prior.py too, since the default value of the `align`
parameter of `ax.bar()` has changed from `edge` to `center` in matplotlib 2.0
(changelog), so the bar charts are off when the script is run with matplotlib
2.
I am sending a PR.
