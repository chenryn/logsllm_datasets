There is one feature in Sublime Text 2 that I often use and it really makes my
day. It has the option to save all of your open tabs and window setup as a
'Project'. This really comes in handy as a designer working on applications
that have multiple views and scss files. It saves the project as 'project
name.sublime-project. That way if I have to quickly change gears to work
different files, I can easily return to a complex project with one action.
Also, consider adding functions/actions or default key commands to appropriate
file menus in the application bar. I feel it would dramatically help
feature/function discoverability. A lot of designers won't have experience
with Vim, etc and may want to start with Atom as it is, out of the box before
customizing keybindings.
I am really looking forward to moving over to Atom full-time and send mad
props to your team. It's amazing to witness Atom coming to life.
