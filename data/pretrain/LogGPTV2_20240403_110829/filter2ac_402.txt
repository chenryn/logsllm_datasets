title:blackhat:us-21 Can You Hear Me Now? Remote Eavesdropping Vulnerabilities in Mobile Messaging Applications
On January 29, 2019, a serious vulnerability was discovered by multiple parties in Group FaceTime which allowed an attacker to call a target and force the call to connect without user interaction from the target, allowing the attacker to listen to the target's surroundings without their knowledge or consent. While this remarkable bug was soon fixed, it presented a new and unresearched attack surface in mobile applications that support video conferencing. This presentation covers my attempts to find similar bugs in other messaging applications, including Signal, JioChat, Mocha, Google Duo, and Facebook Messenger.
