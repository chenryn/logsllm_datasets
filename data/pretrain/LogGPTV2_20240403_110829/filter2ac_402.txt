**Title: Can You Hear Me Now? Remote Eavesdropping Vulnerabilities in Mobile Messaging Applications (Black Hat US 2021)**

On January 29, 2019, a significant vulnerability was discovered in Group FaceTime by multiple parties. This flaw allowed an attacker to initiate a call and force it to connect without any interaction from the target, enabling the attacker to eavesdrop on the target's surroundings without their knowledge or consent. Although this critical bug was quickly addressed, it highlighted a new and previously unexplored attack surface in mobile applications that support video conferencing.

In this presentation, I will discuss my efforts to identify similar vulnerabilities in other popular messaging applications, including Signal, JioChat, Mocha, Google Duo, and Facebook Messenger. The goal is to raise awareness of these potential security risks and encourage more robust security measures in the development of such applications.
