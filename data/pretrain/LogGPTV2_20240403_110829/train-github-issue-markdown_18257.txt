### Expected results
I want create a role only the given dashboard can be shown to him, but I can
only limit his access on datasource. In another word, I want to create 2 or
more different dashboards based on the same datasource, and a specified user
can only see one of them. But I can't do that based on the existing security
model. Is there any suggestions?
