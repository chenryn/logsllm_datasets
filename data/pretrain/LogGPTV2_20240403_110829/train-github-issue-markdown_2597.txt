    What is the expected output?
    There should be a way to access the full information a driver has for result columns.
    Workarounds are brittle and slow. They depend on the struct layout, require reflect or
    unsafe and involve some duplication.
    What do you see instead?
    I can only get the names by calling Columns(). The rest of the result metadata can not
    be retrieved.
    Please provide any additional information below.
    I posted a proposal on go-nuts:
    https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/golang-nuts/2aLctcVyp6Q
    In short, I propose to add a new interface to database/sql/driver that passes a callback
    function to the driver.
    The callback is returned after a type assertion in database/sql.Register.
    It can be used to get the driver.Rows implementation given database/sql/Row[s].
    The native Rows implementation by the driver is returned as interface{}.
    Given this function, a driver can decide to expose more detailed metadata for the result
    columns by implementing the interface and providing an exported function that retrieves
    the metadata from *Row or *Rows.
