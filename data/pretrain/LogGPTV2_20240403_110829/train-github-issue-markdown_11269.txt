**Is this a BUG REPORT or FEATURE REQUEST?** (choose one):  
Bug report
**Kubernetes version** (use `kubectl version`):  
1.4.4 client, 1.4.6 cluster
**Environment** :
  * **Cloud provider or hardware configuration** : GKE
**What happened** :  
Ran `kubectl apply -f ...`, updating the version for an image.  
Observed the existing RS scale to zero before the new RS was ready (the
container has a readinessProbe), resulting in downtime.
**What you expected to happen** :  
Traffic remains routed to the existing RS until the new RS is ready.
**How to reproduce it** (as minimally and precisely as possible):  
https://gist.github.com/c82ae5cf2919684926b8bcc23d6ccddc
`kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml`
Wait for it to start serving.  
Modify something like the "env" in deployment.yaml  
Run `kubectl apply`.
Observe that the old RC is immediately scaled to zero.
**Anything else do we need to know** :  
N/A
