**Type of Issue:**
- **Bug Report**

**Kubernetes Version:**
- Client: 1.4.4
- Cluster: 1.4.6

**Environment:**
- Cloud Provider: Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)

**Issue Description:**
- **What happened:**
  - I ran `kubectl apply -f ...` to update the image version.
  - The existing ReplicaSet (RS) scaled down to zero before the new RS was ready (the container has a readinessProbe).
  - This resulted in downtime.

- **Expected Behavior:**
  - Traffic should continue to be routed to the existing RS until the new RS is ready.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Apply the initial deployment using `kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml`.
2 - Wait for the deployment to start serving.
3. Modify the `env` section in `deployment.yaml`.
4. Reapply the updated configuration with `kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml`.
5. Observe that the old ReplicaController (RC) is immediately scaled to zero.

**Additional Information:**
- N/A
