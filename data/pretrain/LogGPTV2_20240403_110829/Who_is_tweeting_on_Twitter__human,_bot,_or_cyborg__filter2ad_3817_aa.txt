**Abstract:**
Twitter is a web application that combines online social networking and micro-blogging. Users communicate by publishing text-based posts, known as tweets. The platform's popularity and open structure have attracted a significant number of automated programs, or bots, which can be both beneficial and harmful. Legitimate bots generate useful content like news and updates, while malicious bots spread spam and malicious content. Additionally, there are cyborgs, which are either bot-assisted humans or human-assisted bots. To help users identify the nature of the accounts they interact with, this paper focuses on classifying Twitter accounts into three categories: human, bot, and cyborg. We conducted large-scale measurements on over 500,000 accounts to observe differences in tweeting behavior, content, and account properties. Based on these observations, we propose a classification system that includes an entropy-based component, a machine-learning-based component, an account properties component, and a decision maker. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed system.

**Introduction:**
Twitter, launched in 2006, is a popular online social networking and micro-blogging tool. Its simplicity is a key feature, with users interacting via text-based posts (tweets) limited to 140 characters. Hashtags (words prefixed with #) group tweets by topic, and the @ symbol followed by a username directs tweets to specific users. Twitter's user relationships are directed, with users following others to receive their tweets. Since 2009, Twitter has seen a surge in popularity, attracting 190 million visitors per month and generating 65 million tweets daily as of June 2010. It has evolved from a personal micro-blogging site to an information network, with applications in business, customer service, political campaigns, and emergency communication.

The open nature of Twitter has made it a target for automated programs, or bots. While legitimate bots provide valuable content, malicious bots spread spam and malware. In between, there are cyborgs, which are bot-assisted humans or human-assisted bots. Automation is a double-edged sword, enhancing information flow but also enabling spam and malicious activities. This paper aims to characterize and classify Twitter accounts into human, bot, and cyborg categories to improve community management and user experience.

**Related Work:**
Previous studies on Twitter have focused on understanding its usage and network properties. Java et al. [24] categorized Twitter posts and roles, while Krishnamurthy et al. [25] classified users based on follower-to-following ratios. Yardi et al. [43] investigated spam on Twitter, and Kim et al. [10] analyzed Twitter lists. Our work differs by focusing on a larger dataset (over 500,000 users) and linking measurements to automation. We also introduce new metrics, such as entropy of tweet intervals, and compare Twitter to other social networks and text-based message systems.

**Measurement:**
We collected data from over 500,000 Twitter users using two methods: Depth-First Search (DFS) crawling and public timeline API. DFS crawling, starting with five random seeds, traversed the network to log 429,423 users. The public timeline API, which collects active users, added 82,984 more users. We manually classified a subset of 3,000 users (1,000 each for human, bot, and cyborg) to create a ground truth dataset. This dataset, containing 8,350,095 tweets, was used to extract features for classification.

**Conclusion:**
This paper presents a comprehensive study on classifying Twitter accounts into human, bot, and cyborg categories. Our large-scale measurements and proposed classification system, which includes entropy, machine learning, and account properties, demonstrate effective results. This work contributes to better understanding and managing the diverse user base on Twitter.
