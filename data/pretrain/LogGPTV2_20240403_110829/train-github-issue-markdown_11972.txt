Numpy 1.8.2 with python 2.7.6 has unconsistent behaviour when doing inplace
division of arrays exceeding the buffer size.
    import numpy as np
    arr = np.random.rand(2, 5000)
    arr_copy = arr.copy()
    arr_copy = arr_copy / arr_copy[0]
    arr /= arr[0]
    print np.sum(arr != arr_copy), arr.size - np.sum(np.isclose(arr, arr_copy))
Should print 0 for equal divisions.  
This can be circumvented by increasing the buffersize, nevertheless it should
be emphasized, that this can happen.
