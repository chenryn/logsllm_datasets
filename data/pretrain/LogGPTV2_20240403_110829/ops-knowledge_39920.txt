Subject: Seeking Advice on Developing Distributed Applications with Python

Hello Everyone,

I hope this message finds you well. I have been developing with Python for approximately a year and am now looking to expand my skills by building distributed applications that can communicate with each other. However, I am unsure which module would be the most suitable for my needs, and I would greatly appreciate your guidance and advice.

### Requirements:
- **Client-Server Communication:** The client and server must be able to communicate and exchange data seamlessly.
- **Task Scheduling:** Tasks need to be scheduled on both the server and client, similar to how cron jobs work. There is no need for automatic task consumption.
- **Cross-Platform Support:** The final application should be compilable into an executable (exe), app, or package that supports Windows, macOS, and Linux. The clients or workers should be lightweight, while the servers can be more resource-intensive.

### Challenges:
- **Web Application Focus:** Most of the solutions I've come across, such as Django and Celery, are geared towards web applications. While I do need a daemon worker, I am not interested in the full web application stack.
- **Code Packaging:** I prefer to compile the code into a single executable, but PyInstaller does not fully support some of the modules I'm considering, such as Celery.
- **Module Selection:** After extensive research, I have narrowed down my options to Celery, ZeroMQ, and Pyro. However, I am still uncertain about which one would be the best fit for my requirements.

### Specific Questions:
- **Celery vs. Pyro:** If the individual tasks do not need to communicate with each other, Celery seems like a good option. However, if inter-task communication is necessary, Pyro might be more appropriate due to its ability to facilitate communication between tasks/objects running in parallel on worker nodes.
- **ZeroMQ:** I am also considering ZeroMQ for its messaging capabilities, but I am unsure about its compatibility with cross-platform compilation.

Please share your thoughts and experiences with these or any other relevant modules. Your advice will be invaluable as I move forward with this project.

Thank you in advance for your help.

Best regards,
Kumar
