User: I am trying to get Python to call a Java program using a command that works when I enter it into the command line.
When I have Python try it with subprocess or os.system, it says:

'java' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable
  program or batch file.

From searching, I believe it is because when executing through Python, it will not be able to find java.exe like a normal command would.
Assistant: give absolute path of java location 
in my system path is C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_45\bin\java.exe
