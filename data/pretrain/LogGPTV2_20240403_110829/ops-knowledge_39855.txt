User: I want to have a property on a database model of mine in Google App Engine and I am not sure which category works the best.  I need it to be a tag cloud similar to the Tags on SO.  Would a text property be best or should I use a string property and make it repeated=True.
The second seems best to me and then I can just divide the tags up with a comma as a delimiter.  My goal is to be able to search through these tags and count the total number of each type of tag.
Does this seem like a reasonable solution?
Assistant: A repeated string property is your best option.
