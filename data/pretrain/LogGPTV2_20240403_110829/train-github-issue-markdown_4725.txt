 **What is the current behavior?**
When I using DefinePlugin to inject `process.env` variable into the package,
the output file will contain hundreds of duplicated the variable object (in
everywhere the code use it) like this:
    {NODE_ENV:"production"}.NODE_ENV
Even I activated the `--optimize-dedupe` argument it still happens.
**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**
Just try this configuration:
    new webpack.DefinePlugin({
    	'process.env': JSON.stringify({
    		NODE_ENV: process.env.NODE_ENV
    	})
    })
**What is the expected behavior?**
I am expecting any variable injected by DefinePlugin should only present once
in the output code as an internal module. And when any usage of the variables
it could just be like a requirement.
Because if it act like current, the size of output file will be very huge with
several injected variables.
Hope you could help on this.
