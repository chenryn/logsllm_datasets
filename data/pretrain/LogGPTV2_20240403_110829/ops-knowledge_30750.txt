User: I am learning Python and DJango and I am relatively nub with Linux. When I create DJango project I have manage.py file which I can execute like ./manage.py runserver. However when I create some Python program by hand it looks like that my Linux trying to execute it using Bash, not Python. So i need to write python foo.py instead ./foo.py. Attributes of both files manage.py and foo.py are the same (-rwx--x---). So my Q is: where is difference and how I can execute python program without specifying python? Links to any documentations are very appreciate. Thanks.
Assistant: Save your python code file somewhere, using "Save" or "Save as" in your editor. Lets call it 'first.py' in some folder, like "pyscripts" that you make on your Desktop. Open a prompt (a Windows 'cmd' shell that is a text interface into the computer): start > run > "cmd".
