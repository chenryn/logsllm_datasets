User: What I really like about Entity framework is its drag and drop way of making up the whole model layer of your application. You select the tables, it joins them and you're done. If you update the database scheda, right click -> update and you're done again.
This seems to me miles ahead the competiting ORMs, like the mess of XML (n)Hibernate requires or the hard-to-update Django Models.
Without concentrating on the fact that maybe sometimes more control over the mapping process may be good, are there similar one-click (or one-command) solutions for other (mainly open source like python or php) programming languages or frameworks?
Thanks
Assistant: I have heard iBattis is good.  A few companies fall back to iBattis when their programmer teams are not capable of understanding Hibernate (time issue).
Personally, I still like Linq2Sql.  Yes, the first time someone needs to delete and redrag over a table seems like too much work, but it really is not.  And the time that it doesn't update your class code when you save is really a pain, but you simply control-a your tables and drag them over again.  Total remakes are very quick and painless.  The classes it creates are extremely simple.  You can even create multiple table entities if you like with SPs for CRUD.
Linking SPs to CRUD is similar to EF: You simply setup your SP with the same parameters as your table, then drag it over your table, and poof, it matches the data types.
A lot of people go out of their way to take IQueryable away from the repository, but you can limit what you link in linq2Sql, so IQueryable is not too bad.
Come to think of it, I wonder if there is a way to restrict the relations (and foreign keys).
