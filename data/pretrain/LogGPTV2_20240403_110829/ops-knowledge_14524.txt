User: I have a bunch of files.  Some are Unix line endings, many are DOS.  I'd like to test each file to see if if is dos formatted, before I switch the line endings.
How would I do this?  Is there a flag I can test for? Something similar?
Assistant: dos linebreaks are \r\n, unix only \n. So just search for \r\n.
