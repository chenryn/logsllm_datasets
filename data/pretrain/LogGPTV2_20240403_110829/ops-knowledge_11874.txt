User: I have python 2.6 and python installed on my Freebsd box. I want my bash script to execute a particular python script using python2.6 interpreter. It is showing import error....
Undefined symbol "PyUnicodeUCS2_DecodeUTF8"
Assistant: It is probably caused by the following. 
Your script imports some third-party library which was compiled by an older python version.
To fix this, reinstall the up-to-date library.
