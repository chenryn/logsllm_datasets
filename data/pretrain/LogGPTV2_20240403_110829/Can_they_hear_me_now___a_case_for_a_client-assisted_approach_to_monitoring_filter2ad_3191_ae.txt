parison to our extensive measurements collected.
zone in Madison, we need 90 TCP packet measurements to
obtain an accuracy within 97% of the expected measure-
ment for NetA . From the same table, we can estimate the
expected TCP throughput which is within 97% of the ex-
pected throughput by collecting as many as 40 back-to-back
measurement packets for NetC for both TCP and UDP. The
number of packets are marginally higher for NetA as com-
pared to NetB and NetC as the network performance varies
more for NetA clients (Figure 5, Table 4).
For the zone in New Brunswick, we ﬁnd that we need
120 packets for estimating the TCP and UDP performance
of NetB network. Whereas, for the NetC network we need
to send only 70 UDP and 50 TCP packets back-to-back for
a estimation accuracy of 97%. With an expected cellular
data-rate in hundreds of Kbps, a client can thus, ﬁnish a
measurement in less than a second.
Summary: We validate that network performance esti-
mation using a small number of measurements collected by
diﬀerent clients inside a zone is indeed feasible. Speciﬁcally,
we ﬁnd that for the monitored zone, the distribution of the
observed metric becomes almost similar to that of any other
client present in the same zone (or from the same client at
an earlier time epoch) we have accumulated more than 80
packets.
3.4 Putting it all together
We envision a simple user agent in each client device, e.g.,
as part of the software in the mobile phones or bundled with
drivers of cellular NICs. A measurement coordinator, de-
ployed by the operator or by third-party users, will manage
the entire measurement process. Each cellular device peri-
odically reports its coarse-grained zone (based on associated
cellular tower) to the measurement coordinator3. Based on
this zone information, our measurement coordinator period-
ically provides each mobile device with a measurement task
list.
When a mobile device performs a task, it is required to
collect more precise zone information at which the task is
initiated as well as completed.
If the mobile phone has a
built-in GPS receiver, it is possible for it to obtain zone in-
formation quite easily. However, alternate techniques to ob-
tain zone information include triangulation and ﬁngerprint-
ing based techniques, using the cellular, WiFi, or Bluetooth
interfaces [23, 24, 25].
3Current cellular systems already collect such zone informa-
tion from all mobile devices in order to correctly and quickly
route calls and traﬃc to them.
The rate of refreshing the measurements for each zone
would depend on the coherence period of that zone as de-
termined by looking at the Allan deviation.
For a given zone, once in every coherence time-period, the
measurement coordinator will provide a measurement task
to each active mobile client with a probability, chosen such
that the number of measurement samples collected over each
iteration is suﬃcient for estimating accurate statistics, as de-
termined by the NKLD algorithm. Once the selected clients
report their measurements, the server checks if the measured
statistic has changed substantially from its previous update
(say by more than twice the standard deviation). In such
a situation the server would update its record for the zone
with the new value.
Validation: To analyze the accuracy of our WiScape
framework, we partitioned our Standalone dataset which
consists of around 400 zones with 200 or more samples, into
two subsets (Client sourced data and Ground truth). For
each zone, we assume that the entire Ground truth set pro-
vides our expected value (consisting of up to 125,000 packets
for various zones). Figure 8 shows the CDF of error in esti-
mation of TCP throughput for the WiScape data from the
Client sourced dataset and the Ground truth data. As can
be seen from the plot, WiScape data has less than 4% error
in estimating the TCP throughput for more than 70% of the
zones. The maximum error in performance measurements is
around 15%, which indicates that WiScape is able to deter-
mine the necessary measurement parameters for each zone
and provide a fairly accurate performance estimate.
Discussion: We note that there is an important trade oﬀ
between the volume of measurements collected, the ensuing
accuracy, and the energy and monetary costs incurred. Our
design in WiScape deﬁnes one speciﬁc design choice in this
multi-dimensional space. Many other alternatives are cer-
tainly possible and would make for interesting exploration
in the future.
4. APPLICATIONS OF WISCAPE
In Section 4.1 we demonstrate how client-assisted moni-
toring of networks can help discover zones with highly vari-
able network performance. Variability in network perfor-
mance can be an indicator of possible network problems.
Hence, client-assisted monitoring can help network opera-
tors short-list zones which need further detailed diagnosis.
Finally, in Section 4.2 we characterize the potential perfor-
mance enhancement for two applications when using coarse
grained measurements. Both applications use more than one
cellular network.
4.1 Helping operators
To ensure that the network performance at the deployed
regions is above a certain quality, the cellular service providers
carry out periodic drive-by tests to validate the performance
of their network. This involves using a car equipped with
network measurement equipment, and then carrying out net-
work performance tests at speciﬁc locations. However, such
tests are labor intensive and hence not scalable for wide
area wireless networks. Client-assisted monitoring can help
network operators in this regards by pin-pointing zones with
performance characteristics signiﬁcantly diﬀerent than neigh-
boring zones.

dard deviation/average) of TCP throughput for all
zones (with 250 meter radius) and those with more
than 20 days with at least one ping failure.
Identifying locations with variable performance
Let us assume the network operator intends to determine
potential locations with highly variable throughput (say rel-
ative standard deviation greater than 20%). This informa-
tion would be diﬃcult to deduce from a relatively low num-
ber of client sourced measurements because of the fact that
the accuracy of client sourcing depends on low variability
in network performance. We note that while small through-
put tests conducted infrequently every tens of minutes might
miss out on zones with highly variable performance, other
infrequently calculated metrics may be used to detect such
variability. To highlight such a metric, we revisit our Stan-
dalone dataset. As mentioned in Section 2, we present data
for ICMP ping tests in our Standalone dataset. From this
dataset, we ﬁrst determine zones, with radius 250 meters,
that have multiple ping test failures. In Figure 9 we present
the CDF of relative standard deviation of all the zones with
more than 200 measurements and those zones with at least
one failed ping tests every day, for a period of 20 consecu-
tive days or more. As can be seen from the plot, zones with
20 or more consecutive days with at least one ping failure
have a very high variation in their relative deviation of TCP
throughput. For example, 65% of the links have a relative
deviation of the order of 40%. We also ﬁnd that zones with
back-to-back ping failures constitute 97% of the zones with
relative standard deviation above 20%. This is in contrast
with the majority of other zones which have less than 1%
relative standard deviation.
Identifying locations for additional provisioning
Coarse grained estimates can also help network operators de-
termine places where additional resources might be needed
to satisfy periodic surge in demands. For example, Fig-
ure 10, shows the network latency of two cellular networks
near a football stadium (80,000 seating capacity) during a
football game. The shaded region in the plot represents the
scheduled time of the football game. As can be seen from
the plot, for the duration of the game the average ping la-
tencies go up from 113msec to 418msec, an increase of the
order of 3.7X for NetB. As the duration is in order of 100s
of minutes, infrequent periodic monitoring can detect the
above event and help operators take corrective measures.

utes) during a football game. The scheduled time of
the game is covered by the shaded region.
4.2 Improving client performance
To show the potential beneﬁts of a WiScape like system for
clients, in Section 4.2.1 we show that for a large number of
zones the performance of one cellular network is persistently
better than other networks over large duration of time, and
hence observable using infrequent measurements.
In Sec-
tion 4.2.2 we explain how such information can be utilized
by clients with multiple cellular connections to choose the
best network of operation for each zone.
4.2.1 Persistent network dominance
We intend to understand if the relative performance char-
acteristics of diﬀerent cellular networks are persistent over
large periods of time (for each zone). For this purpose, we
deﬁne persistent network dominance as follows: when the
lower 5 percentile of the best network’s metric is better than
the upper 95 percentile of other networks in a given zone,
we say the zone is persistently dominated by the best net-
work. The fact that the lowest 5 percentile of performance
of the dominant network is better than the 95 percentile of
the other networks implies that the dominance is persistent
over time and hence observable using infrequent measure-
ments made by a WiScape like system.
In Figure 11, we
present the percentage of zones with a persistently domi-
nant network, in terms of RTT latency collected from the
WiRover dataset, as a function of the zone size. As we
see, persistent network dominance is observed in 85% of the
zones and across diﬀerent zone sizes. The consistently better
performance of one network at a given zone can be explained
by observing that the network performance is dependent on
the base-station location, technology, and traﬃc load on the
base-station; a combination which would be expected to vary
across diﬀerent network operators.
We use measurement data from our Short segment dataset
to further investigate the presence of persistent network dom-
inance. The measurements were collected with our vehicle
driving across this stretch of roadway regularly for a period
of 5 months, at average speeds of 55 km/h. We show a part
(10 km) of the road stretch in Figure 12. Each circle cor-
responds to a zone of 250 meters radius and the shade on
the circle corresponds to the network which performs best
in that zone.
We plot average TCP throughput performance of NetA,
NetB, and NetC networks for each zone over entire exper-
iment duration in Figure 13. In conformance with our ob-
servations of persistent dominance in terms of latencies, we

Figure 12: Map depicting the Short segment dataset
and the dominant network for each zone. Over all
zones we observe that 52% of zones have a dominant
network.
ﬁnd that for a signiﬁcant number of zones a speciﬁc network
oﬀers better performance on an average than the other two
networks. For example, at zone 20 (as marked in the x-
axis) the performance diﬀerence between the best network
gives 42% higher throughput than the next best network
over the entire measurement set. Similarly, the performance
at zone 4 of the best network is almost 30% higher than
others. We also ﬁnd that multiple zones exist where none of
the networks give clear performance advantage for the en-
tire set of measurements. We identify zones where the lower
5 percentile of the best performing network is better than
the upper 95 percentile of other two networks. The inset
table in Figure 12 shows the number of zones where one
network dominates other networks. From the table we note
that there are 52% of zones where one network gives better
performance than other consistently over the measurement
period. We color the zones in Figure 12 based on which
network dominates it. A white color indicates a lack of a
persistently dominant network.
4.2.2 Application performance improvement
We present two application scenarios which can beneﬁt
from approximate network quality estimates for a speciﬁc
location. The ﬁrst is a client equipped with a mobile phone
that has two or more SIM cards and hence can connect to
any one of two or more alternate cellular networks at a given
point in time. We call this the multi-sim application. Such
phones are cheaply available in the market today, e.g., Sam-
sung Fizz [26] and Jinpeng S3288 [27], and are gaining in
popularity in developing countries like India and China. In
