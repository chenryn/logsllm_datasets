**Figure 8** illustrates the error in WiScape measurements compared to our extensive dataset. In the Madison zone, we need 90 TCP packet measurements to achieve an accuracy within 97% of the expected measurement for NetA. For NetC, 40 back-to-back measurements are sufficient for both TCP and UDP to estimate the expected throughput within 97%. The number of packets required is slightly higher for NetA compared to NetB and NetC due to greater variability in network performance for NetA clients (refer to Figure 5 and Table 4).

In the New Brunswick zone, 120 packets are needed to estimate the TCP and UDP performance of NetB. For NetC, only 70 UDP and 50 TCP packets are required for a 97% estimation accuracy. Given the expected cellular data rate in hundreds of Kbps, a client can complete a measurement in less than a second.

**Summary:**
We validate that network performance estimation using a small number of measurements from different clients within a zone is feasible. Specifically, we find that after accumulating more than 80 packets, the distribution of observed metrics becomes similar to that of any other client in the same zone or from the same client at an earlier time.

### 3.4 Putting It All Together

We envision a simple user agent in each client device, such as part of the software in mobile phones or bundled with drivers of cellular NICs. A measurement coordinator, deployed by the operator or a third-party, will manage the entire measurement process. Each cellular device periodically reports its coarse-grained zone (based on the associated cellular tower) to the measurement coordinator. Based on this information, the coordinator provides each mobile device with a measurement task list.

When a mobile device performs a task, it must collect precise zone information at the start and end of the task. If the mobile phone has a built-in GPS receiver, obtaining this information is straightforward. Alternative techniques include triangulation and fingerprinting using cellular, WiFi, or Bluetooth interfaces [23, 24, 25].

The rate of refreshing measurements for each zone depends on the coherence period, determined by the Allan deviation. For a given zone, the measurement coordinator will provide a measurement task to each active mobile client with a probability chosen to ensure sufficient samples for accurate statistics, as determined by the NKLD algorithm. Once the selected clients report their measurements, the server checks if the measured statistic has changed substantially (e.g., by more than twice the standard deviation). If so, the server updates its record for the zone with the new value.

**Validation:**
To analyze the accuracy of our WiScape framework, we partitioned our Standalone dataset, which consists of around 400 zones with 200 or more samples, into two subsets: Client-sourced data and Ground truth. For each zone, we assume the entire Ground truth set provides the expected value (up to 125,000 packets for various zones). Figure 8 shows the CDF of the error in estimating TCP throughput for the WiScape data from the Client-sourced dataset and the Ground truth data. As seen in the plot, WiScape data has less than 4% error in estimating TCP throughput for more than 70% of the zones. The maximum error is around 15%, indicating that WiScape can determine the necessary measurement parameters and provide a fairly accurate performance estimate.

**Discussion:**
There is an important trade-off between the volume of measurements collected, the ensuing accuracy, and the energy and monetary costs incurred. Our design in WiScape defines one specific design choice in this multi-dimensional space. Many other alternatives are possible and would make for interesting future exploration.

### 4. Applications of WiScape

#### 4.1 Helping Operators

To ensure network performance in deployed regions, cellular service providers conduct periodic drive-by tests. However, these tests are labor-intensive and not scalable for wide-area wireless networks. Client-assisted monitoring can help operators by pinpointing zones with significantly different performance characteristics compared to neighboring zones.

**Identifying Locations with Variable Performance:**
Assume the network operator wants to identify locations with highly variable throughput (e.g., relative standard deviation > 20%). This information is difficult to deduce from a low number of client-sourced measurements because accuracy depends on low variability. Small throughput tests conducted infrequently might miss highly variable zones, but other infrequently calculated metrics can detect such variability. We revisit our Standalone dataset, which includes ICMP ping test data. We first determine zones with a 250-meter radius that have multiple ping test failures. Figure 9 presents the CDF of the relative standard deviation of all zones with more than 200 measurements and those with at least one failed ping test every day for 20 consecutive days or more. Zones with 20 or more consecutive days of at least one ping failure show high variation in their relative deviation of TCP throughput. For example, 65% of the links have a relative deviation of around 40%. Zones with back-to-back ping failures constitute 97% of the zones with a relative standard deviation above 20%, contrasting with the majority of other zones, which have less than 1% relative standard deviation.

**Identifying Locations for Additional Provisioning:**
Coarse-grained estimates can help network operators determine where additional resources are needed to meet periodic surges in demand. For example, Figure 10 shows the network latency of two cellular networks near a football stadium (80,000 seating capacity) during a game. The shaded region represents the scheduled game time. During the game, the average ping latencies increase from 113 ms to 418 ms, a 3.7X increase for NetB. Infrequent periodic monitoring can detect such events and help operators take corrective measures.

#### 4.2 Improving Client Performance

**4.2.1 Persistent Network Dominance:**
We investigate whether the relative performance characteristics of different cellular networks are persistent over large periods for each zone. We define persistent network dominance as follows: when the lower 5th percentile of the best network's metric is better than the upper 95th percentile of other networks in a given zone, we say the zone is persistently dominated by the best network. This implies that the dominance is observable using infrequent measurements made by a WiScape-like system.

Figure 11 shows the percentage of zones with a persistently dominant network in terms of RTT latency from the WiRover dataset, as a function of zone size. Persistent network dominance is observed in 85% of the zones across different sizes. The consistently better performance of one network in a given zone can be attributed to factors such as base-station location, technology, and traffic load, which vary across different network operators.

Using data from our Short segment dataset, we further investigate persistent network dominance. The measurements were collected over 5 months with our vehicle driving at an average speed of 55 km/h. Figure 12 shows a 10 km stretch, with each circle representing a 250-meter radius zone. The shade indicates the best-performing network in that zone. Figure 13 plots the average TCP throughput performance of NetA, NetB, and NetC networks for each zone over the entire experiment duration. Consistent with our observations of persistent dominance in terms of latencies, we find that for a significant number of zones, a specific network offers better performance on average than the other two. For example, at zone 20, the best network provides 42% higher throughput than the next best network. Similarly, at zone 4, the best network's performance is almost 30% higher. Multiple zones exist where no network gives a clear performance advantage. The inset table in Figure 12 shows the number of zones where one network dominates others. From the table, 52% of zones have a persistently dominant network. Zones are colored based on the dominant network, with white indicating no persistent dominance.

**4.2.2 Application Performance Improvement:**
We present two application scenarios that benefit from approximate network quality estimates for specific locations. The first is a mobile phone with two or more SIM cards, allowing connection to multiple cellular networks. Such phones, like the Samsung Fizz [26] and Jinpeng S3288 [27], are gaining popularity in developing countries like India and China.
