## Abstract:
BulletProof Hosting (BPH) services provide criminal actors with resilient infrastructure that can withstand takedown attempts and complaints of illicit activities, serving as a fundamental building block for various types of cyber attacks. Recent anecdotal reports highlight an emerging trend where BPH services are reselling infrastructure from lower-end service providers (e.g., hosting ISPs, cloud hosting, and CDNs) rather than from monolithic BPH providers. This shift has rendered previous detection methods less effective, as the malicious infrastructure is now more agile and dispersed across a larger set of providers, including both benign and malicious clients.

In this paper, we present the first systematic study of this new trend in BPH services. By collecting and analyzing extensive data (25 Whois snapshots of the entire IPv4 address space, 1.5 TB of passive DNS data, and longitudinal data from several blacklist feeds), we identify a set of new features that uniquely characterize BPH on sub-allocations and are difficult to evade. Based on these features, we train a classifier to detect malicious sub-allocated network blocks, achieving a 98% recall and 1.5% false discovery rate. Using a conservatively trained version of our classifier, we scan the entire IPv4 address space and detect 39,000 malicious network blocks. This allows us to conduct a large-scale study of the BPH service ecosystem, revealing patterns such as the recycling of network blocks and the migration of malicious clients to different network blocks in an effort to evade IP-based blacklisting. Our study highlights the trend of agile BPH services and points to potential methods for detecting and mitigating this emerging threat.

## 1. Introduction
BulletProof Hosting (BPH) services rent out servers and networking infrastructure that persist in the face of takedown attempts and complaints of illicit activities. This BPH infrastructure is a critical component of the cyber-crime ecosystem, providing attackers with a stable base of operations for a wide range of illicit activities, from high-risk activities like botnet command and control, DDoS attacks, and phishing to less risky activities like hosting pirated media.

Initially, BPH infrastructure was provided by service providers who catered to criminal clients and ignored abuses on their networks. However, the static nature, high concentration of malicious activity, and poor reputation for responding to abuse complaints often led to the unilateral blacklisting of these BulletProof (BP) service providers' entire network allocations. Additionally, these BP service providers faced difficulties in finding peering points for stable network connectivity and, in extreme cases, were completely de-peered [1].

The increasing pressure on monolithic BP service providers has driven them to transform their operations to evade service provider (Autonomous System or AS) reputation-based defenses, such as BGP Ranking [6] and ASwatch [7]. An emerging trend is that BPH services are now establishing reseller relationships with primarily lower-end hosting service providers [2]. These lower-end service providers are often not complicit in supporting illicit activity but may be more lenient on illicit behavior or do not invest much effort in proactively detecting or remediating malicious activities on their networks [2]. This arrangement provides good cover for BPH services, allowing them to leverage the better reputation of the parent providers and mix legitimate and BPH resellers. Figure 1 illustrates this BPH ecosystem, which largely prevents unilateral actions against the whole service provider.

This type of BPH infrastructure is not truly bulletproof, as the BPH service will eventually have to move clients to new IP addresses and network blocks. However, because the BPH service rents rather than owns the infrastructure, this strategy enables them to become more nimble and quickly move clients when detected.

Detecting these nimble BPH services operating within lower-end service providers presents new technical challenges. Unilaterally blacklisting these lower-end service providers is not feasible due to the collateral damage it would cause. Instead, Internet monitoring organizations must detect and point-wise blacklist IP addresses, leading to a "whack-a-mole" scenario where blacklisted IP addresses are made ephemeral by the BPH services moving clients to new IP addresses. What is needed is the ability to peer into a service provider and identify larger sets of IP addresses allocated to a reseller, quickly determining the reputation of this address set. This will enable a middle ground between coarse-grain AS-level blacklisting and fine-grain IP address reputation approaches, improving our ability to mitigate these emerging BPH service strategies.

## 2. Background

### A. BulletProof Hosting
BulletProof Hosting services are a fundamental part of the cyber-crime ecosystem, offering a safe haven for miscreants seeking to host abusive content. These services are resilient in the face of takedown efforts, providing various protection mechanisms to their ill-willed clients, depending on the BPH service, the money invested by their clients, and the authoritative party involved. For example, abuse complaints generated by network administrators and ISPs can be ignored, while blacklisting by a highly influential party such as SpamHaus [3] could cause the BPH service to move the reported client(s) to a different network.

BPH services have various structures. Traditional centralized BPH services have hardware physically placed in bunkers and protected by armed guards, e.g., cyberbunker.com. These services operate BulletProof Autonomous Systems (BP ASes) geared towards hosting malicious content and are highly stable. On the other end, more fragile hosting services sell access to compromised machines for a small one-time charge. The duration of access depends on factors such as the number of complaints, when the service provider blocks access, or when the maintainers of the machine detect and evict the malicious intruders.

More recently, BPH services are evolving and moving away from dedicated BP ASes to legitimate ASes to blend in and hide their clients' traffic among legitimate network traffic. This renders AS blacklists, such as BGP Ranking [6] and ASwatch [7], impractical, as blocking the whole AS would disrupt legitimate services. This type of BPH often takes advantage of the reseller programs offered by legitimate providers.

### B. IP Address Allocation
The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) allocates IP addresses in large chunks to one of five Regional Internet Registries (RIRs). RIRs are nonprofit organizations that manage the registration of IP addresses in their regions by operating a directory service, Whois, to log and record all network block registrations. The Whois directory is object-oriented, with each network block represented by an inetnum object containing attributes such as IP address range, CIDR, network name, description, allocation type (direct vs. sub-allocation), organization, person(s), email, and modification date. Organization and person objects also contain identifying attributes and pointers to each other.

Unfortunately, the lack of strict verification and the ease of creating multiple Whois registrations allow BPH services to represent themselves as different entities with service providers and registries. This enables them to move clients between service providers and avoid IP blacklisting.

## 3. Methodology
To detect malicious sub-allocations, we created a set of methods to accurately identify malicious IP address network blocks. We used IP Whois information provided by all five RIRs to identify sub-allocations of network blocks and their owners. We then created a labeled dataset of benign and malicious network blocks based on manually compiled blacklists from Spamhaus [3] and lists of mostly benign network blocks from Alexa [4] and top hosting provider lists [5].

Using this labeled dataset, we discovered 14 key features that assist in detecting malicious network blocks, based on three data sources: Whois, Passive DNS (PDNS), and AS reputation lists. We trained two classifiers, Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forest (RF), achieving a 98% recall and 1.5% false discovery rate with 5-fold cross-validation.

## 4. Validation
We performed a systematic validation of the detected sub-allocations, which is known to be challenging. Our validation included conventional cross-validation on the labeled set, utilization of multiple labeled sets with different qualities, identification of signals of malicious behaviors, and random sampling. This ensures that the findings made by our system are of the highest possible quality.

## 5. Large-Scale Analysis
We ran a conservatively trained version of our classifier over all sub-allocations found over a nine-month period and detected 39,000 malicious network blocks. Based on these detected network blocks, we conducted a large-scale analysis of the BPH service ecosystem. Our analysis revealed previously unknown patterns characterizing the BPH infrastructure:

- **Parent Service Providers:** Many legitimate service providers were not responsive to complaints of abuse emanating from their networks (e.g., "PEG TECH INC"). Others were conducting their business in a manner highly indicative of complicity, such as aggressively recycling (rotating) network blocks and moving clients to new network blocks.
- **BPH Services:** BPH services were registering as resellers with service providers, crossing Whois registries, countries, and service providers by creating an abundance of Whois registrations. This enabled them to represent themselves as different entities with service providers and registries. We tracked the BPH services' movements from one service provider to another, enabling the restoration of their services after takedown efforts by parent service providers.
- **BPH Clients:** We tracked the clients of the BPH services by analyzing the domains hosted on the network blocks and found them to host a range of malicious activities, from Command and Control systems to hosting pirated content. We also tracked the movement of the clients through their domains and found many domains moving between at least two network blocks, allowing some domains to survive for up to 12 months before takedown.

## 6. Limitations and Future Work
While our method achieves high accuracy, it has limitations. The dynamic nature of BPH services and the continuous evolution of evasion techniques require ongoing updates to the detection system. Future work will focus on enhancing the detection capabilities, integrating real-time data, and developing more robust validation methods.

## 7. Related Work
Previous research on BPH has focused on traditional, centralized BPH services. Our work extends this by addressing the new trend of BPH services leveraging legitimate service providers. We build on existing methods for detecting malicious IP addresses and ASes but introduce novel features and a comprehensive validation approach.

## 8. Conclusion
This paper presents the first systematic study of the new trend in BPH services, where they resell infrastructure from lower-end service providers. By identifying unique features and training a classifier, we achieve high accuracy in detecting malicious sub-allocated network blocks. Our large-scale analysis provides insights into the BPH ecosystem, highlighting the need for more nuanced detection and mitigation strategies. Future work will continue to address the evolving nature of BPH services and improve detection methods.
