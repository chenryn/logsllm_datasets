### A Study of Burstiness in TCP Flows

#### Introduction
In this study, we analyze the burstiness in TCP flows by examining the inter-arrival times (IATs) of packets. We define a threshold value \( T \) to categorize the IATs and use the IAT as a measure of the scale of the flight, calling these units IAT units (IATU). For example, a flight of 1 IATU means that the observed IAT was different from the preceding and following IATs, while an IATU of 2 indicates that two successive IATs were nearly identical.

#### Small Timescale Flights (STFs)
Figure 5 illustrates a sequence of packet pairs where STFs do not capture complete information. The detection algorithm for STFs is as follows:

1. **Initialization**: Start with IAT = constant and flight size = 1.
2. **Comparison**: Compare the previous IAT with the current IAT and calculate \( g \) (as defined above).
3. **Threshold Check**:
   - If \( g \) is within the threshold, increment the flight size by 1.
   - If \( g \) is outside the threshold and the flight size > 1, start a new flight of size 0.
   - Otherwise, start a new flight of size 1.
4. **Update**: Set the previous IAT to the current IAT and repeat the process.

Figure 6 shows the distribution of small timescale flight sizes in IATU for BB1-2002. The left column in each set of bars represents flows greater than 3 packets in length; the middle column for those greater than 50; and the right column for flows greater than 100 packets in length. We observe that flights are usually small (in terms of IATU and hence in packets) regardless of the number of packets in the flow.

Figure 7 depicts the number of small timescale flights for trace BB1-2002 on a per-flow basis. The left histogram is for flows greater than 3 packets in length, the middle for those greater than 50, and the right histogram for flows greater than 100 packets in length. We notice that STFs are more common in flows with a larger number of packets.

#### Large Timescale Flights (LTFs)
We also consider flight behavior at the timescale of the round-trip time (RTT) seen by the flows. As previously noted, the STFs of which the LTFs are composed are an average of 2.5 packets in length. To estimate the number of packets in an LTF, we multiply its IATU size by this number.

Figure 8 shows the size distribution of LTFs. The statistics are quite different from the STF size distribution. Flights are much more common at the larger timescale, and the graph follows a distribution proportional to \( \frac{1}{\text{LTF size}} \). Thus, even at this timescale, the decay of flight sizes is fairly quick.

Figure 9 plots the distributions of the number of LTFs on a per-flow basis. We see that, similar to STFs, LTFs are much more common in flows with a large number of packets.

#### Conclusions
From the flight statistics observed, we draw the following conclusions:

1. **Initial Hypotheses**: Our model of TCP suggested two distinct aggregation levels at different timescales, caused by delayed acknowledgments (ACKs) and TCP window dynamics. These hypotheses are supported by the fact that we usually see short STFs, typically consisting of two or three packets, indicating delayed ACKs. We also observe much larger LTFs, indicative of windows of packets transmitted in pairs and triplets with similar spacings between the aggregations.

By analyzing both small and large timescale flights, we gain insights into the bursty nature of TCP flows and the underlying mechanisms that drive this behavior.
