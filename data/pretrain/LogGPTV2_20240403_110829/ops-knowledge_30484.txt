User: There is an Nginx configuration file, how to add a new reverse proxy service without affecting the existing functions?
Assistant: You can follow the steps below to add a new reverse proxy service: 1. Open the Nginx configuration file, usually located at /etc/nginx/nginx.conf or /usr/local/nginx/conf/nginx.conf. 2. Find the server section and add the new reverse proxy service as a new server section. For example: ``` server { listen 80; server_name example.com; location / { proxy_pass http://new-service.example.com; proxy_set_header Host $host; } } ``` Among them, listen specifies the listening port, server_name Specifies the domain name or IP address of the server, and location specifies the requested path. proxy_pass specifies the target server address of the reverse proxy, and proxy_set_header can set the request header information. 3. Save the configuration file and reload the Nginx service. You can check whether the Nginx configuration file is correct with the following command: ``` nginx -t ``` If the following output appears, the configuration file is correct: ``` nginx: the configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf syntax is ok nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test is successful ``` 4. Restart the Nginx service to make the configuration file take effect: ``` service nginx restart ``` Note : When modifying the Nginx configuration file, you need to be careful to prevent grammatical errors from affecting normal services. It is recommended to back up the original configuration file before modifying it.
