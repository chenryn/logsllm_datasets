The first three parts of the log are index, timestamp, and log level. Without considering these three parts, Here we assume that the variables in the logs are represented as '<*>', separated by spaces between tokens. What is the specific log template for the above logs?

A: Changing view acls to: <*> 和 SecurityManager: authentication disabled; ui acls disabled; users with view permissions: Set(yarn, curi); users with modify permissions: Set(yarn, curi)
B: Changing view acls to: <*> 和 Starting remoting
C: Times: total = <*>, boot = <*>, init = <*>, finish = <*> 和 Running task <*> in stage <*> (TID <*>)
D: Registered signal handlers for [TERM, HUP, INT] 和 Starting remoting

Assistant: Answer: C
