Came a across this very odd problem while trying to get difference between two
columns in a DataFrame of type datetime64. The following simple example
illustrates the problem:
    df = pd.DataFrame({'A': pd.date_range('20150301', '20150304'), 
                   'B': pd.date_range('20150303', '20150306')}, 
                   index = [1, 2, 3, 3])
    df
        A           B
    1   2015-03-01  2015-03-03
    2   2015-03-02  2015-03-04
    3   2015-03-03  2015-03-05
    3   2015-03-04  2015-03-06
    df.B - df.A
    1   2 days
    2   2 days
    3   2 days
    3   1 days
    3   3 days
    3   2 days
dtype: timedelta64[ns]
What happens generally is that the output contains an entry for the difference
in every pair in the Cartesian product of the rows containing the duplicate
index. I learned this the hard way on a df with 30K+ rows and only 50 distinct
indices ending up trying to compute a series with 385 million+ entries,
quickly freezing my computer.
On a related note, using the eval method to compute the difference throws the
following error:
    df.eval('B - A')
    ValueError: unkown type timedelta64[ns]
