### Establishing an Obstruction-Free Optical Path

To ensure that Free Space Optics (FSO) devices do not obstruct each other, we utilize ceiling mirrors as shown in Figure 1. The requirements for these mirrors are minimal; they must reflect infrared (IR) light, and many conventional mirrors are sufficient (as discussed in §3). The ceiling mirror does not need to be a single piece, and minor irregularities are unlikely to cause issues due to the misalignment tolerance of FSO links (§3.1).

### Network Provisioning

Ideally, we would like to have a large number of FSO devices per Top of Rack (ToR) switch. However, physical and geometric constraints limit this. For example, the finite size of FSO devices restricts the number that can be placed on a ToR. Therefore, we need to provision or pre-configure the network to ensure it is robust against future and unforeseen traffic patterns.

### Network Management

The FireFly controller dynamically selects the runtime topology and configures forwarding paths based on current traffic demands and events. We leverage software-defined networking (SDN) capabilities for data plane reconfiguration, as in prior work [12, 17, 38]. Each SDN-capable ToR switch reports observed traffic demands to the controller. FireFly can use other demand estimation algorithms, such as host buffer sizes [12] or new switch features [17]. Since our focus is on FireFly-specific aspects, we do not discuss these extensions further.

In the following sections, we describe the design of a viable steerable FSO link, network pre-configuration, and runtime network management.

## Practical Steerable FSO Design

For the FireFly vision to be deployed in a data center (DC), FSO devices must ideally have a small form factor, be low-cost commodity devices, have a low power footprint relative to switches, and be steerable to enable flexibility.

At first glance, these requirements seem at odds with today's commercial FSO devices, which are bulky, expensive, and power-intensive [5]. Achieving robust links at high data rates and long ranges is challenging and typically requires powerful lasers and expensive mechanisms for dynamic alignment, especially for outdoor use. Conventional FSO deployments provide fixed point-to-point links and do not focus on steerability.

In this section, we demonstrate that:
1. It is feasible to repurpose commodity DC-centric optical networking gear to establish robust and sufficiently long FSO links.
2. Existing commodity optical technologies can be leveraged to steer the FSO beam with high precision and low latency.

### FSO Link Engineering

We show that it is possible to engineer an FSO optical link using commodity DC-grade optical networking equipment that can achieve high data rates over distances suitable for DC-scale deployment, with sufficient (mis)alignment tolerance.

In the indoor, controlled DC setting, concerns about outdoor environmental factors largely disappear. However, we must carefully design the optical path to balance the tradeoff between laser beam divergence and misalignment tolerance.

Our FSO system couples two optical fiber endpoints directly with a free-space link, avoiding opto-electric conversion and thus saving power and cost. This Fiber–FSO–Fiber link connects to standard optical interconnect technology widely used in DCs (e.g., 10GBASE-SR). A typical interface is an optical SFP (small form-factor pluggable) or its variants such as SFP+.

This approach requires optical designs on both ends: 
1. On the transmit side, where the fiber 'launches' the laser beam into free space.
2. On the receive side, where the laser beam is received into the fiber (Figure 3(a)).

To minimize beam divergence, we collimate the beam using a suitably designed lens located at its focal length from the transmitting fiber endpoint. A similar lens near the receiving fiber endpoint focuses the beam back into the fiber.

The optical design ensures the laser beam maintains a sufficient width to tolerate minor misalignments due to rack vibrations and other effects. Wider beams can tolerate misalignments better but suffer from lower power density at the receiving end. Our design shows a good balance is possible using optical SFPs used for long-range fiber communications (e.g., 10GBASE-LR up to 10 km). These SFPs use highly sensitive detectors that can work with very little received power. Our current prototype has been tested for 20m, with a general design extending to 100m [27].

This approach satisfies all design requirements except steering. The lens is small (about 3 cm diameter) with a similar focal length. Including additional hardware, the assembly footprint is only 5 cm across. The costs are modest when procured in volume: ≈ $50 for the lens and $50 for the assembly. There might be an additional cost of using optical SFP (≈$100) if optical wired links are not already used. Finally, there is no additional power burden beyond the SFP power consumption.

### Prototype

We have developed a proof-of-concept prototype following the above design. We have successfully used both 1 Gbps and 10 Gbps links with very similar optical setups. The prototype links use 1000BASE-LX (1GBASE-LR) SFP (SFP+) for the 1 Gbps (10 Gbps) case and multi-mode fibers for their larger diameter. We first validate the design using a standard optical bench setup and then test the link in a production DC. Figure 3(a) shows the general setup.

For the current design, the collimated laser beam maintains a ≈4 mm diameter after convergence. To achieve a 20 m length on a small optical bench, we use multiple reflections via mirrors, validating the use of mirrors on the optical path and showing low optical loss due to reflections.

### Link Performance

We test the link by running continuous TCP transfers over the FSO link for several days at a time for selected link lengths. The results are very similar for different lengths. For brevity, we report the results for the longest tested case (≈20m) for the 10 Gbps link (Figure 3(c)). The distribution of TCP throughputs is almost identical to that observed over regular fiber links, demonstrating no additional loss in the FSO links.

To study misalignment tolerance, we shift the transmit side setup in tiny incremental steps perpendicular to the beam axis, keeping the receive side fixed. We see no throughput loss until a 6 mm shift, beyond which the link becomes unstable. This 6 mm tolerance is sufficient to handle minor misalignments due to rack vibrations and environmental issues in a DC.

### Developing Steering Mechanisms

Having established the viability of a point-to-point FSO link using commodity optics, we now focus on making the beam steerable to enable flexibility. Our goal is to develop a commoditizable design. We explore two promising solutions: switchable mirrors and Galvo mirrors. Both offer different tradeoffs in terms of latency, degree of flexibility, and cost/power, and no one solution is strictly better. Thus, it is instructive to understand and evaluate both alternatives and the tradeoffs they offer.

#### Switchable Mirrors (SMs)

Switchable mirrors (SMs) are made from a special liquid crystal material that can be electrically controlled to rapidly switch between reflection (mirror) and transparent (glass) states at millisecond timescales [4]. While the intended use cases are different (e.g., rear-view mirrors that switch between a regular mirror and a backup camera display), we can use them for beam steering (Figure 4(a)).

To understand the link performance in a real environment, we set up the link in a production (university-run) DC. Unlike the optical bench, this real environment has several key differences that can produce misalignments: racks experience vibrations due to server fans, disks, HVAC, and UPS units, and the beam could 'wander' due to fluctuating air density caused by temperature variations. We set up the FSO link with optical components placed on top of the rack using magnetic bases. Two racks are used at ≈20 m apart (Figure 3(b)).

Each FSO device has multiple SMs, with each SM aligned during a pre-configuration step to target a point on a ceiling mirror and thus a receiving FSO. The link is established by switching one of the SMs to the mirror state, while leaving the rest in the transparent state.

SMs directly satisfy our design requirements. They can be miniaturized to slightly larger than the beam diameter (1 cm² is sufficient). A SM of this size is expected to have a low cost (< $5) at volume [33] and low power consumption (only 40 mW for the stated size [4]). We have evaluated the reconfiguration time and found it to be within acceptable limits.

### Conclusion

The above design provides a basis for a low-cost, commoditizable, and small-form factor FSO link at high data rates over ranges sufficient for DC scale. Our experiments suggest that the link is robust to realistic (mis)alignment concerns due to environmental effects in DCs. Future work will focus on further optimizing the steering mechanisms and expanding the testing to larger-scale deployments.
