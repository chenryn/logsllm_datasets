Hello.
I'm trying to make my own camera with blackjack and hookers :)  
Doing it mostly by using the source of THREE.FirstPersonCamera and have faced
a problem with updating the scene calling:
    this.supr.update.call( this );
I can't call directly render()-function because it belongs to different scope.
Certainly, i can bind handlers in main-part of the code, but i think, it would
be better to avoid duplicates.  
Code here:
