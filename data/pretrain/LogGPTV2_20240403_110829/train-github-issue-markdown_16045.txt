Our setup is Celery with Redis over Sentinel in a Kubernetes cluster. After
upgrading Redis from version 4.5.4 to 4.5.5 the Celery worker crashed without
any message. Return code after crashing is 0.
The same image running on Docker-Swarm without Sentinel works flawlessly.
pip freeze gives (I removed irrelevant packages):
    billiard==3.6.4.0
    …
    django-redis==5.2.0
    …
    hiredis==2.2.3
    …
    kombu==5.3.0
    …
    redis==4.5.5  # <= the culprit, by downgrading to 4.5.4, Celery works fine
    requests==2.31.0
    …
    urllib3==1.26.16
    …
#8268 seems unrelated, because it has a different message.
