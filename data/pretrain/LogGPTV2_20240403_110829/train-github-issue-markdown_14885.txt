**Error: Mismatched Types**

The error message:
```
error: mismatched types
  expected: `core::option::Option<core::hash::map::HashMap<alloc::arc::Arc<...>>>`,
  found: `core::option::Option<alloc::arc::Arc<...>>`
```

Would be more readable as:
```
error: mismatched types
  expected: `Option<HashMap<Arc<...>>>`,
  found: `Option<Arc<...>>`
```

One possible improvement is to use the type names that are in scope where the type error occurs. In any case, we should ensure that none of the unqualified names in the error message are ambiguous.
