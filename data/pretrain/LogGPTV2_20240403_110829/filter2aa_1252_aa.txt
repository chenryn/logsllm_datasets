AbstractÐTouchscreen-based electronic devices such as smart
phones and smart tablets are widely used in our daily life. While
the security of electronic devices have been heavily investigated
recently, the resilience of touchscreens against various attacks has
yet to be thoroughly investigated. In this paper, for the first time,
we show that touchscreen-based electronic devices are vulnerable
to intentional electromagnetic interference (IEMI) attacks in a
systematic way and how to conduct this attack in a practical
way. Our contribution lies in not just demonstrating the attack,
but also analyzing and quantifying the underlying mechanism
allowing the novel IEMI attack on touchscreens in detail. We
show how to calculate both the minimum amount of electric
field and signal frequency required to induce touchscreen ghost
touches. We further analyze our IEMI attack on real touchscreens
with different magnitudes, frequencies, duration, and multitouch
patterns. The mechanism of controlling the touchscreen-enabled
electronic devices with IEMI signals is also elaborated. We
design and evaluate an out-of-sight touchscreen locator and
touch injection feedback mechanism to assist a practical IEMI
attack. Our attack works directly on the touchscreen circuit
regardless of the touchscreen scanning mechanism or operating
system. Our attack can inject short-tap, long-press, and omni-
directional gestures on touchscreens from a distance larger than
the average thickness of common tabletops. Compared with the
state-of-the-art touchscreen attack, ours can accurately inject
different types of touch events without the need for sensing
signal synchronization, which makes our attack more robust and
practical. In addition, rather than showing a simple proof-of-
concept attack, we present and demonstrate the first ready-to-
use IEMI based touchscreen attack vector with end-to-end attack
scenarios.
I. INTRODUCTION
Consumer electronic devices with touchscreens, such as
smartphones, tablets, and laptops, have become integral parts
of our daily lives because touchscreen technology is both
convenient and intuitive to use. In practice, touchscreens
recognize a touch event by sensing the electric field of the
electrodes under the screen, thereby allowing people to give
commands by performing touch, swipe, and other gestures.
The commands are then converted to electric signals and help
control the systems/apps in the target device. For vehicles

or medical devices incorporating touchscreens, their correct
functionality is tied to user safety.
Among all touchscreen sensing technologies, the capacitive
touchscreen is the most popular because it provides a more
pleasant user experience and is cost effective. A typical
capacitive sensing touchscreen is shown in Fig. 1. There is
an array of electrodes under the cover lens of the touchscreen
with an adhesive layer between the electrodes that provides
mechanical support as well as insulation. The back panel
provides insulation between the electrodes and the liquid
crystal display (LCD) screen. The electrodes, adhesive, and
back panel are made with optically transparent material. The
cover lens is usually made of glass and protects the electrode
and the circuit [1]. When the touchscreen is on, a driver circuit
delivers a voltage between the two layers of electrodes. The
electric field between the two layers of electrodes is constantly
sensed. When a person makes contact with the touchscreen,
the electric field between the electrode layers are disturbed by
their impedance. Touch events are recognized by sensing this
disturbance in the electric field.
Capacitive sensing touchscreens have already been targeted
by several attacks, however, the majority of touchscreen at-
tacks are passive attacks, e.g., inferring keystrokes [2], [3],
[4], [5], [6], revealing the content on the touchscreen [7],
[8], [9], etc. Compared to passive touchscreen attacks, active
attacks [10], [11] that manipulate the touchscreen content
and/or events are rare, uncontrolled, and typically require the
support of a human touch.
In this paper, we present an active touchscreen attack
requiring no physical contact using radiated intentional elec-
tromagnetic interference (IEMI). It is the first radiated IEMI
touchscreen attack capable of stably recreating complex multi-
touch and omni-directonal swipe gestures. Recent work [12]
presents a synchronization-based IEMI touchscreen injection
attack and demonstrates several practical attack scenarios.
However, because of their reliance on synchronization their
range of injected touch events is significantly limited. We
also find, see Section VIII-B and Appendix A, that both
the implementation of synchronization and scanning vary by
device making the attack difficult to generalize. On the other

hand, our attack does not rely on synchronization or the
implementation details of scanning to inject stable short-tap,
long-press, and omni-directional swipe touch events. This is
due in part because we specifically tie the working theory of
capacitive touchscreen technology to radiated IEMI electric
field strength and signal frequency to precisely and reliably
control injected touch events. This in depth analysis allows
fully understanding the characteristics of the IEMI disturbance
interpreted by the touchscreen as a human touch.
The main contributions of the paper are listed as follows.
• We present the underlying mechanism of IEMI based
attacks on modern capacitive touchscreens.
• The principle of IEMI touchscreen attacks is disclosed
both theoretically and empirically. Crucial factors that
influence the effectiveness, including the magnitude, fre-
quency, phase, and duration are elaborated.
• We present an IEMI touchscreen attack capable of inject-
ing both accurate and complex touch events and gestures
such as short-tap, long-press, and omni-directional swipes
mimicking a human touch. 1.
• We demonstrate practical IEMI touchscreen attacks by
designing and implementing an antenna array, screen
locator, and injection detector to bridge the gap between
simple touch event generation and real-world IEMI attack
scenarios. We show and evaluate several practical attacks
using multiple commercial devices under different attack
scenarios.
II. BACKGROUND
In this section, we review background knowledge on the
sensing strategy of capacitive touchscreens with a simplified
touchscreen model.
A. Capacitive Touchscreens
There are two types of capacitive touchscreens which are
widely used [13], self-capacitance touchscreens and mutual
capacitance touchscreens, shown in Fig. 2a and Fig. 2b re-
spectively. The ∆C represents the capacitance change in the
presence of a human finger. When ∆C is sensed, a touch event
is recognized [14].
The self-capacitance touchscreen has a disadvantage be-
cause it cannot recognize diagonal touches. In consumer elec-
tronics, the ability to sense multi-touch events is beneficial. In

contrast, the mutual capacitance touchscreen can sense several
simultaneous touches [13]. Therefore, the mutual capacitance
touchscreen is more popular in consumer electronics [15].
In this paper, we mainly discuss the mutual capacitance
touchscreen although our attack method can also be applied
to the self-capacitance touchscreen without loss of generality.

A typical structure of a mutual capacitance touch screen
system is shown in Fig. 3. The system consists of transmitter
(Tx) and receiver (Rx) electrodes as well as a capacitance to
digital converter (CDC) chip. In the CDC chip, the capacitance
between the electrodes is measured with a charge transfer (QT)
sensor. The circuit topology of a QT sensor with an integrator
is shown in Fig. 4. The QT sensor converts the measured
capacitance to an analog voltage signal that is then converted
to a digital signal by an analog to digital converter (ADC). A
microprocessor will read in and process the converted digital
signal.
Fig. 4: Typical charge transfer circuit topology.
During normal operation, the microprocessor controls three
switches, S1, S2, and S3 (see Fig. 4). Fig. 5 gives an example
of how the control signals are switched periodically. When
the switch S1 is closed, S3 resets Cs and the excitation signal
Vin charges the mutual capacitance CM. During this charging
period, the switches S2 and S3 are open and the voltage Vc
across CM is calculated as follows.
Vc = Vin ·

After CM is charged, S1 is opened and S2 is closed. The
charge stored in CM will be transferred to Cs. Assuming an
ideal op-amp, the current flow through CM and Cs are equal.
The current can be calculated in (2) or (3).

By solving and integrating (2) and (3) simultaneously over the
time with initial conditions, the output voltage Vo is derived
in (4).

Based on (4), the mutual capacitance CM can be calculated
from Vo. When the sensing period is completed, at the begin-
ning of the next period, Cs is discharged by closing S3.
When a touch event occurs, CM is changed by ∆C due to
the presence of a human finger. This change can be either
positive or negative [16] depending on human impedance
variations [17]. The output voltage can be calculated as follows
when the touch event occurs.
VoT = −(CM ± ∆C)

Vc = Vo + VT

A touch event is recognized if the following criterion is met.
|VT | ≥ Vth
(7)
where Vth is the threshold voltage.
The sensing strategy in Fig. 5 senses and compares the
output voltage to every cycle’s threshold voltage. In many
applications, a multi-cycle sensing strategy is usually used to
get a more accurate result for each touch event by measuring
Vo and VT multiple times. In a multi-cycle sensing strategy,
Cs is reset every N cycles. In this way, Vo and VT are the sum
of the voltages in N cycles. The touch recognition criterion
in (7) in this case is as follows.
|
VT | ≥ VthN
(8)
where VthN is the threshold voltage defined for the N cycle
sensing strategy. If the voltage variations in these cycles are
the same, then we have  VT = N · VT .
Based on (1) - (8), the ∆C between every pair of electrodes
can be measured by QT sensors. The locations of the elec-
trodes represent the touchable locations on the touchscreen.

III. THREAT MODEL
In this paper, we assume that the attacker is equipped
with tools that can generate IEMI signals including electrode
plates, a signal generator and an RF power amplifier. The
electrode plates are used to radiate IEMI signals and can be
hidden under a table or desk (check our experimental setup
in Section IX for more details). We further assume that the
victim’s device is equipped with a capacitive touchscreen.
We do not require the victim to have a certain brand of
touchscreen device, nor do we have any limitations on the
operating system. We aim to mimic a real world setting in
which a victim puts their smart device on the table under
which the electrode plates are attached. We assume the victim
puts the smart device face down on the table, a typical way
to prevent screen eavesdropping. The attack does not need to
have prior knowledge of the phone location or orientation.
The attacker can use the electrode plates to generate a precise
touch event on the screen and further manipulate the victim
device to perform security oriented attacks, such as connecting
to Apple headphones to remotely control the victim device, or
installing malicious applications.
IV. IEMI ATTACK PRELIMINARIES
In this section, we will present the fundamental electro-
magnetic concepts and derive the corresponding circuit model
of the touchscreen under the IEMI attack. The concept and
the model here pave the way to systematically analyze the
behavior of a touchscreen under IEMI attacks.
A. IEMI Attack Intuition
From Section II, we learned that a touch event is sensed if
the output voltage variation, VT , is larger than the threshold
voltage, Vth. Therefore, a ghost touch event can be induced
when a radiated IEMI signal causes Vo to exceed the threshold
voltage, which allows attackers to control the device without
physically touching the screen.
B. Generating a Targeted Radiated IEMI Signal
There are multiple ways to generate the radiated IEMI
signal. A simple and straightforward method is to generate
an electric field using two electrode plates that are facing
each other. It is also possible to generate the electric field
with phased antenna arrays where the direction of the IEMI is
controlled by the array factor. The third method is to leverage
directional antennas, such as Log-periodic antennas or Yagi-
Uda [18] antennas.
Based on our attacking principle analysis later in this paper,
electrodes (near-field antenna) are more suitable for existing
smart touchscreen enabled electronic devices, therefore, our
work focuses on an electrode-based IEMI attack and we will
show that only one electrode is enough to perform an attack.
For convenience, we simply call an electrode (a near-field
antenna) as an antenna in later analysis.
C. Effect of Radiated IEMI on a Touchscreen
Fig. 6 depicts the electric field (referred to as E field
hereafter) interference due to an external E field on a touch-
screen, and its effect on the equivalent QT sensor circuit.
The presence of an external E field induces a displacement
current that flows through and adds or removes charge from
the mutual capacitance touchscreen electrodes. Note that Vo of
the QT sensor depends on the total charge stored in the mutual
capacitance CM. Thus, the measured output voltage variation
VT is controlled by the targeted E field and can induce ghost
touches.
