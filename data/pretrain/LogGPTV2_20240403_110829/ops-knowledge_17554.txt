Question: A new diagnostic tool has been developed for an Android device, which requires the use of the `sys_ptrace` capability to trace system processes for debugging. As a security engineer, you are evaluating the tool's compatibility with SELinux 'neverallow' rules. Which of the following is the most appropriate action to take?
"A": "Grant the `sys_ptrace` capability to the diagnostic tool since it is crucial for its functionality.",
"B": "Do not grant the `sys_ptrace` capability as it would violate SELinux `neverallow` rules, indicating the tool should not be present in user-facing builds.",
"C": "Allow the `sys_ptrace` capability only during development builds and remove it for production releases.",
"D": "Modify the SELinux `neverallow` rules to exempt the diagnostic tool from the `sys_ptrace` restriction."
Answer: B
