security, since the code changes every time, it is Resilient-
to-Guessing and Resilient-to-Physical-Observation. To con-
clude, short code provides some usability and security beneﬁts
over most knowledge-based methods—but with the important
caveat that it is not Nothing-to-Carry.
Similar to short code, the QR code method expects the user
to generate a QR code on some other device. Then, the user
scans the QR code with the headset to authenticate. QR code
is comparable to short code in our evaluation except for a
few minor diﬀerences. To use a QR code, the user simply has
to look at the QR code, rather than entering a short code on
the other device; thus, QR code is quasi-Physically-Eﬀortless,
quasi-Accessible-Mobility, and quasi-Accessible-Cognitive. As
before, we stress that QR code is not Nothing-to-Carry.
Physical biometrics (iris scan).
Iris scan is only used for
device authentication on HoloLens 2, but it is important to
consider as the only biometric in our analysis. Unlike the other
incumbent methods, iris scan is only quasi-Mature, since it
is used in practice but not to a large extent. It is also not
Platform-Agnostic though could theoretically become so in the
future since most devices have user-facing cameras.
On the other hand,
iris outshines the other methods in
usability. Since the user does not have to do or remember
anything, it gains every usability beneﬁt and nearly all acces-
sibility beneﬁts (it is only quasi-Accessible-Visual since some
users with visual impairments cannot open their eyes). Iris scan
even does well in the security category, being both Resilient-
to-Guessing (since Microsoft sets very strict requirements on
the accuracy of its biometrics [10]) and Resilient-to-Physical-
Observation. Importantly, iris scan only quasi-Protects-User-
Privacy, since it uses biometric information locally on the
device—this privacy/usability tradeoﬀ is a point of contention
not likely to be solved in the near future.
VI. Evaluating Proposed AR/VR Authentication Mechanisms
Using these incumbent methods as ground truth, we now
systematize recent research eﬀorts in AR and VR authen-
tication. First, we identify prior work which proposes new
AR or VR authentication mechanisms. Then, we evaluate
these newly-proposed authentication mechanisms using the
properties from Section IV.
A. Identifying Prior Work
We collected papers which present new authentication meth-
ods for AR or VR. We queried Google Scholar on March
3, 2021 using the Scholarly Python library [6], running two
queries for each of the 102 top venues we focused on. First,
we searched for papers in that venue containing at least one
of a set of authentication keywords. Then, we searched within
the same venue with a set of keywords related to AR/VR.
Appendix C gives more details about the venues and keywords
we used. We only kept papers in the intersection of these two
searches and published in or after 2010. This yielded 521
potential papers. Of these papers, we were only interested
in those which presented a new authentication mechanism
speciﬁcally for AR or VR. Surprisingly, only fourteen papers
ﬁt this criterion. To ensure we captured all relevant papers,
we then crawled the citations of each of the fourteen papers.
If any citation was published in 2010 or later and presented
a new authentication mechanism speciﬁcally for AR or VR,
we included it in our list. After this second round of paper
collection, we had our ﬁnal list of thirty-eight papers which
present forty-three unique authentication mechanisms in total.
B. Evaluating Proposed Methods
We evaluated the forty-three authentication mechanisms
proposed in prior work. Two authors each evaluated half of
the methods. Then, all authors participated in multiple rounds
of discussion to ensure the evaluation was correct according
to our deﬁnitions of each property (Appendix C).
For each mechanism, we relied on the information given in
the associated paper. Most prior work does not report results
for all evaluation properties; thus, in many cases, we used
our best judgment when evaluating the mechanism. For some
properties, we assumed a default value unless the paper proves
otherwise. In particular, we assumed any method that requires
signal processing does not have Low-Power-Consumption, and
any method with visible actions is not Resilient-to-Physical-
Observation. For Eﬃcient-to-Use and Infrequent-Errors, we
could not make any judgment
in the absence of reported
results. In Fig. 4, † indicates this absence of information.
C. Evaluation Results
We evaluate a variety of proposed authentication methods
for AR and VR. Fig. 4 summarizes our results.
Knowledge-based methods. We evaluated 18 knowledge-
based methods including PINs, obfuscated PINs, and vi-
sual/graphical passwords. Since automatic paired accounts are
an outlier in this category, we compare proposed methods
to the other incumbents: password, manual paired account,
and PIN. Neither these incumbents nor the proposed methods
appear to be the best choice for AR and VR devices.
Deployability. First, the proposed knowledge-based methods
do well in deployability. Some methods—those that essen-
tially re-implement incumbents [33], [77], [63]—achieve all
deployment beneﬁts, including OS-Support. Except for some
3D passwords which do not map to a traditional PIN [77],
[78], [32], [30], all proposed knowledge-based methods are
Platform-Agnostic. This is crucial to allowing developers to
quickly adapt an existing app to an AR or VR context. Further,
most of these methods are Low-Power-Consumption with the
exception of methods that require speech [50], [49], [75], head
movement [50], [49], or input from an external armband [79].
Finally, many proposed knowledge-based methods adapt ex-
isting methods (e.g., a classic PIN) to better suit AR/VR and
are thus Mature or quasi-Mature. These deployability beneﬁts
make knowledge-based methods appealing to developers.
Usability. The cumbersome nature of entering a secret on
AR/VR aﬀects the usability of proposed methods. However,
they occasionally do better than the incumbents. Some are
quasi-Eﬃcient-to-Use, taking three or fewer seconds to au-
thenticate (e.g., [49], [50]); the rest take more than three

seconds to authenticate or do not report latency. Better, Li
et al.’s three methods [50], [49] and George et al.’s PIN [33]
have Infrequent-Errors with around 98% entry accuracy. Three
methods [57], [56], [20], [65] are also quasi-Acceptable-in-
Public, requiring only discreet touch gestures or gaze selection
to enter the secret. Beyond that, proposed methods do not fare
much better than the incumbents. For one property, they do
worse: most proposed methods are not Easy-to-Learn since
they complicate existing methods or are entirely unfamiliar.
Spoken PINs. Two methods [50], [49], [75], attempting
to bypass the usability constraints of AR/VR interactions,
allow a user to enter their PIN by speaking obfuscated digits.
These methods do gain the beneﬁts of being quasi-Physically-
Eﬀortless and quasi-Accessible-Mobility since no physical ac-
tion is required besides speech. However, this comes at the cost
of no longer being Accessible-Hearing or -Speech, and they do
not gain the beneﬁt of being Accessible-Visual since the user
must still read the mapping of obfuscated digits. Additionally,
these methods are no longer Low-Power-Consumption. Though
speech-based methods avoid some pitfalls of other knowledge-
based methods, they do not fare much better overall.
Shoulder surﬁng resilience. One key improvement these
proposed methods oﬀer over incumbent passwords is that
obfuscated PIN methods [75], [50], [49], [79] are Resilient-
to-Physical-Observation. Relatively simple changes like ran-
domizing the layout of digits on the PIN pad can add this
important security beneﬁt while retaining existing beneﬁts.
RubikAuth [57], [56], a method that uses a Rubik’s Cube-style
PIN, is also proven to be Resilient-to-Physical-Observation,
resisting 98.5% of attacks in a user study. In addition, some
proposed methods are more Resilient-to-Guessing than incum-
bents due to larger password spaces; e.g., HoloPass boasts that
user-chosen passwords require 306 billion guesses to crack. In
accordance with these improvements, most methods consider
an external observer in their threat model, and many consider
UI-bound adversaries who attempt to guess the secret.
Summary. Besides automatic paired accounts, incumbent
and proposed knowledge-based methods are on fairly equal
(and unsatisfactory) footing. Promisingly, other methods oﬀer
beneﬁts where knowledge-based methods cannot.
Physical biometrics. Improving upon many of the drawbacks
of knowledge-based methods, physical biometrics achieve far
better usability and accessibility across the board. However,
this comes at the cost of deployability. In our evaluation, the
seven proposed physical biometrics come close to the success
of the incumbent, primarily suﬀering in terms of accuracy.
Deployability. No physical biometric, including iris scan,
has perfect deployability. Zhang et al.’s method [80] is the
only proposed physical biometric proven to be Low-Power-
Consumption (a key metric, since all of the physical biometric
methods require some form of signal processing). On the other
hand, EarEcho [31], which measures the shape of the ear
using sound through an earbud, is the only quasi-Platform-
Agnostic physical biometric; its required earbud could feasibly
be connected to any device. Though physical biometrics oﬀer
usability upgrades from knowledge-based methods, this lack
of deployment beneﬁts may prevent widespread adoption.
Drawbacks. Compared to the incumbent, the key weak-
nesses of proposed physical biometrics are authentication time
and accuracy. Only three proposed methods are Eﬃcient-to-
Use,
taking less than a second to authenticate: Zhang et
al.’s method [80], which measures a user’s eye movement
in response to visual stimuli, along with SkullConduct [70]
and EarEcho [31], which measure the shape of the skull and
ear, respectively. Since the incumbent is nearly instantaneous,
extra seconds matter. Further, for biometric methods, accuracy
impacts not only usability but also security. The accuracy of
these proposed methods is not perfect, and as a result, many
methods do not have Infrequent-Errors and are not Resilient-
to-Guessing. Only ElectricAuth [21] gets full marks in these
two categories. (Notably, ElectricAuth is also not Nothing-
to-Carry or Acceptable-in-Public since it requires an arm-
connected electronic muscle stimulation (EMS) device.)
Summary. Physical biometrics oﬀer strong usability and
accessibility guarantees. However, they lack certain deploy-
ability beneﬁts, and they come at the cost of protecting user
privacy. In theory, physical biometrics can be cancelable and
quasi-Protect-User-Privacy—Brain Password, for example, is
presented as a cancelable biometric since the visual stimuli can
be changed [48]. However, these tradeoﬀs may still impede
physical biometrics from being used in practice.
Behavioral biometrics. Several papers explore the feasibility
of various behavioral biometrics for one-time and continuous
authentication. Though their novelty is exciting, they generally
achieve fewer beneﬁts than physical biometrics.
Required movements. The primary diﬀerence between phys-
ical and behavioral biometrics is that, aside from two zero-
eﬀort methods based on eye and head movement [54], [61],
most behavioral biometrics require active movement from the
user. Two methods [20], [65] require only discreet actions
to interact with Google Glass and are thus quasi-Physically-
Eﬀortless and Acceptable-in-Public. Others require large, but
common actions, like walking [71], [67]; these methods are
not Physically-Eﬀortless, but are quasi-Acceptable-in-Public
(they would be acceptable when the user is already walk-
ing, but not in other situations, e.g., a crowded bus). The
remaining few methods require explicit actions that are not
Physically-Eﬀortless or Acceptable-in-Public, like throwing a
virtual ball [12], [58], [59], [44]. Because of these explicit
actions, behavioral biometrics have fewer accessibility beneﬁts
(most are not Accessible-Visual or Accessible-Mobility), and
crucially, most lose the primary security beneﬁt of physical
biometrics: Resilience-to-Physical-Observation.
Multi-factor methods. While the physical biometrics are
all single-factor, several proposed behavioral biometrics are
Multi-Factor. GlassGuard [65] measures touch and voice be-
havior with Google Glass; others [12], [58], [59] measure
head and hand movements while throwing a ball; and ﬁve
methods [67], [62] combine head, eye, and hand movements
during various activities. In theory, including multiple factors

could substantially improve behavioral biometrics’ resilience
to shoulder surﬁng and guessing attacks. However, as with
the proposed physical biometrics, these methods do not yet
have the accuracy to be Resilient-to-Guessing, and most are
not proven to be shoulder-surﬁng resistant.
Threat models. Most papers proposing biometrics do not
consider an explicit threat model. This is likely because the
focus for most proposed biometrics is making them feasible for
authentication in the ﬁrst place, rather than defending against
an attacker. The behavioral biometric papers that do consider
a threat model mainly consider imitation attacks on the visible
actions required to authenticate.
Physical biometrics vs behavioral biometrics. Biometric
methods perform best
in usability and accessibility while
doing poorly in deployability. Though behavioral biometrics
are exciting and new—and are some of the only methods
to be Multi-Factor—they lose points because they usually
require explicit actions: they are less Accessible (particularly
for mobility and vision), less Physically-Eﬀortless, and less
Acceptable-in-Public than their physical counterparts. Physical
biometrics may therefore be a more promising option for
AR/VR authentication in the long run.
Token-based methods appear only once in literature but
achieve good marks in every category. The only proposed
token-based method is Glass OTP [19], where the user scans
a QR code on a companion Android app to unlock their
Google Glass. Chan et al. evaluate Glass OTP on Bonneau
et al.’s framework [16] (and therefore consider a robust threat
model). By following our deﬁnitions carefully, our evaluation
is slightly diﬀerent than that reported in their paper.
Evaluating Glass OTP. Like the incumbent QR code and
short code, Glass OTP does fairly well in all four categories
of our evaluation. It has worse deployability: it does not have
OS-Support and is not proven to be Low-Power-Consumption.
Chan et al. assert that Glass OTP is not Mature since it
is the ﬁrst OTP method for Google Glass; we evaluate it
as quasi-Mature because it adapts a mature mechanism (QR
code). For usability, the authors report that Glass OTP has
Infrequent-Errors but is not Eﬃcient-to-Use. Since they did
not perform a user study, we abstain from ranking Glass
OTP on these two beneﬁts. Glass OTP is also Memorywise-
Eﬀortless where the incumbents are not since it generates the
QR code using a companion app. In all, token-based methods
provide similar deployability to knowledge-based methods
while oﬀering improved usability, accessibility, and security.
Requirement of a secondary device. Though token-based
methods do well in our evaluation, they have an important
caveat: they are not Nothing-to-Carry. As long as AR and VR
are used only in a select few environments, and generally in
tandem with other devices, this is perfectly acceptable. How-
ever, as soon as these devices are standalone, the requirement
of a secondary device will become a sizeable hurdle. Thus,
we encourage designers to consider other methods that may
be more compatible with the long-term direction of AR/VR.
Multi-factor methods are an intriguing solution. They in-
herit the deployment problems of biometrics and the usabil-
ity/accessibility problems of knowledge-based methods, but
they also achieve some of the highest security beneﬁts in our
evaluation. Multi-factor methods could be a practical way to
add security to authentication on AR and VR.
Characterizing multi-factor methods. There are three multi-
