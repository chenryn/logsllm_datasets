## Feature request
**What is the expected behavior?**  
When handling images with 'asset/resource' using server-side rendering, we do
not want the image file to be emitted, but we do want the image URL to be
populated in the HTML in the server bundle. The client bundle can emit the
image file.
With file-loader one could do this with the emitFile=false flag, but we cannot
do that with Webpack 5 Asset Modules.
'asset/inline' does suppress the output of the image file, but it requires the
image to be inlined, which isn't what is desired.
**What is motivation or use case for adding/changing the behavior?**  
Webpack 5 Asset Modules deprecated the file-loader. But the emitFile feature
of file-loader is not available in Asset Modules. That is a required feature
for Server Side Rendering
**How should this be implemented in your opinion?**  
Include a flag similar to emitFile with 'asset/resource'
**Are you willing to work on this yourself?**  
no
