# Environment
    Windows build number: not relevant
    PowerToys version: not relevant
    PowerToy module for which you are reporting the bug (if applicable): not relevant
# Steps to reproduce
Checkout PowerToys repo into the folder where you have nuget.config file (or
any parent of this folder contains that file).  
Nuget.config file contains:
# Expected behavior
Nuget packages are resolved correctly and the build succeeds.
# Actual behavior
Packages are restored incorrectly and the build fails.  
Nuget restore tries to use defined cache for packages and will add duplicate
references into every project file
