User: I have just installed Python 3.5.1 on my Mac (running the latest version of OSX). My system came with Python 2.7 installed. When I type IDLE at the Terminal prompt my system pulls up the original Python 2.7 rather than the newly installed Python 3.5. How do I get my system to default to Python 3.5.1 when I open the IDLE window from Terminal?
Assistant: If you dont have any python 2 scripts that you use, you can delete python2. But its not a problem to have them both installed. You just have to use another path python3 to launch IDLE. 
I would prefer to let them both installled so if you have any scripts that are in python 2 you can still run them or you have to port them to python3.
