The issue appears to be a compatibility issue between Quartz1.6 JDBCJobStore
and Spring scheduling.
When using a CronTriggerBean to persist a cron trigger a
DataTruncationExceptions is being thrown when attempting to insert the
trigger. The stack trace indicates that Quartz is trying to insert a new
BlobTrigger instead of a CronTrigger.
The issue appears to be a change in how the
org.quartz.impl.jdbcjobstore.StdJDBCDelegate checks to see what type of
trigger is to be inserted. The code for the check in the older(1.5.2) version
is shown below:
[code]  
1166 if (trigger instanceof SimpleTrigger) {  
1167 ps.setString(10, TTYPE_SIMPLE);  
1168 } else if (trigger instanceof CronTrigger) {  
1169 ps.setString(10, TTYPE_CRON);  
1170 } else { // (trigger instanceof BlobTrigger)  
1171 ps.setString(10, TTYPE_BLOB);  
[/code]
In the older implementations of Quartz's
org.quartz.impl.jdbcjobstore.StdJDBCDelegate, it was using an instanceof check
to determine the trigger type. That was fine, since CronTriggerBean subclasses
CronTrigger.
In Quartz version 1.6, the trigger type check is now relying on the getClass
method, shown below:
[code]  
if (trigger.getClass() == SimpleTrigger.class) {  
ps.setString(10, TTYPE_SIMPLE);  
} else if (trigger.getClass() == CronTrigger.class) {  
ps.setString(10, TTYPE_CRON);  
} else {  
ps.setString(10, TTYPE_BLOB);  
}  
[/code]
In this case, the CronTriggerBean (or a SimpleTriggerBean) check is always
going to return false, and Quartz is going to try to insert a BlobTrigger all
the time, causing the data truncation exception.
There are a couple workarounds:  
-Use the Trigger directly as a Bean instead of using CronTriggerBean  
-Manually enter the trigger record to the database  
-swap in the Quartz 1.5.2 jars for the 1.6 jars, start the app and insert the trigger, then go back to 1.6(if desired).
I stumbled across the last one and it is what I have tested so far. The other
workarounds should work, but I haven't tested them.
