Hi all,
I tried to install scikit-learn on my Mac with Lion 10.7.2 (Python 2.7, numpy
1.6.1). At first I tried easy_install and got scikit-0.9 but cannot import due
to some 'Don't forget to 'make' first' error and then I searched online,
finding that this issue should be fixed in the newer version in github. So I
checked out the code and build from source using the following two commands:
python setup.py build  
sudo python setup.py install
Now I've got scikit-0.10 in /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages. However, when I
tried to run the tests, similar error shows up:
Traceback (most recent call last):  
File "", line 1, in  
File "sklearn/ **init**.py", line 30, in  
""" % e)  
ImportError: No module named _check_build

It seems that the scikit-learn has not been built correctly.
If you have installed the scikit-learn from source, please do not forget  
to build the package before using it: run `python setup.py install` or  
`make` in the source directory.
If you have used an installer, please check that it is suited for your  
Python version, your operating system and your platform.
I didn't see errors in my build and build is finished with 'running scons'. I
don't know where I am doing wrong. If you need to know more, please let me
know. Any help would be very appreciated. Thanks!
