Subject: Issue Installing scikit-learn on Mac OS X Lion

Hello,

I am attempting to install scikit-learn on my Mac, which is running OS X Lion 10.7.2, with Python 2.7 and NumPy 1.6.1. Initially, I used `easy_install` to install scikit-learn 0.9, but encountered an import error that suggested I needed to run `make` first. After researching the issue, I found that it should be resolved in the latest version available on GitHub.

I then proceeded to clone the repository and build from source using the following commands:

```bash
python setup.py build
sudo python setup.py install
```

This successfully installed scikit-learn 0.10 in `/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages`. However, when I attempted to run the tests, I encountered a similar error:

```python
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "", line 1, in 
  File "sklearn/__init__.py", line 30, in 
    """ % e)
ImportError: No module named _check_build
```

The error message suggests that scikit-learn was not built correctly. The message also provides the following instructions:

- If you have installed scikit-learn from source, ensure that you run `python setup.py install` or `make` in the source directory.
- If you used an installer, verify that it is compatible with your Python version, operating system, and platform.

I did not encounter any errors during the build process, and the build completed with the message "running scons." I am unsure of what I might be doing wrong. If you need additional information, please let me know. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you,
