User:  How to use Python to write scripts to automate the management of AWS EC2 instances, such as creating and deleting instances in batches, adjusting instance configurations, etc.?
Assistant: To automate the management of AWS EC2 instances using Python, you can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3), which is an official AWS Python SDK. The following are some common operations: 1. Create instances in batches First, we need to create an EC2 client, and then use the run_instances method to create instances. ```python import boto3 ec2 = boto3.client('ec2') response = ec2.run_instances( ImageId='ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0', InstanceType='t2.micro', MinCount=1, MaxCount=5 ) ``` 2 . Delete instances in batches To delete instances, we can use the terminate_instances method: ```python response = ec2.terminate_instances( InstanceIds=['i-0b9bd6c88093cdddd', 'i-0206c2f049f4774bb'] ) ``` 3. Adjust the instance configuration to adjust Instance configuration, we can use modify_instance_attribute method. ```python response = ec2.modify_instance_attribute( InstanceId='i-0b9bd6c88093cdddd', InstanceType={ 'Value': 't2.medium' } ) ``` The above are just a few examples, Boto3 provides many other ways to manage EC2 instances, including creating and managing security groups, elastic block storage (EBS) volumes and snapshots, managing VPCs, and more. By using Boto3 and Python to write scripts, you can easily and quickly automate the management of your AWS EC2 instances.
