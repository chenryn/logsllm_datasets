Abstract. To describe, analyze, and model the topological and structural charac-
teristics of the Internet, researchers use Internet maps constructed at the router or
autonomous system (AS) level. Although progress has been made on each front
individually, a dual graph representing connectivity of routers with AS labels
remains an elusive goal. We take steps toward merging the router-level and AS-
level views of the Internet. We start from a collection of traces, i.e. sequences
of IP addresses obtained with large-scale traceroute measurements from a dis-
tributed set of vantage points. We use state-of-the-art alias resolution techniques
to identify interfaces belonging to the same router. We develop novel heuristics
to assign routers to ASes, producing an AS-router dual graph. We validate our
router assignment heuristics using data provided by tier-1 and tier-2 ISPs and
ﬁve research networks, and show that we successfully assign 80% of routers with
interfaces from multiple ASes to the correct AS. When we include routers with
interfaces from a single AS, the accuracy drops to 71%, due to the 24% of total
inferred routers for which our measurement or alias resolution fails to ﬁnd an in-
terface belonging to the correct AS. We use our dual graph construct to estimate
economic properties of the AS-router dual graph, such as the number of internal
and border routers owned by different types of ASes. We also demonstrate how
our techniques can improve IP-AS mapping, including resolving up to 62% of
false loops we observed in AS paths derived from traceroutes.
1 Introduction
There is growing scientiﬁc interest in the structure and dynamics of Internet topology,
primarily at the router and Autonomous System (AS) levels. Substantial progress over
the last decade toward understanding and improving the integrity and completeness of
router and AS-level topologies separately (reviewed in Section 4) has inspired us to
seek a graph construction that merges router and AS-level views of the Internet. Such
a view would capture administrative boundaries while providing sufﬁcient detail about
the geography and internal structure of each AS. Inherent limitations and inaccuracies
of existing techniques for alias resolution, IP-to-AS mapping, and router-to-AS assign-
ment (not to mention validation of any of them) render this goal challenging.
In this work we take initial steps toward merging router and AS-level views into a
dual graph representation of the Internet. We start from active measurement (traceroute-
like) datasets collected using CAIDA’s Archipelago distributed measurement infrastruc-
ture (Ark) [17]. We then apply state-of-the art alias resolution techniques [19] to infer

which interfaces belong to the same router, creating a router-level Internet map. Finally,
we propose heuristics to assign routers to ASes, using information derived from the
interfaces that we infer belong to a particular router. We evaluate our AS assignment
heuristics by validating against ground truth data from tier-1 and tier-2 ISPs and ﬁve re-
search networks. We successfully assigned 80% of multi-AS routers, i.e, routers whose
interfaces map to different ASes. When we include single-AS routers (routers whose
interfaces all map to the same AS), the accuracy drops to drops to 71%, due to the 24%
of total inferred routers for which our measurement or alias resolution fails to ﬁnd an
interface belonging to the correct AS. We also demonstrate how our techniques can be
used to study the statistical properties of the resulting AS-router dual graph, and can
improve IP-AS mapping of state-of-the-art AS-level traceroute tools.
2 Datasets and Methodology
We brieﬂy describe three components of our methodology: gathering a large set of Inter-
net path data; resolving IP address aliases to create a router-level graph; and designing
heuristics to map annotated routers to ASes. All CAIDA data sets and tools developed
to support this work will be publicly available.
2.1 Datasets
Active Measurements
We collected our active measurements using CAIDA’s Archipelago (Ark) Measurement
infrastructure [17], using 37 monitors in 28 countries. The Ark monitors used Paris
traceroute [6] to randomly probe destinations from each routed /24 seen in BGP dumps
from Routeviews over a 28-day collection period in September and October 2009. We
call the resulting set of 268 million traceroute paths our traceroute dataset, which we
used to infer which IP interfaces belong to the same router (Section 2.2).
BGP Data
To assign IP addresses to ASes, we used publicly available BGP dumps provided
by Routeviews [26] and one of RIPE NCC’s collectors (RCC12) [25]. BGP (Bor-
der Gateway Protocol) is the protocol for exchanging interdomain routing information
among ASes in the Internet. A single origin AS typically announces (“originates”) each
routable preﬁx via BGP. We perform IP-to-AS mapping by assigning an IP address to
the origin AS of the longest matching preﬁx for that IP address. We also used this BGP
data to annotate each interdomain link with one of three (over-simpliﬁed) business re-
lationships: customer-provider (the customer pays the provider); settlement-free peer
(typically no money is exchanged); and sibling (both ASes belong to the same organi-
zation) – using the classiﬁcation algorithm in Dimitropolous et al. [10].
Ground Truth Dataset
Our ground truth datasets includes private data from a tier-1 ISP (ISP1) and a tier-
2 ISP (ISP2). In addition we use public data from the following research networks:
CANET (ISPC)[1], GEANT (ISPG)[2], Internet2 (ISPT )[4], I-Light (ISPL)[3], and Na-
tional LambdaRail (ISPN )[5]. ISP1 and the ﬁve research networks provided the full list

of interfaces. ISP1 and ISP2 provided their hostname conventions, which allowed us to
identify interfaces in their address space, but not on their routers. We thus have two sets
of interfaces for each network i: Ii (interfaces on routers that belong to network i) and
¯Ii (interfaces in i’s address space, but on routers that do not belong to network i). For
each network we then generate a list of AS numbers known to belong to that network:
A1, A2, AC, AI, etc., and the set of ASes that are not in each Ai, denoted ¯Ai.
2.2 Alias Resolution
For alias resolution, we rely on CAIDA’s alias resolution tools MIDAR and kapar [19].
MIDAR expands on the IP velocity techniques of RadarGun [8], and kapar expands
on the analytical techniques of APAR [14]. We ﬁrst use the traceroute dataset as input
to MIDAR, the output of which is fed into kapar. kapar heuristically infers the set of
interfaces that belong to the same router, and the set of two or more routers on the same
“IP link” (which could either be a point-to-point link, or LAN or cloud with multiple
attached IP addresses). kapar produces two datasets corresponding to inferred nodes
(routers) and links. Each node in the router dataset has a set of known interfaces and
inferred interfaces. Known interfaces were measured directly; inferred interfaces result
from kapar determining that a router r1 has a link to interface i2 on router r2, but we
did not see an actual interface on router r1. The interfaces on an IP link are typically
assigned IP addresses from the same preﬁx, so we assume that router r1 must have an
interface from the same preﬁx as i2. The link dataset contains, for each link, the set
of routers and router interfaces that we inferred as sharing that link. kapar correctly
identiﬁed 66% of the true aliases from among the set of ISP1’s observed interfaces (our
largest set of ground truth data), with a 5% false positive rate.
At least three limitations of our alias resolution techniques may affect the AS as-
signment process. First, a large number of interfaces and links between them are never
observed, either because they do not respond to ICMP, or because none of the tracer-
outes encounter those interfaces. Second, some interfaces that respond to ICMP have
addresses belonging to private address space, which makes them indistinguishable from
other interfaces using the same private address space. Third, even when all of a router’s
interfaces are discovered, we may have insufﬁcient information to infer that they belong
to the same router. For example, we inferred 1390 routers as having interfaces from a
single AS in A1, which our method would infer to mean these routers are in ISP1. But
our ground truth dataset refutes this inference; these routers do not belong to ISP1, and
likely have an interface (which we either did not observe or did not resolve accurately)
from at least one other AS in ¯A1.
2.3 AS Assignment Methods
The goal of the AS assignment process is to determine the AS that owns each router. For
each router r, we create an AS frequency matrix that counts the number of interfaces
(known and inferred) from each AS that appears on r. The ASes in this frequency
matrix represent the set of possible owner ASes of r. Next, we describe the heuristics
we designed to determine r’s ownership from among the candidates present in r’s AS
frequency matrix. Figure 1 illustrates the ﬁve heuristics examined in this paper.
