Question: An organization is considering the use of NoSQL databases for their new web application due to the advertised performance and scaling benefits. As a security consultant, you are tasked to explain the potential security trade-offs. Which of the following statements accurately describes a security trade-off when using NoSQL databases as opposed to traditional SQL databases?
"A": "NoSQL databases eliminate the risk of injection attacks completely due to their non-relational nature.",
"B": "NoSQL databases may be more vulnerable to injection attacks as they often execute within a procedural language and lack traditional SQL syntax, thus broadening potential attack vectors.",
"C": "NoSQL databases primarily use HTML special characters for their operations, making them inherently secure against injection attacks.",
"D": "NoSQL databases are less secure because they are unable to utilize XML, JSON, or LINQ for data manipulation, which are known to be secure data formats."
Answer: B
