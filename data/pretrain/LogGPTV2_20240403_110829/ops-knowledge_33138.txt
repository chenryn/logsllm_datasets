Subject: Assistance with Salt Configuration for Zabbix Monitoring Script

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I am currently facing a challenge with automating the configuration of my Zabbix monitoring server using Salt, and I would appreciate your guidance.

I have developed a Bash script that successfully adds a host to my Zabbix monitoring server when executed manually. My goal is to integrate this script into the Salt configuration to automate the process. However, I am encountering an issue where, during a highstate, the state containing the script runs on the master before it does on the minion. This is problematic because the script requires my login authentication, which should be performed on the minion.

### Current Setup:
- **Bash Script**: Successfully adds a host to the Zabbix monitoring server.
- **Salt State**: Configured to run the Bash script.
- **Issue**: The state runs on the master before the minion, causing authentication issues.

### Question:
Is there a specific configuration or best practice for handling such scenarios in Salt? My research suggests that using a `salt-runner` might be a solution, but I am unsure if this is the most appropriate approach.

### Additional Information:
- I need the highstate on the minion to trigger an action on the master.
- I have come across Salt's Reactor, which seems designed for multi-machine interactions, but I am not certain if it is the right tool for this particular use case.

Thank you in advance for your assistance. I look forward to your feedback.

Wishing you a great weekend.
