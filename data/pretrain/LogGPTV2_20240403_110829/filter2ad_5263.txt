Abstract
In this paper, we introduce a novel side-channel attack for eaves-
dropping sound using an electro-optical sensor. We show how
small vibrations of a hanging bulb (in response to sound hitting its
surface), can be exploited by eavesdroppers to recover sound. We
evaluate our method‚Äôs performance in a realistic setup and show
that our method can be used by eavesdroppers to recover songs
from a target room containing the hanging light bulb.

1 Introduction
In recent years, several studies [2, 3, 5, 8] have shown that mea-
surements obtained from motion sensors located in proximity of
a victim can be used for the classification of words. These studies
variously demonstrated that the response of MEMS gyroscopes [5],
and accelerometers [2, 3, 8] to sound can be used to classify words.
Other methods utilized optical sensors to recover sound [4, 6]. The
laser microphone [6] is a well-known method that uses an external
laser transceiver to recover sound by directing a laser beam through
a window into the victim‚Äôs room and analyzing its reflections. In
visual microphone [4], the eavesdropper analyzes the response of
material inside the victim‚Äôs room (e.g., a bag of chips) to sound
waves using video obtained from a high speed video camera (2200
FPS), and recovers speech.

In this paper, we introduce a novel side-channel attack that can
be applied by eavesdroppers to recover sound from a room that
contains a hanging bulb. Our suggested method recovers sound
optically via an electro-optical sensor which is directed at a hang-
ing bulb; such bulbs vibrate due to air pressure fluctuations which
occur naturally when sound waves hit the hanging bulb‚Äôs surface.
We evaluate the performance of our suggested method on the tasks
of recovering songs in a realistic setup. We show that our suggested
method can be used by eavesdroppers songs (which can be accu-
rately identified by Shazam and SoundHound) from a bridge located
25 meters away from the target office containing the hanging bulb.
2 Threat Model
We assume a victim located inside a room/office that contains a
hanging light bulb. We consider an eavesdropper a malicious entity
that is interested in spying on the victim in order to capture the
victim‚Äôs conversations and make use of the information provided
in the conversation (e.g., stealing the victim‚Äôs credit card number,
performing extortion based on private information revealed by the
victim, etc.).
Our method consists of the following primary components:
(1) Telescope - This piece of equipment is used to focus the field
of view on the hanging bulb from a distance.
(2) Electro-optical sensor - This sensor is mounted on the tele-
scope and consists of a photodiode (a semiconductor device)
that converts light into an electrical current. The current is
generated when photons are absorbed in the photodiode.
(3) Sound recovery system - This system receives an optical
signal as input and outputs the recovered acoustic signal. The
eavesdropper can implement such a system with dedicated
hardware (e.g., using capacitors, resistors, etc.). Alternatively,
the attacker can use an ADC to sample the electro-optical
sensor and process the data using a sound recovery algorithm
running on a laptop. In this study, we use the latter digital
approach.
The conversation held in the victim‚Äôs room creates sound ùë†ùëõùëë(ùë°)
that results in fluctuations in the air pressure on the surface of the
hanging bulb. These fluctuations cause the bulb to vibrate, result-
ing in a pattern of displacement over time that the eavesdropper
measures with an optical sensor that is directed at the bulb via a
telescope. The analog output of the electro-optical sensor is sam-
pled by the ADC to a digital optical signal ùëúùëùùë°(ùë°). The attacker
then processes the optical signal ùëúùëùùë°(ùë°), using an audio recovery

contains a hanging E27 LED bulb (12 watt), and Logitech Z533
speakers, which were placed one centimeter from the hanging bulb,
were used to produce the sound that we tried to recover.
The eavesdropper was located on a pedestrian bridge, positioned
an aerial distance of 25 meters from the target office. The experi-
ments described in this section were performed using a telescope
with 35 cm lens diameter. We mounted an electro-optical sensor
(the Thorlabs PDA100A2 [1]) to the telescope. The voltage was sam-
pled from the electro-optical sensor via a 16-bit ADC NI-9223 card
and was processed in LabVIEW script that we wrote. The sound
that was played in the office during the experiments could not be
heard at the eavesdropper‚Äôs location.

algorithm, to an acoustic signal ùë†ùëõùëë‚àó(ùë°). Figure 1 outlines threat
model.
Microphones rely on three components (diaphragm, transducer,
and ADC). In our study, the hanging light bulb is used as a di-
aphragm which captures the sound. The transducer, in which the
vibrations are converted to electricity, consists of the light that is
emitted from the bulb (located in the victim‚Äôs room) and the electro-
optical sensor that creates the associated electricity (located outside
the room at the eavesdropper‚Äôs location). An ADC is used to convert
the electrical signal to a digital signal in a standard microphone
and in our method.
3 Evaluation
In this section, we evaluate the performance of the suggested attack
in terms of its ability to recover sound from a target location when
the eavesdropper is not at the same location.
The target location was an office located on the third floor of
an office building. Curtain walls, which reduce the amount of light
3.1 Recovering a Frequency Scan
We start by examining the effect of the setup on the optical measure-
ments obtained. We note that the setup is very challenging because
of the curtain walls between the telescopes and the hanging bulb.
In the next experiment we evaluated the effect of the curtain walls
on the optical measurements.
Experimental Setup: We played a chirp function (100-1000 Hz)
from the speakers located in the target office and obtained the
optical measurements. We repeated the experiment described above
in another setup in which there is no curtain wall between the bulb
and the telescope, maintaining the same distance between the bulb
and the telescope.
Results: Figure 2 presents the signals recovered from both exper-
iments. As can be seen, the existence of curtain walls decreases the
light captured by the electro-optical sensor dramatically, especially
at high frequencies (above 400 Hz).
3.2 Recovering Songs
Next, we evaluated our method‚Äôs performance in terms of its ability
to recover non-speech audio. In order to do so, we decided to recover
two well-known songs: "Let it Be" by the Beatles and "Clocks" by
Coldplay.
Experimental Setup: We played the beginning of these songs in
the target office where we placed a hanging light bylb. The electro-
optical sensor directed to the light bulb through the telescope and

showing the correct identification made by Shazam are presented

4 Conclusion
In this paper, we introduce a new side-channel attack in which
sound from a room containing a hanging light bulb is recovered ex-
ternally, passively and in real time. More details about this research
can be found in the extended version [7].

obtained measurements while the songs played in the office. We
recovered the songs from the optical measurements.
Results: Figure 3 presents spectrograms of the raw optical signals
obtained from the electro-optical sensor and the audio signals of
"Let it Be" and "Clocks" which we recovered compared to spectro-
grams extracted from the original songs. While the results of the
recovered songs can be seen clearly in the spectrograms, they can be
better appreciated by listening to the recovered songs themselves.1
To further assess the quality of the recovered songs, we decided
to see whether they could be identified by automatic song identifier
applications.
Experimental Setup: We decided to put the recovered signals
to the test using Shazam and SoundHound, the two most popular
applications for identifying songs. We played the recovered songs
("Clocks" and "Let it Be") via the speakers and operated Shazam and
SoundHound from two nearby smartphones.
Results: Shazam and SoundHound were able to accurately iden-
tify both songs. Screenshots that were taken from the smartphone
