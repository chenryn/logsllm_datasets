After the participant chose a suitable image, we logged
how frequently each of the seven images in Figure 3 were
chosen. Comparing the most frequently chosen images to
the results of entropy calculations for each image in Table 2,
we see that the most frequently chosen images were also
those with the highest per-click entropy (Images 4 and 6).
This means that most of the participants in our study chose
the most suitable images, which is encouraging since they
are also likely to make the strongest passwords.
Now, we examine only those images that were considered
suitable by the Stage 1 image saliency measurement in ad-
dressing usability and memorability.
4.3.2 Usability and Memorability
To measure usability, we recorded password creation time
and password recall time. As can be seen in Figure 5, the
highest average creation time was around 28 seconds and
the lowest around 11 seconds. The login and recall times
are lower for most images, with the recall time after one
week quite close to the initial recall (login time) immedi-
ately after creating the password. It is acceptable to have a
longer creation time since creation happens once; it is there-

fore a positive result to see that login and recall times are
somewhat lower, with the one-week recall time similar to the
immediate recall (login) time in most cases. This shows that
the passwords created were relatively easy to enter, which
provides evidence of the ease of password use in our third
question in Section 4. We note, however, that these times
are likely higher than required to enter a textual password,
although this may be due to lack of familiarity and repetition
with our graphical password method. Interestingly, Image
4, the second most suitable image, had a high creation, lo-
gin and recall time compared to other images. However, the
most suitable image, Image 6, had comparatively low cre-
ation, login and recall times. This rather confusing result is
likely due to the speciﬁc image contents.
The time that participants took to login or recall the pass-
words and the number of times that participants needed
to successfully enter their password were measured and as-
sessed with the Kruskal-Wallis test in order to see if there
is any diﬀerence between the images selected. Table 7
indicated that there was no statistically signiﬁcant diﬀer-
ence in terms of login and recall times, nor the number of
times needed to successfully authenticate during initial login
(login-retry), and during the one week recall (recall-retry)
among the seven images. As a result, using the most suit-
able images did not aﬀect login or recall times, and thus does
not have a negative eﬀect on graphical password usability.
Another important feature of usability is user satisfaction
with the proposed scheme. To measure this, we conducted
an interview with participants after the initial creation and
recall phases were complete. Figure 6 shows the responses to
the questions asked as they relate to user satisfaction. The
135
Figure 6: The responses of participants related to
usability of graphical passwords
majority of participants (˜68%) found it easy or very easy
to remember their password, while the participants were
split quite evenly on whether they found graphical pass-
words slow to use when compared to their regular authenti-
cation method. A similar number, slightly more than half,
of participants found graphical passwords easy to use. These
results are somewhat non-deterministic: while participants
found graphical passwords easy to remember, they were also
considered no faster nor easier than traditional methods,
which means that they are about as usable as traditional
methods. While this result shows positive possibilities for
memorability (when combined with the fact that most par-
ticipants needed only one try to recall their password after
one week), it shows little improvement in overall usability.
Therefore, we have shown support for our fourth research
question regarding memorability since less suitable images
showed similar creation and recall times to more suitable im-
ages. However, we also consider this result heartening since
we do not believe the participants considered the graphi-
cal password less usable than traditional methods, and they
were overall less familiar with our method.
4.3.3 User Choice
Finally, to answer question 2 from Section 4 regarding
user choice of RoIs, we created a heatmap (see Figure 7) for
user-selected images to show how frequently each RoI was
chosen. The colors range from green (lightly shaded) for the
least frequently selected regions to yellow and red (darker
shading) as the square is more frequently chosen. If a RoI
was not chosen, or if the region was not considered an RoI
since it did not contain a detected object, the corresponding
square is not colored or shaded. Referring to the heatmap of
Image 4 (Figure 8a), which is one of the two most suitable
images, we see that the center of the circular object was fre-
quently selected (red/darkly shaded square) with a yellow
square just below it. This could be due to participants se-
lecting the center but with less accuracy. Similarly, we see
in the heatmap for Image 8 (Figure 8d) that the two faces in
the image were frequently selected, which corresponds with
previous results that showed that faces were attractive re-
gions [37].
Overall, the heatmaps in Figure 7 show that users tend to
select RoIs relatively evenly, as shown by the preponderance
of green/lightly shaded RoIs on each image. This shows
that, while hotspots do exist in each image, they are not
136
necessarily preferentially chosen by users. This supports our
intuition from Section 3.2.1 that more RoIs may encourage
users to select regions that are not necessarily hotspots, but
that are still visually interesting and potentially memorable.
We chose not to consider non-RoI squares in this assessment
as we believe that if there is no detected RoI that these
selections will not be memorable. We intend to test this
assumption in future work.

5. CONCLUSION
Graphical passwords have become a plausible authenti-
cation approach because of their usability in terms of login
error rate [6]. However, developing a method to evaluate the
predictability of graphical passwords is essential to maintain
the strength at least equal to that of textual passwords. In
this work, we add to the literature on graphical password
strength by proposing a measurement for guiding images
that is based on overall image saliency and contents. Our
measurement can be used to guide suitable image selection
for graphical passwords before the user selects their ﬁrst click
point and without requiring additional user eﬀort, which is
our main contribution. Our main message is that graph-
ical passwords are well suited to the largely touch-based
input common on modern mobile devices, are more mem-
orable than textual passwords, and therefore are likely to
have more scope for future research compared to textual
passwords. Research to discover improvements in graphi-
cal password security, memorability and usability may cre-
ate systems that are better suited to keyboardless or hard
to type on devices, where traditional textual passwords are
unlikely to improve.
We evaluated our saliency measurement model based on
existing graphical password click points, and we found that
the more salient regions on an image, the higher the en-
tropy of click points, and thus the higher the theoretical and
practical password space. We then took the most suitable
images from this evaluation and determined that the resul-
tant passwords will be stronger if a guiding image with more
RoI is chosen. In future work, we would like to broaden the
participant pool to include more diverse users in order to
generalize the results presented here, as well as asking more
in-depth questions regarding user reasoning behind image
choices. We also intend to further support our hypotheses
regarding image saliency and regions of interest with images
other than those used by Zhao et al.
Another important contribution of this work is a challenge
to the belief that hotspots are a detriment to graphical pass-
word guiding images. We show that a more complex image
(i.e., one with more RoIs) can provide more possible click
points that users actually select, thus potentially encourag-
ing the user to create a less guessable password, or at least
one that is more computationally intensive and time con-
suming for an attacker. This has the eﬀect of spreading
potential user click points, and thus potential hotspots, over
an image, which may make dictionary attacks that need to
consider all hotspots less feasible.
Future extensions to this include considering other object
detection algorithms and color features that may provide
additional information about the regions that are likely to be
selected by users. Additional future work will study whether
images with more RoI encourage users to choose more secure
and memorable graphical passwords. This will be explored
with the addition of a graphical password strength meter
based on the strength metric proposed in this work.
