# Kusto.Explorer Installation and User Interface

Kusto.Explorer is a free software tool for Windows desktops that enables you to query and analyze your data using Kusto Query Language (KQL) in a user-friendly interface. This guide will walk you through the installation process and provide an overview of the user interface.

## Key Features
- **Query Your Data**: Execute KQL queries to explore your data.
- **Search Across Tables**: Perform searches across multiple tables.
- **Visualize Data**: Create a wide variety of graphs to visualize your data.
- **Share Queries and Results**: Share your queries and results via email or deep links.

## Installing Kusto.Explorer

### Download and Install
- **Download Link**: [https://aka.ms/ke](https://aka.ms/ke)
- **Alternative Method**: Access your Kusto cluster with a ClickOnce-enabled browser at `https://<your_cluster>/?web=0`. Replace `<your_cluster>` with your cluster URI (e.g., `help.kusto.windows.net`).

### Using Google Chrome
- If Google Chrome is your default browser, install the ClickOnce extension: [ClickOnce for Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/clickonce-for-google-chro/kekahkplibinaibelipdcikofmedafmb/related?hl=en-US)
- For Microsoft Edge, this extension is not required. Validate your ClickOnce settings in [Microsoft Edge flag settings](edge://flags/#edge-click-once).

## Overview of the User Interface

The Kusto.Explorer user interface is designed with a tab and panel layout, similar to other Microsoft products:

- **Menu Panel**: Navigate through various operations.
- **Connections Panel**: Manage your cluster connections.
- **Script Panel**: Create and run scripts.
- **Results Panel**: View the results of your scripts.

## Connections Panel

The Connections panel displays all configured cluster connections, including databases, tables, and their attributes. Select items to set the context for your search/query, or double-click to copy the name to the search/query panel.

- **Search Large Schemas**: Use **CTRL+F** to search for specific entities by entering a substring (case-insensitive).
- **Control from Query Window**: Use commands like `#connect cluster('help').database('Samples')` to connect to a specific cluster/database from your script.

## Work Documents Panel

The Work folders pane organizes your work into two types of folders:

- **Unsaved Work**: Lists open query tabs that you may still be working on.
- **Tracked Folders**: Lists local device folders that can be added as KQL libraries for easier access and management.
