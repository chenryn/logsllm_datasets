sive preference in security. Unfortunately, this means that the time
between a defensive weapon’s creation in comparison to that of its
offensive counter is often huge. Another problem with this defen-
sive preference is that even with the best defensive security proto-
cols and technologies in place, as a social engineer or red teamer,
there is a chance I’ll be able to slip right past them, which is often a
lot easier than getting past a technological defensive protection and
can be just as damaging, maybe more so. Additionally, technology
is becoming further and further intertwined throughout the broad
population’s professional and personal lives, which makes the over-
all goal of security more complex. Because of this, both sides of
technology are needed and both sides of the mindset are needed.
Both offensive and defensive securities have their purpose, and
each is important from a business standpoint. Offensive cyberse-
curity strategies shrink the chance of attacks by promoting a per-
manent state of readiness and actively analyzing the environment;
they can and should be critical in keeping people like me out, which
is a big win when undergoing testing, and the malicious digital
pentesters, too.
Defensive security relies on a comprehensive understanding of
an environment and being able to analyze it in order to detect latent
flaws. The barrier to perpetual, effective defensive security is the
inability to always accurately predict the future.
A like- for- like scenario might be that of an earthquake. In the
United States, we construct buildings meant to withstand earth-
quakes within a range of magnitude, but we can’t always accurately
predict all the other chaos, mayhem, and destruction it might bring
with it. So, after a hurricane strikes, the clean-u p begins and meas-
ures like riverbank management are put in place so that the situa-
tion is not repeated in the future. However, the next earthquake that
strikes might do unforeseen damage to other critical infrastructure.
So, that is then hardened, and the loop continues. As an example,
Hurricane Sandy, when it hit New York in 2012, shone a light on the
inherent flaws of keeping generators in basements. When flooded,
generators are relegated from use. The aftermath of Hurricane
Offensive vs. Defensive Attacker Mindset 19
Sandy also saw the city build more emergency shelters, repair pub-
lic housing to make it more storm-r esistant, and construct flood
protection in the form of greenery around Manhattan. City officials
estimate that the storm cost $19 billion in damages and lost eco-
nomic activity.
Defensive cybersecurity deals with the prevention of attacks
and the strengthening of the defenses that keep them at bay. These
defensive measures often follow a successful offensive attack—
hence the constant lag and uneven playing field. If a metaphorical
hurricane hits a business, they have to quickly address the points of
failure, put in place short-t erm mitigations, and find ways to make
their environment more resilient and less vulnerable to malicious
damage. That reality means it’s imperative for the business to start
preparing immediately to protect its employees, infrastructure, and
revenue from those future catastrophes.
Offensive security mainly refers to penetration testing, for
which a broad definition has been given already, and physical test-
ing, which is a main focus of this book. Threat hunting, which
traditionally is the proactive seeking and destroying of cybersecu-
rity threats before they compromise an organization, may also be
considered as a form of offensive security. For the purposes of this
book, threat hunting is a core component of AMs and, in particular,
the offensive part of the mindset; instead of seeking and destroying
threats to the company, an ethical attacker (EA) will seek out infor-
mation or gaps and turn them into threats. It’s an alternative way of
thinking about threat hunting, and it only applies through the lens
of this book and context. The defensive side intersects here because
it seeks out defenses to first circumvent them and then, after the
attack, to patch and bolster them. Offensive security doesn’t just
build protections and resistance. It sees pervasive penetrations for
what they are—a n active form of asymmetric warfare that threat-
ens security at the highest levels. Offensive security thus aims not
just to defend against threats, but to neutralize them.
With all that said, it seems fair to say that there are advantages
to both sides of security, and that having neither side would result
in mayhem for everyone. Technology has a lot to offer to us all now
20 THE ATTACKER MINDSET
and in the future, but our greatest challenge will always be keeping
it all secure. Even the most cutting- edge techniques and methodol-
ogies of today will have to evolve in the future, and so part of every
business’s (and individual’s) security strategy needs to be devoted to
this task of staying ahead of the curve. Here is where I come to the
point: taking all of this into consideration, there is a solid case for
an EA to have strong offensive and defensive skills from a mental
standpoint. The remainder of this chapter will look at the mental
portion of these categories and how they manifest, as well as their
function as part of a mindset.
The overview I will start with is this: both are needed, and one
cannot exclude the other. The defensive attacker mindset (DAMs)
minimizes how long a mitigating control or interference can
obstruct you from achieving your objective by identifying defenses.
The offensive attacker mindset (OAMs) promotes a permanent
state of readiness, allowing constant analyzation of your environ-
ment and the ability to detect vulnerabilities and impose costs on
those defenses.
The Offensive Attacker Mindset
The offensive attacker mindset (OAMs) allows you as an EA to
direct an event in the direction of the objective. More specifically, it
allows you insights normally invisible to others (namely defense). It
is always scanning for vulnerabilities and creating them from infor-
mation. OAMs is oppositional and unyielding, and it uses informa-
tion and environments only to further your position. It does not
care about anything outside of its focus, which is always the objec-
tive. Typically, your objective as a pentester is access to an asset,
information, or place within a building(s) or on a network.
This mindset uncovers a catalog of valuables and vulnerabili-
ties, and not only those you’ve identified for your own, relatively
narrow objective— it also helps you identify what else the target
deems important in the moment. It will reveal vulnerabilities that
you might not be able to use due to your scope of work or that
Offensive vs. Defensive Attacker Mindset 21
you’ve missed because they do not suit your objective but may still
be a critical or severe vulnerability. For example, if your objective is
to get into the building and to the network operations center (NOC)
without using any other entrances or exits other than the front door,
you should still note if there are opportunities to do so, whether it
be the loading dock or parking structure.
In another example, you may believe due to your scope and
objective that the NOC is the thing the company wants to protect
most. However, upon entering an environment, you may figure out
that actually they are preparing for a market- disrupting move that
executives are meeting for, talking about, and writing about. This
is valuable information—i t doesn’t change your scope or objective,
but it is worth noting in your report or directly to your point of con-
tact (POC).
OAMs is also what keeps you in a sort of hunt mode as the attack
unfolds, identifying any opportunities that present themselves and
exploiting them with seeming ease and poise—a ll without letting
the target know that you have any ulterior motive or missing a beat
as you deviate from your original plan. It leads you to learn new
things about your target and apply those lessons for the good of the
objective. For example, you might not learn until you get on-site
that they have upgraded their visitor system to a digital kiosk that
can be circumvented with the standard out- of- the- box key code.
There is also a sense of competitiveness with OAMs. It doesn’t
want to be beaten. Ever. It doesn’t want to be merciful or helpful.
It wants only to win. Your competitive drive is always influenced
greatly by your determination to set and achieve goals. It should
keep you striving for progress with a quiet but unrelenting focus.
It’s the peak of your curiosity and persistence combined. It is your
competitive desire combined with critical thought that helps you
match and surpass defenses meant to stop you. Your OAMs is
powerful— a force to be reckoned with, neatly hidden behind a
pretext or stealthy moves.
OAMs also guides the achievement of our objective through
certain advantageous vectors. It does so by revealing facilitation
in places you might not have considered looking otherwise, like
22 THE ATTACKER MINDSET
vendors, suppliers, insurance providers, and building maintenance
contractors. It helps you look at the world in an adversarial and
alternative way. It sees through a lens that only identifies helpful or
unhelpful data and information. OAMs wants to proceed and suc-
ceed. It’s the machine that weaponizes information.
Comfort and Risk
My position is this: comfort with risk is one of the most essential
offensive skills. Comfort with risk does not equal discomfort with
caution, however. Too much discomfort with caution will not serve
you in this field.
If you are going out on a mission (say to an armed facility), the
risk is in going; you should remain cautious at every step, but, again,
too much overt caution in the moment will have you stand out. . .a
surefire way to get shot (no pun intended). For the rest of the opera-
tions and engagements you go on, you will need to be comfortable
with risk; too much caution in the moment will equate to too little
confidence, and this may result in you seeming unnatural, which
is the antitheses of your role most often. There are of course times
where you will be nervous; my advice is that, in such moments,
use those nerves as part of your pretext. Let your nervous energy
come out as you tell security that you are running late for a criti-
cal meeting.
This position on caution remains valid no matter the vector you
are using— being too cautious on a vishing call where the target
expects authenticity will likely lower your probability of success.
Being cautious with a phish is a thing—i t will show up in the length
of the email you send. You will likely try to answer every question
you can possibly come up with from the target’s perspective in the
body of your phish— a big no- no. Phishes are to be succinct and
not say quite enough, piquing the target’s curiosity or piquing some
other mood or reaction so that they click on the phish’s link. Too
much caution on a network pen test will likely prevent you from
seeing gaps and exploiting them. You need to be able to take calcu-
lated risks.
Offensive vs. Defensive Attacker Mindset 23
It’s notable that there’s a difference between being comfortable
with risk and failing to analyze a situation, but OAMs has you strike
a balance between the two. The balance can be found in seeking
a solution as a problem comes into view. The slight caution that
OAMs affords you is what aids the swift identification of a problem.
Implementing the solution is a function of comfort with risk. Being
comfortable with risk doesn’t mean you avoid a problem or deny it
exists altogether— it just means that you can be comfortable find-
ing another avenue that isn’t your first choice or that puts you at
greater risk.
The way to reach something that resembles equilibrium between
caution and risk-taking is to apply it with another component of
AMs— visualizing outcomes. By further playing that game of men-
tal chess, you should be able to think through the risk factors of the
operation. Every move you make comes with a risk, and some risks
are the unintended consequences of simply executing an attack.
If you try to think about every single measure of risk involved,
step-by-step, you will walk straight into failure. But keeping your
end goal in mind and thinking through how your next move may
impact how you achieve that goal is a good start. It will keep you
balanced and on track. Keep a holistic assessment of the risk run-
ning in your mind.
To sum up, when executing the attack, you should not be overly
or overtly cautious. There has to be a sense of comfort with risk
when executing. There is, however, lots of room for caution preced-
ing the execution, which, as you’ll see, your DAMs will take care of.
The biggest issue of discomfort with risk when executing an attack
is that it can reveal you as an intruder. OAMs allows you to main-
tain a relaxed approach and to act without showing hesitation and
avoid the dangers of overthinking.
Planning Pressure and Mental Agility
One of your greatest advantages as an EA is that you know you are
attacking, whereas the target is typically oblivious. Often this advan-
tage translates to the illusion of control—t he tendency for all of us
24 THE ATTACKER MINDSET
to overestimate our ability to dominate and manage events. Strictly
speaking, you do not have control over the outcome of any opera-
tion; it’s down to randomness or “luck.” You can do things, however,
to steer the outcome in your favor. The initial reveal here is that
an abundance of caution will hamper this ability to steer, whereas
a relaxed, but risk-a ware, approach will function and perform far
more highly. This may seem difficult given that, as an attacker, you
need to maintain extremely strong offensive mental agility.
You should be focused, intense, aiming to win, and primed to
take advantage of any opportunity for success that real-l ife attacks
provide, also known as mental agility. Note that, even if you plan
an attack within an inch of its life, you will still not be able to accu-
rately account for the actions and reactions of your targets. Without
mental agility, an attacker may be good, but they will never be great.
Planning in and of itself will not lead you to feel pressure, but
insisting you stick to the plan will. It is also likely lead you to failure.
You must be able to interact and react to the environment. No one
wakes up and says to themselves, “Well, today is the day I will not
react to my environment.”
Sometimes we get so set on winning that we get tunnel vision
on the one route we want to take, not the one that’s opening up in
front of us. You must be able to adapt. When nothing is going as
planned, you have to be able to pivot. When everything is going as
planned, you should still recognize the opportunity to pivot, espe-
cially if it leads to a shortcut.
I’ve had to pivot more times than I’ve had hot dinners, and
thankfully, not all have led to success. One of my first jobs saw me
turn up at a small office as an IT consultant, which wasn’t all that
far from the truth. I was promptly introduced to the facilities man-
ager, who was exceptionally nice to me. She gave me a cup of tea,
and I told her about my love of British biscuits because I saw some
in the kitchen, and I am not above hinting. Mere minutes later I had
enough to eat and to take home. News of an IT consultant’s arrival
soon traveled, and not too long after I had staff coming up to me
inquiring about some issues they were having on their computers—
enter the pivot!
Offensive vs. Defensive Attacker Mindset 25
I, of course, agreed to take a look so that I could open a com-
mand prompt—allows you to run programs, manipulate Windows
settings, and access files by typing in commands, the perfect low-
key privilege escalation I’d been looking for. After a few minutes
poking around pretending I knew what I was doing, I opened Ter-
minal and took a discreet photo and thought I’d be on my merry
way— except someone asked me a very simple question that any IT
professional would know, and I crumbled like a two- day- old British
biscuit. They saw me crumble, and minutes later the whole opera-
tion was on its knees because the manager of the office insisted on
calling my cover company, which didn’t exist. All because I couldn’t
recall what RAM stands for. (I can now at all times.) I still man-
aged to pivot. When there was no answer on the other end of the
line, mainly because it was ringing the burner phone in my pocket,
I soon began to act indignant. I left papers to sign and told them
where they could send them and got on my way.
This is the other advantage of OAMs: when you’re under pres-
sure, an offensive edge makes continuing the operation less chal-
lenging. Being able to pivot suddenly to continue trying to achieve
the objective is a specialist skill. Mine let me down only when I
got so flustered by an unexpected question that I couldn’t recall the
words random access memory. But it picked back up when I felt the
heat rise and the possibility of arrest become a real threat.
Using OAMs to combat the pressures of planning and pivot-
ing is, admittedly, easy to comprehend in theory but hard to prac-
tice. Learning this mental skill on the job is among the trickiest
of things to do, but it’s possible. There is definite value in seeking
out stories from people who succeeded in pivoting and from those
who have not.
Ultimately, using OAMs under pressure provides the ability to
develop effective contingency plans, which is a critical mental skill
for frequent decision-making, not only while in an active attack sce-
nario but leading to that time as well. As an aside to this, for some
people it will take time to learn this particular offensive strategy—
working under pressure is on a spectrum, not a case of “you can”
or “you can’t,” so we can all do it to varying degrees. Finding ways
26 THE ATTACKER MINDSET
to build up this skill is tantamount to success as an ethical attacker,
because it’s a constant when you’re out in the field. It may be adding
a little more stress to your current role; it may be building up physi-
cal challenges. The point is that you have to build up your tolerance
from stress and become increasingly immune to its effect on your
critical thinking. For some people, it will seem to come naturally.
Many of the individuals I’ve come across that have found picking
up this skill easy have had seemingly tough initial conditions or
have had experiences that have made using skills like this one sec-
ond nature. It is definitely something you can learn if you aren’t
quite a whiz under pressure yet. Breathing is your greatest tool, as
nuts as that sounds. But checking in on your breathing in moments
of stress isn’t some hippie- dippie technique. It works. It helps you
process what you are feeling, which is most likely what’s prohibit-
