### System Information
- **OpenCV Version:** 4.2.0
- **Operating System/Platform:** Windows 7 64-bit
- **Compiler:** Visual Studio 2017

### Detailed Description
I encountered a memory leak in my C++/MFC/Win32 project when using OpenCV. The issue was detected upon program termination, and I used `windbg.exe` to further investigate the problem.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. **Environment Setup:**
   - Use Visual Studio 2017.
   - Create a C++/MFC/Win32 project.
   - Integrate OpenCV 4.2.0 into the project.

2. **Memory Leak Detection:**
   - Run the program and terminate it.
   - Memory leak detection output:
     ```
     Detected memory leaks!

     ```

3. **Debugging with `windbg.exe`:**
   - For the memory block at address `0x041259A8`:
     ```
     0:000> !heap -p -a 0x041259A8
     address 041259a8 found in
     _HEAP @ 40b0000
     HEAP_ENTRY Size Prev Flags UserPtr UserSize - state
     04125970 000f 0000 [00] 04125988 0005c - (busy)
     ...

     ...
     ```
   - For the memory block at address `0x041233E8`:
     ```
     0:000> !heap -p -a 0x041233E8
     address 041233e8 found in
     _HEAP @ 40b0000

     ...
     5dbf7ed opencv_core420d!cv::SparseMat::ptr+0x00a38123
     ...
     ```

### Problem Analysis
The memory leak appears to be related to the `cv::SparseMat::ptr` function in the OpenCV library. The debug information indicates that these memory blocks are not being properly released.

### Possible Solutions
1. **Check for Proper Deallocation:**
   - Ensure that all dynamically allocated memory is properly deallocated before the program terminates.
   - Review the code where `cv::SparseMat` or other OpenCV objects are used and ensure that they are correctly managed.

2. **Update OpenCV:**
   - Consider updating to a newer version of OpenCV, as the issue might have been fixed in later releases.

3. **Symbol Files:**
   - Obtain and load the correct symbol files for the OpenCV libraries to get more detailed and accurate debugging information.

4. **Use Smart Pointers:**
   - Utilize smart pointers (e.g., `std::unique_ptr`, `std::shared_ptr`) to manage the lifecycle of dynamically allocated objects, which can help prevent memory leaks.

5. **Static Code Analysis:**
   - Use static code analysis tools to detect potential memory leaks and other issues in your code.

By following these steps, you should be able to identify and resolve the memory leak in your project.
