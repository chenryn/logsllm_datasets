  "-_continuousScroll is deprecated for NSScrollWheel. Please use -hasPreciseScrollingDeltas.",  "This log is a deprecation warning for a method called \"_continuousScroll\" in NSScrollWheel, which is a class used to handle scroll wheel events in macOS applications. The log suggests using a new method called \"-hasPreciseScrollingDeltas\" instead. \n\nDeprecation means that the method is outdated and will eventually be removed in future releases. Developers are advised to stop using deprecated methods and adopt new ones to ensure compatibility with upcoming versions of the operating system.\n\nIn this case, \"-hasPreciseScrollingDeltas\" provides more precise scrolling information, giving developers more control over how their applications respond to scrolling events. Therefore, using it instead of \"_continuousScroll\" can improve the user experience and make the application more responsive to user input."

  "-deviceDeltaY is deprecated for NSScrollWheel. Please use -scrollingDeltaY.",  "This log message is informing the user or programmer that the use of the \"deviceDeltaY\" method for the NSScrollWheel class is no longer supported and has been replaced by the \"scrollingDeltaY\" method. This indicates that the code using \"deviceDeltaY\" needs to be updated to use \"scrollingDeltaY\" instead. The reason for deprecation could be due to better performance or accuracy offered by the new method, or the old method could have been expensive or troublesome to maintain. Programmers should update their code to avoid relying on deprecated methods, as they may be removed in future releases and cause unexpected behavior in the application. Overall, this log message is a warning to developers to update their code to ensure compatibility with future releases."

  "Wake reason: EC.SleepTimer (SleepTimer)",  "As an engineer in the maintenance and operation domain, I can explain that the log you are seeing indicates that the device in question woke up due to the \"EC.SleepTimer\". This refers to an internal mechanism in the device called the \"Embedded Controller (EC)\", which is responsible for managing battery, power, and other low-level system functions. \n\nThe SleepTimer is a specific feature of the EC that allows the device to go into a low-power sleep mode for a specific period of time, after which it will wake up again. The reason for this wake-up may vary depending on the device's configuration and usage. For instance, a device might use the SleepTimer to conserve battery life during periods of inactivity, or to schedule certain tasks at specific times.\n\nIn any case, the Wake reason log simply indicates that the device was in a low-power sleep mode for a specific period of time, and was awakened by the SleepTimer feature of the EC. This is a normal and expected behavior for many modern devices, and should not be a cause for concern unless it is accompanied by other error messages or performance issues."
