Learned Tips and Tricks
 This is an attempt to share all of the weird
tips and tricks we tried and tested.
 Your mileage may very, feel free to shout
out what works for you.
  Please, no “heard this works” – First
hand knowledge only!
Data Recovery
 CD / DVD with damaged media, use CD
labels to keep foil from coming up.
 CD / DVD, we used metallic silver spray
paint when we had broken foil with some
success.
 HD / CD / DVD, try different drives and
OS.  You would be amazed that it works
without issue on another OS.
Data Recovery
 CD/DVD writers are much better at reading
damaged media.  We like:
 CDs, early Lite-on and Plexstor preferred by
CDFreaks and data recovery pros.
 DVD, Plextor 12x and Pioneer 12x (ebay).
 Cleaning your media
 Try it first, don’t do anything unless it fails.
 Isopropyl alcohol.
 Ivory soap and water.
Data Recovery
 Lots of recovery software exists, but we
found that if none work if you get “Media
Not Found”
 Lots of software exists:
Bad Copy pro, ISOBuster, AD Imager,
DVDisaster, dd, dd_rescue, Ontrack, …
Team was split, ISOBuster, AccessData FTK
& Imager, and BadCopy Pro.
