### Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Document Search Techniques

#### Introduction to AWS
Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a comprehensive cloud computing platform that provides storage and hosting for internet applications. Instead of purchasing expensive hardware, many companies and individuals opt to rent these servers. These servers host a wide range of documents, databases, and data sets, making them a valuable resource for various types of data.

#### The Value of Searching AWS Servers
The importance of searching AWS servers cannot be overstated. During the 2016 U.S. election, much of the voter data discussed was sourced from AWS. I have personally discovered highly sensitive documents through this method on multiple occasions.

#### Searching for Documents on AWS
- **Google Custom Searches:** Custom Google searches can locate some of the content hosted on AWS, but they do not provide a full index of all available data.
- **Gray Hat Warfare:** This service offers a searchable database of over one billion files, all publicly stored on AWS servers. Free users have access to the first 350 million files. For example, a search for "OSINT" yields 11 results, while "password" returns over 41,000 results. These results often include large files that must be opened carefully. A search for "password xls" provided three documents with active credentials.

#### Amazon CloudFront
- **CloudFront Overview:** CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) offered by AWS. It provides a globally-distributed network of proxy servers that cache content, such as web videos or other large media files, to improve access speed for end-users.
- **Search Techniques:** You can apply the same search techniques used for AWS on CloudFront. For example, a Google search for "OSINT" on CloudFront domains yielded 129 results.

#### Example Search Queries
- **Presentation Repositories:**
  - `site:prezi.com "osint"`
  - `site:scribd.com "osint"`
  - `https://www.pdfdrive.com/search?q=osint`

- **Google Drive:**
  - `site:storage.googleapis.com ext:xlsx OR ext:xlxs` - 2,310 Spreadsheets
  - `site:storage.googleapis.com "confidential"` - 9,502 Documents
  - `site:storage.googleapis.com "confidential" ext:pptx` - 11 PowerPoint files marked as confidential

- **SlideShare and ISSUU:**
  - `site:slideshare.net "osint"`
  - `site:issuu.com "osint"`

#### Document Metadata
- **Metadata Importance:** Analyzing metadata can provide valuable information about the document's origin, including the computer name, username, software version, and network details.
- **Metadata Tools:**
  - **ExifTool:** A terminal-based tool installed in your custom Linux virtual machine.
  - **Online Metadata Viewers:**
    - `exiftool.org`
    - `extractmetadata.com`
    - `exif.regex.info/exif.cgi`
    - `exifinfo.org`
    - `get-metadata.com`

- **Cautionary Note:** Be cautious when uploading documents to online services, especially if they contain sensitive or classified information. Use local tools like ExifTool for such cases.

#### Example Analysis
- **Google Search:**
  - `ext:docx "osint"`

- **FOCA (File Operations and Content Analysis):**
  - Open FOCA and click the Metadata folder in the left menu.
  - Drag and drop the documents into the FOCA window.
  - Right-click any of the documents and choose "Extract all metadata".
  - Right-click any of the documents and choose "Analyze metadata".

- **Command Line Example:**
  - `cd ~/Desktop/Evidence`
  - `exiftool * -csv > ~/Desktop/Evidence/Report.csv`

#### Conclusion
By leveraging the right tools and techniques, you can effectively search and analyze documents hosted on AWS and other cloud services. Always exercise caution when handling sensitive information and use local tools when necessary to protect your data.
