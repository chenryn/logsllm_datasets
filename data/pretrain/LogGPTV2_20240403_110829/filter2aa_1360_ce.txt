Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a large collection of servers that supply storage and internet application hosting 
in "the cloud". Instead of purchasing expensive hardware, many companies and individuals rent these servers. 
There are numerous documents available for download from these servers when searched appropriately. I 
cannot overstate the value of searching Amazon's servers. This is where most of the voter data that was heavily 
discussed during the 2016 election originated. I have personally located extremely sensitive documents from this 
source on numerous occasions. The following structure will identify files indexed on google.com.
AWS hosts more than simple documents. Many companies host large databases and data sets within "buckets 
on AWS servers. Custom Google searches may locate some of this content, but never a full index of all data. 
This is where Gray Hat Warfare excels. It has created a searchable database of over one billion files, all publicly 
stored with AWS servers. Free users are limited to the first 350 million of these files, which is substantial. A 
search of "OSINT" revealed only 11 results while "password" displayed over 41,000. The results are often large 
files which must be opened carefully. A search of "password xls" provided three documents with active 
credentials. A direct search URL is as follows.
Another option is the Amazon CloudFront servers. CloudFront is a content deliver}’ network (CDN) offered 
by Amazon Web Services. Content delivery networks provide a globally-distributed network of proxy servers 
which cache content, such as web videos or other bulky media. These are provided more locally to consumers, 
thus improving access speed for downloading the content. We can apply the same previous search techniques 
on this domain. The following search on Google yielded 129 results of pages on various CloudFront servers 
containing the acronym "OSINT".
The following search examples will explain a couple of the options. The exact search is listed with the expected 
result. These should be used as a starting point for the many possibilities of document searching.

This service scans the internet for new PDF files and archives them. This can be helpful when the original source 
removes the content. The following static URL conducts a query across the entire domain.

site:storage.googleapis.com "confidential" - 9,502 Documents
site:storage.googleapis.com "confidential" exttpptx - 11 PowerPoint files marked as confidential
Slide Share and ISSUU allow native searching within their websites. However, Prezi does not have this option. 
For all, I recommend a custom Google search with the site operator. If I want to locate presentations including 
the term OSINT from Prezi, I would use the following query.
Most of these documents are intentionally stored on the site and any evidence of criminal activity will not be 
included. Instead, the primary use of the site for OSINT investigations is the large number of documents related 
to businesses. Entering any large corporation name should display several pages of viewable documents related 
to the company. Often, these include documents that the company's security personnel would not authorize to 
be online. Searching for "FOUO", an acronym for "for official use only", produced hundreds of results. While 
none of these appeared to be officially classified, they were not intended to be posted to a public website. If you 
are presented with an unmanageable number of results, the filter opdons appear directly above the first 
document result These will allow you to search by language, size, file type, and date uploaded.
With unprecedented online storage space at all of our fingertips, many people choose to store PowerPoint and 
other types of presentations in the cloud. Several free sendees have appeared to fill this demand. Of those, the 
folloxring have the majority of publicly available documents.
Scribd was a leading cloud storage document sendee for several years. Since 2014, it has shifted its focus toward 
e-book sales. However, the plethora of stored documents is still accessible. This can be valuable for historical 
content posted, and likely forgotten, by the target A search field is at the top of every page on the site within 
their collapsible menu. Searching for your target name should produce any public books stored through this 
sendee that includes the target name on any page of the publication. Clicking "Documents" in the menu will 
present more relevant information.
Identifying the user that uploaded a document is as easy as locating the document. In the upper-center of any 
page containing a document, there is an area that will identify the subject that uploaded the file. This also acts 
as a link to this user's profile on the website. The profile will display any information that the user supplied as 
well as a feed of recent activity of that user on the site. This can help identify other documents uploaded by a 
specific user.

Another site that strives to release sensitive and classified information to the public is Cryptome. Most of the 
information is related to freedom of speech, cryptography, spying, and surveillance. Much of the content could 
be considered conspiracy' theories, but several official documents get released daily. Crjptome does not provide 
a search for their site and there are no third-party providers that cater to this service. Therefore, we must rely 
on Google or Bing to find the documents. A structured query of "osint" should function well. This technique 
using the search terms of "bradlcy manning" linked to 77 documents surrounding his investigation.
Pastebin is the most popular paste site in the United States. Criminal hacker groups often use this site to release 
illegally' obtained data to the public. A previous release included the home addresses and personal information 
of many' police officers near Ferguson, Missouri during protests and riots. More recently, stolen bank records 
and credentials from Venezuela were posted with encouragement to infiltrate the company. This is one of the 
sites that will allow for a search from within the site. This function performs a search through Google in the 
same wav we could with the "site" operator. Typing in a target name, email address, or business name may’ reveal 
private information not intended for the public. For law enforcement, typing in the last four digits of a stolen 
credit card number may' identify’ a link to the thief. If successful, the target is most likely’ outside of the country’. 
Regardless, this is a valuable piece to the case and an impressive explanation to the victim. Unfortunately, most 
of the users leave a default username of "Guest". Pastebin no longer allows a direct URL search, but relies on 
Google for indexing, as follows.
Some websites are created for the sole purpose of leaking sensitive and classified documents to the public. 
Wikileaks is such a site. When an Army' soldier named Bradley Manning was arrested in 2010 for uploading 
classified government information to the site, Wikileaks became a household name. People then began to flock 
to the site to catch a glimpse of these controversial documents and videos. The official Wikileaks site finally 
provides a working search option. It will allow you to enter any search terms and will provide results of any 
leaked documents that contain these terms. Both the government and the private sector should be familiar with 
this site and the information that is identified with their respective agency.
New paste sites come and go monthly. There is no way to present a current and complete list. However, 1 xvill 
focus on the most stable and prominent options which allow search. In a moment, I present a custom search 
tool which queries all of these at once. The following sites can be individually queried with the site operator, 
such as site:doxbin.org "osint".
Paste Sites are not technically storage sendees for documents. They are websites that allow users to upload text 
for public viewing. These were originally designed for software programmers that needed a place to store large 
amounts of text. A link would be created to the text and the user could share the link with other programmers 
to review the code. This is still a common practice, but other users have found ways to abuse this technology’. 
Many hacking groups will use this area of the internet to store compromised account information, user 
passwords, credit card numbers, and other sensitive content. There are dozens of sites that cater to this need, 
and very' few of them have a search feature.

You already possess a document metadata viewer within your custom Linux virtual machine. It is called ExifTool 
and we installed it during the previous chapters. This is a terminal-based solution, but the function is quite
If I need to analyze the metadata stored within documents, I prefer to do so locally on my machine. I do not 
want to share any potential investigation details with an online resource. This is especially true if the documents 
are not already online. You may possess a folder of files which were retrieved from a suspect computer or 
emailed directly to you. In these scenarios, we should be cautious as to not distribute any7 evidence electronically 
to any websites. I present two solutions, with a third unstable option.
When an original document is found online, it is obviously important to analyze the visible content of the file. 
This includes the file name, written text, and an original location of the document. Digging deeper will expose 
more information. There is data embedded inside the document that cannot be seen by simply looking at the 
content of the file. This data is called metadata and can be very7 valuable to any7 type of investigation. It can often 
include the computer name on which the document was created, the username of the computer or the network, 
the software version used, and information about the network to which the computer is connected. The best 
way7 to view all of this information is to use software-based metadata viewers, but you can also view this "hidden” 
information online through a web browser.
Several online sites will allow you to upload documents for analysis. To do this, click the "browse" button on 
the pages detailed below. This will enable a file explorer that will allow you to select the document that you want 
analyzed. The result often identifies a created and modified date, the original tide, three applications used to 
create the document, and a username. A further search of this username through the previously discussed 
techniques could produce a wealth of information about the author of the document. The following websites 
allow you to upload a locally7 stored document or submit a URL of a file for analysis. Please use caution with 
this technique. If the document is already7 posted online, there is very7 litde risk of allowing a URL analysis. 
However, a locally7 stored file that has never been on the internet may7 require a second thought. If the content 
is sensitive, you may not want to upload to any sendee. If the file contains classified information, you could be 
jeopardizing your clearance. In these situations, use the methods discussed in a moment. If this is not a concern 
the following websites work well.
