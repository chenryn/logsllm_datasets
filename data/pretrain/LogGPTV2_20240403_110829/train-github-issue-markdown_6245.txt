Hello,

I have a DataFrame with a MultiIndex, where the index levels are as follows:
```python
stats.index.names
Out[67]: FrozenList([u'day', u'category'])
```
- `day` is a time variable.
- `category` is a string.

The inferred type and data type of the index are:
```python
stats.index.inferred_type
Out[69]: 'mixed'

stats.index.dtype_str
Out[68]: 'object'
```

When I use the following code to slice the DataFrame for a specific date:
```python
idx = pd.IndexSlice
stats.loc[idx['2015-01-01', :], :]
```
I correctly get all the observations for all categories on that day.

However, when I try to slice the DataFrame for a specific year:
```python
idx = pd.IndexSlice
stats.loc[idx['2015', :], :]
```
I receive almost all my observations, including those from years other than 2015.

What could be causing this issue? Unfortunately, I cannot share the actual data, but I am happy to provide any additional information or context to help resolve this problem.

Thank you.
