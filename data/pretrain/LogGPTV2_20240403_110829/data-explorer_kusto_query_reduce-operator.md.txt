# reduce operator
Groups a set of strings together based on value similarity.
For each such group, the operator returns a `pattern`, `count`, and `representative`. The `pattern` best describes the group, in which the `*` character represents a wildcard. The `count` is the number of values in the group, and the `representative` is one of the original values in the group.
## Syntax
*T* `|` `reduce` [`kind` `=` *ReduceKind*] `by` *Expr* [`with` [`threshold` `=` *Threshold*] [`,` `characters` `=` *Characters*]]
[!INCLUDE [syntax-conventions-note](../../includes/syntax-conventions-note.md)]
## Parameters
| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|--|--|--|--|
| *Expr* | `string` |  :heavy_check_mark: | The value by which to reduce.|
| *Threshold* | `real` | | A value between 0 and 1 that determines the minimum fraction of rows required to match the grouping criteria in order to trigger a reduction operation. The default value is 0.1.We recommend setting a small threshold value for large inputs. With a smaller threshold value, more similar values are grouped together, resulting in fewer but more similar groups. A larger threshold value requires less similarity, resulting in more groups that are less similar. See [Examples](#examples).|
| *Characters* | `string` | | A list of characters that separate between terms. The default is every non-ascii numeric character. For examples, see [Behavior of Characters parameter](#behavior-of-characters-parameter).|
| *ReduceKind* | `string` | | The only valid value is `source`. If `source` is specified, the operator appends the `Pattern` column to the existing rows in the table instead of aggregating by `Pattern`.|
## Returns
A table with as many rows as there are groups and columns titled `pattern`, `count`, and `representative`. The `pattern` best describes the group, in which the `*` character represents a wildcard, or placeholder for an arbitrary insertion string. The `count` is the number of values in the group, and the `representative` is one of the original values in the group.
For example, the result of `reduce by city` might include:
|Pattern     |Count |Representative|
|------------|------|--------------|
| San *      | 5182 |San Bernard   |
| Saint *    | 2846 |Saint Lucy    |
| Moscow     | 3726 |Moscow        |
| \* -on- \* | 2730 |One -on- One  |
| Paris      | 2716 |Paris         |
## Examples
### Small threshold value
> [!div class="nextstepaction"]
> Run the query
```kusto
range x from 1 to 1000 step 1
| project MyText = strcat("MachineLearningX", tostring(toint(rand(10))))
| reduce by MyText  with threshold=0.001 , characters = "X" 
```
**Output**
|Pattern         |Count|Representative   |
|----------------|-----|-----------------|
|MachineLearning*|1000 |MachineLearningX4|
### Large threshold value
> [!div class="nextstepaction"]
> Run the query
```kusto
range x from 1 to 1000 step 1
| project MyText = strcat("MachineLearningX", tostring(toint(rand(10))))
| reduce by MyText  with threshold=0.9 , characters = "X" 
```
**Output**
|Pattern         |Count|Representative   |
|----------------|-----|-----------------|
|MachineLearning*|177|MachineLearningX9|
|MachineLearning*|102|MachineLearningX0|
|MachineLearning*|106|MachineLearningX1|
|MachineLearning*|96|MachineLearningX6|
|MachineLearning*|110|MachineLearningX4|
|MachineLearning*|100|MachineLearningX3|
|MachineLearning*|99|MachineLearningX8|
|MachineLearning*|104|MachineLearningX7|
|MachineLearning*|106|MachineLearningX2|
### Behavior of Characters parameter
If the *Characters* parameter is unspecified, then every non-ascii numeric character becomes a term separator.
> [!div class="nextstepaction"]
> Run the query
```kusto
range x from 1 to 10 step 1 | project str = strcat("foo", "Z", tostring(x)) | reduce by str
```
**Output**
|Pattern|Count|Representative|
|--|--|--|
|others|10||
However, if you specify that "Z" is a separator, then it's as if each value in `str` is 2 terms: `foo` and `tostring(x)`:
> [!div class="nextstepaction"]
> Run the query
```kusto
range x from 1 to 10 step 1 | project str = strcat("foo", "Z", tostring(x)) | reduce by str with characters="Z"
```
**Output**
|Pattern|Count|Representative|
|--|--|--|
|foo*|10|fooZ1|
### Apply `reduce` to sanitized input
The following example shows how one might apply the `reduce` operator to a "sanitized"
input, in which GUIDs in the column being reduced are replaced prior to reducing
```kusto
// Start with a few records from the Trace table.
Trace | take 10000
// We will reduce the Text column which includes random GUIDs.
// As random GUIDs interfere with the reduce operation, replace them all
// by the string "GUID".
| extend Text=replace_regex(Text, @"[[:xdigit:]]{8}-[[:xdigit:]]{4}-[[:xdigit:]]{4}-[[:xdigit:]]{4}-[[:xdigit:]]{12}", @"GUID")
// Now perform the reduce. In case there are other "quasi-random" identifiers with embedded '-'
// or '_' characters in them, treat these as non-term-breakers.
| reduce by Text with characters="-_"
```
