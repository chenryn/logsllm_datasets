User: I'd like to deploy Python to non-programmers in my organization such that the  install process consists entirely of syncing a directory from Perforce and maybe running one batch file that sets up environment variables.
Is it possible to package up Miniconda in such a way it can be "installed" just by copying down a directory?   What does its installer do?
The reason for this is that I'd like to automate certain tasks for our artists by providing them with Python scripts they can run from the commandline. But I need to get the interpreter onto their machines without having to run any kind of installer or uninstaller, or any process that can fail in a non-idempotent way. A batch file that sets up env vars is fine, because it is idempotent. An installer that can fail partway through and put the workstation into a state requiring intervention to fix is not. 
In particular, adding a library to everyone's install should consist of my using conda on my desk, checking the ensuing directory into P4, and then letting artists pick it up automatically with their next p4 sync.
I looked at WinPython, but at 1.4GB it is too large. Portable Python is defunct.
We are exclusively a Windows shop, so do not need Linux- or Mac-portable solutions.
Assistant: Since you mentioned WinPython as an option, but said you dismissed it for being 'too large':
WinPython now includes a 'Zero' version with each release that has nearly all of the bloat removed (equivalent to the relationship between Miniconda and Anaconda). I believe the folder containing the WinPython-64bit v3.6.3.0Zero release clocked in around 50-100MB.
