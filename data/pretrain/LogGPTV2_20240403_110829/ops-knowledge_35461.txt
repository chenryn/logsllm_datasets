User: I've been browsing documentation, but haven't been able to find a straightforward tutorial, so I apologize if this is a really simple question.
Anyway, I have eclipse with pydev installed on MAC OSX, and I want configure wxPython to work with eclipse, how do I do this? Once I've downloaded wxpython, what steps do I take to allow wxPython development from eclipse?
Thanks!
Assistant: Vinay's answer above is correct.  However, if code completion is not picking it up, you might need to add the WX directory to the Pydev's interpreter library path.

Window | Preferences | Pydev |
  Interpreter - Python | Libraries

If wx is not present, New Folder and select the install directory.
