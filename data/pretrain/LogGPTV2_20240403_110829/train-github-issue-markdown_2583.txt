I find this a bit annoying, because I'm used to use the exponent notation to
declare large numbers. Of course I could do zeros(10^4) but I think it should
also work with 1e4.
The problem is that 1e4 is a float and 10^4 an int, and that Array doesn't
accept floats for dimensional arguments.
Is there any problems with trying to convert floats to int when declaring
arrays ? I think it would simplify things quite a bit, and it seems safe to
me, since convert will give an InexactError when trying to declare an array
with 10.5 elements.
It would also solve this kind of weird behavior:
    julia> zeros(100/10)
    ERROR: no method Array(DataType,Float64)
     in zeros at array.jl:205
