Fig. 9: Results from Case Study 2. (a) M T BF and (b) M T T R error, (b) truncations and (e) collisions in the considered coalescence
techniques against the scale of the system; sensitivity analysis of (c) collision and (f) truncation errors for different workloads.
this aim, we repeated the experiments of the 8192 nodes case
with i) a light CPU bound workload, ii) a light IO bound
workload with failure propagation, iii) a stressful workload
(IO bound and CPU bound jobs), and iv) a stressful workload
with failure propagation. For the collisions, we can observe
a similar trend for all algorithms, that is, more collisions are
caused as the complexity of the workload increases. However,
this result cannot be generalized for truncations, which are
more dependent on the algorithm and on the speciÔ¨Åc failure
process. For instance, we can note an increasing error for
optimally tuned algorithms (sliding opt, Ô¨Åxed opt, SC07), but a
completely workload dependent trend for the algorithms tuned
with the knee rule, which again seems to perform better as the
complexity of the system increases.
Figure 10 reports the results of the sensitivity analysis for
the sliding algorithm, repeated for case study 2 for 8192 nodes.
Interestingly, also in the case of more complex logs, generated
with several different failure inter-arrival distributions, and
considering failure propagations and a stressful workload, we
can see the same trends observed for the simplistic case.
Again, the time window W corresponding to the crossing point
between collision and truncation curves (200 in the Ô¨Ågure) is
the one where M T BFerr is 0. However, in this case we can
notice from the tuple count curve (Figure 10.(a)) that only one
knee is visible, not corresponding to the optimal window: this
is due to the presence of several overlapping dynamics, which
are not distinguishable as in the previous case. This suggests
that the knee rule is useful but it is difÔ¨Åcult to apply in the case
of complex and overlapping system dynamics, which should be
isolated and treated separately.
VI. LESSONS LEARNED
In this work, we proposed a novel approach and related
tools to assess and validate time coalescence techniques when
applied to supercomputers event logs. Experiments conducted
with the proposed approach on four different coalescence
techniques, and on different system conÔ¨Ågurations, revealed
the following interesting Ô¨Åndings.
‚Ä¢ The MTBF error is strictly correlated with truncations
and collisions;
in particular the MTBF error is null
in correspondence of a time window value such that
the percentage of collisions equals the percentage of
truncations. Coalescence techniques able to estimate the
probability of truncations and collisions would in turn
allow to deÔ¨Åne novel criteria to tune the time window,
able to minimize the error on MTBF measurements.
‚Ä¢ The statistical properties of the reconstructed time to
failure distributions may be not preserved, even when
optimal value for parameters are selected. The awareness
of these issues, and the possibility to assess their impact
on a given system, allow to estimate the expected error
on measurements, which is useful to correctly interpret
and weight the results.
‚Ä¢ When the system increases in size and complexity, the
presence of several overlapping dynamics can compro-
mise the practical application of classical time coales-
cence techniques, which need to the rethought. A possible
solution could be to isolate the different dynamics of the
system (e.g., by isolating log entries related to different
subsystems) and treat them separately.
We believe our approach and tools to be of interest for
researchers and practitioners active in the design and devel-
opment of log analysis techniques. The approach represents a
valid means to validate design choices, to identify issues, and
to quantitatively assess novel solutions.
Future efforts will be devoted to the extension of the
approach with further mechanisms enabling the generation
of informational and debug log entries and the production
of realistic messages and message patterns, extracted from
real systems. This will allow to extend the framework to the
assessment of content-based coalescence techniques.
