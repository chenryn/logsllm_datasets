User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Setting Low Disk Space Alerts on Windows Server 2008 I was wondering if there is an easy way to trigger an e-mail alert on Windows Server 2008 when any logical disk partitions become low on space.  I have 2 SQL servers that have come close to running out of disk space because of the DB log files.

Thanks,
Ryan

Assistant: One simple way to get Windows Server 2008 to send low disk space e-mail alerts is to use Task Scheduler and the System Log. If the free space falls below the percentage specified in HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters\DiskSpaceThreshold, an event is recorded in the System Log that can trigger a task to send an e-mail message. 


Open Task Scheduler and create a new task.
Enter a name for the task, select "Run whether user is logged on or not", and check "Do not store password."
Add a new trigger on the Triggers tab.
Select "On an event" in the "Begin the task" box.
Set Log to "System", Source to "srv", and Event ID to "2013".
Add a new action on the Actions tab.
Set Action to "Send an e-mail" and fill in the rest of the settings appropriately.
To configure when the low disk space event is recorded in the System Log, open the Registry Editor, navigate to HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters and add a DWORD value named “DiskSpaceThreshold”, setting it to the desired percentage. When the entry does not exist, the default value is 10.
