Narrowly speaking, periodic data indicates the presence of periodic fluctuations, stationary data indicates a relatively constant mean, and sparse data indicates very few non-zero values. Which type does the above time series lean towards?


A: Unable to determine
B: Periodic
C: Stationary
D: Sparse

Assistant: Answer: B
