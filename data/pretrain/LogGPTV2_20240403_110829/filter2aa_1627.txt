Almost all defendants plead guilty
 2 jury trials, both lost
At least 19 defendants have received jail time

 Average: 25 months
Policy Concerns 
Warez traders’ contribution to piracy is 
substantially overstated
 Counting copies substantially distorts “lost sales”
Criminalizing warez trading may have 
counterproductive motivational effects
Congress has criminalized many Americans, 
not just warez trading
 Is P2P file sharing for “financial gain”?
 $5.56/day of infringement
Predictions
Congress wants people to respect the law
 If a law doesn’t work, make it meaner
 But we do not respect unjust laws
Congress wants more scalps
 The double-edge sword of busting P2P file sharers
 Meanwhile, warez traders make great targets
 Congress hates warez traders
 Industry hates warez traders
 The average person can distinguish their conduct from 
warez trading 
Net Effect: More warez traders will be jailed
