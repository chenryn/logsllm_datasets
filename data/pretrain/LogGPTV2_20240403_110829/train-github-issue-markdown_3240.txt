        const response = await request.get(`${baseURL}/document-capture/document-types`,{
            params:{

       request.storageState.newHireCheckListDocTypeID  = newHireCheckListDocTypeID;
    })
**Expected**  
IT should fetch the value from the previous request that is getting stored in
the first call
**Actual**  
I was trying to chain this two request by fetching a data from the response
and storing in the storagestate (request.storageState.employeeDocuments =
employeeDocuments;) , but when i am passing this in the query params of the
second request, it is gettng passed as undefined
