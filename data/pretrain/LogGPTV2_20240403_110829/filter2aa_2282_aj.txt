#### Transition to Replay Mode
Upon reading a tag, the device transitions into replay mode. This feature significantly simplifies the operation of the device within a concealed container, without revealing that the Proxmark3 is hidden. With this update, the replay mode waits for instructions to clone or switch banks, as illustrated in the following flowchart.

#### Training Your RFID Hacking Tools
**RFIDler: The New Kid on the Block**
If the Proxmark3 is like a fine 21-year-old bottle of single malt, RFIDler is more akin to a cheap bottle of vodka. While it may get the job done, it might not provide the most enjoyable experience. A 3D-printed case can improve read quality, but it may still be necessary to adjust coil placement or tweak thresholds using digital potentiometers, especially when working with tags other than the common HID format. The simple circuit design and affordable components make RFIDler a potentially desirable choice for use as a more expendable device that can be left at a target site during a physical penetration test. Unfortunately, the design lacks a method for storing interrogated tag IDs. Although someone with a background in schematic layouts and PIC controllers could add an SD card slot with minimal difficulty, the overhead involved in designing and producing new boards is likely not cost-effective unless a large quantity of devices is required. (Creating a new board to log USB serial output faces similar challenges.)

**RFIDlerPi**
Pairing the RFIDler with an existing low-cost, small computing device, such as the $35 Raspberry Pi, would be ideal. This idea led to the development of RFIDlerPi. The Raspberry Pi complements the RFIDler by providing immediate data logging. By setting the RFIDler to auto-start in the desired reader mode and configuring the Pi with a basic script or program to dump data from the serial line to an SD card or USB storage device, the operator can easily retrieve and control the device. Adding a Wi-Fi dongle to the Pi allows for remote data retrieval and control over a network connection. These techniques can also be applied to other tools, but the RFIDler is particularly easy to work with due to its minimal configuration requirements, especially compared to the Proxmark3, which generally requires compiling a new client for the target architecture and/or making various firmware changes. Alternatively, if high-frequency RFID support is needed, a $50 USB-based NFC reader will likely suffice.

**Custom Enclosures and Concealment**
3D modeling and CAD software enable the creation of custom enclosures to conceal these gadgets. Building information modeling (BIM) libraries even allow for the acquisition of decent likenesses of many objects commonly found in commercial buildings. Often, RFID vendors provide CAD drawings to customers, making it possible to create very convincing fake readers. This is especially true with the growing number of manufacturing-as-a-service businesses, which allow anyone to acquire prints from high-end commercial printers that may be prohibitively expensive to maintain and operate in-house.

#### Concluding Remarks
Among the hacking tools used in this research, each has its strengths and weaknesses. However, the Proxmark3 is currently the best option for overall RFID research, covering both low and high-frequency implementations. If only high-frequency (NFC) capabilities are needed, more affordable options exist, such as libNFC-compatible USB devices. However, these devices typically lack the upgradable low-level modulation functionality available in hardware implementations like the Proxmark3. The ChameleonMini provides a good complement to both, enabling in-circuit NFC tag emulation in a form factor similar to a typical contactless smartcard.

The RFIDler is a project to watch if you are interested in low-frequency RFID, but in its current state (v22-beta), it did not perform as well as the Proxmark3. Based on the collection of tags tested, HID reading appears to be the most reliable. Other formats require more patience and reconfiguration of the POT settings, as well as finding the optimal placement for the card relative to the antenna coil.

The intent of this project was to create a suitable introduction for newcomers and veteran hackers alike, looking to harness the power of their RFID hacking tools. The firmware modifications documented in this paper have been merged into the official Proxmark repository, serving as a useful resource for users and a partial guide for new development. Antenna form models are also being made available as STL files, suitable for printing on most 3D printers or via an online printing service. The concealment designs discussed are intended as exercises for the reader, as the needs of each user are expected to vary greatly based on the application.
