RFIDler:	
  The	
  New	
  Kid	
  on	
  the	
  Block	
If	
  the	
  proxmark3	
  is	
  a	
  nice	
  21-­‐year-­‐old	
  bottle	
  of	
  single	
  malt,	
  RFIDler	
  is	
  more	
  like	
  a	
  cheap	
  bottle	
  of	
  vodka.	
While	
  it	
  might	
  get	
  the	
  job	
  done,	
  it	
  may	
  not	
  be	
  the	
  most	
  enjoyable	
  experience.	
  While	
  a	
  3D	
  printed	
  case	
definitely	
  improves	
  the	
  read	
  quality,	
  it	
  may	
  still	
  be	
  necessary	
  to	
  spend	
  a	
  bit	
  of	
  time	
  fiddling	
  with	
  coil	
placement	
  or	
  adjusting	
  thresholds	
  with	
  the	
  digital	
  potentiometers.	
  This	
  is	
  particularly	
  the	
  case	
  when	
working	
  with	
  tags	
  other	
  than	
  the	
  prevalent	
  HID	
  tag	
  format.	
  The	
  simple	
  circuit	
  design	
  and	
  inexpensive	
components	
  make	
  RFIDler	
  potentially	
  desirable	
  for	
  use	
  as	
  a	
  more	
  expendable	
  device	
  able	
  to	
  be	
  left	
  at	
  a	
target	
  site	
  during	
  a	
  physical	
  penetration	
  test.	
  Unfortunately	
  the	
  design	
  does	
  not	
  include	
  a	
  method	
  for	
storing	
  interrogated	
  tag	
  IDs.	
  Although	
  someone	
  with	
  a	
  background	
  in	
  schematic	
  layouts	
  and	
  PIC	
controllers	
  should	
  be	
  able	
  to	
  add	
  an	
  SD	
  card	
  slot	
  with	
  minimal	
  difficulty,	
  the	
  overhead	
  involved	
  with	
designing	
  and	
  producing	
  new	
  boards	
  is	
  probably	
  not	
  the	
  most	
  cost	
  effective	
  unless	
  a	
  large	
  quantity	
  of	
devices	
  are	
  required.	
  (Creating	
  a	
  new	
  board	
  to	
  log	
  the	
  USB	
  serial	
  output	
  could	
  face	
  similar	
  challenges.)	
RFIDlerPi	
Pairing	
  the	
  RFIDler	
  with	
  an	
  existing	
  low-­‐cost	
  small	
  computing	
  device	
  would	
  be	
  ideal.	
  This	
  is	
  where	
  the	
idea	
  of	
  RFIDlerPi	
  began.	
  The	
  $35	
  Raspberry	
  Pi	
  board	
  compliments	
  the	
  RFIDler	
  quite	
  well	
  providing	
immediate	
  data	
  logging	
  by	
  setting	
  the	
  RFIDler	
  to	
  auto-­‐start	
  in	
  the	
  desired	
  reader	
  mode	
  and	
  the	
  Pi	
configured	
  with	
  a	
  basic	
  script	
  or	
  program	
  for	
  dumping	
  data	
  off	
  the	
  serial	
  line	
  and	
  onto	
  an	
  SD	
  card	
  or	
  USB	
storage	
  device.	
  It	
  is	
  also	
  a	
  small	
  leap	
  from	
  there	
  to	
  add	
  a	
  Wi-­‐Fi	
  dongle	
  to	
  the	
  Pi	
  allowing	
  the	
  operator	
  to	
retrieve	
  data	
  and	
  control	
  the	
  device	
  over	
  a	
  network	
  connection.	
  Naturally	
  these	
  techniques	
  can	
  also	
  be	
applied	
  to	
  other	
  tools	
  but	
  the	
  RFIDler	
  is	
  particularly	
  easy	
  to	
  work	
  with	
  for	
  this	
  task	
  because	
  it	
  requires	
minimal	
  configuration	
  particularly	
  compared	
  to	
  use	
  of	
  a	
  proxmark3	
  that	
  would	
  generally	
  require	
compiling	
  a	
  new	
  client	
  for	
  the	
  target	
  architecture	
  and/or	
  making	
  various	
  firmware	
  changes.	
Alternatively	
  if	
  high-­‐frequency	
  RFID	
  support	
  is	
  needed,	
  a	
  $50	
  USB	
  based	
  NFC	
  reader	
  will	
  likely	
  do	
  the	
trick.	
3D	
  modeling	
  and	
  CAD	
  software	
  then	
  makes	
  it	
  possible	
  to	
  produce	
  a	
  custom	
  enclosure	
  to	
  conceal	
  the	
gadgets.	
  Building	
  information	
  modeling	
  (BIM)	
  libraries	
  even	
  make	
  it	
  possible	
  to	
  obtain	
  decent	
  likenesses	
of	
  many	
  objects	
  commonly	
  found	
  in	
  commercial	
  buildings.	
  Often	
  times	
  RFID	
  vendors	
  will	
  even	
  make	
available	
  CAD	
  drawings	
  to	
  customers	
  making	
  it	
  possible	
  for	
  someone	
  to	
  make	
  a	
  very	
  convincing	
  fake	
reader.	
  This	
  is	
  especially	
  true	
  with	
  the	
  growing	
  assortment	
  of	
  manufacturing-­‐as-­‐a-­‐service	
  businesses	
allowing	
  anyone	
  to	
  acquire	
  prints	
  from	
  high-­‐end	
  commercial	
  printers	
  that	
  may	
  be	
  prohibitively	
expensive	
  to	
  maintain	
  and	
  operate	
  in	
  house.	
Concluding	
  Remarks	
Of	
  the	
  hacking	
  tools	
  used	
  in	
  this	
  research,	
  each	
  has	
  its	
  strengths	
  and	
  weaknesses	
  but	
  it	
  is	
  clear	
  that	
  the	
proxmark3	
  is	
  at	
  this	
  time	
  the	
  best	
  option	
  for	
  overall	
  RFID	
  research	
  of	
  low	
  and	
  high	
  frequency	
implementations.	
  It	
  is	
  worth	
  noting	
  however	
  that	
  if	
  only	
  high	
  frequency	
  (NFC)	
  capabilities	
  are	
  desired	
that	
  more	
  affordable	
  options	
  exist	
  in	
  the	
  form	
  of	
  libNFC	
  compatible	
  USB	
  devices.	
  This	
  approach	
  is	
HOW

  HACKING	
  TOOLS	
primarily	
  limited	
  in	
  that	
  the	
  low-­‐level	
  modulation	
  functionality	
  is	
  typically	
  not	
  upgradeable	
  as	
  is	
  possible	
with	
  hardware	
  implementations	
  like	
  the	
  proxmark3.	
  The	
  ChameleonMini	
  provides	
  a	
  good	
  compliment	
  to	
both	
  of	
  these	
  tools	
  enabling	
  in	
  circuit	
  NFC	
  tag	
  emulation	
  in	
  a	
  form	
  factor	
  similar	
  to	
  a	
  typical	
  contactless	
smartcard.	
The	
  RFIDler	
  is	
  also	
  a	
  project	
  to	
  keep	
  an	
  eye	
  on	
  if	
  only	
  interested	
  in	
  low	
  frequency	
  RFID	
  but	
  in	
  its	
  current	
state	
  (v22-­‐beta)	
  it	
  did	
  not	
  perform	
  as	
  well	
  as	
  proxmark3.	
  Based	
  on	
  the	
  collection	
  of	
  tags	
  tested	
  it	
  would	
appear	
  that	
  HID	
  reading	
  is	
  the	
  most	
  reliable.	
  Other	
  formats	
  required	
  a	
  little	
  more	
  patience	
  and	
reconfiguration	
  of	
  the	
  POT	
  settings	
  and	
  finding	
  a	
  sweet	
  spot	
  for	
  how	
  to	
  place	
  the	
  card	
  in	
  relation	
  to	
  the	
antenna	
  coil.	
The	
  intent	
  of	
  this	
  project	
  was	
  to	
  create	
  a	
  suitable	
  introduction	
  for	
  newcomers	
  and	
  veteran	
  hackers	
  alike	
looking	
  to	
  harness	
  the	
  power	
  of	
  their	
  RFID	
  hacking	
  tools.

  documented	
  in	
this	
  paper

  been	
  merged
