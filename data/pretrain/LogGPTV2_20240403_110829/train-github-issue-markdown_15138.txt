Challenge Waypoint: Local Scope and Functions has an issue.

The code shown below should just print console.log() once, and pass the test.  
However, when I run the code, the sandbox seems to execute twice.  
I tested this by putting new statements in, and it's clear to me that the code
is being executed twice for some reason.  
I tried running the code at least 10 times, it's been executed twice every
time.
My code:
    function myFunction() {
      var myVar = 'hello';
      console.log(myVar);
    }
    myFunction();
    // run and check the console 
    // myVar is not defined outside of myFunction
    // now remove the console.log line to pass the test
