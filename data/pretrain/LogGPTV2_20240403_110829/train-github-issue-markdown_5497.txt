Sorry if this is sparse on details. I mainly want to determine if there is a
bug with `showDrawer` or with the way I attempted to use it.
Yesterday, I attempted to use `showDrawer` with the `7be58b1` alpha branch of
Flutter. The drawer appeared/dismissed correctly, and the widgets I put in the
drawer were correct.
Unfortunately, I noticed that no matter how I attempted to change the state of
what was drawn in the drawer, it would not re-render. In my case, I tried to
put a `Switch` inside a `DrawerItem` to toggle debug mode for my app. I did
confirm that the state did actually change, which led me to think that Flutter
has a bug.
I was following the Stocks demo app quite closely, which uses a Drawer to
toggle the user's market sentiment (`Optimistic` vs `Pessimistic`). However, I
was assuming that the app's behavior would match the Sky Demo app in the
Google Play Store. I only just realized that this app is actually 3 months old
(last update August 25), so it is very possible that in that time, the Stocks
example does not function as it did before.
I am currently unable to try running these examples (though I have found the
instructions), so if someone else can run the Stocks app and determine whether
the Optimistic/Pessimistic radio buttons update the drawer menu or not, that
would be very helpful.
Otherwise, I will look into this more after the break.
