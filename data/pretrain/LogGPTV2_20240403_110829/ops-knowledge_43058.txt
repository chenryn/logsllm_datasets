User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Debugging NGINX - Invalid requests appearing in NGINX log file I'm getting hundreds of entries in my access log with invalid requests like this ...

My log file format is 

'$remote_addr|$cookie__ourcookie|$time_local|$request|$content_length|$content_type|$status|$body_bytes_sent|$upstream_addr|$upstream_response_time';



The IP address varies and some of them are valid user IP addresses (not sure about the others). They often appear in the middle of a valid set of requests and then stop. 

Anyone got an idea why I'd be getting floods of seemingly invalid requests coming in?

I don't think this can be explained just by saying that it's a hack attempt (though some of it could be) - is there any additional debug setting for NGINX? 

Thanks

Assistant: This is part of running a server that's open to anonymous requests from the Internet. It looks like some client is attempting a connection, then immediately dropping it. I expect that it's a drone attempting to see what web server you're running... and to exploit you, if possible. Good thing you're running nginx ;)
