4.3 Evaluation Results
In order to analyze the QoS gain from the use of the OAQ
algorithm, we also compute the measure for the basic fault-
adaptive QoS enhancement (BAQ) scheme for comparison.
The BAQ scheme refers to the case in which the constel-
lation is equipped with in-orbit spares and protected by
the scheduled and threshold-triggered ground-spare deploy-
ment policies, but does not apply the opportunity-adaptive
algorithm. Thus, when a signal is detected in a constellation
under the BAQ scheme, a geolocation result will be deliv-
ered after the initial computation based on either a single
coverage or simultaneous coverage, implying QoS level 2
is not applicable.
We ﬁrst evaluate the constituent measure P (Y = y | k)
using MathematicaTM, based on the parameter values τ =
5, µ = 0.5, ν = 30 (µ and ν are the signal termination
rate and iterative computation completion rate, respectively;
time is quantiﬁed in minutes by default). As described in
Section 2, the values of θ and Tc are 90 and 9, respectively,
for the constellation in question.
The results shows that the OAQ scheme is able to push
a system’s QoS toward the high end, guaranteeing a result
with the best possible quality even in presence of severe

structural degradation.
(which implies two more satellite failures after spare ex-
haustion and a total loss of 25% of nodes in the plane), with
probability 0.44 the constellation will still be able to deliver
a geolocation result rated at QoS level 3. On the other hand,
the evaluation reveals that the value of P (Y = 3 | 12) is
only 0.20 with the BAQ scheme.
Next we evaluate the other constituent measure P (k) us-
ing UltraSAN. The results are shown in Figure 7, where
time is quantiﬁed in hours for λ (node failure rate) and φ
(time to scheduled ground-spare deployment), and η is the
threshold for the number of operational satellites in a plane
(meaning that ground-spare deployment will be triggered
when k = η). From the curves, we observe that when
protected by the scheduled and threshold-triggered ground-
spare deployment policies, the full orbital-plane capacity
(i.e., k = 14) will dominate when node-failure λ rate is

low. On the other hand, the threshold capacity (i.e., k = η)
tends to become dominant as failure rate increases. Specif-
ically, the value of P (10) in Figure 7 is very small when
λ = 10−5, but it rapidly increases and becomes dominant
as λ increases. The reason is that when satellites become
more vulnerable to failure, the capacity of an orbital plane
is likely to drop toward the threshold sooner. However,
as the threshold-triggered ground-spare deployment policy
prevents the scenario in which the plane’s capacity drops
below the threshold from happening, the likelihood that the
system is operating at its threshold capacity becomes dom-
inant when λ is high.

Figure 7: Probability of Orbital-Plane Capacity
Using the results of the constituent measures and Eq. (3),
we evaluate P (Y = y) and P (Y ≥ y). Figure 8 compares
the probabilities that the OAQ and BAQ schemes will de-
liver a result rated at QoS level 3. For this evaluation exper-
iment, we set η to 12 and let φ remain 30000 hours (over
3 years). The curves show that under the OAQ scheme, the
system will achieve level-3 QoS with a greater probabil-
ity as signal completion rate µ decreases (i.e., mean signal
duration increases). More speciﬁcally, when µ decreases
from 0.5 to 0.2, P (Y = 3) increases up to 38% over the do-
main of λ considered. On the other hand, the same variation
does not yield any differences in the behavior of the BAQ
scheme. This exempliﬁes that the QoS gain from the use of
the OAQ scheme is due to its awareness and exploitation of
conditions that arise in the operational environment, while
the BAQ scheme ignores potential opportunities.
Figure 9 displays the results of the QoS measure P (Y ≥
y). The curves reveal that OAQ always makes the system

tem will achieve a QoS level of 2 or above with a probability
of 0.41 under the OAQ scheme, whereas the probability is
decreased to 0.04 under the BAQ scheme. Nonetheless, we
can observe that the values of P (Y ≥ 1) are always equal
for the two schemes (both are equal to 1 over the domain
of λ we consider), meaning that OAQ and BAQ perform
equally well with respect to guaranteeing the delivery of a
result rated at QoS level 1 or above. The results indeed
conﬁrm that the major advantage of the OAQ scheme is its
ability to push a system’s performance to the high end of
the QoS spectrum while guaranteeing the timely delivery of
results with minimally acceptable quality.

We also evaluate the QoS measure as a function of τ .
The results illustrate how the OAQ scheme achieves better
QoS by taking full advantage of the “time allowance.” Fi-

the mean signal duration, we observe that the OAQ scheme

extended opportunity to achieve better geolocation quality.
5 Concluding Remarks
We have developed an approach to coordinated, progres-
sive QoS optimization in satellite constellations. By letting
peer satellites successively join the coordinated geolocation
computation as they become ready to serve within the win-
dow of a dynamically determined opportunity, the OAQ al-
gorithm is able to guarantee the timely delivery of geoloca-
tion results with the best possible quality.
The results of this effort are meaningful. First, the OAQ
framework advocates a marriage between satellite constel-
lation and fault tolerance technologies.
In particular, al-
though sequential localization was studied and proved to be
sound by the satellite research community, the techniques
have not been considered as a solution for tolerating the loss
of satellites in a constellation. The OAQ framework demon-
strates a novel, yet practical application of this satellite tech-
nology for fault tolerance in constellations that are vulner-
able to structural degradation. Further, we exploit peer-to-
peer message passing that is often used for distributed fault
tolerance to enable dynamic, progressive peer-satellite co-
ordination, eliminating the need for ground intervention.
Second, this effort shows that while the continuously
changing readiness-to-serve of satellites creates many dif-
ﬁculties for fault tolerance,
their mobile nature can in-
deed be exploited to enable novel utility of resource redun-
dancy. More generally, from the perspective of fault toler-
ance in systems that comprise large populations of mobile
resources, the results of our investigation demonstrate the
feasibility of adaptation, extension, and generalization of
various existing fault tolerance concepts, such as analytic
redundancy, data diversity, environment diversity, imprecise
computation, and active/passive replication.
It is worth noting that the OAQ framework can be ex-
tended and generalized for many other applications.
In
particular, as researchers in the wireless-networking area
have been investigating advanced applications of TCP/IP
and multicasting in satellite constellations, it will be fea-
sible to extend the OAQ concept to adapt those well-known
fault tolerance schemes, including group membership pro-
tocols, for use in micro- and pico-satellite constellations.
Accordingly, our current work is directed toward adapting
group membership management techniques to the applica-
tions in the environments of distributed autonomous mobile
computing.
