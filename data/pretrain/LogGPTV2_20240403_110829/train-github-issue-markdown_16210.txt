Environment  
Dubbo version: 2.6.x  
Operating System version: all  
Java version: all  
Steps to reproduce this issue  
fastjson <= 1.2.48 considers vulnerable, see
https://www.anquanke.com/post/id/181874  
we are using 1.2.46, I think it's better to use the latest version
fastjson-1.2.58 if possible.
