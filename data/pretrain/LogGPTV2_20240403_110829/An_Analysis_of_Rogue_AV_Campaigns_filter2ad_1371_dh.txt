a daily basis:
– Information on the security state of a domain.
• Norton Safeweb information. For each domain, we have queried its
security status taking advantage of the Norton Safeweb website repu-
tation service2. This allowed us to retrieve information on a variety of
threats known to be present on each domain, ranging from browser ex-
ploits, to malware samples, to phishing sites.

• Google Safe Browsing information. We have taken advantage of the
Google Safe Browsing API3 to detect the presence of threats within a
given domain.
– Information on the domain.
• Registration information. We have parsed the registration data ob-
tained via the WHOIS protocol in order to get information on the iden-
tity of the registrant and of the provided contact email address, as well
as the name of the registrar4.
• DNS relations. By means of DNS queries, we have retrieved for each
domain the associated NS records and all the A records associated to all
the hostnames known to belong to it. Whenever only one domain name
was available and we had no information on the associated hostnames,
we considered as hostnames the domain name itself and the hostname
generated by prepending the standard “www” name.
• Geolocation and AS information. For each web server associated to
the rogue domain through a DNS A record, we have collected information
on its geographical location as well as its associated Autonomous System
number.
• Server uptime and version string. By means of HTTP HEAD pack-
ets, we have tested the responsiveness of the discovered servers and, by
looking at the HTTP response headers, we have collected information
on the server conﬁguration by looking at the advertised server version
string.
– Information on the servers.
3.3 Limitations
Despite our eﬀorts to maximize the threat coverage by aggregating as many
information sources as possible, we are fully aware of the limitations of the
dataset at our disposal. Due to the nature of our observational ability and the
way the rogue AV ecosystem operates, it is impossible to know with certainty
what fraction of the total rogue AV providers across the whole Internet we have
been able to observe. For instance, we have noticed a predominance of servers
physically located in US. This result might be skewed by the type of heuristics
used for identifying rogue AV sites, that could overlook rogue AV servers that
are primarily marketed to non-English languages. Moreover the identiﬁcation
of rogue domains is itself a potential source of bias. Our analysis is based on
the identiﬁcation of rogue AV domains performed by third party sources, and
does not provide any guarantee in terms or precision of classiﬁcation. We have

4 The WHOIS speciﬁcation [6] requires WHOIS records to be human readable, and
does not specify their syntax and their semantics. As a consequence, the data stored
by diﬀerent registrars is often in diﬀerent formats. We have built a generic parser
that handles a vast number of registrars and 17 speciﬁc parser for other common
registrars, but despite of this eﬀort registration information is not available for all
the domains taken into consideration.

M. Cova et al.
indeed identiﬁed through manual inspection of our feeds a limited number of
domains that did not seem to be actually related to the rogue AV threat type.
However, the number of such misclassiﬁcations is negligible relative to the size
of the dataset. Moreover, when mining the diﬀerent rogue AV campaigns, any
possible pollution of the dataset has been implicitly ﬁltered out by our clustering
techniques, as described later.
3.4 Multi-criteria Decision Analysis
To analyze the campaigns through which rogue AV software is distributed, we
have used an attack attribution method that relies on a multi-criteria fusion
algorithm that has proven to bring several advantages with respect to more
traditional clustering methods [25]. Thanks to this method, rogue AV domains
are automatically grouped together based upon common elements likely due
to the same root cause, i.e., same rogue campaign. This attribution method
is based on a combination of a graph-based clustering technique with a data
aggregation method inspired by multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA). This
method has been successfully used previously to analyze other types of attack
phenomena [5,26,27], namely attack events found in honeypot traces.
Generally speaking, the method systematically combines diﬀerent viewpoints
such that the behavioral properties of given phenomena are appropriately mod-
eled by the aggregation of all features.
The attribution method used in this paper consists of three components:
1. Feature selection: we determine which relevant features we want to in-
clude in the overall analysis, and we characterize each element of the dataset
according to each extracted feature denoted by Fk, k = 1, . . . , n (e.g., by
creating feature vectors for each element).
2. Graph-based clustering: an undirected edge-weighted graph is created
regarding every feature Fk, based on an appropriate distance for measuring
pairwise similarities.
3. Multi-criteria aggregation: we combine the diﬀerent graphs of features
using an aggregation function that models the expected behavior of the phe-
nomena under study.
The approach is mostly unsupervised, i.e., it does not rely on a preliminary
training phase.
Feature selection. Among the diﬀerent information tracked through HAR-
MUR, we have selected a number of features that we believed to be likely to
reveal the organized operation of one speciﬁc individual or group.
– Registrant email address (FReg). Whenever available, the email address
provided upon registration of the domain.
– Web Server IP addresses (FIP ), class C (FCl.C), class B (FCL.B)
subnets. To allow the identiﬁcation of servers belonging to the same infras-
tructure, we have separately considered three features corresponding to the
full IP address, its /24 and its /16 network preﬁx.
An Analysis of Rogue AV Campaigns
449
– Nameserver IP address (FN S). The IP address of the authoritative name-
server(s).
– Registered domain name (FDom). We decided to consider as a feature
the domain name itself to be able to detect common naming schemes.
In summary, by analyzing the available features, we have deﬁned the following
feature set: F = {FReg, FIP , FCl.C , FCl.B, FN S, FDom}, which will be used by the
multi-criteria method to link rogue domains to the same campaign.
Graph-based representation. In the second phase of our attack attribution
method, an undirected edge-weighted similarity graph is created regarding each
selected feature Fk, based on an appropriate distance for measuring pairwise
similarities. A speciﬁc deﬁnition of similarity had to be deﬁned for each of the
considered features.
Since feature vectors deﬁned for FIP , FCl.C, FCl.B and FN S are simply sets of
IP addresses (or sets of IP subnets), it is relatively easy to calculate a similarity
between two sets by using the Jaccard similarity coeﬃcient. This coeﬃcient is
commonly used to estimate the amount of overlap between two sets of data.
While simple equality would have been suﬃcient, we wanted to incorporate
into FReg some additional semantics, taking into consideration the usage of spe-
ciﬁc email domains or the usage of speciﬁc keywords. For this reason, we have
given maximum similarity score to identical email addresses, and non-null simi-
larity scores to email addresses sharing same username, same email domain, or
both containing popular AV keywords. For the sake of conciseness we refer the
interested reader to [25] for more detailed information on this measure.
Finally, we wanted to deﬁne a notion of similarity for FDom able to catch
commonalities between rogue domain names having similar patterns, or common
sequences of the very same tokens. We have accomplished this goal by using the
Levenshtein distance 5. To normalize the Levenshtein distance to a similarity
metric, we have used a commonly-used transformation [23] that maps a generic
distance value to a similarity score within the interval [0, 1].
Multi-criteria aggregation. As a ﬁnal step of the multi-criteria analysis,
we have used an aggregation function that deﬁnes how the criteria (i.e., the
site features) must be combined to group rogue domains as a function of their
common elements.
An aggregation function is formally deﬁned as a function of n arguments
(n > 1) that maps the (n-dimensional) unit cube onto the unit interval: f :
[0, 1]n −→ [0, 1]. To model complex requirements, such as “most of” or “at least
two” criteria to be satisﬁed in the overall decision function, we have used Yager’s
Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA) [30].
Other possible aggregation functions that allow for more ﬂexible modeling,
such as the Choquet integral, may also be used and have been considered else-
where [25].
5 Levenshtein distance corresponds to the minimum number of operations needed to
transform one string into the other (where an operation is an insertion, deletion, or
substitution of a single character).
450
M. Cova et al.
Deﬁnition 31 (OWA) [2,30] For a given weighting vector w, wi ≥ 0,
1, the OWA aggregation function is deﬁned by:
(cid:3)
wi =
OW Aw(z) =
n(cid:7)
i=1
wiz(i) =
(1)
where we use the notation z(cid:9) to represent the vector obtained from z by arrang-
ing its components in decreasing order: z(1) ≥ z(2) ≥ . . . ≥ z(n).
In our application, the vector z represents the set of similarity values obtained
by comparing a given pair of domains with respect to all site features Fk, as
deﬁned previously. By associating weights to the magnitude of the values rather
than their particular inputs, OWA aggregation allows us to deﬁne a weighting
vector w that gives lower weights to the two highest scores:
w = [ 0.10, 0.10, 0.20, 0.30, 0.20, 0.10 ]
In other words, we assign more importance to features starting from the third
highest position. The two highest scores will have lower weights (0.10), and thus
at least three strong correlations will be needed to have a global score above 0.3
or 0.4, which will be used as a decision threshold to keep a link between two
domains. A sensitivity analysis has been performed on this decision threshold to
determine appropriate ranges of values [25]; however, due to space constraints,
we do not provide further details in this paper.
4 Insights on the Rogue Security Software Threat
Economy
We will now look into the details of the dataset presented in the previous section
and try to infer information regarding the modus operandi of the individuals at
the root cause of these businesses.
4.1 High-Level Overview
The dataset at our disposal consists of 6,500 DNS entries, collected between
June and August 2009, pointing to 4,305 distinct IP addresses hosting rogue
AV servers. At least 45% (2,935) of all domains were registered through only 29
Registrars.
As a ﬁrst step, we have taken advantage of the DNS information at our dis-
posal to set apart generic hosting services, hosting both rogue AV domains and
benign sites, from servers speciﬁcally deployed for hosting Rogue AV content. We
identiﬁed all DNS entries resolving to the same IP address, and correlated these
with lists of known rogue AV- and malware-serving domains. A total of 2,677
IP addresses (web servers) host only domains that are known to serve rogue AV
software. An additional 118 IPs provide services for both rogue-AV and other
malware-serving domains. The remaining 1,510 IP addresses host both malicious
and benign domains, and are therefore likely to be associated to hosting services
unaware of the illicit use of their infrastructure.

Rogue AV servers localization. Mapping the 2,677 IPs hosting only rogue
AV software to Autonomous System (AS) numbers, we identiﬁed a total of 509
ASes. Interestingly, but yet not surprisingly, the distribution of servers over
ASes is skewed towards some speciﬁc ASes: approximately 37% (984 servers)
are hosted by only 10 particularly popular ASes. As previously pointed out, the
geographical distribution of these servers is heavily skewed towards US locations:
approximately 53% (1,072 servers) are hosted in the USA.
Rogue AV server versions. When looking at the web server type and version
for the 2,677 rogue AV web servers, in some cases we see some very speciﬁc
conﬁgurations that may be indicative of the use of standardized templates or
of a single entity/operator using a ﬁxed conﬁguration. Table 1 reports some of
the most popular observed version strings. Overall, Apache (in various conﬁgu-
rations) seems to be used in well over 40% of the rogue AV servers.
Rogue AV domain registrations. We also looked at the email addresses pro-
vided by all Registrants of rogue AV domains. The list of most popular domains,
shown in Table 2, contains some of the obvious email hosting services (Gmail,
Yahoo! Mail, Lycos, etc.). More interestingly, we see that 26% of the analyzed
domains make use of anonymous domain registration services such as domains-
byproxy.com, whoisprivacyprotect.com, id-private.com, and space.kz. We also see
some cases of ISPs that do not formally oﬀer anonymous domain registration
services, but are rather lax in their veriﬁcation of registrant identities and email
addresses. For instance, Namecheap.com is often associated to registrant names
ranging from “Kyle” to “AA”.
Rogue AV domains and browser exploits. While rogue AV software seems
to be primarily trying to lure users into downloading software to stop non-
existing security issues on their systems (scareware), we found it interesting to
452
M. Cova et al.
evaluate the presence of other threats on the domains by correlating them with
information provided by web crawlers. We determined that 814 of the rogue AV
domains were serving malware of various types; 417 domains attempted to use
browser exploits; 12 domains led to the installation of spyware, and 19 domains
would cause the installation of a trojan. This result underlines the use, in a
minority of cases, of more aggressive strategies for the monetization of clients
lured into visiting the domains.
Towards the big picture. Given the size of the dataset, it is beyond the scope
of this work to describe all the relationships we discovered in the course of our
analysis. We have although tried to generate a “big picture” of the landscape by
plotting in Figure 1 the relationships between servers hosting rogue AV content
and all the domains known to be hosted on them, a total of 235,086 domains. Due
to the complexity of the landscape, we have tried to simplify the visualization
by omitting all IPs that were associated to less than 100 diﬀerent domains. The
represented domains comprise both known rogue AV domains and unrelated
domains that have been discovered as being hosted on the same server thanks to
Fig. 1. Relationships between observed domains and the servers hosting them. Darker
nodes represent rogue AV domains, while lighter nodes indicate benign domains.

robtex.com. We have used darker colors to diﬀerentiate rogue AV domains from
the others.
The subset represented in Figure 1 consists of 174 servers that were hosting
a total of 30,632 distinct domain names. In this observed domain set, 15% of
the total hosted rogue security software, while 9% were observed to host other
types of threats. Interestingly, most of the domain names are linked to a single
web server, but some rogue AV domains were associated, over time, to several
distinct IP addresses, creating some complex subgraphs such as those in the
middle of Figure 1.
Figure 1 shows the complexity of the problem of the identiﬁcation of mali-
cious domains. It highlights the challenges of protecting the web clients from
potentially dangerous sites through IP-based blacklisting methods. Indeed, the
coexistence of both rogue and legitimate domains on the same server IP un-
dermine the applicability of such approaches since it would be detrimental to
perfectly benign sites. We will explore this issue further in Section 6.
4.2 The Campaigns
To get a better understanding of the modus operandi of the rogue AV opera-
tors, we have taken advantage of the multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA)
described in Section 3.4 to mine the dataset and identify separate campaigns
likely to be generated by the action of a single individual or group.
The application of the method has led to the identiﬁcation of 127 separate
campaigns grouping a total of 4,549 domains. The identiﬁed campaigns have
an average size of 35.8 domains, but with a signiﬁcant variance in size. More
speciﬁcally, 4,049 domains are associated to the 39 biggest campaigns, with the
largest comprising 1,529 domains.
In the rest of this Section we will look more closely at three of these campaigns
and we will show through their analysis the value of the MCDA in getting insights
on the dynamics of the rogue AV threat landscape.
Large-scale campaigns. Some of the campaigns identiﬁed by our attribution
method consisted of several hundreds domains. One of such examples is repre-
sented graphically in Figure 2. The graph represents the relationship between
domains (clustered in big, dense groups of small rectangles), the subnets of their
hosting servers (represented with larger, lighter rectangles) and the registrant
email addresses (represented with large, dark rectangles). The nodes at the bot-
tom of the graph represent instead domain registration dates.
Figure 2 groups about 750 rogue domains that have been registered in the
.cn TLD (resolving to 135 IP addresses in 14 subnets), on eight speciﬁc dates
over a span of eight months. However, despite the apparent link to China, the
majority of the IP addresses of the hosting servers were hosted in the United
