I was working on a project using Aptana on Windows. Recently, I changed my operating system and installed Ubuntu on an unpartitioned space. I then downloaded and installed Aptana for Ubuntu and launched it, specifying the same workspace that I used on Windows. The project partition is still intact.

However, I am now unable to use Aptana's code intelligence features. I am wondering if I need to change some paths or if there is a way to clear the data from the workspace (data that Aptana uses) and recreate the project so that it can gather new information. I tried to locate this data in the workspace and project directory but couldn't find it.

What steps should I take to resolve this issue? Thank you in advance for your help.

**Update:**
I have since changed the workspace, and everything is working fine now. After changing the workspace, Aptana prompted me to specify the paths for the interpreter, which I did, and now it is functioning correctly.
