## Steps to Reproduce
I am using onGenerateRoute to perform navigation. My onGenerateRoute method
creates MaterialPageRoute objects with `maintainState: false`. When navigating
backwards, TextField widgets can no longer be focused and edited. This Gist
produces the issue. When the home page first loads, its TextField can be
edited. When you navigate to Next and then go back, the TextField can no
longer be edited.
