snapshot and that belonged to provider p. These two metrics, at-
tractiveness and repulsiveness, associate a business property (the
ability to attract and retain customers) with a topological property
(number of customer links of a provider AS).
Figure 15 shows the scatter plots of attractiveness and repulsive-
ness versus the number of customers, for a recent pair of snap-
shots in 2007. The left plot shows that the likelihood with which a
provider gains a CP link shows positive correlation with the cus-
tomer degree of that provider, as one would probably expect from
the “rich get richer” principle. However, there are several outliers,
and the correlation coefﬁcient is only 64%. The low correlation
indicates that a simple model in which the attractiveness of a node
is proportional to its customer degree would not be very accurate.
The graph at the right is also interesting because it shows an equally
strong positive correlation between the repulsiveness of a provider
and its customer degree. Thus, when we consider the rewiring of
CP links, we observe not only a “preferential attachment” behav-
ior, but also, an equally strong preferential detachment behavior.
Preferential detachment has been largely ignored in the earlier lit-
erature, with the exception of a brief mention in [32].
Attractors and repellers: Figure 15 also shows that there are a few
providers that have very large attractiveness and repulsiveness. We
are interested in the properties of these attractors and repellers of
AS customers, and use the following approach to identify them. For
each pair of snapshots, we calculate Ap and Rp for each provider p.
We ﬁnd that in all snapshot pairs, around 50-100 providers account
for more than 60% of the total number of CP link births in the
Internet. Henceforth, we identify the attractors of a snapshot pair
as the set of providers with the highest attractiveness that account
for at least 60% of the total CP link births. Similarly, we identify
the repellers, based on the set of maximum repulsiveness providers
that account for at least 60% of the total CP link deaths.8
Next, we examine the number of attractors and repellers between
each pair of snapshots over time. Figure 16 shows the evolution of
the total number of attractors and repellers, distributed among AS
types. A decreasing trend in the number of attractors would imply
that the customer gains are shared by a decreasing set of providers,
indicating a shift towards an oligopoly or even monopoly. What we
see, however, is that the number of attractors and repellers shows
an increasing trend. This is signiﬁcant because it implies that the
gains and losses of customers are increasingly shared by a larger
set of providers. In other words, the Internet is not heading towards
an oligopoly or consolidation of providers; instead, the market of
competing providers is increasing in size. We ﬁnd that since 2001,
the number of LTPs in the set of attractors and repellers has stayed
almost constant. This is because around 25 out of the 30 LTPs
appear in these sets in any given snapshot pair. The increase in the
number of attractors and repellers is mainly due to an increasing
number of STPs in these sets.

Figure 16: Evolution of the number of attractors and repellers
(total and among AS types).
Figure 17 shows the number of attractors and repellers in dif-
ferent geographical regions.
Initially, it was the case that most
attractors and repellers were registered in North America. Since
2003-04, however, providers from Europe have outnumbered those
from North America in the attractor and repeller sets.
In addition to the number of attractors and repellers in each geo-
graphical region, we examine the total attractiveness and repulsive-
ness in different regions. The total attractiveness (repulsiveness)
of a set of providers is the fraction of CP link births (deaths) that
are contributed by providers in that set. The top (bottom) panel of
Figure 18 shows the total attractiveness (repulsiveness) of the at-
tractors (repellers) in each geographical region. From 1998 until
2003-04, the attractors in North America had a greater total attrac-
tiveness than those in Europe (coinciding with the period in which
8Choosing different values for this threshold yields qualitatively
similar results.

the number of attractors in North America was larger than that in
Europe). It is interesting, however, that after 2003-04 the attractors
in Europe and North America have similar total attractiveness. This
means that even though the number of attractors is larger in Europe,
they account for a similar fraction of the total CP link births than
the attractors in North America. Similar trends are seen for the total
repulsiveness in Europe and North America.

Figure 18: Evolution of total attractiveness of attractors and
repellers in each geographical region.
Correlation of attractiveness and repulsiveness for the same
AS: We have seen that providers can act as attractors or repellers
of AS customers. Here, we examine whether a correlation exists
between these two properties of the same provider. If so, how do
these correlations vary at different time lags? To answer these ques-
tions, we calculate the crosscorrelation of the attractiveness Ap(t)
and repulsiveness Rp(t) timeseries of the same provider at differ-
ent lags. Instead of examining all providers, we restrict this anal-
ysis only to those providers that were classiﬁed as either attractors
or repellers (according to the 60% rule described earlier) at some
point in their lifetime. We refer to this set of providers as AR,
where |AR|=638. For each provider in AR, we compute the cross-
correlation at different lags, and also the conﬁdence bounds at 99%
signiﬁcance level. The conﬁdence bounds are used to determine
whether there is a signiﬁcant correlation between the attractive-
ness and repulsiveness time series at a particular lag. We ﬁnd 317
providers for which a signiﬁcant correlation exists at some lag. For
each of those providers, we then determine the lag that shows the
maximum absolute correlation.
Figure 19 shows, for the previous 317 providers, the lag at which
the maximum (in absolute value) correlation occurred.
Interest-
ingly, we ﬁnd that in almost all cases the correlation is positive.
Further, we ﬁnd that in 85% of the cases, the maximum correlation
occurs at positive lags. In particular, most of the mass is at lags
1, 2 and 3 snapshots (44.7%, 13.5% and 9.1% of the providers,
respectively). Note that a positive lag l means that we correlate
