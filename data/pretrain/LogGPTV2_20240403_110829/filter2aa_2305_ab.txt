# Rogue RADIUS and Wireless Network Security

## Introduction
- **Rogue Access Points (APs)**: Contrary to common belief, rogue APs can indeed be used to attack corporate wireless networks.
- **EAP Vulnerabilities**: There are numerous ways to exploit the EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol) process.
- **FreeRADIUS**: This tool provides a straightforward method for accepting EAP credentials and integrates well with hostapd, enabling "EAP Peeking."

## EAP Authentication Process
### Standard EAP Authentication
1. **Supplicant** sends an **EAPOL-Start** message.
2. **Authenticator** responds with an **EAP-Request/Identity**.
3. **Supplicant** replies with an **EAP-Response/Identity**.
4. **Authenticator** forwards the identity to the **Authentication Server**.
5. **Authentication Server** sends an **EAP-Request**.
6. **Supplicant** responds with an **EAP-Response**.
7. **Authentication Server** verifies the response and sends an **EAP-Success**.
8. **Authenticator** forwards the **EAP-Success** and **EAP-Key** to the **Supplicant**.

### EAP-TTLS Authentication
1. **Supplicant** initiates the process.
2. **Authenticator** and **Authentication Server** establish a secure tunnel.
3. **User Credentials** are exchanged.
4. **EAP-Success** and **EAP-Key** messages are sent.

### EAP-TTLS Weaknesses
- **Secure Tunnel Establishment**: If the remote certificate is not checked, user credentials can be compromised.
- **Rogue AP + RADIUS**: A rogue AP can disassociate users, learn their credentials, and impersonate them.

## Attacks on EAP-TTLS and PEAP
### EAP-TTLS with PAP
1. **Disassociate Users**: The attacker disassociates legitimate users.
2. **Learn Username and Password**: The attacker captures the credentials.
3. **Copy Credentials**: The attacker copies the credentials to a local EAP configuration.
4. **Impersonate Victim**: The attacker uses the stolen credentials to impersonate the victim.

### PEAP Attack
1. **Disassociate Users**: The attacker disassociates legitimate users.
2. **Learn Domain and Username**: The attacker captures the domain and username using a rogue AP.
3. **Seed Local Password File**: The attacker seeds a local password file.
4. **Continuous Re-authentication**: The user repeatedly attempts to re-authenticate.
5. **Guessing Password**: The attacker continues guessing until the correct password is found.

## Wireless Weaponry for Windows
- **Rogue AP Attacks**: These attacks do not require a sophisticated hacker.
- **Tools**: SoftAP, TreeWalk, Apache, and ActivePerl can be combined to create Airsnarf for Windows.
- **Multiple Rogue APs**: It is possible to run multiple rogue APs simultaneously.

## Rogue Squadron
- **Ease of Setup**: Setting up a rogue AP is relatively simple.
- **Modified Firmware**: Modified WRT54G firmware based on Ewrt, which includes a username and password portal capture and logging feature.

## Security Best Practices
- **Logging**: Ensure external logs are produced.
- **Incident Reporting**: Implement a security incident report mechanism.
- **Key Material Security**: Store key material securely.
- **Secure Management Interface**: Provide a secure management interface.

## Vendor Issues
- **Common Problems**: No logging during errors, self-signed certificates only, lack of change control, incoherent documentation, and protocol non-compliance.
- **Recommended Tests**: Use tools like NMAP, NESSUS, telnet, openssl, and Ettercap to test for vulnerabilities.

## Improving Security
- **Report Flaws**: Report any discovered flaws to the vendor.
- **Document Risks**: Document the risks associated with security gear.
- **Informed Purchases**: Encourage the purchase of more secure equipment.
- **Demonstrate Vulnerabilities**: Show how easy it is to break things.

## Future Directions
- **Hot Spot Defense Kit v2**: An environmental monitor that detects various types of attacks, including mass auth/deauth/assoc attacks, fake AP signatures, and reinjection attacks.
- **Usability**: Security software must be user-friendly to be effective.

## Potterâ€™s Pyramid of IT Security Needs
- **Hierarchical Model**: A pyramid model that ranks security needs based on sophistication and operational cost.

## Upcoming Events
- **ShmooCon 2006**: January 13-15 in Washington, D.C. Pre-registration is available at [shmoocon.org](http://www.shmoocon.org).

## Conclusion
- **Questions?**: Thank you for your attention. Any questions?
