sary must perform signal cancellation from one TX to many
RXs, which becomes increasingly difﬁcult with the number of
RXs. Similarly, to avoid detection of [h(sM ) || h(sM )r], at Di,
the adversary must perform signal cancellation from many TXs
to one RX, which also becomes increasingly difﬁcult with the
number of simultaneous TXs.

synchronize to the MC ON-OFF sequence. Initialization
terminates with the delimiter, allowing each device to note
the beginning of the DH message exchange phase. Figure 8
shows the initialization step for four legitimate devices.
2) DH message exchange: All devices use public DH
parameters (G, q, g), where G is a cyclic group of order q
and g is a generator of G. Each Di broadcasts a message
mi = IDi||zi containing ID of Di and the DH primitive
zi = gXi, where Xi
is chosen from Zq uniformly at
random. The hub also broadcasts mA = IDA||zA.
3) Integrity Veriﬁcation: The integrity veriﬁcation phase is
initiated by the transmission of the delimiter by the hub,
which serves as a SYNC message for all Dis. The Dis use
VERSE to verify the integrity of the protocol transcript
s = m1||m2|| . . .||m N−1||mA. The hub records the total

the correct number of devices participated in the
protocol. If veriﬁcations is passed, Dis and A participate
in VERSE by transmitting [h(s) || h(s)r]. Otherwise, Dis
and A raises an alarm by transmitting all ON slots in the
remaining of the sequence. The devices stay in pairing

mode for a period τ
is completed. This is to ensure that they paired with the
legitimate hub and no other pairing operation takes place.
If a second MC ON-OFF sequence is overheard by a
device Di, the device raises an alarm.
4) Conﬁrmation: Upon successful veriﬁcation, each device
calculates a pairwise key kDi,A = gXi·XA . Moreover,
A displays a “SUCCESS” message. Else, A displays
“FAILURE” and broadcasts a “RESTART” message.

B. Secure Bootstrapping using VERSE
To bootstrap a set of new devices with the hub, we execute a
DH key exchange [40] for establishing pairwise keys over the
public channel and use VERSE to protect the integrity of the
protocol execution. The bootstrapping protocol consists of the
following steps, which are also outlined in Fig. 9.
1) Initialization: A total of N − 1 legitimate devices D1,
D2, . . . , DN−1 participate in the group. The protocol is
initialized when the user sets the hub (A) to pairing mode
and loads the total number of devices N (including A)
to A. For a period τ (e.g., two mins), the hub broadcasts
a random MC ON-OFF sequence that ends in delimiter
ON-ON-OFF-OFF-ON-ON. During that period, the user
turns on each Di to set it to pairing mode, and all Di’s
We emphasize that the message integrity veriﬁcation can
be integrated with any group association protocol, such as
the group Difﬁe-Hellman key exchange [41]. For this work,
we establish pairwise keys with A. Once pairwise keys are
established, A can securely distribute a group key to each
device.
V. SECURITY ANALYSIS
We ﬁrst analyze the security of VERSE by demonstrating
the infeasibility of signal cancellation when multiple veriﬁers
are used to verify the integrity of the protocol digest. We then
evaluate the security of the DH-based protocol presented in
Section IV-B.

A. Signal Cancellation from One TX to Multiple RXs
Generate,
In this section, we analyze the signal cancellation attack
for the adversary introduced in Section III. We consider the
transmission of an MC ON-OFF sequence from one TX to
multiple RXs and show that when at least three RXs act as
veriﬁers, signal cancellation becomes infeasible.
Consider the scenario of Fig. 10(a), where a transmitter
TX broadcasts an MC ON-OFF coded message m1, which is
received by RX1, RX2, and RX3. Let x denote the symbols
of the transmitted message, and y1, y2 and y3 denote the
received symbols at RX1, RX2, and RX3, respectively. The ON
slots of m1 are realized by a series of random symbols from
the constellation plane, whereas the OFF slots are realized by
no transmission. To cancel any ON slot at all three receivers,
an adversary M must ﬁnd a location (cid:8)M such that it can
simultaneously annihilate y1, y2 and y3, at the respective RXs.
This is because x contains random selected symbols that do
not allow the prediction of y1, y2 and y3. Therefore, M must
perform a relay attack by being positioned at a location that
cancels the received signal at each RX, independently of x.
Let M transmit x(cid:2) and RX1, RX2, and RX3 receive y(cid:2)
1, y(cid:2)
2,
1 = −y1,
and y(cid:2)
3 = −y3. That is, M’s transmission arrives at
2 = −y2 and y(cid:2)
y(cid:2)
each RX location with an inverse phase and the same amplitude
as y1, y2 and y3. For each RX, M’s location must satisfy the
phase difference equation (4). The solution to (4) is an ellipse
with TX and RX located at the focal points. For three RXs,
(cid:8)M must lie in the intersection of three ellipses, as shown in
Fig. 10(a). However, the following proposition shows that no
such location exists.
Proposition 1. Three distinct ellipses sharing one focal point
irrespective of the plane they lie in, do not have a common
point of intersection.
Proof. The proof is included in Appendix A.
3. The cancellation attack is successful if y(cid:2)
Based on Proposition 1, there is no location such that M can
perform simultaneous cancellation of the TX’s signal at three
RXs with a single transmission. There are some degenerate
RX arrangements that make cancellation from a single location
possible. This is when two of the RXs are at the same location,
in which case only the intersection of two ellipses needs to
be considered. We consider such cases to be point-speciﬁc,
which could be avoided by requesting distinct RX locations or
including additional veriﬁers. Moreover, cancellation becomes
possible if M is positioned at the common focal point, i.e., at
the same location as the TX, which is detectable by the user.
Extending Proposition 1, no common intersection point exists
for n >3 if such point cannot be found for n = 3. Furthermore,
common intersection points between two ellipses exist as shown
in Fig 10(b), and any point over a set of ellipses can be
selected when n = 1 (see Section III-B). This sets the minimum
requirement
to thwart signal cancellation to three. For the
proposed bootstrapping protocol, it is expected that at least
three veriﬁers (e.g., the hub plus two other legitimate devices)
will be available, as our work targets a group setting. If not,
auxiliary devices can be added for veriﬁcation purposes. We
emphasize that there is no need for an authenticated channel
between any auxiliary device and legitimate device.
Signal cancellation by a multi-device adversary: A multi-
device adversary may be capable of canceling a transmission
at more than two RXs. To scale this attack to more RXs,
the adversary can deploy additional devices that lie on the
intersection of the respective ellipses deﬁned by TX-RX pairs.
For instance, Fig. 11(a) shows the deployment of two devices
to perform cancellation at RX1, RX2 and RX3. The device at
location A targets at RX1 and RX2, whereas from B to RX3.
However, such a coordinated attack poses signiﬁcant chal-
lenges. First, the transmission of the cancellation signal at
location A contaminates the reception of the TX’s signal at
location B. The latter is necessary to compute the cancellation
signal for RX3. Second, the cancellation signal at locations A
and B superimpose at RX1 and RX2, thus signiﬁcantly degrad-
ing the cancellation capability. This multi-device attack can be
successful only if the interference caused by multiple cancellers
is minimal, which is only possible with close placement to the
respective RXs when omnidirectional antennas are used. Such
a close placement may be apparent to the user.
A higher-cost approach for performing cancellation to mul-
tiple RXs without causing unintended interference is to deploy
devices with highly directional antennas. This scenario is de-
picted in Fig. 11(b). Three devices are deployed at locations A,

B, and C. Each device is equipped with two directional anten-
nas. One is pointed to the TX to receive the transmitted signal
and the other is pointed to the RX to perform cancellation.
For a group of n veriﬁers, 2n directional antennas are needed.
For a typical device separation of 10-30 ft. with an adversary
located at a distance of 60 ft. he is required to achieve 9◦-
26◦ beamwidth. Such narrow beamwidths can be created by an
antenna array [42] or a parabolic antenna [43]. A 9◦ beamwidth
or a 26◦ beamwidth antenna array requires approximately 30
antenna elements or 17 antenna elements, respectively.
Our scheme does not provide protection against a multi-
device adversary that can perfectly cancel MC ON-OFF se-
quences with highly-directional non-interfering transmissions
from devices located at ideal locations. For all practical pur-
poses, such a potent adversary is in full control of multiple
wireless channels and can erase/inject any message at will.
B. Signal Cancellation from Multiple TXs to One RX
We now consider the inverse scenario where an MC ON-
OFF message m is synchronously transmitted by n TXs and is
received at a single RX. For this scenario, we examine whether
signal cancellation at the RX is possible. A key observation for
this case is that although the n TXs convey the same ON-
OFF message m, ON slots are realized using different and
randomly selected symbols at each TX. Therefore, Let xi =
{xi(1), xi(2), . . . , xi(k)} denote the transmitted symbols from
one TXi modulating m and yi = {yi(1), yi(2), . . . , yi(k)} the
received symbols at RX. To cancel the incoming signal at RX,
M has to transmit the inverse signal,

does not have knowledge of the randomly transmitted symbols

cancellation irrespective of the values of the xis, the adversary
must be positioned such that it cancels each individual xi.
