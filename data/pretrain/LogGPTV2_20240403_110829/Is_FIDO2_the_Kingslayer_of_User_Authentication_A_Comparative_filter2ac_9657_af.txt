password, but passwords can be more easily phished). We
think that if the industry does not take these user concerns
seriously, FIDO2 will fail as the password replacement.
Recommendation: The user has to be able to securely
revoke access to their account without the need to ﬁrst recover
access themselves in order to have a chance of account lock-
down before the illegitimate access. Potential inspiration can
be drawn from established solutions, such as key revocation in
PKI [31] or GPG, or revisiting key sharing as in Pico [27].
3) Corner cases: Some participants pointed out that the
Yubico Security Key cannot be used on devices without an
(accessible) USB port. In fact, in contrast to passwords, which
can be entered anywhere—the FROM-ANYWHERE beneﬁt
by Stajano [27]—token-based authentication will currently
always have corner cases in which it is not applicable (e.g.,
public or embedded computers without accessible USB, Blue-
tooth, or NFC interface). We argue that it is unlikely that this
situation changes in the near future.
Recommendation: Users should be informed about corner
cases in which they cannot make use of passwordless authen-
tication, since layman users presumably cannot predict conse-
quences of the combination of client devices and authenticator.
4) Form and features of the authenticator: A few par-
ticipants pointed out problems with the authenticator we
used in our study, a Yubico Security Key. Most of those
concerns were about the limited connectivity and hence lack
of support for other client devices (e.g., mobile phone via
NFC or Bluetooth). Other concerns were about the price of
the device, its robustness and usability, the lack of additional
authentication to the authenticator, or more generally about the
fact that users have to carry an extra device.
Recommendation: Since FIDO2 does not deﬁne the form
of the authenticator, just its capabilities and protocols, this is
a great opportunity to tailor authenticator form and features
to user demands, maybe avoiding the need to buy and carry
dedicated devices and offer personalized authentication.

For instance, mobile phones have been recognized as attrac-
tive second factors, since most users already own one, carry
them with them all the time and notice their loss quickly [74],
[75], they are increasingly equipped with biometrics, and they
support multiple media (NFC, Bluetooth). However, other
forms are imaginable, such as wearables, like ﬁtness tracker
wristbands. Yet, an interesting question is to which extent
the authenticator device type could undermine the security
guarantees of FIDO2, for instance, if users lose their phone
regularly [76], do not protect access to their device [77], [78],
or depend on the battery life of the phone [34].
5) Establishing mental models: Finally, during our study,
we noticed that our participants identify "authentication" auto-
matically with "passwords" and naturally did not have a mental
model of how passwordless authentication with a security
key works, what its beneﬁts and drawbacks are, or its ap-
plicability. The results of our Group1FA and Group1FAcon show
that our introduction video panned out positive—our Group1FA
mentioned the security beneﬁts, ease of use, and acceptance
of FIDO2 passwordless authentication while Group1FAcon had
remaining trust issues and misunderstood beneﬁts. Yet, the
result of Group1FA is not ideal. Some participants expressed
mistrust into the hardware token, mostly due to a lack of
transparency, and recent security incidents [79] could reinforce
such mistrust. Thus, work that increases the trustworthiness of
the device [80] is important. Further, our participants raised
concerns that we did not cover in our video (e.g., recovery
and revocation) or that we did not predict (e.g., corner cases).
Recommendation: Transition to FIDO2 passwordless au-
thentication requires establishing mental models of users that
see authentication more systematically, drawing from existing
models about physical keys (e.g., possession of key means no
other can access the account; spare keys can & should be
used; do not store them with personally identifying informa-
tion; associate account and the right physical key; etc.).
B. Threats to Validity
Our participants were comparatively young, which is a
common problem of lab studies in a university setting. On the
other hand, the ATI scores, which usually correlate negatively
with the age variable, are in our sample comparable to other
studies that had a much more diverse age distribution among
their participants (e.g., [50]). This suggests that our results
should be fully transferable to age-diverse samples.
For our hands-on tasks, we used artiﬁcial scenarios, since
FIDO2 passwordless authentication is not (reliably) supported
by any service, and our setup phase is simplistic (i.e., no
wizards or user settings, but in-place substituting passwords
for the security key on the registration/landing page of our
websites). Prior work has identiﬁed the setup phase as prob-
lematic [40] and recommended to study this phase separately.
However, for FIDO2 the used security key was really just
plug’n’play and even Group1FAcon with minimal, optional
instructions was able to intuitively use it. Thus, we argue this
allowed us to study the larger context of users switching to
1FA and to derive concrete recommendations for future studies
and their design of the user registration processes.
We only used one type of authenticator (the Yubico Security
Key, as one of the most popular authenticators in the market)
and did not collect any behavioral data (i.e. the time required
for the login process). Therefore, some of our results may
only apply to this particular setting and neglect such objective
aspects of usability. Both these choices resulted from our
focus on qualitative research questions, such as for users’
perceptions of FIDO2 and subjective obstacles for the usage of
this technology. Future work could follow a pure quantitative
approach,
the
usability and acceptance of different types of authenticators
(e.g. different form factors or pin protection) as well as the
effects on the time efﬁciency of the login process. However,
prior works have already shown that in general security keys
are more efﬁcient [25], [43] than text-based passwords.
that uses a between-subject design to test
VIII. CONCLUSION
The FIDO2 standard has great potential
to become the
successor to text-based passwords for user authentication on
the web. To gain insights on whether also end-users would
accept this paradigm shift from the traditional knowledge-
based factor to the new possession-based factor, we conducted
a large-scale lab study. Our participants shared with us their
impressions, thoughts, and concerns about using FIDO2 pass-
wordless authentication with a Yubico Security Key.
Our results show that users consider FIDO2 passwordless
authentication as more usable and more acceptable than the
traditional password-based authentication, but also that con-
cerns remain that impede many users’ willingness to abandon
passwords. Most notably, the fear of losing the authenticator
is not only connected with account recovery but also with
an imminent illegal access to the account and the need for
revocation—-a subjective threat model by users that differs
from the objective risk assessment of FIDO2. Further, limited
applicability and critique of the authenticator devices them-
selves have been pointed out. Thus, our results highlight new
hurdles on the road to replace passwords with FIDO2 1FA.
We think that these concerns are rooted in a gap between the
user’s personal perspective onto this new technology and the
global view of the FIDO2 designers that might not sufﬁciently
include the users’ views. In the end, fulﬁlling users’ subjective
needs is what determines the success of a new authentication
technology. What would be the point of trying to kill the king
if the people would not follow the new ruler? We made some
recommendations for the supporters and adopters of FIDO2 in
an effort to address the concerns we could identify.
