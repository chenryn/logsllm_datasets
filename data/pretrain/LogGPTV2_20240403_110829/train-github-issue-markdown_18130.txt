# Environment
    Windows build number: Microsoft Windows NT 10.0.18362.0
    Windows Terminal version: 0.6.2951.0
# Steps to reproduce
  1. Set the `historySize` of a terminal profile to a sufficiently large number. (I modified the default profiles in my testing)
  * 32747 or larger for powershell
  * 32797 or larger for wsl
  2. Create a new terminal tab using the modified profile
  3. Record the current reported terminal size
  * Use `$Host.UI.RawUI.WindowSize.Width; $Host.UI.RawUI.WindowSize.Height` for powershell
  * Use `tput cols; tput lines` for wsl
  4. Resize the terminal window
  5. Record the new reported terminal size
# Expected behavior
Resizing the terminal window should change the reported terminal dimensions.
Terminal resize behavior should be unaffected by historySize.
# Actual behavior
When the historySize profile setting is sufficiently large resizing the
terminal window does not change the reported terminal dimensions.
