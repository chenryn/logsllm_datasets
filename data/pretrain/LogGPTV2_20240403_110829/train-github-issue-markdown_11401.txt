### ðŸ’»
  * Would you like to work on this feature?
### What problem are you trying to solve?
TypeScript 4.7 Beta ships with `in` and` out` modifiers for type parameters on
type declarations.
    type Getter = () => T;
    type Setter = (value: T) => void;
    interface State {
        get: () => T;
        set: (value: T) => void;
    }
TypeScript developers using Babel will need to support this syntax.
These `in` and `out` modifiers can only be placed on type parameter
declarations for
  * `type` aliases
  * `interface` declarations
  * `class` declarations
  * ~~_possibly_~~ `class` expressions
It is possible to have `in`, `out`, and `in out`. Duplicates are not allowed,
and `in` must always come before `out`.
### Describe the solution you'd like
For the next minor version of Babel, we may want to implement this feature.
### Describe alternatives you've considered
There are alternative compilers, but that would not be ideal for Babel users.
