### Blacklist and Dataset Overview

**Blacklists:**
- I-Blocklist [26], MalwareBytes [25], Snort Labs [42], TrustedSec [48], Haley [10], Darklist [19], SIP Blacklist [45], VoIPBL [51], DShield [57], NoThink [34], OpenBL [36], Cruzit [16], BruteforceBlocker [18], Clean MX [13], Bad IPs [5], MaxMind [32], ImproWare [27], Cleantalk [14], My IP [33]

**Table II: Categorization of Blacklists**
- The table categorizes four types of blacklists based on the type of malicious activities they capture. Each row lists the number of blacklists and their maintainers for each category.

### Data Collection and Validation

**Malicious IP Addresses:**
- Collected from Netlab's [2] collection of Mirai-infected hosts in September 2016, totaling approximately 3.9 million addresses.
- The first 7 days (1.1 million IP addresses) were used as a validation set (Mv).
- The remaining 16 days (2.8 million IP addresses) were used for testing (Mte).

**Legitimate IP Addresses:**
- Collected by identifying web clients communicating with popular web servers at a mid-sized US university in September 2016.
- Only TCP connections that exchanged payload with the server were included, excluding scans.
- This resulted in approximately 61,000 legitimate IP addresses.
- The first 7 days (16,000 IP addresses) were used as known-legitimate sources (Ltr).
- The next 7 days (12,000 IP addresses) were used for validation (Lv).
- The remaining 16 days (33,000 IP addresses) were used as future legitimate sources (Lte).

### DDoS on DNS Root (DDoSDNS)

- **Scenario Description:**
  - Examines a TCP SYN flood attack on the DNS B-root server [58].
  - Non-anonymized data before and during the attack was obtained from the dataset provider.
- **Malicious IP Addresses (Mte):**
  - Identified as those sending TCP SYN floods to the server for two hours on June 25, 2016, totaling 5.5 million addresses.
- **Known-Legitimate Sources (Ltr):**
  - Sources of DNS queries one day before the attack (2.7 million IP addresses).
- **Future Legitimate Sources (Lte):**
  - Sources of DNS queries during the attack event (16,000 IP addresses).

### Limitations

- **Publicly Available Blacklists:**
  - The dataset includes only publicly available blacklists, while many providers offer more accurate, for-pay blacklists [78].
  - Public blacklists are widely used, and nearly 60% of surveyed network operators use them [56].
  - Using public blacklists ensures the work is repeatable and allows for free data sharing.
- **Scenario Datasets:**
  - Capture a small sample of legitimate/malicious IP addresses active at a given time.
  - Rely on other security technologies like SpamAssassin, which may also be used by blacklist maintainers.
  - Similar limitations exist in other published works [80], [70], [75], [78], [55].
  - Recent studies have used Alexa’s top 10,000 list, but its rankings are not ideal measures of legitimacy [73], [61].
- **Dated Datasets:**
  - Captured in 2016, making it challenging to find recent, non-anonymized data.
  - Despite being dated, the datasets faithfully capture sources of legitimate and malicious traffic simultaneously.

### Evaluation Setup

- **Performance Metrics:**
  - Recall: Percentage of malicious sources blacklisted.
  - Specificity: Percentage of legitimate sources not blacklisted.
- **Competing Approaches:**
  - **Best:** The best-performing blacklist in a given scenario.
  - **Historical:** All IP addresses listed in any blacklist, assuming "once malicious, always malicious."
  - **PRESTA+L:** Uses spatio-temporal analysis and expansion, removing known-legitimate sources.
  - **BLAG:** Aggregates and selectively expands blacklists using historical decay, matrix factorization, and thresholding.

### Performance Comparison

- **BLAG vs. Competitors:**
  - BLAG achieves high specificity (95–99%) and better recall (3.5x–114x improvement).
  - BLAG detects attackers 13.7 days faster than competing approaches.
- **Specificity/Recall Tradeoff:**
  - For the Email scenario, BLAG improves recall from 4.7% to 69.7%, with 95% specificity.
  - For DDoSUniv and DDoSDNS scenarios, BLAG’s recall ranges from 6.4–56.1%, with 97.9–99.5% specificity.
- **Faster Detection:**
  - BLAG reports malicious sources 9.4 days faster than the best blacklist, 10.3–16.1 days faster than historical blacklists, and 8.8–13.4 days faster than PRESTA+L.

### Sensitivity Analysis

- **Contribution of Expansion:**
  - Without expansion, BLAG still outperforms the best and historical blacklists.
  - Expansion further improves recall, with a small loss in specificity.
- **Filtering Attack Traffic:**
  - BLAG filters more malicious activity: 69.7% of spam, 56.1% of infected devices, and 6.4% of attack queries, compared to much lower percentages for other blacklists.

### Conclusion

- **Recommendation System:**
  - BLAG’s recommendation system helps achieve better specificity and faster detection of malicious sources.
- **Overall Benefits:**
  - BLAG provides a significant improvement in both recall and specificity, making it a valuable tool for network security.
