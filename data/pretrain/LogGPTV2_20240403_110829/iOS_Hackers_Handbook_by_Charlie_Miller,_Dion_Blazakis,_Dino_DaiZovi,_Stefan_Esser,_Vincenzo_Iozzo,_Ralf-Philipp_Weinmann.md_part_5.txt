Apple’s iPhone Confi guration Utility for Mac or Windows. This graphical
utility lets administrators create and manage confi guration profi les. These
profi les can be installed onto iOS devices over a USB connection, by attach-
ing them to an e-mail message sent to the device’s owner, or by hosting them
on a web server.
To manage a larger number of devices, enterprises should use a Mobile Device
Management (MDM) system. Apple provides one in Lion Server through the
Profi le Manager service. This service works well for workgroups and small- to
medium-sized organizations. For larger enterprises, however, a commercial
third-party MDM solution would likely work best.
This section covers the basics of confi guration profi les and how to use the
iPhone Confi guration Utility and Lion Server’s Profi le Manager to create and
install a simple confi guration profi le.
Mobile Confi guration Profi les
A confi guration profi le is structured as an XML property list fi le (referred to
as a plist) with data values stored in Base64. The plist data may optionally
be signed and encrypted, in which case the fi le will be structured according
to RFC 3852 Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS). Because confi guration
profi les may contain sensitive information, such as user passwords and
Wi-Fi network passwords, they should be encrypted if the profi le is going
to be sent over a network. The use of a Mobile Device Management (MDM)
server automates this, which is recommended for any enterprise managing
iOS devices.
The configuration profile consists of some basic metadata and zero or
more configuration payloads. The configuration profile metadata includes
the human-readable name, description, and creating organization of the
profile, as well as some other fields that are used only under the hood.
The configuration payloads are the most important portions of the profile,
because they implement the configuration options specified in the profile.

The available configuration payload types in iOS 5 are listed and described
in Table 2.1.
Table 2.1: Confi guration Profi le Payload Types
PAYLOAD DESCRIPTION
Removal Password Specifi es a password that users must enter to remove a
locked profi le from the device
Passcode Policy Defi nes whether a passcode is required to unlock the device
and how complex this passcode must be
E-mail Confi gures the user’s e-mail account
Web Clip Places a web clipping on the user’s home screen
Restrictions Restricts the user of the device from performing certain
actions, such as using the camera, iTunes App Store, Siri,
YouTube, Safari, and so on
LDAP Confi gures an LDAP server to use
CalDAV Confi gures a user’s network calendar account using CalDAV
Calendar Subscribes the user to a shared CalDAV calendar
Subscription
SCEP Associates the device with a Simple Certifi cate Enrollment
Protocol server
APN Confi gures an iOS device with a cellular baseband (iPhone or
iPad) to use a specifi c mobile carrier
Exchange Confi gures a user’s Microsoft Exchange e-mail account
VPN Specifi es a Virtual Private Network (VPN) confi guration for
the device to use
Wi-Fi Confi gures the device to use the specifi ed 802.11 network
Each payload type has a set of property list keys and values that defi ne the
supported set of confi guration settings. The full list of these keys and their
available values for each payload are listed in Apple’s iOS Confi guration Profi le
Reference in the iOS Developer Library. Although you can create the confi gura-
tion profi le manually using this specifi cation, only Mobile Device Management
product developers are likely to do so. Apple recommends that most users
rely on Apple’s iPhone Confi guration Utility or a Mobile Device Management
product to create, manage, and deploy their confi guration profi les. Enterprises
with a small number of iOS-based devices are likely to confi gure them using
the iPhone Confi guration Utility, which is described next.

iPhone Confi guration Utility
Apple’s iPhone Configuration Utility is a graphical utility for Mac OS X
and Windows that helps users create, manage, and install configuration
profi les on iOS devices. At the time of writing, the latest available version is
3.4, which has just been updated to support the new confi guration options in
iOS 5.0.
The iPhone Confi guration Utility automatically creates a root certifi cate
authority (CA) certifi cate in the user’s keychain the fi rst time it is run. This CA
certifi cate is used to sign the certifi cate that is automatically created for each
device connected over USB to the host running the iPhone Confi guration Utility.
These certifi cates are used to sign and encrypt confi guration profi les for secure
transmission to the intended device. This allows you to securely send confi gura-
tion profi les containing user credentials over insecure networks (such as e-mail
or the web), assuming that the recipient device had already been assigned a
certifi cate by the host running the iPhone Confi guration Utility.
Creating a Confi guration Profi le
As a demonstration of how to use the iPhone Confi guration Utility, here you
create a simple confi guration profi le containing only a Passcode Policy payload
and install it on an iOS device over a direct USB connection.
To get started, click Confi guration Profi les under Library in the sidebar.
This lists your existing confi guration profi les, if any. To create a new pro-
fi le, click the New button. This brings up the confi guration pane shown in
Figure 2.1 that allows you to confi gure the general and identity settings of
the confi guration profi le. You should fi ll in the Name, Identifi er, Description,
and Organization fi elds to identify this profi le to the users whose devices you
will be installing it on.
The other important setting in this pane is the Security setting, which defi nes
whether the profi le can be removed. This option can be set to Always, With
Authorization, or Never. If it is set to With Authorization, the profi le can be
removed only if the user enters the confi gured Authorization password. If the
option is set to Never, the user may not remove it from his or her device. The
only way to remove the profi le from the iOS user interface is to erase the device
completely by going into the Settings application, tapping the General sub-
menu, proceeding into the Reset submenu, and tapping the Erase All Content
and Settings button. This performs a very similar operation to the remote
wipe command that a user may send through iCloud’s Find My iPhone or
an enterprise administrator may send through ActiveSync or Mobile Device
Management. Keep in mind that knowledgeable users can also jailbreak their
device and forcibly remove the confi guration profi le by deleting it from the
underlying fi lesystem. For more details on the underlying confi guration profi les

Chapter 2 n iOS in the Enterprise 19
on the fi lesystem, see David Schuetz’s BlackHat 2011 whitepaper “The iOS
MDM Protocol.”
Figure 2.1: Creating a configuration profile
Now, you can actually create a confi guration payload for the profi le. Click
the Passcode section in the left-hand side of the Confi guration Profi le pane.
This brings up the available passcode settings in the right-hand side. You
should confi gure these settings to require a suffi ciently strong passcode that
is appropriate to the sensitive nature of the data that will be accessible on your
employees’ iOS devices. As an example, Figure 2.2 shows our recommended
settings for an iOS device that may be used to store or access sensitive enter-
prise data.
The iPhone Confi guration Utility lets you distribute confi guration profi les
to devices by either installing them over USB, sending them to users attached
to an e-mail message, or exporting the profi le as a .mobileconfig fi le that can
cc0022..iinndddd 1199 44//1166//22001122 55::4422::2255 PPMM
20 Chapter 2 n iOS in the Enterprise
be hosted on a web server. We use the simplest method of profi le installation
here: installing the new profi le on an iOS device directly connected to a Mac
with a USB cable.
Figure 2.2: Configuring the Passcode payload
Installing the Confi guration Profi le
After you connect an iOS device to your Mac with a USB cable, it appears
under the Devices heading in the sidebar of the iPhone Confi guration Utility,
as shown in Figure 2.3. Click the Confi guration Profi les tab to list the already
installed profi les on the device, as well as the confi guration profi les created by
the iPhone Confi guration Utility that have not yet been installed on the device.
Confi guration profi les that haven’t been installed yet will have an Install but-
ton next to them. Click the Install button next to the profi le that you have just
created to install it on your iOS device. This brings up the screen shown in
Figure 2.4 to confi rm the installation of the confi guration profi le.

The confirmation screen in Figure 2-4 shows the basic information
on the configuration profile and lists the configuration payloads that it
includes. The profile has a green Verified badge on it. This is because
cc0022..iinndddd 2211 44//1166//22001122 55::4422::2266 PPMM
22 Chapter 2 n iOS in the Enterprise
the iPhone Configuration Utility automatically creates a self-signed
X.509 root certificate authority certificate for itself. It uses this root CA to
create a signed certificate for each device that is connected over USB while
it is running. These device-specific certificates are used by the iPhone
Configuration Utility to sign and encrypt configuration profiles sent to that
device. Because the device has the certificate installed on it automatically,
it can verify the authenticity of a configuration profile that is sent to it over
USB, e-mail, or the web.
If you tap More Details, you see a screen like the one shown in
Figure 2.5. This screen enables you to examine the certifi cate used to sign the
confi guration profi le and lists more details about the confi guration payloads
contained in it.
Figure 2.5: Configuration profile details screen
Go back to the previous screen and tap the Install button to install the
confi guration profi le. This brings up the confi rmation dialog as shown in
Figure 2.6.
If you have not already set a passcode on the device, or your existing pass-
code does not satisfy the complexity requirements in the profi le, installing
the confi guration profi le forces you to set a passcode immediately. This will
look like the screen shown in Figure 2.7. Notice how the instructions describe
how strong the passcode must be according to the settings in the confi gura-
tion profi le.

After you have set a passcode, you should see a screen like the one shown
in Figure 2.8, confi rming that the profi le has been successfully installed. Now
the settings specifi ed in the confi guration profi le should have also taken effect.

To verify this, go to the Passcode Lock screen in the General menu of Settings.
It should look like the screen in Figure 2.9. As you can see, some of the options
have been disabled by the profi le and are grayed out.

Updating Profi les
The iPhone Confi guration Utility automatically creates and installs a certifi -
cate on each iOS device that is connected to the Mac running it. This allows
confi guration profi les to be securely updated because there will be an existing
secure trust relationship between the desktop running the iPhone Confi guration
Utility and the mobile device. If a confi guration profi le is installed with the
same identifi er as an already installed confi guration profi le, and the same cer-
tifi cate as the existing profi le signs the new profi le, it will replace the existing
confi guration profi le.
The certifi cate-based secure pairing between a desktop running the iPhone
Confi guration Utility and the iOS devices it has been connected to over USB
allows you to install the initial confi guration profi le directly over USB, and then
safely send encrypted and signed updated confi guration profi les over e-mail
or the web. As long as users are trained to ensure that the profi les they are sent
display the green Verifi ed label on the installation screen, this is both secure
and time-effi cient.
Removing Profi les
You can remove a confi guration profi le by opening the Settings application,
selecting the General submenu, and selecting the Profi le submenu (or Profi les
if more than one is installed). Normally, this will look like Figure 2.10. You can
remove the profi le by tapping the Remove button.

26 Chapter 2 n iOS in the Enterprise
Keep in mind, however, that confi guration profi les can also be confi gured
to be removed only with an authorization password or to prevent removal
completely. If the profi le has a removal passcode confi gured, the user will be
prompted for the removal passcode, as shown in Figure 2.11. Alternatively, if the
profi le does not support removal, the user will not even see a Remove button
in the Profi le details screen.
Figure 2.11: Removing a protected profile
Applications and Provisioning Profi les
The iPhone Confi guration Utility can also be used to install applications and
provisioning profi les onto iOS devices. For now, all you need to know is that
custom applications require an Apple-issued Provisioning Profi le for the appli-
cation’s developer in order to run on an iOS device. These provisioning profi les
may be installed separately or they may also be bundled with the application
when it is distributed.
Mobile Device Management
The iPhone Confi guration Utility can be used to perform basic enterprise man-
agement of iOS devices, but it clearly doesn’t scale well to managing a large
number of devices. For enterprises with a larger number of devices, Apple has
cc0022..iinndddd 2266 44//1166//22001122 55::4422::2288 PPMM
Chapter 2 n iOS in the Enterprise 27
implemented Mobile Device Management (MDM) functionality in iOS that
allows the devices to be managed completely over the air.
Apple has released the MDM API to third-party providers, and a large number
of third-party Mobile Device Management product vendors exist. Apple also
provides an MDM solution in Lion Server. Apple’s implementation in Lion Server
is the Profi le Manager; a facility for managing settings for users of both iOS
devices and computers running Mac OS X. Profi le Manager is a simple MDM
solution that should work well for small organizations or workgroups. If you
are managing a large number of devices or require more features than Profi le
Manager provides, you should investigate one of the many commercial MDM
solutions that support iOS-based devices.
MDM Network Communication
In Apple’s MDM architecture (depicted in Figure 2.12), network communication is
performed between three entities: the user’s iOS device, his or her organization’s
MDM server, and Apple’s Push Notifi cation Service (APNS). The MDM server
communicates with the APNS to publish push notifi cations that are routed to
the specifi ed device and delivered through that device’s persistent connection
to the APNS. Upon receiving a push notifi cation, the iOS device establishes a
direct connection to the confi gured MDM server.

Figure 2.12: MDM network communication
The iOS device itself maintains a persistent connection to one of the APNS
courier servers at courier.push.apple.com, which is the centralized com-
munications channel used for all push notifi cations on iOS. This connection is
established using client-certifi cate authenticated TLS to TCP port 5223 and uses
cc0022..iinndddd 2277 44//1166//22001122 55::4422::2299 PPMM
28 Chapter 2 n iOS in the Enterprise
the XMPP protocol. iPhones and iPads with a cellular data connection make
this connection over the cellular network, whereas other mobile iOS devices
are able to make this connection only when they are on a Wi-Fi network. The
XMPP protocol was designed for the Jabber instant messaging system; how-
ever, it is fl exible enough to be used for any system needing presence notifi ca-
tion and a publish/subscribe model for message distribution. The iOS device
simply informs Apple’s APNS servers which topics to subscribe to, and those
servers will route messages published to those topics to the device. In the case
of MDM, a managed client device is confi gured to subscribe to a unique topic
corresponding to the MDM server that is managing the device.
The MDM server acts as a push notifi cation provider, similar to the way
third-party application developers implement push notifi cations for their iOS
applications. In this role, the server connects to Apple’s APNS gateway serv-
ers at gateway.push.apple.com. This connection is also over client-certifi cate
authenticated TLS, but this time it is to TCP port 2195. Push notifi cations are
formatted as JSON dictionaries and are sent to Apple’s APNS servers through
a custom binary network protocol. The push notifi cation provider also makes a
similar connection to Apple’s APNS servers on TCP port 2196 for the feedback
service. Apple does not guarantee that these services will remain on a defi ned
IP subnet, so it recommends that fi rewall administrators permit outbound
access to Apple’s entire assigned IP space of 17.0.0.0/8. For more specifi cs on
