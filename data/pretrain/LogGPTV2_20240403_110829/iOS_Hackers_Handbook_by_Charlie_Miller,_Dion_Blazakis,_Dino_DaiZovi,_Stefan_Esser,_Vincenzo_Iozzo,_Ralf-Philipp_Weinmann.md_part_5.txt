### Apple’s iPhone Configuration Utility for Mac or Windows

Apple's iPhone Configuration Utility is a graphical tool available for both Mac and Windows. This utility enables administrators to create and manage configuration profiles, which can be installed on iOS devices via USB, email, or a web server.

For managing a larger number of devices, enterprises should use a Mobile Device Management (MDM) system. Apple provides an MDM solution in Lion Server through the Profile Manager service, which is suitable for workgroups and small- to medium-sized organizations. For larger enterprises, a commercial third-party MDM solution is often more appropriate.

This section covers the basics of configuration profiles and how to use the iPhone Configuration Utility and Lion Server’s Profile Manager to create and install a simple configuration profile.

### Mobile Configuration Profiles

A configuration profile is structured as an XML property list file (referred to as a plist) with data values stored in Base64. The plist data may be signed and encrypted, following the RFC 3852 Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS). Since configuration profiles may contain sensitive information, such as user passwords and Wi-Fi network passwords, they should be encrypted if sent over a network. An MDM server automates this process, which is recommended for any enterprise managing iOS devices.

The configuration profile consists of basic metadata and one or more configuration payloads. The metadata includes the human-readable name, description, and creating organization of the profile, along with other fields used internally. The configuration payloads are the most important parts of the profile, as they implement the specified configuration options.

#### Table 2.1: Configuration Profile Payload Types

| **Payload** | **Description** |
|-------------|-----------------|
| **Removal Password** | Specifies a password that users must enter to remove a locked profile from the device. |
| **Passcode Policy** | Defines whether a passcode is required to unlock the device and its complexity. |
| **E-mail** | Configures the user’s email account. |
| **Web Clip** | Places a web clipping on the user’s home screen. |
| **Restrictions** | Restricts the user from performing certain actions, such as using the camera, iTunes App Store, Siri, YouTube, Safari, etc. |
| **LDAP** | Configures an LDAP server to use. |
| **CalDAV** | Configures a user’s network calendar account using CalDAV. |
| **Calendar Subscription** | Subscribes the user to a shared CalDAV calendar. |
| **SCEP** | Associates the device with a Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol server. |
| **APN** | Configures an iOS device with a cellular baseband (iPhone or iPad) to use a specific mobile carrier. |
| **Exchange** | Configures a user’s Microsoft Exchange email account. |
| **VPN** | Specifies a Virtual Private Network (VPN) configuration for the device. |
| **Wi-Fi** | Configures the device to use the specified 802.11 network. |

Each payload type has a set of property list keys and values that define the supported configuration settings. The full list of these keys and their available values for each payload is provided in Apple’s iOS Configuration Profile Reference in the iOS Developer Library. While you can create the configuration profile manually, Apple recommends using the iPhone Configuration Utility or an MDM product for most users.

### iPhone Configuration Utility

Apple’s iPhone Configuration Utility is a graphical tool for Mac OS X and Windows that helps users create, manage, and install configuration profiles on iOS devices. As of the latest version (3.4), it supports the new configuration options in iOS 5.0.

The utility automatically creates a root certificate authority (CA) certificate in the user’s keychain the first time it is run. This CA certificate is used to sign the certificate created for each device connected over USB. These certificates are used to sign and encrypt configuration profiles for secure transmission to the intended device, allowing secure sending of profiles containing user credentials over insecure networks.

### Creating a Configuration Profile

To demonstrate, we will create a simple configuration profile containing only a Passcode Policy payload and install it on an iOS device over a direct USB connection.

1. **Start the iPhone Configuration Utility** and click on "Configuration Profiles" under "Library" in the sidebar.
2. **Create a New Profile** by clicking the "New" button. Fill in the Name, Identifier, Description, and Organization fields to identify the profile.
3. **Configure Security Settings**: Set the "Security" option to "Always," "With Authorization," or "Never." If set to "With Authorization," the profile can only be removed with a configured authorization password. If set to "Never," the profile cannot be removed without erasing the device.
4. **Add a Passcode Policy Payload**: Click the "Passcode" section in the left-hand side of the Configuration Profile pane and configure the passcode settings.
5. **Install the Profile**: Connect an iOS device to your Mac with a USB cable. The device will appear under the "Devices" heading in the sidebar. Click the "Configuration Profiles" tab, select the new profile, and click "Install."

### Installing the Configuration Profile

After connecting the iOS device, it will appear in the iPhone Configuration Utility. Click the "Configuration Profiles" tab to list the installed and uninstalled profiles. Uninstalled profiles will have an "Install" button. Click "Install" next to the new profile to confirm and install it.

### Updating Profiles

The iPhone Configuration Utility creates and installs a certificate on each iOS device connected to the Mac running it. This allows secure updates of configuration profiles because there is an existing trust relationship between the desktop and the mobile device. If a new profile with the same identifier and signed by the same certificate is installed, it will replace the existing profile.

### Removing Profiles

To remove a configuration profile, open the Settings app, select "General," then "Profile" (or "Profiles" if multiple are installed). Tap the "Remove" button. Note that profiles can be configured to require an authorization password for removal or to prevent removal entirely.

### Applications and Provisioning Profiles

The iPhone Configuration Utility can also install applications and provisioning profiles onto iOS devices. Custom applications require an Apple-issued provisioning profile to run on an iOS device. These profiles can be installed separately or bundled with the application.

### Mobile Device Management (MDM)

For large-scale device management, Apple’s MDM functionality in iOS allows devices to be managed over the air. Apple provides an MDM solution in Lion Server called Profile Manager, which is suitable for small organizations or workgroups. For larger enterprises, commercial MDM solutions are often more appropriate.

#### MDM Network Communication

In Apple’s MDM architecture, network communication occurs between three entities: the user’s iOS device, the organization’s MDM server, and Apple’s Push Notification Service (APNS). The MDM server communicates with the APNS to publish push notifications, which are routed to the specified device. Upon receiving a push notification, the iOS device establishes a direct connection to the MDM server.

- **iOS Device**: Maintains a persistent connection to the APNS at `courier.push.apple.com` using client-certificate authenticated TLS to TCP port 5223 and the XMPP protocol.
- **MDM Server**: Acts as a push notification provider, connecting to Apple’s APNS gateway servers at `gateway.push.apple.com` over client-certificate authenticated TLS to TCP port 2195. It also connects to the feedback service on TCP port 2196.

Apple recommends that firewall administrators permit outbound access to Apple’s entire assigned IP space of 17.0.0.0/8 to ensure reliable communication.
