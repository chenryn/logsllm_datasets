# Enable Isolated Compute on Your Azure Data Explorer Cluster

Isolated compute virtual machines (VMs) allow customers to run their workloads in a hardware-isolated environment dedicated to a single customer. Clusters deployed with isolated compute VMs are ideal for workloads that require a high degree of isolation for compliance and regulatory purposes. The compute SKUs offer security without compromising configuration flexibility. For more information, see [compute isolation](/azure/security/fundamentals/isolation-choices#compute-isolation) and [Azure guidance for isolated compute](/azure/azure-government/azure-secure-isolation-guidance#compute-isolation).

Azure Data Explorer supports isolated compute using the **Standard_E64i_v3** SKU. This SKU can automatically scale up and down to meet the demands of your application or enterprise. Isolated compute support is available in the following regions:
* West US 2
* East US
* South Central US

Although isolated compute VMs are more expensive, they are the best choice for workloads that require server instance-level isolation. For more information about supported SKUs for Azure Data Explorer, see [Select the Correct VM SKU for Your Azure Data Explorer Cluster](manage-cluster-choose-sku.md).

> [!NOTE]
> [Azure Dedicated Host](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/virtual-machines/dedicated-host/) is not currently supported by Azure Data Explorer.

## Enable Isolated Compute on an Azure Data Explorer Cluster

To enable isolated compute on an Azure Data Explorer cluster, follow one of these processes:
* [Create a Cluster with Isolated Compute SKU](#create-a-cluster-with-isolated-compute-sku)
* [Select the Isolated Compute SKU on an Existing Cluster](#select-the-isolated-compute-sku-on-an-existing-cluster)

## Create a Cluster with Isolated Compute SKU

1. Follow the instructions to [create an Azure Data Explorer cluster and database in the Azure portal](create-cluster-and-database.md).
2. In the **Basics** tab of the **Create a Cluster** process, select **Standard_E64i_v3** from the **Compute specifications** drop-down menu.

## Select the Isolated Compute SKU on an Existing Cluster

1. On the **Overview** screen of your Azure Data Explorer cluster, select **Scale up**.
2. In the search box, type *Standard_E64i_v3* and click on the SKU name, or select **Standard_E64i_v3** from the SKU list.
3. Click **Apply** to update your SKU.
