User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题What are the marks of a great VPN? Should the VPN have a no-log policy or is it better to have a log policy? I think a log policy is OK, I am not doing anything illegal just protecting myself from illegal surveillance by criminals. 
Does it really matter what country the VPN is based in? Wouldn't it be better if it is based in your home country, as it will have to follow privacy laws in that country?
Lastly, are VPN connections really secured because I noticed that during one intrusion on my device the hacker forcibly downgraded the version of the VPN (to one with less servers). The change was done smoothly and had I not been looking for it would have missed it. I repaired it by reinstalling the VPN software but how would a hacker be able to do that?

Well, in most of time this is a "speedy" problem rather than a security problem, your connection with a server based in mainland China can be slow or fast depending on were you live, if slow timeouts can occur or loss of connectivity which can disclose your IP address per turn. In that case it can be better to estabilish a connection with servers that are setup in your own country or neighboring countries so there will be a less likelihood of disclosure or leakage. Some VPN-Services provide a kill-switch function that kills the connection between you and the internet if the VPN-connection is lost.

I think the hacker/intruder was trying to connect you with VPN-servers that were compromised. Basic reinstallation/reconnecting will overcome this.
