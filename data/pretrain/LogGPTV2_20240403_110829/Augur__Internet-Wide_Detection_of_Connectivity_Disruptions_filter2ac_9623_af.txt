TABLE IV: Summary of the top 10 sites by the percent
of reﬂectors experiencing outbound blocking. We provide a
categorization of each website using deﬁnitions provided in
Appendix A. We additionally report the percent of countries
for which we ﬁnd a site inbound-blocked by at least one
reﬂector.
100 reﬂectors (5%) or less. As before, these results agree with
our expectation that sites are typically not blocked across the
bulk of reﬂectors.
Several sites show extensive ﬁltering, as listed in Tables III
and IV. Here, we have determined reﬂector country-level
geolocation using MaxMind [35]. We found six sites inbound-
blocked for over 20% of reﬂectors across at least half the
countries, with the human rights website hrcr.org inaccessible
by 41.7% of reﬂectors across 83% of countries. The top 10
inbound-blocked sites correspond closely with anticipated cen-
sorship, with 9 found in the Citizen Lab Block List (CLBL). A
surprisingly widely blocked Alexa-listed site is varlamov.ru,
ranked third; in fact, it actually redirects to LiveJournal, a
frequent target of censorship [39], [52]. On a related note,
the IP address for amtrak.com is the sixth most inbound-
blocked site—but it is co-located with two CLBL websites,
439
underscoring the potential for collateral damage that IP-based
blacklisting can induce.
The top outbound-blocked sites tell a similar tale, although
with less pervasive ﬁltering. The most outbound disrupted site
is nsa.gov, unreachable by 7.4% of reﬂectors across 23.3%
of countries. Given the nature of this site, perhaps the site
performs the ﬁltering itself, rather than through reﬂector-side
disruption. All top 10 sites are known frequently blocked
websites, listed in the CLBL.
This aggregate analysis of connectivity disruption from
both site and reﬂector perspective accords with our prior
understanding that while disruption is not ubiquitous, it may
be pervasive. It affects a large proportion of reﬂectors, and
can widely suppress access to particular sites. The sites for
which our method detects interference closely correspond
with known censored websites. This concordance bolsters
conﬁdence in the accuracy of our method’s results.
Country-level connectivity disruption. Analysis of aggre-
gate connectivity disruption across countries provides another
perspective for validation. Using reﬂector country geolocation
provided by MaxMind [35], Table V ranks the top 10 countries
by percentage of blocked sites across any reﬂectors in the
country. Figure 8 portrays this at a global scale, illustrating
that some degree of connectivity disruption is experienced by
hosts in countries around the world.
We see that many of the most disruptive countries corre-
spond closely with countries known to heavily censor, such
as China, Iran, Sudan, Russia, and Turkey [41]. Of the top
10 countries, the OpenNet Initiative [41] has reported Internet
censorship of political or social material in every country
except Latvia and the United Kingdom.2 More recently, re-
ports have documented Latvia as heavily censoring gambling
websites and political content [4], [47]. Our results appear
plausible for the United Kingdom as well, which has a
history of ﬁltering streaming and torrent sites [10] and adult
content [36].
While we are aggregating at a country granularity, these
disruptions may actually be implemented in different ways
within a single country. These differences result
in non-
uniform ﬁltering policies, as has been observed with the
Great Firewall of China [24], [54] and UK adult content
ﬁltering [36]. In Figure 9, we plot the variation in the num-
ber of sites blocked for reﬂectors within each country. We
remove countries without any site ﬁltering. We observe that
for most countries, there exists some variation in the disruption
experienced by reﬂectors within a country, suggesting that
interference indeed often differs across networks even within
a country. The extent of this behavior is widespread and
highlights the importance of connectivity measurements from
many vantage points, since ﬁndings may differ across nearby
networks and geolocations.
2We list Hong Kong separately from China, although trafﬁc from Hong
Kong may traverse Chinese networks and experience disruption.

TABLE V: Summary of the top 10 countries ranked by the percentage of sites blocked at any reﬂectors within each country

blockage bias towards CLBL sites, and statistics on inbound versus outbound blockage.
C. Tor Bridge Case Study
In the previous section, we analyzed our method’s results in
aggregate, ﬁnding them in line with reasonable assumptions
and existing reports of Internet censorship. Here, we use
several known Tor bridges as a case study providing an ad-
ditional (though limited) check of correctness. This validation
increases conﬁdence in our method, as we are able to repli-
cate previous ﬁndings with regards to which sites experience
blocking, the country of censorship, and the directional nature
of disruption.
Our set of sites contains three Tor Obfuscation4 (obfs4)
Bridges open on port 80, for which we have some ground
truth on their censorship. A prior study [25] tested all three
bridges from vantage points in the U.S., China, and Iran, over
a ﬁve-month period. The ﬁrst two bridges (TB1 and TB2)
were included in the Tor Browser releases. Fiﬁeld and Tsai
detected that only China frequently inbound-blocked these,
albeit inconsistently, likely due to the federated nature of the
Great Firewall of China. The third bridge (TB3) had been only
privately distributed, and remained unblocked throughout the
study.
Our ﬁndings are consistent with this ground truth. Both TB1
and TB2 experienced inbound ﬁltering in China only, while
connectivity to TB3 was never disrupted. Of the 36 reﬂectors
in China, we detected inbound ﬁltering of TB1 for 8 reﬂectors,
no ﬁltering for 8 reﬂectors, and inconclusive evidence for
the remaining 20 (due to lack of a statistically signiﬁcant
signal during our hypothesis testing). For TB2, 9 reﬂectors
were inbound-blocked, 11 were unblocked, and 16 were un-
decided. TB3, expected to be unblocked, was accessible by 22
reﬂectors, with the remaining 14 undetermined. These ﬁndings
accord with prior results regarding the distributed and disparate
nature of Chinese Tor ﬁltering.

ﬂector and a site; they do not indicate the location where that
ﬁltering might take place. As a result, our techniques cannot
disambiguate the scenario where a remote site blocks access
from all reﬂectors in an entire region from the scenario where
an in-country censor ﬁlters trafﬁc along that path. For example,
ﬁnancial and commerce sites may block access from entire
countries if they have no customers in those regions.
Additionally, the current measurements only employ TCP
packets using port 80. Thus, they do not disambiguate ﬁl-
tering of IP addresses versus ﬁltering of only port 80 trafﬁc
associated with that IP address. An extension of our system
might perform follow-up measurements on different ports to
determine whether ﬁltering applies across all ports. On a
related note, our techniques only measure TCP/IP-based ﬁl-
tering; future work may involve correlating the measurements
that we observe with tools that measure global ﬁltering at other
layers or applications (e.g., HTTP, DNS).
Other sources of inaccuracy. Existing IP geolocation tools
have known inaccuracies [27], particularly for Internet infras-
tructure (i.e., IP addresses that do not represent end hosts). As
a result, some of our results may not reﬂect precise characteri-
zations of country-level ﬁltering. As IP geolocation techniques
improve, particularly for IP addresses that correspond to
Internet infrastructure, we can develop more conﬁdence in the
country-level characterizations from Section VI. Additionally,
various network mechanisms,
including anycast, rerouting,
trafﬁc shaping, and transient network failures, may make it
difﬁcult
to disambiguate overt ﬁltering actions from more
benign network management practices. Some of these effects
