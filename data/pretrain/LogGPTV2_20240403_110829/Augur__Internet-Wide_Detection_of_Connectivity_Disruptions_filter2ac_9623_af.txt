### Analysis of Inbound and Outbound Blocking

Several sites show extensive filtering, as listed in Tables III and IV. We determined reflector country-level geolocation using MaxMind [35]. Six sites were found to be inbound-blocked for over 20% of reflectors across at least half the countries. The human rights website hrcr.org was inaccessible by 41.7% of reflectors across 83% of countries. The top 10 inbound-blocked sites closely align with anticipated censorship, with 9 out of 10 found in the Citizen Lab Block List (CLBL). A surprisingly widely blocked Alexa-listed site is varlamov.ru, ranked third; it redirects to LiveJournal, a frequent target of censorship [39], [52]. The IP address for amtrak.com is the sixth most inbound-blocked site, but it is co-located with two CLBL websites, highlighting the potential for collateral damage from IP-based blacklisting.

The top outbound-blocked sites tell a similar story, although with less pervasive filtering. The most outbound-disrupted site is nsa.gov, unreachable by 7.4% of reflectors across 23.3% of countries. Given the nature of this site, it is possible that the site performs the filtering itself rather than through reflector-side disruption. All top 10 sites are known frequently blocked websites, listed in the CLBL.

This aggregate analysis of connectivity disruption from both site and reflector perspectives confirms our prior understanding that while disruption is not ubiquitous, it can be pervasive, affecting a large proportion of reflectors and widely suppressing access to particular sites. The sites for which our method detects interference closely correspond with known censored websites, bolstering confidence in the accuracy of our results.

### Country-Level Connectivity Disruption

Analyzing aggregate connectivity disruption across countries provides another perspective for validation. Using reflector country geolocation provided by MaxMind [35], Table V ranks the top 10 countries by the percentage of blocked sites across any reflectors in the country. Figure 8 illustrates this at a global scale, showing that some degree of connectivity disruption is experienced by hosts in countries around the world.

Many of the most disruptive countries, such as China, Iran, Sudan, Russia, and Turkey, are known to heavily censor. Of the top 10 countries, the OpenNet Initiative [41] has reported internet censorship of political or social material in every country except Latvia and the United Kingdom. More recent reports have documented Latvia as heavily censoring gambling websites and political content [4], [47]. Our results for the United Kingdom also appear plausible, given its history of filtering streaming and torrent sites [10] and adult content [36].

While we aggregate at a country level, these disruptions may be implemented differently within a single country, leading to non-uniform filtering policies. This has been observed with the Great Firewall of China [24], [54] and UK adult content filtering [36]. In Figure 9, we plot the variation in the number of sites blocked for reflectors within each country, excluding countries without any site filtering. We observe that for most countries, there is some variation in the disruption experienced by reflectors within a country, suggesting that interference often differs across networks even within a country. This behavior is widespread and highlights the importance of connectivity measurements from multiple vantage points, as findings may differ across nearby networks and geolocations.

### C. Tor Bridge Case Study

In the previous section, we analyzed our method’s results in aggregate, finding them in line with reasonable assumptions and existing reports of internet censorship. Here, we use several known Tor bridges as a case study to provide an additional (though limited) check of correctness. This validation increases confidence in our method, as we are able to replicate previous findings regarding which sites experience blocking, the country of censorship, and the directional nature of disruption.

Our set of sites includes three Tor Obfuscation (obfs4) Bridges open on port 80, for which we have some ground truth on their censorship. A prior study [25] tested all three bridges from vantage points in the U.S., China, and Iran over a five-month period. The first two bridges (TB1 and TB2) were included in the Tor Browser releases. Fiﬁeld and Tsai detected that only China frequently inbound-blocked these, albeit inconsistently, likely due to the federated nature of the Great Firewall of China. The third bridge (TB3) had been only privately distributed and remained unblocked throughout the study.

Our findings are consistent with this ground truth. Both TB1 and TB2 experienced inbound filtering in China only, while connectivity to TB3 was never disrupted. Of the 36 reflectors in China, we detected inbound filtering of TB1 for 8 reflectors, no filtering for 8 reflectors, and inconclusive evidence for the remaining 20 (due to lack of a statistically significant signal during our hypothesis testing). For TB2, 9 reflectors were inbound-blocked, 11 were unblocked, and 16 were undecided. TB3, expected to be unblocked, was accessible by 22 reflectors, with the remaining 14 undetermined. These findings accord with prior results regarding the distributed and disparate nature of Chinese Tor filtering.

### Limitations and Sources of Inaccuracy

Our techniques do not disambiguate the location where filtering might take place. Therefore, they cannot distinguish between a remote site blocking access from all reflectors in an entire region and an in-country censor filtering traffic along that path. For example, financial and commerce sites may block access from entire countries if they have no customers in those regions.

Additionally, the current measurements only employ TCP packets using port 80. Thus, they do not disambiguate filtering of IP addresses versus filtering of only port 80 traffic associated with that IP address. An extension of our system might perform follow-up measurements on different ports to determine whether filtering applies across all ports. On a related note, our techniques only measure TCP/IP-based filtering; future work may involve correlating the measurements with tools that measure global filtering at other layers or applications (e.g., HTTP, DNS).

Other sources of inaccuracy include known inaccuracies in existing IP geolocation tools [27], particularly for Internet infrastructure (i.e., IP addresses that do not represent end hosts). As a result, some of our results may not reflect precise characterizations of country-level filtering. As IP geolocation techniques improve, particularly for IP addresses that correspond to Internet infrastructure, we can develop more confidence in the country-level characterizations from Section VI. Additionally, various network mechanisms, including anycast, rerouting, traffic shaping, and transient network failures, may make it difficult to disambiguate overt filtering actions from more benign network management practices. Some of these effects can introduce noise into our measurements.
