User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题IIS-like UI for http.sys programs Does anyone know if there is a open-source or built-in way to view ALL IIS and http.sys endpoints/sites via a GUI?

The problem I have is that I'm a little wary of having no visibility for http.sys applications (e.g. SQL Reporting Services 2008) and their status, logs, security settings, etc.  I know there is documentation how to do this via command line and registry hacks but it seems there has to be a better way.

Assistant: HTTP Server API Configuration, is a GUI tool that lists endpoints and allows you to set ACLs. The author 'Nicolas Dorier' also has a nice article 'Demystify http.sys with HttpSysManager' on CodeProject.com which describes his tool.
