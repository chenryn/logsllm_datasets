Fig. 3. Rank correlation between the trafﬁc burstiness, i.e., relative standard deviation (RSD) of
trafﬁc rate distribution, and the maximum 95-percentile ﬂuctuation of the different sites
In summary, our characterization and analysis of the dependence of 95-percentile on
the aggregation window size yields the following important observations:
– For sites and networks of high and medium trafﬁc rates, the 95-percentile follows
a noisy decreasing trend, as the aggregation window size increases. This trend can
be modeled as polynomial decrease.
– Fluctuations on the computed 95-percentile due to the size of the aggregation win-
dow are higher in low and medium-volume trafﬁc mixes and negligible in high-
volume mixes. Trafﬁc burstiness is indicative of how susceptible the 95-percentile
is to ﬂuctuations.
4 95-Percentile from Flow Data
4.1 Measurements
NetFlow data are typically used to bill individual sites in web-hosting environments,
where the trafﬁc crossing router interfaces and incrementing SNMP counters might be
destined to many different customers. NetFlow aggregates the packets of a ﬂow and re-
ports its duration, size, and timestamps among other attributes. Then, the 95-percentile is
On the 95-Percentile Billing Method
213
computed from the ﬂow records by uniformly distributing the size of a ﬂow over its lifes-
pan and by counting the overall contribution of the ﬂows in each aggregation window.
The volume of a ﬂow may exhibit variations, which are smoothed by aggregating the size
of a ﬂow across its duration. This “horizontal” aggregation is illustrated in Figure 4. It
effectively shifts bytes between neighboring windows, which affects the estimated trafﬁc
volume for a window and may, therefore, skew the computed 95-percentile.

Fig. 4. Effect of ﬂow aggregation on trafﬁc volume observed during a time interval
To investigate the effect of ﬂow aggregation on the 95-percentile we used the tcp-
dump traces. We ﬁrst computed the 95-percentiles of time series constructed from
packet-level data. These time series attribute each packet to the correct window and
do not suffer from the problem discussed above. Then, we grouped packets in the tcp-
dump traces into ﬂows, using the standard ﬁve-tuple ﬂow deﬁnition, and computed the
amount that each ﬂow contributed to each window. In this case, the resulting time series
were skewed due to ﬂow aggregation.
In Figure 5, we plot the 95-percentile versus the window size for the packet and
ﬂow-based data using the tcpdump traces of the individual website and of the enterprise
campus network. The plots correspond to three distinct behaviors. In Figure 5(a), we
observe that the curves corresponding to using ﬂow and packet-level data to compute
the 95-percentile are almost indistinguishable, indicating negligible artifacts introduced
from ﬂow aggregation. The maximum increase of the 95-percentile in the range of
window sizes between 30 and 400 seconds in only 0.42%. In Figures 5(b) and 5(c),
we show the corresponding plots for the ﬁrst and second month of the campus trace,
respectively. Figure 5(b) exhibits small differences between the the packet and ﬂow-
based curves. For a window size of 300 seconds, the 95-percentile increases by 1%,
whereas the maximum increase in the range above 30 seconds is 2.89%. Figure 5(c)
demonstrates a signiﬁcant decrease on the ﬂow-based 95-percentile. This decrease is
consistent through out the range of window values and has a maximum value of 9.3%
at a window size of 200 seconds. At the commonly-used 300-second window size the
decrease is 5.8%.
In Table 1 we illustrate the total trafﬁc volume that was shifted due to the effect of
Figure 4 between windows. We observe as expected that the volume of shifted bytes de-
creases as the window size becomes larger, since fewer ﬂows cross window boundaries.
In agreement with Figures 5, the amount of shifted bytes is smaller for the website,
larger for the 1st month of the campus trace and even larger for the 2nd month. In addi-
tion, in Table 1 we mark the fraction of the total trafﬁc that was shifted to a neighboring
window. The trafﬁc fraction is as large as 35.3% indicating that the effect of Figure 4
can be prevalent leading to signiﬁcant distortion of a ﬂow-based trafﬁc signal.

4.2 Analysis
We further investigated the traces to understand the reasons leading to the three distinct
behaviors illustrated in the above ﬁgures. Figures 5(b) and 5(c) correspond to two con-
secutive months in the same network and the signiﬁcant difference in the second month
worthed further examination. Our investigation revealed during a period of a week in
the second month hourly large trafﬁc spikes that persisted even during low-volume pe-
riods, like nights and weekends. Figure 6 compares the trafﬁc patterns in the week with
the spikes with another week in the ﬁrst month of the trace. The periodic (hourly) spikes

shown in Figure 6(b) are ranked in the top 5% of the monthly samples. Without ﬂow
aggregation they increase the 95-percentile, however, with ﬂow aggregation the spikes
are smoothed and therefore do not signiﬁcantly affect the 95-percentile.
On the other hand, the high agreement between the packet and ﬂow-based curves in
Figure 5(a) results from the distinct properties of the trace. In particular, the website
trace includes mainly short-lived http ﬂows, which are less susceptible to the effect of
Figure 4 than the more diverse set of trafﬁc ﬂows encountered in the campus network.
For this reason, we only observe very few bytes shifted between windows in Table 1.
In summary, our analysis illustrates that ‘horizontal” aggregation due to ﬂow ac-
counting skews the computed 95-percentile. The (lack of) decrease/increase on the 95-
percentile depends signiﬁcantly on the individual characteristics of the examined trafﬁc
traces and ranges from a 2.89% increase to a 9.3% decrease.
5 Discussion and Conclusions
In this work, we used a large set of data to study the widely-used 95-percentile billing
method. We make a number of observations: 1) for medium and high-volume trafﬁc
rates the 95-percentile typically decreases as the aggregation window size increases; 2)
more complex relations between the window size and the 95-percentile are possible;
3) the observed 95-percentile ﬂuctuations were signiﬁcant only for medium and small-
volume trafﬁc rates and rather negligible for high-volume sites; 4) ﬂow aggregation
can skew the computed 95-percentile value causing in our data a decrease up to 9.3%.
Besides, we used certain properties of Internet trafﬁc to justify our observations and
provide a mathematical basis.
A natural question to ask is how to compute the 95-percentile correctly? One could
make the assumption that the trafﬁc rate is a continuous signal and could try to ﬁnd the
95-percentile of the continuous signal. In this case, the 95-percentile would be well-
deﬁned. In our early work, we experimented with trying to ﬁnd an “ideal” 95-percentile
of an assumed underlying continuous signal. However, it turned out that the Fourier
spectrum of network trafﬁc has many high frequency components, which by the well-
known standard Shannon sampling theorem would require sampling network trafﬁc
with a very high frequency or equivalently aggregating network trafﬁc using a very
small window. Such a “correct” 95-percentile, therefore, would be impossible to com-
pute in practice due to the high measurement and instrumentation overhead it would
require.
One take-away of our work is that providers should all use a ﬁxed, ideally stan-
dardized, window size to charge their customers, in order to enable a fare comparison
between different billing rates. This might be already happening to a certain extent, as
the 5-minute window size is popular. However, not everybody uses the same window
size and more importantly the over-charging consequences of varying the window size
were not known, to the best of our knowledge, before our work.
A second take-away of our work is that “horizontal” aggregation introduced by ﬂow
accounting can skew the number of bytes during a window interval, which, in turn, can
bias the computation of the 95-percentile. This observation is signiﬁcant, as ﬂow tech-
nologies are widespread for billing. A possible simple solution to this problem is to have
216
X. Dimitropoulos et al.
synchronized routers/switches that at ﬁxed timestamps, e.g., at 16:00, 16:05, ..., expire
ﬂows. This aligns ﬂow durations within the aggregation window intervals and, there-
fore, the described byte-shifting effect is avoided. This approach, if not implemented
intelligently, however, could lead to ﬂow export synchronization problems.
Summing up, in the future we would like to understand better the properties of
network trafﬁc that affect the computed 95-percentile from ﬂow data. An important
challenge is collecting long, i.e., ideally at least one month long, tcpdump traces from
different networks. In addition, a model of the byte-shifting process described in
Section 4 could have several applications, like in predicting 95-percentile changes or
in reconstructing accurate trafﬁc time series from ﬂow data.
