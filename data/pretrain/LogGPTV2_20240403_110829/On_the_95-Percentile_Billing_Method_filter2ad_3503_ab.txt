### 95-Percentile Billing Method: Analysis and Observations

#### 3. Rank Correlation with Traffic Burstiness
Figure 3 illustrates the rank correlation between traffic burstiness, measured as the relative standard deviation (RSD) of the traffic rate distribution, and the maximum 95-percentile fluctuation across different sites.

**Key Observations:**
- For sites and networks with high and medium traffic rates, the 95-percentile follows a noisy decreasing trend as the aggregation window size increases. This trend can be modeled as a polynomial decrease.
- Fluctuations in the computed 95-percentile due to the size of the aggregation window are more pronounced in low and medium-volume traffic mixes, while they are negligible in high-volume mixes. Traffic burstiness is indicative of how susceptible the 95-percentile is to these fluctuations.

#### 4. 95-Percentile from Flow Data

##### 4.1 Measurements
NetFlow data are commonly used for billing individual sites in web-hosting environments. NetFlow aggregates packets into flows and reports attributes such as duration, size, and timestamps. The 95-percentile is then computed by uniformly distributing the flow size over its lifespan and summing the contributions of all flows within each aggregation window. This "horizontal" aggregation can shift bytes between neighboring windows, potentially skewing the estimated traffic volume and the computed 95-percentile.

**Figure 4** illustrates the effect of flow aggregation on the observed traffic volume during a time interval.

To investigate the impact of flow aggregation on the 95-percentile, we used tcpdump traces. We first computed the 95-percentiles from packet-level data, which do not suffer from the issues discussed above. Next, we grouped packets into flows using the standard five-tuple flow definition and computed the contribution of each flow to each window. The resulting time series were skewed due to flow aggregation.

**Figure 5** shows the 95-percentile versus the window size for both packet and flow-based data using tcpdump traces from an individual website and an enterprise campus network. The plots exhibit three distinct behaviors:
- **Figure 5(a):** The curves for packet and flow-based data are almost indistinguishable, indicating negligible artifacts from flow aggregation. The maximum increase in the 95-percentile for window sizes between 30 and 400 seconds is only 0.42%.
- **Figure 5(b):** Small differences are observed between the packet and flow-based curves. For a window size of 300 seconds, the 95-percentile increases by 1%, with a maximum increase of 2.89% for window sizes above 30 seconds.
- **Figure 5(c):** A significant decrease in the flow-based 95-percentile is evident, consistent across all window sizes, with a maximum decrease of 9.3% at a window size of 200 seconds. At the commonly used 300-second window size, the decrease is 5.8%.

**Table 1** summarizes the total traffic volume shifted between windows due to the effect illustrated in Figure 4. As expected, the volume of shifted bytes decreases as the window size increases, since fewer flows cross window boundaries. The fraction of total traffic shifted to neighboring windows can be as high as 35.3%, indicating that the effect of flow aggregation can significantly distort the flow-based traffic signal.

##### 4.2 Analysis
We further analyzed the traces to understand the reasons behind the three distinct behaviors. Figures 5(b) and 5(c) correspond to two consecutive months in the same network, with significant differences in the second month. Our investigation revealed large hourly traffic spikes during a week in the second month, even during low-volume periods like nights and weekends. **Figure 6** compares the traffic patterns in the week with spikes to another week in the first month of the trace. These periodic spikes, ranked in the top 5% of monthly samples, increase the 95-percentile without flow aggregation but are smoothed out with flow aggregation, leading to a lower 95-percentile.

The high agreement between packet and flow-based curves in Figure 5(a) is due to the short-lived HTTP flows in the website trace, which are less susceptible to the effects of flow aggregation. Consequently, very few bytes are shifted between windows, as shown in Table 1.

In summary, our analysis shows that "horizontal" aggregation due to flow accounting can skew the computed 95-percentile. The degree of this skew varies significantly based on the characteristics of the traffic traces, ranging from a 2.89% increase to a 9.3% decrease.

#### 5. Discussion and Conclusions
In this work, we used a large dataset to study the widely-used 95-percentile billing method. Our key observations include:
1. For medium and high-volume traffic rates, the 95-percentile typically decreases as the aggregation window size increases.
2. More complex relationships between the window size and the 95-percentile are possible.
3. Significant 95-percentile fluctuations are observed only for medium and small-volume traffic rates, while they are negligible for high-volume sites.
4. Flow aggregation can skew the computed 95-percentile, causing up to a 9.3% decrease in our data.

We also explored the properties of Internet traffic to justify our observations and provide a mathematical basis. One potential approach to computing the 95-percentile correctly is to assume the traffic rate as a continuous signal. However, this would require very high-frequency sampling, making it impractical.

**Recommendations:**
- Providers should use a fixed, ideally standardized, window size for billing to enable fair comparisons between different rates.
- Synchronized routers/switches that expire flows at fixed timestamps can align flow durations within aggregation windows, mitigating the byte-shifting effect. However, this approach must be implemented carefully to avoid synchronization problems.

Future work will focus on better understanding the properties of network traffic that affect the 95-percentile from flow data and developing models to predict 95-percentile changes or reconstruct accurate traffic time series from flow data.
