uses the training sets to represent the behavior of legiti-
mate traﬃc. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test then measures
the distance between the test sample and the training set.
The entropy and corrected conditional entropy tests use the
training sets to determine bin ranges, based on equiproba-
ble binning. These tests do not require a priori binning, but
doing so improves performance, as the data does not need
to be partitioned online.
4.1.2 Detection Methodology
In our experiments, we run detection tests on samples of
covert and legitimate traﬃc. We use the resulting test scores
to determine if a sample is covert or legitimate as follows.
First, we set the targeted false positive rate at 0.01. To
achieve this false positive rate, the cutoﬀ scores—the scores
that decide whether a sample is legitimate or covert—are set
at the 99th or 1st percentile (high scores or low scores for
diﬀerent tests) of legitimate sample scores. Then, samples
with scores worse than the cutoﬀ are identiﬁed as covert,
while samples with scores better than the cutoﬀ are identi-
ﬁed as legitimate. The false positive rate is the proportion
of legitimate samples that are wrongly identiﬁed as covert,
while the true positive rate is the proportion of covert sam-
ples that are correctly identiﬁed as covert.
Considering the properties of the detection tests, we can
classify them as tests of shape or regularity. The shape of
traﬃc is described by ﬁrst-order statistics, and the regular-
ity of traﬃc is described by second or higher-order statistics.
The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and entropy test are tests of
shape, while the regularity test and corrected conditional
entropy test are tests of regularity. The test scores are in-
terpreted as follows.
In the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, we measure the distance
between the test sample and the training set that represents
legitimate behavior. Thus, if the test score is small, it im-
plies that the sample is close to the normal behavior. How-
ever, if the sample does not ﬁt the normal behavior well, the
test score will be large, indicating the possible occurrence of
a covert timing channel. By contrast, in the regularity test,
we measure the standard deviation of the standard deviation
of sets of 100 packets. If the regularity score is low, then the
sample is highly regular, indicating the possible existence of
a covert timing channel.
The entropy test estimates the ﬁrst-order entropy, whereas
the corrected conditional entropy test estimates the higher-
order entropy. The entropy test is based on the same al-
gorithm as the corrected conditional entropy test. The cor-
rected conditional entropy test uses Q = 5, whereas the
entropy test uses Q = 65, 536 and m ﬁxed at 1. With m
ﬁxed at 1, the corrected and conditional components of the
algorithm are no longer factors.
If the entropy test score
is low, it suggests a possible covert timing channel, because
the sample does not uniformly ﬁt the appropriate distribu-
tion. If the conditional entropy test score is lower or higher
than the cutoﬀ scores, it suggests a possible covert timing
channel. When the conditional entropy test score is low, the
sample is highly regular. When the conditional entropy test
score is high, near the ﬁrst-order entropy, the sample shows
a lack of correlations.
4.2 Experimental Results
In the following, we present our experimental results in de-
tail. The four detection tests are: the Kolmogorov-Smirnov
test, regularity test, entropy test, and corrected conditional
entropy test. The three covert timing channels are: IPCTC,
TRCTC, and JitterBug. The experiments are organized by
covert timing channels, which are ordered in terms of in-
creasing detection diﬃculty.
IPCTC
4.2.1
Our ﬁrst set of experiments investigates how the detec-
tion tests perform against IPCTC [7]. IPCTC is the sim-
plest among the three covert timing channels being tested
and the easiest to detect, because it exhibits abnormality in
both shape and regularity. The abnormal shape of IPCTC
is caused by the encoding scheme. The encoding scheme
encodes a 1-bit by transmitting a packet during an interval,
and encodes a 0-bit with no packet transmission. Thus, the
number of 0-bits between two 1-bits determines the inter-
packet delays. If the bit sequence is uniform, then we can
view the bit sequence as a series of Bernoulli trials and, thus,
the inter-packet delays approximate a Geometric distribu-
tion. The timing-interval t is rotated among 40 milliseconds,
60 milliseconds, and 80 milliseconds after each 100 packets,
as suggested by Cabuk et al.
[7], to avoid creating a reg-
ular pattern of inter-packet delays at multiples of a single
t. However, this instead creates a regular pattern of inter-
packet delays at multiples of 20 milliseconds. The regularity
of IPCTC is due to the lack of signiﬁcant correlations be-
tween inter-packet delays. That is, the inter-packet delays
are determined by the bit sequence being encoded, not by
the previous inter-packet delays.
We run each detection test 100 times for 2,000 packet sam-
ples of both legitimate traﬃc and IPCTC traﬃc. The mean
and standard deviation of the test scores are shown in Ta-
ble 1. The detection tests all achieve lower average scores
for IPCTC than those for legitimate traﬃc. The regularity
test has a very high standard deviation for legitimate traf-
ﬁc, which suggests that this test is sensitive to variations in
the behavior of legitimate traﬃc. The corrected conditional
entropy test has a mean score for covert traﬃc that appears
somewhat close to that of legitimate traﬃc, 1.96 for legiti-
mate and 2.21 for covert. However, in relative terms, these
scores are not that close. The mean score for IPCTC is much
closer to the maximum entropy than to the mean score of le-
gitimate traﬃc. The maximum entropy is the most uniform
possible distribution [9]. The maximum entropy for Q = 5
is:
H(X) = Q · 1
Q
log(
) = 5 · 1

Q
log(

) ≈ 2.3219
The corrected conditional entropy score is bounded from
above by the ﬁrst-order entropy. The ﬁrst-order entropy is
then bounded from above by the maximum entropy. There-
fore, the corrected conditional entropy score for IPCTC can-
not be much higher.
As shown in Table 2, the detection rates for IPCTC (i.e.
true positive rates for detecting IPCTC) are 1.0 for all tests
except the regularity test, whose detection rate is only 0.49.
The regularity test measures sets of 100 packets and the
timing-interval t is rotated after each set of 100 packets, so
the regularity test observes three distinct variances and ac-
curately measures the regularity of IPCTC. The problem
though is not measuring IPCTC, but measuring legitimate
traﬃc. The very high standard deviation of the regularity
test against legitimate traﬃc makes it impossible to diﬀeren-
tiate IPCTC from legitimate samples without a higher false
positive rate. Moreover, if we increase the timing-interval
t to greater than 100 packets, the regularity test observes
a diﬀerent number of packets for each t value within each
window, as the sets of t packets overlap with the window at
diﬀerent points, making the test less reliable. However, if we
decrease the timing-interval t to much less than 100 packets,
the regularity test observes a similar number of packets for
each t value within each window and the variance for each
window is similar, which makes the test more reliable.
Still, the main problem with the regularity test is its high
standard deviation for legitimate traﬃc. The regularity test
is very sensitive to outliers in legitimate traﬃc. For example,
if σi is very small, due to a sequence of similar inter-packet
delays, and σj is average or larger, then
is very large,
especially for the values of σi close to zero, which are not
uncommon.
In fact, one such outlier in a sample is more
than suﬃcient to make a covert sample appear to be a le-

gitimate sample. The high variance of the regularity test
demonstrates that it is important to examine more than the
average test score, since the variance and distribution of test
scores are critical to the successful detection of covert timing
channels.
4.2.2 TRCTC
Our second set of experiments investigates how our detec-
tion tests perform against TRCTC [6]. TRCTC is a more
advanced covert timing channel that makes use of a replay
attack. TRCTC replays a set of legitimate inter-packet de-
lays to approximate the behavior of legitimate traﬃc. Thus,
TRCTC has the approximately the same shape as legiti-
mate traﬃc, but exhibits abnormal regularity, like IPCTC.
The regularity of TRCTC, like IPCTC, is due to the lack
of signiﬁcant correlations between inter-packet delays. Al-
though TRCTC replays inter-packet delays, the replay is in
random order, as determined by the bit sequence that is be-
ing encoded, thus breaking the correlations in the original
inter-packet delays.
We run each detection test 100 times for 2,000 packet sam-
ples of both legitimate traﬃc and TRCTC traﬃc. The mean
and standard deviation of the test scores are shown in Table
3. The test scores for TRCTC and legitimate traﬃc are ap-
proximately equal for the Kolmogorov-Smirnov and entropy
tests. These tests strictly measure ﬁrst-order statistics, and,
as such, are not able to detect TRCTC. The regularity test
achieves a much lower average score for TRCTC than that
for legitimate traﬃc, which is due to the similar variance
between groups of packets in TRCTC. However, the stan-
dard deviation of the regularity test is again very high for
legitimate traﬃc and, this time, is high for covert traﬃc as
well. At the same time, the corrected conditional entropy
test gives similar results to those for IPCTC. The corrected
conditional entropy test has a mean score for TRCTC that
appears somewhat close to that of legitimate, 1.96 for legit-
imate and 2.21 for covert. However, if we examine the dis-
tribution of test scores for TRCTC and legitimate traﬃc, as
illustrated in Figure 5, then we can see that, although some
scores are in adjacent bins, there is no overlap between the
distributions. Furthermore, the distribution of legitimate

test scores is strongly skewed to the left, away from the dis-
tribution of TRCTC test scores. The detection rates for
TRCTC, as shown in Table 4, are very low (0.04 or less) for
all the detection tests except the corrected conditional en-
tropy test, which has a detection rate of 1.0. The corrected
conditional entropy test scores of TRCTC are again close to
the maximum entropy, therefore the corrected conditional
entropy test is successful in detecting TRCTC.
4.2.3
Our third set of experiments investigates how our detec-
tion tests perform against JitterBug [20]. JitterBug is a
passive covert timing channel, so no additional traﬃc is gen-
erated to transmit information. Instead, JitterBug manip-
ulates the inter-packet delays of existing legitimate traﬃc.
The timing-window w, which determines the maximum de-
lay that JitterBug adds, is set at 20 milliseconds, as sug-
gested by Shah et al.
[20]. The average inter-packet delay
of the original SSH traﬃc is 1.264 seconds, whereas, with
JitterBug, the average inter-packet delay is 1.274 seconds.
In addition, while 20 milliseconds might be noticeable with
other protocols, SSH traﬃc has a small proportion of short
inter-packet delays, i.e., few inter-packet delays less than
100 milliseconds, which makes JitterBug harder to detect in
this part of the distribution. Therefore, because of having
legitimate traﬃc as a base and only slightly increasing the
inter-packet delays, JitterBug is able to retain much of the
original correlation from the legitimate traﬃc. Moreover,
by slightly increasing the inter-packet delays, JitterBug only
slightly aﬀects the original shape. Thus, JitterBug has sim-
ilar shape and regularity to legitimate traﬃc.
Also JitterBug is very diﬃcult to detect for several other
reasons. From a practical perspective, the machine itself has
not been compromised, so conventional host-based intrusion
detection methods fail. Moreover, the traﬃc is encrypted, so
the contents of the packets cannot be used to predict the ap-
propriate behavior. Additionally, the position of JitterBug,
between the machine and the human, further complicates
detection because of the variation in human behavior, i.e.,
diﬀerent typing characteristics. However, as JitterBug is a
covert timing channel and transmits information, there is
some aﬀect on the entropy of the original process.
