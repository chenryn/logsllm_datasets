ordinary Internet). For instance, the ability of a global adversary—with good resources—
to monitor Tor exit relays (where data leaves Tor to the surface Internet) can reveal the 
identity of Tor users if their activities have been successfully correlated to their entrance 
to the Tor Network (the first relay). To overcome this shortcut, Tor allows its users to have 
their own hidden websites that no one can track. As mentioned, websites hosted on the 
ChApTer 3  The UNderGroUNd INTerNeT

Tor Network are known as Tor services or hidden services and have the .onion extension. 
These sites are accessible only from within the Tor Network. Actually, you can run your 
own using your home computer, but you must know how to avoid revealing your true 
identity. Tor offers instruction on how to configure your hidden website at  https://www.
torproject.org/docs/tor-hidden-service.html.en. The collection of Tor hidden 
websites is part of what is known as the darknet; indeed, the most popular sites within 
the darknet belong to the Tor Network.
Finally, a major drawback with the Tor Network is speed. Tor is notoriously slow. 
This because the traffic needs to go through no less than three relays before reaching 
the destination. Tor will slow down even more when a large number of users are using it 
simultaneously.
 Using the Tails OS
In extremely hostile environments where there is a high risk of intercepting 
communications by outside adversaries, it is highly recommended to use the Tails OS 
for your top-secret communication and offline work. In this section, we will cover how 
to use this OS in some detail, showing you how to use it in both online mode and offline 
mode (offline mode allows you to create and read documents in a secure environment).
As we said in the previous chapter, Tails is a Debian GNU/Linux security-hardened 
OS that routes all network connections through the Tor Network. It comes equipped with 
many applications that are preconfigured with security in mind like the Tor Browser, 
secure IM chat, encrypted e-mail client, and encryption software in addition to its 
productivity applications like the Office suite. Tails is a portable OS that runs from within 
a USB or CD/DVD and loads directly into the host machine’s RAM memory; it leaves no 
traces on the host machine’s hard disk. Upon shutdown, Tails will delete all user files, 
unless explicitly asked not to. Tails can be configured to allow a user to store personal 
documents and program settings (persistent storage).
To install the Tails OS on your USB drive, follow these steps:
 1. Download Tails from https://tails.boum.org.
ChApTer 3  The UNderGroUNd INTerNeT
110
Warning! Before you create the live Tails dVd/USB/Sd card, you should check 
the integrity of the ISo image you have downloaded to ensure your copy of the 
Tails file is genuine. Always download Tails from its official website (https://
tails.boum.org/install/index.en.html). do not download the Tails ISo 
image from any other mirrored location.
 2. Download the Universal USB Installer from https://www.
pendrivelinux.com/universal-usb-installer-easy-as-1-2-3. 
This tool is used to install Tails into a USB stick drive.
 3. Configure the Universal USB Installer as shown in Figure 3-7. You 
should have a USB drive with 8GB of free storage. Finally, click the 
Create button.
Figure 3-7. Installing Tails on a USB stick drive

111
 4. Change the boot sequence of the host computer to start from the 
USB zip drive. Each computer manufacturer has its own method 
to access the BIOS/UEFI; consult its website or computer manual.
 5. Plug in your Tails USB stick and restart your host machine to start 
Tails. If Tails boots successfully, select the first option from the 
menu Tails to boot into the system (see Figure 3-8).
Figure 3-8. Tails boot screen
 6. When the Tails Greeter screen appears (this window allows you 
to select your language preference and keyboard layout), click the 
Start Tails button to access the Tails desktop.
Upon starting, Tails needs little configurations because everything is already set to 
work through the Tor Network (see Figure 3-9). All you need to do is to configure your 
Wi-Fi by entering the access point password; if you are connecting through a cable, no 
configuration is needed.

You just installed Tails in read-only mode—also known as an intermediary. In this 
mode of installation, you will not benefit from important features such as automatic 
security upgrades or the ability to store some of your documents and configurations 
in encrypted storage. In the coming section, we will show you how to install Tails in 
a persistent storage mode so you can keep your program settings, bookmarks, stored 
documents, and notes while conducting your OSINT search activities.
To install Tails as persistent storage, you will need another USB stick with 8GB of free 
storage. Of course, if you are planning to store large files, use a higher-capacity USB drive.
 1. Plug the second USB stick into the computer while the Tails OS is 
still running.
 2. Go to Applications ➤ Tails ➤ Tails Installer to start the Tails 
Installer.
 3. When Tails Installer launches, select the “Install by cloning” option.
 4. Select the second USB drive in the Target Device drop-down list 
and then click Install Tails (see Figure 3-10).
Figure 3-9. Tails desktop showing the Tor Browser launched

 5. A warning message appears informing you that all data on the 
selected drive will get lost. Confirm your action, and Tails will 
begin the installation process, which may last for about three 
minutes.
Now, to access the new Tails, restart your machine while leaving the second USB 
stick plugged in—you should remove the first one. Start Tails as you did before.
To save some of your documents and configurations in an encrypted storage on the 
final Tails USB stick, you need to create an encrypted persistent storage. Follow these 
steps to create such storage. This storage will occupy the remaining space on your Tails 
stick drive.
 1. Go to Application ➤ Tails ➤ Configure persistent volume. Select 
a passphrase to protect your encrypted data within the persistent 
storage.
 2. Click the Create button to begin.
 3. Upon finishing, Tails will ask what kind of files you want to store 
on the persistent volume. We recommend selecting Personal 
Data, Network Connection, GnuPG, and Browser Bookmarks.
Figure 3-10. Select the target USB stick where you want to install Tails with 
persistent storage

114
 4. Click the Save button, and Tails will reboot.
 5. This time, the Tails Greeter screen will ask you whether you 
want to use persistent storage. Click Yes and then enter your 
passphrase.
 6. You can now save your working documents in the Persistent 
folder. To open the Persistent folder, go to Places ➤ Persistent.
Warning! remember two points when working on persistent storage.
• persistent storage is not hidden; if someone captures your Tails 
USB stick, they will be able to read it.
• The persistent storage folder can be opened in another oS; 
make sure to open it on a trusted secure computer to avoid 
compromising the Tails security.
Tails can be used in offline mode without an Internet connection if you want to read 
or create sensitive documents. To start Tails in offline mode, launch Tails. When you 
reach the Tails Greeter screen, in the Welcome to Tails window, click the Yes button. 
Then click the Forward button to enter advanced startup. The advanced startup window 
appears. Go to the bottom of the window and click the “Disable all networking” button. 
Then click the Login button.
 Warning When Using the Tails OS
Tails is an excellent anonymous OS that uses the Tor anonymity network by default, but 
to stay completely anonymous when using this OS, you must be aware of any threats or 
attacks against the Tails OS that may result in your privacy being invaded while using it.
• 
Tails does not protect you against hardware-based attacks: Hardware 
keyloggers and other malicious software that infect the host 
computer firmware can intercept your communications stealthily 
even though you are using Tails.
ChApTer 3  The UNderGroUNd INTerNeT
115
• 
Encrypt everything before sending it through Tor: As we mentioned 
previously, the Tor Network is an anonymous network. The link 
between Tor relays —within the network—is encrypted. However, 
once your data leaves the Tor Network, nothing is encrypted. Tails 
also does not encrypt your data by default before sending it through 
the Tor Network, but it offers ready tools for this task, and you should 
consider using them.
• 
Tails does not clear a digital file’s metadata by default: As mentioned 
in Chapter 2, metadata exists within most digital file types. Make sure 
to clear the metadata of digital files—images, Office files, videos—
before sending them online to avoid revealing your identity.
• 
If you are using Tails and live in an extremely hostile environment, you 
should take extra care when working online by separating your online 
identity into many identities: For example, use separate identities 
when you want to perform multiple actions online such as uploading 
a post to your blog, checking your e-mail, and replying to comments 
on a specific blog or website. To remain anonymous in such cases, 
you should restart Tails after doing each task previously mentioned. 
This will effectively make tracking you by a global adversary with 
great resources extremely difficult.
As an OSINT investigator, it is highly recommended to practice using the Tails OS 
and the Tor Browser before conducting your online investigations.
 Searching the Tor Network
You will not find much useful information—similar to the surface Internet—when searching 
the darknet (Tor Network). This network is mostly directed toward illegal activities, and 
some websites may not always be available. However, it can still contain useful resources 
that can aid you in your online investigation. In this section, we will mention popular 
useful hidden services that can help you to find useful resources in the Tor Network.

 Other Anonymity Networks
Other anonymity networks perform similar roles as the Tor Network. The second most 
popular anonymity network is I2P, covered next.
ChApTer 3  The UNderGroUNd INTerNeT
117
 I2P
I2P stands for the Invisible Internet Project; it was first released in 2003. It is an 
anonymity network like Tor, but it differs from it in many aspects, as you are going to see 
next. Before explaining how to use this network to access the darknet, we’ll first explain 
briefly the technical side of this network.
I2P is a decentralized peer-to-peer (also called client, node, or router) network built 
using the Java programming language. I2P allows you to host websites and access the 
darknet of I2P websites (also known as deepsites, which have an .i2P extension). It offers 
a wide range of applications such as anonymous web hosting, BitTorrent, e-mail, file 
sharing, and much more. In the I2P network, the communication between sender and 
destination—within the I2P network—is completely encrypted. Traffic usually passes 
through four layers of encryption before reaching the destination.
 Using I2P
Now, we’ll begin explaining how to access the I2P network.
Note! To run I2p on your computer, you must have Java already installed on your 
machine because I2p is written using the Java programming language. You can 
download Java from https://www.java.com/en/download/index.jsp.
 1. Go to https://geti2p.net and download the software version 
that matches your current OS.
 2. After installing the software (I2P router), click the “Start I2P 
(restartable)” icon, which will bring up the router console using 
your default browser, which has further instructions to configure 
this network. If the router console does not pop up automatically, 
go to http://127.0.0.1:7657/home to view it.
 3. It may take several minutes before I2P connects successfully to the 
network; a message labeled “Network OK” (see Figure 3-11) should 
appear on the router console. If another error message appears 
instead of it (such as “Network: Firewalled”), you need to check 
your firewall settings to allow a connection to I2P ports. We cannot 
ChApTer 3  The UNderGroUNd INTerNeT
118
describe the reasons /proposed solutions for all possible problems. 
You can always copy the error message and Google it to find the 
appropriate solution. Running I2P inside a virtual machine without 
installing a firewall is another option for non-tech- savvy users.
Figure 3-11. I2P router console view—“Network OK”
 4. Now you need to configure your web browser to use the I2P 
network. We will describe how to do this for Firefox; other 
browsers use similar configurations.
 5. Open Firefox Options ➤ General ➤ Network Proxy (located at the 
bottom of the page) and click the Settings button.
 6. In the Connection Settings window, click the circle next to 
“Manual proxy configuration.” Then enter 127.0.0.1 in the HTTP 
Proxy field and 4444 in the Port field. Enter 127.0.0.1 in the SSL 
Proxy field and 4445 in the Port field. Be sure to enter localhost, 
127.0.0.1 into the “No Proxy for” box. Finally, click the OK button 
to accept the new settings (see Figure 3-12).
ChApTer 3  The UNderGroUNd INTerNeT
119
Warning! Unlike Tor, I2p does not provide a mechanism to hide your entry to 
the I2p network from your ISp and government. however, once the connection is 
established, everything will become completely encrypted and anonymous.
I2p doesn’t go through Tor.
The previous configuration of Firefox allows you to use the normal Internet 
anonymously. In the same way, you can access any website hosted on the I2P 
anonymous network (such websites have a .i2p extension instead of .com or .org).

After successfully connecting to the I2P network and configuring your browser 
properly to use it, you can begin discovering this network. If you are stuck and do not 
know where to start, point your browser to the I2P wiki at http://i2pwiki.i2p.
When you first visit an I2P website, you may receive an error message stating 
“Website Not Found in Addressbook” because you do not have any I2P website 
addresses in your router address book. To solve this problem, you need to click one of 
the jump service links at the end of the page (see Figure 3-13).
Figure 3-13. Accessing an I2P website for the first time—the visited website was 
not found in your router’s address book
Try to click each jump service link (boxed in Figure 3-13) until you find one that 
takes you to the page that allows you to add this website to the I2P router address book 
(see Figure 3-14).

After clicking “Save & continue” in the section “Save {Website Name} to router 
address book and continue to website,” the page shown in Figure 3-15 will redirect you to 
the intended website (ELGOOG.I2P in this example).

 I2P vs. Tor
The main difference between Tor and I2P is how their designers perceived the threat 
model. For instance, Tor was primarily created to allow users to surf the surface web 
anonymously. I2P was created as a stand-alone anonymity network that enables fully 
anonymous communication between two parties within its network.
Tor uses a circuit-switching method to drive its data through the Tor Network, while 
I2P uses the packet-switching model. Circuit switching was originally invented for voice 
communication, and it was less suitable for data transmission. Tor uses a single path for 
data transmission, while I2P uses packet switching, which makes all peers participate in 
forwarding packets across the network. Unlike Tor, I2P uses two routes (tunnel) to direct 
inbound and outbound traffic. This will effectively improve the overall anonymity of the 
system and will make data delivery more flexible as each packet will take different routes 
to reach the destination, unlike Tor packets, which need to travel using a single path in 
both directions (the lifetime of each Tor circuit is ten minutes). I2P is faster when moving 
big files within its network than the Tor Network, which suffers from network congestion 
and service interruptions, as it uses only one route for data delivery.
Tor uses a directory structure to view the overall performance of the entire network, 
as well as gather and report statistics. Tor directories maintain a list of all Tor nodes 
and hosted hidden services on the Tor Network and are placed in the United States and 
Europe. The I2P approach is to use a decentralized peer-to-peer network where there is 
no single point to view the entire network, and each peer (router) locally maintains a list 
of all known routers (relays).
I2P uses Garlic encryption—which is a variant of Onion encryption—where multiple 
messages to different recipients are bundled together. This makes it harder for outside 
adversaries to analyze the traffic flow through the network and will also speed data 
transfer and make it more reliable.
Tor has more exit relays compared to I2P. I2P uses the term outproxy to name its own 
exit relay routers. The number of I2P users is smaller than Tor. This makes the number 
of I2P outproxies considerably smaller than Tor exit relays. This will effectively make I2P 
more susceptible to outside traffic analysis compared with the Tor Network, which owns 
a large number of exit relays.
Tor acts as a proxy server by using Secure Sockets (SOCKS), so any application  
(e.g., web browser, IM chat, or e-mail client) able to use SOCKS can be configured to 
use the Tor software directly. I2P uses its own API that must be implemented by any 
applications wanting to communicate through the I2P network. This makes I2P more 
ChApTer 3  The UNderGroUNd INTerNeT
123
secure and anonymous than Tor as its API is designed specifically for anonymity. 
However, applications should be adjusted to use it, and this is somehow costly and limits 
the number of applications that are ready to use the I2P network.
Finally, Tor is well funded. It has a large user base and more supporters from the 
academic and hacker communities compared with I2P network. This clearly appears 
from its website, documentation, and the other projects currently underway. Tor also has 
an advantage in being written in the C language, making it faster when running on client 
machines than I2P, which is written using Java and consumes more RAM memory.
To conclude, both I2P and Tor are excellent anonymous networks, but the context 
in which they are used determines which one is best in terms of performance and 
anonymity. For instance, I2P is preferred over Tor for hosting anonymous sites and 
for making communications within the I2P darknet as it is faster and gives stronger 
anonymity. Tor is preferred to anonymize your traffic when accessing the surface 
Internet, unlike I2P, which is almost unusable—and risky—for this task.
 Freenet
Freenet is another anonymous network. It is a fully distributed, peer-to-peer anonymous 
publishing network. We will not cover how to use this network like we did with the 
previous ones. However, you can check out http://freesocial.draketo.de for a
