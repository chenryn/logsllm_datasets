health-test
Description Test the status of a device using a configured health monitor.
Syntax health-test {ipaddr | ipv6 ipv6addr}
[count num] [monitorname monitor-name] [port port-num]
Parameter Description
ipaddr Specifies the IPv4 address of the device to test.
ipv6addr Specifies the IPv6 address of the device to test.
count num Specifies the number of health checks to send to the device. You can
specify a number 1 - 65535.
The default count is 1.
monitor-name Specifies the name of the health monitor you want to use, 1-29 char-
acters. The health monitor must already be configured.
See “Config Commands: Health Monitors” on page547 for more infor-
mation about configuring a health monitor.
The default monitor is ICMP ping, which is the default Layer 3 health
check.
port-num Specifies the protocol port to test. You can specify any port 1 - 65535.
The default is the override port number set in the health monitor con-
figuration. If none is set there, then this option is not set by default.
Default See descriptions.
Mode EXEC, Privileged EXEC, and global config
Usage If an override IP address and protocol port are set in the health monitor configuration, the
ACOS device will use the override address and port, even if you specify an address and port
with the health-test command.
Example The following command tests port 80 on server 192.168.1.66, using configured health moni-
tor hm80:
ACOS#health-test 192.168.1.66 monitorname hm80

reply to the previous packet is received.
This is disabled by default.
interface { Use the specified interface as the source of the ping. Use ethernet for ethernet
ethernet port-num interfaces, or ve for virtual ethernet interfaces.
ve ve-num}
By default, this is not set. The ACOS device looks up the route to the ping target in
the main route table and uses the interface associated with the route. (The manage-
ment interface is not used unless you specify the management IP address as the
source interface.)
pmtu Enable PMTU discovery.
repeat {count | unlimited} Number of times to send the ping. You can specify a number 1 - 10000000 (ten mil-
lion), or specify unlimited to ping continuously.

ipaddr | configured on the specified interface (either ethernet port-num or
ethernet port-num | ve ve-num), as the source address of the ping.
ve ve-num}
timeout secs Number of seconds the ACOS device waits for a reply to a sent ping packet, 1-2100
seconds.
The default timeout value is 10 seconds.
ttl num Maximum number of hops the ping is allowed to traverse, 1-255.
The default is 1.
Default See descriptions.
Mode EXEC, Privileged EXEC, and global configuration
Usage The ping command sends an echo request packet to a remote address, and then awaits a
reply. Unless you use the flood option, the interval between sending of each ping packet is
1 second.

Syntax backup log
[expedite]
[period {all | day | month | week | days}]
[stats-data]
{profile-name | [use-mgmt-port] url [password password]}
Parameter Description
expedite Allocates additional CPU to the backup process. This option allows up to 50% CPU utilization to
be devoted to the log backup process.
period Specifies the period of time whose data you want to back up:
• all - Backs up the log messages contained in the log buffer.
• day - Backs up the log messages generated during the most recent 24 hours.
• month - Backs up the log messages generated during the most recent 30 days.
• week - Backs up the log messages generated during the most recent 7 days.
• days - Backs up the log messages generated using days as the interval (for example, specify
5 to back up every 5 days).
The default period of time is one month.
stats-data Backs up statistical data from the GUI.
profile-name Profile name for the remote URL, 1-31 characters.
Profiles that can be used in place of the URL are configured with the backup store command.
use-mgmt-port Uses the management interface as the source interface for the connection to the remote
device. The management route table is used to reach the device. Without this option, the ACOS
device attempts to use the data route table to reach the remote device through a data inter-
face.
url Specifies the file transfer protocol, username (if required), and directory path to the location
where you want to save the backup file.
You can enter the entire URL on the command line or press Enter to display a prompt for each
part of the URL. If you enter the entire URL and a password is required, you will still be prompted
for the password. The password can be up to 255 characters long.
To enter the entire URL, use one of the following:
• tftp://host/file
• ftp://[user@]host[:port]/file
• scp://[user@]host/file
• sftp://[user@]host/file
password Specifies the password to access the remote site.
Default See descriptions.
Mode Privileged EXEC, or global configuration mode
Usage The expedite option controls the percentage of CPU utilization allowed exclusively to the
log backup process. The actual CPU utilization during log backup may be higher, if other
management processes also are running at the same time.
If the ACOS device is a member of an aVCS virtual chassis, use the device-context
command to specify the device in the chassis to which to apply this command.

Example The following commands change the backup period to all, allow up to 50% CPU utilization
for the backup process, and back up the log:
ACOS#backup log period all
ACOS#backup log expedite
ACOS#backup log scp://192.168.20.161/log.tgz
...
Example The following command backs up statistical data from the GUI:
ACOS#backup log stats-data scp://192.168.20.161/log.tgz
NOTE: The log period and expedite settings also apply to backups of the GUI statistical
data.
backup system
Description Back up the system. The startup-config file, aFleX policy files, and SSL certificates and keys
will be backed up to a .tar.gz file.
NOTE: Backing up system from one hardware platform and restoring it to another is not
supported.
Syntax backup system {profile-name |
[use-mgmt-port] url [password password]}
Parameter Description
profile-name Profile name for the remote URL, 1-31 characters.
Profiles that can be used in place of the URL are configured with the
backup store command.
use-mgmt-port Uses the management interface as the source interface for the con-
nection to the remote device. The management route table is used
to reach the device. Without this option, the ACOS device attempts
to use the data route table to reach the remote device through a
data interface.

A10 Thunder Series and AX Series—Command Line Interface Reference
Parameter Description
url The url specifies the file transfer protocol, username (if required),
and directory path to the location where you want to save the
backup file.
You can enter the entire URL on the command line or press Enter to
display a prompt for each part of the URL. If you enter the entire URL
and a password is required, you will still be prompted for the pass-
word. The password can be up to 255 characters long.
To enter the entire URL, use one of the following:
• tftp://host/file
• ftp://[user@]host[:port]/file
• scp://[user@]host/file
• sftp://[user@]host/file
password Specifies the password to access the remote site.
Default N/A
Mode Privileged EXEC or Global configuration mode
Usage If the ACOS device is a member of an aVCS virtual chassis, use the device-context com-
mand to specify the device in the chassis to which to apply this command.
Example This example backs up the system to the /home/backups folder on host 192.168.2.2.
ACOS#backup system tftp://192.168.2.2/home/backups/
The trailing slash (/) at the end of the URL tells ACOS that this is a directory path, and not a file
name. In this case, since no file name is specified, the file name will be automatically
generated by ACOS. This is the recommended method of performing system backups
because the file names are guaranteed to be unique. Your backups may fail if you
accidentally backup to a file that already exists with the same name.
Example This example backs up the system to a file called “back_file.tar.gz” on host 1.1.1.1:
ACOS#backup system tftp://1.1.1.1/back_file
