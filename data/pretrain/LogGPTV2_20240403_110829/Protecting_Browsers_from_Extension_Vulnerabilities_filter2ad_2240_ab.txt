(e.g., arbitrary ﬁle access)
• High: Can access site-speciﬁc conﬁdential informa-
tion (e.g., cookies and password) or the Document Ob-
ject Model (DOM) of all web pages
• Medium: Can access private user data (e.g., recent his-
tory) or the DOM of speciﬁc web pages
• Low: Can annoy the user
• None: No security privileges (e.g., a string) or privi-
leges limited to the extension itself
Results. Of the 25 subject extensions, only 3 require criti-
cal privileges (see Figure 2(a)). Therefore, 22 of the subject
extensions are over-privileged because all extensions have
the privilege to perform critical tasks. Despite the fact that
only 3 need critical privileges, 19 use a critical-rated in-
terface (see Figure 2(b)). An additional 3 use high-rated
interfaces despite needing only medium or less privileges,
meaning that a total of 19 extensions use interfaces that have
broader privileges than they require. Figure 3 shows the de-
tailed results. We summarize these results below:

three extensions that actually require critical privi-
leges.) One extension converts ﬁle types using system
utilities, another runs a user-supplied virus scanner on
downloaded ﬁles, and the third launches a new process
to use the operating system’s shutdown command.
• None of the extensions we studied require arbitrary ﬁle
access. Several extensions access ﬁles selected by a
ﬁle open dialog, and most use ﬁles to store extension-
local data. The download managers interact with ﬁles
as they are downloaded.
• 17 extensions require network access (e.g., observing
network data) and/or web page access (e.g., manipu-
lating a page’s DOM). 10 require network access and
11 require access to web pages. Of the 10 extensions
that require network access, 2 require access only to a
speciﬁc set of origins.
• Nearly all of the extensions require access to an
extension-local preference store to persist their own
preferences, but only one changes global browser pref-
erences (to switch languages).
Discussion. Although every Firefox extension runs with
the user’s full privileges, only three of the extensions we
analyze actually require these privileges. The remaining 22
extensions exhibit a privilege gap: they run with more priv-
ileges than required. Moreover, none of the extensions re-
quire arbitrary ﬁle access and only 70% require network or
web page access. The extension system can reduce the priv-
ileges of these extensions without impacting functionality.
Unfortunately, reducing the privileges of extensions in
the Firefox extensions system is difﬁcult because the Fire-
fox extension API bundles many privileges into a single
interface. This is evidenced by the 19 extensions that use
excessively powerful interfaces: 16 use critical-rated in-
terfaces and 3 use high-rated interfaces without needing
that level of privilege. For example, most extensions use
the preference service to store extension-local preferences.
This service can also change browser-wide preferences and
preferences belonging to other extensions.
We identiﬁed the ﬁle system interface as a common point
of excessive privileges. Most extensions use the ﬁle system
interface, which can read and write arbitrary ﬁles. These
extensions could make use of lower-privilege ﬁle storage
interfaces if such interfaces existed. For example, 11 of the
extensions could be limited to ﬁles selected by the user via
a ﬁle open dialog (analogous to the HTML ﬁle upload con-
trol), and 10 extensions could be limited to an extension-
local persistent store (like the HTML 5 localStorage
API) or an extension-speciﬁc directory. The download man-
agers could also be limited to the downloads folder.
3.2 The Security Lattice
Even if a developer explicitly requests only a small num-
ber of interfaces, other interfaces could be reachable from
that set. For example, a developer might request access
to a low-type object with a method that returns a critical-
type object; even though the developer has not asked for the
critical-type object, it is available. We consider this a form
of privilege escalation. To fully limit the privilege levels of

extensions, we must control these escalation points, either
by adding a reference monitor (e.g., to implement an access
control approach) or by taming the interface (e.g., to imple-
ment an object-capability approach). We analyze a subset
of the Firefox extension API to ﬁnd these escalation points.
In Firefox, extensions and internal browser components
use the same interfaces (known as XPCOM interfaces).
These strictly typed interfaces are deﬁned in a CORBA-
like Interface Description Language (IDL). We analyzed
the XPCOM interfaces from Firefox 3.5 by adding a Dat-
alog back-end to the Firefox IDL compiler. By default,
these interfaces are implemented internally by the browser.
However, extensions can (and do) replace these implemen-
tations. For example, the SafeCache [22] browser extension
replaces the HTTP cache. Regardless of the implementation
of an XPCOM interface, the browser enforces the return and
parameter types declared in the interface description.
We analyze the API for escalation points by organizing
the XPCOM interfaces into a security lattice. We manu-
ally label the severity of 613 interfaces (of 1582 total), in-
cluding all the interfaces used by the subject extensions.
We then automatically compute when an extension with a
reference to one interface might be able to obtain a ref-
erence to another interface by deductive inference on the
types used in the interfaces. Our deductive system is an
over-approximation because we do not consider the actual
implementation of the interfaces. Deductions based on the
handling of input parameters might be overly conservative
because it is not known which methods are called on the
input parameters in the implementation. For example, type
foo has a method that accepts type bar as a parameter.
Type bar has a method getFile that returns a ﬁle type.
We do not know whether an implementation of foo actu-
ally ever calls bar.getFile, but we know it is possible.
interfaces a principal
Deductive System. Our deductive system (see Figure 4)
computes which additional
(the
browser or an extension) can obtain from one interface.
Along with the interface name, the rules track which princi-
pal implements each concrete instance of the interface. We
write ρ (cid:44)→η α when principal ρ has a reference to an in-
terface α implemented by principal η. The deduction rules
then describe various ways a reference to one interface can
lead to a reference to another interface. For example, if ρ
possesses both a method of type α → β implemented by
η and an object with interface α implemented by γ, then
ρ can give the α object to η by calling the method. After-
wards, η will have a reference to an object with interface α
implemented by δ.
One subtle rule in the deductive system is the type
forgery rule. This rule states that every principal can create
an object that implements an arbitrary interface. This rule is
appropriate for XPCOM because an extension can create a
JavaScript object that implements an XPCOM interface by
implementing the requisite methods and announcing sup-
port in its queryInterface method. This technique is
useful to attacks because an attacker can use a “forged” ob-
ject to call a method the attacker could not call otherwise.
Reachability. We computed the security lattice for the
Firefox extension interfaces by implementing our rules in
4.1 Least Privilege
Instead of running with the user’s full privileges, exten-
sions run with a restricted set of privileges. The browser
grants an extension access only to those privileges explic-
itly requested in the extension’s manifest. By requiring ex-
tensions to declare their privileges at install time, an attacker
who compromises an extension is limited to these privileges
at runtime. For example, consider the manifest for the sam-
ple Gmail Checker extension [13]:
{
}
"name": "Google Mail Checker",
"description": "Displays the number of unread
messages...",
"version": "1.2",
"background_page": "background.html",
"permissions": [
"tabs",
"http://*.google.com/",
"https://*.google.com/"
],
"browser_action": { "default_title": "" },
"icons": { "128": "icon_128.png" }
In the example, Gmail Checker needs access to subdomains
of google.com and the tabs API. An extension can re-
quest a number of different privileges in its manifest:
• Execute Arbitrary Code. Although our case study
suggests that a majority of extensions do not require
the privilege to execute arbitrary code, some exten-
sions do require this privilege. To request the privilege
to execute arbitrary code, an extension lists a native
binary in its manifest.
• Web Site Access. Extensions can also request the
privilege to interact with web sites.
Instead of re-
ceiving access to all web sites, extensions designate
which web sites they would like to access by ori-
gin. For example, Gmail Checker requests access
to Google by listing http://*.google.com and
https://*.google.com in its manifest.
If the
extension were compromised, the attacker would not
gain access to https://bank.com.
• API Access. Figure 6 shows how extensions can im-
plement their functionality using the extension sys-
tem. Extensions use standard web platform APIs (e.g.,
HTML5 storage) to access ﬁles, storage, web pages,
and the network. In addition to the usual web platform
APIs, extensions can also request access to extension
APIs, which are grouped according to functionality.
For example, the extension system contains an API
group called tabs for interacting with the browser’s
tab strip (creating tabs, moving tabs, etc.). An exten-
sion is granted access to an API group only if the API’s
group appears in the extension’s manifest.
