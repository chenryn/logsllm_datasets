User: I am very new to Google App Engine and Python. I am building a web application using Python and Django which is based on questions and multiple answers. Once the users are logged in to the website, they will be provided with random questions from a datastore.
What my requirement is, if certain users want to form a group so that they all can get the same random questions at the same time to answer, is this possible? Without forming the group, each user gets different random questions on their end.
Assistant: Yes, this should be possible.  Your solution might look something like this:

A user creates a new group.

You generate some random questions and store them in a list for that group.

More users join that group.
You start showing the questions to the users by selecting the first question in that groups list.
Once all users have correctly answered the question, you remove the question from the groups list and show the next question.
