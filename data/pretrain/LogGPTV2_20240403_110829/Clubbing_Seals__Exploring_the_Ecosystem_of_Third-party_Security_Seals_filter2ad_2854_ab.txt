pet – a task well out of reach of common users of the web.
As such, the vast majority of web users are not able to dis-
tinguish between a website that does not use a third-party
security seal, and one that does but is vulnerable.
2.2 Seal Providers
To discover third-party seal providers, we searched in a
popular search engine for phrases such as “site security seal”
and “site safety seal”. For each result, we manually examined
the website of each seal vendor to ensure that the seal cov-
erage included the detection of vulnerabilities, as opposed
to other types of seals that verify a site’s identity and the
proper use of SSL. Due to the extensive labor involved with
the evaluation of each seal provider and its clients, we lim-
ited ourselves to ten providers of security seals.
Table 1 lists the ten investigated third-party security seal
providers ordered by the number of their clients that we
could discover (we describe the process of client discovery
in Section 3). One can see that the services vary greatly in
terms of popularity as well as in terms of cost. Interestingly,
there seems to be no correlation between the popularity of
a seal provider and the price of seal. Since the two, by far,
most popular seal providers are also two large, recognizable
antivirus companies, it is likely that the popularity of seal
providers is related more to brand recognition and less to
other factors, such as price and word-of-mouth.
Five out of the ten seal providers support malware scan-
ning in addition to vulnerability scanning, yet only one pro-
vides the option of scanning the server for malware over the
FTP protocol. As such, the other services can only discover
malware on the indexable pages and directories of a website.
Only two out of the ten investigated services have the option
of server authentication, i.e., scanning the part of a website
that is behind a registration wall. In these two cases, website
owners can give the credentials of a user to the seal provider
and the location of the login page. This means that the vul-
nerability scanners of the majority of seal providers will not
be able to ﬁnd vulnerabilities and malware that reside on
the authenticated part of a website.
The investigated seal providers exhibit varied behavior
when it comes to how they react in the presence of a discov-
ered vulnerability. The majority of seal providers returns an
invisible image when the client fails to mitigate the vulnera-
bility within the grace period. However, there are two types
of deviation from this behavior: the Norton Secured seal
will always be shown, even when vulnerabilities were found,
and similarly, for SecurityMetrics and TinfoilSecurity, the
seal will also remain visible, but the status page on the seal
provider website will no longer show that there is a passing
certiﬁcation.
Finally, we would like to stress that although security seals
have been around for more than a decade, it is still a mar-
ket that is actively being developed. During the course of
our research, McAfee and Godaddy rebranded their security
seal products. The McAfee SECURE seal, which previously
oﬀered both a malware scan and vulnerability analysis as a
single package, was split and now only oﬀers a security seal
for passing the malware scan. In our research, we evaluated
the combination of the malware scan and vulnerability scan,
as was originally oﬀered. WebsiteProtection, a GoDaddy
product, was rebranded as SiteLock, which most likely re-
ﬂects a change in the third-party that GoDaddy relies on
for their security seal product. As in the case of the McAfee
security seal, our research is mainly based on the original
product that was oﬀered by GoDaddy.
3. ADOPTION
As explained in Section 2.1, when website owners sub-
scribe their websites to seal providers, they are given a small
HTML snippet that they have to include in their websites.
This snippet is responsible for fetching and displaying the se-
curity seal to the visitors of the certiﬁed site. In this section,
920Figure 2: Distribution of seal-using websites in the
Alexa top 1 million websites
we take advantage of this snippet in order to automatically
detect seal-using websites, in an eﬀort to understand the
nature of websites that choose to certify themselves using
security seals.
More speciﬁcally, using a crawler based on PhantomJS,
we performed a shallow crawl of the top 1 million websites
according to Alexa, searching for inclusions of speciﬁc re-
mote images and anchor tags from each of the ten studied
seal providers. To account for seal-using websites that are
not part of the top 1 million Alexa websites, we used some
advanced search features of Google’s search engine, which we
based on the same HTML snippets. For example, the follow-
ing search query site:scanverify.com/siteverify.php re-
turns a list of websites using seals by ScanVerify. Using these
processes we were able to discover a total of 8,302 seal-using
websites.
From the 8,302 websites, 73.64% was part of Alexa’s top 1
million websites ranking. Figure 2 shows the distribution of
these websites across the ranks of Alexa. The distribution
is right-skewed where the usage of third-party security seals
decreases together with the ranking. Our ﬁndings indicate
that websites that are already popular, still choose to use
seals as a mechanism of convincing users that they do take
security seriously.
To identify the nature of these 8,302 websites, we used
TrendMicro’s public website categorization database [31].
Figure 3 shows the ten most popular categories of seal-using
websites. As one can see, the “Shopping” category is by far
the most popular with 35.74% of the entire dataset being
categorized as such. Given the motivation for using third-
party security seals that the seal providers themselves use,
this result makes intuitive sense. Security seals are adver-
tised as capable of increasing a user’s trust for any given
website which, in turn, translates to increased sales. As a
matter of fact, most seal providers’ advertising campaigns
heavily rely on testimonials where existing clients claim to
have seen a signiﬁcant increase of sales (in the range of 5%-
20%) after the adoption of their security seal. As such, shop-
ping websites are the primary target audience for buying
security seals from seal providers. This result is also inter-
esting from a security point of view. Websites belonging to
e-shops are highly dynamic in nature, with frontends and
backends, and various e-commerce modules. As such, their
extended attack surface, together with the prospect of exﬁl-
trating ﬁnancial and personal data upon compromise, make
shopping websites more attractive targets over other cate-
gories of websites, such as blogs and news websites.

4. SECURITY EVALUATION
Seal vendors claim that a security seal increases the trust-
worthiness of a certiﬁed website and leads to increased sales.
In this section, we seek to understand whether a user’s trust
should increase in the presence of a third-party security seal.
In order to assess the thoroughness of service provided
by the ten investigated seal providers, we conducted the
following three experiments. First we compare the secu-
rity practices of seal-using websites to other equivalent web-
sites which do not make use of seals. Second, by obtaining
permission for penetration testing, we investigate whether
a moderately interested attacker would be able to ﬁnd a
vulnerability in a supposedly secure website, i.e., a website
bearing a security seal. Third, we set up a webshop including
multiple vulnerabilities, in order to understand which vul-
nerabilities are discoverable by seal providers and how easy
it is for a vulnerable site to obtain a clean bill of health.
4.1 Comparison to non-certiﬁed websites
When a website uses a third-party security seal, it may
seem reasonable to assume that the administrators of that
website are, in general, interested in the security of their site
and are thus taking all the necessary precautions to secure
their services and protect their users.
In this section, we test this assumption by comparing the
adoption of popular security mechanisms by seal-using web-
sites against the adoption of the same mechanisms by equiv-
alent websites which do not use third-party seals. Next to
security mechanisms we also test for issues that can be de-
tected in a non-intrusive way.
Comparison Dataset
To have meaningful comparisons between seal-certiﬁed and
non-certiﬁed websites, the second set of websites must be
similar to the ﬁrst one, in all matters except for the adop-
tion of a security seal. While this is virtually impossible
to establish from the client-side without full knowledge of
an application’s codebase and environment, we provide an
approximate solution as follows.
For every seal-utilizing website, we attempt to identify
another site of the same category within ten places in the
Alexa ranking of the top 1 million websites. If, for instance,
buyfromhome.com is a seal-utilizing e-shop ranked at the
Alexa RankingNumber of sites0e+002e+054e+056e+058e+051e+0604008001200ShoppingBusiness / EconomyComputers / InternetHealthFinancial ServicesTravelVehiclesSportsEducationEntertainmentNumber of sites050010002000921100th place, we search for another e-shop site either ten
ranks above, or ten ranks below the 100th place. The di-
rection of our search is decided probabilistically using the
probability distribution of a fair coin. As before, the cate-
gories of each site are determined using TrendMicro’s public
website categorization engine [31].
Using this process we were able to match 2,238 seal-using
websites to 2,238 other websites of equivalent rank and cat-
egory that do not use third-party security seals.
Security Indicators
In recent years, as a response to a continuous battery of
exploitations of web application vulnerabilities, browser ven-
dors and the research community introduced a series of client-
side security mechanisms that are today available in the vast
majority of modern browsers. These client-side mechanisms
are usually guided by server-side policies, where the web
server expresses its security desires through HTTP headers
and the browsers are responsible for enforcing them at the
side of the user. In addition, web application programmers
have come up with various “best practices” that should al-
ways be followed, e.g., an anti-CSRF token in all forms.
While the presence or absence of such security mechanisms
does not equate to proof of the presence or absence of ex-
ploitable vulnerabilities, they still can be used as indicators
of the security hygiene of any given website.
In addition,
these mechanisms can be detected in a completely passive
fashion thereby not incurring any unnecessary stress on web
applications. In prior research, Nikiforakis et al. [25] com-
bined some of these indicators in a Quality-of-Maintenance
metric and applied it on servers oﬀering remote JavaScript
libraries. Vasek and Moore investigated whether certain
server characteristics can be used as risk factors for predict-
ing server compromise [32], and found that HttpOnly cookies
can, for some types of compromise, be negative risk factors,
i.e., their presence is correlated more with non-compromised
websites rather than compromised ones.
For our experiment, we searched for the presence or ab-
sence of the following, passively discoverable, security mech-
anisms and best practices:
• HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)
• Secure Cookies
• HttpOnly Cookies
• Content Security Policy (CSP)
• X-Frame-Options (XFO)
• iframe sandboxing
• Anti-CSRF Tokens
• X-Content-Type-Options
• SSL-stripping Vulnerable Form
A brief description of each of these mechanisms can be
found in this paper’s Appendix.
Results
For each of the 4,476 websites, we used a crawler based on
PhantomJS to automatically visit a site’s main page and
ten other pages within the same domain, which were ob-
tained using a shallow crawl. To simplify comparisons, we
counted the present security mechanisms and issues in a

binary fashion.
If, for example, one page of the domain
example.com used an HttpOnly cookie, then we credited the
entire example.com domain with that security mechanism.
Table 2 shows the percentage of security mechanisms and
issues discovered in the seal-utilizing websites and in our
gathered set of equivalent websites. To compare the adop-
tion between our two sets of websites, we conducted a two-
sided hypothesis test for the comparison of two independent
proportions. For each row in Table 2, our null hypothesis
(H0) was that the true proportion of that mechanism is the
same between the two sets, while the alternative hypothe-
sis (HA) was that the true proportions of that mechanism
for the two sets are diﬀerent from each other. The last col-
umn of Table 2 shows the results of each hypothesis test,
i.e., whether the adoption of each mechanism is diﬀerent in
a statistically signiﬁcant way, and reports the p-value of the
hypothesis test. Following standard practices in hypothesis
testing, 0.05 was the cut-oﬀ point for the computed p-value,
over which the null hypothesis is maintained.
As one can see, only one third of the measured propor-
tions were diﬀerent in a statistically signiﬁcant way, while
in two out of the three cases, the diﬀerence was credited
in favor of the websites without security seals. The lack of
more signiﬁcant diﬀerences between the adoption of security
mechanisms can be interpreted as a lack of systematic dif-
ference between the security hygiene of seal-using websites
and the hygiene of equivalent websites that do not use seals.
This, in turn, hints towards the absence of a holistic secu-
rity strategy by the adopters of third-party security seals.
In other words, if the intuitive notion that bad security hy-
giene is correlated with increased probability of compromise
is true, seal-using websites are not more secure than their
non-seal equivalents.
4.2 Penetration Testing
Security seal providers claim to protect websites by peri-
odically scanning for the presence of thousands of vulner-
abilities. One could assume that this would result in the
detection of most easily discoverable vulnerabilities, thus
making the discovery of a vulnerability by an attacker, a
long and arduous task.
922To test this hypothesis, we contacted 1,000 seal-using web-
sites asking for explicit permission to conduct a manual pen-
etration test. While the vast majority of websites never re-
sponded to our request, nine websites granted us permission
to proceed. In order to avoid bias in our experiment we sim-
ulated a moderately motivated attacker who only has eight
hours (one working day) to ﬁnd a vulnerability before pro-
ceeding to the next target.
In our manual penetration test, we evaluated websites for
