 Why are games cracked?
 Q&A
Disc Layout Protection
•Games distributed on floppy disc
•Easy to duplicate
•Use Unique disc layout
•E.g. change sector/track markings
•Requires custom reading method
•Failure prevents loading
•Broken through nibble copy
“Feelies”
•Use external token to confirm ownership
•E.g. physical dongle
•Failure prevents launching
•Broken through game code modification
•Use user-based challenge/response
•E.g. code wheel, handbook, etc
•Failure stops game/changes behavior
•Broken through (over time much less) 
painstaking token duplication
 Could be nice game add-ons
 Effective as long as token is hard to copy
 Now outdated due to easy digitalization & Internet
CD Layout Protection
• Games distributed on CDs
• Same old problems
• Break Red Book standard
• Broken sectors, oversized disc
• Prevents standard copy 
procedure
• Failure prevents loading
• Broken through error-resilient 
hardware, advanced nibble copy 
Registration Key
• Use of key value to confirm 
ownership
• Derived through cryptographic 
algorithm
• Required for installation, 
multiplayer features
• Broken through reverse-
engineering, online databases
• Still the first defense
Code Obfuscation
•All copy protection is useless if 
game code can be changed
•Obfuscate binaries
•Pre-2000 mostly custom 
solutions
•Post-2000 added as middleware 
(system components)
•De-obfuscation & patch possible 
(cracks)
Networked DRM
•Cracks are surprisingly effective
•Combine disc layout, registration 
key, code obfuscation
•Added online registration 
requirement, often limits number 
of installs
•Can still be removed, but raises 
the bar
Social DRM
•Eliminates physical 
distribution, downloads only
•Content protection built-in
•Adds:
•user identity
•payment information
•social network
•online requirement
DLC
•Additional game content for 
purchase
•Tied to game registration and 
user account
•Obfuscation
•StarForce
•CD Copy
•CD Checks
•LaserLock
•Mixed
•SafeDisc
•DiscGuard
•SecuROM
•FADE
•Current
•TAGES
•SecuROM
•StarForce
•Next-gen
•“EA DRM”
•“Ubisoft DRM”
•Content Delivery
•Steam
•GfW Live
•BattleNet
•Stardock
•Walled Garden
•iPhone
•Xbox Live
•PS Network
•Intended to protect 
game from duplication
•CD/DVD layout
•Code obfuscation
•Registration key
•Added as middleware 
and system 
components
◦ Intended to prevent local copies
◦ Never leaves the local system
 Might modify the local OS,
install drivers, etc.
 Stores data locally
◦ Advances in computing and technology break copy 
protection
 Digital Reproduction
 Binary analysis technology
 Hardware
 Internet
 …
◦ Copy protection relies on error-case functionality
 Removal is possible
•“…technology that 
inhibits uses of digital 
content not desired or 
intended by the 
content provider...”*
•Combine disc layout, 
registration key, code 
obfuscation
•Online registration 
requirement, often 
limits number of 
installs
◦ Intended to monitor proper usage
◦ In terms of privacy:
 Unique Machine Identification/User ID
 Machine Fingerprint
 Exposes usage over the network
 Install/Startup: when is user starting a game?
 Runtime: when is user playing a game?
 Next big thing: content execution
 All other security concerns
*Wikipedia
◦ SecuROM DRM
 Requires online registration on install
 Installation limit – no uninstall tool (3x)
 “Phones home”
◦ September 2008
 "Most pirated Game ever”
 Available on BitTorrent before release
 downloaded >500,000 times
 90% 1-Star ratings on Amazon
 DRM binaries remain on disc after uninstall
◦ December 2008
 Uninstall tool released
◦ TAGES DRM
 Requires online registration on install
 Installation limit (5x)
◦ December 2009
 Servers overwhelmed by Steam sale
 Most legal installations fail during
the holidays
◦ “Ubisoft DRM”
 Requires permanent network connection
 Reset to checkpoint on disconnect
 Tied to user account
 Stores saved games in the cloud
◦ March 2010
 Authentication server failures
 10+hrs offline
 Single player users locked out
 “95% of players were not affected”
 Cloud saves often fail
 Patched quickly
 Resume gameplay after connection is restored
 Local saves are allowed
◦ “Ubisoft DRM”
 Requires permanent network connection
 Tied to user account
 Stores saved games in the cloud 
◦ April 2010
 Authentication server failures
 Players unable to run game
 50,000 posts in forum
 MP reported nearly unplayable
 Patched with little effect
◦ June 2010
 Australian players locked out at release time
 Futile Attempts
◦ Games will continue being cracked
 Persistent connection to Ubisoft DRM server
◦ Port 80 (tunneling possible), TCP, encrypted
◦ Required for single player
◦ Failure when connection interrupted
 High drop rate can be an issue
 Unreliable routers
 Able to track all game usage
◦ Especially on wireless networks
•Social Network
•“Achievements”
•Game History
•Content Delivery
•Payment
•Built-in content 
protection
◦ Still intended to monitor proper usage
 …but be social too
◦ In terms of privacy:
 All from before
 User account information
 Personal Information (address, DOB (!), …)
 Payment information
 Need to pay for this somehow…

 Exposes a bit too much information?
 Account needed for install
◦ Naturally necessary World of Warcraft
◦ Now for other games
 StarCraft II
 Diablo III
◦ Was also considered for official forum posts
 Not needed for single player
◦ But: “…you don't get access a lot of the stuff."
 Let’s walk through the sign-up…
 Network connection can be limited
◦ Anti-Virus and Firewalls can interfere
◦ Connection bandwidth too small
◦ Connection not reliable enough
 Can be directly attacked
◦ Local network traffic saturation
◦ Wireless traffic injection/interference
◦ Server DDoS attack
 See Ubisoft DDoS attack (March 2010)
 Registration keys are vulnerable
◦ Steal registration key and post publicly
◦ Worse: Key generator could generate valid key
 Both lead to perma-ban (how to fight?)
 Accounts are vulnerable too
◦ Passwords can be guessed
 Security is improving
 WoW players have become paranoid
◦ Reset questions can be guessed
 You linked to your Facebook profile, remember?
◦ Can initiate false “my account has been compromised”
 Will be painful…
◦ Accounts can be compromised at the provider’s side
 Not publicly admitted
 Local Method:
◦ Saturate wireless network router/inject packets
 Router failure is only a matter of time
◦ Wireless dissasociation attack
 Resets connection at the wireless layer
 Remote Method:
◦ Dump traffic on remote target
 Reduces bandwidth, router failure is likely
◦ TCP reset attack
 Resets connection at the TCP layer
◦ SSL replay reset attack
 Resets connection at the SSL layer
 configuration dependent
 Ultimate result:
 Quick answer:
◦ Free stuff is always good
 It is more complex:
◦ DRM can be a severe nuisance
 Cracked games are often easier to use
 Might not be able to play when I really want
◦ Privacy/Policy concerns
 This is making a lot of gamers worry…
◦ What to do if DRM servers go offline for good?
 Gamers like to play old games
