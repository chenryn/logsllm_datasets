At our company we started to use `deno` as an alternative to `make` and `bash`
to provide and run build-scripts for multiple projects. Each project contains
an `aid.ts` file in its root which provides a micro-CLI using docopt. So far
this works nicely.
To make the `aid.ts` files executable from the command line we use this
shebang (works on Linux and Mac):
    #!/bin/sh
    ":" //; exec deno run -A --allow-run --unstable --allow-env --allow-write=.local/ --allow-read "$0" "$@"
A user can access the CLI like this: `aid.ts arg1 arg2 ...`
I would love to remove the `.ts` file extension so that a user can run the
tools via `aid arg1 arg2...`, but as far as I can tell this doesn't work right
now. When I remove the extension, deno will interpret the `aid` file as
JavaScript and complain.
I think it would be nice if deno offered a way to run such executables without
extension. I guess a simple `--ts` flag for `deno run` would suffice. What do
you think? :-)
