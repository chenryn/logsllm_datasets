At our company, we have started using `deno` as an alternative to `make` and `bash` for providing and running build scripts across multiple projects. Each project contains an `aid.ts` file in its root directory, which serves as a micro-CLI using `docopt`. This setup has been working well so far.

To make the `aid.ts` files executable from the command line, we use the following shebang, which is compatible with Linux and macOS:
```sh
#!/bin/sh
":" //; exec deno run -A --allow-run --unstable --allow-env --allow-write=.local/ --allow-read "$0" "$@"
```

Users can access the CLI by running `aid.ts arg1 arg2 ...`.

We would like to remove the `.ts` file extension so that users can run the tool simply as `aid arg1 arg2 ...`. However, when we remove the extension, `deno` interprets the `aid` file as JavaScript, leading to errors.

It would be beneficial if `deno` provided a way to run such executables without requiring a file extension. A simple `--ts` flag for `deno run` could potentially address this issue. What are your thoughts on this? ðŸ˜Š
