### prndrvr

**Applies to:**
- Windows Server 2022
- Windows Server 2019
- Windows Server 2016
- Windows Server 2012 R2
- Windows Server 2012

**Description:**
The `prndrvr` command is a Visual Basic script located in the `%WINdir%\System32\printing_Admin_Scripts\` directory. It allows you to add, delete, and list printer drivers. To use this command at a command prompt, type `cscript` followed by the full path to the `prndrvr` file, or change directories to the appropriate folder. For example:
```cmd
cscript %WINdir%\System32\printing_Admin_Scripts\en-US\prndrvr
```
If used without parameters, `prndrvr` displays command-line help.

**Syntax:**
```cmd
cscript prndrvr {-a | -d | -l | -x | -?} [-m <driver_name>] [-v {0|1|2|3}] [-e <environment>] [-s <server>] [-u <username> -w <password>] [-h <driver_path>] [-i <inf_file>]
```

**Parameters:**

- **-a**: Installs a driver.
- **-d**: Deletes a driver.
- **-l**: Lists all printer drivers installed on the specified server. If no server is specified, it lists the printer drivers installed on the local computer.
- **-x**: Deletes all unused printer drivers and additional printer drivers not in use by a logical printer on the specified server. If no server is specified, it deletes all unused printer drivers on the local computer.
- **-m <driver_name>**: Specifies the name of the driver you want to install. Drivers are often named for the model of printer they support. See the printer documentation for more information.
- **-v {0|1|2|3}**: Specifies the version of the driver you want to install. If no version is specified, the version appropriate for the version of Windows running on the computer where you are installing the driver is used. See the description of the `-e` parameter for information on which versions are available for which environment.
- **-e <environment>**: Specifies the environment for the driver you want to install. If no environment is specified, the environment of the computer where you are installing the driver is used. Supported environments are: `Windows NT x86`, `Windows x64`, and `Windows IA64`.
- **-s <server>**: Specifies the name of the remote computer that hosts the printer you want to manage. If no server is specified, the local computer is used.
- **-u <username> -w <password>**: Specifies an account with permissions to connect to the computer that hosts the printer you want to manage. All members of the target computer's local Administrators group have these permissions, but the permissions can also be granted to other users. If no account is specified, you must be logged on under an account with these permissions for the command to work.
- **-h <driver_path>**: Specifies the path to the driver file. If no path is specified, the path to the location where Windows was installed is used.
- **-i <inf_file>**: Specifies the complete path and file name for the driver you want to install. If no file name is specified, the script uses one of the inbox printer `.inf` files in the `inf` subdirectory of the Windows directory. If the driver path is not specified, the script searches for driver files in the `driver.cab` file.
- **-?**: Displays help at the command prompt.

**Remarks:**
- If the information you supply contains spaces, use quotation marks around the text (for example, `"Computer Name"`).
- The `-x` parameter deletes all additional printer drivers (drivers installed for use on clients running alternate versions of Windows), even if the primary driver is in use. If the fax component is installed, this option also deletes fax drivers. The primary fax driver is deleted if it is not in use (i.e., if there is no queue using it). If the primary fax driver is deleted, the only way to re-enable fax is to reinstall the fax component.

**Examples:**

1. To list all drivers on the local `\printServer1` server:
   ```cmd
   cscript prndrvr -l -s \printServer1
   ```

2. To add a version 3 Windows x64 printer driver for the "Laser printer model 1" using the `c:\temp\Laserprinter1.inf` driver information file for a driver stored in the `c:\temp` folder:
   ```cmd
   cscript prndrvr -a -m "Laser printer model 1" -v 3 -e "Windows x64" -i c:\temp\Laserprinter1.inf -h c:\temp
   ```

3. To delete a version 3 Windows x64 printer driver for "Laser printer model 1":
   ```cmd
   cscript prndrvr -d -m "Laser printer model 1" -v 3 -e "Windows x64"
   ```
