User: When using virtualenv I find that the command: virtualenv -p python2.6 --no-site-packages ~/env/NEW_PROJECT  works without any problems, however if I try to do  virtualenv -p python2.4 --no-site-packages ~/env/NEW_PROJECT I receive the error "The executable python2.4 (from --python=python2.4) does not exist. Is there a way to setup a virtualenv with python2.4?
Thanks
Assistant: The support for python2.4 was dropped in virtualenv 1.8 therefore make sure you use virtualenv<=1.7.2.
