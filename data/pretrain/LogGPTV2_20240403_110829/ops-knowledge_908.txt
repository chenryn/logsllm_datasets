User:  Please introduce commonly used version control tools, how to use version control tools to manage development projects?
Assistant: Commonly used version control tools mainly include Git, SVN, and Mercurial. Git is the most popular version control system at present. Its main features are distributed management, fast speed, high flexibility, and support for localized management. Using Git for project management needs to initialize a warehouse first, add the code to be managed to the warehouse, then use the commit command to submit the code changes, and use the push command to push the code to the remote warehouse, which is convenient for multiple developers to collaborate on code. SVN is a centralized version control system. Its main features are easy to use, complete ecosystem, and support for multiple platforms. Using SVN for project management needs to create a warehouse first, submit the code to the warehouse, then use the update command to update the code to the local working copy, and use the commit command to submit the code changes, which is convenient for multiple developers to collaborate on code. Similar to Git, Mercurial is also a distributed version control system. Its main features are easy to learn, easy to use, and cross-platform. Using Mercurial for project management requires initializing a warehouse, adding code to the warehouse, then using the commit command to submit code changes, and using the push command to push the code to a remote warehouse, which is convenient for multiple developers to collaborate on code. Using version control tools can realize project code version management, code collaboration, code backup, code rollback and other functions, improve the efficiency and quality of code development, and reduce the risk of code errors. For specific usage methods, please refer to the official documentation or video tutorial of the version control tool.
