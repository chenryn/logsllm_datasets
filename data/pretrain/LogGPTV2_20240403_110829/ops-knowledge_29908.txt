User: I'm checking to see if a directory exists, but I noticed I'm using os.path.exists instead of os.path.isdir.  Both work just fine, but I'm curious as to what the advantages are for using isdir instead of exists.
Assistant: Most of the time, it is the same.
But, path can exist physically whereas path.exists() returns False. This is the case if os.stat() returns False for this file.
If path exists physically, then path.isdir() will always return True. This does not depend on platform.
