User: Does python provide a way to find the children of a child process spawned using subprocess, so that I can kill them properly? If not, what is a good way of ensuring that the children of a child are killed?
Assistant: Not exactly easy, but if your application runs in Linux, you could walk through the /proc filesystem and build a list of all PIDs whose PPID (parent PID) is the same as your subprocess'.
