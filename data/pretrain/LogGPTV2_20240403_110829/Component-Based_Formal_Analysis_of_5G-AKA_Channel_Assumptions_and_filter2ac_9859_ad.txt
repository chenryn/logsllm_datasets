### Metadata for Channel and Component Selection and Analysis

Metadata is essential for the efficient selection and analysis of channels and components. In practice, the `channelname` term specifies which of the two secure channels a rule instantiation considers, such as `seaf_ausf` or `ausf_arpf`. The `SendType` and `ReceiveType` terms contain one of the following strings: `SUPI`, `SEAF`, `AUSF`, or `ARPF`.

This construction ensures that an adversary cannot read or modify the contents of a message (`msg`) sent over the secure channel. Similarly, the sender (`A`) and recipient (`B`) of each message cannot be modified or spoofed by the adversary. According to TAMARIN's semantics, only rules with this fact in their conclusion can produce a `SndS(...)` fact, and only rules with the `RcvS(...)` fact in their premise can consume it. This means the adversary cannot construct these facts themselves.

Assuming all protocol rules are correctly modeled and constructed, i.e., all rules honestly identify the sender and intended recipient, this construction also guarantees the authenticity of the sender and recipient. Note that this construction does not specify which session of the protocol the message was intended for, nor the order in which messages are delivered.

Each `SndS(...)` and `RcvS(...)` fact can only be consumed once as a premise to a rule. Therefore, a message transmitted through this channel cannot be replayed by the adversary. The adversary can only attempt to trigger the original rule that invoked `SndS(...)`, but the rule's premises must be satisfied again before this can occur.

We believe this construction closely matches the "e2e core network interconnection" channel requirements as described in [5, §5.7.4] (cited in Section III-A). Hence, we use it to model channels 2 and 3, i.e., the channels between the SEAF and AUSF, and the AUSF and ARPF, respectively.

### Analysis and Results

In Sections IV and VI, we have described the desired security properties of 5G-AKA both informally and formally, along with the threat model under which these properties are evaluated. Our systematic analysis has allowed us to draw conclusions about which of these properties are upheld. We present our findings for secrecy and authentication.

#### Secrecy Properties:
1. **Secrecy of honest subscriber’s long-term key K:**
2. **Secrecy of anchor keys KSEAF and KAUSF:**

#### Authentication Properties:
1. **SN and UE agree on the identity of UE:**
2. **UE and SN agree on the identity of SN:**
3. **HN and SN agree on the identity of UE:**
4. **UE and HN agree on the identity of HN:**
5. **UE and HN agree on the identity of SN:**
6. **UE, SN, and HN agree on KSEAF:**
7. **Anchor key KSEAF must not be replayable:**

Our results show various secrecy and agreement violations against 5G-AKA. Of particular interest is the attack that violates the secrecy of the anchor key KSEAF. We will discuss this in detail in this section, starting with an informal overview followed by an in-depth description.

### Secrecy Violation

#### Overview
A malicious actor 'B' initiates two 5G-AKA sessions with a local serving network at roughly the same time. One session is initiated by replaying an overheard SUCI (of the target, user 'A'), and the other session is with the malicious actor's own USIM and SUCI (for user 'B'). These sessions run in parallel, resulting in a race condition. If this occurs, the AUSF will be unable to distinguish between the two responses containing the Authentication Vectors from the credential store (ARPF), and may associate the wrong response (and resultant keys) with the wrong user. Consequently, the AUSF and SEAF will incorrectly believe that a set of Authentication Vectors and 'anchor key' were intended for user A (derived from user A's long-term key KA), when they were actually derived from user B's long-term key KB. As a result, the malicious user B will now be able to derive the anchor key and use it to impersonate user A to the network. See Figure 8 for the message sequence chart of the attack.

#### What Does the Secrecy Violation Break?
We now provide a more in-depth description of the secrecy violation.

The specific violated property is the secrecy of the 'anchor key' KSEAF (and its cryptographic parent, KAUSF) from the points of view of the SEAF and AUSF. At the end of the 5G-AKA protocol run:

- The SEAF, AUSF, and a UE will have agreed on the possession of a cryptographic anchor key, KSEAF.
- The SEAF and AUSF believe this key is for an honest and uncompromised UE (in our example, user 'A' with 'SUPI-A' and 'SUCI-A').
- Both the SEAF and AUSF believe this key is secret from the attacker, but it is not.

Thus, the protocol draft lacks a crucial containment property: an attacker who can compromise or gain access to the long-term key of a user (e.g., 'B') will be able to impersonate any user (e.g., 'A') to the SEAF and the AUSF because it knows the KSEAF for a session they believe to be for 'A'.

#### Detailed Attack Scenario
The attack takes place in two (possibly temporally and even geographically) separate phases. In the first phase, the attacker eavesdrops and records a legitimate encrypted/concealed SUPI, also known as a SUCI. In the second phase, the main body of the attack takes place. Full message definitions can be found primarily in TS 33.501 [5] (some are in TS 33.102, [4]). Note that this attack can occur even more easily if the SUPI is transmitted unconcealed, i.e., not encrypted into SUCI form.

**Setup to the Attack:**
1. A legitimate user 'A' with ID 'SUPI-A' is registered with its home network (HN). The attack does not require access to its long-term key KA. This honest user initializes the 5G-AKA protocol, sending the SUCI-A (user A’s ephemerally encrypted SUPI) and 'HN' to a SEAF. The user then completes the protocol as normal.
2. The attacker eavesdrops on the public radio transmissions from the previous step and records the message containing SUCI-A and HN.
3. The attacker purchases a legitimate USIM from the same home network as the intended victim, which has ID 'SUPI-B'. The attacker physically attacks and compromises the USIM, extracting the long-term key KB of this USIM in its possession.5

**Main Phase of the Attack:**
1. The attacker initiates the 5G-AKA protocol by replaying the pre-recorded SUCI-A to a SEAF. The attacker sends a message containing 'SUCI-A' and the name of the user’s home network to a SEAF in serving network 'SNID'.
2. The protocol proceeds as normal: the SEAF communicates with an AUSF in the specified home network by sending the '5G-AIR' message, which contains 'SUCI-A' and SNID.
3. In parallel with the first session, the attacker starts a 5G-AKA session for the USIM it owns (SUPI-B) with the same home network, via the same serving network (and SEAF). It starts the 5G-AKA session by sending its own concealed ID ('SUCI-B') and the name of the home network to the same SEAF as in the other, parallel session. The SEAF correctly treats this as a separate session.
4. The SEAF communicates with the AUSF in the home network by sending the '5G-AIR' message, containing 'SUCI-B' and SNID. The AUSF then sends the 'Auth-Info Request' message to the home network’s ARPF.
5. The SIDF de-conceals SUCI-B into SUPI-B, and the ARPF responds by sending the 'Auth-Info Response' message to the AUSF. This message contains terms derived from (the compromised) KB, and the terms RAND, SQN, and SNID, but notably contains no reference to either the SUPI or the SUCI.
6. The 'Auth-Info Response' message is received by the AUSF, but as this message does not have a SUPI or SUCI attached to it, the AUSF does not know whether this message was for the session with 'SUCI-A/SUPI-A', or whether it was for the session with 'SUCI-B/SUPI-B'. The AUSF can legitimately continue its session intended for 'A' with the 'Auth-Info Response' message that was actually intended for the session with 'B'.
7. The AUSF then proceeds with the protocol, sending the 5G-AIA message for 'SUPI-A' to the SEAF; this contains the anchor key KSEAF that the ARPF generated for 'SUPI-B', but now the AUSF associates it with 'SUPI-A' (and as a result, so does the SEAF). As the attacker has compromised SUPI-B’s long-term key KB (and RAND and SQN are publicly transmitted during the protocol), the attacker can now construct the anchor key KSEAF that the AUSF and SEAF now believe is the anchor key for 'SUPI-A'. That is, the attacker can derive the KSEAF that the AUSF and SEAF believe to be for the (honest) 'SUPI-A' (and not 'SUPI-B' which the attacker has compromised), completing the attack.

**Note:** After discussion with a senior security researcher of a global carrier, we believe that the physical extraction of KB is not necessary, although if this step is completed, it gives the attacker even greater control over the timing and flow of messages.

### Authentication Violations

There are multiple authentication violations, which fall into two categories: authentication of serving network ID and session confusion.

#### Authentication of the SNID
This is a genuine violation of agreement over the identity of the SNID, as the UE never learns this term in an authenticated message. This causes agreement to fail on KSEAF, as this term is derived by the UE from terms including SNID. The ARPF, AUSF, and SEAF will derive an anchor key KSEAF on which the UE will not agree if the adversary has injected an arbitrary SNID into the UE’s (unauthenticated) serving network discovery phase.

This violation was originally discovered in concurrent work by Basin et al. [11]. Our four-party models and analysis confirm the existence of this agreement violation.

The adversary can inject an arbitrary SNID onto the UE ↔ SEAF channel: the UE then has no way of validating the authenticity of SNID. The adversary must block the UE’s Auth-Resp response message, as otherwise a genuine SEAF would quickly discover that the UE-generated HRES* and AUSF-generated HXRES* do not match. As the UE then does not receive any rejection messages from the serving network, it assumes the authentication was successful, and from the UE’s point of view, the protocol is finished. The UE will then attempt to communicate normally with a nearby base station.

Outside of the definition of 5G-AKA, TS 33.501 excludes this 'attack': see Section 5.10, cited in Figure 7. This attempted communication and use of the KSEAF with the wrong SNID after the protocol has finished will fail, but we agree that this attack still violates serving network authentication in the explicit sense. We leave the question of whether this violation would allow the adversary any separate, meaningful benefit for future work. We propose and formally verify a fix for this authentication violation in Section IX-B.

#### Session Confusion
Allowing sessions for different users to be accidentally confused causes the violation of both secrecy and authentication properties. The message flow behind many of the authentication violations is the same as the secrecy violation described in Section VIII-A. Here, session confusion occurs at the same point, i.e., two sets of authentication vectors sent by the ARPF are received by the AUSF at roughly the same time.
