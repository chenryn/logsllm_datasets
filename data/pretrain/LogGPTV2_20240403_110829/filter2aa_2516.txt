## Introduction to Smart Traffic
### Creating a Platform for Information Exchange
- Road signs
- Parking status
- Traffic status
- Traffic light systems
- Road users (cyclists, cars, trucks, emergency vehicles, etc.)

## Our Research Focus
### Facts and Figures in the Netherlands
- Population: 17+ million
- Bicycles: 22.8 million
- Cycling infrastructure: 35,000 kilometers

## Ongoing Partnerships
### Goals
- Safety
- Comfort
- Traffic flow

### Apps to Connect
- **Cyclists:** Decreases the time to green
- **Trucks:** Ensures a smooth green flow
- **Emergency vehicles:** Instant green and notification to other road users

## Transition to Intelligent Traffic Light Control (iVRI)
- VRI (Verkeersregelaar Intersectie) controls all traffic lights at one intersection.
- iVRI (Intelligent Verkeersregelaar Intersectie) is the intelligent version.
- Current deployment: 513 iVRI units across the Netherlands (out of 5,500 total VRI units).

## How Are Things Connected? (Simplified)
- Cloud Services
- Road Users (Current state: Future includes car-to-car, 5G-enabled, etc.)
- ETSI CAM Objects

### ETSI CAM Objects
- **ETSI (European Telecommunications Standards Institute)**
- **ITS (Intelligent Transport Systems)**
- **CAM (Cooperative Awareness Message):** EU standard
- **BSM (Basic Safety Message):** US standard

#### Contents of CAM Objects
- **Basic Container:**
  - Position
  - Station type
- **HF (High Frequency) Container:**
  - High-speed data
  - Speed
  - Yaw
- **LF (Low Frequency) Container:**
  - Static or slow-changing data
  - Lights
  - Path history

### ITS Security
- **Standard:** Describes message signing
- **Station Type:** Included in CAM
- **Certificate:** Contains SSP (Service Specific Permissions) and ITS-AID (Intelligent Transport System Application ID)
  - **ITS-AID:** Describes basic permissions
  - **SSP:** Describes specific permissions (e.g., Emergency container, Dangerous goods container)

**Security Implementation:**
- Requires a central certificate authority and infrastructure
- Monitoring messages sent across the infrastructure is advisable
- Research on detecting abuse: [F2MD](https://github.com/josephkamel/F2MD)

## Real-Life Implementations
### Viewing CAM
- **Android Application for Cyclists:**
  - Decompiled: CAM objects over MQTT
  - ASN and Protobuf used for communication
  - Example CAM publisher function:
    ```asn
    value basicContainer ::= {
        stationType cyclist,
        referencePosition {
            latitude 51xxxxx,
            longitude 50xxxxx,
            positionConfidenceEllipse {
                semiMajorConfidence unavailable,
                semiMinorConfidence unavailable,
                semiMajorOrientation unavailable
            },
            altitude {
                altitudeValue 4000,
                altitudeConfidence unavailable
            }
        }
    }
    ```

### Modifying CAM
- Multiple cyclists can be simulated with new MQTT connections.

### Backend Vulnerability
- **Android Application for Cyclists:**
  - Burp Suite used to intercept POST requests with position data
  - No authentication mechanism to distinguish between cyclists
  - Example request: `[{"heading":, "latitude":, "longitude":, "speed":}]`

## What Could Go Wrong?
- **Key Issue:** Lack of message signing as specified by ETSI standards
- **Potential Impact:**
  - Remotely influence a cycling traffic light
  - Influence all cycling lights in a city
  - Imitate cyclists (for now)
  - Limited impact: safety systems remain intact, but annoyance due to unnecessary red lights
  - Potential for road rage

**Ongoing:** Responsible disclosure process

## Conclusion
### Key Recommendations
1. **Implement Authentication:**
   - Ensure secure communication and prevent unauthorized access.
2. **Monitor Unusual Behavior:**
   - Detect and respond to unexpected or implausible behavior in the backend.
3. **Block Abuse:**
   - Implement measures to prevent and mitigate malicious activities.
