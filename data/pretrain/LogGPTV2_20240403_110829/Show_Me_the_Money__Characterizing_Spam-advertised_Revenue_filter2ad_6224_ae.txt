Table 4: Estimated monthly order volume, average purchase price, and monthly revenue (in dollars) per afﬁliate program using
three different per-order price approximations.
5.2 Revenue
Finally, to place a rough estimate on revenue, we multi-
ply the 2011 order volume measurements shown in Fig-
ure 4 against each of the previously mentioned approxi-
mations, summarized in Table 4. In general, the approxi-
mation from our prior “Spamalytics” study is the largest,
followed by basket-weighted average and then minimum
product price. However, for pharmaceutical programs
the difference between product prices is not large, and
thus the minimum and basket-weighted estimates all lie
within 2X of one another. Software programs see much
more variation in price, and hence the difference between
the minimum and basket-weighted revenue estimates can
be substantial.
Using the basket-weighted approximation, we ﬁnd
that both GlavMed and EvaPharmacy produce revenues
in excess of $1M per month, with all but two over $400K.
Surprisingly, software sales also produce high revenue—
less due to high prices than high order volumes. It re-
mains for future work how to further validate how closely
order volumes track successfully completed orders for
this market niche.
5.3 External consistency
While we put considerable care into producing these es-
timates, a number of biases remain unavoidable. First,
while our order volume data has internal consistency
(and consistency with order number implementations in
common shopping cart software), we could not capture
the impact of order declines. Thus, we have a somewhat
optimistic revenue estimate, since surely some fraction
of orders will not complete.
On the other hand, our estimates of average order rev-
enue are themselves conservative in several key ways.
First, they assume that all purchasers select only a sin-
gle item. Second, they assume that when purchasing an
item, all users select the minimum dosage and quantity.
Finally, for pharmaceuticals we need to keep in mind
that EvaPharmacy does not carry “harder” drugs found
at other sites, such as Schedule II opiates. We have found
anecdotal evidence that these drugs are highly popular
at such sites, but our methodology does not offer any
means to consider their impact. Such items are also typi-
cally more expensive than other drugs (e.g., the cheapest
Hydrocodone order possible at one popular pharmacy is
$186 plus shipping). Thus, this other factor will cause us
to underestimate the true revenue per order.
Our intuition is that such factors are modest, and
our estimates capture—within perhaps a small constant
factor—the true level of ﬁnancial activity within each
enterprise. However, absent ground truth data for pro-
gram revenues, it is not generally possible to validate our
model and hence verify that our measurements actually
capture reality. In general, this kind of validation is rarely
possible since the actors involved are not public compa-
nies and do not make revenue statements available.
Due to an unusual situation, however, we were able
to acquire such information for one program, Rx–
Promotion. In particular, a third party made public a va-
riety of information, including multiple months of ac-
counting data, for Rx–Promotion’s payment processor.11
While we cannot validate the provenance of this data,
its volume and speciﬁcity make complete fabrication un-
likely. In addition, given that our research covers only a
small subset of this data, it seems further unlikely that
any fabrication would closely match our own indepen-
dent measurements.
Unfortunately, we do not have payment ledgers pre-
cisely covering our 2011 measurement period. Instead,
we compare against a similar period six months ear-
lier for which we do have ground truth documentation,
27 consecutive days from the end of Spring, 2010. These
11While our legal advisers believe that the prior public disclosure of
this data allows its use in a research context, we chose not to unneces-
sarily antagonize the payment services provider by naming them here.
two periods are comparable because during both times
Rx–Promotion had signiﬁcant difﬁculty processing or-
ders on “controlled” drugs (indeed, during the 2011 pe-
riod such drugs had been removed from the standard for-
mulary on Rx–Promotion afﬁliates).12
Based on this data, we ﬁnd that between May 31 and
June 26, 2010, Rx–Promotion’s turnover via electronic
payments was $609K.13 Using our estimate of 385 orders
per day in 2010 (see § 3), this is consistent with an aver-
age revenue per order of $58, very similar to our basket-
weighted average order price estimate of $57. While we
suspect that both estimates are likely off (with the num-
ber of true June 2010 orders likely less due to declines,
and January 2011 price-per-order likely higher due to
conservatism in our approximation), they are sufﬁciently
close to one another to support our claim that this ap-
proach can provide a rough, but well-founded estimate
(i.e., within a small constant factor) of program revenue.
6 Conclusion
When asked why he robbed banks, Willie Sutton fa-
mously responded, “Because that’s where the money
is.” The same premise is frequently used to explain the
plethora of unwanted spam that ﬁlls our inboxes, pol-
lutes our search results and infests our social networks—
spammers spam because they can make money at it.
However, a key question has long been how much money,
and from whom? In this paper we provide what we be-
lieve represents the most comprehensive attempt to an-
swer these questions to date. We have developed new in-
ference techniques: one to estimate the rate of new orders
received by the very enterprises whose revenue drives
spam, and the other to characterize the products and cus-
tomers who provide that same revenue. We provide quan-
titative evidence showing that spam is ultimately sup-
ported by Western purchases, with a particularly central
role played by U.S. customers. We also provide the ﬁrst
sense of market size, with well over 100,000 monthly
orders placed in our dataset alone. Finally, we provide
rough but well-founded estimates of per-program rev-
enue. Our results suggest that while the spam-advertised
pharmacy market is substantial, with annual revenue in
the many tens of millions of dollars, it has nowhere near
the size claimed by some, and indeed falls vastly short of
the annual expenditures on technical anti-spam solutions.
12During periods when such drugs were sold en masse, the overall
Rx–Promotion revenue was frequently doubled.
13Interestingly, this data also provides useful information about re-
funds and chargebacks (together about 10% of revenue) as well as
processing fees (roughly 8.5%). Thus, the gross revenue delivered to
Rx–Promotion in June 2010 was likely closer to $489K. Finally, since
roughly 40% of successful order income is paid to afﬁliates on a com-
mission basis, that leaves only $270K (44% of gross) for fulﬁllment,
administrative costs, and proﬁt.
