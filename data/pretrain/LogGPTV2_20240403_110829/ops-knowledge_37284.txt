User: I'm currently trying to run an R script from the command line (my end goal is to execute it as the last line of a python script).  I'm not sure what a batch file is, or how to make my R script 'executable'. Currently it is saved as a .R file.  It works when I run it from R.
How do I execute this from the windows command prompt line? Do i need to download something called Rscript.exe? Do I just save my R script as an .exe file? Please advise on the easiest way to achieve this.
R: version 3.3   python: version 3.x  os: windows
Assistant: You already have Rscript, it came with your version of R. If R.exe, Rgui.exe, ... are in your path, then so is Rscript.exe.
Your call from Python could just be Rscript myFile.R.  Rscript is much better than R BATCH CMD ... and other very old and outdated usage patterns.
