Does anyone thought about adding support for fluent API (something
similar/same as Dart does)?
    class A {
      k = 10;
      constructor(private n) {
      }
      run(): void { ... }
      test(): void { ... }
    }
    new A(2)
      ..k = 20
      ..run()
      ..test();
this could be translated to:
    var a = new A(2);
    a.k = 20;
    a.run();
    a.test();
That would simplify a lot writing A class in a way fluent API is supported.
