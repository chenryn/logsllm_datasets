### Methodology and IP Address Classification

In addition to the previously described methodology, we also utilize a list of servers provided by a large Content Delivery Network (CDN). Based on our confidence in their accuracy, we classify IP addresses into three categories: **IPs-CDN**, **IPs-DPI**, and **IPs-ZMap**. 

- **IPs-CDN**: We have the highest confidence in the accuracy of these classifications, as they are derived from the CDN-provided list.
- **IPs-DPI**: These classifications are based on Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) performed on network traces, providing high confidence in their accuracy at the time of observation.
- **IPs-ZMap**: This dataset comes with the greatest degree of uncertainty but covers a wide range of IP addresses.

It is important to note that the same IP address may appear in more than one of these classification sets.

### 4.3 IP Activity Analysis

**Figure 3(a)** presents a scatter plot for all IP addresses observed in the L-IXP trace. Each IP is plotted according to the number of sampled Web requests it sent versus received on a log-log scale. This plot highlights different classes of IPs:
- **Server-only IPs**: Only receive requests and are scattered along the y-axis.
- **Client-only IPs**: Only send requests and are scattered along the x-axis.
- **Dual-role IPs**: Both send and receive requests and are scattered across both axes.

**Figure 3(b)** shows the cumulative percentage of the number of sampled GET and POST requests issued per IP, sorted by the number of observed requests. A key observation is that less than 1% of all IPs are responsible for more than 30% of all requests across the IXP and backbone vantage points.

From the sampled data, we estimate that the IP contributing the most requests at the L-IXP sends more than 5 million requests per hour on average, while at BBone-2, this number is approximately 310,000 requests per hour. This behavior is indicative of non-human activity, such as a crawler, proxy, or auctioneer.

**Figure 3(c)** illustrates the number of sampled requests each IP sent versus the number of unique destination IPs (fan-out) on a log-log scale. Some clients contact a large number of servers, while others send a high volume of requests to a small set of server IPs. As shown in Table 3, we observe a significant number of POST requests, which can be attributed to the intensive use of Web service protocols like SOAP. Clients with a high number of requests tend to have a higher fraction of POST requests compared to those with fewer requests.

| Name   | L-IXP       | M-IXP     | BBone-1   | BBone-2   |
|--------|-------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| GETs   | 76.36M (71.6%) | 11.5%    | 3.7%      | 2.65M (78.9%) |
| POSTs  | 16.9%       | 17.4%     | 6.5%      | 33.7%     |

### 4.4 CDNs, Proxies, and Other Intermediaries

Typical examples of dual-behavior hosts include proxies deployed by institutions and forward/reverse proxies operated by CDNs and content providers (CPs). However, intermediaries can serve various purposes. For instance, many types of proxies affect a significant number of connections and are not operated by CDNs or CPs. Additionally, intermediaries in hosting or cloud service provider networks may not solely function for request forwarding.

To identify intermediaries operated by CPs or CDNs, referred to as **Content Delivery Proxies (CDPs)**, we follow these steps:
1. Select potential candidates from the IPs-CDN set and heavy-hitters (IPs with more than 5 sampled requests).
2. Check the origin AS of the corresponding subnet and manually inspect WHOIS information to confirm registration to known CPs or CDNs.
3. Verify DNS hostnames and use techniques reported in [18, 56] to attribute IPs to CPs and CDNs.

We identified front-ends of 8 well-known organizations, such as Google, Akamai, Limelight, and EdgeCast, with over 36,000 (15,000) IPs in the L-IXP (M-IXP) traces. We also found CDPs active on transatlantic links, with 9,000 and 19,000 IPs for the BBone-1 and BBone-2 traces, respectively.

### 4.5 Real-Time Bidding (RTB): Auctioneers and Bidders

The bidding process between auctioneers and bidders is typically conducted using Web services like Google AdExchange or Facebook Exchange. Bidders register with auctioneers and provide URIs for receiving offers, responding with bids within a maximum time threshold, often around 100ms.

Auctioneers typically send offers via POST requests to bidders, who in turn receive a large number of POST requests from a small number of hosts. This aligns with our observation of an 80% increase in POST requests over the past three years in L-IXP traces.

To identify auctioneers and bidders, we:
1. Obtain a list of partial URLs sent by heavy-hitters.
2. Select IPs whose HTTP requests contain URL strings like "ad," "bid," or "rtb."
3. Check for fixed structures in the subset of requests and mark these IPs as potential auctioneers.
4. Manually validate these IPs using reverse DNS, WHOIS, and API documentation.

We identified 316 auctioneer IPs and 282 bidder IPs in the L-IXP trace. No bidding activity was detected in the M-IXP or backbone traces, possibly due to high latency in transatlantic links.

### 4.6 Web Crawlers

Web crawlers issue many GET requests to diverse servers and upload results to search infrastructure. To identify crawlers, we:
1. Pre-select heavy hitters in terms of GET requests.
2. Search for hostnames with indicative strings like "bot," "crawl," or "spider."
3. Validate these IPs using reverse DNS and user-agent strings.

We identified 3,920 and 541 crawlers in the L-IXP and M-IXP traces, respectively. Surprisingly, we also found crawlers in the backbone traces: 81 and 894 for BBone-1 and BBone-2, respectively. These included well-known search engines like Google, Bing, Yandex, and Baidu, as well as smaller search engines and research institutions.

### Summary

Our findings indicate that most IPs in the Web ecosystem are clients, but there are substantial numbers of Web intermediaries. By combining passive and active measurements, we discovered that many client IPs also act as servers, increasing the number of dual-behavior IPs. For example, in the L-IXP trace, more than 50% of server IPs exhibit client behavior. We identified activity from content delivery proxies, ad auctioneers, ad bidders, and crawlers in the L-IXP trace, as well as intermediary and crawling activity in other vantage points.

### 5. Web Back Office: A Closer Look

To better understand back-office services, we analyzed the components in the L-IXP trace:

**Auctioneers and Bidders:**
- Identified over 300 auctioneer IPs operated by four organizations: two search engines, an online social network, and a major Web portal.
- The top organization hosts 83% of the IPs and is involved in 55% of the bids.
- Bidders (282 IPs) are co-located with auctioneers, residing in 42 different ASes.
- A large hosting service provider dominates with 34% of the bidders, indicating reliance on cloud and Web hosting companies.

**Crawlers:**
- Identified over 3,000 crawler IPs from 120 different ASes, with two ASes hosting 72% of the crawler IPs.
- Top contributors belong to major search engines, accounting for 94-96% of the requests.
- A single AS receives over 43% of the requests, highlighting the importance of hosting providers.

**Content Delivery Proxies:**
- Identified over 30,000 intermediary IPs from 8 well-known CPs and CDNs, interacting with IPs from over 1,000 different ASes.
- CDPs are responsible for 17% of the requests from heavy-hitter IPs.
- Some back-end servers are located within ISP ASes, not the CDN's AS.

**Other Intermediaries:**
- The remaining 151,000 intermediary IPs are located in over 7,000 ASes, contacting 399,000 servers in 10,000 different ASes.
- Most ASes hosting heavy-hitters are hosting and/or cloud service providers.
- A single hosting/cloud service provider is responsible for 21% of the requests, underscoring the importance of cloud services in the back office of the Web ecosystem.
