I just stumbled across this in the minified version of Bootstrap 1.3.0. On
line 4 we have:
    ol,ul{list-style:none;}
and on line 88 we have:
    ul,ol{margin:0 0 18px 25px;}
. Obviously they could be written as one rule:
    ul,ol{margin:0 0 18px 25px;list-style:none;}
I'm not sure this is bug in less or wherever, but I guess you could save some
bandwidth fixing this minor bug!
