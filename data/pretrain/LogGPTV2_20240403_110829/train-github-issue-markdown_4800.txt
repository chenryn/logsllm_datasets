I recently came across an observation while reviewing the minified version of Bootstrap 1.3.0. Specifically, on line 4, there is the following CSS rule:

```css
ol, ul { list-style: none; }
```

And on line 88, there is another rule:

```css
ul, ol { margin: 0 0 18px 25px; }
```

These two rules can be combined into a single, more efficient rule:

```css
ul, ol { margin: 0 0 18px 25px; list-style: none; }
```

While this may not necessarily be a bug in the LESS compiler or elsewhere, combining these rules would help to reduce the file size and potentially save some bandwidth. 

This minor optimization could contribute to better performance and a more streamlined codebase.
