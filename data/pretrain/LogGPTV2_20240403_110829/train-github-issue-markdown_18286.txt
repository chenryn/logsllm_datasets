### Issue Details
  * **Electron Version:** 5.0.0
  * **Operating System:** LTS version of Ubuntu (18.04) (and other various versions)
  * **Last Known Working Electron version:** : none
### Expected Behavior
I just released a Linux version of my app and several users have reported that
on launch it fails with the error `GLIBC_2.29' not found`.
### Actual Behavior
App should launch
### To Reproduce
You can probably package up Electron 5.0.0 and try to run an AppImage on linux
and you'll see it. I gave out a linux build at 4.* before and I think it also
had the same issue?
I feel like this might be a simple issue: the latest electron versions require
glibc 2.29 and many linux distros aren't up-to-date with that yet. If so, I
would have expected to see many other issues reported, because I've had many
users complain about this (see
https://www.reddit.com/r/actualbudget/comments/bghvfg/any_plans_for_a_linux_client_in_the_future/).
Am I doing something wrong?
