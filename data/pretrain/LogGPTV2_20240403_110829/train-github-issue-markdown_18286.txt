### Issue Details
- **Electron Version:** 5.0.0
- **Operating System:** LTS version of Ubuntu (18.04) and other various versions
- **Last Known Working Electron Version:** None

### Expected Behavior
The application should launch successfully on Linux.

### Actual Behavior
Upon launching the application, users encounter the error `GLIBC_2.29 not found`.

### To Reproduce
1. Package an Electron 5.0.0 application as an AppImage.
2. Attempt to run the AppImage on a Linux system, such as Ubuntu 18.04 or another distribution.
3. Observe the `GLIBC_2.29 not found` error.

### Additional Information
- I previously released a Linux build using Electron 4.x, and it also experienced similar issues.
- It seems that recent Electron versions may require GLIBC 2.29, which is not yet available in many Linux distributions.
- Given the number of user complaints (see [this Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/actualbudget/comments/bghvfg/any_plans_for_a_linux_client_in_the_future/)), I suspect this might be a common issue.
- Is there something specific I need to do to resolve this, or is this a known limitation with Electron 5.0.0 and older Linux distributions?

Thank you for your assistance.
