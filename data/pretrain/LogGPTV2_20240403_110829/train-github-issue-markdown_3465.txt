Hi, I hope this is an appropriate forum for a feature request. For context -
I've just been confused by the lack of configuring semicolons for the `deno
lint` command, when you're able to customize other things such as
quotes(double vs single).
Now, I understand not everyone likes ASI in JavaScript, but isn't the whole
point of a linting tool to empower users to define their own coding standards?
So to that end, I would like to ask the Deno maintainers if there are any
plans to expand the scope of what can be configured with `deno lint`? Or is
the intent of the tool to be opinionated and enforce one standard upon all
users of the built in command?
