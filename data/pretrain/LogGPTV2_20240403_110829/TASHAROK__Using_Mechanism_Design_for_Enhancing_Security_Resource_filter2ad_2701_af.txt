IX. CONCLUSION
We studied interdependent systems that are managed by
multiple stakeholders and are prone to cyber attacks that
progress in a stepping-stone manner. We modeled such attack
scenarios using a game-theoretic framework and captured the
attack progression and interdependency via attack graphs, in
our framework called TASHAROK. We then analyzed two
tax-based mechanism types for our interdependent security
setups where the central regulator incentivizes defenders to
achieve socially optimal allocations. We then showed that
a mechanism designer cannot guarantee social optimality
without paying money to incentivize defenders in all instances
of our interdependent security games. We also showed the
effect of behavioral bias on the two mechanisms’ outcomes
where higher bias leads to paying more taxes. We then
explored the relation between the tax amount and the voluntary
participation of defenders in the mechanism and showed that
behavioral defenders choose to participate in the mechanism
even under higher
tax payments, compared to rational
defenders. We evaluated TASHAROK via four real-world
interdependent systems and showed the effect of mechanisms
on social cost and the effect of behavioral decision-making
on the mechanisms’ outcomes. We compared the security cost
achieved by security allocations of TASHAROK compared
to those of four baseline solutions from the attack graph
literature. We found that even with rational defenders
TASHAROK either equals or outperforms the baselines.
We believe that our study can help central regulators
and interdependent
systems’ defenders attain improved
understanding of their security risks and consequently make
more effective investment decisions to mitigate such risks,
including additional
risk from decisions under cognitive
biases. Future avenues of research include characterizing
the achievable security allocation, as well as the associated
mechanisms, and exploring attackers with cognitive bias.
