Abstract—Within the Domain Name System (DNS), govern-
ment domains form a particularly valuable part of the names-
pace, representing trusted sources of information, vital services,
and gateways for government personnel to engage in their duties.
As the COVID-19 pandemic has unfolded, governments’ digital
resources have become increasingly important to provide support
to populations largely in isolation. The accessibility of these
resources relies largely on the trustworthiness of the domains
that represent them. In this paper, we conduct an extensive
measurement study focused on the availability and legitimacy
of DNS records in the authoritative nameservers of government
domains for over 190 countries. Our measurements reveal that
thousands of domains do not use replicated authoritative name-
servers, as well as a substantial increase in the trend of more
domains relying on a single third-party DNS services provider.
We also ﬁnd more than 1,000 domains vulnerable to hijacking
due to defective delegations. Our work shows that although
robust overall, the deployments of authoritative nameservers
in government domains still contain a non-trivial number of
conﬁgurations that do not meet RFC requirements, leading to
poor performance and reduced reliability that may leave domains
vulnerable to hijacking.

I. INTRODUCTION
“Running a nameserver is not a trivial
task” [1]. The
introduction to RFC 1912 (Common DNS Operational and
Conﬁguration Errors) highlights the complexities involved
in operating authoritative DNS (ADNS) nameservers. The
challenge described in some ways explains the story that has
played out in the DNS, where common misconﬁgurations
persist despite many efforts to uncover their prevalence and
impact and to provide solutions. Errors in the DNS are easily
made, and sometimes difﬁcult to detect and correct, as redun-
dancy often hides the existence or impact of a single failing
component. Even beyond issues of conﬁgurations that are
easily recognized as incorrect (e.g., delegating to authoritative
servers that do not exist), DNS operators face subjective
decisions about the appropriate conﬁguration for their servers.
In some scenarios, an ideal solution may not exist. In light
of these realities, we have little reason for surprise that many
of the errors that were featured 26 years ago in RFC 1912
continue within the DNS to this day.
While the DNS has continued to operate successfully in
the presence of relatively widespread misconﬁgurations, the
past few years have witnessed the DNS targeted or lever-
aged in new or increasingly severe attacks on individuals,
organizations, and governments [2]–[6]. The latter point is
of particular concern, as e-government plays a vital role in
the daily lives of citizens. Since the COVID-19 pandemic has
unfolded, information and communication technologies (ICTs)
have become critically important
to governments dissemi-
nating information and services as populations have grown
more isolated [7]. The DNS plays a key role in this context.
The government resources that citizens seek to access are
represented by domain names, and the overall trustworthi-
ness of these services necessarily rests on the reliability of
authoritative DNS deployments. The ever-increasing growth in
attacks against (and increasing reliance upon) the DNS calls
for renewed attention to the reliability and security of the DNS,
particularly those domains used by governments.
In this paper, we conduct an extensive measurement study
to assess the health of the DNS with respect to domains
belonging to e-government resources. We ﬁrst compile a list of
global government domains by extending the reported domains
from the United Nations’ E-Government Knowledge Base [8].
We then retrieve the relevant records from a passive DNS
(PDNS) database covering a 10-year period to obtain their
nameserver information and identify their evolution. In the
meantime, we conduct active measurements to characterize
the nameserver deployment of studied domains and investigate
their conﬁguration issues and potential pitfalls.
More speciﬁcally, we examine ADNS replication among
the government domains to gain insights as to whether they
are well maintained for high availability and reliability. We
focus on evaluating the resilience of government-controlled
domains’ ADNS deployments both over the past 10 years and
at the present. Furthermore, we investigate two fundamental
conﬁguration issues that are still common within the DNS:
defective delegations and delegation inconsistency. We partic-
ularly look for risks of government domains that may cause
service degradation or even service interruption.
Our major contributions are summarized as follows:
• We conduct an extensive measurement study of authori-
tative DNS server deployments for zones related to the e-
governments among over 190 countries using both active
data collection and passive DNS datasets.
• We perform an analysis based on 10 years of PDNS
data and observe thousands of domains using only one
nameserver each year, and a 60% increase in the countries

II. BACKGROUND
A. DNS and the Role of Nameservers
The DNS is a globally distributed database,
in which
the responsibility for managing portions of the database is
delegated to independent entities. The system is organized into
what are known as zones. The presence of nameserver (NS)
resource records (RRs) deﬁnes zone boundaries: a domain that
has an NS record is the “top node” of a zone [9]. A key concept
within this framework is that of parent and child. A parent
is deﬁned as “The domain in which the Child is registered”
[10]. A child is basically a subdomain of a parent domain,
where both the parent and the child have NS records. A child
domain is necessarily a subdomain of its parent, but not all
subdomains are child zones. Rather, zones are deﬁned by the
position of NS records. Where NS records appear in the DNS,
they mark the “top” of a zone. A zone ﬁle consists of the set
of authoritative resource records identiﬁed within the zone.
Each zone must have one or more authoritative nameservers
that are responsible for maintaining and distributing the zone’s
RRs, including those with information about how to ﬁnd the
authoritative nameservers of child zones. This role makes
authoritative nameservers a vital piece of the DNS. Given the
need for the high availability and reliability of these servers, a
zone should have multiple authoritative nameservers [9] placed
in different locations and networks [11]. Paradoxically, while
authoritative nameserver replication maintains high availability
and reliability, it also introduces various problems with the
consistency of NS records. Further, as long as at least one
authoritative nameserver of a domain can be reached and
works properly,
the misconﬁgurations or failures of other
authoritative nameservers may not be detected by the domain
owner in a timely manner. This type of scenario plays out
relatively often in the real world and can cause problems in
service availability, and create security risks.
