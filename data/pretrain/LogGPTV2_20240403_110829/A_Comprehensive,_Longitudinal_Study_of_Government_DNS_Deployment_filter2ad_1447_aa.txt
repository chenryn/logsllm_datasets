**Abstract:**
Within the Domain Name System (DNS), government domains are a particularly valuable part of the namespace, representing trusted sources of information, vital services, and gateways for government personnel to perform their duties. As the COVID-19 pandemic has unfolded, digital resources provided by governments have become increasingly important in supporting populations largely in isolation. The accessibility and trustworthiness of these resources depend heavily on the reliability of the domains that represent them. In this paper, we conduct an extensive measurement study focusing on the availability and legitimacy of DNS records in the authoritative nameservers of government domains across over 190 countries. Our measurements reveal that thousands of domains do not use replicated authoritative nameservers, and there is a significant increase in the trend of more domains relying on a single third-party DNS service provider. We also identify more than 1,000 domains vulnerable to hijacking due to defective delegations. Although robust overall, the deployment of authoritative nameservers in government domains still contains a non-trivial number of configurations that do not meet RFC requirements, leading to poor performance and reduced reliability, which may leave domains vulnerable to hijacking.

## I. Introduction
"Running a nameserver is not a trivial task" [1]. The introduction to RFC 1912 (Common DNS Operational and Configuration Errors) highlights the complexities involved in operating authoritative DNS (ADNS) nameservers. These challenges explain why common misconfigurations persist despite efforts to uncover their prevalence and impact and to provide solutions. Errors in the DNS are easily made and sometimes difficult to detect and correct, as redundancy often masks the existence or impact of a single failing component. Even beyond issues of configurations that are easily recognized as incorrect (e.g., delegating to authoritative servers that do not exist), DNS operators face subjective decisions about the appropriate configuration for their servers. In some scenarios, an ideal solution may not exist. Given these realities, it is unsurprising that many of the errors highlighted 26 years ago in RFC 1912 continue to persist in the DNS today.

While the DNS has continued to operate successfully despite widespread misconfigurations, recent years have seen the DNS targeted or leveraged in new or increasingly severe attacks on individuals, organizations, and governments [2]–[6]. This is particularly concerning because e-government plays a vital role in the daily lives of citizens. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, information and communication technologies (ICTs) have become critically important for governments disseminating information and services as populations have grown more isolated [7]. The DNS plays a key role in this context. The government resources that citizens seek to access are represented by domain names, and the overall trustworthiness of these services depends on the reliability of authoritative DNS deployments. The increasing growth in attacks against and reliance on the DNS calls for renewed attention to the reliability and security of the DNS, particularly for domains used by governments.

In this paper, we conduct an extensive measurement study to assess the health of the DNS with respect to domains belonging to e-government resources. We first compile a list of global government domains by extending the reported domains from the United Nations’ E-Government Knowledge Base [8]. We then retrieve relevant records from a passive DNS (PDNS) database covering a 10-year period to obtain their nameserver information and identify their evolution. Simultaneously, we conduct active measurements to characterize the nameserver deployment of the studied domains and investigate their configuration issues and potential pitfalls.

More specifically, we examine ADNS replication among government domains to gain insights into whether they are well-maintained for high availability and reliability. We focus on evaluating the resilience of government-controlled domains' ADNS deployments both over the past 10 years and at the present. Furthermore, we investigate two fundamental configuration issues that are still common within the DNS: defective delegations and delegation inconsistency. We particularly look for risks of government domains that may cause service degradation or even service interruption.

Our major contributions are summarized as follows:
- We conduct an extensive measurement study of authoritative DNS server deployments for zones related to e-governments across over 190 countries using both active data collection and passive DNS datasets.
- We perform an analysis based on 10 years of PDNS data and observe thousands of domains using only one nameserver each year, and a 60% increase in the countries relying on any single third-party ADNS provider between 2011 and 2020.
- We reveal different patterns of misconfigurations, including stale records leaving over 1,000 government domains open to hijacking.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II provides relevant background. We describe our approach in Section III and present our results in Section IV. Section V discusses the limitations and implications of our findings. Section VI surveys related work, and finally, Section VII concludes our study.

## II. Background

### A. DNS and the Role of Nameservers
The DNS is a globally distributed database, where the responsibility for managing portions of the database is delegated to independent entities. The system is organized into what are known as zones. The presence of nameserver (NS) resource records (RRs) defines zone boundaries: a domain that has an NS record is the "top node" of a zone [9]. A key concept within this framework is that of parent and child. A parent is defined as "The domain in which the Child is registered" [10]. A child is essentially a subdomain of a parent domain, where both the parent and the child have NS records. A child domain is necessarily a subdomain of its parent, but not all subdomains are child zones. Rather, zones are defined by the position of NS records. Where NS records appear in the DNS, they mark the "top" of a zone. A zone file consists of the set of authoritative resource records identified within the zone.

Each zone must have one or more authoritative nameservers responsible for maintaining and distributing the zone's RRs, including those with information about how to find the authoritative nameservers of child zones. This role makes authoritative nameservers a vital piece of the DNS. Given the need for high availability and reliability, a zone should have multiple authoritative nameservers [9] placed in different locations and networks [11]. Paradoxically, while authoritative nameserver replication maintains high availability and reliability, it also introduces various problems with the consistency of NS records. Further, as long as at least one authoritative nameserver of a domain can be reached and works properly, the misconfigurations or failures of other authoritative nameservers may not be detected by the domain owner in a timely manner. This type of scenario plays out relatively often in the real world and can cause problems in service availability and create security risks.
