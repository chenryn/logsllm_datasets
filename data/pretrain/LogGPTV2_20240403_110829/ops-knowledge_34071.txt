User: Please list a Docker-based application deployment process
Assistant: 1. Write a Dockerfile to specify the operating system, compilation/running environment, dependencies, and applications required by the application image. 2. Build a Docker image, using the content defined in the Dockerfile to build an application image. 3. Publish the image, and publish the application image to Docker Hub and other places where container images can be distributed, so that others can use and deploy them. 4. Deploy the container, use the docker run command to start the container, and map the port of the application to the port of the host. 5. Test the application to check that the application running in the container is working properly. 6. If the application version needs to be updated, the entire process can be repeated from the first step to generate a new application image and update the container.
