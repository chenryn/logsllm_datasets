User: I installed both Python 2.7 and Python 2.6.5. I don't know what went wrong, but nothing related to Python seems to work any more. e.g. "setup.py install" for certain packages don't recognize the "install" parameter and other odd phenomena...
I would like to completely remove Python from my system.
I tried running the 2.7 and 2.6 msi files and choosing remove Python and then running only 2.6 and reinstalling it. Still stuff don't work.
How do I completely remove Python - from everything? (!)
I would not like to reinstall my entire machine just because of the Python install...
Assistant: I know it is an old question, but I ran into this problem with 2.7 and 3.5. Though 2.7 would not show up in my default windows uninstall list, it showed up fine in the ccleaner tools tab under uninstall. Uninstalled and reinstalled afterwards and it has been smooth coding ever since.
