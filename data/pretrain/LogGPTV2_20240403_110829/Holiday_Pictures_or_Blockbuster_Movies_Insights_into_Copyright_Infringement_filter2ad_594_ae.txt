manually extracted all URLs contained in the ﬁle names of the labelled samples
and veriﬁed that they were indeed indexing sites. Subsequently, we looked up
these URLs in the full data sets (including incomplete archives).
Table 6 lists the three most frequent URLs from each data set together with
the language of the respective web site. These sites include Warez boards and
blogs, span many diﬀerent languages and oﬀer varying types of content. The
most active site noor7.us uploaded 7,070 ﬁles to Wupload within only 48 hours.
We can estimate how many ﬁles these sites had currently available on Megau-
pload at the time of the measurement. megauploadforum.net, for instance, is
responsible for at least 123 ﬁles in the labelled sample (0.37 % of the full data set).

correspond to the fraction of legitimate, infringing and unknown labels among all ﬁles
smaller than the current value on the x axis. For comparison, the ■
curve shows the
ﬁle size CDF. Smaller ﬁles were more likely to be classiﬁed as legitimate whereas larger
ﬁles were more likely classiﬁed as infringing. On FF, for instance, the point of an equal
share of legitimate and infringing labels is for an upper ﬁle size limit of 200 MB.

By extrapolation, we estimate that the site had between 655,516 and 1,023,603
ﬁles tagged with the site’s URL stored on Megaupload’s servers at the time of
our experiment (a 99 % conﬁdence interval).
However, these numbers are relatively modest when taking into account that
OCHs such as Filesonic and Wupload, which were less popular than Megaupload
during our measurements, received around one million uploads every day. There
must have been many more (and potentially more active) actors who uploaded
to Megaupload, but they are not distinguishable in our data set because they
did not tag their uploads.
6 Discussion
Our analysis provides approximated lower bounds for the proportion of legiti-
mate and infringing ﬁles hosted on a range of OCHs. While these results suggest
signiﬁcant levels of copyright infringement on each of the OCHs, the question
of whether the OCHs are actually responsible for these user uploads is a very
diﬀerent problem that we are not attempting to address in this paper.
We stress that our analysis does not aim at labelling one OCH as more com-
pliant than another. Direct comparisons can be challenging because of subtle
diﬀerences in how we collected our data. Furthermore, we did not speciﬁcally
investigate which anti-abuse systems the OCHs had in place.
The present methodology was developed to estimate the prevalence of infring-
ing uploads after the fact. It worked well with our data sets because of the rela-
tively high numbers of rather explicit ﬁle names. This makes our methodology a

bad ﬁt for active upload ﬁlters: Many of the heuristics are trivial to circumvent
for uploaders who have a reason to do so. Moreover, most of our attempts at
automating the heuristics resulted in too many false positives, which ultimately
forced us to resort to manual labelling.
There are known techniques that OCHs have at hand to limit abuse and
copyright infringement on their systems. Blacklists based on ﬁle hashes are more
promising than approaches using ﬁle names: An uploader would need to repack
a ﬁle in order to circumvent a hash blacklist instead of simply renaming it.
Furthermore, hash blacklists limit false positives, and OCHs could conveniently
block access to all ﬁles with the same contents as soon as a complaint is received
for one of them. Rapidshare recently took a more drastic measure by restricting
the allowed download traﬃc per uploader [6], eﬀectively precluding the use of
its service for public sharing of popular content, infringing or not.
7 Conclusion
We conducted the ﬁrst large-scale study that quantiﬁed copyright infringement
in user uploads across ﬁve OCHs. Our results draw a mixed picture of both legit-
imate and infringing uses of OCHs. We classiﬁed 26 % to 79 % of the uploaded
ﬁles as infringing copyright, with potentially more infringing ﬁles that we were
not able to detect with our conservative and privacy-preserving methodology.

Overall, we were not able to classify between 21 % and 60 % of the ﬁles up-
loaded to the OCHs. That is, we do not know how many of these unclassiﬁed ﬁles
are legitimate or potentially infringing. In the case of Megaupload, for instance,
our methodology estimates the percentage of legitimate ﬁles as at least 4.3 %
and at most 69.3 %, whereas potentially infringing ﬁles account for at least 31 %
and at most 96 %. A goal for future work may be to provide a more precise esti-
mation of the ratio between legitimate and infringing ﬁles. However, it remains
unclear how this can be achieved in a privacy-preserving manner.
In our most conservative scenario, 4.3 % of the ﬁles hosted on Megaupload
were detected as legitimate, which corresponds to approximately 10.75 million
ﬁles. This quantity may appear relatively small compared to the 77.5 million
ﬁles that we classiﬁed as potentially infringing, and even smaller compared to
all the ﬁles we were not able to classify at all, yet it is quite large in absolute
terms. It conﬁrms the widely reported complaints of users who lost access to
their ﬁles as a side-eﬀect when Megaupload was forced to shut down.
