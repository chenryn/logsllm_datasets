### Manual Extraction and Verification of URLs

We manually extracted all URLs contained in the file names of the labeled samples and verified that these URLs indeed indexed relevant sites. Subsequently, we cross-referenced these URLs with the full data sets, including incomplete archives.

### Table 6: Most Frequent URLs in Data Sets

Table 6 lists the three most frequent URLs from each data set, along with the language of the respective website. These sites include Warez boards and blogs, span many different languages, and offer varying types of content. For example, the most active site, noor7.us, uploaded 7,070 files to Wupload within just 48 hours. We can estimate the number of files these sites had available on Megaupload at the time of our measurement. For instance, megauploadforum.net is responsible for at least 123 files in the labeled sample, which represents 0.37% of the full data set.

### Estimation of File Availability

By extrapolation, we estimate that megauploadforum.net had between 655,516 and 1,023,603 files tagged with the site’s URL stored on Megaupload’s servers at the time of our experiment (a 99% confidence interval). However, these numbers are relatively modest when considering that One-Click Hosters (OCHs) like Filesonic and Wupload, which were less popular than Megaupload during our measurements, received around one million uploads every day. There must have been many more (and potentially more active) actors uploading to Megaupload, but they are not distinguishable in our data set because they did not tag their uploads.

### Discussion

Our analysis provides approximate lower bounds for the proportion of legitimate and infringing files hosted on a range of OCHs. While our results suggest significant levels of copyright infringement on each OCH, the question of whether the OCHs are responsible for these user uploads is a different problem that we do not address in this paper.

We emphasize that our analysis does not aim to label one OCH as more compliant than another. Direct comparisons can be challenging due to subtle differences in how we collected our data. Additionally, we did not specifically investigate the anti-abuse systems in place at the OCHs.

The present methodology was developed to estimate the prevalence of infringing uploads after the fact. It worked well with our data sets due to the relatively high numbers of explicit file names. This makes our methodology a poor fit for active upload filters: Many of the heuristics are trivial to circumvent for uploaders who have a reason to do so. Moreover, most of our attempts at automating the heuristics resulted in too many false positives, ultimately forcing us to resort to manual labeling.

### Known Techniques to Limit Abuse

There are known techniques that OCHs can use to limit abuse and copyright infringement. Blacklists based on file hashes are more promising than approaches using file names: An uploader would need to repack a file to circumvent a hash blacklist instead of simply renaming it. Furthermore, hash blacklists limit false positives, and OCHs could block access to all files with the same contents as soon as a complaint is received for one of them. Rapidshare recently took a more drastic measure by restricting the allowed download traffic per uploader, effectively precluding the use of its service for public sharing of popular content, infringing or not.

### Conclusion

We conducted the first large-scale study to quantify copyright infringement in user uploads across five OCHs. Our results show a mixed picture of both legitimate and infringing uses of OCHs. We classified 26% to 79% of the uploaded files as infringing copyright, with potentially more infringing files that we were not able to detect with our conservative and privacy-preserving methodology. Overall, we were unable to classify between 21% and 60% of the files uploaded to the OCHs. In the case of Megaupload, for instance, our methodology estimates the percentage of legitimate files as at least 4.3% and at most 69.3%, whereas potentially infringing files account for at least 31% and at most 96%.

In our most conservative scenario, 4.3% of the files hosted on Megaupload were detected as legitimate, corresponding to approximately 10.75 million files. This quantity, while small compared to the 77.5 million files we classified as potentially infringing, is quite large in absolute terms. It confirms the widely reported complaints of users who lost access to their files as a side effect when Megaupload was forced to shut down.
