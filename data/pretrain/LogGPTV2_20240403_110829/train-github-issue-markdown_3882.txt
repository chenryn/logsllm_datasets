**EDIT** Probably duplicate of #15293
## Steps to Reproduce
  1. Clone https://github.com/flutter/website
  2. Run `./tool/travis.sh`
**Explanation:** We're analyzing our sample code in CI. The files exist in
file structures that aren't real flutter projects (example). This worked well
until very recently but now all our builds fail.
I can work around this but it would be great to have actual Flutter analysis
run on these standalone files.
## Logs from running the above command
Flutter crash report; please file at
