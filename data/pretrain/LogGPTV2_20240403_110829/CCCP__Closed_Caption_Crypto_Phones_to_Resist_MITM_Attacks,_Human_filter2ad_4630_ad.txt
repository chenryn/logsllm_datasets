### Improving Security, Usability, and Reducing Call Rejection: A Comparative Analysis of CCCP and Traditional Designs

#### Table 1: Projected Usability and Security Properties of CCCP vs. Traditional Design
| **Property** | **Traditional Design** | **CCCP** |
|-------------|------------------------|-----------|
| **Checksum Size** | Short | Short (and Long) |
| **Data MITM** | Poor | Excellent |
| **Different Voice** | Poor | Good |
| **Converted Voice** | Poor | Fair |
| **Matching Checksums** | Poor | Very Good |
| **Original Speaker (Optional)** | Poor | Good |

The highlighted cells in the table represent the key security and usability improvements offered by CCCP over traditional designs, specifically in the context of checksum comparison.

### False Positive and Negative Rates in Checksum Comparison and Speaker Verification

- **False Positive Rate of Checksum Comparison (FPRcc)**: This denotes the probability of accepting mismatching checksums due to potential transcription errors.
- **False Positive Rate of Speaker Verification (FPRsv)**: This represents the probability of accepting a different speaker's voice or a converted voice, indicating the system's vulnerability to voice MITM attacks.

### Accuracy in Benign Settings

- **False Negative Rate of Checksum Comparison (FNRcc)**: This measures the probability of rejecting valid checksums due to transcription errors or user mistakes.
- **False Negative Rate of Speaker Verification (FNRsv)**: This represents the probability of rejecting a valid speaker, impacting the usability of the system.

### Efficiency

The delays incurred in performing the checksum comparison and/or speaker verification tasks, referred to as completion time, can impact the overall usability of the system. These delays include:
- **Duration of Checksum**: Time taken by users to speak the checksum.
- **Tsv**: Users' delay in verifying the speaker.
- **Replay Rate (RR)**: Frequency of users requesting the other party to repeat the checksum.
- **Tcc**: Time taken by the transcriber.

### Comparison with Traditional Crypto Phones

As a baseline for our study, we compare the performance and accuracy of CCCP with traditional 2-word and 4-word crypto phones.

### System Setup

To demonstrate the feasibility of our CCCP model, we developed a web-based application for VoIP calls. The main components of this setup are:

- **Web-based Interface**: Developed using PHP, JavaScript, and HTML5, it includes a WebRTC voice client and a database client.
- **Web-based Voice Application**: Set up on an Amazon EC2 instance, it uses FreeSWITCH 1.6.7 for VoIP protocols and supports SIP, IVR, and WebRTC.
- **IVR System**: Configured to play instructions and voice recordings based on DTMF signals.
- **Response Database**: PostgreSQL database to store participant responses and audio files.

### Study Protocol

- **Pre-study Step**: Participants fill out a demographic questionnaire and familiarize themselves with the speaker's voice.
- **Main Study Phase**: Participants make a VoIP call, speak a displayed checksum, and verify the speaker's voice.
- **Checksum Speaking Task**: Participants speak the displayed checksum, which is recorded and analyzed offline.
- **Speaker Verification Task**: Participants listen to a voice speaking the checksum and verify if it matches the original speaker's voice.

### Statistical Analysis Methodology

- **Friedman Test**: Used to test for statistical differences within groups.
- **Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test**: Used to examine pairwise differences with Bonferroni corrections.

### Demographic Information

- **Gender**: 55.8% male, 44.2% female.
- **Age**: 33.8% aged 18-24, 32.5% aged 25-34, 23.1% aged 35-44, 8.0% aged 45-54, and 2.9% aged 55-64.
- **Education**: 26.1% high school graduates, 32.7% college degree, 33.4% Bachelor’s degree, and 7.9% Master’s degree.
- **Hearing Impairment**: 96.7% of participants reported no hearing impairment.

### Design of Checksum Comparison with Standard Transcribers

- **Transcription Tools**: Google Speech API, Apple Mac Dictation, IBM Watson, and CMUSphinx.
- **Selected Tool**: IBM Watson Speech to Text service, chosen for its high accuracy and ease of development.

### Resistance to Attacks

- **Data MITM**: FPRcc is 0%, indicating robustness against data MITM attacks.
- **Voice MITM**: FPRsv for different speaker attack is at most 12%, and for voice conversion attack, it is about 20%.

### Accuracy in Benign Setting

- **FNRcc**: 24.57% for 4-word checksums and 63.17% for 8-word checksums, indicating the error rate in benign settings.

This comprehensive analysis demonstrates that CCCP offers significant improvements in both security and usability over traditional designs, making it a robust solution for secure communication.
