ABSTRACT
Microblogging services, such as Twitter, are among the most
important online social networks(OSNs). Diﬀerent from OSNs
such as Facebook, the topology of microblogging service is
a directed graph instead of an undirected graph. Recently,
due to the explosive increase of population size, graph sam-
pling has started to play a critical role in measurement and
characterization studies of such OSNs. However, previous
studies have only focused on the unbiased sampling of undi-
rected social graphs. In this paper, we study the unbiased
sampling algorithm for directed social graphs. Based on the
traditional Metropolis-Hasting Random Walk (MHRW) al-
gorithm, we propose an unbiased sampling method for di-
rected social graphs(USDSG). Using this method, we get
the ﬁrst, to the best of our knowledge, unbiased sample of
directed social graphs. Through extensive experiments com-
paring with the ”ground truth” (UNI, obtained through uni-
form sampling of directed graph nodes), we show that our
method can achieve excellent performance in directed graph
sampling and the error to UNI is less than 10%.

INTRODUCTION
In recent years, the population of Online Social Networks
(OSNs) has experienced an explosive increase. Twitter, for
example, has attracted over 100 million users by April 2010.
The world-wide spreading of OSNs has motivated a large

amount of studies from research community to measure and
analyze the characteristics of social graphs. The data that
these studies use are either complete datesets from network
operators, which are commonly not publicly accessible, or
self-crawled datasets, which are normally incomplete or bi-
ased to high-degree nodes sometimes. Thus, lots of attention
has been put on how to obtain a representative or unbiased
dataset from a large social graph using graph sampling tech-
niques.
Breadth-First-Search [1] and Random Walk (without dis-
tinguishing the degree of neighboring nodes) are the most
popular ways to sample the social graphs. However, previ-
ous study [2] has shown that both of them are biased to-
wards high-degree nodes.
In [2], Metropolis-Hasting Ran-
dom Walk(MHRW) is proposed to obtain samples from an
undirected graph, such as Facebook. This algorithm can
guarantee the unbiasedness of the sampling procedure, thus
can keep all the statistical properties of undirected social
graphs. However, unlike Facebook, microblogging networks
such as Twitter do not require reciprocation in the rela-
tionship: one can follow anyone without being followed. In
other words, Twitter is a directed other than undirected so-
cial graph, and thus can not be sampled using the previous
methods.
In this paper, we propose the solution to unbiasedly sam-
ple a directed graph. Our contributions are twofold. Firstly,
based on the unique properties of directed graphs, we pro-
pose a sampling algorithm that is unbiased. Secondly, through
comparison with “ground truth” (global uniform sampling)
by extensive experiments, we proved that this method can
achieve excellent performance in directed graph sampling.
2. DESIGN FRAMEWORK
Metropolis-Hasting Random Walk(MHRW) is a Markov
Chain Monte Carlo(MCMC) algorithm to obtain random
samples from a probability distribution for which direct sam-
pling is diﬃcult. However, MHRW is not applicable in di-
rected graphs because there is a probability that we ’walk’
to a node whose out degree is 0. It means, once we ’walk’
to this node, we can never go to other nodes through pure
random walk. An intuitive approach to solve the problem
is to randomly choose a neighboring node (in degree neigh-
401bors) as next node. But it would be biased to high-degree
nodes. For each source node, the Markov chain is not long
enough to converge to the target probability distribution.
In our method, USDSG, we consider all unidirectional
edges as bidirectional edges to solve the problem.
In this
case, after choosing a well-connected initial node (we don’t
want nodes with no edges connecting with), we can reach all
the other nodes.
Furthermore, a new proposal function is needed in US-
DSG, which depends on current state to generate a new pro-
posal sample. In previous study[2], node degree kv is used as
proposal function to obtain unbiased samples in undirected
graphs. The proposal function changes the transition prob-
abilities and modiﬁes the bias towards high-degree nodes.
As a result, the sample converges to uniform distribution.
In a directed graph, neither in degree nor out degree can
form the proposal function by itself, because the properties
relevant to the other would get lost.
As we have mentioned above, all edges are considered as
bidirectional edges.
In this condition, we can simply use
the number of connected neighbors of each node as proposal
function. It is the same as node degree in undirected graphs.
USDSG algorithm works in the following way. First, we
obtain a random node v as current state, and the proposal
function is Q(v). A node w is then chosen from node v’s
connected nodes as the next proposal sample. In the next
step, we generate (cid:11) from uniform distribution U (0; 1):
if
(cid:11) 6 Q(v)
Q(w) , we say a proposal is accepted and w is taken as
the next sample; else, v remains to be the sample. It can
be proved that if we have enough steps, the sampling will
converge to an uniform distribution.
To conclude, by changing directed graphs into undirected
graphs and then applying a new proposal function, USDSG
can leverage MHRW to do unbiased sampling in the resulted
graphs. This is theoretically correct because MHRW guar-
antees that we can get unbiased sample from an undirected
graph regardless of the topology.
3. EVALUATION
In this section we conduct experiments on real datasets
to evaluate our method. The datasets we use are avail-
able at [4], which collects extensive large network datasets
of social graphs. The datasets we use are soc-Epinions1
with 75,879 nodes and 508,837 edges, soc-Slashdot0811 with
77,360 nodes and 905,468 edges and soc-Slashdot0922 with
82,168 nodes and 948,464 edges.
For each dataset, we calculate node degree and record
connected nodes for each node. In this way we change di-
rected graphs into undirected graphs. We omit those nodes
whose degree is 0 because these nodes cannot be used as ini-
tial nodes. It won’t aﬀect the result because once we start
random walk, we won’t walk to these nodes. Then we use
MHRW to obtain samples and analyze the average degree
of the samples.
From table 1 we can see the result of our method is almost
the same as that of UNI. We deﬁne error as follows:
error =
jU SDSG (cid:0) U N Ij
U N I
All errors are less than 10%. This shows USDSG performs
very well in unbiased sampling.
To further study the unbiased estimation, we consider the
CDFs of node degree distribution. We obtain both in degree

tribution function. For all the three diﬀerent datasets, we
get similar results. Due to the space limitation, we will only
present the results from Slashdot0811. As we have men-
tioned, the variation is very large, some nodes even have in
degree or out degree that is more than 1,000. In the ﬁgures
we only plot the CDFs when in degree or out degree is less
than 120. From the ﬁgure we can see that the sample we
obtain through our method is almost identical to the UNI.
This demonstrates that USDSG can get unbiased samples.
4. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we obtained the ﬁrst, to the best of our
knowledge, unbiased (i.e., uniform) sampling method of di-
rected social graphs, USDSG based on traditional MHRW
method. We also compare the result with UNI, and the re-
sults show that USDSG can performs sampling almost iden-
tical with UNI.
