User: In python, given a directory or file path like /usr/local, I need to get the file system where its available.  In some systems it could be / (root) itself and in some others it could be /usr.
I tried os.statvfs it doesnt help.  Do I have to run the df command with the path name and extract the file system from the output?  Is there a better solution?
Its for linux/unix platforms only.
Thanks
Assistant: As df itself opens and parses /etc/mtab, you could either go this way and parse this file as well (an alternative would be /proc/mounts), or you indeed parse the df output.
