### Title: The Unbelievable Insecurity of the Big Data Stack: An Offensive Approach to Analyzing Complex Big Data Infrastructures

The term "Big Data" encompasses a vast and diverse array of technologies, each responsible for transporting, storing, and processing millions of records. The rapid pace at which data must be processed, combined with the need for seamless communication between these technologies, often leaves security measures lagging behind. Complexity, as always, is the greatest adversary of security.

Currently, there is no established methodology for conducting a comprehensive security assessment of Big Data infrastructures, and technical resources for analyzing potential attack vectors are scarce. Moreover, many vulnerabilities that are well-recognized in traditional or cloud-based infrastructures may not be considered vulnerabilities in the context of Big Data. This raises a critical question: What constitutes a security problem in Big Data infrastructures, and what does not? This research aims to provide answers to this and other key questions, equipping security professionals with the necessary methodologies and skills to effectively analyze the security of such complex systems.

This talk will present a structured methodology for assessing the security of Big Data infrastructures, along with new and impactful attack vectors across the four primary layers of the Big Data stack: Data Ingestion, Data Storage, Data Processing, and Data Access. Some of the techniques that will be discussed include:

- **Remote Attack on Centralized Cluster Configuration:** Exploiting the centralized cluster configuration managed by ZooKeeper.
- **Packet Crafting for Hadoop RPC/IPC Communication:** Crafting packets to remotely communicate with the Hadoop Remote Procedure Call (RPC) and Inter-Process Communication (IPC) mechanisms to compromise the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS).
- **Malicious YARN Application Development:** Developing a malicious application for the Yet Another Resource Negotiator (YARN) to achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE).
- **Interference with Data Ingestion Channels:** Disrupting data ingestion channels and abusing drivers of HDFS-based storage technologies like Hive and HBase.
- **Exploitation of Query Platforms:** Abusing platforms designed to query multiple data lakes, such as Presto.

In addition to these attack vectors, the talk will provide actionable security recommendations to help prevent the attacks described. By understanding these vulnerabilities and implementing the suggested mitigations, organizations can better protect their Big Data infrastructures from potential threats.
