cellular demand, while the majority of active cellular addresses
carry very little demand. Attempts at measuring cellular networks
from IP addresses must be aware of these concentrations in traf-
fic distributions. Such concentrations may also make possible to
capture representative samples of measurements for these networks
with a relatively small number of target addresses.
Finding 4: In mixed cellular networks, nearly 60% of DNS re-
solvers are shared between cellular and fixed-line clients. This
implies that DNS resolvers alone are insufficient for identifying
client type. The use of shared resolvers may also challenge client
localization for common request routing systems. For instance, we
found in a large Brazilian MNO that while cellular and fixed-line
clients shared resolvers, the resolvers were only geographically
proximal for fixed-line clients. Cellular clients were located over
1470 miles away.
Finding 5: We find significant public DNS usage by cellular
clients outside the U.S. This breaks from common assumptions
that cellular clients only use operator provided DNS and further
complicates attempts at using DNS for end user mapping in CDNs.
7 MACROSCOPIC VIEW OF CELLULAR
NETWORKS
In the following section, we take a macroscopic view of cellular
networks to identify trends that may help inform the different
Internet stakeholders – mobile operators, content providers and
policy makers.
7.1 Global Cellular Demand Distribution
We first take a look at the overall distribution of global cellular
demand at the continent level. We look at cellular network trends
across the following metrics: (i) the percentage of a continent’s
demand that is cellular (ii) the percentage of global cellular de-
mand originating from that continent (iii) the number of mobile
subscribers, 4 per continent [17] and (iv) the cellular demand per
subscriber. Table 8 summarizes these metrics by continent.
Column 1 presents the percentage of each continent’s demand
that originates from cellular access links. Overall we find that cel-
lular networks account for 16.2% of all demand worldwide. At first
take, this appears to be quite different (2-3x) that what has been re-
ported previously by industry. For instance, the 2016 5 report from
Ericsson [10], based on 2015 data, finds mobile traffic to account

around the globe, labeled by network country. Outside of U.S.
operators, we see large fractions of cellular users reliant on
public DNS services.
One possible explanation for the prevalence of public DNS usage
in operators from countries such as India, China and Brazil may be
the reported larger fraction of non-handset devices connected to
cellular networks – connected either directly or tethered through
mobile hotspot. Investigating the variety of device types across
different networks is left as future work.
6.4 Summary of Key Findings
We now summarize the key findings from this section. We pre-
sented the first survey on the composition and traffic dynamics
of global cellular networks. We highlighted the diversity of the
network composition – mixed or dedicated ASes – and supporting
infrastructure, such as how network infrastructure such as DNS
resolvers are assigned and shared.
Finding 1: A majority of cellular networks (58.6%) are mixed,
hosting both cellular and fixed-line broadband clients. Given the
prevalence of mixed ASes, efforts on network characterization ef-
forts should take access technology composition into account.
Finding 2: Cellular demand is centralized in a few, large net-
works. We find that the top 10 cellular ASes account for 38% of
global demand. Each of the top 10 operators reside in countries
that cover large geographic areas, and have well developed cellular
infrastructure. In the future, overall demand may become more
equitable as more operators upgrade from 3G to LTE infrastructure.
Finding 3: Cellular traffic is concentrated in a small fraction
of IP addresses. Due to the presence of NATs for cellular clients
in many networks, a handful of /24 subnets generate much of the

for 8.11% of the global total while the 2017 Cisco VNI states that
mobile traffic accounts for 8% of global traffic [8].
The difference can be at least partially explained by our use of
request demand to calculate demand. While this metric is useful
for comparison, e.g. between continents or countries, it is difficult
to infer from it overall traffic demand as defined in those reports
since, in many cases, objects served for the same application-level
request over a cellular connection are much smaller than on a wired
connection.
Looking at individual continents, the fraction of cellular demand
varies between 11.3% in Europe to 25.5% and 26% in Africa and
Asia, respectively. The high fractions of cellular demand in Africa
and Asia is partially explained by the limited deployment of fixed-
line telecommunications infrastructure. The European’s fraction is,
however, somewhat surprising given the mature mobile telecom-
munications industry. It is important to note that our calculations
exclude demand data from China. We did not feel confident in the
demand values we obtained for Chinese end users, and therefore ex-
cluded it from our calculations. Our data therefore underestimates
the overall demand fraction from Asia, since it lacks data for China
and its 1.3 billion mobile subscribers [17].
We next look at the percentage of cellular demand contained
within each continent. We find Asia generates the largest amount
of cellular demand, with 38.9% of the global cellular total. North
America is the next largest with 35%, followed by Europe with 15.9%.
South America (4.1%), Oceania (3%) and Africa (2.9%) compose the
remaining 10%. These trends are in line with industry reports [10]
showing Asia, followed by North America as the main contributors.
When looking at demand per subscriber (Col. 5), we find that
Oceania has the greatest demand per subscriber, followed closely by
North America. This may be due in part to the type of access tech-
nology, devices and particular subscriptions with large penetration
of high-end devices and well-built WCDMA and LTE infrastruc-
ture [10]. 4G users have been shown to generate 10x the traffic than
3G networks [8]. Conversely, Africa has the lowest per subscriber
demand, which one would expect given its infrastructure is domi-
nated by second generation wireless technology (GSM and EDGE),
and has the lowest penetration of 4G wireless technology [10].
7.2 Country-level Statistics
We look next at the distribution of cellular demand across individ-
ual countries within each continent. Figure 11 plots the top ten
countries within each continent, displaying the fraction of global

lar demand (CD) and fraction of cellular traffic (CFD). Notice

cellular demand within them. The figure highlights the large impact
of top countries, in terms of demand, on the overall distribution of
cellular demand. We observe a clear heavy tail distribution, with
the U.S. accounting for over 30% of global cellular demand. The top
5 countries, all in Asia with the exception of the U.S., contribute
55.7% of global cellular demand, and the top 20 countries make up
a notable 80% of the global total.
We investigate these trends further by looking, for each country,
at the relationship between cellular demand and the fraction of
that country’s total demand labeled as cellular. Figure 12 plots this
relationship with the country cellular demand (CD) on the y axis
and the fraction of total demand that is cellular (CDF) on the x axis.
The figure shows the wide range of degrees in which cellular
connectivity is relied on in different countries. We find the majority
of countries within Europe, South and North America all clustered
together on the far left, composed of cellular fractions of demand
lower than 0.2. The right 80% of the figure is populated mainly
by countries in Africa and Asia, and represent cellular dominant
network connectivity.
The frontier on the upper right side of the figure shows countries
with either very high levels of cellular demand (e.g., US), a very
high fraction of overall cellular traffic (e.g., Ghana), or both (e.g.,
Indonesia). For instance, although the U.S. has by far the largest
overall cellular demand, it only accounts for 16.6% of overall country

traffic. In contrast, cellular demand in Laos and Ghana represents
87.1% and 95.9% of their overall country demand respectively. On
both extremes, Indonesia (ID), the 4th largest country for cellular
demand, uses cellular connectivity for 63% of its country’s traffic
demand! We believe these countries along the frontier represent
ideal targets for further study to understand the traffic dynamics
and user behavior in areas which are already mobile dominated.
7.3 Summary of Key Findings
We summarize the key findings from our macroscopic view of
cellular networks. This perspective illustrates the large dominance
in terms of traffic of a few markets, such as the U.S, and the various
roles played by cellular connectivity around the globe – from a
supplementary service in much of Europe to the primary means of
connectivity in Asia and Africa.
Finding 1: Cellular traffic makes up 16.2% of all global traffic
demand in our dataset. In Asia and Africa, cellular traffic accounts
for 25.5% and 26% of continent demand, respectively.
Finding 2: In terms of cellular traffic demand, the top countries
dominate the overall distribution, to an even greater degree than
AS level demand. The top 5 countries account for 55.7% of global
cellular traffic demand, and the top 20 comprise 80%.
Finding 3: In several countries (e.g., Laos, Indonesia), cellular
access is the dominant form of Internet connectivity and thus,
increasingly, part of these countries’ critical infrastructure.
8 CONCLUSION
This paper presents the first global analysis of cellular networks.
We described an approach to accurately identify cellular network
addresses using client browser signals and showed its effectiveness
in a range of mixed networks (i.e., networks that share both fixed-
line and cellular devices). Using this approach, we leveraged the
global vantage point of one of the world’s largest CDNs to map the
global cellular IP space and their hosting ASes, and analyzed their
traffic demand.
There are several directions we would like to explore in future
work. Though this paper presented a snapshot of cellular address
characteristics, we are exploring how cellular addresses evolve
over time, both in their assignment to cellular end-users, and how
demand shifts across cellular address space. In addition, we would
like to use our new map of cellular addresses, and our global CDN
vantage point to characterize user behavior across a wide range of
network services.
