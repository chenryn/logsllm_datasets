Baby’s First Wiretap
If you use this feature to call a third party, we will 
record the phone call and any message you leave 
for the third party, as well as call information such 
as the number dialed, the date and time of the call 
and its duration, and your location as determined 
by your area code or as otherwise permitted.

WTF
~Contacted The Bump~
Their response: “[W]e do not record phone calls. 
The language is legacy language from prior 
contemplated features for The Knot that we do not 
use in either The Knot or The Bump apps. I've sent a 
note to my legal team to update this language in our 
privacy policy.”

• Dynamic Analysis
– MITM Proxy 
• Kryptowire

Code Execution and Content Injection 
• HTML sent over plaintext and rendered 
directly.
• MITM Attacker could easily execute 
arbitrary javascript. 
Defcon 25
Account Hijacking
• Pinkpad
• WebMD Baby
• My Calendar
• The Bump
Defcon 25
Personal Information Leaks
• Why does pinkpad send 
my location to the 
server every time it 
starts?
• Email, Name, Gender, 
Pregnancy status, etc. 
Defcon 25
Look at this fucking text file
Defcon 25
Third Party Tracking
Defcon 25
Pin Locks
• 4 character limit
• Trivial to brute force
• No protection against root 
access
• “I forgot my code…”
• Probably shouldn’t rely on 
this
Defcon 25
Files Not Deleted
• The Bump
• Upload pictures of pregnancy progress, 
ultrasounds, baby photos, etc. 
• Once you delete the pictures…
• They aren’t really deleted but simply 
unlinked from your account. Still available 
on the public internet.

Certificate Pinning!
• Glow, Nurture, Eve, Clue 
all implement certificate 
pinning. 
• My bank doesn’t even do 
this! 
• Seems a little extra 
though...

Vendor Response
Defcon 25
Vendor Response
• We contacted all of the vendors that had 
security problems 
• WTE, WebMD, Preg+, Alt12, MyCalendar 
(both), Glow, Ptracker
• We received a response back from 
pTracker and Glow, who fixed the issues.
• Everyone else ignored or sent a form 
letter.
Defcon 25
More Vendor Response
Kash heard back from everyone she emailed 
about privacy and policy issues, except for 
Everyday Health Inc. (What To Expect app) 
and alt12. Companies pay attention to 
journalists… or at least better understand 
what we’re telling them about.
Defcon 25
What Can Hackers Do
• There are real threat models that none of 
these apps protect against.
• We need to convince app writers to take 
security and privacy issues more seriously. 
Defcon 25
 These apps were useful for my 
first pregnancy…
But the privacy tradeoffs might not 
be worthwhile
