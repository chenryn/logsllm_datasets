User: I am interested in learning python but my Linux skills suck. I would like to develop a medium to large scale web application using python and django but afraid the software may not work well on a windows box. Is there a performance difference in running python on Linux vs Windows? Is there anything that I should watch out for when developing the application. Also, I am aware that it is very easy integrating C++ libraries with python. Is this statement still true is the code is on a windows box?
Assistant: I've been working Py on both Windows and Linux. I favor Linux because of several things:

virtualenvs - once you start working with virtualenvs, there is no turning back.
SHELL - CMD is very frustrating when executing python/management commands in django. Also, you should add python.exe every time :).
ipython works better on Linux.
GeoDjango doesn't work on Vista/7 last time i checked. I spent 3 days trying to set it up. Just for comparison, i set GeoDjango-able development environment in 20 minutes in Linux.
Linux is free :)
Although there is no visible performance impact or incompatibility when working python cross-platform, the benefits of Linux for python development outweigh Windows by a lot. It's  a lot more comfortable and definitely will boost your productivity.

IMHO Linux is the smart choice for Python development.
