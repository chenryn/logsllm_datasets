I'm interested in learning Python, but I have limited experience with Linux. My goal is to develop a medium to large-scale web application using Python and Django, but I'm concerned that the software might not run as well on a Windows machine. Are there any performance differences between running Python on Linux versus Windows? Additionally, are there any specific considerations or potential issues I should be aware of during the development process? 

I've also heard that it's relatively straightforward to integrate C++ libraries with Python. Is this still true if the code is running on a Windows system?

I have experience working with Python on both Windows and Linux, and I prefer Linux for several reasons:

1. **Virtual Environments**: Once you start using `virtualenv` or `venv`, you'll find it indispensable. The ease of managing project-specific dependencies is much smoother on Linux.

2. **Shell**: The command-line interface (CLI) on Linux, such as Bash, is far more powerful and flexible compared to the Command Prompt (CMD) on Windows. For example, executing Python and Django management commands is more seamless, and you don't need to prepend `python.exe` every time.

3. **IPython**: IPython, an enhanced interactive Python shell, works better on Linux, providing a more robust and feature-rich environment for testing and debugging.

4. **GeoDjango**: GeoDjango, which integrates geographic data and functions into Django, can be challenging to set up on Windows, especially on older versions like Vista or Windows 7. In contrast, setting up a GeoDjango-enabled development environment on Linux can be done in a matter of minutes.

5. **Cost**: Linux distributions are typically free, which can be a significant advantage over the cost of Windows licenses.

While there may not be a noticeable performance difference between running Python on Linux and Windows, the overall development experience on Linux is generally more comfortable and productive. This is due to the availability of powerful tools, better CLI, and a more developer-friendly environment.

In my opinion, Linux is the smarter choice for Python development, particularly for projects involving Django and other complex frameworks.
