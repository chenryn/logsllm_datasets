when added into the vertices PointCloud new vertices,  
adding occurs,  
because: in function setParticleBuffers  
When copying in vertexArray of vertices,  
not all vertices are copied,  
because:  
vertexArray declared as Float32Array and Float32Array does not resize  
so I suggest:  
in function setParticleBuffers when length of vertices not equal number of
vertices in PointCloud  
re-create all the necessary Float32Array  
, and to make such changes
function setParticleBuffers(geometry, hint, object) {  
"+" if (geometry.__webglParticleCount !== geometry.vertices.length)  
"+" initParticleBuffers(geometry, object);  
var v, c, vertex, offset, color,
