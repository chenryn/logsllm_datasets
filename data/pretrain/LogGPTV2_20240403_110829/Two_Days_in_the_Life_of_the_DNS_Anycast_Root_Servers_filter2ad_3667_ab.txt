### 4. Anycast Coverage

#### 4.1 Client Geographic Distribution
To determine the geographic distribution of clients for each anycast instance, we mapped client IP addresses to their corresponding geographic locations (country and continent) and coordinates (latitude and longitude) using Digital Envoy’s NetAcuity database [10]. The database claims an accuracy rate of over 99% at the country level and 94% at the city level worldwide.

C and F-root instances are named using their respective airport codes, such as `f-lax1` for the F-root instance in Los Angeles. K-root instances are named either after the exchange points that support them or by their city names. For root server instance locations, we used the coordinates of the nearest airport to compute the great circle distance between instances and their clients.

### 4.2 Continental Distribution
Figure 3 illustrates the distribution of clients by continent for each measured instance. Comparing local and global instances, we observe that clients of most global instances are distributed worldwide. For example, the K-root global instance `linx` in London had only 28.6% of its total clients from Europe, with the rest distributed across North America (40%), South America (3.7%), Africa (1.6%), Asia (24.3%), and Oceania (1.8%). In contrast, most local instances primarily served clients from the same continent. For instance, nearly all clients of the F-root local instance in Santiago, Chile, were from South America. This constrained geographical distribution aligns with the goal of DNS anycast deployment: to provide DNS root services closer to clients.

There are exceptions among both global and local instances. For example, over 99.7% of K-root’s `tokyo` instance clients were from Asia, with 75% of these clients located within 1000 km, mostly in Japan. This instance behaves more like a local instance than a global one. Another example is the F-root local instance `lax1` in Los Angeles, which has 88% of its clients from Asia and only 10% from North America, leading to an irregular diurnal pattern in Figure 1. These abnormal client distributions result from the instances' BGP routing configurations, which are discussed in Section 4.2.

### 4.3 Distance Distribution
We also analyzed the distances between root server instances and their clients. Figure 4 shows cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) for the distances of local, global, and all instances combined for each root server. Only one curve is provided for C-root since all its instances are global.

Figure 4 indicates that most local instances serve clients who are geographically close. For example, 80% of F-root local instances' clients and 70% of K-root local instances' clients were within 1800 km. Distances for global instances are generally longer; for C-root, over 60% of clients were beyond 5000 km, and for F- and K-roots, 40% of clients were beyond 5000 km. The lower proportions of faraway clients for F and K roots can be attributed to the presence of multiple local instances worldwide, while C-root currently has only four global instances.

### 4.4 Additional Distance
To investigate whether BGP always selects the instance with the lowest delay, we used geographic proximity as a proxy for latency. A comprehensive study [6] shows that geographic distance usually correlates well with minimum network delay. We defined the serving instance as the one actually used by the client and the optimal instance as the geographically closest one from the same anycast group. We then calculated the additional distance as the difference between the distance to the serving instance and the distance to the optimal instance. An additional distance of zero indicates that the client queried the optimal instance, while a positive value suggests potential improvement.

Analyzing the CDF of additional distances (Figure 5), we found that 52% of C-root clients were served by their optimal instance, and another 40% had short additional distances. This optimized selection is due to the flat topology of the C-root anycast group. In contrast, only 35% of F-root clients and 29% of K-root clients were served by their optimal instances. Given that the speed of light in fiber is about \(2 \times 10^8\) m/s, an additional 5000 km of geographical distance adds a 25 ms delay. Our results suggest that optimizing the routing configurations of local DNS root instances could significantly reduce DNS service delays for many clients.

### 4.5 Topological Coverage
We studied the topological coverage of the Internet by anycast clouds of the C, F, and K root nameservers using RouteViews BGP tables [13] collected on January 10, 2006. We mapped each client IP address to its corresponding prefix by longest matching and determined its origin AS. Out of 21,883 ASes seen in the RouteViews tables, we observed IP addresses belonging to 19,237 ASes (approximately 88%) among our clients.

Figure 6 shows both the AS-level and prefix-level coverage for each instance relative to the total number of ASes (prefixes) seen by all instances of the three root nameservers. As expected, most global instances have higher topology coverage than local instances.

Two notable exceptions are:
1. The K-root local instance `denic` in Frankfurt, Germany, had a wider topological scope than other local instances.
2. The K-root global instance `tokyo` saw a small fraction of ASes and prefixes.

These exceptions can be explained by the BGP data. For example, the K-root instance `denic` had a high topological coverage due to a path involving a global network infrastructure, leading to a high traffic load and a large number of clients. The K-root instance `tokyo` announced a triple AS-prepended path, making it less likely to be chosen by BGP for global clients, resulting in mostly local clients.

### 4.6 Instance Affinity
Anycast improves stability by shortening AS paths, thus reducing the number of possible failure points. However, this comes at the cost of increased inconsistency among instances and transparent shifting of clients to different instances. While this route flapping is not significant for stateless UDP packets, it could pose a problem for stateful transactions such as TCP or multiple fragmented UDP packets. Recent studies [9, 16, 17] suggest that the impact of routing switches on query performance is minimal.

We observed that a small fraction of clients switched instances during the two days: 1.7% of C-root clients, 1.4% of F-root clients, and 4.7% of K-root clients (Figure 7(a)). These percentages correlate with the number of global instances each root server has (4 for C-root, 2 for F-root, and 5 for K-root), as clients of global instances are more affected by routing fluctuations.

Figure 7(b) shows the number of clients querying multiple instances. For example, the two C-root clients who requested four instances were from Brazil and Bolivia, and the three K-root clients who requested five instances were all from Uruguay. Neither C-root nor K-root had an instance in South America. For F-root, the 27 clients who requested four instances were all from the UK, where the F-root has a local instance `lcy1`, but the catchment area of this instance was limited. These clients never requested from `lcy1` but switched between `ams1`, `lga1`, `pao1`, and `sfo2`. A detailed analysis of unstable clients could help network designers decide where to place new instances.

### 5. Conclusion
From the diurnal patterns of request rates and the observed geographic clustering of clients around instances, we conclude that the current method for limiting the catchment areas of local instances is generally successful. A few exceptions, such as the F-root local instance `lax1` and the K-root local instance `denic`, drew clients from further regions due to unique routing configurations.

Instance selection by BGP is highly stable. Over a two-day period, less than 2% of C-root and F-root clients and less than 5% of K-root clients experienced an instance change. Since UDP connections are stateless, the vast majority of clients would not be harmed by such changes, apart from the unavoidable delay created by BGP convergence. Although instance flapping could be problematic for TCP's stateful connections, TCP packets constituted only 3.2% of all DNS root packets in our data sample.

Overall, the transition to anycasting by DNS root nameservers not only extended the original design limit of 13 DNS roots but also provided increased capacity and resilience, thereby improving DNS service worldwide.
