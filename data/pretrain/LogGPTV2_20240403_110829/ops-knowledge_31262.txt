User: when I run the subl command, it just pauses for a moment and doesn't give me any feedback as to what happened and doesn't open. I am currently on windows 10 running the latest sublime text 3 build. I already copied my subl.exe from my sublime text 3 directory to my system32 directory. What am I missing? I've tried subl.exe ., subl.exe detect.py, subl, subl.exe
Please help me with this setup
Assistant: You can add gitbash alias like below
open a gitbash terminal and type
    alias subl="/c/Program\ Files/Sublime\ Text\ 3/subl.exe"
then try subl . from gitbash 
you can also add permanent alias for git bash like below

Go to: C:\Users\ [youruserdirectory] \
make a .bash_profile file 
open it with text editor 
add the alias .
alias subl="/c/Program\ Files/Sublime\ Text\ 3/subl.exe"
