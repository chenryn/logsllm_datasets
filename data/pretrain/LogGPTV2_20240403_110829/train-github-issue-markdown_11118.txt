I am initiating this master/umbrella issue to track flaky end-to-end (e2e) tests for Ubernetes. At present, I believe this single issue will suffice, but as we progress, it may be necessary to break it down into sub-issues.

This issue encompasses not only the e2e tests themselves, but also any infrastructure-related flakiness, such as cluster setup and federation control plane initialization.

Below is an example of a flake that I observed yesterday:

```
$ FEDERATION=true E2E_ZONES="us-central1-f" KUBE_GCE_ZONE="us-central1-f" go run hack/e2e.go -v --up
...
