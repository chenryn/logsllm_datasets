October 10, 2004: The next large-scale attempt to block Charter ’97 and other in-
dependent websites occurred during parliamentary elections and a simultaneous 
referendum on whether to lift presidential term limits in Belarus.
On the day before the election, news correspondents were not only unable to access 
the website, but they could not telephone Charter ’97 by mobile or landline phone. In 
addition, other political opposition websites were again blocked by a filter on Beltele-
kom’s primary router. However, many Belarusian web users were better prepared for 
this attack and immediately switched to Internet proxies and anonymizers.
Unfortunately, the government had a new, effective cyber weapon in its arsenal: 
the artificial stricture – or “shaping” – of Internet bandwidth. The use of this tactic 
meant that, in principle, forbidden sites were still available, but it took anywhere 
from 5-10 minutes for their pages to load in a browser. Thus, web users were simply 
unable to gain full access to Charter ’97 and other targeted sites. Non-political Inter-
net resources were accessible as normal.

Cyber Security: Real-World Impact
Neither the Ministry of Communications nor Beltelekom made any announcement 
regarding this incident, and no official investigation was undertaken.
March 19, 2006: The next time that Belarusian websites were blocked was during 
the 2006 presidential elections. Anticipating the government’s strategy, Charter ’97 
well before the election took place offered its visitors numerous ways to circumvent 
censorship in an initiative called “Free Internet.” Due in part to those efforts, Beltele-
kom’s IP-filtering failed. However, its network “shaping,” or the selective starvation 
of specific streams of bandwidth, was again successfully employed.
On March 18, the day before the election, a censorship “test” was conducted from 
1600-1630. On election day, the sites of opposition presidential candidates, politi-
cal parties, leading independent news sources, and the international blogging site 
www.livejournal.com, which is very popular with Belarusians, were all successfully 
blocked. Beltelekom announced that the service interruptions were caused by too 
many users trying to connect to the affected sites, but no formal investigation was 
undertaken.
April 25-26, 2008: On the eve of massive street protests in Minsk, which Charter 
’97 had intended to broadcast via live webcast, the website suffered a DDoS-attack 
that paralyzed its server. This was another “test,” which lasted 30 minutes.254
On April 26 – the day of the planned demonstration – the real DDoS attack began, 
five hours before the start of the protest. The hosting company, www.theplanet.com, 
was overwhelmed. Its hardware was designed to carry up to 700 Mbit/s of network 
traffic, but the DDoS surpassed 1 Gbit/s.255 There was no alternative but to turn off 
the website and simply wait for the attack to end (on the following day).
Other independent online media were targeted simultaneously, including the Be-
larusian-language version of “Radio Liberty.” A server hosting the opposition site, 
“Belarusian Partisan,” for several days came under the control of unknown hackers, 
who used it as a platform to publish fabricated, scandalous news stories which Be-
larusian Partisan editors were forced to refute on other websites. The high level of 
expertise required for this attack strongly suggested the involvement of Belarusian 
intelligence agencies.
The technical defense capabilities of the Radio Liberty server – home to its Belaru-
sian, Albanian, Azerbaijani, Tajik, and Russian services – were sufficient to withstand 
the attack for more than 3 days. The site remained accessible, but was nonetheless 
254 For about 10 minutes, the site was difficult to access, but normal traffic was restored before the attack 
ended. The following IP addresses were used in the attack: 89.211.3.3, 122.169.49.85, 84.228.92.1, 
80.230.222.107, 212.34.43.10, 81.225.38.110, 62.215.154.167, and 62.215.117.15.

difficult to reach, and this caused a minor diplomatic scandal. The U.S. mission to 
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) issued a statement 
condemning the cyber attack. The Belarusian Ministry of Foreign Affairs denied any 
involvement.
June 8, 2009: The most recent example of a politically-motivated DDoS attack on 
Charter ’97 occurred during a political row between the governments of Russia and 
Belarus, which resulted in the imposition of Russian economic sanctions against 
Belarus and a worsening of the political situation inside Belarus itself.
The cyber attack lasted more than a week, and for a while it paralyzed the site com-
pletely. The strength of the DDoS in this case was not particularly high; only around 
five thousand IP addresses took part in it. In cooperation with our ISP, the Charter 
‘97 technical support staff was able to neutralize the attack.
Countermeasures and their effectiveness: Charter ’97 is constantly looking for 
ways to counter government censorship, but there is no foolproof solution. The situ-
ation in Belarus is best described as an effort to outmaneuver an opponent who has 
vastly more resources than they do.
Over time, Charter ’97 has found some answers in technology and in cyber security 
expertise. They moved their site to a relatively powerful, hardened server,256 built 
an intrusion detection system, and constantly monitor vulnerabilities. They use en-
cryption to access both the server and the site’s content management system. They 
have multi-tiered levels of access to both the server and the site, and they are able to 
quickly replace all passwords in the event administrators and/or journalists are ar-
rested. They have a distributed system for creating server data backups. Moreover, 
they have endeavored to master simple, open-source technologies such as UNIX, 
PHP, and MySQL.257 All told, these efforts go a long way toward preventing the com-
promise of the web server.
Charter ’97 also launched the “Free Internet” project, which provides recommen-
dations to visitors in case the site becomes unavailable. It explains how to use an 
Internet proxy, anonymizers, Virtual Private Networks (VPN), and software such 
as Tor.258 This information is rebroadcast via RSS259 and mirror websites, and visi-
tors are encouraged to disseminate it through their own blogs, chat rooms, social 
networking, etc. These measures are sufficient to overcome simple IP blocking, but 
there is still no solid countermeasure to DDoS, especially with limited resources.
256 Firewall and caching technologies are sufficient to repulse DDoS-attacks of average strength.
257 This helps with site mobility (i.e. the rapid transfer of our site to another hosting platform).

Cyber Security: Real-World Impact
Charter ’97 believes that the government’s most effective methods of censorship 
are DoS attacks and various kinds of information manipulation. For the latter, intel-
ligence operatives can insert themselves into ongoing discussions on the web in 
order to monitor or even “guide” conversations. If and when the political dialogue 
rises above a certain threshold, especially during politically sensitive points in time, 
the authorities can take action.
Government power, cyber crime, and the future: The current Belarusian govern-
ment suppresses political dissent on the Internet and flagrantly violates its own 
constitution. There is no legal basis for Internet censorship at all, much less for state-
sponsored computer hacking and DoS attacks. Furthermore, such attacks could be 
used to block any kind of information. The result is the absence of the rule of law 
within the Belarusian Internet space, and a situation in which organized, state-spon-
sored cyber crime could flourish, not only in Belarus but also beyond its borders.
There is active cooperation between Belarusian and Russian intelligence agencies in 
cyberspace, as specified in the Agreement on Cooperation of the Commonwealth of 
Independent States (CIS) in Combating Cybercrime, signed in 2000. And there are 
strong similarities between attacks on Estonia, Georgia, and the websites of human 
rights organizations in Belarus and Russia. These Internet crimes share common 
characteristics and appear to have common roots.
Civil society is threatened throughout Eastern Europe: in Belarus, Ukraine, Russia, 
Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan, governments have likely used DoS attacks as a 
tool for suppressing political dissent.
In response, a multinational, collaborative approach is required. A good start would 
be the creation of an international web hosting platform designed to support free-
dom of speech throughout Europe. It should be built by a team of international 
experts, who could improve defenses and investigate attacks based on aggregate 
data. Privacy must of course be balanced with legitimate law enforcement powers, 
but the mere creation of an international platform would enhance cyber security 
and freedom of expression in Europe, especially during important events such as 
national elections.

BIRTH OF A CONCEPT: STRATEGIC CYBER SECURITY
International Conflict in Cyberspace
Chapter 4 has demonstrated that many governments already perceive a clear con-
nection between cyber security and internal political security. But what about inter-
national conflict? To what extent can nation-states threaten their peers, and even 
defeat their rivals, in cyberspace?
In fact, all international political and military conflicts now have a cyber dimension, 
the size and impact of which are difficult to predict. Today, practically everything 
that happens in the “real world” is mirrored in cyberspace, and for national security 
planners this includes propaganda, espionage, and – to an unknown but increasing 
extent – warfare itself.
The Internet’s ubiquitous and unpredictable characteristics can make the battles 
fought in cyberspace just as important, if not more so, than events taking place on 
the ground. A brief analysis of current events proves that international cyber con-
flict is already commonplace.
Here are five illustrative examples that suggest it is no longer a question of whether 
computer hackers will take world leaders by surprise, but when and under what 
circumstances.
Chechnya 1990s: Propaganda
In the Internet era, unedited news from a war front can arrive in real-time. As a 
result, Internet users worldwide play an important role in international conflicts 
simply by posting information, in either text or image format, to a website.
Since the earliest days of the World Wide Web, Chechen guerilla fighters, armed not 
only with rifles but with digital cameras and HTML, have clearly demonstrated the 
power of Internet-enabled propaganda.
Since the earliest days of the World Wide Web, pro-Chechen and pro-Russian forces 
have waged a virtual war on the Internet, simultaneous with their conflict on the 
ground. The Chechen separatist movement in particular is considered a pioneer in 
the use of the Web as a tool for delivering powerful public relations messages. The 
skillful placement of propaganda and other information, such as the number to a 
war funds bank account in Sacramento, California, helped to unite the Chechen 
diaspora.260
260 Thomas, 2002.

Cyber Security: Real-World Impact
The most effective information, however, was not pro-Chechen, but anti-Russian. 
Digital images of bloody corpses served to turn public opinion against perceived 
Russian military excesses. In 1999, just as Kremlin officials were denying an inci-
dent in which a Chechen bus was attacked and many passengers killed, images of 
the incident appeared on the Web.261 As technology progressed, Internet surfers 
watched streaming videos of favorable Chechen military activity, such as ambushes 
on Russian military convoys.262
The Russian government admitted the need to improve its tactics in cyberspace. In 
1999, Vladimir Putin, then Russia’s Prime Minister, stated that “we surrendered this 
terrain some time ago ... but now we are entering the game again.” Moscow sought 
the help of the West in shutting down the important pro-Chechen kavkaz.org web-
site, and “the introduction of centralized military censorship regarding the war in 
the North Caucasus” was announced.263
During the second Chechen war (1999-2000), Russian officials were accused of es-
calating the cyber conflict by hacking into Chechen websites. The timing and so-
phistication of at least some of the attacks suggested nation-state involvement. For 
example, kavkaz.org (hosted in the U.S.) was reportedly knocked offline simultane-
ously with the storming by Russian special forces of a Moscow theater under siege 
by Chechen terrorists.264
Kosovo 1999: Hacking the Military
In globalized, Internet-era conflicts, anyone with a computer and a connection to the 
Internet is a potential combatant. NATO’s first major military engagement followed 
the explosive growth of the Web during the 1990s. Just as Vietnam was the world’s 
first TV war, Kosovo was its first broad-scale Internet war.
As NATO planes began to bomb Serbia, numerous pro-Serbian (or anti-Western) 
hacker groups, such as the “Black Hand,” began to attack NATO Internet infrastruc-
ture. It is unknown whether any of the hackers worked directly for the Yugoslav 
military. Regardless, their stated goal was to disrupt NATO’s military operations.265
The Black Hand, which borrowed its name from the Pan-Slavic secret society that 
helped to start World War I, claimed it could enumerate NATO’s “most important” 
computers, and that through hacking it would attempt to “delete all the data” on

them. The group claimed success on at least one U.S. Navy computer, and stated that 
it was subsequently taken off-line.266
NATO, U.S., and UK computers were all attacked during the war, via Denial-of-Service 
and virus-infected email (twenty-five different strains of viruses were detected).267 
In the U.S., the White House website was defaced, and a Secret Service investigation 
ensued. While the U.S. claimed to have suffered “no impact” on the overall war effort, 
the UK admitted to having lost at least some database information.268
At NATO Headquarters in Belgium, the attacks became a propaganda victory for 
the hackers. The NATO public affairs website for the war in Kosovo, where the or-
ganization sought to portray its side of the conflict via briefings and news updates, 
was “virtually inoperable for several days.” NATO spokesman Jamie Shea blamed 
“line saturation” on “hackers in Belgrade.” A simultaneous flood of email successfully 
choked NATO’s email server. As the organization endeavored to upgrade nearly all of 
its computer servers, the network attacks, which initially started in Belgrade, began 
to emanate from all over the world.269
Middle East 2000: Targeting the Economy
During the Cold War, the Middle East often served as a proving ground for military 
weapons and tactics. In the Internet era, it has done the same for cyber warfare.
In October 2000, following the abduction of three Israeli soldiers in Lebanon, blue 
and white flags as well as a sound file playing the Israeli national anthem were 
planted on a hacked Hizballah website. Subsequent pro-Israeli attacks targeted the 
official websites of military and political organizations perceived hostile to Israel, 
including the Palestinian National Authority, Hamas, and Iran.270
Retaliation from Pro-Palestinian hackers was quick and much more diverse in scope. 
Israeli political, military, telecommunications, media, and universities were all hit. 
The attackers specifically targeted sites of pure economic value, including the Bank 
of Israel, e-commerce, and the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. At the time, Israel was more 
wired to the Internet than all of its neighbors combined, so there was no shortage 
of targets. The “.il” country domain provided a well-defined list that pro-Palestinian 
hackers worked through methodically.

time period.

Wars often showcase new tools and tactics. During this conflict, the “Defend” DoS 
program was used to great effect by both sides, demonstrating in part that software 
can be copied more quickly than a tank or a rifle. Defend’s innovation was to con-
tinually revise the date and time of its mock Web requests; this served to defeat the 
Web-caching security mechanisms at the time.271
The Middle East cyber war demonstrated that Internet-era political conflicts can 
quickly become internationalized. For example, the Pakistan Hackerz Club penetrat-
ed the U.S.-based pro-Israel lobby AIPAC and published sensitive emails, credit card 
numbers, and contact information for some of its members.272 The telecommunica-
tions firm AT&T – clearly an international critical infrastructure service provider to 
all sectors of the world economy – was targeted for providing technical support to 
the Israeli government during the crisis.273
Since 2000, the Middle East cyber war has generally followed the conflict on the 
ground. In 2006, as tensions rose on the border between Israel and Gaza, pro-Pal-
estinian hackers shut down around 700 Israeli Internet domains, including those of 
Bank Hapoalim, Bank Otsar Ha-Hayal, BMW Israel, Subaru Israel, and McDonalds 
Israel.274
U.S. and China 2001: Patriotic Hacking
On April 26, 2001, the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) National Infrastruc-
ture Protection Center (NIPC) released Advisory 01-009:
“Citing recent events between the United States and the People’s Republic of China 
(PRC), malicious hackers have escalated web page defacements over the Internet. 
This communication is to advise network administrators of the potential for in-
creased hacker activity directed at U.S. systems .... Chinese hackers have publicly 
discussed increasing their activity during this period, which coincides with dates of 
historic significance in the PRC....”275
Tensions had risen sharply between the two countries following the U.S. bombing of 
the Chinese embassy in Belgrade in 1999, the mid-air collision of a U.S. Navy plane 
with a Chinese fighter jet over the South China Sea in 2001, and the prolonged de-
tainment of the American crew in the PRC.

Hackers on both sides of the Pacific, such as China Eagle Alliance and PoizonB0x, 
began wide-scale website defacement and built hacker portals with titles such as 
“USA Kill” and “China Killer.” When the cyber skirmishes were over, both sides 
claimed defacements and DoSs in the thousands.276
