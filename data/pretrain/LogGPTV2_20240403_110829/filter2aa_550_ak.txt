### October 10, 2004: Censorship and Cyber Attacks in Belarus

On October 10, 2004, during the parliamentary elections and a referendum on lifting presidential term limits in Belarus, the government launched a large-scale attempt to block access to Charter '97 and other independent websites. The day before the election, journalists were unable to access the website or contact Charter '97 by phone, whether mobile or landline. Additionally, other opposition websites were blocked by filters on Beltelecom’s primary router. However, many Belarusian internet users were prepared and immediately switched to using Internet proxies and anonymizers.

The government introduced a new, effective cyber tactic: artificially restricting (or "shaping") internet bandwidth. This meant that, while forbidden sites were technically still accessible, it took 5-10 minutes for their pages to load, effectively preventing full access. Non-political internet resources remained accessible as usual. Neither the Ministry of Communications nor Beltelecom made any official announcements or conducted investigations into this incident.

### March 19, 2006: Presidential Elections and Cyber Censorship

During the 2006 presidential elections, the government again attempted to block Belarusian websites. Anticipating this, Charter '97 launched an initiative called “Free Internet” well before the election, offering visitors multiple ways to circumvent censorship. While Beltelecom's IP-filtering failed, its network shaping, or selective bandwidth starvation, was successfully employed.

On March 18, a censorship "test" was conducted from 16:00 to 16:30. On election day, the websites of opposition candidates, political parties, leading independent news sources, and the popular international blogging site LiveJournal were all blocked. Beltelecom claimed the service interruptions were due to high user traffic, but no formal investigation was conducted.

### April 25-26, 2008: DDoS Attack and Street Protests

On the eve of massive street protests in Minsk, which Charter '97 intended to broadcast via live webcast, the website suffered a DDoS attack that paralyzed its server. This 30-minute test was followed by a more severe DDoS attack on April 26, five hours before the planned demonstration. The hosting company, ThePlanet.com, was overwhelmed with traffic exceeding 1 Gbit/s, forcing them to shut down the website until the attack subsided the next day.

Other independent online media, including the Belarusian-language version of Radio Liberty, were also targeted. The opposition site "Belarusian Partisan" was hacked, and used to publish fabricated, scandalous news stories. The high level of expertise required for these attacks suggested the involvement of Belarusian intelligence agencies.

Radio Liberty's server, hosting several services, managed to withstand the attack for over three days, but the site was still difficult to reach. This caused a minor diplomatic scandal, with the U.S. mission to the OSCE issuing a statement condemning the cyber attack. The Belarusian Ministry of Foreign Affairs denied any involvement.

### June 8, 2009: Political Row and DDoS Attack

During a political dispute between Russia and Belarus, which led to Russian economic sanctions and a worsening political situation in Belarus, Charter '97 experienced another politically motivated DDoS attack. The attack lasted over a week, paralyzing the site. With the help of their ISP, Charter '97's technical support staff was able to neutralize the attack, which involved around 5,000 IP addresses.

### Countermeasures and Their Effectiveness

Charter '97 continuously seeks ways to counter government censorship, though no foolproof solution exists. They have implemented various technological and cybersecurity measures, such as moving to a hardened server, building an intrusion detection system, and using encryption. They also provide recommendations for visitors through the "Free Internet" project, explaining how to use proxies, anonymizers, and tools like Tor.

While these measures can overcome simple IP blocking, there is still no solid countermeasure against DDoS attacks, especially with limited resources. Charter '97 believes that the government's most effective methods of censorship are DoS attacks and information manipulation, where intelligence operatives can monitor and guide online discussions.

### Government Power, Cyber Crime, and the Future

The current Belarusian government suppresses political dissent on the internet, violating its own constitution. There is no legal basis for internet censorship or state-sponsored hacking and DoS attacks. This creates a situation where organized, state-sponsored cyber crime can flourish, not only in Belarus but also beyond its borders.

There is active cooperation between Belarusian and Russian intelligence agencies in cyberspace, as specified in the 2000 Agreement on Cooperation of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) in Combating Cybercrime. Similarities exist between attacks on Estonia, Georgia, and human rights organizations in Belarus and Russia, suggesting common roots.

### International Conflict in Cyberspace

Many governments perceive a clear connection between cyber security and internal political security. In fact, all international political and military conflicts now have a cyber dimension. The ubiquitous and unpredictable nature of the internet makes cyber battles just as important, if not more so, than events on the ground.

### Illustrative Examples of International Cyber Conflict

#### Chechnya 1990s: Propaganda
Chechen separatists used the internet to deliver powerful propaganda, posting unedited news and images from the war front. The skillful placement of anti-Russian propaganda, including images of casualties, turned public opinion against perceived Russian military excesses.

#### Kosovo 1999: Hacking the Military
During NATO's bombing of Serbia, pro-Serbian hacker groups, such as the "Black Hand," attacked NATO's internet infrastructure. These attacks included Denial-of-Service (DoS) and virus-infected emails, causing significant disruptions.

#### Middle East 2000: Targeting the Economy
Following the abduction of Israeli soldiers in Lebanon, pro-Israeli hackers defaced Hezbollah's website. Retaliation from pro-Palestinian hackers targeted Israeli economic sites, including banks and the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. The conflict showcased new tools and tactics, such as the "Defend" DoS program.

#### U.S. and China 2001: Patriotic Hacking
Tensions between the U.S. and China, following incidents like the 1999 bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade and the 2001 mid-air collision, led to increased hacker activity. Hackers on both sides defaced thousands of websites and built hacker portals, escalating the cyber skirmishes.

These examples illustrate that international cyber conflict is already commonplace and will likely continue to be a significant aspect of global security.
