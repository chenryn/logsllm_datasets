ABSTRACT
Electronic Health Record (EHR) system facilitates us a lot
for health record management. Privacy risk of patients’
records is the dominating obstacle in the widely deployed
EHRs. Role-based access control (RBAC) schemes oﬀer an
access control on EHRs according to one’s role. Only the
medical staﬀ with roles satisfying the speciﬁed access poli-
cies can read EHRs. In existing schemes, attackers can link
patients’ identities to their doctors. Therefore, the classiﬁca-
tion of patients’ diseases are leaked without actually know-
ing patients’ EHRs. To address this problem, we present
an anonymous RBAC scheme. Not only it achieves ﬂexi-
ble access control, but also realizes privacy-preserving for
individuals. Moreover, our scheme maintains the property
of constant size for the encapsulated EHRs. The proposed
security models with semantic security and anonymity can
be proven under decisional bilinear group assumptions. Be-
sides, we provide an approach for EHR owners to search
out their targeted EHR in the anonymous system. For bet-
ter user experience, we apply “online/oﬄine” approach to
speed up data processing in our scheme. Experimental re-
sults show that the time consumption for key generation and
EHR encapsulation can be done in milliseconds.

INTRODUCTION
There is a trend for Electronic Health Record (EHR) sys-
tem to be a preferable alternative in healthcare service. An
EHR system enables users to share their health related in-
formation in an eﬃcient and ﬂexible way. For instance, to

ﬁnd one’s prescription, the patient or his doctors just need
to retrieve it from database, instead of seeking from piled-
up paper. Due to the sensitivity of health records, providing
secure storage and access to EHRs is the major challenge in
morden EHR system. As most EHRs are computerized in
cloud server, they are open to potential threats and vulnera-
ble to loss, leakage, and theft [4]. To prevent EHRs from ille-
gal access, a standard way is to encapsulate patients’ EHRs
before uploading them to server. In details, the EHR owner
encapsulates the EHR by a symmetric session key and only
the proper medical staﬀ has the access privilege to decapsu-
late. However, this solution leads to inﬂexible data sharing.
One issue is that it raises complicated key management and
repetitive encryption [16]. i.e., patients usually do not know
who will be allowed to access their EHRs, so they encap-
sulate many pieces with distinct session keys and distribute
the keys to diﬀerent medical staﬀ. This limits the ability of
patient to share their data at a coarse-grained level.
To address this problem, several schemes employing the
attribute-based encryption (ABE) have been proposed for
ﬁne-grained access control [3, 22] in EHR system. Users
whose attributes satisﬁes the access policy would be able to
decrypt the EHR data. Furthermore, some advanced models
have been presented recently. For instance, an access control
model with modular and dynamic management in EHR da-
ta [11], and a view-based access control model [10] allowing
patient to create a view on EHR data and to specify a list of
able users and not able users. Besides, the role-based access
control scheme (RBAC) [20] enables a ﬁne-grained access
control without ABE system. It oﬀers a role-based access
policy in a hierarchical identity-based broadcast encryption
(HIBBE) system. While all above proposals are shown to
achieve data conﬁdentiality very well in EHR system, pa-
tient privacy is still an open issue. i.e., a patient named Lily
, her EHR is encapsulated and stored in cloud server, which
is secure enough that no attacker can decapsulate it. How-
ever, the attackers can get her disease related information
by linking Lily to her cheif doctor. If the doctor is respon-
sible for the disease of hepatitis B, the attackers can infer
that “Lily” may carry hepatitis B without reading her EHR.
Once the information spreads, Lily may be unfair treated,
or subject to the deliberate threat of criminals. If there is an
anonymous scheme which blinds the identities during Lily’s
examination, the attackers can only get “someone” carries
hepatitis B. Thus, the patient privacy is preserved.

EHR is deﬁned by Iakovidis as “digitally stored healthcare
information about an individual’s lifetime with the purpose
of supporting continuity of care, education and research, and
ensuring conﬁdentiality at all times” [17]. The essential of
the EHR system is represented by the patients’s health data
and the ability to guarantee the conﬁdentiality of these data.
To secure patients’ data in EHR system, the mechanism of
access control [23] is widely used. Access control is usually
speciﬁed by some legislations, i.e. health insurance portabil-
ity and accountability act (HIPAA)[1], electronic documents
[2], or company regulations. It limits who can access the s-
tored EHRs and how they can operate them.
How to achieve appropriate access control is highlight-
ed and required so as to secure EHR data [24]. Existing
scheme [21] enables legitimate sharing of access rights in
a security architecture. Some proposals employing identity-
based encryption [5, 14] allow users to implement access con-
trol with security and privacy enabled approaches. Cross-
domain EHR sharing [29] and emergency EHR sharing [30]
are also presented for some speciﬁc requirements in EHR sys-
tem. Although these models have been proposed and argued
to be suitable for healthcare, they are not appealing enough
since ﬂexible access control is not available. Attribute-based
encryption [13] is one of the solutions for this problem, since
attributes can be used to describe users’ privileges, and data
owner determines the policy on who can access the data. For
instance, the scheme [22] with attribute-based encryption
achieves ﬁne-grained access in EHR system, where the data
owner stores his encrypted data in the cloud and grants ac-
cess of the data according to the users’ identity information.
For further accordance with the actual healthcare system
with hierarchical organizations, the proposals with hierarchi-
cal access control would be a preferable choice. For instance,
the scheme [16] enables scalable EHR data sharing, and also
combines identity-based and attribute-based encryption to-
gether to enforce access control policy. The role-based access
control scheme [20] with hierarchical identity-based broad-
cast encryption achieves ﬂexible access control and scalable
data sharing either.
Although a large body of schemes have been present-
ed to secure EHR data successfully, especially with a ﬁne-
grained manner, there is missing consideration for the pri-
vacy of individuals who are the owners of the shared data.
Anonymization can be used to preserve the privacy of data
[26]. An anonymous attribute-based scheme employing ABE
addressing not only the data privacy, but also the individ-
ual identity privacy [31]. Besides, an anonymous-ciphertext
policy attribute-based encryption (CPABE) is able to en-
sure security and privacy preserved ﬁne-grained access con-
trol in EHR system [25]. These prominent schemes pro-
vide detailed analysis for security, ﬂexibility and anonymity.
However, there are remaining unaddressed challenges for the
deployment in the real word, where a healthcare system is
usually structured hierarchically, with a scalable sharing of
EHRs among large amount of users. In this paper, we pro-
pose a novel idea to achieve patient privacy-preserving in
a hierarchical system. Scalable data sharing is achieved by
higher-level medical staﬀ delegating the access privilege for
the lower-level one. The delegation algorithm is used to con-
struct the hierarchical structure. Anonymous algorithm [27]
is used to achieve patient privacy-preserving.

1.1 Contribution
We propose a novel scheme to provide an anonymous role-
based ﬁne-grained access control for EHR sharing. Our
scheme employing hierarchical identity-based broadcast en-
cryption is constructed in a typical hospital system, as Fig-
ure 1 depicted. We group the patient and his responsible
medical staﬀ into a certain access policy. Every user has
one private key corresponding to his role which is used to
decapsulate the entry which in turn provides access to the
encapsulated EHR. A user can access patient EHR if and
only if his role satisfy the access policy. Scalable EHR shar-
ing is supported by allowing senior medical staﬀ to delegate
access privilege to their subordinates. To achieve identity
privacy-preserving, we blind identity related information in
the system. Third parties or attackers get no useful infor-
mation of EHRs nor patients’ identities.
Identity Privacy. Our scheme is build on a bilinear group
with two subgroups [7]. Identity-related information is hid-
den in one of the subgroup. The element in this subgroup
cannot be distinguished from a random element chosen from
the bilinear group.
Versatile Access Control. A user encapsulates the EHR with
an on-demand access policy. It enables one-to-many encryp-
tion, that is, one only needs to encapsulate EHR one time
and allows diﬀerent medical staﬀ to access it.
Constant Size Ciphertext. Our scheme achieves constant size
ciphertext no matter how many roles of medical staﬀ satisfy
the access policy. We stress that it is asymptotical optimal.
Better User Experience. The oﬄine phase executes most
computations before it knows access control policy and EHR.
The online phase rapidly assembles secret key and the en-
capsulated EHR once the speciﬁcs become known.
Anonymous Search. We provide an approach for anonymous
search such that the patient and his doctors can link them-
selves to the targeted EHR, but the outsiders cannot.
The detailed technology of Anonymous Search is speciﬁed in
full version [32].

2.2 Bilinear Groups
Let G be a group generation algorithm that takes a se-
curity parameter λ as input and outputs the description of
a bilinear group (N, G, GT , e), where p and q are two large
prime factors, G and GT are cyclic groups of order N = p· q,
and e : G × G → GT is an eﬃcient bilinear map satisfying
the following properties:
• Bilinearity: For all g, h ∈ G and all a, b ∈ ZN , e(ga, hb) =
e(g, h)ab;
• Non-degeneracy: There exists at least a generator g in
G such that e(g, g) generates GT ;
We respectively denote the two subgroups of order p and
q in G by Gp and Gq, and the two subgroups of order p and q
in GT by GT,p, GT,q, respectively. The generators of the two
subgroups Gp and Gq are denoted respectively by gp and gq.
These two subgroups additionally satisfy the orthogonality
property, i.e., ∀hp ∈ Gp, hq ∈ Gq, e(hp, hq) = 1.
Composite-order bilinear groups were ﬁrst introduced by
Boneh, Goh and Nissim [7]. This tool is now widely used for
constructing cryptographic primitives with abundant securi-
ty results [8, 18, 19]. We use bilinear groups with composite
order in this paper.
