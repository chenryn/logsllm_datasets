User: How to achieve high availability and fault tolerance, such as load balancing, container orchestration and other technologies, and analyze their principles and applicable scenarios.
Assistant: 1. Introduction to load balancing: Load balancing refers to the distribution of request traffic to multiple servers, thereby improving the availability and performance of the application system. Load balancing can be realized by hardware and software, and the software includes reverse proxy and DNS load balancing. Principle: Load balancing can implement request analysis and server selection algorithms, such as polling, shortest response time, IP hashing, etc. After the request enters the load balancing device, an algorithm is used to select a server that can process the request and forward the request. After the server returns the response data, the load balancing device returns the result to the client. Applicable scenarios: Applicable to web application systems that require a large number of requests and high availability and performance, especially large-scale e-commerce, financial, and social applications. 2. Introduction to container orchestration: Container orchestration refers to the technology of deploying and managing multiple containers in a cluster to achieve high reliability and scalability. Currently, the main container orchestration tools include Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, etc. Principle: Container orchestration organizes multiple containers into a whole, and provides functions such as automatic deployment, configuration, scaling, and recovery. Container orchestration can realize automatic management through components such as controllers, schedulers, and service discovery. When a container fails, it will automatically recover. Applicable scenarios: Applicable to large-scale distributed application systems that require rapid deployment, expansion, and management of multiple containers, such as microservices and containerized applications of Internet companies.
