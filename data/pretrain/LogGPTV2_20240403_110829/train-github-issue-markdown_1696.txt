While searching for some icons, I found the current recommended selection
limited, and some icons could not be present (e.g. Twitter, Facebook, G+,
Github, etc.) and I found myself looking at other alternatives. It seems other
projects do exist and it would be nice to recommend them instead of
duplicating the efforts.
One such project is TeamWertarbyte/mdi-material-ui which actually seems to
target this package (although `<1.0.0`) as a peer dependency.
Are there any plans to include missing SVG icons, or encourage third party
modules as such, or otherwise?
