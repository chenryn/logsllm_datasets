This article provides an overview of the Logic Trunked Radio (LTR) system, a protocol developed by E.F. Johnson in 1978 and still in use today, primarily by private companies such as taxicabs, utilities, delivery trucks, and repair services. Unlike Motorola and EDACS, which are more commonly used by public safety agencies, LTR operates with a decentralized approach, offering several unique features.

#### Decentralized Operation
In a centralized trunking system, all mobile radios must request service through a single control channel, which can create a bottleneck during periods of heavy use. Additionally, this dedicated control channel reduces the number of available voice channels. For example, a five-channel Motorola system would have one control channel and four voice channels.

LTR systems, on the other hand, use a distributed method of access. Service requests can be made on any channel, and every channel can be used for voice communications. In a five-channel LTR system, all five channels can be used for voice traffic, making more efficient use of the assigned radio frequencies. Each repeater operates independently, so if one fails, the others continue to function normally.

LTR systems can have up to 20 repeaters, each associated with a single channel, and all must be located at a single site. The repeaters are interconnected by a data bus, sharing status information about idle and busy channels and active talkgroups.

#### Digital Control Signaling
LTR uses digital control signaling combined with analog voice transmissions. Each repeater continuously transmits information in a sub-audible data stream that rides below the voice information. A 150 Hz tone transfers data at 300 bits per second, but it is typically not heard because most scanners only pass audio signals between 300 Hz and 3000 Hz.

Because LTR mobile radios always know which channels are busy, they only transmit a request for service when a channel is idle. This contrasts with other trunking systems that allow mobiles to attempt access even when all channels are full, further congesting the control channel.

#### Transmission Trunking Mode
LTR repeaters usually operate in transmission trunking mode, where the channel is used only for the duration of the transmission. When the user stops talking, the repeater releases the channel, making it available for other users. As the conversation progresses, each transmission may appear on a different radio frequency, giving the impression that the conversation "hops" from one channel to another.

Under certain circumstances, a repeater may switch to message trunking and hold a channel open for the duration of a conversation, often for telephone calls or other interconnected operations. Some other trunking systems do not immediately release the channel after the user stops talking, holding it open for a second or two to give other members of the talkgroup an opportunity to respond. This "hang time" increases waiting times for other mobile radios and can cause scanner listeners to hear a moment of dead air or system noise before the repeater turns off.

#### Mobile Identification
Each LTR mobile radio is assigned to one of the repeaters. When not involved in a call, the mobile radio listens to its "home" repeater to track idle channels and incoming calls. Each repeater can be assigned up to 250 identification codes, and the combination of home repeater number and identification code forms the "address" of a mobile radio. A typical five-repeater system can have up to 1,250 separate addresses, and the largest twenty-repeater system can have up to 5,000 addresses. An address can be assigned to an individual mobile radio or used as a group identifier.

Each LTR system also has an "area code," which is usually 0 or 1. If two LTR systems are close enough to interfere, one will be assigned area code 0 and the other area code 1. Repeaters and mobile radios will ignore transmissions with a different area code.

#### Enhancements: LTR-Net
LTR-Net is a follow-on protocol to the original LTR, providing additional features and functionality. It allows multiple sites to interconnect, enabling users to dispatch and communicate over a wider area. LTR-Net supports direct radio-to-radio communication, direct dialed telephone calls, and over-the-air radio reprogramming. It is compatible with older LTR equipment, allowing LTR and LTR-Net radios to operate together in the same talkgroup and on the same channel.

The first LTR-Net system began operation in Des Moines, Iowa, and Omaha, Nebraska, in 1998, serving customers in the construction and service industries. There is also an LTR-Net system operating in 800 MHz and 900 MHz on the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico, providing voice, data, credit card verification, and GPS position reporting to commercial customers.

E.F. Johnson also offers a different trunking system called Multi-Net, which is not compatible with LTR and is not easily decoded by scanner listeners.

#### LTR Decoding Equipment
LTR has not been a priority for Uniden's TrunkTracking scanners, likely due to the lack of public safety organizations using this protocol. However, there are a few options for hobbyists:

- **Radio Shack PRO-92 Scanner:** Built by GRE in Japan, this 500-channel scanner supports LTR, Motorola, and EDACS. There have been some firmware-related complaints, but many users report good results.
- **Optoelectronics OptoCom and OptoTrakker:** These products, based in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, offer computer-controlled receivers and add-on boxes for decoding LTR and other types of tone-controlled squelch used in non-trunked systems. They come with personal computer software for complete trunk following.

#### Finding LTR Systems
LTR operations can be found in the 800 MHz and 900 MHz frequency bands, as well as some relatively new systems in UHF. Focus your search between 851 MHz and 869 MHz for 800 MHz trunking repeaters. LTR systems are less popular with scanner listeners compared to Motorola or EDACS, and it can be challenging to determine exactly who is using the system. Many LTR systems are owned and licensed to private service providers, who sell radios and airtime to various customers.
