Welcome to Metasploit! The splash screen you see makes for very
informative reading. In [Figure
10.4](#c10.xhtml#c10-fig-0004){#c10.xhtml#R_c10-fig-0004}, there is an
explanation of why there might be a warning regarding an insecure SSL
certificate. It also explains that the Metasploit service can take
upward of 10 minutes to initialize, and if you get a 404 error, just
[]{#c10.xhtml#Page_131 .pagebreak title="131" role="doc-pagebreak"}keep
hitting the Refresh button. The URL you will navigate to in your browser
is `https://localhost:3790/`. You can use your Start menu and navigate
down to the Metasploit folder to open the Metasploit Web UI. You will
also have access to updating, starting, and stopping services as well as
resetting your password.

Please have your license that was emailed to you ready. You are going to
need it after you provide your username and password of choice. This
credential pair needs to be as robust as possible especially since this
software can provide details about your network, operating systems,
topology, and software you do not want out in the public. After you
create this initial account, you will be asked for the Metasploit
license you requested in [Lab 10.1](#c10.xhtml#c10-fea-0001). As you see
in [Figure 10.5](#c10.xhtml#c10-fig-0005){#c10.xhtml#R_c10-fig-0005},
you will need to enter the 16‐digit license and activate your license
while you are connected to the Internet.

[]{#c10.xhtml#Page_132 .pagebreak title="132" role="doc-pagebreak"}After
successful activation of your license, you are greeted with the
Metasploit Community dashboard and the default project. If you click the
blue hyperlink named `default`, you will open the overview page of a
project. Think of a project as a container that holds all your notes. In
[Figure 10.6](#c10.xhtml#c10-fig-0006){#c10.xhtml#R_c10-fig-0006}, you
see the default project overview. Since you have just installed the
software, you see there are no hosts or services discovered. There are
no vulnerabilities identified, but there are several different ways to
bring in data. You can launch a new scan, import a previous scan, launch
an ad hoc Nexpose scan, or if you have the Metasploit Pro version, use a
tool called Sonar.
![[**[Figure 10.6](#c10.xhtml#R_c10-fig-0006){#c10.xhtml#c10-fig-0006
role="doc-backlink"}:**]{.figureLabel} Exploring the default project in
Metasploit Community](Images/c10f006.jpg){.center width="550"
height="460"}
You will have to name the project, and you will want to add a
description to remind you why you created this project. The beauty of
Metasploit Community versus Framework for the beginner is this ability
to create projects through a GUI. It also makes reporting easier when
you are done with your penetration test.
So, with a unique project name and description, all the passive and
active reconnaissance you did earlier comes into play. You will need to
define the network range you want to use in this specific project. As
your strategy grows, you will the need to carve out projects for not
just your organization as a whole but for individual departments or
devices. You can create individual projects to test human resources,
marketing, engineering, and IT and give solid, logical feedback to each
department. It also allows you to do some comparative analysis and
present your findings to the proper entity, probably the person who
signed your permission slip at the beginning of this engagement.
[]{#c10.xhtml#Page_133 .pagebreak title="133" role="doc-pagebreak"}When
you enter a default network range in the beginning of project creation,
it will automatically populate the rest of the campaign. Be careful when
you are entering project scope here in the form of IP addresses. If you
make a simple mistake in just one octet of an IP address range, you
might end up testing and compromising systems that do not belong to you.
I normally triple‐check my scope in this phase of project creation so I
do not have to worry quite so much running modules based on the project
definition---I define the IP, triple‐check the range, and then check the
box to restrict the network range. This is a safeguard to keep you
within your network range. No tasks will be run against a target if
their IP address doesn\'t fall in the network range you have provided.
In [Lab 10.2](#c10.xhtml#c10-fea-0002){#c10.xhtml#R_c10-fea-0002},
you\'ll create a Metasploit Community project.

[]{#c10.xhtml#Page_135 .pagebreak title="135" role="doc-pagebreak"}By
watching the task pane, you see each of the four distinct phases. The
first phase you saw in the discovery scan was the ping. Ping determines
if an asset is online. After you know there is a response, then
Metasploit runs Nmap to identify the ports that are open and by default
will look for commonly open ports such as HTTP and SSH. The third phase
that kicked in was looking at key indicators or fingerprints of
operating systems and versions. The last action was bubbling that
information up into the project.

## Gaining Access {#c10.xhtml#head-2-74}
An *exploit* is a program that takes advantage of a vulnerability that
is on a device. Exploits can be either remote or client‐side. A remote
exploit will be the type that will focus on services running on
network‐connected machines that you have decided to target. A
client‐side exploit is the type of exploit that takes advantage of
vulnerability in software you have installed on a computer system. There
are software packages that have a reputation for being vulnerable even
after you run a patch on them. I have experienced the frustration of
patching systems, running a vulnerability scan, and then finding the
patch I just used has a vulnerability.
If you look at the data your first scan retrieved by navigating to the
Overview page, you will see there are four quadrants. So far, I have
done only a discovery scan to try to figure out what is running on my
network. As you see in [Figure
10.10](#c10.xhtml#c10-fig-0010){#c10.xhtml#R_c10-fig-0010}, the initial
scan returned 7 hosts and 26 services with 0 vulnerabilities and 0
applicable modules identified. Let\'s dig deeper into this example.
![[**[Figure 10.10](#c10.xhtml#R_c10-fig-0010){#c10.xhtml#c10-fig-0010

width="751" height="154"}
[]{#c10.xhtml#Page_136 .pagebreak title="136" role="doc-pagebreak"}If
you click the number next to the hosts identified, you will open a
detailed list of the IP address of the asset followed by a possible
hostname. It includes information such as if it was able to be followed
by the operating system, purpose, and services running. For a Metasploit
user, the last column is most important: What is the current host status
of these devices? The status could be scanned, shelled, looted, or
cracked. The status will change depending on the last action
successfully performed on that asset.
-   [Scanned---A discovery scan or import was
    completed.]{#c10.xhtml#c10-li-0026}
-   [Shelled---A session was opened.]{#c10.xhtml#c10-li-0027}
-   [Looted---Data, files, hashes, or screenshots were
    collected.]{#c10.xhtml#c10-li-0028}
-   [Cracked---The password was cracked and is now available in plain
    text.]{#c10.xhtml#c10-li-0029}
Next to Hosts on your project page, you have the Notes tab that tells
you the type of data that was retrieved on each asset. The Services tab
lists the name and protocol, port number, and current state of each
service. The Vulnerabilities tab may populate this project with a few
