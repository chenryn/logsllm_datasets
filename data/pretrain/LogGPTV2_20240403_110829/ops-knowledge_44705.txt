To effectively implement CIS Control 16.7, "Use Standard Hardening Configuration Templates for Application Infrastructure," an organization should follow these key procedures:

1. **Adopt Industry-Recommended Hardening Templates**: Utilize standard, industry-recommended hardening configuration templates for all application infrastructure components. This includes:
   - Underlying servers
   - Databases
   - Web servers
   - Cloud containers
   - Platform as a Service (PaaS) components
   - Software as a Service (SaaS) components

2. **Maintain Strong Configurations**: Ensure that in-house developed software does not weaken the hardened configurations. All custom applications and modifications should adhere to the same security standards and best practices.

3. **Asset Type and Security Function**: 
   - **Asset Type**: Applications
   - **Security Function**: Protect

By following these procedures, the organization can ensure that its application infrastructure is robustly protected against potential vulnerabilities and threats.
