 **Neale Upstone** opened **SPR-8503** and commented
When using `@ContextConfiguration` in a test `@Autowired` annotated fields get
wired, even if context:annotation-driven/ has not been specified.
This is incorrect behaviour, as it means that a test can pass against a
context configuration which when used in production will not behave that way.
A better approach would be to load the specified configuration into one
application context, and then use a child context for wiring the test fixture.
The child context can then have the additional post processors, without
polluting the application context under test.
