### System Analysis and Dependability

The system under analysis can be re-evaluated [2] by assuming that a predefined service is provided. Hence, we choose to express the service in a way that all states are considered, especially in the context of a disaster. Before time \( t \), the service is expressed as provided.

In classical dependability analysis, a set of states is defined where the required service and its dependability are expressed both qualitatively and quantitatively. The measure of service can take a value from the interval \([0,1]\) and describes the fraction of available service and failures. To introduce a quantitative measure, we first convert the fault tree into a quantitative form. This involves substituting AND gates with OR gates and vice versa. The quantitative interpretation evaluates the service level: it is 1 if some form of service is still available, and 0 if the system is in a failure state.

The quantitative interpretation of gates is as follows:
- For an AND gate \( \text{AND}_q(X_1, \ldots, X_n) = \min(X_1, \ldots, X_n) \), the minimum of its inputs represents the delivered service.
- For an OR gate \( \text{OR}_q(X_1, \ldots, X_n) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n X_i \), the average of the inputs represents the fraction of available service.

### Water-Treatment Facility: Description and Evaluation

#### Model Description
The water-treatment facility consists of two independent lines, each containing components such as softening tanks, sand filters, reservoirs, and pumps. Line 1 includes three softening tanks, three sand filters, one reservoir, and four pumps (three operational and one spare). Line 2 includes three softening tanks, two sand filters, one reservoir, and three pumps (two operational and one spare).

The components in the model can only fail in one mode and have a single repair unit per line. We consider several repair strategies: dedicated (DED), fastest repair first (FRF), and fastest failure first (FFF), with either one or two repair crews.

#### State Space and Repair Strategies
Using different repair strategies, we obtain very different state space sizes, as shown in Table 1. Each line of the system was separately modeled for the analysis. The state space size for FRF and FFF increases with the addition of a second repair crew, as it changes the number of ways repairs are done.

| Strategy | States (Line 1) | Transitions (Line 1) | States (Line 2) | Transitions (Line 2) |
|----------|-----------------|----------------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| DED      | 2048            | 22528                | 512             | 4606                 |
| FRF-1    | 111809          | 388478               | 8129            | 25838                |
| FRF-2    | 111809          | 500275               | 8129            | 33957                |
| FFF-1    | 111809          | 367106               | 8129            | 23354                |
| FFF-2    | 111809          | 478903               | 8129            | 31473                |

#### Availability
The availability for Line 1 (\( A_{\text{Line 1}} \)) and Line 2 (\( A_{\text{Line 2}} \)) are computed separately. The overall availability is given by:
\[ A_{\text{total}} = A_{\text{Line 1}} + A_{\text{Line 2}} - A_{\text{Line 1}} \cdot A_{\text{Line 2}} \]

Table 2 shows the steady-state availability for different repair strategies. Dedicated repair with two crews provides the highest availability, while one repair crew yields a significantly lower availability.

| Strategy | Line 1 | Line 2 | Combined |
|----------|--------|--------|----------|
| DED      | 0.7442018 | 0.8186317 | 0.9536063 |
| FRF-1    | 0.7225597 | 0.8101931 | 0.9473399 |
| FRF-2    | 0.7439214 | 0.8186312 | 0.9535554 |
| FFF-1    | 0.7273540 | 0.8120302 | 0.9487508 |
| FFF-2    | 0.7440022 | 0.8186662 | 0.9535790 |

#### Reliability
Reliability is defined as the set of states \( S_{\text{down}} \) for which a process line is not fully operational. In Figure 3, the reliability over time is shown for both lines. Even though Line 2 has fewer redundant components, it is more reliable due to the shorter Mean Time To Failure (MTTF) of the pumps and the higher probability of other components still operating.

#### Survivability and Costs
We analyzed the survivability of the water-treatment model after the occurrence of the following disasters:
1. All pumps in the system fail.
2. In Line 2, two Pumps, one Softener, one Sand filter, and the Reservoir fail.

From the results, we conclude that for Disaster 1, the survivability with one repair crew is the same for all repair strategies, and with two repair crews, the results are also the same. This is because only one type of component fails, making the repair order identical for these strategies.

For each repair strategy, we compute the instantaneous and accumulated costs. During normal operation, the instantaneous cost is defined by the idle cost of the repair crews. After the occurrence of a disaster, the instantaneous cost increases, and the accumulated cost decreases, converging to the idle cost for the repair crews.

### Conclusion
An additional repair crew greatly increases the availability of the system. The choice of repair strategy and the number of repair crews significantly impact the system's performance metrics, including availability, reliability, and survivability.
