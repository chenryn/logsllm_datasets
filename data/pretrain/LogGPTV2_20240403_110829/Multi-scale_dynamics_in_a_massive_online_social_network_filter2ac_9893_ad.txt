ties is an important property that reﬂects the level of cluster-
ing in the network structure. Since the network is constantly
evolving, we can compute a community size distribution for
each snapshot in time. We already observed in Figure 4(c)
that the distribution of community sizes follows a power-law.

Distribution of community lifetimes shows most communities only stay in the network for a very short time,
and are quickly merged into other communities. This indicates a high level of dynamics between communities.
Our goal
is to understand not only the instantaneous
community size distribution, but also how the distribution
changes over time as the network evolves. Thus, we com-
pute the distributions for days 401, 602, and 770; 3 speciﬁc
snapshots roughly evenly spaced out in our dataset following
the network merge event. We plot the resulting community
size distributions in Figure 5(a). The ﬁgure shows that the
three snapshots consist of a large number of small communi-
ties and a long tail of large communities, consistent with the
power-law distribution. This is consistent with other daily
snapshots as well. More importantly, these snapshots show
a gradual trend towards larger communities. Over the year
of time between snapshots 401 and 770, the number of small
communities shrunk by an order of magnitude. In turn, the
sizes of the largest communities increase signiﬁcantly.
To take a closer at how communities grow over time, we
focus on the portion of the network that is covered by a
small number of the largest communities. We take the top
ﬁve communities sorted by size, and plot the percentage of
the overall network they contain in Figure 5(b). We see
that their coverage of the network shows a clear and sus-
tained growth over time. They grow from less than 30%
around day 100 to more than 60% of the entire network by
the end of our dataset. Over time, this trend seems to indi-
cate that as the network matures, connectivity becomes uni-
formly strong throughout the main connected component,
while distinctions between communities fade.
Community Lifetime.
In a dynamic network, how
long a community remains in the network is another impor-
tant statistical property. By using our community identiﬁca-
tion method between snapshots, we measure the distribution
of community lifetime. Figure 5(c) shows that most of the
communities only stay in the network for a very short period
of time. Speciﬁcally, 20% of communities have lifetimes of
less than a day, meaning that they disappear in the next
snapshot after they are ﬁrst detected. 60% of the communi-
ties have lifetimes less than 30 days, at which point they are
merged into other communities. This shows an extremely
high level of dynamics at the community level.
4.3 Community Merging and Splitting
Community merging and splitting are the main reasons
underlying community death and birth. Therefore, under-
standing these processes in detail is critical to understanding
dynamics at the community level as a whole. We study these
processes in detail, with three questions in mind: What fac-
tors inﬂuence the split and merge processes for communi-
ties? What features, if any, are good indicators for whether
a community will merge soon? Finally, can we predict which
communities will merge together?
First, we study whether community size impacts split-
ting or merging. For splitting events, we only consider the
largest two communities resulting from the split. Similarly
for merge events, we focus on the two largest communities
merging to become one community. We use as a metric the
ratio of the size of the second largest community to the size
of the largest community. The smaller the ratio is, the larger
the size diﬀerence is between the two communities. In Fig-
ure 6(a), we plot the ratio of community splitting with a red
line and community merging with a black line. We observe
that for 78% of merged community pairs, this ratio is less
than 0.005. This reﬂects that for most merge events, there is
a large size discrepancy between the smaller community and
a larger community. This is consistent with our observation
that small communities tend to disappear over time, while
the biggest communities continue to grow in size.
The community splitting process acts in a totally diﬀerent
manner. The red line in Figure 6(a) shows that the ratio for
68% split communities pairs are more than 0.5. Thus, when
a community splits into smaller communities, the commu-
nity tends to split into two comparable size communities.
One possible explanation for this observation is that users
only have a ﬁnite amount of time or energy to devote to
online friendships, e.g. an online version of Dunbar’s Num-
ber [9]. Once a community grows beyond this number, exist-
ing users cannot continue to add more friends. This leads to
non-uniform distribution of new edges as users arrive, which
creates pockets of stronger connectivity in the community
and fragments it. The limit in social relationships has been
observed in prior measurement studies [38].
Predicting Merging.
Since community merge is the
only reason causing the death of the communities, we are
curious whether there are any structural features speciﬁc to
the merge process, and whether we can accurately predict
if a community is going to merge with another in the next
snapshot. We identify three structural metrics, including
community size, in-degree ratio, the ratio of the edges inside
a community over the sum of the degrees of nodes in the

(b) Accuracy on Merge Prediction
(c) Patterns of Merged Communities
Figure 6: Analysis of community merge and split events. (a) The distribution of the normalized size diﬀerence
between the largest two components when they split or merge. Small communities always merge into large
communities, and a community tends to split into two communities of comparable sizes. (b) The accuracy
of our prediction on whether a community will merge with another in the next snapshot. We achieve a
reasonably good accuracy of 75%.
(c) With very high probability (99%), a community merges with the
community that has the most edge connections (or the strongest tie) to itself.
community, and the similarity of a community to itself in
the previous snapshot (deﬁned in Section 4.1).
Since these metrics evolve over time, we also consider
short-term changes in these features as additional factors.
For example, consider the community size feature. We can
identify its ﬁrst order change indicator as a feature:
if a
community is smaller than its incarnation in the previous
snapshot, we use -1 to indicate the decrease. Similarly, we
use 1 to mark an increase and 0 to mark no change. For
each metric, we can also consider its second order change
indicator.
If the change in community size from snapshot
i − 1 to i is larger than the size change from snapshot i − 2
to i − 1, we use 1 to indicate acceleration in this metric.
Similarly, we use -1 to mark a deceleration in this metric.
In total, we start with the three basic metrics and add on
their standard deviation, their ﬁrst order change indicator,
and their second order change indicator.
Leveraging these feature metrics, we can now predict
whether a community will merge with another in the next
snapshot. Speciﬁcally, we apply a support vector machine
over these features, together with the age of each community.
For consistency, we do not consider communities created on
the day of the network merge with the competing network
because those changes are driven by external events. To ex-
amine the accuracy of our prediction, we compute two met-
rics: 1) the ratio of the number of communities predicted to
merge in the next snapshot to the number of communities
who actually merge, and 2) the ratio of the number of com-
munities predicted to not merge in the next snapshot to the
number of communities who do not merge.
Figure 6(b) plots our two accuracy metrics as a function
of the community age. They show that our method achieves
reasonable prediction accuracy. It achieves an average ac-
curacy of 75% in predicting community merges and 77% in
predicting no merges. This means that we can reliably track
communities’ short-term evolution.
We are also interested in predicting which destination
community a given community will merge into. After ex-
amining each merged community pair, we make an inter-
esting observation. With a very high probability (99%), a
community i will merge with another community j that has
the largest number of edges to i, or the strongest tie with
i. Figure 6(c) illustrates this trend by plotting red dots for
all merge events where a community merges with the peer
with the strongest tie, and a green triangle otherwise. The
results show that the trend is consistent over time. Thus, we
conclude that the inter-community edge count is a reliable
metric for predicting the destination of community merges.
4.4 Impact of Community on Users
To understand how communities impact users’ activity, we
compare edge creation behaviors of users inside communi-
ties to those outside of any community. Overall, our results
show that community users score higher on all dimensions of
activity measures, conﬁrming the positive inﬂuence of com-
munity on users.
Edge Inter-arrival Time.
Figure 7(a) plots the
CDF of edge inter-arrival times for community and non-
community users. We observe that users within diﬀerent
communities display similar edge inter-arrival statistics, and
merge their results into a single CDF curve for clarity. The
considerable distance between the two curves conﬁrms that
community users are more enthusiastic in expanding their
social connections than non-community users.
User Lifetime.
Next, we examine how long users stay
active after joining the network, and whether engagement
in a community drives up a user’s activity span. We deﬁne
a user i’s lifetime as the gap between the time i builds her
last edge and the time i joins the network.
Figure 7(b) plots the CDF of user lifetime for users in
diﬀerent size communities as well as non-community users.
[x, y] represents communities of size between x and y. We
ﬁnd that the lifetime distribution depends heavily on the
size of the community. The larger the community is, the
longer its constituent user’s lifetimes are. Compared to non-
community users, users engaging in a community tend to
stay active for a longer period of time. This conﬁrms the
positive impact of community on users.
In-Degree Ratio.
Although we know that commu-
nities have more edges inside than outside statistically, we
want to quantify how each user within each community con-
nect to each other. We compute each user’s in-degree ratio,
i.e. the ratio of her edge count within her community to her
degree. Figure 7(c) shows the CDF of the in-degree ratio
for users in communities of diﬀerent sizes. We observe that
users in larger communities have a larger in-degree ratio, in-
dicating that they form a greater percentage of edges within
