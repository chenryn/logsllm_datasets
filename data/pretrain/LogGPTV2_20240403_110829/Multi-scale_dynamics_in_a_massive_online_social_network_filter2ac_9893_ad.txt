**Ties and Community Structure in Evolving Networks**

Tie strength is a crucial property that reflects the level of clustering within a network structure. As networks evolve, it is essential to compute the community size distribution at each temporal snapshot. Our previous observations, as shown in Figure 4(c), indicate that the distribution of community sizes follows a power-law distribution.

### Community Size Distribution

Figure 5(a) presents the community size distributions for Days 401, 602, and 770. These three snapshots, which are roughly evenly spaced after a network merge event, all exhibit a power-law distribution. The data reveal a gradual trend towards larger communities over time. Specifically, the number of small communities decreases by an order of magnitude between Day 401 and Day 770, while the sizes of the largest communities increase significantly.

### Coverage by Top Communities

To further investigate the growth of communities, we focus on the portion of the network covered by the top five largest communities. Figure 5(b) shows that the coverage of these top communities increases from less than 30% around Day 100 to more than 60% by the end of our dataset. This trend suggests that as the network matures, connectivity becomes uniformly strong throughout the main connected component, and distinctions between communities diminish.

### Community Lifetime

In dynamic networks, the duration for which a community remains intact is another important statistical property. Using our community identification method, we measure the distribution of community lifetimes. Figure 5(c) indicates that most communities have very short lifetimes. For example, 20% of communities have lifetimes of less than a day, and 60% have lifetimes of less than 30 days before they are merged into other communities. This high turnover rate highlights the dynamic nature of community structures.

### Community Merging and Splitting

Community merging and splitting are key processes that drive the birth and death of communities. Understanding these processes is crucial for comprehending the overall dynamics of the network. We address three main questions: What factors influence the split and merge processes? Are there any features that can predict whether a community will merge soon? Can we predict which communities will merge together?

#### Impact of Community Size

We first examine the role of community size in splitting and merging. For splitting events, we consider the two largest resulting communities, and for merging events, we focus on the two largest merging communities. The ratio of the size of the second largest community to the size of the largest community is used as a metric. Figure 6(a) shows that for 78% of merged community pairs, this ratio is less than 0.005, indicating a significant size discrepancy. Conversely, for 68% of split community pairs, the ratio is greater than 0.5, suggesting that splits tend to produce two communities of comparable size.

#### Predicting Mergers

To predict whether a community will merge with another in the next snapshot, we use structural metrics such as community size, in-degree ratio, and the similarity of a community to its previous state. We also consider the first and second-order changes in these metrics. By applying a support vector machine (SVM) to these features, we achieve a prediction accuracy of 75% for merges and 77% for non-merges. Additionally, we find that a community is highly likely (99%) to merge with the community that has the strongest tie, as illustrated in Figure 6(c).

### Impact of Communities on Users

To understand the impact of communities on user activity, we compare the edge creation behaviors of users inside and outside communities. Our results show that community users are more active across all dimensions. 

#### Edge Inter-arrival Time

Figure 7(a) plots the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of edge inter-arrival times for community and non-community users. The data show that community users are more active in expanding their social connections, as indicated by the considerable distance between the CDF curves.

#### User Lifetime

Figure 7(b) shows the CDF of user lifetimes for users in different-sized communities and non-community users. The lifetime distribution is heavily dependent on community size, with larger communities having longer user lifetimes. This confirms the positive impact of community engagement on user activity.

#### In-Degree Ratio

Figure 7(c) presents the CDF of the in-degree ratio for users in communities of different sizes. Users in larger communities have a higher in-degree ratio, indicating a greater proportion of their connections are within their community.

By analyzing these various aspects, we gain a comprehensive understanding of the evolution and impact of communities in dynamic networks.
