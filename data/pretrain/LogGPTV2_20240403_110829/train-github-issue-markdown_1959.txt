Hi,
on Gentoo Linux, we see parallel build issues in all versions (including
latest 1.16.x version) for Python 3.x:
Most common failure with lapack (should come close to your defaults):
build-error_py36_with_lapack.txt
However, this is not always reproducible.
Most reproducible failure is without lapack:
build-error_py36_without_lapack.txt
