A. Train/Test split across Phone Models and Frequency Bands

bination of train/test split were explored where training and
test data come from different phone models. The y-labels
indicate the source of training data whereas the labels on
each bar indicate the source of test data. The results include
data averaged from 1-6 ft for AudioMNIST dataset. Note that
we do not assume access to training data from the victim’s
phone in any of the above cases. For cases where training
and testing data is coming from the same phone model, they
are generated from two different phones of the same model.
Evidently the accuracy levels with train/test data split across
different phone models are lower than the overall accuracy
levels where training data incorporates data from the same
phone model. We hypothesize the difference comes because
of the difference in material properties among smartphones
which affect the properties of acoustic vibrations. Nevertheless
the accuracy levels are still substantially higher than random
guessing (10%) which can result in leakage of information.
Training and test split across 60 and 77 GHz spectrum also
shows a similar trend because the phase variations are a
function of the wavelength. Fig. 25 further depicts cases where
training data is derived from two settings and tested on a third
different setting. These accuracies are higher in comparison
to cases where training data is derived from only a single
setting. This indicates that accumulating more training data

testing is conducted on a new phone model not included in
the training dataset.

in this section. From each chirp, we select
the FFT-peak
corresponding to the reflection from a phone and extract the
phase. Thus, every chirp results in a single sample that can be
converted to audio. To be more specific, the variation in phase
of the FFT-peak from the reflection of the phone is the raw
audio signal extracted from the radar. We term the frequency
of chirp transmission as the phase sampling frequency since
the phase of the FFT peak is selected and converted to audio.
The necessary chirp parameters that determine the phase
sampling frequency are:
1 Start Frequency: The starting frequency is the initial fre-
quency at which the radar starts emitting a signal. In our
system, the starting frequency is set as 77GHz.
2 Frequency Slope (MHz/µs): The TI AWR1843BOOST can
modulate the chirp frequency linearly. The frequency slope
determines the rate at which the frequency changes. In
mmSpy, we set the frequency slope as 30MHz/µs. There are

receiver is determined by this parameter. The ADC begins
sampling at the the ADC start time and ends when this
fixed number of samples have been collected. In mmSpy,
the number of ADC samples is set to 256.
7 Sample Rate: The sample rate determines the rate at which
discrete ADC samples are collected at the receiver. The TI
AWR1843BOOST has an upper limit of 25Msps for real-
valued data, and 12.5Msps for complex in-phase/quadrature
(IQ) data. mmSpy collects IQ data and the sample rate is
set as 10Msps.
8 Ramp End Time: The ramp end time determines the du-
ration for which a chirp is emitted. It also determines the
bandwidth of the transmitted signal, and consequently, the
maximum range that can be detected. The ramp end time
was set as 60µs.
9 Chirp Cycle Time: This is the sum of the idle time and the
ramp up time. One value of phase is extracted per cycle.
The important parameters for the frames are:
• No. of Chirp Loops: The number of chirp loops deter-
mines the number of chirps within a frame. It is set as
128 in our system.
• No. of Frames: The number of frames that are transmitted
and received is set as 800.
• Periodicity (ms): The periodicity of a frame is the total
duration over which a frame is transmitted and received.
In mmSpy, this is set as 10.64 milliseconds.
• Duty Cycle (%): The duty cycle of a frame is the
amount of time for which frames are actively transmitted
and received. The TI AWR1843BOOSTe requires that the
device not be used on a 100% duty cycle, so as to allow
it to cool down between frames. We use a duty cycle of
96.2%.
A few key considerations are made in setting the periodicity.
First, the lower the periodicity, the better, as that allows us to
capture more chirps within a given time period. Second, since
there is a discontinuity between frames in order to allow the
device to settle down (duty cycle is < 100). We decide to pad
phase values due to such discontinuity between two frames
with zeros. So the periodicity should be set such that the device
is able to function at the assigned periodicity and that the
number of zeros padded between frames is a discrete number.
Additionally, we decided to use the same radar parameters
for both the AWR1843 and IWR6843ISK, and we find that
the settings we have mentioned work for both. We set the
periodicity to 10.64ms as it is the smallest periodicity for
which a discrete number of zeros can be padded between
frames captured from both radars. The below equations further
elaborate on the interrelationships between various system
parameters as well as the computation of the final sampling
rate based on the chosen parameter setting.
tramp = tadc-start + tadc-sampling + tmisc
(8)
where tmisc is the time spent transmitting at the end of a chirp
cycle that is not sampled by the receiver.
tcycle = tidle + tramp

practical limitations with setting a slope higher than this. For
chirps with a small cycle time, if the slope is really high,
the received signals become noisy as the system requires
some time to cool down when transitioning quickly from
the highest to the lowest frequency.
3 Idle Time: At the end of each chirp, the system is required
to stay idle for sometime in order to avoid noise due to heat.
The idle time in mmSpy is a low 20µs.
4 TX Start Time: The TX start time determines the time the
transmitter takes to begin transmitting with respect to the
start of a cycle. In our system, this is set as a low 10µs.
the TX and ADC begin at
5 ADC Start Time: The ADC start time determines the time
the ADC (at the RX) takes to begin converting received
chirps. Note that
the same
instance of time but the TX start time can be earlier than
the ADC start time. However, in mmSpy, the TX start time
and the ADC start time are both set to 10µs in order to
avoid further overhead and time delays and maximize the
resolution of sensing.

In mmWave studio, we can specify the values of tramp and
tidle.
Let the number of chirps be given by nchirps and the number
of zero skips between two frames be given by nskips. Thus, the
frame periodicity (p) is given by:
p = (nchirps + nskips) × tcycle
(10)
In mmSpy, we set nchirps = 128 and nskips = 5. This implies,
p = (128 + 5) × tcycle = 133 · tcycle
(11)
Since one phase value is extracted from each chirp cycle, the
sampling rate Fs is given as:
Fs =
1
tcycle
(12)
We need to set tramp and tidle such that the radar can success-
fully transmit and receive. In mmSpy, we set the values as
tramp = 60µs and tidle = 20µs. Thus, tcycle = 80µs.
This implies,
Fs =
1
tcycle
= 12500Hz = 12.5kHz
(13)
and
p = 133 · 80µs = 10.64ms
(14)
Thus, the values of frame periodicity is set as 10.64ms in
mmSpy, ramp end time is set as 60µs and idle time is set
as 20µs. This results in a total bandwidth of 1798.92MHz.
For mmSpy, we downsample the audio from 12.5kHz to 8kHz.
Based on the Nyquist sampling theorem, the highest frequency
audio signal that can thus be captured is 4kHz, which is
adequate for speech recognition tasks.
C. Size of Attack Equipment
The current experimental setup is bulky. However, we note
that the actual mmWave chip as highlighted in Figure 31 is
only 2cm×2cm in size, and the dimensions of the antenna
is 2.5cm×3cm. This can be integrated into a concealed PCB
to enforce wireless wiretapping [57] and the raw data can be
streamed to a smartphone with powerful GPU via 5G com-
munication which can support Gbps data rates [28] sufficient
for streaming the raw data at 25 MHz sampling rate (same as
the sampling rate of our data acquisition device DCA1000).
The development board shown in the figure is only used in the
‘prototypying phase’ as this is the standard procedure in many
IoT applications to extensively test the prototype before rolling
out on a compact PCB [32]. Our future work will include
testing the feasibility of such a fabrication to create a smaller
attack device.

D. Attack with 5G routers
At a high level, if an adversary gains access to the physical
layer of a 5G router, or use a software-defined 5G radios
which are becoming popular [70], [71], then they can modulate
emitted radio waves. In such a scenario, it might be possible
to modulate and mix sent and received signals to replicate
an attack like mmSpy. At this point in time, this is a pre-
emptive estimate of the possibility of such an attack; one of the
reasons is that 5G has not yet fully proliferated as a popular
technology. One of the key aspects of mmSpy is the short
wavelength of the carrier wave used (which is of the order of
millimeters), which makes tiny phase changes easy to detect:
and this is a commonality that automotive radars share with
commercial 5G appliances. We already have various hardware
and open source software tools that can allow end users to
build custom WiFi hardware [58]. We believe that with time,
it will be possible to build adversarially-capable 5G hardware
based on the same prototyping tools that enable their usual
functionality.
