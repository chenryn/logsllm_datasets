Abstract—This paper proposes a Scalable Internet Bandwidth
Reservation Architecture (SIBRA) as a new approach against
DDoS attacks, which, until now, continue to be a menace on
today’s Internet. SIBRA provides scalable inter-domain resource
allocations and botnet-size independence, an important property to
realize why previous defense approaches are insufﬁcient. Botnet-
size independence enables two end hosts to set up communication
regardless of the size of distributed botnets in any Autonomous
System in the Internet. SIBRA thus ends the arms race between
DDoS attackers and defenders. Furthermore, SIBRA is based on
purely stateless operations for reservation renewal, ﬂow monitor-
ing, and policing, resulting in highly efﬁcient router operation,
which is demonstrated with a full implementation. Finally, SIBRA
supports Dynamic Interdomain Leased Lines (DILLs), offering
new business opportunities for ISPs.
I.
INTRODUCTION
A recent extensive discussion among network administrators
on the NANOG mailing list [4] pointedly reﬂects the current
state of DDoS attacks and the trickiness of suitable defenses:
defenses typically perform trafﬁc scrubbing in ISPs or in the
cloud, but attacks often surpassing 20–40 Gbps overwhelm
the upstream link bandwidth and cause congestion that trafﬁc
scrubbing cannot handle. As attacks of up to 400 Gbps have
recently been observed [5], no vital solution seems to be on the
horizon that can defend the network against such large-scale
ﬂooding attacks.
Quality of service (QoS) architectures at different granu-
larities, such as IntServ [42] and DiffServ [20], fail to provide
end-to-end trafﬁc guarantees at Internet scale: with billions
of ﬂows through the network core, routers cannot handle the
per-ﬂow state required by IntServ, whereas the behavior of
DiffServ’s trafﬁc classiﬁcation across different domains cannot
guarantee consistent end-to-end connectivity.
Network capabilities [7, 24, 30, 44, 46] are not effective
against attacks such as Coremelt [38] that build on legitimate
low-bandwidth ﬂows to swamp core network links. FLoc [24]
in particular considers bot-contaminated domains, but it is
ineffective in case of dispersed botnets.
Fair resource reservation mechanisms (per source [29], per
destination [46], per ﬂow [12, 42, 44], per computation [32],

and per class [20]) are necessary to resolve link-ﬂooding
attacks, but are not sufﬁcient: none of them provides botnet-
size independence, a critical property for viable DDoS defense.
Botnet-size independence is the property in which a legit-
imate ﬂow’s allocated bandwidth does not diminish below the
minimum allocation when the number of bots (even in other
ASes in the world) increases. Per-ﬂow and per-computation
resource allocation, for instance, will reduce their allocated
bandwidth towards 0 when the number of bots that share the
corresponding resources increases.
To illustrate the importance of botnet-size independence,
we observe how previous systems suffer from the tragedy of
the network-link commons, which refers to the problem that
the allocation of a shared resource will diminish toward an
inﬁnitesimally small allocation when many entities have the
incentive to increase their “fair share”.1 In particular, per-ﬂow
fair sharing allocations (including per-class categorization of
ﬂows) suffer from this fate, as each source has an incentive
to increase its share by simply creating more ﬂows. However,
even when the fair sharing system is not abused, the resulting
allocations are too small to be useful. To explain in more detail,
denoting N as the number of end hosts in the Internet, per-
source or per-destination schemes could ideally conduct fair
sharing of O(1/N) based on all potential sources or desti-
nations that traverse a given link. However, with increasing
hop-count distance of the link from the source or to the
destination, the number of potential sources or destinations that
traverse that link increases exponentially. Per-ﬂow reservation
performs even more poorly, allocating a bandwidth slice of
only O(1/M2) in the case of a Coremelt attack [38] between
M bots, and only O(1/M∗P) during a Crossﬁre attack [21] with
P destination servers that can be contacted. In the presence of
billions of end hosts engaged in end-to-end communication,
the allocated bandwidth becomes too small to be useful.
In this paper, we propose a Scalable Internet Bandwidth
Reservation Architecture (SIBRA), a novel bandwidth allo-
cation system that operates at Internet-scale and resolves the
drawbacks of prior systems. In a nutshell, SIBRA provides in-
terdomain bandwidth allocations, which enable construction of
Dynamic Interdomain Leased Lines (DILLs), in turn enabling
new ISP business models. SIBRA’s bandwidth reservations
guarantee a minimal amount of bandwidth to each pair of end
hosts by limiting the possible paths in end-to-end communica-
1We use this term following Garrett Hardin’s Tragedy of the Commons
[17], which according to the author has no technical solution, but instead
“requires a fundamental extension in morality”. As we should not expect
attackers to show any of the latter, we believe in a technical solution —
at least for the Internet!
tion. An important property of SIBRA is its per-ﬂow stateless
operation for reservation renewal, monitoring, and policing,
which results in scalable and efﬁcient router operation. SIBRA
is fully implemented; our evaluation demonstrates its effective-
ness.
II. GOALS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND THE ADVERSARY
link-ﬂooding
The goal of this paper is to defend against
attacks,
in which distributed attackers collude by sending
trafﬁc to each other (Coremelt [38]) or to publicly accessible
servers (Crossﬁre [21]) in order to exhaust the bandwidth of
targeted servers and Internet backbone links. In the case of
Coremelt, the trafﬁc volume might not be limited (e.g., by
TCP congestion control) since all participating hosts are under
adversarial control and can thus run any protocol. In the case
of Crossﬁre, distributed attackers collude by sending trafﬁc
to legitimate hosts in order to cut off network connections to
selected servers. We note that other known attacks constitute
a combination of the two cases above.
Adversary model. We assume that ASes may be malicious
and misbehave by sending large amounts of trafﬁc (bandwidth
requests and data packets). We furthermore assume any AS
in the world can contain malicious end hosts (e.g., as parts
of larger botnets). In particular,
there is no constraint on
the distribution of compromised end hosts. However, attacks
launched by routers (located inside ASes) that intentionally
modify, delay, or drop trafﬁc (beyond the natural drop rate)
are out of the scope of this paper.
Desired properties. Under
the deﬁned adversary model,
we postulate the following properties a link-ﬂooding-resilient
bandwidth reservation mechanism should satisfy:
• Botnet-size independence. The minimum amount of
guaranteed bandwidth per end host does not diminish with
an increasing number of bots.
• Per-ﬂow stateless operation. The mechanism’s overhead
on routers should be negligible. In particular, backbone
routers should not require per-ﬂow, per-source, or per-
destination state in the fastpath, which could lead to state
exhaustion attacks.2 Our analysis of real packet traces on
core links supports this property (Section VIII-B).
• Scalability. The costs and overhead of the system should
scale to the size of the Internet, including management
and setup, AS contracts, router and end host computation
and memory, as well as communication bandwidth.
Network assumptions. To achieve the properties we seek,
we assume (i) a network architecture that provides source-
controllable network paths, and (ii) hierarchical bandwidth
decomposition.
Concerning the ﬁrst assumption of source-controllable net-
work paths, we assume that routing paths (i.e., sequences of
AS hops) are selected from several options by bandwidth-
requesting sources (who then negotiate bandwidth with the
destination and the intermediate AS hops). There are mul-
tiple routing protocols that provide such features: Pathlet
routing [15], NIRA [45], and SCION [9, 48], where the
2A router’s fastpath handles packet processing and forwarding on the
line card, and is thus performance-critical. Routing protocols, network man-
agement, and ﬂow setup are handled by the slowpath, which typically executes
on the main router CPU and is thus less performance-critical.
source can specify a path in the packet headers, or I3 [36]
and Platypus [33], where the source speciﬁes a sequence of
forwarding nodes. We note that this ﬁrst assumption may be
of independent interest for ISPs since they may ﬁnancially
beneﬁt [23].
Our second assumption of bandwidth decomposition is
satisﬁed through a concept of domain isolation. To this end,
we leverage SCION’s isolation concept [9, 48] by grouping
ASes into independent Isolation Domains (ISDs), each with an
isolated control plane. Figure 1 depicts an example of 4 ISDs.
The two end hosts S and D in different ISDs are connected by
stitching three types of path segments together: an up-segment
from S to its ISD core, a core-segment within the Internet core
(from source ISD to destination ISD), and a down-segment
from D’s ISD core to end host D. The ISD core refers to
a set of top-tier ASes, the core ASes, that manage the ISD
(depicted with a dark background in Figure 1). Intuitively,
the isolation property yields that ASes inside an ISD can
establish paths with bandwidth guarantees to the ISD core —
independently of bandwidth reservations in other ISDs. The
bandwidth reservations for paths across ISDs will then be
based on the reservations inside the ISDs, but will be lower-
and upper-bounded for each end host. In particular, malicious
entities will not be able to congest the network.
Furthermore, we assume that each end-to-end ﬂow from
S to D can be assigned a unique, non-hijackable ﬂow identi-
ﬁer [6, 18, 28]; that ASes locally allocate resources to their
internal end hosts; and that network links can fail and exhibit
natural packet loss, which could lead to dropped reservation
requests or dropped data packets.
III. SIBRA DESIGN
This section describes the design of SIBRA,
in particular
bandwidth reservations and their enforcement. After a brief
overview, we describe SIBRA’s reservation types in detail.
A. SIBRA overview
A key insight of SIBRA is its hierarchical decomposition of
the bandwidth allocation problem to make management and
conﬁguration scale to the size of the Internet. More speciﬁcally,
SIBRA makes use of (1) core contracts: long-term contracts
amongst the core ASes of large-scale isolation domains (ISDs),
(2) steady contracts:
intermediate-term contracts amongst
ASes within an ISD, and (3) ephemeral contracts: short-term
contracts for end-to-end communication that leverage the long-
term and intermediate-term contracts.
Thanks to this three-layer decomposition, on the order of
100 large-scale ISDs (e.g., composed by sets of countries
or groups of companies) can scalably establish long-term
core paths with guaranteed bandwidth between each other
(the double continuous lines in Figure 1). Within each ISD,
providers sell bandwidth to their customers, and customers
can establish intermediate-term reservations for speciﬁc intra-
ISD paths, which we call steady paths (the dashed lines
in Figure 1). Steady paths are mostly used for connection
setup trafﬁc, but can also be used for low-bandwidth data
trafﬁc. Finally, core and steady paths in conjunction enable
the creation of short-term end-to-end reservations across ISDs,
which we call ephemeral paths (the solid green lines in
Figure 1). Ephemeral paths, in contrast to steady paths, are
used for the transmission of high-throughput data trafﬁc.

Fig. 1: Exemplary SIBRA topology with 4 isolation domains and their
ASes (the core ASes are ﬁlled). The ephemeral path (green) from end
host S to end host D is created along a steady up-path, a core path,
and a steady down-path. The attack trafﬁc (red) does not diminish
the reserved bandwidth on ephemeral paths.
SIBRA paths are established over SIBRA links whose
anatomy is depicted in Figure 2: 80% of the bandwidth of
each SIBRA link is allocated for ephemeral trafﬁc, 5% for
steady trafﬁc, and the remaining 15% for best-effort trafﬁc.
These proportions are ﬂexible system parameters; we discuss
the current choice in Section VIII-A. Note that the proportion
for steady and ephemeral trafﬁc constitutes an upper bound:
in case the ephemeral bandwidth is not fully utilized, it is
allocated to best-effort trafﬁc (Section III-D).
An important feature of SIBRA is that steady paths, besides
carrying the 5% control trafﬁc of links inside an ISD, also
