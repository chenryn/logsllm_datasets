User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Cofiguring DHCP server on ubuntu I am trying to configure DHCP server on Ubuntu but facing some problems. Steps I have followed are given below:

Step 1

# apt-get install dhcp3-server  


I faced following problem during installation.

check syslog for diagnostics. [fail]


Step 2

#vi /etc/default/dhcp3-server
INTERFACEs="eth1"


Step 3

#vi /etc/dhcp3/dhcpd.conf

option subnet-mask 255.255.255.248;
option broadcast-address 192.168.0.15;
option routers 192.168.0.9;   
dafault-lease-time 600;
 max-lease-time 7200;

subnet 192.168.0.8 netmask 255.255.255.248{
  range 192.168.0.10 192.168.0.14;    
}


Step 4

# /etc/init.d/dhcp3-server restart
*Stopping DHCP server dhcp3 [fail]
*Starting DHCP server dhcp3    
*check syslog for diagnostics. [fail]


I think I am missing something, what am I missing?

Assistant: You have a small s in INTERFACEs in Step 2, is that a typo here in the question, or is that the actual file on your computer? 

In Step 3 you have "dafault-lease-time" which should be "default-lease-time", so that could possibly also be the problem. Other minor details, that might be more of a cosmetical thing but should still be adjusted, is that you have a space before max-lease-time and that you lack a space between the subnetmask and {, also in Step 3.

If these pointers don't solve your problem, can you paste more of your syslog file to help us help you better?
