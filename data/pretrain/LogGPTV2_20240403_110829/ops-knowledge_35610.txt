I am using Mylyn 3.9.0 with PyDev 2.7.5 and the PyDev Mylyn integration 0.4.0. While Mylyn appears to build contexts correctly (as evidenced by the context tree in the task/context tab), the Python files are not visible in either the "PyDev Package Explorer" or the "Project Explorer."

### Possible Cause
The issue seems to be related to the "PyDev Navigator Content" setting.

### Solution
To resolve this, follow these steps:

1. **Disable Mylyn Focus for the Explorer View:**
   - Go to the **View Menu**.
   - Select **Customize View**.
   - Navigate to the **Content** tab.
   - Uncheck the option for **"PyDev Navigator Content"**.

After disabling "PyDev Navigator Content," the Python files should now appear correctly in both the "PyDev Package Explorer" and the "Project Explorer" when the Mylyn context is enabled.

### Additional Tip
- To prevent `.pyc` files from appearing in your context (since they are automatically compiled), add `*.pyc` to the **Preferences > Mylyn > Context > Resources** exclusion list.

This solution should help you see the Python files as expected.
