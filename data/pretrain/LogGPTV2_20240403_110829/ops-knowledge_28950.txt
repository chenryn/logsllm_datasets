User: I've heard ubuntu 9.4 will but it's still in alpha. Are there any stable distros that come with python 2.6 or at least don't depend on it so much so reinstalling python won't break anything?
Assistant: For what it's worth, Python 2.6 is available in the Portage tree for Gentoo, but it's hardmasked (that doesn't really count as stable) because apparently there are some programs that don't work with it. My guess is that if you had Gentoo, you could install Python 2.6 and get it to work, but it might not be smart to make it the default version (i.e. you'd want to keep Python 2.5 around as well).
