User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How can I make two routers to speak to each other when they both belong to two different subnet and AS? Here is my situation, I have a router R1 whose external IP address is 11.11.2.1.
I have another router R2 whose external IP address is 5.5.2.1.



I am running eBGP on R1 and R2. However, I cannot ping R2 from R1 and R1 from R2.
How can I make them to ping each other? I know that they are in a different subnet.
But, this can be a practical case where I don't want to force the external IP address to match the subnet of the other router interface.

Assistant: With out "disable connected check command" also this scenario worked for me.Added a static route to neighboring route and achieved neighbor ship.
