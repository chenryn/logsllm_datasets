unrelated to news (true positives) from 400 random samples.
The statistics are illustrated in Figure 8. When T HLen equals
to 14, the result is optimal (biggest for the product of the two
values).
Alarmed search results (T HF lag). A keyword is deemed
black if more than T HF lag search results are alarmed. We
changed T HF lag from 1 to 15, and counted the number of
keywords associated with at least T HF lag alarmed search
results and the ratio of black keywords from 400 random
samples. We show the statistics in Figure 9 and we set T HF lag
to 3 which leads to the best outcome, for acceptable accurate
more than 90%.
C. Evaluation result
We ran KDES on all 2,797,152 pages and 1,293,105 key-
words are preserved after deduplication and ﬁlter on keyword
length (7,519,504 keywords are removed). The remaining
keywords were examined by the search engine oracle and
355,583 keywords were marked black in the end.
For keywords expansion, we randomly selected 69,475 black
keywords and queried for related keywords. We did not seed all
the keywords from the last stage because of the high overhead
(9 related keywords have to be queried for one). In this stage,
we conﬁrmed 133,738 keywords, adding up to a total number
of 478,879 black keywords (there is an overlap of keywords
in these two stages).
Reviewing this sheer amount of keywords one by one
requires huge manual efforts. It turns out the core word
identiﬁcation component is very helpful: 1,522 core words
were recognized and 433,335 (90.4%) black keywords were
covered. We found many core words never known before,
like the ones obfuscated with unseen rules (more details are
given in Section V-C). Based on our discussion with Baidu’s
security team, we found that a lot of black keywords were not
yet covered, although Baidu keeps collecting black keywords
through manual inspection.
Accuracy of KDES. Due to the absence of ground truth, we
have to manually review the detected keywords and understand
its relation with the underground economy. Verifying all key-
words is not feasible under limited time, so we sampled 1,000
keywords randomly. While the meaning for some keywords
were known and clear (e.g., “海洛因” or “heroin”), we did ﬁnd
many keywords whose meaning were ambiguous (e.g., “溜冰”
or “ice skating”). For those keywords, we queried them on
Baidu Tieba (a Chinese forum), QQ groups and Baidu search,
three popular communication channels for the underground
economy, and examined the posts, chat messages, member
information and web pages (speciﬁcally images and videos) to
determine their real meaning.
In the end, we conﬁrmed 943
keywords as black (94.3% accuracy).
Presumably, black keywords should lead to artifacts (e.g.,
web pages) belong to the underground economy at higher
chances. To assess this claim, we selected 200 black keywords

and the same amount of random keywords, and compared the
toxicity of search results (the proportion of results that are
malicious, as deﬁned in [28]). The comparison result shows
black keywords are indeed good indicators, as the toxicity is
53.5%, 5.6 times of the toxicity from the random keywords
(9.5%).
V. MEASUREMENT
Based on the collected black keywords, we carried out a
comprehensive assessment about the underlying infrastructure,
the criminals behind, the impact on search engines, the overlap
with other channels and keyword transformation performed
by the adversaries. In the end, we bring to light a previously
unreported drug equipments marketplace in China.
A. Overall statistics
We manually reviewed the 1,522 core words and divided
them into 7 categories: drugs (sales of drugs, drug equipments
and etc.), dangerous items ( e.g., machine gun, daggers,
knives and etc.), gambling (online casino, gambling machines,
sports gambling and etc.), sex (pornography, adult forums
and prostitute service), blackhat SEO, surrogacy and others.
For each black keyword, we also obtained the list of URLs
that were alarmed by the scanner and the associated domains.
Table I lists the statistics regarding the black keywords in both
the extraction and the expansion stage.
During the extraction stage, 1,297 core words were identiﬁed
and the number is increased to 1,522 after expansion. Interest-
ingly, the core words from the expansion stage covered all core
words in the extraction stage, while the expansion core words
are from 133,738 keywords and the original core words are
from 355,583 keywords, suggesting that related search mainly
appends extra characters to a user’s keyword. Most of the core
words are related to sex (769, 50.5%) and gambling (503, 33%).
Comparing to other categories, these two are more popular
among ordinary web users. Our substring matching algorithm
successfully clustered the majority of the black keywords (88%
in the extraction stage and 90% in the expansion stage). The
remaining ones cannot be classiﬁed because the frequency of
such core word is under the threshold T Hf req.
Yet, we found some new business categories were not
covered by the 6 main categories, including carder (trading of
stolen credit card data), ﬁnancial fraud and medical equipments.
These minor categories also need to be inspected and we
are improving our algorithm to cover these cases. From the
black keywords, we are able to discover around 2 million
malicious URLs and 1 million malicious domains, showing
that adversaries are well funded to register many domains for
their operations.
B. Underground organizations
From the malicious pages and domains associated with the
black keywords, we could identify the behind organizations. To
make their businesses more visible to the buyers, the merchants
usually left contact information, like telephone numbers and
QQ (an IM tool popular in China) numbers, in web pages. Most
of the domain registrants provide their contact information to
registrars in China, due to the strict policies enforced there.
As such, we could trace back to the merchants and registrants
by analyzing the pages and Whois databases.
However, identifying the contact information from the web
page is not a trivial task. The scanners from security companies
and search engines are also looking for such information to
detect spam. The adversaries are aware of that and they have
applied a variety of obfuscation techniques (e.g., “4x4x5” for
“445”). Through empirical analysis on a small set of SEO
pages, we summarized a set of commonly used techniques and
devised the rules to recover the the numbers and their types
from obfuscated text. The rules are applied when a short text
resembling to a number is discovered. The mostly used rules
are removing padded blanks and delimiters (e.g., “x” and “-”),
switching letters to digits (e.g., letter “o” to digit “0”), replacing
Chinese characters (e.g., “壹” to “1”) and homophonic words
(e.g., “扣扣” to “QQ”).
In the end, we were able to extract contact information from
283,547 pages (15.3% of all malicious pages) and obtained
6,620 phone numbers and 7,272 QQ numbers. It turns out
the merchants are aggressively publishing their numbers, as
the volume of pages is far more than the amount of phone
and QQ number. Then, we queried each phone number in
ip138.com, a website providing the owner’s location based
on the carrier’s records and we retrieved 6,331 valid records.
Most of the numbers without record start with “400”, a proxy
number that avoids back-tracking. Figure 10 illustrates the
popularity of numbers within each province of China. We
found that the merchants behind the underground economy
are rather disperse: there are 30 provinces owning at least
12 phone numbers. But in the meantime, the numbers are not
evenly distributed: more developed and crowded provinces tend
to own more phone numbers (e.g., 1,311 numbers belong to
Guangdong, followed by 512 from Shandong). We classiﬁed
the phone and QQ numbers into the same categories and show
the results in Table II and Table III. Similar to the keywords
popularity, sex and gambling are the most popular categories.
Next, we looked into the domains registered for the under-
ground economy. Though in average less than two malicious
pages were hosted by each domain, there are some domains
populating a large amount of pages into the search result.
Table IV lists the top 10 domains and we discovered 5,299
URLs for the top 1 domain. By clustering the domains by their
TLD, we found .com domains are most popular, covering
34.01% of all domains. However, we found there are also
many domains registered under new gTLDs, like .top (12.41%).
Previous works have shown that new gTLDs are favored by
blackhat SEOers [8]. Our result is consistent with the prior
ﬁndings.
Among all 1,014,688 domains, we obtained the valid
Whois record for 424,498 (the remaining ones have expired,
according to Whois query). We extracted 32,970 unique
email addresses from 361,086 domains and listed the top 10
addresses in Table VI. While some emails with high rankings
do not point to the individual registrants (e.g., the user ID
