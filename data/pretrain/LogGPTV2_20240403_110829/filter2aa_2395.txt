## Challenges
- **User Experience**: Providing a good gaming experience for users with varying hardware and internet speeds.
- **SRCDS Complexity**: SRCDS is a complex piece of software that provides real-time service on non-RTOS operating systems, enforces mathematical models, distributes content, controls cheating, allows spectating, and supports remote administration.

## RCON and Server Administration
- **RCON**: A mechanism for sending game commands to the server, allowing changes to settings such as rounds, rates, levels, bans, and kicks.
- **Third-Party Scripts**: Tools like `SRCDS.py` can be used to manage RCON.
- **Security Risk**: RCON access is equivalent to shell access, so it should not be run as root.

## Third-Party Plugins
- **Custom Sounds**
- **Gameplay Modifications**
- **Protection Mechanisms**
- **Server Administration**

MetaMod and SourceMod are popular tools for plugin writers and server administrators.

## Patches and Updates
- **Automatic Updates**: Provided by Valve but can be disruptive to server admins.
- **Platform-Specific Issues**: Patches may cause issues on different platforms (e.g., AMD vs. Intel).
- **Game Bloat**: Over time, games become larger and more resource-intensive.

## Cheating
- **Built-in Mechanisms**: Customizable materials, sounds, and models can be used for both fun and unfair advantages.
- **sv_pure Variable**: Controls the use of custom content.
  - `sv_pure=0`: No enforcement
  - `sv_pure=1`: Enforces original Valve content
  - `sv_pure=2`: Disallows all custom content

## Darkstorm Cheat
- **Overview**: A publicly available cheat written in C++.
- **Injection Techniques**: Standard DLL injection methods.
- **Cheats**: Includes aimbot, speed hacks, and rapid fire.

## Wireshark Dissector
