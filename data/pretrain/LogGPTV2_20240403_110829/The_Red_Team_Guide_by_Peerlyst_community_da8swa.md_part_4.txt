![](media/image25.jpeg)This is a free and open source network scanning
tool that works in a Windows environment. It can detect and scan any
device on a network including wireless devices.
**Vulnerability Scanning**: is an inspection of the potential points of
exploit on a computer or network to identify security holes. A
vulnerability scan detects and classifies system weaknesses on
computers, networks and communications equipment and predicts the
effectiveness of countermeasures.
## Vulnerability Scanners
### OpenVAS
![](media/image26.jpeg)This is an open source tool serving as a central
service that provides vulnerability assessment tools for both
vulnerability scanning and vulnerability management.
### Nikto
Nikto is a greatly admired open source web scanner employed for
assessing the probable issues and vulnerabilities.
### ![](media/image27.jpeg)Nessus
Nessus is the world's most popular vulnerability scanner, taking the
first place in 2000, 2003, and 2006 security tools survey. Nessus
efficiently prevents network attacks by identifying weakness and
configuration errors that may be exploited to attack the network.
### ![](media/image28.jpeg)Acunetix
Acunetix Web Vulnerability Scanner is an automated web application
security testing tool that audits your web applications by checking for
vulnerabilities like SQL Injection, Cross-site scripting, and other
exploitable vulnerabilities.
### ![](media/image29.jpeg)Traceroute
Traceroute is a network utility tool which comes bundled with most
operating systems. The traceroute tool 'traces the route' from your IP
to the IP of the end host you specify. It is particularly useful in
identifying routers, firewalls and gateways which exists between you and
your target.
To run a traceroute command on a Linux based system simply type:
> ***#traceroute \***
or
> ***#traceroute \***
### Masscan
Masscan is similar to Nmap but it is more faster. As per its GitHub
repository, it is capable of sending out 10 million packets per second.
To run a 'ping sweep' using masscan simply type:
> ***#masscan \--range \ \--ping***
## Passive reconnaissance
In this section, I want to talk about footprinting using passive
reconnaissance. Passive reconnaissance is collecting host information
about the target company without communicating with any of their
systems. It's critically important to the external footprinting process
because it serves as a foundation on which we build the rest of this
chapter.
In the following list, I am highlighting some useful resources and tools
you can use to perform passive footprinting as part of the
Reconnaissance phase of an ethical hacking exercise.
### WHOIS
Starting with just a single URL, one of the first technique we can use
or utilities we can use is a WHOIS lookup. Now WHOIS is actually a
protocol, but it goes back to the early days of the internet. And the
goal of WHOIS is to connect a URL with company information. So this
would be a physical address, phone number, contact email. And the
company is assigned a unique identifier called an Autonomous System
Number or ASN. This ASN is also associated with a network range or a
list of external IP addresses. And so WHOIS is handy from a footprinting
perspective because we can go from a URL to a list of IP addresses.
### ![](media/image30.jpeg)GHDB
Google happens to be the most powerful OSINT tool for a user to perform
attacks, and forms the basis for [[GHDB -- the Google Hacking
DataBase]{.underline}](http://www.exploit-db.com/google-dorks/). Using
Google, a SQL injection attack on a random website can be performed
within 0.2 Google seconds. Specially crafted words given as input to
Google are named as dorks, or google dorks. These GHDB dorks can be used
to reveal vulnerable servers on the Internet, to gather sensitive data,
vulnerable files that are uploaded,
sub-domains, and so on. Effective usage of GHDB can make the hacking
process considerably easier. Exploit DB maintains a collection of
googledorks under a section named GHDB.
## ![](media/image31.jpeg)Search Engines
### Shodan
Shodan is a network security monitor and search engine focused on the
deep web & the internet of things such as printers, webcams, servers,
routers and other services.
### ![](media/image32.jpeg)Censys
Censys is a wonderful search engine used to get the latest and most
accurate information about any device connected to the internet, be it
servers or domain names.
You will be able to find full geographic and technical details about
ports 80 and 443 running on any server, as well as HTTP/S body content &
GET response of the target website, Chrome TLS Handshake, full SSL
Certificate Chain information, and WHOIS information.
### ![](media/image33.jpeg)Google Dorks
While investigating people or companies, a lot of IT security newbies
forget the importance of using traditional search engines for recon and
intelligence gathering.
In this case, Google Dorks can be your best friend. They have been there
since 2002 and can help you a lot in your intelligence reconnaissance.
Google Dorks are simply ways to query Google against certain information
that may be useful for your security investigation.
Search engines index a lot of information about almost anything on the
internet, including individual, companies, and their data.
For reconnaissance targeting I recommend using the following:
**Filetype**: you can use this dork to find any kind of file types.
**Ext**: can help you to find files with specific extensions (eg. .txt,
.log, etc).
**Intext**: can perform queries helps to search for specific text inside
any page.
**Intitle**: it will search for any specific words inside the page
title.
![](media/image34.jpeg)**Inurl**: will look out for mentioned words
inside the URL of any website.
You can find others Google dorks in this links:
-   
-   
### Social Media
Social media poses an interesting dilemma for many organizations. On the
one hand, these platforms are invaluable for companies for easily
sharing information about events, job postings, and new services. On the
other, they can be a treasure trove for malicious hackers and
pentesters.
### Company Websites
The target's own public website and other digital assets it hosts in the
public domain can also be used to gather information needed in further
phases of the ethical hacking exercise. Press releases issued by the
organization can also be useful as they state the names and designations
of key employees and successful technologies or projects that they have
implemented.
### Netcraft
![](media/image35.jpeg)Netcraft provides data about nearly every
website, which can be extremely useful for penetration testers. It can
be used to gather information about websites which are run by the target
information and returns information such as its IP address, hosting
provider, technology in use etc.
## DNS Tools
The greatest tool at your disposal during this phase of reconnaissance
is DNS. This Internet protocol will help you in obtaining a list of IP
addresses and match these to possible services the target is running. In
addition, DNS will also give insight into how the target's email is
being
routed, special application configurations you can derive from TXT and
SRV records and of course the IP and names of the authoritative DNS
servers.
### DNS Recon
DNSRecon is a great tool for conducting DNS Reconnaissance. The
following command
*#dnsrecon -w* where the -w option initiates a deep WHOIS record
analysis. The output of DNSRecon will provide you with the WHOIS record,
host addresses, name servers and IP addresses as well as the MX mail
records and other pertinent DNS information. To run dnscan type the
following command in the terminal \#*python dnscan -d -w -v*.
### dnscan
dnscan is another DNS reconnaissance tool, it has similar features to
DNSRecon but it comes with a DNS subdomain dictionary which is an
invaluable tool for finding subdomains for the internet domain you are
interrogating.
### dmitry
dmitry is another DNS/Web Search Footprinting Reconnaissance tools. The
command to perform a dmitry 'footprinting' scan is:
> ***#dmitry -winse \***
## Job Sites
Job sites are valuable resources for identifying technologies in use by
the target organization. Once again use Google Dorks to search these
e.g. site:indeed.com, site:monster.com, etc.

Microsoft's [Active
Directory](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/active-directory) is the most
dominant technology in environments that require the
[administration](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/administration) and
upkeep of numerous [systems](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/systems) e.g.
a workplace environment. Active Directory
[Domain](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/domain) Controllers hold a
treasure trove of information from a [Red
Teaming](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/red-teaming) perspective and can
be heavily leveraged to discover,
[enumerate](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/enumerate) and target specific
systems and technologies in
[Windows](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/windows) domains. There is often
a misconception amongst system
[administrators](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/administrators) that a
[standard](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/standard) Domain User account
with limited privileges is of little or no use to an adversary.
However, an [attacker](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/attacker) who has
gained a foothold on a system connected to an Active Directory
environment can readily use built-in Windows [command
line](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/command-line) utilities with the
privileges of a [compromised](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/compromised)
Domain User to obtain the
[network](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/network) and domain topology
information.
The [tools](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/tools) and utilities used to
achieve this can be divided into two high-level categories; ones
that come built-in on all Windows OS\'s and the ones that don't. The
latter can be challenging due to several reasons, such as lack of
[administrator](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/administrator) privileges
needed for installation, maintaining
[stealth](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/stealth) or scope of
[testing](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/testing) that prevents
installation of software on systems. The two categories referenced
earlier are as follows:
### Built-in Utilities
1.  Windows built-in utilities e.g. net, ipconfig, nltest, sc
### [Requires Download](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/download) and/or Installation
1.  SysInternal Suite\* e.g. psloggedon,
    [psexec](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/psexec), procdump
2.  Windows [Resource](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/resource) Kits e.g.
    [Server 2003](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/server-2003), 2000 and
    Remote Server Administration Kit
> e.g. [RSAT Windows 7](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/windows-7) and
> [Windows 10](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/windows-10)
3.  Miscellaneous Utilities
\*Note that the SysInternal Suite does not require installation.
This is a primer on information that can be gathered using these tools
and utilities with the privileges of a standard Domain User, who may or
may not have administrator level
[access](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/access) to the system where these
tools are being executed. For instances where an
[adversary](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/adversary) needs
administrator privileges to install and execute these tools, please
refer to the [Privilege
Escalation](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/privilege-escalation) section
of this guide to understand how this can be accomplished.
## Built-in Utilities
### Ipconfig
[Internet](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/internet)
[Protocol](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/protocol)
[configuration](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/configuration) is a
built-in Windows command line utility that can be used to configure and
display [IPv4](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/ipv4) and IPv6 network
information. Besides all the information that can be obtained from the
execution of 'ipconfig /all' on a Windows
[host](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/host), of interest to an adversary
will be the following entries that can provide information about all the
Active Directory [Domains](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/domains)
[that](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/domains) exist in the network.
ipconfig /all
1.  Primary DNS Suffix
2.  [DNS](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/dns) Suffix Search List
3.  DNS Servers
4.  Primary WINS Server
5.  Secondary WINS Server
6.  NetBIOS over Tcpip
A [Domain Controller](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/domain-controller)
in an Active Directory often runs the DNS and WINS
[services](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/services) which let this system
also perform the duties of a DNS and WINS server. This information,
therefore, can be used to discover a Domain Controller, which is the
most important system in an Active Directory. The presence and use of
NetBIOS over TCP/IP can also point to the existence and usage of a
legacy protocol that could be
[exploited](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/exploited) to gain and
escalate privileges using the excellent Responder tool.
### Nltest
Network [Location](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/location) Test (nltest)
is a built-in Windows command line utility that can be used to obtain a
list domain controllers and discover their
[trust](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/trust) relationship. The following
flags can provide useful information to an adversary.
nltest /flag
1.  /dclist:\ -- obtains a list of all domain controllers
    in the current domain to which the querying system is connected
2.  /dsgetdc:\ -- obtains the name, [IP
    address](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/ip-address), domain, forest,
    etc. of the domain controller to which the querying system is
    connected
3.  /dsgetdc:\ -- obtains the list of all domain
    controllers in the current domain from the [DNS
    server](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/dns-server) to which the
    querying system is connected. This is a useful
    [backup](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/backup), in case the /dclist
    does not provide the required information
4.  /domain_trusts:\ /server:\ --
    obtains the list and direction of trust between the existing and any
    other domain(s) that exists in the network
The following utilities require a user to establish and maintain an
authenticated [session](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/session) with the
domain controller and/or the remote system queried for information. The
Net.exe is a built-in Windows command line utility, but the remaining
tools will need to be downloaded and/or installed prior execution of
these commands.
### Net
Net.exe is a built-in Windows command line utility and used to manage
local and remote network
[resources](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/resources) and retrieve
information pertaining to user, groups,
[sessions](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/sessions), and shares. The
following flags can provide useful information to an adversary.
> *net \ /flag*
1.  accounts /domain [--
    password](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/password)
