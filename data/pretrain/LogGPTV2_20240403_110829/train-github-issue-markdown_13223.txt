The CSS snippets always show up in the auto-complete suggestions. This isn't
ideal for CSS when completing values as they insert a bunch of properties,
which isn't valid in that context. This isn't terrible as they're hidden at
the end of the list, but in the latest code, they are included randomly, with
one of them mostly (always?) showing first in the list:
See gradient, border and transition dispersed through the list, with border as
the first completion

They should be last like the old behaviour, and ideally not show up for value
completions in CSS (although perhaps there could be snippets that are valid to
be inserted in that position?)
Ideally there would be some kind of weighting or ordering to the list of
initial completions, as they seem random currently. They're not in defined
order in the source file or alphabetical. In an ideal world, Iâ€™d like the CSS
wide keywords to be kept together and listed last and property specific
features first (they're added that way when generating the file)
