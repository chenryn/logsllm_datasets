# Summary
Installing TypeScript 1.7 tooling for Visual Studio causes different behaviour
from 1.6 when publishing web applications, both from within Visual Studio
(right click > publish) and via msbuild.exe (`/p:DeployOnBuild=true`).
This issue has only been observed using a file system publish.
# Symptoms
Generated JavaScript is no longer included in the packaged / published output.
# Observations
It appears there is a difference in the MSBuild `Content` ItemGroup's
metadata. I believe that previously the generated JavaScript files were being
included in the `Content` ItemGroup as paths relative to the `.csproj` file:
    Scripts\App.js    
As of 1.7 it appears the generated JavaScript files are now being included in
`Content` as absolute paths:
    C:\Projects\Solution\Web\Scripts\App.js
Perhaps this is causing a problem for the web publishing mechanism?
