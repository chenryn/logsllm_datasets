# Summary
Upgrading to TypeScript 1.7 tooling in Visual Studio results in different behavior compared to version 1.6 when publishing web applications, both through the Visual Studio interface (right-click > publish) and via `msbuild.exe` with the `/p:DeployOnBuild=true` flag. This issue has been observed specifically when using a file system publish method.

# Symptoms
The generated JavaScript files are no longer included in the packaged or published output.

# Observations
There appears to be a difference in the MSBuild `Content` ItemGroup metadata. Previously, in TypeScript 1.6, the generated JavaScript files were included in the `Content` ItemGroup as paths relative to the `.csproj` file, such as:
```
Scripts\App.js
```
In TypeScript 1.7, the generated JavaScript files are now included in the `Content` ItemGroup as absolute paths, for example:
```
C:\Projects\Solution\Web\Scripts\App.js
```
This change in path representation may be causing issues with the web publishing mechanism.
