sparse). The x and y coordinates of each node are selected 
at random in the interval [0, m], where m is the map size. 
All  disconnected  graphs  are  ignored.  We  experimented 
with  N  =  100.  For  simplicity,  we  first  consider  a  system 
with  a  static  number  of  processes.  The  effect  of  sharp 
changes in membership is a topic of further study, and the 
results  would  be  presented  in  the  near  future.  The 
transmission  rate  is  1M  bits  per  second,  and  we  assume 
the size of each gossip message is 8N bytes (according to 
[2]).  We  set  TLB  to  100  ms  (which  is  more  than  10  ×
6400/106,  and  we  believe  this  value  is  large  enough  by 
observing the simulation results in [5, 7]). As explained in 
Section 3, we did not implement any MAC protocol in our 
simulations.  Instead,  we  assume  each  time  a  node 
transmits a message, its one-hop neighbors fail to receive 
this message with probability p. A similar assumption can 
be  found  in  [21].  We  set  Tgossip  to  10  sec  and  assume  all 
the  members  run  in  synchronized  rounds.  Each  node
