Using a session object and setting the proxies dictionary does not affect the
proxies used during a request.
ex: Still tries to use system proxy.
    s = requests.Session()
    s.proxies = {'http': None, 'https': None}
    s.post(url='http://10.0.1.1', json={'test': 'data'})
Using proxies during each request works, but it would be great to set them at
the session level. Specifically if you potentially have dozens or ".post()" or
".get()" calls throughout your script.
Any thoughts?
