CDNDescription & RationaleControlSeverityAutomatedFix ScriptAll users/identities must be granted minimum required permissions using Role Based Access Control (RBAC)Granting minimum access by leveraging RBAC feature ensures that users are granted just enough permissions to perform their tasks. This minimizes exposure of the resources in case of user/service account compromise.MediumYesNoCDN profile endpoints must use token authenticationUsing token authentication prevents Azure CDN from serving assets to unauthorized clients. This keeps other sites from 'hotlinking' content and using your assets without permissionMediumNoNoToken encryption key must be protected in a key vault (when a website generates tokens via code).Keeping secrets such as DB connection strings, passwords, keys, etc. in clear text can lead to easy compromise at various avenues during an application's lifecycle. Storing them in a key vault ensures that they are protected at rest.HighNoNoCDN endpoints must use HTTPS protocol while providing data to the client browser/machine or while fetching data from the origin serverUse of HTTPS ensures server/service authentication and protects data in transit from network layer man-in-the-middle, eavesdropping, session-hijacking attacks.HighYesYesDo not put any sensitive data in a CDN.
