**Current behavior**  
Test Repo - https://github.com/mildfuzz/angular-mockError
I am unable to test predicted HTTP error responses. Mockbackend can either
send a response with an error code (which my app treats as a successful
response in the test environment, but as an error in real world)
I am unable to send status codes with an error response in my tests, so I can
not test any error handling my application might implements.
**Expected behavior**  
at least one of the defined test cases passes
**Minimal reproduction of the problem with instructions**  
Test Repo - https://github.com/mildfuzz/angular-mockError
this is a re-opening of issue #7471, which was closed due to lack of repro
steps.
**What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**  
To be able to test all responses
