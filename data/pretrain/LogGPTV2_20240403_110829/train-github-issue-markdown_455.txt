The docs pages for Send and Sync show duplicated and incorrect items in the
"Implementors" section.
Specifically, an incorrect positive impl for `Rc` is present and the correct
negative impl is present twice.  
Also, impls for `Arc` and `ArcInner` appear multiple times, with and without
trait bounds and `where` clauses, with `Arc` having three appearances:
    impl Send for Arc where T: Send + Sync
    impl Send for Arc
    impl Send for Arc
