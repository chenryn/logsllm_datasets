User: I am developing a python application (a package) that can be distributed with distutils. 
I need to share it with someone that does not have python installed.
Is it possible to bundle the entire package and distribute it with docker?
Assistant: If they have docker then you can distribute your whole application as a docker image. This is the main docker use-case.
