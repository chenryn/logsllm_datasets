## Abstract
Despite the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) standardizing IPv6 over 15 years ago, IPv4 remains the predominant Internet protocol. On June 8th, 2011, major content and service providers coordinated a large-scale IPv6 test-run, known as the World IPv6 Day. This paper compares IPv6 activity before, during, and after this event by analyzing traffic traces from a large European Internet Exchange Point (IXP) and a major US university campus. We examine traffic volume, application mix, and the use of tunneling protocols for transporting IPv6 packets.

At the IXP, native IPv6 traffic nearly doubled during the World IPv6 Day, while changes in tunneled traffic were minimal. At the university, IPv6 traffic increased from 3–6 GB/day to over 130 GB/day, accompanied by significant shifts in the application and HTTP destination mix. Our results also indicate that many participants kept their IPv6 support online even after the test period, suggesting they did not encounter significant issues.

## 1. Introduction
IPv4 has successfully supported the Internet's growth since its introduction in 1981. However, the exhaustion of the IPv4 address space has led to the standardization of IPv6, which offers a significantly larger address space. The transition from IPv4 to IPv6 has been slow, partly due to limited IPv6 content availability and network operators' concerns about disrupting critical services. To address these challenges, several operators coordinated the World IPv6 Day on June 8th, 2011, where participants enabled IPv6 support in parts of their networks. Participants included Comcast, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and others. Their observations, reported at the IETF 81 meeting, highlighted a significant and sustained increase in IPv6 traffic, along with increased awareness and valuable real-world deployment insights.

In this paper, we complement these operational observations by investigating IPv6 traffic characteristics from two vantage points: a large European IXP and a major US university. Our study focuses on traffic volume, tunneling mechanisms, application mix, and major traffic contributors. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic study of the World IPv6 Day's impact. Our key findings include:

- **Traffic Volume:** Both traces show a steep and sustained increase in IPv6 traffic. Native IPv6 traffic doubled at the IXP and increased more than 20-fold at the university.
- **Tunneling Mechanisms:** Encapsulated packets contribute a large fraction of IPv6 traffic at the IXP, with Teredo tunnels being widespread but mostly idle.
- **Application Mix:** The application mix of native and 6in4 IPv6 traffic changed fundamentally, now resembling IPv4 traffic.
- **Traffic Contributors:** YouTube became the main contributor at the university, while a large content provider was the main contributor at the IXP.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides details about our data sets. Sections 3 and 4 investigate overall IPv6 traffic volume, tunnel encapsulations, and the application mix. Section 5 identifies the main traffic contributors before, during, and after the World IPv6 Day. Section 6 presents related work, and Section 7 summarizes our results.

## 2. Data Sets
Our analysis is based on network traffic gathered at the Internet uplink of a major US university and a large European IXP. Table 1 provides an overview of our data sets.

| Name | Type | Location | Start Date | Duration |
|------|------|----------|------------|----------|
| JUN1 | Packet | Campus | Thu, Jun 2 | 9 d |
| JUN2 | Packet | Campus | Fri, Jun 17 | 4 d |
| JUN3 | Packet | Campus | Fri, Jun 24 | 7 d |
| IXP1 | sFlow | IXP | Wed, Jun 1 | 22 d |
| IXP2 | sFlow | IXP | Mon, Aug 8 | 7 d |

We analyze native IPv6 traffic and commonly used tunnel encapsulation methods, including Teredo (RFC 4380), 6in4 (RFC 4212), and AYIYA. Some tunneled traffic can be detected by filtering on specific UDP ports, such as Teredo (UDP port 3544) and AYIYA (UDP port 5072). 6in4 uses IP protocol number 41. In all analyses, we verified that the tunnel payload contains an IPv6 packet to avoid false positives.

### 2.1. Internet Exchange Point (IXP)
The IXP data sets consist of anonymized sampled sFlow records from the entire traffic exchanged at the IXP, which interconnects over 400 networks. sFlow samples one out of \( n \) packets and exports the initial portion as a record. The sFlow probes at the IXP use a sampling ratio of 1:214. We use a customized version of sflowtool to extract relevant portions from the sFlow data.

### 2.2. US University
Our analysis of IPv6 traffic at the US university campus is based on packet-level traces collected at the university’s central uplink to the Internet. We limited the trace collection to native IPv6 traffic, 6in4 encapsulated traffic, and IPv4 traffic on Teredo’s well-known UDP port. We then analyzed these traces using a customized version of the Bro IDS capable of analyzing tunneled IPv6 traffic.

## 3. Traffic Volume and Tunneling
We begin by examining the overall volume of IPv6 traffic before, during, and after the World IPv6 Day. This helps calibrate expectations for subsequent analyses of protocols, applications, and traffic contributors.

Figures 1 and 2 plot the total bandwidth of IPv6 traffic (native and tunneled) over time at the IXP and the US university, respectively. The World IPv6 Day is highlighted by a gray bar. Before the official start of the World IPv6 Day, IPv6 traffic began to ramp up as content providers enabled IPv6 on their systems. During the event, we observed a 30% increase in IPv6 traffic at the IXP and an increase from 3–6 GB/day to over 130 GB at the university. The IPv6 traffic volume remained high after the event, indicating that many participants kept their IPv6 support enabled, suggesting they did not encounter significant problems. This is consistent with other reports [1, 9, 15].

Analyzing IPv6 traffic in 1-hour bins reveals a clear time-of-day pattern. During and after the World IPv6 Day, the traffic volume during peak hours increased significantly, while off-peak traffic remained unchanged, indicating that only peak usage changed, not baseline activity.

Next, we examine the proportion of tunneled versus native IPv6 traffic. At the university campus, there was little tunneled traffic. At the IXP, tunneled traffic was more common. Figure 3 shows the IPv6 volume by tunnel encapsulation type for the IXP data sets. During and after the World IPv6 Day, we observed a significant increase in native IPv6 traffic, while tunneled traffic remained essentially unchanged. The fraction of tunneled traffic decreased from 69% to 58% on average.

Figure 4 compares the packet size distributions of IPv4 and IPv6 traffic during the World IPv6 Day. We removed tunnel headers and plotted the size of the innermost IPv4 or IPv6 packet. IPv4 showed the usual distribution with peaks at small packet sizes (32%) and large packet sizes (≥1,492 bytes, 25%). The packet size distribution for IPv6 at the US university resembled IPv4, but with slightly larger "small" packets due to the larger IPv6 header. An additional mode at 1,280 bytes for IPv6 represents the minimum MTU for IPv6 (RFC 2460) and the recommended MTU for tunneling mechanisms (RFC 4380, RFC 4212).

The IXP showed a different packet size distribution for IPv6, with a significantly larger fraction of small packets (over 82% at most 72 bytes). We observed two modes in the distribution of larger packets: one at the full MTU and another at 1,280 bytes. The latter was more pronounced than in the campus data set.

To understand this disparity, we examined the IPv6 packet size distribution at the IXP by breaking it down according to the type of packet encapsulation. Figure 5 compares the IPv6 packet size distributions for native, 6in4, Teredo, and AYIYA packets. We found strong differences between different encapsulation techniques. Native IPv6 traffic was the only significant source of full-sized 1,500-byte packets, as tunneled traffic needs room for additional encapsulation headers. Despite the native IPv6 traffic in the campus data set, we still observed larger fractions of small packets and a stronger mode at 1,280 bytes. While the packet size distributions for native, 6in4, and AYIYA traffic showed some similarities to IPv4, 98% of Teredo packets were small. Closer examination revealed that at our vantage point, Teredo was mostly composed of control traffic: 76% of all observed Teredo packets were keep-alive messages (IPv6 headers without payload), and 23% were ICMP messages. Since Teredo contributed 62% of IPv6 packets during the IPv6 day, we concluded that Teredo skewed the overall packet size distribution dramatically.

## 4. Application Mix
We next examine the application layer protocol mix of IPv6 traffic. We used Bro’s dynamic protocol detection framework to classify application layer protocols in the university data sets. For the IXP data set, which provided only sampled packet headers, we relied on well-known port numbers to identify applications. We used a selection of 86 well-known ports, which have been shown to work reasonably well [11]. We report the top protocols and aggregate other traffic on well-known ports into the category "well-known." If the port numbers did not allow us to infer the application layer protocol, we attributed the traffic to the "unknown" category.

Figure 6 shows the daily application mix for native IPv6 traffic at the IXP for IXP1 and IXP2. The World IPv6 Day is highlighted by a red rectangle, and IXP1 and IXP2 are separated by a red vertical line. Prior to the World IPv6 Day, NNTP was the strongest contributor, accounting for about 40% of the volume, a protocol frequently used for file-sharing [7]. While we cannot reliably identify P2P traffic in the IXP dataset, its share must be less than 30% (sum of "well-known" and "unknown" categories). In contrast, Labovitz [8] reports P2P as the main contributor in IPv6 traffic before the World IPv6 Day, with 61% of the total volume. ICMPv6 contributed 10% to 13% of the overall traffic volume. During the World IPv6 Day, the application mix changed substantially. HTTP dominated with more than 60% of the traffic volume, while NNTP dropped to 7% and ICMP to 6%. After the World IPv6 Day, the application mix remained similar, with HTTP losing about 7% to 10% of its popularity.
