##### SUMMARY
All users need all the time to support optional parameteres when using
modules. Eg for group module for gid the "" or 0 etc. are not suitable values:
  * group:  
gid: '{{ user.gid | default("") }}'  
...
  * user:  
uid: '{{ user.uid | default("") }}'  
...
So for group, user etc. modules there is needed to be duplicate code to
support if parameter is defined or not (and module's default value should be
used). Now the duplicated code would eg. use when clause to have the wanted
functionality. It's bad.
Could Ansible have default value to support this?
