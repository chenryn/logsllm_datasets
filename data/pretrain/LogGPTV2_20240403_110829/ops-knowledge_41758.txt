User: I want to delete all files in a folder that are less than 200 kB in size.
Just want to be sure here, when i do a ls -la on my macbook, the file size says 171 or 143, I am assuming this is kb correct?
Assistant: Generally ls -la is in bytes.
If you want it in "human readable" form, use the command ls -alh.
