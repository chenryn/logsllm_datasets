To delete all files in a folder that are less than 200 KB in size, you can use the following command:

```bash
find /path/to/folder -type f -size -200k -delete
```

Regarding your question about the `ls -la` command on your MacBook: the file sizes displayed by `ls -la` are in bytes. If you see a file size of 171 or 143, it means the file is 171 bytes or 143 bytes, respectively.

If you prefer to view file sizes in a more human-readable format (e.g., KB, MB), you can use the `ls -alh` command instead. This will display the file sizes in a format like `171B` or `143B` for bytes, and `171K` or `143K` for kilobytes.

Hereâ€™s an example of how to use `ls -alh`:

```bash
ls -alh /path/to/folder
```

This will give you a clearer understanding of the file sizes in the specified folder.
