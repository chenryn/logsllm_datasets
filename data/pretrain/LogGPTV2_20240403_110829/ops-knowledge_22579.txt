User: Is there a neat archiving library that automatically handles archiving a folder or directories for you out there?
I am using Jython, so Java libs are also open for use.
-UPDATE-
Also Im looking for timestamp archiving. ie 
archive-dir/2008/11/16/zipfilebypreference.zip
then the next day call it again and it creates another folder.
Im sure there is something out there on the internet, who knows?
Assistant: You can use java.util.zip, when I was using Jython the built in zip library in python didn't work
