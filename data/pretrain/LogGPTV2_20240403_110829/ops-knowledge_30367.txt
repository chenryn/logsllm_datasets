I have a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) device that supports multiple GATT services. My goal is to access and read data from the characteristics of these services using a Linux computer, which is running BlueZ version 5.37. I have enabled the experimental mode, which should provide full GATT support. However, when I use BlueZ's DBus API, it only exposes the `org.bluez.GattManager1` interface for the connected device, rather than the `org.bluez.GattCharacteristic1` and `org.bluez.GattService1` interfaces that I need.

The BLE device is successfully connected and paired, and I am at a loss as to why the necessary interfaces are not available. I am using Python along with the DBus module to interact with BlueZ. 

If anyone has insights or suggestions on what might be causing this issue, or how to resolve it, I would greatly appreciate your help.

**Update:**
A system update resolved the problem.
