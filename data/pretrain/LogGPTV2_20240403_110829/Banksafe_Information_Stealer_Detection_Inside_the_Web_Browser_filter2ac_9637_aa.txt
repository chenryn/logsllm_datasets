## Abstract
Information stealers and banking trojans have become the preferred tools for cybercriminals in various forms of cyber fraud. Traditional security measures, such as common antivirus solutions, currently do not provide adequate reactive or proactive detection for this type of malware. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach called Banksafe, which detects banking trojan infections from within the web browser. Banksafe identifies attempts by unauthorized software to manipulate the browser's networking libraries, a technique commonly used by widespread information stealer trojans. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution through evaluations of sample sets consisting of several malware families targeting the Microsoft Windows operating system. Additionally, we show that our approach effectively prevents false positives.

## 1. Introduction
Information stealers, particularly banking trojans, are a form of crimeware specialized in stealing login credentials and manipulating online banking transactions during communication between an infected computer and bank servers. While most of these trojans focus on stealing money from victims' bank accounts, their functionality is more broadly described as versatile information stealers with backdoor capabilities to create botnets. These botnets can send email and instant-messaging spam, install additional malware, and execute distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.

Recent variants of these trojans use advanced techniques to hijack systems, allowing cybercriminals to extract account details from virtually any web-based login system that lacks additional security measures like security tokens. Some criminal groups have even expanded their arsenal to include mobile phone malware, enabling them to intercept login credentials for Mobile-TAN systems [12]. Some trojans can also intercept FTP login credentials and search the victim's hard drive for specific files, such as confidential documents or private keys of digital certificates. Stolen data and files are typically uploaded to dropzone servers, where botmasters can collect and monetize the information or sell it on underground forums.

The advantages for cybercriminals in using off-the-shelf information stealers include outsourcing development to parties that supply extensively tested and regularly updated software. This business model, adopted from traditional markets, ensures reliable functionality and evasion of common security software. The large-scale sale of crimeware kits also leads to the emergence of numerous, often smaller, botnets, complicating efforts to track and shut them down.

These trojans are versatile tools capable of stealing various types of information, leading to diverse attack schemes. Mass web-based attacks, such as drive-by-downloads and social engineering tricks, infect thousands of internet users. In contrast, targeted attacks against businesses and governmental organizations use spear-phishing, where victims are tricked into executing malware via emails with sophisticated social engineering schemes. For example, in October 2010, a group of criminals was arrested after stealing over $70 million from the bank accounts of at least 390 small and medium-sized businesses in the United States, using spear-phishing [18].

In this paper, we make the following contributions:
- We demonstrate that traditional security measures, including signature-based detection and behavior blockers, fail to protect users against banking trojan infections.
- We propose Banksafe, a method for proactively detecting banking trojan infections.
- We show that Banksafe can reliably detect and identify prevalent banking trojans, including Zeus, Spyeye, Patcher, Carberp, Silentbanker, and Bebloh.

The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of related work. Section 3 discusses the most prominent information stealers found in the wild. Section 4 describes our approach for detecting and classifying these trojans by the manipulations they perform inside the browser. Section 5 presents the results of our experiments, and Section 6 discusses the limitations of our approach, provides a summary, and outlines future work.

## 2. Related Work
Major banking trojans operate within the browser to intercept and manipulate network data, a technique known as man-in-the-browser (MITB). These trojans often employ user-mode rootkit techniques to access unencrypted network data. Below, we provide an overview of related work on rootkits and different approaches to detect them, showing that we can determine the banking trojan family with high probability, closely related to malware classification.

Rootkits and manipulation components can be applied at different levels: user-mode, kernel-mode, virtualized, and firmware. User-mode and kernel-mode rootkits are more common, with user-mode being essential for banking trojans due to the need to access unencrypted data. Rootkits typically hook relevant functions inside the victim program, such as the network receive functions in a browser, redirecting control flow to intermediate filter functions. Various libraries enable this manipulation [15, 17, 21, 16].

Rootkit detection often involves sanity checks for inconsistent relationships and data structures. Techniques include dynamic tracing to identify control flow redirections [37] and integrity checking frameworks for known code and data regions [10, 32]. Academic work includes dynamic slicing on sensitive data [20], differential execution tracing with virtual machines [30, 31], and introspection techniques [13, 33, 24, 35]. Kernel structures that may be used to add hidden functionality are also identified and monitored [38].

Inline function hooking in user-mode applications has been studied [25, 27, 26], but these approaches often result in false positives due to legitimate system modifications. Our approach, Banksafe, overcomes this problem by monitoring only specific applications, such as the web browser, significantly reducing the likelihood of false positives.

Other related work focuses on the general classification of malware. Antivirus software is not always reliable for classification [8], as vendors prioritize detection over accurate naming. Behavioral information and clustering algorithms can provide more reliable classification [7, 29, 36, 39, 22].

## 3. Overview of Banking Trojans
The most successful banking trojan in recent years is Zeus, also known as Zbot. Its success stems from its technical sophistication and the decision of its author to sell ready-to-use packages to criminals in underground forums. These packages include a builder and PHP files for setting up a command & control server. The Zeus builder generates new variants using custom binary obfuscation techniques to evade detection. Older versions were limited to infecting Windows XP, while newer variants target Windows Vista and 7.
