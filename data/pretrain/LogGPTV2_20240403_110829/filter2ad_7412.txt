## Abstract
Online social networks (OSNs) are a vital source of information for researchers in various fields, including computer science, sociology, and economics. However, the sheer size of these networks, such as Facebook with 1.28 billion active users in March 2014 and Twitter with 255 million active users in April 2014, makes them challenging to study. Additionally, companies implement measures to prevent data crawling and limit data sharing with the research community. Therefore, sampling techniques are becoming increasingly important for studying OSNs.

In this work, we experimentally evaluate well-known sampling techniques on a full social graph of Twitter crawled in 2012. Our contribution is to assess the behavior of these techniques on a real directed graph, considering two scenarios: (a) identifying the most popular users and (b) obtaining an unbiased sample of users. We aim to identify the most suitable sampling techniques for each scenario.

## 1. Introduction
The number of users on OSNs is continually increasing, making it more challenging to study these networks as the data grows larger. Companies also take measures to prevent data crawling, such as Twitter discontinuing API 1.0, which supported anonymous requests, and requiring user authentication for each request in the new API 1.1. This makes data collection more difficult and time-consuming.

Additionally, the Twitter social graph is unique because it is directed, unlike classical social networks like Facebook. On Twitter, users can follow others to subscribe to their tweets without needing confirmation from the followed user. Directed graphs are more complex to study than undirected ones.

In 2012, we collected the full graph of Twitter, resulting in a graph with 505 million nodes and 23 billion arcs. We use this graph to evaluate how classical sampling techniques perform with a limited sampling budget, defined as a limited number of nodes that can be sampled.

Our findings show that classical sampling techniques have a significant bias toward high-degree nodes. These techniques can be used to identify such nodes but are not suitable for performing a uniform sample of the directed social graph. We describe the techniques in Section 2 and present the results of applying these techniques to our dataset in Section 3.

## 2. Sampling Techniques
For our experimental study, we considered two classical sampling techniques. The directed nature of the Twitter social graph allows each technique to traverse the graph in three different directions: (a) in the direction of followers, (b) in the direction of followings, and (c) bidirectionally (treating arcs as edges).

### Breadth-First Search (BFS)
BFS is a natural way to sample social networks due to the design of their APIs, which provide access to the list of friends, followers, or followings of a particular user. For example, Kwak et al. [3] used BFS with Perez Hilton as a seed to crawl the Twitter social graph in 2009. However, when the number of API requests is limited, BFS can result in a biased sample.

### Random Walk (RW)
RW involves traversing the graph by randomly selecting a neighbor. RW is known to visit nodes with a probability proportional to their degree. While there is extensive literature on RW for undirected graphs, there is less for directed ones.

### Unbiased Sampling Method for Directed Social Graphs (USDSG)
Proposed by Wang et al. [4], USDSG is a modified random walk that discards a random jump to a node with a probability proportional to the node's degree. The directed graph is treated as undirected, with each arc replaced by an edge.

## 3. Results
We performed our experiments on the full Twitter social graph collected in 2012, consisting of 505 million accounts interconnected by 23 billion links. We used 100 random seeds and performed each traversal 100 times, stopping when 10% of the graph (50.5 million nodes) was sampled.

### 3.1 Popular Users
To evaluate the ability of the techniques to sample popular users, we examined the TOP 1000 most followed users in the sample (Figure 1). RW performed the best, requiring only 342,000 nodes to obtain all TOP 1000 most followed users. This is due to RW's bias toward high-degree nodes. BFS, in all three directions, showed high variance depending on the seed's position. Interestingly, BFS in the direction of followings outperformed RW when the budget was less than 2,000, as some Twitter users follow several popular accounts.

### 3.2 Unbiased Sample
To assess the quality of the distribution, we introduced a metric called the sampling ratio. We distributed users into logarithmic bins based on the number of followers/followings they have. The sampling ratio for each bin is the ratio of the number of sampled users in the bin to the total number of users in the bin. For the ground truth, we used a 10% uniform random sample of Twitter users (UNI on Figure 2).

Figure 2 shows the results for bidirectional versions of the traversals. All techniques, including USDSG, exhibited a high bias toward high-degree nodes. BFS in the direction of followers and followings was not presented due to some seeds having no followers or followings, leading to empty samples.

While querying the social network for randomly generated IDs (as shown for UNI in Figure 2) may seem like the best way to obtain a uniform unbiased sample, it is not always feasible. For example, Facebook assigns IDs sparsely, and only 75% of account IDs in Twitter within the range [0, 8 × 10^8) correspond to valid accounts. Companies may also restrict access to user IDs to protect privacy.

## 4. Conclusion
We applied classical sampling techniques to the largest Twitter dataset ever collected. Our results show that all classical sampling techniques introduce a bias toward high-degree nodes, which can significantly alter the outcomes of studies relying on partial crawls of the social graph. This highlights the need for further research to develop unbiased techniques for sampling directed OSNs.

On the other hand, the bias of these techniques toward high-degree nodes provides a simple method for crawling popular users in the OSN. More information about our study of Twitter can be found on our project page [1].
