Abstract. The Internet and the Web have extended traditional business net-
works by allowing a Web of different digital resources to work together to cre-
ate value for organizations. The most industrialized countries have entered a
post-industrial era where their prosperity is largely created through a service
economy. There is a clear transition from a manufacturing based economy to a
service based economy. From the technological perspective, the development of
Web-based infrastructures to support and deliver services in this new economy
raises a number of challenges. From a business perspective, there is the need to
understand how value is created through services. In this paper, we describe
how we propose to address these two perspectives and realize the vision of the
Internet of Services (IoS), where Web-based IT-supported service ecosystems
form the base of service business value networks. This paper addresses the main
challenging issues that need to be explored to provide an integrated technical
and business infrastructure for the Internet of Service.
Keywords: Internet of Services, service engineering, service, e-service, web

1 Introduction
Throughout the years organizations have always tried to introduce new business mod-
els to gain a competitive advantage over competitors or to explore hidden markets.
For example, IKEA introduced the concept that people could transport the merchan-
dise and assemble the furniture by themselves. eBay gained an early competitive
advantage by being the first-to-market with a new business model based on auctions.
Dell was able to bypass distributors, resellers, and retailers and use the Internet to
reduce costs. In all these examples, the new or adapted business models are often
derived from the human perception that something could be done in a different way.
The idea comes very often from intuition and it is driven by a business need.
Recently, the vision of the Internet of Services (IoS) [13] emerged and can be seen
as a new business model that can radically change the way we discover and invoke
services. The IoS describes an infrastructure that uses the Internet as a medium for
offering and selling services. As a result, services become tradable goods. Service
marketplaces, where service consumers and providers are brought together to trade
services and so engage in business interaction, are an enabling technology for the IoS
vision. Thus, the IoS provides the business and technical base for advanced business
models where service providers and consumers form business networks for service

provision and consumption. Within these business networks, organizations work to-
gether to deliver a service to consumers. For example, a service-based value network
may include the research, development, design, production, marketing, sales and
distribution of a particular service. All these phases work interchangeably to add to
the overall worth of a service. Value is created from the relationship between the
company, its customers, intermediaries, aggregators and suppliers.
In the Internet of Services, the underlying IT perspective provides a global descrip-
tion of standards, tools, applications, and architectures available to support the busi-
ness perspective. Currently, the service-oriented architecture paradigm has gained
mainstream acceptance as a strategy for consolidating and repurposing applications to
be combined with new applications in more dynamic environments through configur-
able services. Services that are composed into advanced business processes can inter-
operate with other services in order to support business processes spanning across
organizational boundaries. In this paper we describe the challenges to support the
concept of the Internet of Services. We enumerate the areas that need to be explored
to provide fundamental insights on research to enable a radically new way to trade
services on the Internet. A special focus will be laid on service marketplaces as an
enabling technology for the IoS and to service engineering, which we see as a funda-
mental approach for creating services.
The remaining of this paper is structured in four main sections. In Section 2 we de-
scribe the role of marketplaces and clarify the concept of service for the IoS. Section 3
identifies a set of requirements that needs to be addressed to support the concept of IoS
to provide, create and drive a new “service industry” for producing, changing, adapt-
ing, (re)selling, and operating services in a Web-based business service economy. In
Section 4, we discuss the importance of Service Engineering (SE) for the IoS. SE is a
new discipline that will enable the development and implementation of technological
solutions based on the Internet of Services. Finally, Section 5 presents our conclusions.
2 Marketplaces for the Internet of Services
Electronic marketplaces for products have gained much attention over the last years
enabling business interaction between providers and consumers of physical goods.
Examples of such marketplaces include eBay and Amazon. In the IoS vision, services
are seen as tradable goods that can be offered on service marketplaces by their
providers to make them available for potential consumers. [2] describe service mar-
ketplaces as one example of web service ecosystems which represent “… a logical
collection of web services whose exposure and access are subject to constraints,
which are characteristic of business service delivery.” On a service marketplace mul-
tiple providers may offer their services. Providers may be large providers as well as
small companies offering specialized services. As such, an ecosystem of competing as
well as collaborating services may be created.
2.1 What Are Services?
The terms Service, e-Service and Web Service have been widely used to refer, some-
times, to the same concept and other times to different concepts. These terms are
generally used to identify an autonomous software component that is uniquely identi-
fied by a URI and that can be accessed using standard Internet protocols such as
Service Engineering for the Internet of Services 17
XML, SOAP, or HTTP. [1] have identified that the terms Service, e-Service and Web
Service actually address related concepts from different domains such as computer
science, information science and business science. We believe that a deeper under-
standing of those concepts needs to be made in order to conceptually separate and
address the various stakeholders involved when architecting an enterprise wide solu-
tion based on services. Therefore, we introduce a set of definitions for the IoS.
Business Service. In business and economics, a service is the non-material equivalent
of a good. In these domains, a service is considered to be an activity which is intangible
by nature. Services are offered by a provider to its consumers. We adopt the definition
from [1] who defined business services as business activities provided by a service
provider to a service consumer to create a value for the consumer. This definition is
consistent as it is also understood in the business research community. In traditional
economies, business services are typically discovered and invoked manually, but their
realization maybe performed by automated or manual means (Figure 1). Therefore,
business services may be performed by humans. Examples include cutting hair, paint-
ing a house, typing a letter, or filling a form. If a service is executed by means of auto-
mated mechanisms then processing an insurance claim is also considered a service.
Services are considerably different from products primarily due to their intangible na-
ture. Most products can be described physically based on observable properties, such as
size, color, and weight. On the other hand, services lack of concrete characteristics.
Thus, services must be defined indirectly in terms of the effects they have on consum-
ers. Products have usually a well defined set of possible variants for customization. For
example, if a consumer requires a faster laptop, a more powerful CPU can be designed,
built and attached to the motherboard. If an important consumer (e.g. Yellow Cab Co.)
desires yellow cars, a manufacturer only needs to notify the production chain to select a
new color. The same cannot be easily achieved for services. This makes the description
of services one of the most important undertakings for the IoS.
e-Service. With the advances made by the Internet, companies started to use elec-
tronic information technologies for supplying services that were to some extend proc-
essed with the mean of automated applications. At this stage, the concept of e-service
[12], electronic- or e-commerce was introduced to describe transactions conducted

over the Internet. The main technology that made e-commerce a reality was computer
networks. Initial developments included on-line transactions of buying and selling
where business was done via Electronic Data Interchange (EDI). Examples of such
transactions include an EDI request for bank transfer (Figure 1) or a money transfer
via a private network. While many definitions for e-services can be found in the lit-
erature, we will use the definition given by [6] since it adequately matches our service
concept: “a e-service is a collection of network-resident software services accessible
via standardized protocols, whose functionality can be automatically discovered and
integrated into applications or composed to form more complex services.” Therefore,
we consider that e-services are a subset of business services (Figure 1). E-services are
services for which the Internet (or any other equivalent network such as mobile and
interactive TV platforms) is used as a channel to interact with consumers. Virtually
any service can be transformed into an e-service if it can be invoked via a data net-
work. It should be pointed out that this definition implies that the ability to withdraw
money from an ATM machine is supplied trough an e-service. E-services are inde-
pendent of the specification language used to define its functionality, non-functional
properties or interface. The term Internet Services will be used be used to refer to the
discovery and invocation of e-services using the Internet as a channel. In this paper,
when no ambiguity arise, we will use the term service to refer to an Internet service.
Web Service. Web services are e-services that are made available for consumers using
Web-based protocols or Web-based programs. Separating the logical and technical
layers specifications of a service leaves open the possibility for alternative concrete
technologies for e-services. Nowadays, we can identify three types of Web services:
RPC Web Services, SOA Web Services, and RESTful Web services. RPC Web Services
bring distributed programming functions and methods from the RPC world. Some re-
searchers view RPC Web services as a reincarnation of CORBA into Web services.
SOA Web Services implement an architecture according to SOA, where the basic unit of
communication is a message, rather than an operation. This is often referred to as “mes-
sage-oriented” services. Unlike RPC Web services, loose coupling is achieved more
easily since the focus is on the “contract” that WSDL provides, rather than the underly-
ing implementation details. RESTful Web Services are based on HTTP and use a set of
well-known operations, such as GET, PUT, and DELETE. The main focus is on inter-
acting with stateful resources, rather than messages or operations (as it is with WSDL
and SOAP). [4] describes REST objectives in the following way: “The name ‘Represen-
tational State Transfer’ (REST) is intended to evoke an image of how a well-designed
Web application behaves: a network of web pages (a virtual state-machine), where the
user progresses through an application by selecting links (state transitions), resulting in
the next page (representing the next state of the application) being transferred to the user
and rendered for their use.” We also consider that any e-service that can be invoked
using Web standards, such as HTTP, is also a Web service.
2.2 Discovery, Invocation and/or Execution of Services
The lifecycle of services includes two main phases that are of importance to the IoS
(Figure 1): discovery/invocation and execution. Discovery and invocation refer to the
medium and technology used to find and request for the execution of a particular service
(human-based, via EDI, Web-based, etc.). The execution describes how the realization
Service Engineering for the Internet of Services 19
of a service is carried out. A service maybe carried out only with human involvement,
with a conjunction of humans and automated devices, or resorting purely on automated
machines (Figure 2). Therefore, services in the vision of the IoS may lay anywhere in
the spectrum of services executed by humans, on the one side, or purely automated
services on the other side. Nonetheless, in the IoS, the discovery and invocation of all
services is IT-based. Service marketplaces provide the access point to the services made
available by their providers. One example of a service where invocation is IT-based but
execution is performed by humans would be a house painting service where a consumer
selects the painter (service provider) and the color of the house using a service market-
place. The painting of the house is, of course, done by humans.
