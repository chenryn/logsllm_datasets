ABSTRACT
Recommender systems typically require users’ history data
to provide a list of recommendations and such recommen-
dations usually reside on the cloud/server. However, the
release of such private data to the cloud has been shown to
put users at risk. It is highly desirable to provide users high-
quality personalized services while respecting their privacy.
In this paper, we develop the ﬁrst Enhanced Privacy-built-
In Client for Personalized Recommendation (EpicRec) sys-
tem that performs the data perturbation on the client side
to protect users’ privacy. Our system needs no assumption
of trusted server and no change on the recommendation al-
gorithms on the server side; and needs minimum user inter-
action in their preferred manner, which makes our solution
ﬁt very well into real world practical use.
The design of EpicRec system incorporates three main
modules: (1) usable privacy control interface that enables
two user preferred privacy controls, overall and category-
based controls, in the way they understand; (2) user privacy
level quantiﬁcation that automatically quantiﬁes user pri-
vacy concern level from these user understandable inputs;
(3) lightweight data perturbation algorithm that perturbs
user private data with provable guarantees on both diﬀeren-
tial privacy and data utility.
Using large-scale real world datasets, we show that, for
both overall and category-based privacy controls, EpicRec
performs best with respect to both perturbation quality and
personalized recommendation, with negligible computational
overhead. Therefore, EpicRec enables two contradictory
goals, privacy preservation and recommendation accuracy.
We also implement a proof-of-concept EpicRec system to
demonstrate a privacy-preserving personal computer for movie
recommendation with web-based privacy controls. We be-
lieve EpicRec is an important step towards designing a prac-
tical system that enables companies to monetize on user data
using high quality personalized services with strong provable
privacy protection to gain user acceptance and adoption of
their services.

INTRODUCTION
The last few decades have witnessed wide applications
of recommender systems to provide personalized service to
users, such as intelligent personal assistant and smart TV
or other content recommendations. In fact, such personal-
ized services become key business drivers for many compa-
nies. As one can understand, personalized service is based
on user’s data and oftentimes requires substantial user data
in order to provide high-quality recommendation services.
However, many user concerns about recommender systems
have been raised from privacy perspectives due to the release
of users’ private data. Consumer fears over privacy continue
to escalate. Based on Pew Research, 68% consumers think
that current laws are insuﬃcient to protect their privacy
and demand tighter privacy laws; and 86% of Internet users
have taken proactive steps to remove or mask their digital
footprints. Responding to increasing user privacy concerns,
governments in US/EU are increasing and enforcing existing
regulations. LG TV, as another example, was caught in
lawsuit on illegally obtaining users’ private data.
To resolve the tensions between business intelligence and
user privacy, it is critically desirable to develop technologies
that can preserve and control user data privacy and in the
meanwhile still allow intelligence and personalization busi-
ness. Without such technology enabler, future users will
stop using services and companies will not be able to deploy
services due to privacy law constraints and user concerns.
A majority of existing methods [5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 19] are
developed based on the scenarios that recommender servers
are trusted such as the Netﬂix movie recommendation sys-
tem. One main reason for such assumption is that classic
recommender system algorithms, such as Collaborative Fil-
tering [25], require multiple users’ data in order to perform
personalized recommendation. It is easy to understand that
a trusted server collects all users’ data and can therefore per-
form such personalized recommendation. The most relevant
privacy preserving approach is proposed by McSherry et al.
[19], in which the server does the anonymization on user pri-
vate data in which random noises are added into each step
of aggregates in recommendation algorithm. All these meth-
ods attempted to protect user privacy when server releasing
user data to third party applications and business partners.
Unfortunately, in such device-cloud based recommender
systems, there are many other privacy attacks (as shown in
180Figure 1: Attacking Model
Figure 2: EpicRec System under Untrusted Server
Figure 1) that cannot be modeled and addressed in such a
trusted server setting and require other types of protections.
For example, when user data travels from device to cloud, at-
tackers can eavesdrop the transmission channel and launch
a “man-in-the-middle attack”, therefore data may need to
be encrypted during transmission. Malicious attackers can
break into the cloud/server and steal user data. This de-
mands many security measures to take to protect data on
the cloud, such as encrypting data in storage. Moreover,
server insiders may also leak user data to other parties.
As such, in this paper, we design a novel and practical
privacy-built-in client under untrusted server settings,
in
which user data is perturbed and anonymized on their pri-
vate devices before leaving their devices and users are given
more peace of mind. As one can understand, data pertur-
bation on device side under untrusted server settings poses
extra challenges than that under trusted server settings be-
cause data perturbation has to be done without knowing
other users’ data.
There are some existing approaches developed under such
untrusted server settings, including cryptography techniques
[3, 21], diﬀerential privacy-based techniques [24], and ran-
domization techniques [23]. Unfortunately, these approaches
cannot be applied in practice due to various reasons such as
computation cost, the need of an impractical trusted third
party, lack of usability and so on.
In this paper, we propose the ﬁrst practical Enhanced
Privacy-built-In Client for Personalized Recommendation (Epi-
cRec) system. As one can see in Figure 2, EpicRec, residing
on the user’s hub device (e.g., personal laptop, smartphone,
etc.), collects user private data from a variety of user’s de-
vices and perturbs the private data based on user’s privacy
concerns. More importantly, the existence of EpicRec on
user’s device not only satisﬁes users’ privacy needs but also
requires no assumption of trusted server and no changes of
recommendation algorithms, rendering EpicRec very prac-
tical. Our contributions are summarized as follows:
• We design the ﬁrst privacy-preserving EpicRec frame-
work on user client for personalized recommendation.
EpicRec collects user private data from various de-
vices, provides usable privacy control interfaces, quan-
tiﬁes user privacy control input and uses it to perturb
user data. EpicRec enables user preferred overall pri-
vacy control (S-EpicRec) and category-based privacy
control (M-EpicRec) to satisfy users’ diﬀerent needs;
and in the meanwhile maintains low user cognitive load
by minimizing the needs of user interactions.
• We design S-EpicRec and M-EpicRec systems respec-
tively, both based on the state-of-the-art diﬀerential
privacy and utility notions. We quantify the user pri-
vacy level by optimizing the utility based on the under-
lying data properties; and develop a light-weight and
data perturbation algorithm to preserve the category
aggregates with both privacy and utility theoretical
guarantees, which signiﬁcantly improves the existing
approach [24] from both privacy and utility aspects.
• We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the per-
formance of EpicRec on large-scale real-world datasets.
The results show that, from both privacy and utility
perspectives, our proposed S-EpicRec and M-EpicRec
systems consistently outperform other (pseudo) com-
petitors that apply existing methods into some com-
ponents of our EpicRec system. In addition, our ap-
proach takes less than 1.5 seconds on personal com-
puters.
• We implement a proof-of-concept EpicRec system for
personalized movie recommendation with web-based
overall and category-based privacy concern controls.
The rest of paper is organized as follows. Section 2 dis-
cusses the related work. The background and architecture
design of EpicRec system are presented in Section 3. Sec-
tion 4 and 5 propose detailed design of S-EpicRec and M-
EpicRec systems supporting diﬀerent granularities of pri-
vacy controls. The experimental results and implementa-
tion of proof-of-concept system are presented in Section 6
and Section 7 respectively. Section 8 concludes the whole
paper and discusses some future work.
2. RELATED WORK
Privacy-preserving Recommendation. Table 1 shows
the comparison between our EpicRec system and existing
approaches for personalized recommendation under untrusted
server settings. The earliest work by Polat et al. [23] devel-
oped randomized mechanisms to perturb user private data
before releasing to recommender systems. However, their
method does not have provable privacy guarantees and was
later identiﬁed that using clustering method on their per-
turbed data can still accurately infer users’ original raw data
with accuracy up to more than 70% [30] and make the pri-
vacy protection useless.
In the meanwhile, cryptography-
based approaches [21, 3] are proposed with privacy guar-
antees. However, these approaches require a trusted third-
party (Cryptographic Service Provider (CSP)) and expen-
sive private computation. Another class of orthogonal ap-
proaches [24] are based on the state-of-the-art diﬀerential
privacy notion, with both privacy and utility guarantees.
Unfortunately, in addition to the above limitations, all ex-
isting approaches largely ignore the usable privacy control

such that users cannot provide their privacy concerns in a
way they understand.
In addition, there are some other privacy-preserving rec-
ommendation approaches under trusted server settings [19]
or some particular recommendation services [17]. Moreover,
system developers, and policy makers recently have been
coming up with solutions at diﬀerent levels [13, 29].
Our proposed EpicRec system provides a comprehensive
solution at all levels, towards a practical and usable privacy-
preserving client for untrusted recommender system, with
strong privacy and utility guarantees.
Diﬀerential Privacy. Diﬀerential privacy [7, 8] has be-
come the de facto standard for privacy preserving data an-
alytics. Dwork et al. [8] established the guideline to guar-
antee diﬀerential privacy for individual aggregate queries by
calibrating the Laplace noise to each query based on the
global sensitivity. Various works have adopted this deﬁnition
for publishing histograms [28], search logs [15], mining data
streams [4], and record linkage [1]. Later on, a probabilis-
tic relaxation was proposed by Machanavajjhala et al. [18],
called probabilistic diﬀerential privacy. This novel diﬀeren-
tial privacy notion allows the privacy preservation with high
probability, thereby improve the ﬂexibility of global sensi-
tivity analysis. An alternative approach for noise mitigation
was instance-based noise injection approaches by Nissim et
al. [22]. This paper ﬁrst introduced local sensitivity and its
upper bound smooth sensitivity, which allows the injection
of Admissible noise to ensure diﬀerential privacy. Unfortu-
nately, all these approaches require the strict satisfaction of
perturbed aggregates in the sanitized data and restrict their
applications to only statistical data publishing. A recent
work [24] was proposed to address the above constraints, by
perturbing data to guarantee both diﬀerential privacy and
recommendation quality. Our data perturbation module in
