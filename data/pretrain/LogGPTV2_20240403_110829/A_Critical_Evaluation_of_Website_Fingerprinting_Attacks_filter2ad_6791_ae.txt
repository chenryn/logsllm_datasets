We studied a number of variables in isolation includ-
ing website variance over time, multitab browsing behav-
ior, TBB version, Internet connection, and the open world.
When each of these assumptions are violated, the accuracy
of the system drops signiﬁcantly, and we have not exam-
ined in depth how the accuracy is impacted when multiple
assumptions are violated.
Our results showed that success of a WF adversary de-
pends on many factors such as temporal proximity of the
training and testing traces, TBB versions used for training
and testing, and users’ browsing habits, which are commonly
oversimpliﬁed in the WF models. Therefore, for most cases
it seems that the non-targeted attack is not feasible given
the sophistication level of current attacks.
There may be some exceptions in the case where a site of
interest, perhaps a whistleblowing site, is particularly unique
in its features and stable over time. Even the case of target-
ing a user is non-trivial, as these aspects of their behavior
must be observed a priori or guessed correctly for WF to
be a signiﬁcant threat. Some users’ behavior may be more
susceptible to these attacks than others. In that case, the
adversary could also have enough background knowledge to
mount a more targeted attack and reduce the false positive
rate that we demonstrated empirically to be critical for the
success of the WF adversary.
We believe that further research on evaluating the com-
mon assumptions of the WF literature is important for as-
sessing the practicality and the eﬃcacy of the WF attacks.
Future work in developing WF attacks against Tor should
also evaluate their proposed attacks in practical scenarios, so
that the Tor stakeholders and the research community have
a more realistic assessment of the threat they are facing.
