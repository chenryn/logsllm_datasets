User: I am using the universal feed parser library in python to get an atom feed. This atom feed has been generated using google reader after bundling several subscriptions. 
I am able to receive the latest feeds, however the feedparser.parse(url) returns a FeedParserDict which doesnot have the etag or modified values. I unable to just check for the latest feeds because of this. 
Does google reader send an etag value? if yes why isn't the feedparser returning it?

Assistant: The Google Reader API does not support ETags or If-Modified-Since. However, it does support an ot=<timestamp in seconds since the epoch> parameter which you can use to restrict fetched data to items since you last attempted a fetch.
