User: I am running development web server in Google App Engine Launcher without any troubles. 
But I can't successfully stop it. When I am press Stop button, nothing happens. 
Nothing adds in logs after pressing Stop.
And after that I can't close launcher. 
The only way to close launcher is Task Manager.
Although when I am using dev_appserver.py myapp via cmd it is successfully stopped by Ctrl+C.
By the way I am under proxy.
Assistant: I think your server is crashed because maybe you overloaded it or maybe there's an internal error that can be solved by re-installing the web-server.
