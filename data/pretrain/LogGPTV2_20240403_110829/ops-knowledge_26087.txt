I am currently running a development web server using the Google App Engine Launcher without any issues. However, I am unable to stop it successfully. When I press the "Stop" button, nothing happens, and there are no additional log entries. Additionally, I cannot close the launcher normally; the only way to close it is through the Task Manager.

Interestingly, when I run `dev_appserver.py myapp` via the command line, I can stop the server successfully with `Ctrl+C`.

For your information, I am working behind a proxy.

**Response:**

It sounds like you are encountering an issue with the Google App Engine Launcher that prevents you from stopping the development server properly. Here are a few steps you can try to resolve the problem:

1. **Check for Updates:** Ensure that you are using the latest version of the Google App Engine SDK and Launcher. Sometimes, bugs are fixed in newer releases.

2. **Proxy Configuration:** Since you mentioned that you are behind a proxy, ensure that the proxy settings are correctly configured in the Google App Engine Launcher. Misconfigured proxy settings can sometimes cause unexpected behavior.

3. **Logs and Error Messages:** Even though no new log entries appear after pressing the "Stop" button, check the existing logs for any error messages or warnings that might provide more context about what is going wrong.

4. **Reinstallation:** If the issue persists, consider uninstalling and then reinstalling the Google App Engine SDK and Launcher. This can help resolve any internal errors or corrupted files.

5. **Alternative Method:** As a workaround, you can continue to use the `dev_appserver.py` command-line tool, which seems to work correctly for you. You can start and stop the server using `Ctrl+C` as needed.

If none of these steps resolve the issue, you may want to report the problem to the Google App Engine support forum or community, providing detailed information about your setup and the steps you have already taken.
