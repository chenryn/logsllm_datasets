technology-neutrality, 
When  admitting  electronic  media  as  a  means  for  citizens 
to  approach  public  authorities  –  i.e.,  when  advancing 
official  proceedings  towards  e-Government  –  security  is 
an  indispensable  precondition  for  concerns  of  legal 
certainty  and  for  achieving  acceptance  by  the  citizens. 
While  the  security-enabling  technologies  such  as  smart-
cards, digital signatures, and PKI are mature, questions of 
scalability, 
forward-
compatibility  arise  when  being  deployed  on  the  large 
scale, such as when being deployed nation-wide. 
In  this  paper  the  security  architecture  followed  with  the 
Austrian citizen card is presented. This dedicated concept 
where  smart-cards  are  going  to  be  rolled  out  to  every 
Austrian  citizen  will  establish  the  citizen’s  security 
infrastructure 
e-Government 
applications.  We  briefly  present  the  legal  provisions  that 
enable e-Government. We than reflect on requirements to 
be  fulfilled  to  achieve  a  lasting  security  architecture that 
provides swift deployment of applications, but provides the 
flexibility  to  not  discriminate  against  service  providers 
and  technologies  that  will  emerge  in  future.  The  concept 
called “security layer” is discussed as the core part of the 
security architecture, which basically is an open interface 
that hides the security-relevant functionality of the citizen 
card  on  a  high  abstraction  level.  A  few  e-Government 
applications that are being launched in the short-term are 
sketched  to  give  a  touch  of  the  variety  of  requirements 
covered in the architecture.

e-Government  – 
interaction  between 
state 
authorities  and  society  with  help  of  information  and 
communication  technology  (ICT)  –  promises  to  improve 
the  services  for  the  citizen  and  at  the  same  time 
tremendously reduces retention periods and costs such as 
by  avoiding  costly  media 
transitions.  Consider  for 
instance the workflow of a tax form downloaded from the 
Internet,  filled  out  at  a  personal  computer  (PC),  printed 
out,  signed  and  mailed  by  the  individual,  and  finally  re-
converted to its electronic representation at the tax office. 
Compare  that  to  simply entering the data to a Web form 
offered by the treasury.  
Besides  the  work  flow  considerations,  the  tax  form 
example  already  shows that security needs to be a major 
concern  in  order  to  avoid  improper  use,  together  with 
requiring  a  high-level  security  architecture  applicable  to 
the  dissimilar  proceedings.  The  individual  needs  to  be 
identified  and  the  filled  tax  form  needs  to  be  authentic. 
While the combination of a tax number or a social security 
number, together with a digital signature based on a public 
key  infrastructure  (PKI)  e.g.  provided  by  the  treasury 
itself may serve that certain case, other departments may 
have  different  requirements.  The  variety  of  public 
proceedings asks for a sweeping security architecture that 
scales in two dimensions – the number of applications and 
the  number  of  individuals  that  utilize  e-Government.  In 
addition, as the installation of e-Government is considered 
a 
future 
technologies needs to be considered in early design stages, 
as otherwise tailing applications for each new technology, 
as  such  technologies  mature,  may  turn  out  a  quite  costly 
experience.

citizens.  This  trend-setting  decision  will  finally  result  in 
delivering  an  “e-Government-enabling”  smart-card  to

In  this  paper  we  discuss  how  these  leading  decisions 
have  been  implemented  security-wise.  A  previous  white 
paper discusses the security requirements of the so-called 
citizen card concept from a public authority’s perspective 
[1].  We present a security architecture that addresses the 
requirements laid down in the paper in a scalable way as 
well as is open for the market in terms of easy inclusion of 
specific security solutions and emerging technologies.  
In  the  remainder  of  the  paper  we  discuss  the  security 
requirements  that  arise  in e-Government environments in 
section 2.  These  are  mainly  identification  and  entity 
authentication,  electronic  signatures  for  data  origin 
authentication,  and  confidentiality  and  data  protection 
aspects.  In  section 3  the  legal  provisions  that  enable 
e-Government are sketched. These are the signature laws 
and  rules  regarding  admissibility  of  electronic  means  of 
identification  and  delivery.  The  Austrian  citizen  card 
concept is introduced in section 4, where we describe how 
the  security  requirements  and 
legal  provisions  are 
translated  into  a  state-of-the-art  technology.  In  section 5 
the so-called  ‘Security Capsule’ and ‘Security Layer’ are 
presented  which  are  the  core  part  of  the  security

To  give  an  outlook  to  the  Austrian  e-Government 
initiatives that will make use of this security architecture, 
section 6 describes a few e-Government applications that 
will be deployed shortly and that will utilize the concepts 
introduced in this paper. Finally, conclusions are drawn.  
2. Requirements in e-Government  
In  a  first  rapprochement  the  security  requirements 
arising in e-Government are: 
•  corroboration that the entity is the one claimed – entity 
authentication 
•  corroboration that the source of information is the one 
claimed – data origin authentication 
•  provision  that  the  information  is  not  disclosed  to 
unauthorized entities – confidentiality 
•  provision  against  false  denial  of  having  carried  out  a 
transaction – non-repudiation 
In official proceedings even a single case of abuse may 
carry  high  severity  and  may  jeopardize  civil  rights.  The 
consequence  of  such  strict  security  constraints  is  that 
state-of-the-art  technology  needs  to  be  used  and  that  the 
security measures of the systems need to be proven.

that  no

such  as  citizen  smart-cards  or  portals  to  access  services 
shall  be  open  for  the  market.  An  intention  is  also  to 
exploit  synergies  by  aiming  for  an  architecture  where 
infrastructure deployed by the public authorities can also 
be  used  to  improve  the  security  of  e-Commerce.  In 
addition,  e-Government  may  open  business  opportunities 
where  in  a  public-private  partnership  civil  services  can 
focus  on 
responsibilities  where  official 
competence  is  involved,  while  private  business  can  offer 
value added services such as Web portals.

it is of vital importance that the authority has full control

proprietary  solutions.  Therefore  the  interfaces  have  been

and the non-repudiation property.  
The  equivalences  in  electronic  processes  are  well 
known:  encryption,  digital signatures and PKI. However, 
let us reflect a bit on the PKI case. By issuing a certificate 
a certification service provider (CSP) establishes the link 
between the physical identity and the virtual identity. The 
physical  identity  may  for  instance  be  indicated  as  the 
individual’s name in the certificate and the virtual identity 
is usually a public key. However, even if the registration 
procedure  includes  personal  appearance  of  the  user  and 
even  if  the  identity  link  is  established  by  showing  an 
identity card during registration, the information provided 
with  the  certificate  still  is  limited  to  data  given  in  the 
certificate – the individual’s name in our example. Official 
proceedings  usually  require  to  unequivocally  identifying 
the individual. Even in a relatively small country such as 
Austria  with  eight  million  residents,  and  even  if  also 
giving  the  birth  date  –  i.e.  giving  the  first  name,  the last 
name  and  the  date  and  year  of  birth  to  identify  the 
individual,  there  are  several  hundreds  of  duplicates.  To 
unequivocally establish the identity online, the CSP needs 
to give online access to the registration records, additional 
information such as a link to public registration records is 
needed,  or  the  public  authorities  need  to  provide  CSP 
services for its own.  
Basing  on  the  political  decision  of  employing  smart-
cards  as  the  security  infrastructure  of  e-Government 
processes  in  Austria  the  procedure  followed  was  to  first 
define  the  general  requirements  arising  from  the  public 
authority’s  perspective  in  a  guiding  document  [1].  The 
further  proceeding  has  been  based  on  this  consolidated 
view and is discussed in the remainder of this paper.  
3. Legal provisions vs. technical concepts 
Security-wise,  public  proceedings  are  in  particular 
characterized  by  requirements  of  writing,  handwritten 
signatures for authentication, as a declaration of will, or as 
a declaration of knowledge. Furthermore, requirements of 
identifying  the  individual  and  the  delivery  of  decrees  or 
notifications are evident. In the following sub-sections we 
discuss  the  legal  provisions  that  enable  modeling  these 
requirements  by  electronic  processes  in  an  online  world 
and compare the legal provisions to technical concepts.  
3.1 Electronic signatures 
Signature  laws  provide  rules  on  the  permissibility  of 
electronic 
signatures  as  evidence.  Usually  digital 
signatures based an asymmetric cryptography are used. Its 
equivalence to handwritten signatures is a major aspect of 
signature  laws.  For  the  European  Union  (EU),  the 
electronic  signature  directive  [2]  defines  in its article 5.1 
if  certain 
needs 
certificates 
that  electronic  signatures  create  the  same  legal  effect  as 
handwritten  signatures, 
requirements  are 
fulfilled.  Such  electronic  signatures  are  commonly 
referred to as qualified signatures1. The requirements for a 
qualified signature are basically that: 
•  the qualified signature is created by a so-called secure 
signature-creation  device  (SSCD).  The  SSCD  is  the 
device getting in touch with the signer’s private key – 
called signature-creation data (SCD) in the directive.
