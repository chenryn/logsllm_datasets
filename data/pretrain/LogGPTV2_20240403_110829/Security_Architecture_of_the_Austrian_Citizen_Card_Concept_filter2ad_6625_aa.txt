## Abstract
The adoption of electronic media as a means for citizens to interact with public authorities—advancing official proceedings towards e-Government—requires robust security measures to ensure legal certainty and public acceptance. While technologies such as smart cards, digital signatures, and PKI are well-established, challenges related to scalability and forward-compatibility arise when deploying these on a large scale, such as nationwide. This paper presents the security architecture of the Austrian citizen card, which aims to provide a secure infrastructure for e-Government applications. We discuss the legal framework enabling e-Government, the requirements for a sustainable security architecture, and the concept of a "security layer" that offers an open interface for high-level security functions. Several short-term e-Government applications are outlined to illustrate the diverse requirements covered by the architecture.

## 1. Introduction
The widespread use of modern communication media, particularly the Internet, has transformed daily routines in both professional and personal contexts. In contrast, many official processes still rely on paper forms and in-person appearances at government offices. The transition to e-Government, facilitated by information and communication technology (ICT), promises to enhance services for citizens while reducing costs and processing times. For example, the workflow of a tax form can be streamlined from downloading, filling out, printing, signing, and mailing to simply entering data into an online form.

Security is a critical concern in e-Government to prevent misuse and ensure the authenticity and integrity of transactions. A comprehensive security architecture is needed to address the diverse requirements of various public proceedings and to support a growing number of users and applications. Additionally, the long-term sustainability of the architecture must consider the integration of future technologies.

In November 2000, the Austrian federal government decided to use chip card technology to simplify official processes for citizens. This decision led to the development of the "Austrian citizen card," which will be issued to all Austrian citizens in 2003/2004. In June 2001, a further cabinet council established a federal Chief Information Officer (CIO) to coordinate ICT and e-Government strategies among stakeholders.

This paper discusses the security implementation of these decisions. We present a scalable and market-open security architecture that meets the requirements laid down in a previous white paper [1]. The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 outlines the security requirements for e-Government, Section 3 covers the legal provisions enabling e-Government, Section 4 introduces the Austrian citizen card concept, Section 5 details the core components of the security architecture, and Section 6 provides an overview of upcoming e-Government applications.

## 2. Requirements in e-Government
The primary security requirements for e-Government include:
- **Entity Authentication:** Verifying that the entity is who they claim to be.
- **Data Origin Authentication:** Confirming the source of the information.
- **Confidentiality:** Ensuring that information is not disclosed to unauthorized entities.
- **Non-Repudiation:** Preventing false denial of having conducted a transaction.

In official proceedings, even a single case of abuse can have severe consequences. Therefore, state-of-the-art technology and proven security measures are essential. Additionally, the large-scale deployment of e-Government should avoid discriminatory practices and be open to the market. Synergies between public and private sectors can also be leveraged to improve the security of e-Commerce.

Figure 1 illustrates a scenario where authorities define standards and interfaces for e-Government applications, ensuring control over the interfaces to avoid vendor lock-ins. Service providers can offer Web portals for citizens to access these applications.

In traditional paper-based processes, security is achieved through identity cards, deeds, witnesses, envelopes, and handwritten signatures. The electronic equivalents include encryption, digital signatures, and PKI. However, establishing a clear link between physical and virtual identities remains a challenge. In Austria, the use of smart cards as the security infrastructure for e-Government processes addresses this issue by providing a consolidated view of the general requirements.

## 3. Legal Provisions vs. Technical Concepts
Public proceedings often require written documentation, handwritten signatures, and the identification of individuals. The following sub-sections discuss the legal provisions that enable these requirements to be met in an electronic format and compare them to technical concepts.

### 3.1 Electronic Signatures
Signature laws regulate the permissibility of electronic signatures as evidence. Digital signatures based on asymmetric cryptography are commonly used, with their equivalence to handwritten signatures being a key aspect. For the European Union, the electronic signature directive [2] states that electronic signatures create the same legal effect as handwritten signatures if certain requirements are met. These electronic signatures, known as qualified signatures, must be created using a secure signature-creation device (SSCD), which interacts with the signer's private key (signature-creation data, SCD).
