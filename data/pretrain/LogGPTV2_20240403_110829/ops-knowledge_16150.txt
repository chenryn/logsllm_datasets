User: You're managing a high-traffic website that occasionally experiences slow page responses. Please list possible causes and provide solutions.
Assistant: The possible reasons are as follows: 1. The server load is too high: reduce the server load pressure by optimizing code and database query, increasing hardware (RAM, CPU, bandwidth, etc.) capacity, caching static content, and using content delivery network (CDN). 2. Excessive network requests: Minimize network requests, shorten page load time, reduce JavaScript and CSS file size, minimize redirects, compress network resources, etc. 3. Database bottlenecks: Alleviate database bottlenecks by running SQL query optimization tools, using efficient query statements, and regularly clearing unnecessary data. 4. Code defects: optimize the code, minimize database query time, reduce DOM operations, build indexes correctly, etc. 5. Insufficient network bandwidth: process client requests within a reasonable time, reduce the size of pictures, videos and other large media files, enable compression options, use cacheable static resources, use CDN, etc. 6. Hardware failure: upgrade server hardware, deploy website in multiple geographic locations and keep data and code in sync, set up automatic server monitoring system, etc. 7. Attack/hacking: Prevent attacks through firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), anti-virus software, etc.; regularly back up important data and restore the original data of the website. If you find a security loophole or abnormal malicious attack, please contact the security team in time. 8. Software version update: timely update the versions of applications, operating systems and other software to ensure that the performance and security of the software are steadily improved. 9. Unreasonable caching strategy: According to the website operation type and data access frequency, adjust cache settings, improve read and write performance, and avoid database data penetration, etc. 10. Third-party network errors: Collect third-party network errors by setting timeouts, monitoring logs, and upgrading your own third-party services in a timely manner. Solutions are based on feasibility for specific reasons and business needs, so a thorough review should be done when identifying options.
