Hi community,
I am glad to announce that ShardingSphere will provide an independent SQL
parser engine for parsing SQLs!  
I believe you will have some of the scenarios or use the SQL parser engine to
get a parsed AST. From now on, you will have another option for your cases.
Here are some of the advantages for ShardingSphere parser engine.
### Advantages
  * Mostly perfect SQL statements supported for MySQL database
  * Mostly perfect SQL statements supported for PostgreSQL database
  * Basically SQL statements supported for SQLServer database
  * Basically SQL statements supported for Oracle database
  * Basically SQL statements supported for SQL92
  * SQL parsed result cache for the parsing performance
  * AST parsed result and SQLStatement parsed result are provided meanwhile
  * Simple extension approach for SQLStatement visitors
  * Simple supplement approach and for SQL definition
  * Continuous improvement for the much better feature in the future.
5.x release will include this one, please wait for our good news! ðŸ˜‰
