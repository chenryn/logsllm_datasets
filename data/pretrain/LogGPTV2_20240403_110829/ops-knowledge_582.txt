### Summary of the Log Chunk

**Time Frame:**
- The log entries span from 18:05:43 to 18:05:53 on October 18th.

**Process and Component:**
- **Process ID:** `LeaseRenewer:msrabi@msra-sa-41:9000`
- **Relevant Software Components:**
  - `org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.LeaseRenewer`
  - `org.apache.hadoop.ipc.Client`

**Key Observations:**

1. **Lease Renewal Failures:**
   - The `LeaseRenewer` component is failing to renew a lease for the client `DFSClient_NONMAPREDUCE_1537864556_1`.
   - The failure duration increases progressively, starting at 46 seconds and ending at 55 seconds.
   - Each failure is followed by a message indicating that a retry will be attempted shortly.

2. **Address Change Detection:**
   - The `org.apache.hadoop.ipc.Client` component is detecting an address change.
   - The old address is `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:9000`.
   - The new address is `msra-sa-41:9000`.

**Detailed Breakdown:**

- **Lease Renewal Failures:**
  - At 18:05:43, the first failure is detected, lasting 46 seconds.
  - Subsequent failures occur every second, with the duration increasing by one second each time (e.g., 47 seconds at 18:05:44, 48 seconds at 18:05:45, and so on).

- **Address Change Detection:**
  - The address change is detected at the same time as the lease renewal failures, occurring every second from 18:05:44 to 18:05:53.
  - The address change is consistent, always from `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:9000` to `msra-sa-41:9000`.

**Conclusion:**
- The log indicates a recurring issue where the `LeaseRenewer` is unable to renew the lease for the specified DFS client, with the failure duration increasing over time.
- Concurrently, the `org.apache.hadoop.ipc.Client` is detecting an address change, which may be related to the lease renewal failures.
