This one.
To reproduce it, change the width of your browser so you get the mobile/ipad
dropdown menu. Click it, and then expand the window again so you get the
standard bar. Now try to click either of the normal dropdowns, and it won't
show at all.
Not sure how common it is for users to do this, but the issue is definitely
there.
