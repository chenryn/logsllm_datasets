## Steps to Reproduce
I installed git and flutter onto my windows 10 computer. I followed the
tutorial and entered the command:
flutter doctor
Then it looks like it tries to update the flutter tool but it fails every time
and then tries to update again in an infinite loop of updating and failing.
## Flutter Doctor
    PS C:\WINDOWS\system32> flutter doctor
    Updating flutter tool...
    %1 is not a valid Win32 application.
      Command: C:\Users\[username]\flutter\bin\cache\dart-sdk\lib\_internal\pub\asset\7zip\7za.exe e data.tar.gz
    Unhandled exception:

    ter_tools/bin/flutter_tools.dart": Packages file 'file:///C:/Users/[username]/flutter/packages/flutter_tools/.pa
    ckages' not found.
    null
    Updating flutter tool...

This just keeps going on forever. What am I doing wrong?
