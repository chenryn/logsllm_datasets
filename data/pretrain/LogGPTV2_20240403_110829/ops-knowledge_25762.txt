User: I have python3.4.0 installed on my system.
Today, I want to install python3.4.3, so I download the source code and install it.
However, my idle is still python3.4.0
while when I type python3 in terminal, it shows python3.4.3.
I also have pandas installed on my old version, it still can be used on my idle (linked with 3.4.0) but not with python3.4.3.
My question is how I can just sticked to python3.4.3 and make everything run in it.
Assistant: I asked some questions in a comments.  However, starting Idle with python3 -m idlelib will start Idle with whatever python is started with python3.  Since you say that python3 starts 3.4.3, the above should run Idle 3.4.3.
