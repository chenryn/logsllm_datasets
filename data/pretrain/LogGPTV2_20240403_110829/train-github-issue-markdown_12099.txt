### Problem description
In landscape mode, the datepicker doesn't seem to be centered vertically on
the screen so the bottom is cut off on smaller resolutions. You can also
observe this by looking at the material-ui demos in iphone5 landscape mode
(see screenshot). By playing around in responsive mode, it appears there is
some enforced minimum margin from top to account for a navbar (even if there's
not one present). Is an always visible nav bar part of the material design
spec?

I looked through open and closed issues and didn't find this. I also tried
switching between margin-top and padding-top on the main content div with no
difference. Maybe there's a css trick I am not aware of?
