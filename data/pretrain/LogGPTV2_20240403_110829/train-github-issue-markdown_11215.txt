After installing TensorFlow, I noticed that only one folder, `tensorflow/include`, was present in the installation directory. However, it should also contain several other folders, such as `third_party`, `google`, and `Eigen`. I am unsure why these additional folders are missing.

I installed TensorFlow using the following command:
```bash
sudo pip install --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/gpu/tensorflow-0.7.1-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.whl
```

Could you please help me understand why these folders are not included in the installation?

Thank you.
