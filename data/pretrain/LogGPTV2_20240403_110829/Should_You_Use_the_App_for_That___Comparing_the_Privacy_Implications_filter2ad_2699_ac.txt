### Summary of PII Leaks by Service, OS, and Category

**Table 1: Summary of Tested Services, Broken Down by OS and Category**

The majority of the tested services leak personally identifiable information (PII), with mobile applications leaking more frequently than their corresponding websites. The types of leaked identifiers include:

- Birthday
- Device Information
- Email Address
- Gender
- Location
- Name
- Phone Number
- Username
- Password
- Unique Identifiers

**Case Studies:**

- **Grubhub:** Confirmed that passwords were inadvertently sent via an encrypted connection to `taplytics.com`, their analytics provider. Grubhub acknowledged this as a bug and released a new app version within a week, confirming the deletion of all data sent in error.
  
- **JetBlue:** Informed us that the password was intentionally sent to `usablenet.com` for authentication purposes. JetBlue uses encryption both during transmission and before storing the password, adhering to best practices.

- **Food Network and NCAA Sports:** These services do not inform users that their credentials are managed by a third party. The login pages are hosted by the primary site but do not mention the involvement of the third party.

**Analysis of PII Leaks by Category:**

- **Shopping and Travel Services:** Leak the widest variety of PII, including phone numbers, usernames, and passwords, often via HTTPS.
- **Business and Weather Apps:** Leak the fewest types of PII.

**Summary:**

- PII leaks are pervasive and vary by app category.
- Generally, apps leak more PII than websites because they can access more types of PII stored on the device.
- Education and Weather services are the most promiscuous in terms of leaking PII, contacting the largest number of domains, but they leak fewer types of PII compared to other categories.

### Differences in PII Leaks Between App and Web Versions

**Number of Domains Receiving PII Leaks:**

- **Figure 1d** shows a cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the difference in the number of domains receiving PII leaks between app and web versions. Negative values indicate that the website leaked PII to more domains. The data shows a slight bias toward apps leaking PII to more domains.

**Distinct Types of PII Leaked:**

- **Figure 1e** presents a probability density function (PDF) of the difference in the number of distinct PII types leaked by app and web versions. The most common case is that the app version leaks one more type of PII than the website, with a strong bias toward apps leaking more distinct types of PII.

**Overlap in Leaked PII:**

- **Figure 1f** plots a CDF of Jaccard index values for the PII leaked by each serviceâ€™s web and app versions. The Jaccard index measures set similarity, where 0 indicates no overlap and 1 indicates identical sets. The analysis shows that the types of PII leaked by web and app versions share nothing in common more than half of the time. Overall, 80-90% of services share only 50% of the PII types leaked across both platforms.

**Key Observations:**

- The differences in PII leaks are expected due to the different mechanisms available for tracking. For example, apps can use unique device identifiers, while websites typically use cookie IDs and cookie matching.
- In many cases, the differences in PII leaks are substantial. For instance, Priceline leaks birthdays and gender from their website but not from their iOS or Android apps, which in turn leak different PII.

**Conclusion:**

- Apps are more likely to leak more types of PII than their web counterparts.
- Most online services leak substantially different PII over the two media (app and web).

This structured summary provides a clear and professional overview of the findings, making it easier to understand the key points and trends in PII leaks across different services and platforms.
