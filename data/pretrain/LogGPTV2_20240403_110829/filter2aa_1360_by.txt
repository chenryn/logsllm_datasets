was someone else with my name. It disclosed the following details.
We now see the purchased items, purchase dates, rebate amounts, and payment details. This gives 
into the shopping habits of the target and could lead to patterns of behavior which might expose 
routines. It could also provide pretext value. I could initiate an email phishing attack focused on a 
purchased item announcing a problem with the rebate. That would be so targeted that the recipient would 
probably click whatever link I sent. This rebate sendee even stores all purchases within a static URL which is 
prone to abuse. If my name were Michael Smith and I lived at 1212 Main Street in Houston, Texas, my URL 
would be the following.
This impressive site does not identify’ home addresses. Instead, it focuses on business details likely scraped from 
Unkedln and online resumes. Conducting a search on die website only presents a login form and an account is 
mandatory. However, Google can help us. I conducted the following search.
I find this technique more "interesting" than valuable to an investigation, but you might locate a nugget of 
information which assists you. As an example, let's look at the store Menards. Menards is an American home 
improvement company which pushes rebates in order to make products appear low-priced. When you buy a 
product, you can retrieve a rebate slip and mail it off. In a few weeks, numerous checks in small amounts begin 
arriving at your home. This game provides small discounts, but at what risk? This is where the online rebate 
center comes in. Let's start with a visit to https://rebateinternational.com/Rebatelnternational/tracking.do. 
This page allows you to enter a first initial, last name, numeric portion of an address, and postal code of your 
target. This result appears similar to Figure 17.01.

This allows us to potentially translate an unknown cell number into a name and address or vice-versa, as well as 
obtain shopping history of the target. These two examples arc only a small selection of the possibilities. You will 
find online portals for Micro Center, Budweiser, Miller, Kohls, Auto Stores, and other retail establishments. I 
have found the following three Google searches to assist with finding companies which offer similar options.
If you know your target's telephone number and postal code, you may be able to uncover an entire home address. 
Consider the following example with the home telephone and internet service provider CenturyLink. The 
following address connects to their internet troubleshooting page.
https://www.google.com/search?q=intitle:"rebate center" 
https:/1 www.google.com/scarch?q=“track+my+rebate” 
https://www.google.com/search?q=“track+your+rebate”
The abundance of free person search tools can get overwhelming. They each have strengths and weaknesses, 
and none of them are consistent on accurate results. In years past, I would manually visit each site and enter my 
target information. This would usually result in small, yet valuable, pieces of information from each service. 
Today, I use a custom search tool that I created to search all possible sites simultaneously. This free tool will 
not locate any information that you could not find manually. Instead, it attempts to save you time by automating 
the process. Figure 17.03 displays the current state of the tool, which is in your downloaded archive from earlier. 
You can either enter the first and last name of your target within the search fields of each service, or enter this 
information only once at the final set of search fields. This latter option will launch several new tabs and conduct 
your search across each service.
Clicking "Open Troubleshooter" in the lower right area opens a query page asking for the telephone number 
and postal code. Submitting this data then presents a confirmation screen which includes the customer's name, 
full address, and telephone number. I have found many local utilities which offer similar search portals.
Note that this URL does not require any credentialing and is open to brute-force scraping. Next, let's take a look 
at Lowe's home improvement. They offer a rebate confirmation website at https://lowes-rebates.com/en- 
us/RebateStatus which allows entry of a cellular number or home address, as seen in Figure 17.02.
During my live training courses, I am often questioned about the absence of the ability to enter a middle initial 
or name. While I could make this an option, 1 find that a lot of people search websites do not always possess a 
middle name. Therefore, entering this data could harm an investigation by omitting valuable results.

Classmates is a ven' underrated resource for the internet searcher. Unfortunately, you must create a free account 
to take advantage of the worthy information inside the site. This free account can contain fictitious information 
and it is necessary- to complete a profile on the site to access the premium features. After you arc logged in, you 
can search by first and last name. If you know the school that was attended, the results will be much more 
accurate. This should provide die school attended as well as the years the target attended the school. My new 
interest in this site is due to the availability’ of scanned yearbooks. The collection is far from complete, but there 
arc a surprising number of complete yearbooks available to browse. Analyzing this content can be very time 
consuming, as the yearbook must be manually browsed one page at a time. The information obtained should be 
unique from any internet search previously conducted.
is minima istic site provides a simple interface to find out how many people exist that have a specific name. 
n casc» there are 16 people in the United States with my’ name. This is obtained from census data and can 
ic p etermine how effective a targeted search will be. For example, if your target has a ven' unique name, you 
may still get numerous results to links of social network sites. In order to determine the likelihood that all of 
t ese pro i es apply to the target, How Many’ Of Me can tell you whether your target is the only’ person that has 
t lat name. This site provides no intelligence about someone with a common name. 1 have used this in the past 
to determine appropriate coven names to use online.

This website allows users to create free professional resumes and CVs. Currendy, over 5 million have been 
created and are stored within the service. The home page does not offer a search option, as this service is not 
intended to be used as a people finder. However, we can rely on a Google search to get us the content we want. 
The following identifies the resume of our target.
Resume searching was mentioned earlier. Those methods will identify many documents, especially if the word 
’'resume” is inside the file or file name. These results are only a portion of available content that could be 
extremely valuable to your investigation. I believe that resumes are an ideal target since they usually contain 
sensitive information that is not posted anywhere else. Many people will include a cellular number and personal 
email address on a resume, but would never consider placing these details on a social network. If the resume is 
publicly available, regardless of whether the target realizes this, we can gather good intelligence. The following 
techniques aim to assist in locating this valuable data. Detailed searches within Google or Bing will identify many 
resumes hosted publicly on websites and doud-based document storage services. If my target’s name is Michael 
Bazzell, I have found the following exact searches valuable on Google, Bing, and Yandex.
"Michael Bazzell" "Resume”
"Michael Bazzell" "Curriculum Vitae"
"Michael Bazzell" "CV"
"Michael Bazzell" "Resume" filetype:doc
"Michael Bazzell" "Curriculum Vitae" filetype:doc
"Michael Bazzell" "CV" filetype:doc
"Michael Bazzell" "Resume" filetype:pdf
"Michael Bazzell" "Curriculum Vitae" filetype:pdf
"Michael Bazzell" "CV" filetype:pdf
"Michael Bazzell" "Resume" site:docs.google.com
"Michael Bazzell" "Curriculum Vitae" site:docs.google.com
"Michael Bazzell" "CV" site:docs.google.com
The search result opens a PDF. Within that file is the un-redacted content, which identifies his full email address, 
telephone number, and home address. On rare occasions, I have found this PDF option to be missing from my 
target profile. When this happens, we can create a direct link to the full details. In this example, our target's page 
is at cvmkr.com/7J0N. The following URL presents the entire PDF with the visible details. Basically, adding 
"?pdf=l" at the end of the URL should always present the full resume view. Since Google indexes all of the 
PDF files that are located, you can also perform searches for telephone numbers and email addresses using the 
site operator previously mentioned.
While these queries will likely locate any resumes with text, they will fail on many resume images. Numerous 
resume hosting websites have realized that various data scraping engines scour their resume collection and 
"steal" their content. This has encouraged some services to store images of resumes that do not contain text 
that can be easily searched. While this is a decent layer of protection, it is not enough to keep out of Google 
results. Since Google scans images for Optical Character Recognition (OCR), it knows what words are within 
an image. After conducting the previous queries within traditional search engines, attempt them through Google 
Images fimages.google.com). A search of "Mary Johnson" "Resume" on Google Images revealed hundreds of 
images of resumes. A manual inspection of each identified many pieces of sensitive information.

If your target conducts any type of business with the public, he or she will likely upset someone at some point 
If your target regularly provides bad service or intentionally commits fraud within the business, there are likely 
many upset victims. Ripoff Report is a user-submitted collection of complaints about businesses and individuals. 
1 have had numerous investigations into shady people and businesses where these reviews by previously 
unknown victims were beneficial.
Items: While it may be fun to look at the items desired by a couple, there is much we can learn about their lives 
based on these details. In an example from Figure 17.04, I now know that a random Michael Wilson, who is 
getting married in San /Xntonio, will be going to his honeymoon in Maui (#2), snorkeling (#3), at the airport 
carrying a Lowcpro backpack (#4), checking red/black suitcases (#5), capturing everything on a Canon HD 
camcorder (#6), dining at the Lahaina Grill (#7), and staying at a fancy nearby’ hotel (#8).
Indeed has a powerful collection of resume data. Because the term "resume" is not present in any’ of the content 
pages, you will likely not obtain this data during your standard searches. Entering your target name on Indeed 
under the "Find Candidates" option may present new results. Contact information is usually' redacted. However, 
detailed work experience, education, and location are commonly present.
Maiden Name: In the example above, the results only’ identified future weddings. However, modifying 
in the search menu allows us to view past weddings. This will divulge a woman s maiden name. s c 
beneficial in order to better locate a Facebook page or other family’ members that may’ be off my ra 
also use this to then search old yearbooks, criminal details, and previous addresses.
Date / State: Many counties will only share marriage certificates if the requestor knows the exact names of $ 
party’ and the exact date of the event. We have everything we need in order to file a request. Marriage cern 
often include full details of all parents, witnesses, and the officiant. Furthermore, I now have t eir annixe 
date which can be helpful during a phishing attack or social engineering attempt. You might be surpnse 
number of people that use their anniversary’ as a security’ question to an online account.
Ceremony Details: The Knot and other wedding registry sites offer the couple a free website to announ 
details about the upcoming (or past) event. This usually includes an embellished story’ about how they met, 
in love, and he proposed. While this could be good knowledge for social engineering, I am usua y m 
interested in the wedding party’. This will usually include the closest friends of my target, which wi e next 
my investigation list
Decades ago, people were surprised at the gifts presented to them after a wedding or birth. Today’, we create 
online registries identifying the exact products desired, and within moments someone can purchase and ship the 
"thoughtful" gift with very’ little effort. As an investigator, I have always enjoyed the plethora of personal details 
within these registries, which tend to stay’ online long after the related event. Before identifying the best 
resources, let's take a look at the types of details we can acquire from some random targets.
Partner Name: When I am investigating someone, that person usually’ knows they’ are under a microscope. He 
or she tends to stop posting to social media and starts scrubbing any’ online details. However, their partner tends 
to ignore the threat of investigation and continues to upload sensitive information applicable to the target 
Therefore, online wedding and baby’ registries help me identify the most lucrative target aside from the original 
suspect. In an example from the wedding registry’ website theknot.com, 1 received over 200 results for Michael 
Wilson, which also includes the name of the future spouse.
