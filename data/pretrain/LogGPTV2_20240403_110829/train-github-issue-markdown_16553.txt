Previously if you were at the terminal and typed "atom" it opened the current
directory in atom. As of a recent release, it now opens an empty window. To
achieve the same result as before one must now type "atom .". I understand
making changes and that relearning will be required, but it does seem like
consistency across github CLI's should be important. GitHub for Mac opens the
current directory if you simply type "github". This means one github product
requires "." for the current directory and another does not. Now I'm left in a
state of never getting it right for either of them. :)
