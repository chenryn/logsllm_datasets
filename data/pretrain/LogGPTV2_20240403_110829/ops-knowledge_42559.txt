User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题MySQL suddenly not working on Windows Server 2003 I installed PHP and MySQL on our windows 2003 server about 3 months ago. Everything has been working wonderfully, but for some reason when I came into work this morning, the service had stopped working. I proceeded to start the service up again, shortly there after the service stopped again. In the Event Log for the server I have the following errors:

Application Event: Source: Application Error, Category 100, Event ID: 1000, Description: Faulting application mysqld.exe, version 0.0.0.0, faulting module mysqld.exe, version 0.0.0.0, fault address 0x002aafd7.

System Event: Source: Service Control Manager, Description: The MySQL service terminated unexpectedly. It has done this 2 time(s).

I figured something was just buggy, so I rebooted the server, same problem. As far as I know, nothing was changed on the server over the weekend.

When I launched MySQL Administrator that installed with it, And click on the Server logs, their is no information, and most boxes are grayed out.

If somebody could point me in the right direction it would be greatly appreciated.

Assistant: From the looks of your logs, you're hitting database errors.  Ideally this would not cause the service to crash.  I would look into the mysqlcheck and the associated table repair utilities to see about repairing any database errors you might have to see if that clears things up.
