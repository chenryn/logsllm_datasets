Maybe this is actually an issue with Visual Studio, but when I create a
typescript project and provoke a build error, I'll get the error message twice
in the Error List - one time from IntelliSense and one time from the compiler.
And it looks like - when doing something similar in C# - the error messages
are merged when they are identical. I do not know, if that is actually how it
works, but it would explain the behavior, because the message from the
TypeScript compiler is prefixed with "Build: " and for some strange reason the
error code does not show up in the the list either, so the messages are not
identical.

If that's not the case, the question remains: why are errors shown twice for
TypeScript, but not for C#? :)
