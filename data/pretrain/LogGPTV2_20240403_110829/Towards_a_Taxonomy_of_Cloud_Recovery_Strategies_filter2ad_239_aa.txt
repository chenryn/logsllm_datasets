## Abstract

Recovering from failures during sporadic operations, such as rolling upgrades or migrations, is challenging because the application must continue to provide service. This necessitates recovery strategies that can handle both normal and sporadic operations. To derive methods for recovering from failures in sporadic operations, we classify existing methods into four categories based on their purpose and the lifecycle phase for which they are applicable. This taxonomy not only facilitates research on the recoverability of cloud sporadic operations but also enhances understanding of existing cloud recovery strategies.

**Keywords:** cloud recovery, consumer-initiated, sporadic operations

## I. Introduction

From a cloud consumer's perspective, recovering from cloud failures is challenging due to limited visibility and control provided by cloud platforms. For example, in AWS, consumers cannot explicitly assign a specific IP address to an instance, requiring clients of a failed instance to rediscover its replacement. Sporadic operations like upgrades or migrations can fail due to operational and application errors. Industry practice often involves turning off monitoring features during these operations to avoid false positives, potentially reducing the dependability of cloud applications. While several recovery strategies exist for cloud sporadic operations, they often focus on operational errors and neglect application errors. A comprehensive recovery mechanism for sporadic operations may need to integrate various cloud recovery strategies. Therefore, to propose fine-grained recovery mechanisms, we analyze and classify existing cloud recovery strategies.

## II. Methodology of Establishing the Taxonomy

We establish the taxonomy through a three-step approach:
1. **Defining Research Questions:** Our goal is to provide a taxonomy for existing cloud recovery strategies to facilitate research on recoverability for sporadic operations. We define the following research questions:
   - What are the existing cloud recovery strategies?
   - What types of activities (normal or sporadic) are these methods applicable to?
   - In which phases of the activity lifecycle are these methods applicable?

2. **Literature Review and Data Extraction:** To answer the first research question, we reviewed existing cloud recovery strategies and extracted data on several recovery methods, including rollback recovery, disaster recovery, virtual machine replication, fault-tolerance, recovery for cloud internal protocols, test-driven scripts, exception handling, recovery for operations as transactions, recovery for operations as processes, and user-guided recovery for cloud applications.

3. **Data Analysis:** To answer the second and third research questions, we analyzed the types of activities (normal or sporadic) and the lifecycle phases (design or runtime) for which these recovery methods are designed. Normal activities include the regular operations of cloud applications, while sporadic activities include deployment and upgrades. The two dimensions—activity type and lifecycle phase—form the basis of our classification.

## III. Literature Review for Cloud Recovery

We organized cloud recovery strategies into Table I, providing examples for each strategy.

| **Recovery Strategies** | **Examples** |
|-------------------------|--------------|
| Cloud Application Rollback | Checkpoint-based rollback, Log-based rollback |
| Disaster Recovery | Geographical redundancy, Cloud storage replication |
| Virtual Machine Replication | Remus, Recovery Block |
| Fault-Tolerance | N-version Programming, Parallel, FTCloud |
| Recovery for Cloud Internal Protocols | FATE&DESTINI |
| Test Driven Scripts | Chef mini test, Script exceptions handling |
| Cloud Operations Exception Handling | Cloud management tool exceptions handling |
| Recovery for Cloud Operations as Transactions | Forward recovery, Backward recovery |
| Recovery for Cloud Operations as Processes | Operation undo & redo, Reparation |
| User Guided Recovery for Cloud Applications | Recovery plan generation |

### A. Cloud Application Rollback

Rollback treats a cloud distributed system as a collection of application processes communicating over the network. It can be classified into two categories: checkpoint-based rollback and log-based rollback. Checkpoint-based rollback involves reverting to a previously saved consistent checkpoint, while log-based rollback combines checkpointing with logging of nondeterministic events. Both methods are intended for applications running in the cloud during runtime, with checkpoints and event logs generated and recovery actions taken at runtime. A key challenge is the overhead of making checkpoints and the efficiency of retrieving and understanding them for rollback recovery.

### B. Disaster Recovery

Disaster recovery strategies, such as geographical redundancy and cloud storage replication, ensure data and application availability in the event of a catastrophic failure. These methods are typically designed for the runtime phase of both normal and sporadic activities.

## IV. Data Analysis and Taxonomy

Our taxonomy is based on two dimensions: the type of activity (normal or sporadic) and the lifecycle phase (design or runtime). This forms a two-dimensional coordinate chart, as shown in Figure 2. We then place the identified recovery strategies into the appropriate blocks of the chart.

## V. Discussion

The proposed taxonomy provides a structured way to understand and categorize existing cloud recovery strategies. By considering both the type of activity and the lifecycle phase, it helps in designing more effective and comprehensive recovery mechanisms for cloud applications.

## VI. Conclusion and Future Work

In this paper, we have presented a taxonomy of cloud recovery strategies, classifying them based on their purpose and the lifecycle phase for which they are applicable. This taxonomy not only aids in the research on recoverability for sporadic operations but also enhances the understanding of existing recovery methods. Future work will involve validating the taxonomy with real-world case studies and developing new recovery mechanisms based on the insights gained from this classification.
