perspective, peak load in ERCOT is around 70GW, and 1% of
70GW is 700MW, which is much smaller than the 2700MW
of reserves carried in ERCOT to satisfy the N-1 criterion.
While an increase by 700MW in load due to an IoT attack
(and the reaction by generation reserves) would result in some-
what different changes in transmission ﬂows compared to the
effect of a 700MW decrease in generation (and the reaction
by generation reserves), we believe that it is unlikely that an
increase in load of 1% would result in any unacceptably ad-
verse conditions on the transmission system. This is because
load is geographically distributed around the system, so that
it is unlikely for there to be a more than a 1% increase in most
transmission ﬂows, and it is unlikely that the system is oper-
ating such that a 1% increase in current would immediately
trigger the overload protection.
In the Eastern and Western Interconnections of North Amer-
ica, the total load is much larger (several hundred GW) but
even 1% of this would only amount to slightly more than the
double outage of a nuclear unit (plus it would require millions
of compromised IoT devices). To summarize, the results of
the Polish power grid reported by Soltan et al. [47] suggest
that the system being modeled is not N-1 secure.

5.2.2
10% Demand Increase Attack
In Figure 11, we can see that the power ﬂow of some
branches slightly increases after the attack at second 1. How-
ever, no transmission line is overloaded resulting from the
IoT 1% load increase attack. Note that some branches are ini-
tially overloaded before the simulation and remain unchanged
during the simulation and the overload outage checker is not
activated on those lines under the assumption that protection
in the actual system would not have been activated under
these conditions.
Ten percent of system load in our case study is equivalent to
8,227.3 MW, which would be equivalent to an adversary con-
trolling over eight million air conditioners. Figure 12 shows
the bus frequency responses after a 10% load increase attack
at 1s and Figure 13 shows the power ﬂow on branches as a
percent of the branch rated capacity.
To better understand the variations of power ﬂow depicted
in Figure 13, let’s ﬁrst take a look at Figure 12. From Figure
12, we can observe that the bus frequencies plummet after the

crease.

attack begins (1s). The only lines that are not affected are the
few buses that connected our power grid to another region
outside the system with DC tie lines (the frequencies at the
top of the ﬁgure).
In contrast to the previous 1% attack, with a 10% demand
increase the power system needs to activate protection algo-
rithms; in particular, 5% UFLS is activated at 3.5 seconds by
shedding 5% of the system load. Again, as long as the bus
frequency converges to a stable level, the differences between
the converged value and its initial value of 60 Hz can be ﬁxed
either automatically or manually over a longer time scale.
Although the under frequency shedding has no deliberate
time delay as indicated in Table 3, a 0.02 second of relay
operation time is included in the simulation. Therefore, the
load shedding occurs 0.02 seconds after the time frequency
falls below the ﬁrst UFLS threshold of 59.3 Hz.
In Figure 13, we can see that the power ﬂows of some
branches increase after the attack starts (1 sec.). However, the
power ﬂows of those branches drop to or gradually decrease
to roughly their initial values after the under frequency load
shedding protection is activated at 3.5 seconds. Therefore,
at the end of the simulation there is no additional transmis-
sion line overloaded. Note that some branches are initially
overloaded before the simulation and remain unchanged dur-
ing the simulation and so, as in the previous example, the
protection mechanisms for these transmission lines are not
activated.
Even with the assumption of millions of compromised IoT
devices to affect 10% of our load, our results show that the
power grid protections to prevent generators from disconnect-
ing from the system are effective in mitigating any further
problem. The amount of UFLS is intended to reﬂect ERCOT
standards. The Eastern and Western Interconnections may
have overall lower levels of UFLS than ERCOT; however,
they have much larger levels of inertia than ERCOT.
Increase and Decrease Attack
5.3
One of the characteristics of IoT attacks, is that they are highly
distributed they are hard to detect. Once the load is compro-
mised, the compromised devices are unlikely to be removed
from the grid (or the Internet) in a short time after they launch
the ﬁrst attack. Therefore attackers can launch a sequence
of attacks, the ﬁrst as an attempt to drive the system to a
vulnerable state, and the second to exploit that vulnerability.
In the last attack we saw how under frequency load shed-
ding successfully prevented a cascading failure of transmis-
sion lines from a single 10% load increase attack. However, a
sophisticated attacker can identify when the system frequency
starts rebounding after the initial drop, and can attempt to
make this trend continue by immediately decreasing electric-
ity consumption. This can cause a frequency overshoot that
may trigger the action of over-frequency protection relays
on the generators and disconnect them from the power grid;
creating another cycle of frequency decrease along with new
load shedding etc.
A straightforward approach in this experiment is to increase
the load at the ﬁrst attack and decrease the same amount of
load at the second attack. However, we investigate a poten-
tially worse scenario where in the second attack, we decrease
by twice the amount of the load increase in the ﬁrst attack (mi-
nus the percentage of the load that the attacker loses control
of after the under frequency load shedding implementation).
The result in Figure 14 shows that the frequency does over-
shoot after the loads decrease at second 20, however the sys-
tem frequency tends to stabilize at 61.7 Hz, which happens
about 10 seconds later. From Table 2, we can observe that
1126    28th USENIX Security Symposium

frequency needs additional measures to be brought back to its
initial frequency of 60 Hz, the frequency decline caused by
10% of system load increase can be stopped by only 5% of
system load shedding. In Table 3 we can see that in ERCOT,
25% of the system load is contracted as UFLS. Under this
condition, the adversary needs to apply the attack at least ﬁve
times to deplete the UFLS resources. What is more, additional
under-frequency relays may be installed on transmission fa-
cilities with the approval of the ISO provided the relays are
set at 58.0 Hz or below in the real system [5]. That means,
in reality, the adversary may need to apply the attack even
more times to deplete the UFLS and cause a possible system
failure.
Therefore, it may take many cycles of IoT demand increase
and decrease attacks to deplete the UFLS resources, and these
cycles will not only deplete the resources from a defensive
stand point, but also the resources available to the adversary
as each activation of UFLS will remove loads controlled by
the attacker. Therefore, the efﬁciency, even the feasibility of
the approach of using up the UFLS by such repeated IoT
demand attack remains unclear.
5.4 Bifurcations, and Generator Tripping
5.4.1
30% Load Increase Attack
In Section 5.3, we brieﬂy discussed the potential threats of
generator disconnections caused by over frequency protec-
tions. In this section, we extend this discussion to IoT attacks
that speciﬁcally target disturbing frequency and causing gen-
erator disconnections by frequency protection. In order to
observe the response of frequency protection at generators,
we study the impact of a MadIoT attack consisting of a load
increase or decrease by 30%.
In previous work [47], this 30% load change attack was
able to disconnect all generators of the (simpliﬁed) North
American Western Interconnection, causing a complete sys-
tem blackout. In our system, a 30% load increase attack would
require the attacker to compromise about 24 million air con-
ditioners.
Figure 15 shows the frequency response of our system
to a MadIoT attack that increases the system load by 30%.
First, we can observe that due to the sudden load increase, the
bus frequencies decline dramatically and some of them drop
quickly below the ﬁrst UFLS threshold of 59.3 Hz. At this
point 5% of the system load is disconnected by UFLS.
We notice that the frequency in some buses decline at
a slower rate than others and they do not reach any UFLS
thresholds. For convenience, we name this set of buses Group
1. The buses with DC tie lines are again less affected, and
we call this set of buses Group 2. The group of buses whose
frequencies decline faster and drop below UFLS thresholds
are named Group 3. The group names are indicated in Figure
15.
Figure 14: Frequency Response to a Cycle of Load Increase
and Decrease
61.7 Hz will not cause an immediate generation trip by the
frequency protections at the generators.
As mentioned in Section 5.2, a 10% system load compro-
mised by the adversary is already a pessimistic assumption.
We take this even further to 20% of the system load in this
simulation to see if the IoT attack can cause a cascading result.
However, we still do not observe an immediate generation
trip after this demand increase and decrease attack in a system
that is intended to reﬂect ERCOT standards for UFLS.
5.3.1 Under Frequency Load Shedding in a Repeated
IoT Attack
We have explored the results of an attack “cycle” of load
increase and decrease. The adversary could continue repeating
this attack cycle of increasing and reducing the compromised
load as long as their capabilities are not disabled by the load
shedding mechanism.
The under frequency load shedding would disconnect some
amount of demand each time when the IoT attack causes
the frequency drop below any thresholds. Once the load is
disconnected by Under-Frequency Load Shedding (UFLS)
systems, the restoration of shed load is coordinated between
the Independent System Operator (ISO), Transmission Ser-
vice Providers (TSPs) and Distribution Service Providers
(DSPs) [5]. It is fair to assume that such restoration, which
requires coordination between different entities may take a
relatively long time to complete. Therefore, a potential nega-
tive effect of such repeated attacks is that they can deplete the
under frequency load shedding resources before they are re-
stored, which might eventually lead to having no more UFLS
protections against the attacks and will eventually cause a
generator to trip.
The result in Figure 12 shows that although the system

Figure 15: Frequency Response to 30% Load Increase.
Figure 16: Frequency Response to 30% Load Decrease.
Notice that, even within a group, the frequency responses
are not exactly the same. Because of the ﬁrst UFLS action,
the frequency deviation between buses increases. After the
5% load shed, the frequency of Group 1 starts to increase–
potentially this group has more generators in their region—
while the frequency of Group 3 keeps declining–indicating
that this region of the grid has insufﬁcient generation of elec-
trical power.
Shortly afterwards, the frequency of Group 3 declines to
the point where the second and third UFLS thresholds, 58.9Hz
and 58.3Hz, need to be activated (at around 2.6 seconds and
5.6 seconds respectively). An additional 10% of system load
is disconnected in each occasion. The frequency deviation
between Group 1 and Group 3 gets larger after the two UFLSs.
What is more, the frequency deviation between buses in a
group, especially in Group 1, increases after the actions of
UFLS.
After the three activations of UFLSs for group 3, which
disconnect a total 25% of system load, the frequency decline
at Group 3 is stopped. Because there is no additional load
shedding, the frequency at Group 1 stops increasing as well.
Thus, although the bus frequencies have not converged at the
end of the simulation, they stop diverging and there is no need
to activate frequency protections to disconnect generators.
5.4.2 30% Load Decrease Attack
We now study what happens if instead of increasing the load
by 30%, we decrease the load by 30%. In this case we ex-
pect the frequencies in all buses to increase dramatically;
furthermore, because UFLS can only be activated when the
frequency is decreasing, then we know that there are no im-
mediate protections to prevent a generator from disconnecting
from the grid because of its over-frequency protections.
Figure 16 shows the system frequency response to a Ma-
dIoT attack that decreases the system load by 30%. We can
see that the bus frequencies increase after the attack and a few
of them go above the threshold of immediate over frequency
protections at generators, which is 61.8 Hz within 5 seconds.
The over frequency protections then disconnect generators,
resulting in a 25% reduction of system generation. After the
tripping of generators, the bus frequencies reduce and con-
verge to a value close to 60 Hz and no more protection actions
or failures are observed.
Because we model the time in which each generator is
disconnected, we can see that not all of them are disconnected
synchronously, as suggested in prior work, but at different
times, depending on their conﬁguration settings. When some
generators are disconnected, then the frequency drops and is
stabilized by the remaining generators.
Compared to the system frequency response to an IoT
attack that increases the system load, we ﬁnd that the bus
frequencies react differently to the IoT attack that decreases
the system load. In Figure 16, although the frequencies of
some buses increase faster than those in some other buses,
the frequencies gradually converge after 25% of the system
generation is tripped. One of the conclusions we can draw
from this comparison is that a quick protection reaction in big
scales like the generation tripping in Figure 16 performs better
than the gradual protection actions like the load shedding in
Figure 15 in terms of the system frequency restoration.
We also ﬁnd that the tripped generations in this simulation
consist of a signiﬁcant amount of wind generation. The ben-
eﬁt of disconnecting the wind generation or any generation
that doesn’t provide inertia in this condition is that the system
loses less inertia after the over frequency protection action.
Therefore, the system doesn’t become weaker in terms of
1128    28th USENIX Security Symposium

maintaining frequency stability. This phenomenon suggests
that generation that doesn’t provide inertia could be included
in the over frequency protection to protect the system against
any following attacks targeted at disturbing the system fre-
quency after an IoT attack.
6 Limitations
Our results also assume that all grid operators satisfy the N-1
security criterion. This is the general practice and should be
expected as operators can get massive ﬁnes if they are found
to be in violation of this criterion. Having said that, some
blackouts have occurred because operators believe they are
satisfying the N-1 criterion but a misconﬁgured protection
device that should have been activated during an event was
not activated, and this created an unanticipated N-2 event that
initiated a cascading failure. As discussed in our summary
of related work on cascading analysis, stochastic models can
complement our approach by establishing the risk or like-
lihood that one of our protection devices does not work as
expected and causes a series of cascading events.
We believe the type of protections considered in this study
is the subset of the protections in power systems that would
contribute to a cascading outage the most after a disturbance
in the system. However, future work can be done to ex-
plore the impacts from other protections that are commonly
equipped in the power systems e.g. differential and distance
protections on buses [31]. In addition, in this study, we con-
sidered only an IoT demand attack that is evenly distributed
across all the load points in the system. However, in future
work, we will consider how feasible it is to compromise a
large-scale set of high wattage IoT devices in a speciﬁc geo-
graphical area such that that target only a part of the system.
While both security researchers and industry practitioners
have worked on the security of the power grid for a decade,
their focus has been on understanding and preventing attacks
to devices in the bulk of the power grid [7, 17, 38, 48, 51],
i.e., the components controlling the operation of the electrical
transmission system in large geographical areas and the Su-
pervisory Control and Data Acquisitions (SCADA) systems.
While in the U.S. the bulk power system is regulated to
maintain a minimal set of cybersecurity standards [7], there
is a growing push to start improving the security of systems
in the distribution network. On October 19th 2017, the Fed-
eral Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) proposed new
mandatory cybersecurity controls to address the risk posed by,
for example, smaller grid control centers that are typically less
critical than major control centers, but which are nonetheless
vulnerable to attacks [9].
Load-altering attacks have been previously studied in
demand-response systems [12, 16, 21, 30, 42, 50]. Demand-
response programs provide a new mechanism for control-
ling the demand of electricity to improve power grid stability
and energy efﬁciency. In their basic form, demand-response
programs provide incentives (e.g., via dynamic pricing) for
consumers to reduce electricity consumption during peak
hours. Currently, these programs are mostly used by large
commercial consumers and government agencies managing
large campuses and buildings, and their operation is based on
informal incentive signals via as phone calls by the utility or
by the demand-response provider (e.g., a company such as
Enel X) asking the consumer to lower their energy consump-
tion during the peak times. As these programs become more
widespread (targetting residential consumers) and automated
(giving utilities or demand-response companies the ability
to directly control the load of their customers remotely) the
attack surface for load altering attacks will increase.
