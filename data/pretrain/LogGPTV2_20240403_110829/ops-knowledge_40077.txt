User: I wanted to use the Python installed under cygwin rather than one installed under WinXP directly, so I edited ~/.bashrc and sourced it.  Nothing changed.  I tried other things, but nothing I did changed $PATH in any way.  So I rebooted.  Aha; now $PATH has changed to what I wanted.
But, can anyone explain WHY this happened?  When do changes to the environment (and its variables) made via cygwin (and bash) take effect only after a reboot?
(Is this any way to run a railroad?)  (This question is unlikely to win any points, but I'm curious, and I'm also tired of wading through docs which don't help on this point.)
Assistant: If you want your changes to be permanent, you should modify the proper file (.bashrc in this case) and perform ONE of the following actions:

Restart the cygwin window
source .bashrc (This should work, even if is not working for you)
. .bashrc (that is dot <space> <filename>)

However, .bashrc is used by default when using a BASH shell, so if you are using another shell (csh, ksh, zsh, etc) then your changes will not be reflected by modifying .bashrc.
