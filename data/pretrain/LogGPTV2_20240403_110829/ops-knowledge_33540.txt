User: I am submitting a job(script) to Sun Grid Engine. The job is a python program. It can take many hours to run, but it will periodically write to stdout and stderr to inform me its status (like how many iterations is finished, etc). The problem is that SGE is buffering the output and only writes to file at the end, which means that I cannot see the output on the screen or by tailing the file in real time. I can only get to know the status after the job is finished. Is there a way to get around this by configuring SGE (qsub, etc.)?
Assistant: Instead of using qsub, use qrsh.
