User: I am working on a Python App, which runs on App Engine. Is there a way I can publish the app on each customers' appSpot account, so that the App uses the users' cloud storage? Instead of running the App on my AppSpot account and all the users storing the data on my Cloud space?
Assistant: No. Writing an application that deploys other applications is in violation of the terms of service.
Note we don't have any 'hard' limits - those limits that aren't billing enabled can be increased on application to us if you provide a reasonable use-case.
