User: Is there any way to query window id by window name from python? Something that would work cross-platform perhaps (linux / mac)?
Or even better catch that id when starting a new window directly from os.sys ?
Assistant: Not on a cross-platform basis. While windows do have IDs on both Linux and Mac OS, the meaning of the IDs is quite different, as is what you can do with them. There's basically nothing in common between the two.
And no, you cannot get those IDs when you launch an application, as the window(s) aren't created until later.
