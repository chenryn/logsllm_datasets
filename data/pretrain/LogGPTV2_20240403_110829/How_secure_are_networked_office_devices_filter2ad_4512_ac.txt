Our  initial  nmap  scans  indicated  approximately  1,948 
potential candidate devices based on open ports.  The HP Web 
Jetadmin  tool  identified  1,718  devices  as  either  networked 
printers or multifunction devices; 1,443 devices were identified 
by both methods. 
At the end of our scans, we retained a list of 1,823 devices 
that could be positively identified as the type of device we were 
interested in examining. Fig. 1 shows the number of devices by 
manufacturer  (some  devices  may  be  rebranded,  however, 
usually  the  software  on  the  device  continues  to  display  the 
original  manufacturer).    While  there  are  differences  in  the 
default settings  and configurations  for  different models by the

468devices with these model numbers that could not be manually 
confirmed (due to restricted access) were judged likely to also 
support  document  server  functions.    Of  the  106  confirmed  or 
likely  devices,  13  were  not  directly  accessible  via  their  web 
interface.  Of the remaining 93 devices, 12 allowed access via 
web  interface  but  restricted  access  to  the  document  server 
feature.  The remaining 81 devices allowed public access to the 
document server feature. 
Access  to  the  document  server  feature  did  not  necessarily 
mean access to documents.   Of the 81 devices allowing access, 
40  did  not  contain  any  stored  documents.    Each  of  the 
remaining 41 devices contained at least one or more documents 
that were accessible.  Not all stored documents were accessible.  
While  access  to  the  document  server  feature  could  be 
unrestricted,  it  was  still  possible  for  access  to  individual 
documents to be restricted.  Of the 41 devices with documents 
publicly accessible, 11 contained one or more documents with 
PII or sensitive information including: 
•  SSNs with name, date of birth and current address 
• 
unexpired credit card number with CVV number 
• 
• 
• 
scanned driver’s license with picture 
scanned passport with picture 
student  ID  numbers  (which  replaced  previous  use  of 
SSNs but  are  still  considered sensitive  information by 
the university) 
In  addition  to  the  11  devices  with  PII  or  sensitive 
information,  8  others  included  documents  which  could  be 
judged to contain confidential information including: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
letters of recommendation 
interview questions and responses for candidates 
committee  reviews  of  teaching  and  research  faculty 
performance 
course evaluations which were not anonymized

  Many  printers  or 
multifunction  devices  allowed  public  access  to  print  job  logs, 
fax  logs,  and/or  address  books  (if  configured).    While  these 
logs  do  not  include  the  contents  of  documents,  the  document 
titles  and/or  phone  numbers  coupled  with  username 
information  may  leak  some  information  which  should  be 
protected.  At this time, we did not quantify the contribution of 
log  file  information  to  the  threat  of  information  disclosure  as 
we  viewed  the  presence  of  PII  and  sensitive  information  in 
stored documents as a much larger and direct contributor to the 
threat of information disclosure.

settings and configurations between manufacturers. 
Fig.  2  summarizes  some  of  the  services  listening  on  the 
devices  and  the  security  level of these  services.  Of  the  1,823 
devices found on campus, 65% had telnet service enabled. As 
Fig.  2  shows,  895  of  the  devices  (~75%)  with  telnet  enabled 
did  not  have  a  password  set  or  had  not  changed  the  default 
settings.    Almost all devices have  some  type of  web  interface 
for  administration  and  configuration.    More  than  a  third  of 
these devices did not have a password set to protect access to 
configuration settings. 
While  our  initial  scans  were  from  a  machine  directly 
connected  to  the  campus  network,  we  also  performed  some 
checks  from  off-campus.    These  checks  indicated  that  almost 
all  of  the  devices  and  services  were  accessible  from  off-
campus.

technology  security  group. 
The threat of information disclosure was deemed to be most 
critical and examined first.  We primarily focused on access to 
stored documents  on  the devices.    Information  extracted  from 
parsed  HTML combined  with  reports  from  HP  Web Jetadmin 
and  some  manual  checks  (using  a  web  browser  to  view  and 
click on control elements  of  the  web  interface  for the devices 
and attempt to view/retrieve documents) identified 106 devices 
which  were  likely  or  confirmed  to  support  functions  for 
document  storage  and  retrieval.    Not  all  devices  could  be 
confirmed because in some cases access to the web interface of 
the  device  was  restricted  or  disabled.    Access  to  stored 
documents  was  usually  only  possible  via  the  web  interface.  
However, in many of these cases, model information was still 
available using the HP Web Jetadmin tool or accessing one of 
the  other  management  interfaces  if  access  to  them  had  not  be 
restricted or disabled.  When other devices of the same model 
were  confirmed  to  support  document  server  functions,  then

469The  threat  of  privilege  elevation  (especially  from  off-
campus  attackers)  was  of  next  concern.    One  factor  affecting 
this  threat  is  access  to  the  administrative  functions  of  the 
devices.    Most  devices  include  a  web  interface  for  accessing 
the  device  and  changing  settings.    Approximately  1,805 
devices were confirmed or likely to be running web interfaces.  
As  with  the  data  collection  regarding  document  servers,  in 
some  cases  the  presence  of  a  web  interface  could  only  be 
inferred from available data, but not directly confirmed.  Of the 
confirmed  or  likely  devices, we  could  not  connect  to  the web 
interface  for  18  devices  (likely  due  to  configured  access 
restrictions).    Of  the  remaining  accessible  devices,  671  were 
not  protected  by  a  password  to  access  administrative  sections 
of  the  web  interface.    This  meant  these  devices  could 
potentially be reconfigured by an attacker.  Of the devices with 
web interfaces protected by a password, 7 were identified to be 
running  firmware  versions  susceptible  to  an  SNMP  password 
attack [26].  Such an attack would need to be performed from a 
computer  directly  connected  to  the  campus  network.    While 
many  devices  were  running  web  interfaces  not  protected  by 
passwords, the ability to extract a password by a local attacker 
(or  an  attacker  with  access  to  another  on-campus  connected 
computer)  may  be  more  valuable  to  an  attacker,  especially  if 
the same password is used to secure other devices. 
In  some  cases,  the  devices  came  configured  with  default 
passwords.  A web search can often reveal lists of devices and 
their  default  passwords.    Some  devices  even  helpfully,  but 
insecurely,  suggest  what  default  password  to  try  to  anyone 
accessing their web interface with an incorrect password. 
A  particular  configuration  of  interest  was  found  for  some 
HP devices.  For a few devices, the network access restrictions 
are  not  applied  to  the  web  interface  by  default  (an  additional 
setting must be set for the restrictions to be applied to the web 
interface).  In some cases, network access restrictions had been 
set but  not  applied  to the  web  interface and  the  web  interface 
also  did  not  have  a  password  set  to  protect  against  changes.  
Since the web interface was unprotected and not affected by the 
network access restrictions, an attacker could simply access the 
device via the web interface and remove or modify the network 
access restrictions without need for authentication. 
There  are  several  potential  factors  affecting  the  threat  of 
denial of service.  Denial of service attacks can come in many 
forms. We limited our consideration of denial of service attacks 
to the context where the service provided by the device is being 
attacked.    Print  jobs  can  be  deleted  from  the  print  queues, 
bogus  print  jobs  can  be  sent  which  would  consume  resources 
(such  as  paper  and  toner)  and  delay  or  block  legitimate  print 
requests.   Multiple rapid  requests can be  made  which  exhaust 
network resources.  Configuration changes can be made (such 
as  changing  the  IP  address  or  setting  undesirable  network 
access restrictions) which could deny legitimate users access to 
device services.  Essentially all of the devices we could identify 
were  susceptible  to  one  or  more  forms  of  denial  of  service 
attacks.    This  was  not  surprising  because  an  important 
component  of  denial  of  service  attacks  usually  involves  some 
form  of  network  access  to  the  device  and  our  methods  of 
device discovery depended on network access.  Examining the 
use  of  these  devices  in  the  context  of  being  part  of  denial  of 
service attacks against other targets was beyond our scope.

While not initially identified as a primary concern, we note 
that  many  of  the  devices  (particularly  manufactured  by  HP) 
enable the use of PJL [27] to access parts of the filesystem on 
the device.  This applies even to devices without internal hard 
drives.  If a device has sufficient RAM, a virtual drive is often 
created and can store files until the device is power-cycled.  A 
few tools [28, 29] have been created to take advantage of this 
capability and allow for files to be uploaded to the device and 
retrieved  either  by  the  tool or  via  a  web  browser  if  the  file  is 
stored  in  specific  locations.    Newer  tools  have  even  been 
released  to  create  distributed  file  systems  using  printers  with 
this  PJL  access  enabled  [30].      While  this  use  of  PJL  can 
usually  be  restricted,  the  restriction  must  often  be  set  by 
sending  a  specially  crafted  print  job  to  the  device  and  not 
through  the  usual  management  interfaces  (web,  telnet)  and 
brute-force  attacks  are  a  practical  method  for  obtaining  the 
password [30].  We did not test all devices for this capability, 
but  note  that  from  the  data  we  collected,  a  conservative
