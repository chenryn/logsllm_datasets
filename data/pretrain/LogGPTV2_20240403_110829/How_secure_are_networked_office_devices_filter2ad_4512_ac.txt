### CATEGORIES

Our initial Nmap scans identified approximately 1,948 potential candidate devices based on open ports. The HP Web Jetadmin tool further identified 1,718 of these as either networked printers or multifunction devices. Of these, 1,443 devices were identified by both methods.

At the conclusion of our scans, we compiled a list of 1,823 devices that could be positively identified as the type of device we were interested in examining. Figure 1 illustrates the number of devices by manufacturer (noting that some devices may be rebranded, but the software typically continues to display the original manufacturer). While there are variations in default settings and configurations among different models from the same manufacturer, the differences are more pronounced between different manufacturers.

### DEVICE IDENTIFICATION AND DOCUMENT ACCESS

Of the 106 confirmed or likely devices, 13 were not directly accessible via their web interface. Of the remaining 93 devices, 12 allowed access via the web interface but restricted access to the document server feature. The remaining 81 devices allowed public access to the document server feature.

Access to the document server feature did not necessarily mean access to documents. Of the 81 devices allowing access, 40 did not contain any stored documents. Each of the remaining 41 devices contained at least one or more documents that were accessible, though not all stored documents were accessible. Even with unrestricted access to the document server feature, individual documents could still be restricted.

Of the 41 devices with publicly accessible documents, 11 contained one or more documents with Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or sensitive information, including:
- Social Security Numbers (SSNs) with name, date of birth, and current address
- Unexpired credit card numbers with CVV numbers
- Scanned driverâ€™s licenses with pictures
- Scanned passports with pictures
- Student ID numbers (which replaced previous use of SSNs but are still considered sensitive information by the university)

In addition to the 11 devices with PII or sensitive information, 8 others included documents that could be judged to contain confidential information, such as:
- Letters of recommendation
- Interview questions and responses for candidates
- Committee reviews of teaching and research faculty performance
- Course evaluations that were not anonymized
- High school and college transcripts

During the study, devices were checked multiple times, and in a few cases, the number of stored documents changed. The numbers reported in this paper reflect the state of the devices at the time of their last inspection.

### INFORMATION DISCLOSURE

Many printers or multifunction devices allowed public access to print job logs, fax logs, and/or address books (if configured). While these logs do not include the contents of documents, the document titles and/or phone numbers coupled with username information may leak information that should be protected. At this time, we did not quantify the contribution of log file information to the threat of information disclosure, as we viewed the presence of PII and sensitive information in stored documents as a much larger and more direct contributor to the threat.

### SERVICE SECURITY LEVELS

Figure 2 summarizes the services listening on the devices and their security levels. Of the 1,823 devices found on campus, 65% had Telnet service enabled. As shown in Figure 2, 895 of these devices (~75%) with Telnet enabled did not have a password set or had not changed the default settings. Almost all devices have some type of web interface for administration and configuration. More than a third of these devices did not have a password set to protect access to configuration settings.

While our initial scans were conducted from a machine directly connected to the campus network, we also performed checks from off-campus. These checks indicated that almost all of the devices and services were accessible from off-campus.

### THREAT PRIORITIZATION

The ordering of threats was determined through discussions with the campus information technology security officer and is intended to reflect the priorities from the perspective of the technology security group. The identification and prioritization of threats will vary somewhat for each organization, depending on their function, assets, and liabilities. Other organizations may assign different priorities to the same threats and may choose to include and examine risks from other threat possibilities.

### PRIVILEGE ELEVATION

The threat of privilege elevation, especially from off-campus attackers, was of next concern. One factor affecting this threat is access to the administrative functions of the devices. Most devices include a web interface for accessing the device and changing settings. Approximately 1,805 devices were confirmed or likely to be running web interfaces. In some cases, the presence of a web interface could only be inferred from available data but not directly confirmed. Of the confirmed or likely devices, we could not connect to the web interface for 18 devices (likely due to configured access restrictions). Of the remaining accessible devices, 671 were not protected by a password to access administrative sections of the web interface, making them potentially reconfigurable by an attacker. Of the devices with web interfaces protected by a password, 7 were identified to be running firmware versions susceptible to an SNMP password attack [26]. Such an attack would need to be performed from a computer directly connected to the campus network. While many devices were running web interfaces not protected by passwords, the ability to extract a password by a local attacker (or an attacker with access to another on-campus connected computer) may be more valuable, especially if the same password is used to secure other devices.

### DEFAULT PASSWORDS

In some cases, the devices came configured with default passwords. A web search can often reveal lists of devices and their default passwords. Some devices even suggest what default password to try to anyone accessing their web interface with an incorrect password, which is insecure.

### HP DEVICE CONFIGURATION

A particular configuration of interest was found for some HP devices. For a few devices, the network access restrictions are not applied to the web interface by default (an additional setting must be set for the restrictions to be applied to the web interface). In some cases, network access restrictions had been set but not applied to the web interface, and the web interface also did not have a password set to protect against changes. Since the web interface was unprotected and not affected by the network access restrictions, an attacker could simply access the device via the web interface and remove or modify the network access restrictions without needing authentication.

### DENIAL OF SERVICE

There are several potential factors affecting the threat of denial of service. Denial of service attacks can come in many forms. We limited our consideration of denial of service attacks to the context where the service provided by the device is being attacked. Print jobs can be deleted from the print queues, bogus print jobs can be sent which would consume resources (such as paper and toner) and delay or block legitimate print requests. Multiple rapid requests can exhaust network resources. Configuration changes can be made (such as changing the IP address or setting undesirable network access restrictions), which could deny legitimate users access to device services. Essentially all of the devices we could identify were susceptible to one or more forms of denial of service attacks. This was not surprising because an important component of denial of service attacks usually involves some form of network access to the device, and our methods of device discovery depended on network access. Examining the use of these devices in the context of being part of denial of service attacks against other targets was beyond our scope.

### RISK CATEGORIES

| Risk | Description |
|------|-------------|
| High | Documents with PII or sensitive information publicly available |
| Medium | Web interface not secured and/or running vulnerable firmware and/or document server feature publicly accessible |
| Low | At least web interface protected and/or some network access controls in place which apply to web interface access |

### NUMBER OF DEVICES BY RISK

| Risk | Number of Devices |
|------|-------------------|
| High | 19 |
| Medium | 684 |
| Low | 1,120 |

### PJL ACCESS

While not initially identified as a primary concern, we note that many of the devices (particularly those manufactured by HP) enable the use of Printer Job Language (PJL) to access parts of the filesystem on the device. This applies even to devices without internal hard drives. If a device has sufficient RAM, a virtual drive is often created and can store files until the device is power-cycled. A few tools [28, 29] have been created to take advantage of this capability, allowing files to be uploaded to the device and retrieved either by the tool or via a web browser if the file is stored in specific locations. Newer tools have even been released to create distributed file systems using printers with PJL access enabled [30]. While this use of PJL can usually be restricted, the restriction must often be set by sending a specially crafted print job to the device and not through the usual management interfaces (web, Telnet), and brute-force attacks are a practical method for obtaining the password [30]. We did not test all devices for this capability, but note that from the data we collected, a conservative estimate suggests that many devices are vulnerable to this type of access.
