### Analysis of Application-Layer Request Arrivals and Server Performance

#### Diurnal Patterns and Growth Trends

**Figure 4: Hourly Application-Layer Request Arrivals**

- **Applications Analyzed**: Hugged, Holiday Cheers, and The Streets
- **Observations**:
  - All three applications exhibit a diurnal pattern in request arrivals.
  - The request arrival rate and its evolution over time vary significantly based on the popularity and seasonal nature of the applications.
  - **Hugged**: Represents an extremely popular application with a mature user base.
  - **Holiday Cheers**: A recently launched, seasonal application (e.g., during Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year) that experienced viral growth.
  - **The Streets**: A gaming application with lower popularity compared to Holiday Cheers.

**Figure 5: Installation Requests vs. Requests from Authorized Users**

- **Correlation**: There is a high correlation coefficient between installation requests and requests from authorized users, suggesting a preferential attachment process.
- **Implications**: Increased usage of social network applications attracts more users, leading to higher server loads during busy periods.

#### Server Load and Processing Delays

**Figure 6: Distribution of Application Server Processing Delay**

- **Hugged**: Larger processing delay (\(d_p\)) due to its larger and more mature user base.
- **Holiday Cheers and The Streets**: Smaller \(d_p\) compared to Hugged.

**Key Findings**:

1. **Server Loads and Inter-Arrival Times**:
   - **Inter-Arrival Time**: For Hugged, the inter-arrival time follows an exponential distribution with a mean of 0.4 seconds.
   - **Load Correlation**: Processing delays (\(d_p\)) correlate positively with server loads, while queuing delays (\(d_q\)) are negligible (less than 20ms on average).

2. **Impact of Resource Provisioning**:
   - **Hugged**: Current provisioning seems adequate, but increased popularity may require more resources.
   - **Holiday Cheers**: Initial increase in \(d_p\) during the first week after launch. After a server upgrade (from 4GB to 8GB shared memory), \(d_p\) stabilized despite continued growth.

**Figures 7 and 8: Variation of \(d_p\) with Load**

- **Hugged**: \(d_p\) shows a positive correlation with load and a diurnal pattern.
- **Holiday Cheers**: \(d_p\) initially increased with the user base but stabilized after the server upgrade.

#### Request Response Sizes

- **Stability**: Response sizes remain stable over time, independent of server load.
- **Data Extraction**: Response sizes are extracted from TCP dump logs, including timestamps and source IP/ports.
- **Mature Applications**: Expected to have larger response sizes due to a larger user base and more application-related data (e.g., activity history).

**Conclusion**:
- The analysis provides insights into the patterns and performance of top Facebook applications, highlighting the importance of resource provisioning and the impact of user behavior on server loads and processing delays.
