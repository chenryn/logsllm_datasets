### Issue Summary

**Database:** DB2  
**Symfony Version:** 2.2

**Problem Description:**
The application is encountering an "undefined index ancestor_id" error in the `aclProvider.php` class. The issue arises because the dynamic SQL statement references the column as "ANCESTOR_ID," while in the `aclProvider.php` file, it is defined as "ancestor_id."

**Steps to Resolve:**
1. **Identify the SQL Statement:**
   Locate the dynamic SQL statement that includes the "ANCESTOR_ID" column.

2. **Update the Column Name:**
   Change the column name in the SQL statement from "ANCESTOR_ID" to "ancestor_id" to match the definition in `aclProvider.php`.

3. **Test the Application:**
   After making the change, test the application to ensure the issue is resolved and there are no other related errors.
