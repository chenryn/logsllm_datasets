I am curious if TypeScript plans to introduce a conditional member access operator, similar to the `?.` operator in C#. 

Currently, we need to write:
```typescript
foo && foo.bar && foo.bar.baz();
```

It would be more concise and readable if we could write:
```typescript
foo?.bar?.baz();
```

Is this feature already available in TypeScript, or is it being considered for future releases?
