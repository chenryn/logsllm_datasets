**Is this a BUG REPORT or FEATURE REQUEST?** (Choose one):

- **Kubernetes version** (use `kubectl version`): v1.3.7
- **Environment**:
  - **Cloud provider or hardware configuration**: 
  - **OS** (e.g., from `/etc/os-release`): CentOS 7
  - **Kernel** (e.g., `uname -a`): `Linux zhouzong-1-e426f249-e94c-439d-a300-ae836e93dada 3.10.0-327.el7.x86_64 #1 SMP Thu Nov 19 22:10:57 UTC 2015 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux`
  - **Install tools**: 
  - **Others**: 

**What happened?**  
1. After running the command: `/home/cmcc/k8s_1.3.7/cluster/images/hyperkube/make build VERSION=v1.3.7`, the following error occurred:
   ```
   cp ../../../_output/dockerized/bin/linux/amd64/hyperkube /tmp/tmp.HzRR8SYT3E
   cp: cannot stat ‘../../../_output/dockerized/bin/linux/amd64/hyperkube’: No such file or directory
   make: *** [build] Error 1
   ```

2. According to the README, the first step is to build the binaries using: `$ build/run.sh hack/build-cross.sh`. However, when attempting to run these commands, the following errors were encountered:
   ```
   build/run.sh: No such file or directory
   hack/build-cross.sh: No such file or directory
   ```

**What you expected to happen:**  
The necessary files for building the images should be included and packaged together. We suggest that this be done as part of the initial setup.

**How to reproduce it** (as minimally and precisely as possible):  
This issue occurs consistently when trying to build the hyperkube image.

**Anything else we need to know:**
