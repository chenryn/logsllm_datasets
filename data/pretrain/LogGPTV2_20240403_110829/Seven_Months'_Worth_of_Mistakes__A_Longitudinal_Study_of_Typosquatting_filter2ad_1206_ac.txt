To investigate to what degree typosquatters and legitimate
domain owners are aware of the different models that can
be used to generate typosquatting domains, we calculated the
Fig. 4. The typosquatting saturation per typosquatting model. Although the
substitution model has the most domains in absolute numbers, it is the least
popular taking into account the number of domains generated by each model.
number of registered domains for each of the ﬁve models
described in Section II-A. Our data indicates there are 6,399
malicious and 376 defensive registrations for domains gener-
ated by the character substitution model, making it the most
popular model in absolute numbers. This is to be expected
however, because the character substitution model generates
much more typosquatting domains for a given authoritative
domain than any other model. Conversely, the missing dot
model only generates a single possible typosquatting domain
per authoritative domain. To accurately compare the popularity
of the different typosquatting models, we should hence look at
the active fraction of all possible typosquatting domains, per
typosquatting model. That is, out of all typosquatting domains
generated according to some model (starting from our list of
authoritative domains), we look at how many of them are active
(i.e., resolve to a web page). We call this relative measure
the typosquatting saturation per typosquatting model. Fig. 4
shows the typosquatting saturation for each of the ﬁve models
we consider, differentiating between defensive and malicious
registrations. We can see that, by this measure, the character
substitution model is actually the least popular model, i.e., out
of all possible typosquatting domains generated by this model,
less than 40% are in use. The ﬁgure shows that the missing
dot model is the most popular model, for defensive as well as
for malicious registrations. Our data indicates no signiﬁcant
change in the popularity of the different models over time.
Note that if we would rank the ﬁve models based on
their corresponding typosquatting saturation, we get the same
ranking whether we consider malicious or defensive registra-
tions. This suggests that attackers and defenders have a similar
perception of what typosquatting domains are worthwhile to
register.
E. Inﬂuence of Domain Name Length
Since four of the ﬁve typosquatting models we consider
can be applied for each character in a domain name, the
number of possible typosquatting domains for a given au-
thoritative domain increases linearly with the length of the
authoritative domain. Previous work published by Banerjee
et al. [2] indicated that the active number of typosquatting
domains for a given authoritative domain does not follow this
relation: shorter domains were targeted much more frequently
than longer domains. Our data shows that this is no longer the

case, as illustrated by Fig. 5. The solid black bars in this ﬁgure
show the average typosquatting saturation per authoritative
domain name length when taking all ﬁve typosquatting models
into account. That is,
the Y-axis shows the percentage of
all possible typosquatting domains of authoritative domains
of a certain length that are active (i.e., resolve to an IP
address hosting a website). As mentioned in Section III-D,
the typosquatting saturation is an averaging over time and in
this case takes into account the fact that longer authoritative
domains have more possible typosquatting domains. Although
the solid bars show a decrease in typosquatting saturation as
the authoritative domain length increases, this decrease is not
nearly as outspoken as in the results of Banerjee et al. in
2008 [2], where the typosquatting saturation quickly drops to
under 20% for domains longer than 5 characters.
Furthermore, since the number of possible typosquatting
domains following the character substitution model rises very
quickly as the domain length increases, and the previous
section has shown that this is the least popular typosquat-
ting model, we can automatically expect the typosquatting
saturation to drop with increasing domain length. To remove
this bias, the crossed-out bars in Fig. 5 discard the character
substitution model. Here we can see even more clearly that
there is no correlation between typosquatting saturation and
authoritative domain length for the domains we investigated.
These results indicate that typosquatters have started target-
ing longer authoritative domains in the past six years. The most
likely reason for this is that most short typosquatting domains
were already in use: the ﬁgure illustrates that the average
typosquatting saturation for domain names up to 8 characters
is over 75%. A large fraction of the possible typosquatting
domains of relatively short, popular websites is hence already
registered.
F.
Inﬂuence of Alexa Rank
Since typosquatters are trying to get as many page hits as
possible, more popular authoritative domains are presumably
targeted more often than less popular domains. Fig. 6 shows
a box-and-whisker plot indicating the typosquatting saturation
per Alexa rank. The ends of the whiskers show the minimum
and maximum typosquatting saturation, the box shows the
upper and lower quartiles and the line within the box shows
the median typosquatting saturation. The plot indicates that
the saturation within each rank bin varies widely and shows
no signiﬁcant correlation between rank and saturation. This
contradicts the ’08 results of Banerjee et al. [2], which in-
dicated that the percentage of active typosquatting domains
for a given authoritative domain reduces signiﬁcantly with
decreasing popularity, reaching only about 20% for the domain
ranking 500 in their list of authoritative domains. Our results
hence indicate typosquatters have started focusing on lower
ranking domains in the past six years,
in addition to the
top ranking domains. These results are consistent with the
recent ﬁndings of Szurdi et al. [23], who investigated the
typosquatting activity for all .com domains in the Alexa
top 1 million. Their study indicates that, although there is
a positive correlation between typosquatting saturation and
authoritative domain popularity, the typosquatting saturation
is still at 40% near the Alexa 1 million rank.
To further investigate the inﬂuence of authoritative domain
popularity on typosquatting activity, we investigated whether
there is a correlation between the change in Alexa rank of an
authoritative domain over our data gathering period, and the
change in number of active malicious typosquatting domains
of that authoritative domain. We did this by comparing the
authoritative domain ranks and the number of active malicious
typosquatting domains during the ﬁrst week our data gathering
period with the same ﬁgures during the last week of data
gathering period, but we found no signiﬁcant correlation.
G. Typosquatting Domain Volatility
One of the main objectives of our longitudinal study is
to evaluate the volatility of the ﬁeld of typosquatting. In
particular, we would like to see (1) whether domains are
changing hands from typosquatters to legitimate owners and
(2) whether typosquatters vary the type of content they host
on their domains. For this, we look at the number of category
transitions per domain. To avoid overestimating the number of
transitions, we assume that the content hosted on a domain
does not change when we see a transition from a legitimate
or malicious category to an undetermined category. That is,
suppose a domain is in a legitimate or malicious category C
at date x and is in an undetermined category at date x+1, then
we still consider the domain to be in category C at date x + 1.
We used this methodology to generate the graph in Fig. 7,
which hence gives a lower bound on the number of category
transitions per domain over time.

moving from typosquatters to legitimate owners and vice versa, and are often
changing category while being malicious.
Fig. 8. Frequency distribution of the number of malicious category transitions
per domain. Note that the Y-axis has a logarithmic scale.
The two bottom lines of this ﬁgure refer to the left-
hand Y-scale and show the total number of malicious to
legitimate or legitimate to malicious transitions. During our
study, we saw an average of about 3 malicious-to-legitimate,
and about 2 legitimate-to-malicious transitions per week.
These numbers indicate legitimate owners are taking over
domains from typosquatters and vice versa, albeit not in great
numbers. With the exception of one domain, all domains
that moved from malicious to legitimate stayed legitimate
until the end of the data gathering period, and likewise for
the legitimate to malicious transitions. The one exception
is os.com, a domain being leased by lexidot.com and
which transitioned from the “Coinciding” category to the
“For sale” category and back, twice during the data gathering
period. Some examples of malicious to legitimate transitions
are tumblr.com taking over timblr.com, umblr.com
and six other
typosquatting domains. Some examples of
transitions in the other direction are livedoor.com los-
ing livedooor.com and bleacherreport.com losing
bleachereport.com. For some of these legitimate to
malicious transitions, the WHOIS records clearly indicate a
change of hands, while for others the records are incomplete or
simply do not change, which could indicate that those domains
were already owned by typosquatters but were not being used
for malicious purposes initially.
The upper line of Fig. 7 uses the right-hand Y-scale and
shows the number of malicious category transitions, e.g., a
transition from the “Ad Parking” category to the “Afﬁliate

abuse” category. With an average of 1,239 transitions per
week, we can see that these kinds of transitions occur much
more frequently than legit-malicious transitions. If we average
the total number of category transitions over the number of
discovered typosquatting domains, we get a value of 2.84
transitions per domain over the seven month data gathering
period. This means that, on average, a typosquatting domain
serves pages from the same category for about 75 days in
a row. However, in practice most domains did not change
category at all during the data gathering period, while some
changed very often. The bar chart in Fig. 8 shows the frequency
distribution of the number of malicious category transitions per
domain. The data indicates that 8,521 domains, representing
65% of all malicious typosquatting domains, stayed in the
same category for the entire duration of the study, and 95%
of all malicious typosquatting domains made less than 20
category changes. Nevertheless, there are some domains that
switch malicious categories up to 79 times.
By manual inspection, we saw some typosquatting domains
redirect to a different landing page on a regular basis, some-
times even on every visit. We posit that the domains operating
in this fashion can be subdivided into two types. The ﬁrst type
of domains shows different categories of landing pages, often
switching between ad parking, afﬁliate abuse and scamming
pages. Typosquatters most likely use this scheme to diversify
their monetization strategy, possibly even switching to the most
proﬁtable strategy dynamically. An example of a typosquatting
domain of this type is yuotube.com, a domain that, at the
time of writing, switches between pages classiﬁed under the
ad parking, afﬁliate abuse and scam categories on every visit.
The other type of domains shows many different pages over
time, but all within the general hit stealing category. These
domains are owned by the rogue Internet marketing company
for drawing trafﬁc to the sites of its customers, as discussed
in Section III-C.
H. IP Address Statistics
In the previous section we found some typosquatting do-
mains to be very volatile, i.e., changing typosquatting cate-
gories many times during the data gathering period. To see
whether the IP address these domains resolve to also changes
regularly, we investigated the number of distinct IP addresses
and subnets associated with each typosquatting domain over
time. Fig. 9 shows the cumulative density function of the num-
ber of distinct /24 subnets per domain, for both the legitimate
domains and the malicious domains. We considered a domain

to be legitimate when it is classiﬁed as such for at least 90% of
the data gathering period, and we again considered a domain
to be malicious when it is classiﬁed as malicious for at least
7 days. We only take into account the 24 most signiﬁcant bits
of an IP address to group together addresses that are close to
each other, for instance belonging to servers in the same data
center. Changing the subnet mask by a couple of bits has no
signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the graph. We can see from the graph
