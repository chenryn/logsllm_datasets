### 5.99 Analysis of DNS/UDP Fragmented Responses

Next, we analyze the number of DNS/UDP fragmented responses per authoritative server and IP version. Figure 2 illustrates a time series of these responses. We observe that the number of fragmented responses is very low, fewer than 10,000 per day, compared to a total of 2.2 billion responses per day. Notably, NS1 had no fragmented responses in 2020, likely due to a reduction in response sizes (Table 2).

**Figure 2: UDP Fragmented Queries for .nl Authoritative Servers**

Despite the low occurrence of fragmented queries, it is important to understand why they occur. Most fragmented queries originate from NS3 (Figure 2), as NS3 does not return minimal responses (Section 3.1), which inflates the response sizes.

However, resolvers also play a role. We isolated the DNS/UDP fragmented responses and analyzed the announced EDNS0 buffer sizes. Figure 3 shows the results for July 2020, for both IPv4 and IPv6. Most fragmented queries are smaller than 2048 bytes, but the majority of these resolvers announced a large EDNS0 buffer size, typically 4096 bytes, which is the default value in BIND (up to version 9.16.6) [24]. While our vantage point does not allow us to determine if clients experience fragmentation, it indicates that authoritative servers rarely fragment responses.

**Figure 3: Fragmented Queries in July 2020: Response Sizes and EDNS0 Buffer Sizes**

### Packets Larger Than Path MTU

Since we collect traffic only at the authoritative servers, we cannot directly determine if there was IPv4 fragmentation along the path. However, we can use the ICMP protocol to check if some DNS responses exceed the path MTU.

Routers along the path handle IP packets larger than their MTU using ICMP. For IPv4 packets with the "Don't Fragment" (DF) flag set, the router discards the packet and sends an ICMP Type 3, code 4 packet ("Fragmentation Needed and Don’t Fragment was Set") back to the authoritative server. If the DF flag is off, the router can fragment the packet without sending an ICMP message. IPv6 packets cannot be fragmented by routers, and routers send an ICMPv6 Type 2 message ("Packet Too Big") back to the authoritative server [26].

In our setup, only the DNS provider of NS3 provides us with ICMP traffic. Table 3 shows the distribution of ICMP error messages associated with large packets, indicating that there are very few ICMP packets.

**Table 3: Distribution of ICMP Error Messages Associated with Large Packets**

In the worst-case scenario, large DNS/UDP packets could be discarded by routers, leading to unreachability. However, previous research has shown that DNS resolvers have built-in fail-tolerance features and will retry multiple times or switch to different servers or IP versions to obtain responses [33,35]. Having multiple authoritative servers on dissimilar networks minimizes the probability of unreachability.

### Network Issues with Large Responses

Our vantage point does not allow us to determine if clients receive large DNS/UDP responses. To address this, we used Ripe Atlas probes and NS3 to evaluate 1 million queries from approximately 8,500 probes over one day. Section A.1 shows that 2.5% of small (221 bytes) DNS/UDP responses time out, while 6.9% of large (1744 bytes) responses time out, considering a single DNS/UDP query without TCP fallback. This suggests that network issues are more likely to cause fragmentation than server-side fragmentation. Similar findings were reported by Huston [22] and Van den Broek et al. [51], who found that up to 10% of resolvers might be unable to handle fragments.

### 3.3 DNS Truncation: How and When?

Table 1 shows that 2.93–7.15% of all evaluated queries were truncated. We investigate the reasons for this. For each truncated response, we fetch its response size and the respective query's EDNS0 buffer size. Figure 4 shows the CDF for these values for July 2020, for NS1 (Section A shows NS3 for 2020 and the 2019 results for NS1 and NS3). Most DNS/UDP responses are truncated to values under 512 bytes, regardless of the IP version.

**Figure 4: NS1: CDF of DNS/UDP TC Responses for .nl in July 2020**

Small or no EDNS0 values lead to truncation: most EDNS buffer sizes are 512 bytes, which is too small for many queries. Increasing the advertised buffer size would reduce truncated responses. Interestingly, NS1 receives 13% of queries with no EDNS0 extension, unlike other servers or IP versions (shown as EDNS0=1 in Figure 4). This is due to an anomaly from two ASes (AS2637 – Georgia Tech and AS61207 – Ilait AB), whose resolvers have a "sticky" behavior, sending queries only to NS1 over IPv4 and mostly without EDNS0 UDP buffer values.

Large EDNS0 values do not guarantee against truncation: even with large EDNS0 buffers, clients still receive truncated responses. Although 4096 bytes is sufficient for most responses, the authoritative server may truncate based on its local MTU or max-udp-size.

### 3.4 Do Resolvers Fall Back to TCP?

Upon receiving a DNS/UDP truncated response, DNS resolvers should resend the query over TCP, known as TCP fallback [10]. In July 2020 (Table 1), 7.15% of DNS/UDP TC queries were over IPv6, but only 5.37% of TCP queries over IPv6, suggesting 1.78% were not followed by DNS/TCP queries. We investigate this further.

Figure 5 shows how many UDP responses with the TC flag are followed by a TCP query within 60 seconds from the same IP address. In July 2020, 80% of IPv4 and 75% of IPv6 replies were retried via TCP within this timeframe (median). For zones with responses often larger than 1232 bytes, this means an increase in TCP connections after the Flag Day.

**Figure 5: TC Replies with TCP Retries**

If a resolver retries a query via TCP, it is usually sent within less than 100 ms. Figure 6 shows the time between the name server receiving the initial UDP query and the TCP retry on July 1, 2020. 80% of all retries are sent within 100 ms, and 90% within 1 second. Retries from IPv6 addresses reach our authoritative servers slightly faster.

**Figure 6: Time Until First TCP Fallback**

### Missing TCP Queries

There are several reasons why truncated queries may not be followed by TCP ones. For example, queries from non-resolvers such as crawlers or malware, or data missing from NS2, the other anycast authoritative server for .nl. Resolver farms may also be partially responsible, as the TCP query may be sent from adjacent IP addresses. Dual-stacked resolvers may only send a TCP query over the first IP version response arriving. We estimate that we miss up to 4.8% of retries in our initial measurement.

This still leaves 15–21% of TC replies without a TCP retry. For July 1, 2020, 47% of these queries without TCP retries were from Google (AS15169), a well-known large public resolver operator [16] with a complex, multi-layered resolver architecture. Given their infrastructure, Google could use a different resolver to send the TCP fallback query. Extending our query matching criteria, we find that Google resolvers almost always fallback to TCP, with 99% of UDP TC queries being followed by a TCP query.

### 4. Resolver EDNS0 Buffer Sizes

We analyze the EDNS0 buffer sizes for all resolvers in our datasets (Table 1). For 2020, Figure 7a shows that roughly 30% of all resolvers announce 512 bytes or less, and 48.86% announce 1232 bytes or less. The majority announce 4096 bytes (33%). For ASes, 20% announce 512 bytes or less, and 71% announce up to 1232 bytes or less. Overall, most resolvers announce a 4096-byte ENDS0 buffer size, which is the BIND9 default value up to version 9.16.7, contributing to DNS/UDP fragmentation.

**Figure 7a: EDNS0 Buffer Sizes per Resolver and Values: July 2020**

Figure 7b shows the number of unique EDNS0 buffer sizes announced per resolver for July 2020. More than 60% of resolvers announce only one EDNS0 value over the period. Only 5% of resolvers show three or more EDNS0 values, possibly due to dynamic ENDS values [24] or configuration changes. Finally, 7% of resolvers (not shown in the figure) have no EDNS0 support, likely from old, non-compliant clients.

### 4.1 DNS Flag Day 2020: Uptake

The DNS Flag Day 2020 aimed to avoid IP fragmentation on DNS/UDP by disallowing UDP queries larger than 1232 bytes. This value was chosen based on a minimum MTU of 1280 bytes for IPv6 [9] minus 48 bytes of IPv6/UDP headers. The proposed date (October 1, 2020) suggested operators change their authoritative DNS servers and resolvers.

To determine the Flag Day uptake, we compare the EDNS0 values from resolvers in July 2020 to October 2020 (Table 1). Table 4a summarizes this data, showing 1.85 million resolvers active in both datasets, sending 117.5 billion queries in the period.

**Table 4: DNS Flag Day Datasets and Changing Resolvers**

| **Resolvers** | **July 2020** | **October 2020** | **Intersection** |
|---------------|---------------|------------------|------------------|
| Total         | 3.78M         | 3.84M            | 1.85M            |
| UDP Queries   | 60.3B         | 62.81B           | 117.54B          |

**Table 4a: Before and After Datasets**

**Table 4b: EDNS0 1232 Resolvers**

| **Resolvers** | **from 4096 bytes** | **from 1680 bytes** | **from 512 bytes** | **Rest** | **Total** |
|---------------|---------------------|---------------------|--------------------|----------|-----------|
| Count         | 11338               | 7881                | 1807               | 1252     | 398       |
| ASes          | 958                 |                     |                    |          |           |
| Queries       | 3.01B               |                     |                    |          |           |

Figure 8 shows the CDF of resolvers' EDNS0 buffer sizes. There are minimal changes in resolver EDNS behavior. In July 2020, 14.6% of resolvers used EDNS0 buffers of 1232 bytes or less, increasing to 16.0% in October 2020. The most popular EDNS0 buffer value remains 4096 bytes, with about 53% of resolvers using it.

**Figure 8: CDF of Resolvers' EDNS0 Buffer Sizes**

We identified 11,338 resolvers that changed their EDNS0 value to 1232 bytes, responsible for 3.01 billion queries out of 117.54 billion. These resolvers belonged to 958 different ASes, with most (6240) belonging to two ASes in Taiwan and Poland.

**Looking Back 1.5 Years:**
The Flag Day 2020 was originally proposed in October 2019. Some operators may have deployed it before the chosen date. We analyzed the proportion of resolvers over 1.5 years (May 2019-December 2020). Figure 9 shows the percentage of unique IP addresses announcing different buffer sizes per day. Despite an increase in resolvers using EDNS0 1232, they accounted for only 4.4% of the total resolvers by October 2020. The number of 4096-byte resolvers reduced from 50% to 40%. Since November 2020, the number of resolvers announcing 1232 bytes has grown, reaching 6.5% by the end of December 2020. These results indicate that a large population of resolvers still needs to be reconfigured to use EDNS0 1232 bytes.

### 5. Related Work

IP fragmentation is well-known to have issues with middleboxes like NAT devices and stateless firewalls, leading to unreachability and security vulnerabilities [5, 14, 17, 50, 57]. It has been used in DNS cache poisoning attacks and to compromise CAs. Given these problems, IP fragmentation is considered fragile and should be avoided in DNS [5, 12, 58].
