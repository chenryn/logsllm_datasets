The follow case where link buttons and input type=submit (or type=button)
result in btn-group's not aligning within the btn-toolbar in all major
browsers.

My work around was to set chained .btn-group to margin-bottom the same value
as .btn-toolbar, which isn't getting picked up by any chained .btn-group's.
Here's the css override:
.btn-group + .btn-group {  
margin-bottom: 9px;  
}
Here's the original bootstrap 2.0 css:
.btn-group + .btn-group {  
margin-left: 5px;  
}
.btn-toolbar {  
margin-top: 9px;  
margin-bottom: 9px;  
}
