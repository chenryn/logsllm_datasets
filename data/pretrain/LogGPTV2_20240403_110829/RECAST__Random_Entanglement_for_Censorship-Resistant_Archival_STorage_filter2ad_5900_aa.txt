## Abstract
Users are increasingly relying on online cloud systems for long-term data archiving. However, existing storage systems designed to preserve user data unaltered for decades often lack strong security guarantees, especially at a reasonable cost. This paper introduces RECAST, an anti-censorship data archival system that leverages random data entanglement. Documents are mixed using an entanglement scheme that employs erasure codes to ensure secure and tamper-proof long-term archival. The entanglement is such that deleting a specific document stored in the system for a significant period becomes virtually impossible without also erasing a substantial fraction of the entire archive, thus requiring a very powerful adversary and exposing the attack. We validate RECAST's entanglement approach through simulations and present a full-fledged prototype deployed in a local cluster. In one of our settings, we demonstrate that RECAST, configured with the same storage overhead as triple replication, can withstand 10% of storage node failures without any data loss. Additionally, we estimate that the effort required for a powerful censor to delete a specific target document is two orders of magnitude greater than that for triple replication.

## 1. Introduction
Users are entrusting an increasing number of documents to online cloud systems for long-term archival purposes. For these archives, users expect their content to remain available and readily accessible at all times, making durability a critical requirement. Threats to durability can be broadly categorized into passive threats (e.g., hardware failures) and active threats (e.g., a censor attempting to delete a specific document). Redundancy is a common countermeasure against passive threats, but defending against active attacks remains a challenge. Various solutions have been proposed, but none are fully satisfactory. For example, security by obscurity encrypts content before archival, but this limits data operations and accessibility. Data entanglement weaves together popular and unpopular data, forcing an attacker to cause collateral damage, but it is not practical for real-world deployment.

RECAST is an anti-censorship data archival system based on a random data entanglement strategy. It provides strong guarantees while being applicable to real systems. By entangling pieces of data, RECAST enables unpopular and rarely accessed content to benefit from the protection offered to other data. The asymmetry of the construction makes the system easy to repair and hard to corrupt. The randomness in RECAST's entanglement makes it NP-hard to compute the minimal set of documents to delete to censor a target, while error-correcting codes allow for recursive system repair without increasing storage overhead.

To assess the security of RECAST, we assume a powerful adversary model where the censor has access to metadata and knows how documents are processed, split, and distributed. RECAST includes an emergency disaster recovery mechanism to rebuild metadata from the data itself. We measure the protection by the number of additional documents a censor must delete when targeting a specific document. RECAST offers both strong long-term and fast short-term protection by combining uniform data entanglement, which provides strong long-term protection, with normal data entanglement and temporary replication, which provide fast short-term protection.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section II outlines our design goals, Section III surveys related work, Section IV describes the entanglement and STEP-archival strategy, Section V introduces nu-entanglement, and Sections VI and VII discuss the design and implementation details of the RECAST prototype. Section VIII evaluates security and performance, and Section IX concludes with a discussion of extensions and future work.

## 2. Design Goals
Our goal is to design a long-term censorship-resistant system ensuring content integrity and durability. Durability, defined as the ability to eventually retrieve any archived document, is paramount. While high availability and confidentiality are desirable, they can become expensive and expose the system to risks over time. RECAST ensures durability by establishing random document interdependency links, enabling recursive reconstruction of data beyond the local capability of the underlying erasure code. The tradeoff is that documents cannot be updated or deleted from the archive. A file update requires a new file upload, and file removal is not supported to prevent censors from easily deleting content.

## 3. Related Work
Anti-censorship for digital data has been explored in various studies, including [7] and [3, 8, 9, 1, 4, 2]. Three main approaches are: (i) replication to protect against a censor compromising a small number of servers, (ii) anonymity to hide the user's identity and/or the content's location, and (iii) entanglement to prevent an attacker from deleting a single target document without causing collateral damage.

Most systems offer tamper detection, but data reconstruction is less commonly supported. RECAST, however, offers a powerful recursive data reconstruction method. Table I summarizes the features of several censorship-resistant systems, including DAGSTER, TANGLER, FREENET, FREEHAVEN, and RECAST.

### 3.1 DAGSTER
DAGSTER is a censorship-resistant publishing system that uses an anonymous channel between data publishers/consumers and servers. Each b-bits block of the original document is stored encrypted and XORed with c old blocks from the pool of archived blocks. RECAST offers a wider choice of coding parameters, enabling greater fault tolerance.

### 3.2 TANGLER
TANGLER allows users to publish documents anonymously using a naming convention and public/private key pair. Each document block is entangled with exactly 2 old blocks using (3,4)-Shamir secret sharing. RECAST provides a more flexible scheme where the number of blocks required to retrieve a document depends on the configuration of the entanglement code.

### 3.3 FREENET
FREENET is an anonymizing and censorship-resistant distributed storage system. Nodes know only their neighbors in the chain of queries, ensuring file anonymity. However, FREENET lacks permanent storage guarantees, as the least recently used files are deleted when the datastore exceeds its designated size. RECAST, in contrast, is designed to store documents indefinitely, making it prohibitively difficult to delete a single document.

### 3.4 FREEHAVEN
FREEHAVEN is an anonymous publishing system that allows users to associate an expiration time with documents.
