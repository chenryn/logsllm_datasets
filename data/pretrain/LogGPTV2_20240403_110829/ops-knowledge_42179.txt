User: Macs return a Posixpath when the user enters a path. Windows returns a WindowsPath object when the user does the same thing. Is there a way for me to check whether the input is valid depending on the machine?
Assistant: Actually, unless you are using the new pathlib, the thing  returned in both cases is just a str.
Also, NT accepts / as a path delimeter and to posix \ is just another character.
So -- no, you can't tell, at least not without trying to use the path; and that will only tell you if something is wrong, not if something can work.
