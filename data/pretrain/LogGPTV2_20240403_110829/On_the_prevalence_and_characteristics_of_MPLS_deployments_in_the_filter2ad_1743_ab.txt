inition of tunnel is any consecutive series of label-switched routers
within the same autonomous system3. As described in Section 2,
we can identify LSRs by the presence of MPLS extension informa-
tion in an ICMP time exceeded message from a router. Note that
with this deﬁnition, the length of a tunnel refers only to the inner-
most label switched path (i.e., the length of the tunnel identiﬁed by
the sequence of labels at the bottom of the label stack) and does not
consider nested LSPs. (We comment on nested tunnels and nested
tunnel lengths below.) Note also that within an AS, we may see
some number of layer 3 (IP) hops before entering a tunnel. We

we discuss below.
The data that we use are collected as part of the Archipelago
(Ark) project, and include traceroute measurements to all
routed /24 preﬁxes in the IPv4 Internet, initiated from a set of
widely distributed probing hosts. The probing tool used in Ark
is Scamper [26], and the speciﬁc traceroute method used is
ICMP Paris [28]. The Ark project was initiated in 2007, and data
are available starting from September of that year. However, the
version of Scamper used at that time did not support the ICMP ex-
tensions for MPLS. Support for those extensions was introduced
into Scamper in early 2008, and a version of Scamper with support
for ICMP extensions for MPLS was rolled out to Ark in mid-May
of 20084 [21, 27]. For that reason, we restrict our analysis in this
section to the Ark data from June 2008 to August 2011. Lastly,
rather than analyzing all the available Ark data from June 2008 on-
ward, we selected the ﬁrst full set of data available for each month
resulting a corpus of over 250M individual traceroute measure-
ments. Investigating MPLS deployment dynamics at ﬁner levels of
granularity is a topic for future study. In our analysis below, the
scope of our characterizations is bounded by the Ark measurement
data, and placement of probing nodes. However, the Ark project
has gone to great lengths to be comprehensive and we believe it
provide an important and representative view of Internet structure.
Along with the Ark data, we used the CAIDA IPv4 preﬁx to au-
tonomous system (AS) mapping data, which is based on analysis of
Routeviews data [1]. We also use UCLA Cyclops data to classify
a given AS as a tier 1, large ISP, small ISP, or stub network [2].
We use these data to perform AS-speciﬁc analyses, and to identify
the number and characteristics of ASes that appear to be employ-
ing MPLS for trafﬁc management. Since the preﬁx-to-AS mapping
data are based on a measured perspective of Internet routing ac-
tivity, there are imperfections and complications. In our analyses,
we omit any traceroute paths that have IP addresses for which
we do not know the AS number, and any IP addresses that have
multiple ASes identiﬁed in the preﬁx-to-AS mapping. We do this
to simplify our analyses of speciﬁc ASes. We note that the over-
all amount of data discarded is small (under 1%), thus we do not
believe this materially affects our overall results.
For many analyses in this section, we wanted to identify the set
of unique tunnels within an AS. We found that either using the se-
quence of IP addresses of the LSRs, or using the sequence of MPLS
labels at the bottom of the label stack gave virtually equivalent re-
sults (differences were under 0.01% of the total number of observed
tunnels).
Finally, as we discuss above, our analysis relies on the presence
of ICMP extension information to positively identify MPLS LSRs.
Thus, our analysis is limited to MPLS tunnels that have been con-
ﬁgured in uniform mode. While we are certain that there are tunnels
conﬁgured in pipe mode that evade our analysis, we have no way to
presently quantify or characterize these tunnels. Indeed, there are
ISP-published maps of MPLS networks for which we do not see
any (or exceedingly few) LSRs in our data (e.g., see Sprint’s [6]
network map and other maps available at the Internet Topology Zoo
project [7]). Moreover, we have no visibility into any MPLS vir-
tual private networks since our measurements are taken from hosts
attached to the public Internet.
4The roll-out of a new version of Scamper corresponded to the
passing of the Internet Measurement Conference paper deadline
that year.
3.2 MPLS Prevalence
We begin by examining the prevalence of MPLS tunnels, and
how many ASes appear to use MPLS. We turn ﬁrst to the total
number of ASes that we observe to use MPLS. In the top plot of
Figure 2, we see this number has remained fairly steady over the
past 3 years, at around 7%.
The bottom plot of Figure 2 shows the fraction of ASes, classi-
ﬁed by AS type, that are empirically observed to employ MPLS. We
use the UCLA Cyclops data to perform the AS classiﬁcation [2].
(Note that these classiﬁcation data are only available starting in Oc-
tober 2008.) We observe that nearly all tier 1 providers use MPLS
(in October 2008 there were 8 tier 1 providers, and in August 2011
there were 11). We observe a lesser percentage of large ISPs (50–
55%), an even smaller percentage of small ISPs (25–30%), and
few stub networks (around 5%) to use MPLS. Because there are so
many stub networks (13817 in August 2011), the overall percent-
age of ASes using MPLS is rather low (again, around 7%).
Figure 2: Comparison of the total number of ASes seen in our
Ark dataset versus the number of ASes for which at least 1
MPLS tunnel is observed (top), and the fraction of ASes by AS
type that employ MPLS (bottom).
Figure 3 plots the total number of unique tunnels observed in
a given measurement period over the past three years. The ﬁgure
shows a signiﬁcant dip in the total number of tunnels beginning in
’08, a rebound in mid ’09 and a steady increase to the current peak
of nearly 350K tunnels. For comparison, we also plot the Dow
Jones Industrial Average in the ﬁgure5. Interestingly, the total num-
ber of MPLS tunnels over time appears to indirectly track this eco-

not shown). So, while it is apparent from Figure 2 that the sheer
number of ASes using MPLS is independent of economic activ-
ity, the deployment of tunnels within these ASes roughly correlates
with economic conditions. Our conjecture is that this phenomenon
reﬂects merger and acquisition activity within the telecom industry.
We have engaged ISPs to better understand the underlying reasons
behind our observations, and we hope to report on our ﬁndings in
the future.
observed to have under 200 tunnels, and that about 10% of ASes
have at least 1000 tunnels.
Table 1 identiﬁes the numbers and names of the top 10 ASes in
terms of the number of observed MPLS tunnels. The table shows
the top 10 ASes for six month periods starting from mid-2008.
These results support the intuition and evidence in the bottom plot
of Figure 2 that larger and more complex infrastructures are more
likely to use MPLS tunnels.
Figure 3: The total number of visible MPLS tunnels over time
(solid line). The Dow Jones Industrial Average is plotted (dot-
ted line) for reference over the same time period.
Figure 4 shows the number of unique tunnels deployed by a small
set of ASes over the past three years. First, we see a sharp drop in
the number of tunnels deployed by AS7018. This drop mirrors
the drop in the total number of tunnels seen in Figure 3. We see
from the ﬁgure that other ASes show some variability over time in
the number of deployed tunnels. For example, AS1273 emerges in
early 2010 from very few (nearly zero) observed tunnels. On the
other hand, the number of tunnels observed from AS3320 drops
to zero in mid-2010. We conjecture that in addition to economic
factors, there are likely AS policy decisions (e.g., to change tunnels
to “invisible” pipe mode, or to reveal previously hidden tunnels)
that play a role in the observed variability.
Figure 5: Empirical cumulative distribution functions of the
number of visible MPLS tunnels per AS. CDFs are plotted for
six month periods starting 6/2008. (Note that the x-axis is on
log scale.)
Lastly, we examine the fraction of paths probed by Ark that in-
clude one or more MPLS tunnels. Figure 6 shows the fraction of
probing paths that cross at least 1 MPLS tunnel, and the fraction of
paths that cross exactly 1, 2, or 3 tunnels. Interestingly, although
only about 7% of all ASes are observed to use MPLS, about 25% of
all probing paths crossed at least 1 tunnel in the most recent mea-
surement data. Approximately 4% of all paths cross more than one
MPLS tunnel; this observation holds across the three years. We can
see that the increase in likelihood of crossing at least 1 MPLS tun-
nel from about 20% in June 2008 to about 25% in August 2011 is
primarily due to higher occurrences of encountering a single tunnel
on a path. This result is consistent with the fact that larger networks
are more likely to appear on end-to-end paths and are more likely
to deploy MPLS.
Figure 4: Number of observed MPLS tunnels over time across
selected ASes.
Figure 5 provides another perspective on the number of deployed
tunnels per AS. The ﬁgure shows empirical cumulative distribution
functions of the number of observed tunnels per AS for six-month
time intervals over the measurement period. We see that 20% of all
ASes have fewer than 10 tunnels. We also see that 80% of ASes are

Surprisingly,
there were some probing paths that crossed 7
MPLS tunnels, which was the maximum we observed. Also sur-
prisingly, within a single AS we observed multiple, separate tunnels
in a single probing path. That is, from the traceroute output,
we observed a series of MPLS LSR hops within an AS, followed
by one or more “normal” IP hops, followed by another series of
MPLS LSR hops. The frequency of occurrence of either many tun-
nels (> 4) on a single path, or multiple tunnels within a single AS
was quite rare (about 0.3% of all paths in May 2011).
3.3 MPLS Tunnel Characteristics
increased, but is quite short, and the plot for AS3320 shows that
tunnels in that AS are currently an average of about 1 hop long.
An interesting phenomenon suggested by Figure 8 is that of very
short 1-hop MPLS tunnels. In Figure 9, we show the fraction of
tunnels over time that consist of one hop, for a set of ASes and
globally across all tunnels. We again see a variety of behaviors.
While most ASes have very few tunnels of just 1 hop, the majority
of tunnels in AS4134 consist of only one hop, and tunnel lengths in
AS3320 have decreased to close to a single hop.
We now examine characteristics of observed MPLS tunnels, both
globally and within different ASes.
We ﬁrst examine ﬁrst-order path length statistics in ASes. We
consider three segments of a path through an AS: IP hops before
a tunnel is entered, hops within a tunnel, and IP hops after a tun-
nel, prior to exiting the AS. For this analysis, we omitted any paths
through an AS that contained multiple separate tunnels. Figure 7
shows the average number of pre-tunnel, post-tunnel, and in-tunnel
hops over the past three years. We see that the average length of
an MPLS tunnel has decreased over the measurement period from
just over 4 hops, to around 3 hops. This change likely is due to
changes in operational policy or underlying infrastructure. We also
see that the average number of pre- and post-tunnel hops has re-
mained roughly constant over the past three years, at around 1 hop
and 1.8 hops, respectively.
Figure 7: Average number of hops before, inside, and after
MPLS tunnels for all ASes.
Figure 8 plots average tunnel lengths over time for 4 different
ASes. We observe a variety of behaviors. While the average length
of a tunnel in AS7018 has decreased by around 1 hop over the past
three years, the average length of a tunnel in AS6461 has increased
by around 2 hops. The average length of a tunnel in AS4230 has
Figure 8: Average MPLS tunnel lengths for selected ASes over
time.
While there are certainly operational policy decisions and other
conﬁguration factors which may lead to the observation of 1-
hop tunnels (e.g., there may be nested tunnels that are conﬁgured
in pipe mode, making some segment of the tunnel invisible to
traceroute), one simple reason we might see such short tunnels
is the following. Consider the network in Figure 1, and assume
that there are only three LSRs in the tunnel (B, C, and D). When
a packet enters the tunnel at LSR B, it will be encapsulated in an
MPLS header and forwarded to C. C might then do a label switch
and forward it to D. At that point, the label is popped and the IP
packet emerges from the MPLS tunnel.
In traceroute output, router B would appear to be a “normal”
layer 3 hop since the packet has not yet been encapsulated, and
routers C and D would appear to be MPLS routers. Thus, we would
observe a tunnel of length 2.
Consider, however, if the ISP has conﬁgured routers to do penul-
timate hop-popping (PHP), which is basically an optimization to
avoid encapsulating a packet that has only one more hop in a tun-
nel [31], and to reduce label stack popping load on a tunnel egress
router.
In this case, we would only observe router C to employ
MPLS; D would appear as a “normal” layer 3 hop. Given our def-
inition of MPLS tunnel, we consider this to be a one-hop tunnel,
450virtually no ASes use stacks of three labels. (We observed only a
single instance of a label stack of four labels, which was AS3549
in April 2011.) The three ASes shown exhibit much different be-
havior. While AS7018 used only single-level labels in the earliest
measurement period, the majority of its tunnels now employ stacks
of two labels. AS2119 was one of the few ASes we observed to
employ label stacks of depth 3 (we never observed more than 10
ASes to use 3-deep stacks). We also see that it has very few tun-
nels that have just a single label on the stack. Lastly, we see that
AS19262 has made roughly equal use of label stacks with 1 or 2
labels. In future work we hope to gain insight into the operational
practices that lead to these observed behaviors.

nels (measured in hops). Note that the y-axis is log scale.
The MPLS header contains a 3-bit trafﬁc class ﬁeld, which can
be used by ISPs for implementing different quality of service poli-
cies and for prioritizing LSPs. Table 2 shows the fraction of ASes
employing different unique trafﬁc class identiﬁers, over the ﬁrst
month of the past three years. We see that in January 2009, 68%
of all ASes used a single trafﬁc class, 22% used two classes, and
about 10% used more than two classes. We also see that trafﬁc class
identiﬁer usage was roughly the same in January 2010 and 2011.
