security was already broken). Thus, cheating must be detected
at the ﬁrst bad ball and no later.

We consider the case of B ≥ 2 and our aim is to prove that
the probability that the adversary cheats is at most 1/N B. In
this game, unlike Sections III-A and III-B, we actually need to
open at least C = 3 triples in each subarray. We will explain
why this is necessary at the end of the proof.
We prove the theorem under the assumptions that X >
L + C (meaning that the number of subarrays is less than the
size of each subarray), that L ≥ 5 (meaning that there are at
least 5 subarrays), that C ≥ 3, and that X − C ≥ 6 (meaning
that the subarrays are at least of size C +6 which can equal 9).
All of these conditions are fulﬁlled for reasonable choices of
parameters in practice.
Theorem 3.10: Let B ≥ 2 and assume X > L+C. Then for
every adversary A and for every L ≥ 5, C ≥ 3 and X−C ≥ 6
it holds that
Pr[Game3(A, X, L, B, C) = 1] ≤ 1
N B
where N = (X − C)L.
Proof: In order to win the game, A must choose bad balls
in at least one of Game1 executions. If A chooses bad balls
in both executions, then the theorem follows directly from
Theorem 3.4, since A wins in two executions of Game1 with
N B , where the last
probability only
inequality holds when B ≥ 2 as assumed, in the theorem.
Thus, for the remainder of the proof we assume that A
chose bad balls in exactly one of Game1 executions only (note
that the cases are mutually exclusive and so the probability of
winning is the maximum probability of both cases).

Denote by S the number of subsets that contain bad buckets
after the Game1 executions (recall that we consider the case
only that these are all in the same Game1 execution), and let t
be the number of bad buckets (in the proof of Theorem 3.4,
note that t denotes the number of bad balls in the subarray;
if the adversary is not caught then this is equivalent to the
number of bad buckets). By Eq. (3) we have that
Pr[Game1(A, X, L, B, C) = 1] =
(cid:7)−(B−1)(cid:6)
