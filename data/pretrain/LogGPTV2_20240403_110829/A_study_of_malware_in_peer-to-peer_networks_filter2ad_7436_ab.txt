### Table 3: Summary of Top Malware Found in OpenFT

The malware observed in OpenFT is largely similar to that found in Limewire. Specifically, 8 out of the top 10 malware types are common between the two platforms, with the exceptions being Trojan.Downloader.Delf-286 and RAR in OpenFT, and Worm.VB-26 and Worm.P2P.Selmo.A in Limewire. In fact, 5 of the top 10 malware types listed in Tables 2 and 3 are shared, indicating a significant overlap in the presence of specific malware across different systems.

### File Types Infected

Despite downloading files with a wide range of extensions, we found that only .zip and .exe files were infected in large numbers. A very small number of .rar and .doc files were also infected, while all other file formats remained free of malware.

### 3.2 Malware Functionality

Our analysis of the downloaded files for both Limewire and OpenFT revealed a diverse array of malware, with downloaders and worms being the most prevalent types. Table 4 provides a breakdown of the functionalities of the identified malware (categorizations based on information from [1, 14, 15, 17]). Some malware programs incorporate multiple functionalities, which explains why the percentages in Table 4 exceed 100%.

| Function        | Limewire (%) | OpenFT (%) |
|-----------------|--------------|------------|
| Downloader      | 34.78%       | 39.13%     |
| Worm            | 30.43%       | 40.32%     |
| Unknown         | 17.39%       | 25.81%     |
| Backdoor        | 8.70%        | 4.84%      |
| Adware          | 4.35%        | 4.84%      |
| Dialer          | 0.0%         | 3.23%      |
| Keylogger       | 0.0%         | 0.0%       |

**Table 4: Functionality and Percentage of Malware in Limewire and OpenFT**

### 3.3 Malware Growth

Figure 1 illustrates the daily percentage of malicious traffic observed on both Limewire and OpenFT. Since our detection is limited to successfully downloaded files, this figure represents a lower bound on the actual extent of malware. A significant portion of Limewire responses was found to be infested with malware. In contrast, malware on OpenFT spiked only on one day, coinciding with the Poom.A worm outbreak.

### 3.4 Effect of Re-downloads in Limewire

As described in Section 2.3, we re-downloaded "clean" files in Limewire after 7 days to detect new malware that ClamAV [16] might not have signatures for at the time of the initial download. This process identified three new malware types: Worm.VB-26, Trojan.Clicker.VB-20, and W32.Polipos.A. These findings increased the total count of distinct malware in Limewire to 95.

### 3.5 Queries

We analyzed the queries that returned the most malware in both Limewire and OpenFT. Tables 5 and 6 list the top 10 queries for each platform. It appears that movie names are more likely to return malware in Limewire, whereas this is not the case for OpenFT.

**Table 5: Top 10 Malware-Returning Queries in Limewire**

### 3.6 Host Characteristics

Tables 7 and 8 present the top 10 IP addresses that served the most malware in Limewire and OpenFT, respectively. The host characteristics differ significantly between the two systems. In Limewire, a high proportion of malware originates from private IP addresses, while no private addresses were observed in OpenFT. Additionally, in Limewire, the top sources often serve more than one type of malware, which is not the case in OpenFT.
