            sleep_test.go:402: runtime timer stuck: overflow in addtimer
    FAIL
    FAIL    time    4.651s
    Fails on several builds, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Windows. I believe all these builders are
    running inside vm's so this could be related
    What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
    Is this test failure an actual problem, or just noise by slow builders with a poor sense
    of the passage of time ?
