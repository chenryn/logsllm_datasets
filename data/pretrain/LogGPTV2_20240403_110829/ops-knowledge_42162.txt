User: Really frustrated with this as one thing works at one time. Sometimes import filename.py works. But in the tutorials all I see is python filename.py. But when I try to give that, I am facing an error like invalid syntax.
I have edited all the environment variables and I have C:\Python27 folder in the same location. To be able to run the files using python filename.py what are the conditions that must be met? What should be the current working directory? Should the .py files be there in the same working directory?
Assistant: import name is a python keyword for use within a python script and/or the python interactive interpreter (repl).
python filename.py is a shell command for use at a command prompt or within a shell script to run the python interpreter on a given python script file.
The working directory does not matter other than for whether the file listed in python filename.py can be found.
So for python filename.py to work you must be in the same directory as filename.py but you could just as readily use python c:\users\user\some\other\path\filename.py in which case the current directory isn't used to find the file.
If you get python syntax errors from attempting to run python on a python file that's a python error in the code and you will need to look at the python file to see what the error is.
