At now Electron application store cache files near to config files in folders
`~/.config/APP/Cache` and `~/.config/APP/GPUCache`, so config folder contains
many useless files with large size (more than 200 mb).
Linux systems use separate `~/.cache` folder for store cache files, so Google
Chrome store configs in `~/.config/google-chrome` but all cache files in
`~/.cache/google-chrome`.
We can find right location of cache folder via `$XDG_CACHE_HOME` environment
variable.
Please move all Electron cache files from `~/.config/APP` to
`~/$XDG_CACHE_HOME/APP` folder, like other apps do.
