Currently, the Electron application stores its cache files in close proximity to the configuration files within the `~/.config/APP/Cache` and `~/.config/APP/GPUCache` directories. This results in the configuration folder containing numerous unnecessary files that can occupy a significant amount of disk space (often exceeding 200 MB).

In Linux systems, it is a common practice to use a dedicated `~/.cache` directory for storing cache files. For example, Google Chrome keeps its configuration files in `~/.config/google-chrome` while all cache-related files are stored in `~/.cache/google-chrome`.

To adhere to this convention, we can determine the appropriate location for the cache folder by referencing the `$XDG_CACHE_HOME` environment variable. 

We request that you move all Electron cache files from the `~/.config/APP` directory to the `~/$XDG_CACHE_HOME/APP` directory, aligning with the standard practices followed by other applications.
