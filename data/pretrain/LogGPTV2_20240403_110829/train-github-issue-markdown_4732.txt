Hello,

I have noticed that some of the command descriptions in our list are excessively long, making them difficult to read. For example, as shown in the following screenshot:

To improve readability, I suggest moving some of the detailed text to the individual command descriptions, such as those displayed when using `airflow days backfill --help`. Currently, when executing the `--help` command, we only see a list of arguments and no detailed description, as illustrated here:

After making the necessary changes, it could look like the following:

Descriptions can be set using the `description` or `epilogue` parameters. In the file `airflow/airflow/cli/cli_parser.py`, lines 1280 to 1282, the code should be modified as follows:

```python
sub_proc = subparsers.add_parser(
    sub.name, help=sub.help, description="DESCRIPTION", epilog="EPILOG"
)
```

It would be ideal if all commands had a description, even if it means duplicating the description from the main list.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.
