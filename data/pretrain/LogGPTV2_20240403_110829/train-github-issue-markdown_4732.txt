Hello,
The description of some of the commands on the list are too long. This makes
them difficult to read.

I think that some text should be moved to descriptions of individual commands
e.g. `airflow days backfill --help`. We currently do not have descriptions for
individual commands. After executing the ` \--help '' command, we only have a
list of arguments.

After making changes it may look like the screen below.

Descriptions can be set by the parameters `description` or` epilogue`.  
airflow/airflow/cli/cli_parser.py
Lines 1280 to 1282 in 8517cb1
|  sub_proc = subparsers.add_parser(  
---|---  
|  sub.name, help=sub.help  
|  )  
        sub_proc = subparsers.add_parser(
    -        sub.name, help=sub.help
    +        sub.name, help=sub.help, description="DESCRIPTION", epilog="EPILOG"
        )
I would be happy if all the commands had a description. It may duplicate the
description from the list.
