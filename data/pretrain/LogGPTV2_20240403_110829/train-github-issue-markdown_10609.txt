I have noticed that a bound CssClass value is not updated after router
navigation. The old value is not replaced by the new value during data
binding. Instead it leaves the existing one behind and adds the new one next
to it when it's rebound.
I am updating the class via a function which works ok on click, but for some
reason the class is not replaced when navigating using the new router.
Element:  
`Link`  
//Class is updated correctly when initiated via click, but not via router
navigation.
You can see the behavior here: http://www.syntaxsuccess.com/angular-2-samples
Repro steps:
Successful:  
Click the left nav and see the active link update correctly (bootstrap blue
active clas).
Failure:  
Select any of the left nav links other than the first element  
Click the 'About' link in the top navigation  
Click the 'Demo' link in the top navigation  
Observe that there are two highlighted links in the left nav.  
After debugging it I noticed that the correct functions fire, but the class
property is not overwritten by the binding.
