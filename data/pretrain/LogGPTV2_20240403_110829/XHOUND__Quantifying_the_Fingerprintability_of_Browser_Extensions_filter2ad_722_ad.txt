### Data Collection and Survey Distribution

To conduct our surveys, we first obtained the necessary permissions from our Institutional Review Board (IRB). We initially distributed the survey among colleagues and friends from institutions in the United States and Europe. To reach a broader audience, we utilized the Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) platform and sent advertisements to our campus mailing list. MTurk users were compensated upon completion of the survey, while university students participated in a raffle for multiple gift cards.

### Statistics of Extension Usage

A total of 854 participants completed our surveys, with 941 unique browser extensions installed and enabled across all users. Table IV provides detailed numbers for each group of participants. On average, each participant had 4.81 active extensions in their browsers. Interestingly, some users retained extensions that are no longer available on the market or were side-loaded from third-party websites, despite Google's disapproval of this practice. Consequently, although 941 unique extensions were identified, we were able to download and analyze only 856 of these from the Chrome Store. The statistics presented in the rest of this section are based on these 856 extensions.

### Demographic and Geographic Analysis

Our surveys targeted participants from various professions, technical backgrounds, and geographic locations. Figure 5 illustrates that Non-US MTurk users, primarily from India, and surveyed students tend to have fewer extensions installed compared to other groups. Table V shows that US MTurk workers use less popular Chrome extensions. Specifically, the average extension used by US MTurk workers is installed by approximately 835,000 users, compared to 1.4 million installations for the average extension used by "Friends and Colleagues."

### Browsing History and Extension Usage

Our survey also collected data on the size of browsing history and cookie jars to identify inactive users. As shown in Figure 6, there is a positive correlation between the size of browsing history and the number of installed extensions. However, MTurk users exhibit a different ratio between the number of extensions and the size of browsing history. Despite this, the analysis of covariance showed no significant interaction between the size of browsing history and different user groups. We used this information to create an overall set of users and to extract a subset of 641 (75.1%) "Frequent Chrome Users" whose browsing history size is above the first quartile of their respective distribution.

### Fingerprintability of Extensions

Out of the 856 unique extensions, 174 (20.3%) were fingerprintable, introducing 81 unique, on-page DOM changes. Of these, 93 extensions were fingerprintable on any arbitrary URL. To understand the fingerprintability of users, we used the concept of anonymity sets as described by Eckersley [19] and Laperdrix et al. [36]. Smaller anonymity sets indicate higher trackability. Figure 7 shows the distribution of anonymity set sizes for different survey audiences. Approximately 70% of users, except for Non-US MTurk workers, had at least one fingerprintable extension. Additionally, 14.1% of all users were uniquely identifiable, highlighting the real threat of extension-based fingerprinting to online privacy.

### Discriminatory Power of Extension-Fingerprinting

To compare the discriminatory power of extensions with other popular fingerprinting attributes, we calculated normalized values of Shannonâ€™s entropy following the approach of Laperdrix et al. [36] and Cao et al. [14]. Table VI compares the entropy values for each surveyed audience in our study to those of other attributes. The normalized entropy provided by extension-based fingerprinting can match the values of other popular attributes for desktop browsers. For users with a computer science background, such as those in our "Friends and Colleagues" group, extensions may even replace one of the most discriminating attributes, namely installed plugins. However, we acknowledge the limitation of our smaller dataset and plan to repeat the survey with a larger sample to better estimate the discriminatory power of extension-based fingerprinting.

### Implementation and Performance

Having established that browser extensions are fingerprintable and that different users use different sets of fingerprintable extensions, the next step is to understand how these findings could be applied by trackers. In this section, we describe a proof-of-concept, extension-fingerprinting script and measure its performance overhead. According to our threat model, we assume that a tracker maintains a database of detectable extensions and the on-page changes they introduce. To keep this database up-to-date, the tracker may periodically run a system similar to XHOUND on the most popular extensions in the market.
