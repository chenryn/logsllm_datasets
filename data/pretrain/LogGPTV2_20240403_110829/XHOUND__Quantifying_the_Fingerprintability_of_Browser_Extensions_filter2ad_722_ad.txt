and the extraction of data from users’ machines, we applied
and obtained permission from our
IRB that
allowed us to conduct our surveys. Initially, we distributed
our survey among colleagues and friends from US and
European institutions. We then targeted a larger audience
by making use of the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform
and by sending advertisements for volunteers to our campus
mailing list. Mechanical Turk users were compensated
directly after completing our survey, whereas students from
our university participated in a rafﬂe to win multiple gift cards.
Statistics of extension usage
Overall, 854 users participated in our surveys who had a
total of 941 unique browser extensions installed and enabled.
Table IV presents exact numbers for each set of users who
participate in our surveys. On average, surveyed users had
4.81 active extensions in their browsers. Interestingly, we
discovered that some users keep extensions that are no longer
available in the market, or are side-loaded from third-party
websites, regardless of Google’s disapproval of this practice.
As such, even though the participating users were using a total
of 941 unique browser extensions, we were able to download
and analyze only 856 of these extensions from the Chrome
Store. As such, the statistics reported in the rest of this section
are obtained using these 856 browser extensions.
By deploying different surveys we targeted participants
that represent different professions, technical backgrounds and
geographical locations. First, as Figure 5 illustrates, Non-US
Mechanical Turk users, most of whom originate from India,
along with surveyed students, tend to have less extensions
installed. Second, Table V shows that US Mechanical Turk
workers tend to use less popular Chrome extensions compared
to the other surveyed audiences. Speciﬁcally, Table V shows
that the average extension installed by the “US MTurk Work-
ers” group is installed by approximately 835K users, compared
to 1.4 million installations of the average extension of “Friends
and Colleagues”.

Size of browsing history
Fig. 6. Relation between number of installed extensions and size of browsing
history.
As mentioned earlier, our survey extension also collects
the size of browsing history and size of cookie jars to help
us identify entries of inactive users. As Figure 6 illustrates,
the size of browsing history and the number of extensions
in a user’s browser are positively correlated. The number of
extensions also depends on the particular group of users. One
may notice that MTurk users tend to have a different ratio
between the number of extensions and the size of browsing
history, e.g., even users with large browsing histories have
less installed extensions, compared to the rest of the surveyed
audiences. Even though, as shown in Figure 6,
the ﬁtted
regression lines are less steep for MTurk workers, the analysis
of covariance showed no signiﬁcant interaction between the
size of browsing history and different user groups. We take
advantage of this fact to combine an overall set of users, as
well as to extract a new subset of users across all surveyed
audiences, whose history size is above the ﬁrst quartile of
their respective distribution. We label these 641 (75.1%) users
as “Frequent Chrome Users” and report separate statistics for
them.
Fingerprintability of collected extensions

unique, on-page DOM changes. Of these 174 extensions, 93
were ﬁngerprintable on any arbitrary URL. To understand the
ﬁngerprintability of users utilizing these extensions, we use
the notion of anonymity sets as described by Eckersley [19]
and used by Laperdrix et al. in [36]. Each anonymity set
represents a group of users with the same extension-based
ﬁngerprint. The smaller the size of an anonymity set, the
more trackable, users of this set are. In its extreme, an
anonymity set with a size of one, means that a user is
uniquely identiﬁable, i.e., no other user has the same browser
extensions installed. Figure 7 shows the distribution of the
anonymity sizes of our surveyed audiences. One can see
that, for all groups of users, with the exception of Non-US
MTurk workers, approximately 70% of users had at least one
ﬁngerprintable extension. In addition, 14.1% of all users in all
groups are uniquely identiﬁable (belong to an anonymity set
of size equal to one). These results show that extension-based
ﬁngerprinting is a real threat to online privacy and could be
straightforwardly used to supplement existing ﬁngerprinting
techniques.
Discriminatory power of extension-ﬁngerprinting
To quantitatively compare extensions with other popular at-
tributes for ﬁngerprinting, we calculated the normalized values
of Shannon’s entropy, following the approach of Laperdrix et
al. [36] and Cao et al. [14]. This gives us ability to compare
entropies of ﬁngerprinting attributes investigated in previous
studies, despite the different sizes of testing sets. At the same
time, because Laperdrix et al.’s dataset is signiﬁcantly larger
than ours, we limit our comparison to the work of Cao et
al. [14] who collected 3,615 ﬁngerprints from 1,903 users.
Table VI compares the entropy values, which we calculate
for each surveyed audience of our study, to the entropy of
other attributes of desktop and mobile browsers as calculated
by Cao et al. [14]. As one can observe,
the normalized
entropy provided by extension-based ﬁngerprinting can reach
the values of other popular attributes for ﬁngerprinting desk-
top browsers. Moreover, for users from a CS background

who tend to use more extensions (the ones in our “Friends
and Colleagues” audience), extensions may even eventually
substitute one of the most discriminating attributes according
to previous studies, namely installed plugins. However, we
again acknowledge the limitation of our study in terms of the
signiﬁcantly smaller set of collected ﬁngerprints compared to
other studies and how this could be biasing our normalized
results. For this reason, Table VI also shows the actual, non-
normalized, entropy values. We hope to be able to, in the
future, repeat our survey against a larger set of users in order
to better estimate the discriminatory power of extension-based
ﬁngerprinting.
V. IMPLEMENTATION & PERFORMANCE
Having shown that browser extensions are ﬁngerprintable
and that different users tend to use different sets of ﬁnger-
printable extensions, the only question that remains is how our
ﬁndings could be put into practice by trackers. In this section,
we describe a proof-of-concept, extension-ﬁngerprinting script
and measure its performance overhead.
According to our threat models, we assume that an attacker,
i.e., a tracker, keeps a database of detectable extensions with
the on-page changes that each extension introduces. To keep
such a database up-to-date the attacker may periodically run
a system similar to XHOUND on a market’s most popular
