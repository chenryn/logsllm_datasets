a caller name, speaking in a recorded human, female voice, in
American accent, impersonating an internal entity, motivating
the recipient with a relevant fear-based scenario.
To prevent falling victim to these types of phishing scams,
we believe that the key is to target and prevent impersonation.
Our statistical results have shown that impersonating an in-
ternal entity had a signiﬁcant effect on the scam. To address
the impersonation issue, feedback from our survey partici-
pants suggests that vigilance was an important reason for not
falling for a scam. Many surveyed subjects expressed distrust
towards our scam calls when they were already vigilant about
the scam scenario. Therefore, we recommend education and
awareness of telephone phishing as a countermeasure.
On technical solutions, we recommend a similar approach
to help the subjects stay vigilant against phishing calls. There
To our knowledge, there have been no prior empirical user
studies on telephone phishing. The most similar work we
found was by Aburrous et al. [36], who performed a phone
phishing experiment on a group of 50 employees contacted by
female colleagues assigned to lure them into giving away their
personal e-banking usernames and passwords. They were able
to deceive 32% of the employees to give out their e-banking
credentials. In the experiment, the 50 employees already knew
the female colleagues that contacted them, which suggests an
insider attack rather than an impersonation attack.
Other related work studied phishing using different chan-
nels. Dhamija et al. performed a website phishing study on 22
university participants and their best phishing site was able
to fool more than 90% of participants [37]. Egelman et al.
performed an email and website phishing experiment on 60
in-person participants to test the effectiveness of various web
browser phishing warnings at that time, and it was found that
79% of Internet Explorer 7.0 participants heeded the active
phishing warnings and only 13% of them obeyed the passive
warnings [38]. Jagatic et al. performed a social media spear
phishing study on 481 targeted Indiana University student
emails obtained by crawling social network websites and it
had a 72% success rate of recipients authenticating themselves
on a redirected website [13]. Vidas et al. performed a QR code
phishing study where the experiment distributed 139 posters
containing QR codes at various locations at Carnegie Mellon
University and the city of Pittsburgh, the experiment was able
to trick 225 individuals to visit the associated website in four
weeks [39].

study was executed using 10 experiments simulating tele-
phone phishing attacks, administered to 3,000 work phones
of university staff and faculty over the course of a workweek.
The results were collected from the inputs and survey re-
sponses of the phone recipients. We analyzed the results by
performing linear regression and statistical hypothesis testing
methods on a chosen metric derived from the inputs, and we
were able to identify at least one attribute that had a signiﬁcant
effect. We provided a discussion on how to effectively prevent
such types of telephone phishing scams, and we believe that
the best countermeasures should target impersonation and
instill vigilance.

C Debrieﬁng Message
Hi, I am [redacted for anonymity] in the Department
of Computer Science at Arizona State University.
I am conducting a research study to measure the
effectiveness of telephone phishing. The reason you
are receiving this message is because I would like to
inform you that what you just did could potentially
lead you becoming exploited in a real telephone
scam. However, I would like to assure you that this
is not an actual scam, none of your social security
information was actually collected.
We would like to invite you to participate in our
phone survey, to help us better understand your
thoughts about the scam. You will be able to lis-
ten to the survey questions right after this message.
Your participation in this survey is voluntary. There
are no foreseeable risks for your participation. If
you choose not to participate or to withdraw from
the survey at any time, there will be no penalty.
Your responses will be anonymous. The results of
this study may be used in reports, presentations,
or publications but your identity will not be used.
Please press 1 to listen to the survey questions or
participate in the phone survey.
D Survey Questions
D.1 Did the scam convince you
Thank you. Could you please help us understand

E Ending Message
Thank you. This is the end of the research exper-
iment. If you have any questions concerning the
research study, please contact the research team at
[redacted for anonymity]. If you have any questions
about your rights as a participant in this research,
or if you feel you have been placed at risk, you can
