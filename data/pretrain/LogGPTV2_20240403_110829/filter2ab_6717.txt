**ATT&CK ID: M1052**
**ATT&CK Technique Name: User Account Control (UAC)**

To modify the behavior of UAC for standard users, you can adjust the following registry settings:

1. **Disable Privilege Elevation for Standard Users:**

   - Navigate to the following registry key:
     ```
     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System
     ```

   - Add or modify the `ConsentPromptBehaviorUser` value to automatically deny elevation requests:
     ```
     "ConsentPromptBehaviorUser"=dword:00000000
     ```

2. **Enable Installer Detection for All Users:**

   - To prompt for a password during installation and log the attempt, add or modify the `EnableInstallerDetection` value:
     ```
     "EnableInstallerDetection"=dword:00000001
     ```

3. **Disable Installer Detection:**

   - If you prefer to allow the installation process to continue without being logged, set the `EnableInstallerDetection` value to:
     ```
     "EnableInstallerDetection"=dword:00000000
     ```

Disabling installer detection may prevent potential privilege escalation through exploitation during the UAC detection process, but it will also result in the installation attempts not being logged. This should be considered carefully based on your security requirements.
