Question: A company decides to adopt WebAssembly for software fault isolation in their new web application to run high-performance code. As a cybersecurity expert, you are tasked to evaluate the decision. Given the considerations for using WebAssembly, which of the following statements are accurate concerning the advantages and limitations of WebAssembly for software fault isolation?
"A": "WebAssembly provides a consistent performance advantage due to its ability to translate into native code, bypassing the need for an interpreter.",
"B": "WebAssembly can be deployed without requiring special privileges or pre-configured systems by administrators, unlike containers or VMs.",
"C": "WebAssembly requires developers and devices to cooperate, which can be a limitation compared to containers or VMs that can run existing Linux applications without modification.",
"D": "WebAssembly's reliance on hardware or OS support for isolation makes it less flexible than other mechanisms that also provide hardware support."
Answer: ABC
