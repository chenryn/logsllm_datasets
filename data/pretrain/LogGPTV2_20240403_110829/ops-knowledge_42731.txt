**Question:**
Is it possible to migrate MySQL to a different hosting provider using replication? I am considering switching to a new hosting provider and would like to know if it is feasible to migrate the MySQL 5.6 database without significant downtime (i.e., the time required to copy tens of gigabytes of database files from one host to another).

**Proposed Solution:**
I am contemplating configuring the current live MySQL database as the master and setting up the new machine as a slave. The goal is to have the master continue to accept new data inserts and updates without waiting for the slave to confirm, while the slave gradually (and without consuming too many resources on the master) synchronizes itself. This synchronization process might take up to a day or even a couple of days, whereas a full-speed file copy would take approximately four hours.

During this synchronization period, I would set up the web server and other services on the new machine. Once the slave is fully synchronized, I plan to switch the DNS and convert the slave to a single master mode, then disconnect the old machine. I anticipate that some data might be lost during the DNS switch (as some clients with the old DNS record might still access the old server, and these changes would not replicate to the new machine). However, I expect this window to be around 15 minutes, which is acceptable.

**Query:**
Is such a migration approach feasible and relatively straightforward? An alternative would be a downtime of about four hours to copy all files to the new server and start it, but I am not satisfied with such a long downtime. I am willing to restart the database service/daemon a few times during the process to switch to the new configuration. I do not want to perform this migration using dumps, as I would need to manually resync tables.

**Response:**
Yes, you can achieve this migration using a snapshot dump approach:

1. **Enable Binary Logging:**
   - Enable `log-bin` on the master.
   
2. **Create a Snapshot Dump:**
   - Perform a `mysqldump --master-data=1 --all-databases` on the master. This will include the binary log positions in the dump. Depending on your database types (only InnoDB can use `--single-transaction`), this will lock the database for the duration of the dump, which should be minimal.

3. **Set Up the Slave:**
   - Import the dump into the new slave server.
   - Use the `CHANGE MASTER TO ...;` command to configure the slave to point to the master, and then start the slave with `SLAVE START;`. The slave will begin catching up to the running master.

4. **Synchronize and Switch:**
   - Once the slave is fully synchronized, you can make the switch.
   - To avoid DNS-based delays, you can use an `iptables DNAT` port redirection to the slave.

This approach minimizes downtime and ensures a smooth transition to the new hosting provider.
