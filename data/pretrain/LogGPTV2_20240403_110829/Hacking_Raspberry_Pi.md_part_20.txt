### Configuring and Installing phpMyAdmin

1. Press `Enter` to continue.
2. When the next "Configuring phpmyadmin" screen displays, select `Yes` to install the phpMyAdmin database.
3. Enter the MySQL root user password and press `Enter` to continue. You will then be prompted to create and confirm a phpMyAdmin administrator password.
4. Open the Apache 2 configuration file to link Apache to phpMyAdmin:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
   ```
5. In the `nano` editor, press `Ctrl+V` repeatedly to scroll to the bottom of the file. Add the following line, save the changes, and exit `nano`:
   ```apache
   Include /etc/phpmyadmin/apache.conf
   ```
6. Restart Apache to apply the changes:
   ```bash
   sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
   ```
7. To test phpMyAdmin, start LXDE, open Midori (or your preferred web browser), and navigate to the following URL:
   ```
   http://localhost/phpmyadmin
   ```
   Log in with the username `root` and the MySQL administrator password you specified. If you see the interface shown in Figure 15.6, the installation is successful.

**Note:** For further learning, Packt Publishing has released a series of books on how to use phpMyAdmin. Check them out at [http://is.gd/OyFw0J](http://is.gd/OyFw0J).

### Considerations for Using Midori

While I appreciate the minimalist design of Midori, it may not handle more complex web applications well. For instance, phpMyAdmin may display artifacts on the screen. As an alternative, consider installing Iceweasel, the Debian port of Mozilla Firefox. To install Iceweasel, run:
```bash
sudo apt-get install iceweasel
```
Confirm the installation and check the Internet folder in the LXPanel menu.

### Setting Up Joomla

Joomla (http://is.gd/Xl2hSu) is a leading content management system (CMS) platform. Many businesses use Joomla because it is open source, free, and highly flexible. Joomla is a PHP/MySQL-based web application, making it suitable for a LAMP stack environment. The default Joomla Home page is shown in Figure 15.7.

**Figure 15.7:** Joomla is an excellent content management platform.

Joomla can be used for various purposes, such as building corporate websites, blogs, or online photo/video galleries. For detailed instructions on using Joomla, refer to "The Official Joomla! Book" by Jennifer Marriott and Elin Waring (http://is.gd/BA3jtO).

Despite its rich features, Joomla runs reasonably well on the Raspberry Pi. Let's go through the installation process.

### Task: Installing Joomla on Your Raspberry Pi

1. From LXDE, open your preferred web browser, visit [http://is.gd/spdPUN](http://is.gd/spdPUN), and download the latest version of Joomla. The installer will typically be a ZIP archive downloaded to your home directory.
2. Open a Terminal session and unpack the Joomla contents to the default Apache content directory:
   ```bash
   cd
   sudo unzip joomla.zip -d /var/www
   ```
   Replace `joomla.zip` with the actual name of the Joomla ZIP file you downloaded.
3. Tweak the PHP configuration file:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini
   ```
4. In `nano`, press `Ctrl+W` to search for the string `output_buffering`.
5. Set the `Development Value` and `Production Value` parameters to `0`.
6. Save the file and exit `nano` by pressing `Ctrl+O`, `Enter`, and then `Ctrl+X`.
7. Reboot the Pi:
   ```bash
   sudo reboot
   ```
8. After the reboot, open another Terminal session, create the Joomla configuration file, and make it writable:
   ```bash
   cd /var/www
   sudo touch configuration.php
   sudo chmod 777 configuration.php
   ```
9. Complete the installation via a web browser. Open Midori, Iceweasel, or your preferred web browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost
   ```
10. If you see the default Apache page instead of the Joomla page, delete the old `index.html` page:
    ```bash
    sudo rm index.html
    ```
11. You will be prompted to walk through a three-step initial configuration wizard, as shown in Figure 15.8.

**Figure 15.8:** Joomla’s initial configuration wizard.

- **Main Configuration:** Site name, description, Joomla administrator login, and contact details.
- **Database:** Connection details to MySQL.
- **Finalization:** Install sample data, email data, and confirm installation defaults.

12. For security reasons, delete the installation folder after completing the setup. If you encounter an error, perform this action through Terminal:
    ```bash
    cd /var/www
    sudo rm -rf installation/
    ```

### Putting Your Web Server on the Public Internet

To make your Raspberry Pi web server accessible on the global Internet, follow these steps:

1. **Configure a Static IP Address:** (Refer to Chapter 7 for instructions).
2. **Use a Dynamic DNS Service:** Dynamic DNS services are necessary because DHCP periodically assigns new IP addresses, making reliable connections difficult.

**Dynamic DNS Providers:**
- No-IP (http://is.gd/hhmpFu)
- DynDNS (http://is.gd/nKysbj)

Both providers offer free and paid plans.

### Task: Making Your Raspberry Pi Publicly Accessible Using No-IP

1. Create a subdirectory in your home directory for the No-IP client software:
   ```bash
   cd
   mkdir noip
   cd noip
   ```
2. Download the No-IP dynamic update client (DUC) software:
   ```bash
   wget http://www.no-ip.com/client/linux/noip-duc-linux.tar.gz
   ```
3. Unpack the compressed tarball and navigate into the new folder:
   ```bash
   tar vzxf no-ip-duc-linux.tar.gz
   ls no*
   cd noip-2.1.9-1
   ```
   Note: Use the `ls` command to verify the extracted directory name, as the version might differ.

4. Compile the software:
   ```bash
   sudo make
   sudo make install
   ```
   During installation, you will be prompted to enter your No-IP membership credentials and specify a default refresh interval.

5. Run the No-IP client:
   ```bash
   sudo /usr/local/bin/noip2
   ```

If your Raspberry Pi is a DHCP client, log into your router and set up port forwarding to allow traffic on TCP port 80 (HTTP) to your Raspberry Pi’s internal IP address. Refer to Figure 15.10 for an example setup.

**Figure 15.10:** Port forwarding setup for the Raspberry Pi.

To test the public IP, open a web browser on another computer, preferably on a remote network, and try loading the Joomla site you created. For example, if your No-IP DNS name is `timwarner.no-ip.biz`, type:
```
http://timwarner.no-ip.biz
```

For instructions on running the No-IP client at startup, visit [http://is.gd/VVolQr](http://is.gd/VVolQr).

### Chapter 16: Raspberry Pi Portable Webcam

In this chapter, you will learn how to take still pictures and record video with your Raspberry Pi. Potential uses include time-lapse photography, baby monitors, security cameras, bird feeder cams, and more.

#### About the Raspberry Pi Camera Board

The Model A and Model B boards include a Camera Serial Interface 2 (CSI-2) camera connector, labeled S5 and located between the USB and HDMI ports. Initially, the Foundation did not provide a camera, but in May 2013, they introduced the Raspberry Pi Camera Board, which connects to the CSI-2 interface.

**Raspberry Pi Camera Board Specifications:**

| Specification | Details |
|---------------|---------|
| Resolution    | 5MP     |
| Video         | 1080p30, 720p60, 640x480p60, 640x480p90 |
| Lens          | Fixed focus, f/2.8, 5.6mm focal length |
| Dimensions    | 25mm x 24mm x 9mm |
| Weight        | 3g      |

The Camera Board ships in an anti-static bag enclosed in a minimalist paper box. Handle the ribbon cable carefully to avoid kinking, and do not touch the camera lens to prevent smudges.

### Installing and Configuring the Raspberry Pi Camera Board

#### Task: Preparing the Raspberry Pi for the Camera Board

1. Do not connect the Camera Board yet. Power on the Pi, access a Terminal prompt, and update your software:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
   ```
2. Enter Raspi-Config:
   ```bash
   sudo raspi-config
   ```
3. Select the `Camera` option and press `Enter`.
4. In the "Enable support for Raspberry Pi camera?" dialog box, select `Enable` and press `Enter`.
5. Exit Raspi-Config and reboot your Pi. After the reboot, shut down the system to prepare for the Camera Board installation:
   ```bash
   sudo shutdown -h now
   ```

#### Task: Installing the Raspberry Pi Camera Board

1. Ensure the Raspberry Pi is powered off and unplug all cables.
2. Gently lift the retaining clip on the CSI-2 connector.
3. Insert the Camera Board ribbon cable into the CSI-2 interface with the copper traces facing away from the USB ports.
4. Gently press down the retaining clip to secure the cable.

**Figure 16.5:** The Raspberry Pi and Camera Board are now a functional unit.

### Using the Camera Board

The Raspberry Pi Foundation provides two command-line utilities for the Camera Board:

- `raspistill`: Takes still images in JPEG and RAW formats.
- `raspivid`: Records video using the H.264 codec.

#### Capturing Still Pictures

To get help with `raspistill` syntax:
```bash
raspistill | less
```

**Figure 16.6:** `raspistill` command syntax.

To take a picture:
```bash
raspistill -o myimage.jpg
```

When you run `raspistill`, an LED on the Camera Board will light up for about four seconds, and the image will be captured just before the LED turns off. Images are stored in the current working directory.

From LXDE, double-click the image files to open them in your default web browser or right-click and select ImageMagick (display) to view them in the ImageMagick image viewer.

**Figure 16.7:** Sample image taken with the Raspberry Pi Camera Board.

You can also use additional options to control the delay and image quality. For example:
```bash
raspistill -o myimage.jpg -t 5000 -q 100
```

This command takes a high-quality image after a 5-second delay.
