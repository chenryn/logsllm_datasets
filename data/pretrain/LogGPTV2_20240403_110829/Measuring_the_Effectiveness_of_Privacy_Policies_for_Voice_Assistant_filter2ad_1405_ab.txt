Privacy Policy Dataset. We collected 64,720 unique skills under
21 categories from Alexa’s skills store and 17,952 of these skills
provide privacy policy links. Among the 2,201 Google actions we
collected, 1,967 have privacy policy links.
Figure 2: Length of a privacy policy.
For each skill/action with a valid policy link, we calculated the
number of words in the document. Fig. 2 shows the cumulative
distribution function of the privacy policy length. The average
length is 2,336 words for Alexa skills and 1,479 words for Google
actions, respectively. We also observed many very short privacy
policies which are not informative. An example is the Google action
"Mister Baavlo" which says "We do not store any of your data" but

Description Dataset. Description of a voice-app is intended to
introduce the voice-app to end users with information regarding its
functionality and other relevant information. It may also contain
data practices (e.g., the data required to be collected to achieve a
functionality) of the voice-app. We collected voice-app descriptions
and used them as baselines to detect potentially inconsistent privacy
policies. In our dataset, all skills/actions come with descriptions.
3.2 Capturing data practices
In order to automatically capture data practices in privacy policies
and descriptions of voice-apps, we develop a keyword-based ap-
proach using NLP. However, we want to emphasize that we do not
claim to resolve challenges for comprehensively extracting data
practices (i.e., data collection, sharing, and storing) from natural
language policies. Instead, we mainly focus on obtaining empiri-
cal evidences of problematic privacy policies using a simple and
accurate (i.e., in terms of the true positive) approach. We discuss
the limitation of our approach in Section 6.
Verb set related to data practices. Researchers in [20, 41] have
summarized four types of verbs commonly used in privacy policies:
Collect, Use, Retain and Disclose. Each type contains seman-
tically similar verbs in terms of the functionality. Collect means
an app would collect, gather, or acquire data from user; Use indi-
cates an app would use or process data; Retain means storing or
remembering user data; and Disclose means an app would share
or transfer data to another party.

Table 2: Keyword dictionary related to data practices.
Noun set related to data practices. From Amazon’s skill per-
mission list [5] and Amazon Developer Services Agreement [3], we
manually collected a dictionary of 16 nouns related to data practices.
Table 2 lists a dictionary with 40 verbs and 16 nouns that we used
in our privacy policy analysis.
Phrases extraction. We first parsed a privacy policy into sen-
tences. We used the SpaCy library [8] to analyze each sentence, and
obtained the attribute for each word. SpaCy can effectively find the
straight correlation between a noun and a verb and ignore other
words in a sentence. We identified three types of basic phrases:
• noun (subject) + verb, e.g., "Alexa (will) tell" or "email (is)
required"
• verb + noun (object), e.g., "send (a) message"
• verb + noun (object) + noun + noun, e.g., "tell (you) (the)
name (of) meeting (on) (your) calendar"
Next, we combined two basic phrases to generate a longer phrase
if they share the same verb. The combined phrase would follow
patterns: "subject+verb+object" or "subject+is+passive verb". For ex-
ample, for a sentence "Alexa skill will quickly tell you the name and
time of the next meeting on your Outlook calendar", we obtained
the phrase "Alex tell name, meeting, calendar".
Identifying data practices. Given all phrases extracted from
the privacy policy and description, we used the verb and noun
sets in Table 2 to identify data practice phrases. Specifically, we
compared the similarity of verb and noun in each phrase with the
verb and noun sets respectively. If the similarity is higher than
a threshold, we consider the phrase as a data practice phrase. To
measure the semantic similarity of two phrases, we used the simi-
larity measurement based on word2vec provided by SpaCy, which
is determined by comparing two word vectors. We set the similarity
threshold to 0.8 in our analysis, so as to achieve a high true positive
rate (but no guarantee of the false negative rate). For example, our
tool identified privacy policies of 1,117 skills in Amazon Alexa and
95 actions in Google Assistant having zero data practice (details
are in Sec. 4.2.2). Our manual analysis confirmed that these privacy
policies do contain no data practice.
3.3 Inconsistency checking
With description phrases and privacy policy phrases for each voice-
app, we checked any potential inconsistency between them. First,
if the data practice phrases in a description are not semantically
similar to any data practice phrase in the corresponding privacy pol-
icy, we consider this privacy policy to be incomplete. For example,
the description of skill "Thought Leaders" mentions "Permission
required: Customer’s Full name, Customer’s Email Address, Cus-
tomer’s Phone number", but none of them are mentioned in its
privacy policy. We consider it an incomplete privacy policy.
Second, since Amazon Alexa only requires skills that collect per-
sonal information to provide a privacy policy, we detected whether
a privacy policy of an Alexa skill is missing although it is required.
If the description mentions that a skill collects some data but the
skill has no privacy policy, we consider that the skill lacks a privacy
policy. For example, a skill "Heritage Flag Color" mentions "The
device location is required" in its description. But the developer
doesn’t provide a privacy policy. Note that it only reflects an incon-
sistency between the privacy policy and description since there is a
lack of the ground truth to validate whether the skill really collects
the location information or not.
4 MAJOR FINDINGS
In this section, we discuss major findings from our analysis of the
privacy policies available in the stores of both Amazon Alexa and
Google Assistant. We first present high-level issues such as broken
and incorrect privacy policy URLs, duplicate privacy policy links,
and issues in Google and Amazon’s official voice-apps. Then, we
conduct a content analysis of privacy policies, and discuss the issues
4
such as zero data practice and inconsistency in privacy policies. In
addition, we discuss usability issues of privacy policies for voice-
apps. We back our findings with representative examples that we
found from the app stores during our analysis.

Table 3: Statistics of privacy policies on two VA platforms.
4.1.1 Not all voice-apps have a privacy policy URL. Both Google
and Amazon have taken different approaches when it comes to the
requirement of a privacy policy for each voice-app available to users.
While Google has made it mandatory for developers to provide a
privacy policy along with each action, Amazon is more lenient
and makes it a requirement only for skills that declare that they
collect personal information through the skill. On analyzing the
stores, we have noticed irregularities concerning this, as illustrated
in Table 3. Out of the 2,201 actions we collected from the Google
action directory, only 1,967 have privacy policies provided which
means that 11% of the actions do not have a privacy policy provided.
While it is not possible to submit an action for certification without
including a privacy policy URL, it is puzzling how these actions are
available in the store without providing one. Out of these 234 actions
that do not have privacy policies, 101 actions were developed by
Google while the other 133 actions were developed by 41 other
developers.
In the case of Alexa skills, as shown in Table 3, only 17,952 (28%)
skills have a privacy policy out of the 64,720 skills we collected
(i.e., 46,768 skills without a privacy policy). It is partially because
of the lenient skill certification in Alexa. After conducting further
experiments on the skill certification, we have understood that even
if a skill collects personal information, the developer can choose
to not declare it during the certification stage and bypass the pri-
vacy policy requirement. This is achieved by collecting personal
information through the conversational interface (e.g., asking users’
names). Even though this data collection is prohibited, the certifica-
tion system of Amazon Alexa doesn’t reject such skills. As a result,
developers may choose to not provide a privacy policy. Amazon
only requires skills that collect personal data to provide a privacy
policy, and thus not all these 46,768 skills require a privacy policy. In
Sec. 4.2.4, we identify skills that potentially lack a required privacy
policy.
4.1.2 Broken links and incorrect URLs. For those actions and
skills that have provided a privacy policy URL, not every URL leads
to the page containing a privacy policy. Through our experiments,
we found 80 Google actions and 1,755 Alexa skills that have pro-
vided broken privacy policy URLs, as shown in Table 3. There are
also URLs which lead to other developer’s privacy policies. An
example for this is the skill "NORAD Tracks Santa" by NORAD
which provides a privacy policy URL that links to Amazon’s privacy
Figure 3: Landing page of the privacy policy URL provided
with the Google action and Alexa skill developed by Ru-
betek.
policy page instead of a privacy policy written by the developer.
The privacy policy URL of "Rubetek SmartHome" which is both an
Alexa skill and a Google action leads to the company’s homepage
which promotes its products, as shown in Fig. 3, rather than linking
to the privacy policy page. Sec. 4.2 presents our content analysis of
privacy policies, which provides more details about the voice-apps
with incorrect privacy policy URLs.
Figure 4: Duplicate privacy policy URLs in two platforms.
4.1.3 Duplicate URLs. We found a substantial portion of privacy
policies share same URLs. In particular, Amazon Alexa has more
than 56% of skills with duplicate privacy policy URLs. Fig. 4 shows
the prevalence of duplicate privacy policy URLs in both platforms.
Out of the 17,952 Amazon skills with privacy policies, 7,828 skills
have a unique privacy policy URL. The other 10,124 skills (56.4%)
share 1,206 different privacy policy URLs. Out of these, 1,783 skills
(9.9%) have provided the same link (https://getstoryline.com/public/
privacy.html) as their privacy policy URLs. Note that these 1,783
skills are not from the same developer which indicates that the
privacy policy is irrelevant to these skills. Table 4 lists the most
common privacy policy URLs in Alexa and Google platforms. The
issue of duplicate URLs is more serious on Amazon Alexa platform.
The top three duplicate URLs are shared by 3,205 skills, constituting
17.8% of the total skills that have a privacy policy. As shown in
Fig. 4, the Google Assistant platform has 12.2% of actions with
duplicate privacy policy URLs. 1,728 out of 1,967 actions have a
unique privacy policy. The other 239 actions share 64 different
privacy policy URLs.

Table 4: The most common duplicate privacy policy URLs.
To understand why there exists such a large number of voice-
apps with duplicate privacy policy URLs especially on Amazon
Alexa platform, we further examined the developer information
of these voice-apps. Our intuition is that developers who pub-
lished multiple voice-apps may use the same privacy policy URLs.
We found that for the developers who developed more than one
skill, 77% of their skills use duplicate privacy policy URLs. Ta-
ble 5 lists the top 5 developers who published the most skills
with a privacy policy on Amazon Alexa platform. As illustrated
in the table, 2,064 out of 2,069 skills (99.8%) use duplicate pri-
vacy policy URLs. Obviously, the content of these privacy pol-
icy URLs are not skill-specific, and users may skip reading the
privacy policy although it is provided. A serious problem hap-
pens if such a privacy policy link is broken, which results in hun-
dreds of skills being affected. For example, we found a broken
link "https://www.freshdigitalgroup.com/privacy-policy-for-bots"
(shown in Table 5). There are 217 skills using this link, and thus all
their privacy policies become inaccessible. As to the Google actions,
we also observed the similar issue. Although Google requires that
a privacy policy must include one of the following: action name,
company name or developer email, there are developers using a
general privacy policy with the company name or email for all their
actions. For the developers who published more than one action,
27.5% of actions have duplicate privacy policy URLs. For the top 10
developers who published the most actions, 86% of their actions
use a duplicate privacy policy link.
