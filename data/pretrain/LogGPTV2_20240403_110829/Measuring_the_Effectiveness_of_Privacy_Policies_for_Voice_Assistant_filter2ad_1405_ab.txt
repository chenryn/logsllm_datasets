### Privacy Policy Dataset

We collected 64,720 unique skills across 21 categories from the Alexa Skills Store, of which 17,952 provide privacy policy links. Additionally, out of the 2,201 Google Actions we collected, 1,967 have privacy policy links.

#### Figure 2: Length of Privacy Policies
For each skill or action with a valid privacy policy link, we calculated the number of words in the document. Figure 2 shows the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the privacy policy lengths. The average length is 2,336 words for Alexa skills and 1,479 words for Google Actions. We also observed many very short privacy policies that are not informative. For example, the Google Action "Mister Baavlo" states, "We do not store any of your data," but provides no further details.

### Description Dataset
The description of a voice-app is intended to introduce the app to end users, providing information about its functionality and other relevant details. It may also include data practices, such as the data required to achieve specific functionalities. We collected descriptions for all skills and actions and used them as baselines to detect potentially inconsistent privacy policies. In our dataset, all skills and actions come with descriptions.

### 3.2 Capturing Data Practices
To automatically capture data practices in privacy policies and descriptions, we developed a keyword-based approach using Natural Language Processing (NLP). However, it is important to note that this approach does not claim to comprehensively extract all data practices (i.e., data collection, sharing, and storage) from natural language policies. Instead, we focus on obtaining empirical evidence of problematic privacy policies using a simple and accurate method. The limitations of our approach are discussed in Section 6.

#### Verb Set Related to Data Practices
Researchers in [20, 41] have summarized four types of verbs commonly used in privacy policies:
- **Collect**: Indicates an app would collect, gather, or acquire data from the user.
- **Use**: Indicates an app would use or process data.
- **Retain**: Indicates storing or remembering user data.
- **Disclose**: Indicates an app would share or transfer data to another party.

**Verb Set:**
- Access, Ask, Assign, Collect, Create, Enter, Gather, Import, Obtain, Observe, Organize, Provide, Receive, Request, Share, Use, Include, Integrate, Monitor, Process, See, Utilize, Retain, Cache, Delete, Erase, Keep, Remove, Store, Transfer, Communicate, Disclose, Reveal, Sell, Send, Update, View, Need, Require, Save

**Noun Set:**
- Address, Name, Email, Phone, Birthday, Age, Gender, Location, Data, Contact, Phonebook, SMS, Call, Profession, Income, Information

#### Noun Set Related to Data Practices
From Amazon’s skill permission list [5] and Amazon Developer Services Agreement [3], we manually collected a dictionary of 16 nouns related to data practices. Table 2 lists a dictionary with 40 verbs and 16 nouns used in our privacy policy analysis.

#### Phrases Extraction
We first parsed each privacy policy into sentences using the SpaCy library [8] to analyze each sentence and obtain the attributes for each word. SpaCy effectively finds the direct correlation between a noun and a verb, ignoring other words in the sentence. We identified three types of basic phrases:
- **Noun (subject) + Verb**: e.g., "Alexa (will) tell" or "email (is) required"
- **Verb + Noun (object)**: e.g., "send (a) message"
- **Verb + Noun (object) + Noun + Noun**: e.g., "tell (you) (the) name (of) meeting (on) (your) calendar"

Next, we combined two basic phrases to generate a longer phrase if they share the same verb. The combined phrase follows patterns like "subject+verb+object" or "subject+is+passive verb." For example, for the sentence "Alexa skill will quickly tell you the name and time of the next meeting on your Outlook calendar," we obtained the phrase "Alexa tell name, meeting, calendar."

#### Identifying Data Practices
Given all phrases extracted from the privacy policy and description, we used the verb and noun sets in Table 2 to identify data practice phrases. Specifically, we compared the similarity of the verb and noun in each phrase with the verb and noun sets, respectively. If the similarity is higher than a threshold, we consider the phrase as a data practice phrase. To measure the semantic similarity of two phrases, we used the similarity measurement based on word2vec provided by SpaCy, which compares two word vectors. We set the similarity threshold to 0.8 to achieve a high true positive rate (but with no guarantee of the false negative rate).

For example, our tool identified 1,117 skills in Amazon Alexa and 95 actions in Google Assistant that have zero data practice (details in Sec. 4.2.2). Our manual analysis confirmed that these privacy policies do not contain any data practices.

### 3.3 Inconsistency Checking
With the description phrases and privacy policy phrases for each voice-app, we checked for potential inconsistencies between them. First, if the data practice phrases in a description are not semantically similar to any data practice phrase in the corresponding privacy policy, we consider the privacy policy to be incomplete. For example, the description of the skill "Thought Leaders" mentions "Permission required: Customer’s Full name, Customer’s Email Address, Customer’s Phone number," but none of these are mentioned in its privacy policy. We consider this an incomplete privacy policy.

Second, since Amazon Alexa only requires skills that collect personal information to provide a privacy policy, we detected whether a privacy policy of an Alexa skill is missing even though it is required. If the description mentions that a skill collects some data but the skill has no privacy policy, we consider that the skill lacks a privacy policy. For example, the skill "Heritage Flag Color" mentions "The device location is required" in its description, but the developer does not provide a privacy policy. Note that this only reflects an inconsistency between the privacy policy and description, as there is no ground truth to validate whether the skill really collects the location information.

### 4. Major Findings
In this section, we discuss major findings from our analysis of privacy policies available in the stores of both Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant. We first present high-level issues such as broken and incorrect privacy policy URLs, duplicate privacy policy links, and issues in Google and Amazon’s official voice-apps. Then, we conduct a content analysis of privacy policies, discussing issues such as zero data practice and inconsistencies in privacy policies. Additionally, we discuss usability issues of privacy policies for voice-apps, backing our findings with representative examples from the app stores.

#### 4.1 High-Level Issues
- **Without Privacy Policy**
- **Valid Privacy Policy URL**
- **Broken Privacy Policy URL**

| Platform          | Total #   | Percentage |
|-------------------|-----------|------------|
| Amazon Skills     | 64,720    | 100%       |
| - Without Policy  | 46,768    | 72%        |
| - Valid URL       | 16,197    | 25%        |
| - Broken URL      | 1,755     | 3%         |
| Google Actions    | 2,201     | 100%       |
| - Without Policy  | 234       | 11%        |
| - Valid URL       | 1,887     | 85%        |
| - Broken URL      | 80        | 4%         |

#### 4.1.1 Not All Voice-Apps Have a Privacy Policy URL
Both Google and Amazon have different approaches to requiring privacy policies for voice-apps. Google mandates a privacy policy for each action, while Amazon only requires one for skills that declare they collect personal information. We found irregularities in this requirement, as shown in Table 3. Out of 2,201 Google Actions, 1,967 have privacy policies, meaning 11% do not. Despite the requirement, 101 of these actions were developed by Google, and 133 by 41 other developers.

For Alexa skills, only 17,952 (28%) have a privacy policy out of 64,720 skills. This is partly due to the lenient certification process, where developers can bypass the privacy policy requirement by collecting personal information through the conversational interface without declaring it. In Section 4.2.4, we identify skills that potentially lack a required privacy policy.

#### 4.1.2 Broken Links and Incorrect URLs
Not all provided privacy policy URLs lead to a valid page. We found 80 Google Actions and 1,755 Alexa skills with broken privacy policy URLs. Some URLs lead to other developers' privacy policies. For example, the skill "NORAD Tracks Santa" by NORAD links to Amazon’s privacy policy instead of a developer-specific one. The privacy policy URL of "Rubetek SmartHome" leads to the company’s homepage, promoting products rather than a privacy policy.

#### 4.1.3 Duplicate URLs
A significant portion of privacy policies share the same URLs. On Amazon Alexa, more than 56% of skills have duplicate privacy policy URLs. Out of 17,952 Amazon skills with privacy policies, 7,828 have unique URLs, while 10,124 (56.4%) share 1,206 different URLs. The most common URL (https://getstoryline.com/public/privacy.html) is shared by 1,783 skills (9.9%). On Google Assistant, 12.2% of actions have duplicate privacy policy URLs. Out of 1,967 actions, 1,728 have unique URLs, while 239 share 64 different URLs.

| Platform          | Duplicate Privacy Policy URLs                     | Total #   | Percentage |

To understand the prevalence of duplicate privacy policy URLs, especially on Amazon Alexa, we examined the developer information. Developers who published multiple voice-apps often use the same privacy policy URLs. For developers with more than one skill, 77% of their skills use duplicate privacy policy URLs. Table 5 lists the top 5 developers who published the most skills with a privacy policy on Amazon Alexa. For example, 2,064 out of 2,069 skills (99.8%) use duplicate privacy policy URLs. A serious issue arises if such a privacy policy link is broken, affecting hundreds of skills. For instance, the broken link "https://www.freshdigitalgroup.com/privacy-policy-for-bots" affects 217 skills. On Google Assistant, 27.5% of actions by developers with more than one action have duplicate privacy policy URLs. For the top 10 developers, 86% of their actions use a duplicate privacy policy link.

| Developer         | # of Skills Developed | % with Duplicate URLs |
|-------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| Patch.com         | 1,012                 | 99.8%                 |
| Radio.co          | 295                   | 99.8%                 |
| Tinbu LLC         | 264                   | 99.8%                 |
| FreshDigitalGroup | 259                   | 99.8%                 |
| Witlingo          | 259                   | 99.8%                 |

This analysis highlights the need for more stringent enforcement of privacy policy requirements and the importance of ensuring that privacy policies are specific to each voice-app.
