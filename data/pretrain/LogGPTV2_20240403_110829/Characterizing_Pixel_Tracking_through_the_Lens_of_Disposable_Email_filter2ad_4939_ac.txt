spam emails (5.2%) that contain at least one blacklisted URL.
Finally, we apply the same ISODATA clustering algorithm
to the rest of the spam emails (which count for 48.3%) to
identify spam campaigns. We ﬁnd 19,314 clusters and the top
500 clusters account for 75.6% of the spam emails. Manual
examination shows that
the top clusters indeed represent

Categories of Email Senders.
To understand what types
of online services users interact with, we further examine the
“categories” of email sender domains. The “categories” are
provided by VirusTotal. Table V shows the top 10 categories
for spam emails and account management emails. We have
two main observations.
First, the emails are sent from a very broad range of domain
categories. This suggests that users have used the disposable
email addresses to register accounts in all different types of
websites. There are in total 121 different categories, and the
top-10 categories only cover 51.01% of account management
emails and 58.25% of spam emails, which conﬁrms the high
diversity of usage. Second, we observe that disposable email
addresses are often used to register potentially sensitive ac-
counts. Categories such as “online social networks”, “ﬁnance”,
“shopping” have made the top-10 for account management
emails. This could introduce risks if a user accidentally
left PII or credit card information in the registered account.
Accounts registered under disposable email addresses are
easily hijackable. Any other users can take over the registered
accounts by sending a password-reset link to the disposable
email address, which will be publicly accessible. Given the
14,000+ password-reset emails in our dataset, it is possible
that malicious parties are already performing hijacking.
Case Studies: Common Usage.
Next, we use speciﬁc
examples to illustrate the common usage cases. Table IV
lists the top 5 email sending domains for registration, pass-
word reset and authentication emails. We show users use
disposable email addresses to register accounts in gaming
and social network services in order to enjoy the online ser-
vices without giving away real email addresses. For example,
facebookmail.com appears in the top-5 of all three types
of emails. twitter and miniclip (for gaming) also fall
into the same category. It is possible that some accounts are
fake accounts registered by spammers [58]. Since we decided
not to back-track (or login into) any individual user’s account
for ethical considerations, we cannot systematically differen-
tiate them. Previous research on anonymous community (e.g.,
4chan, Reddit) show that users prefer anonymized identiﬁers
when posting sensitive or controversial content [54], [33]. We
suspect normal users may use the disposable email address
to create such social media accounts for similar purposes.
PayPal accounts have additional risks. If a user accidentally
binds a real credit card to the account, it means any other users
may take over the PayPal account by resetting the password.
Another common use case is to obtain free goods. For
example, users often need to register an email address to
obtain demos or documents from software solutions and
educational services, e.g., axway.com, avendata.com,
retailio.in, and ssl.com. Users can also obtain a
discount code from shopping services (e.g., frys.com). An-
other common case (not in the top-5) is to use the disposable
email address to register for free WiFi in airports and hotels.
Finally, we observe cases (not in the top 5) where users try
to preserve anonymity: For example, people used disposable
email addresses to ﬁle anonymous complaints to the United
States Senate (86 emails).
Note that gmail.com is special: it turns out that many
small businesses cannot afford their own email domains and
directly use Gmail (e.g., PI:EMAIL). Thus, The
domain gmail.com does not represent Gmail, but is a col-
lection of small businesses. aol.com has a similar situation.
Case Studies: Risky Usage. We observe other cases that
may involve risks. These cases may be not as common as
those shown in Table IV, but if their accounts are hijacked
(through the public disposable email addresses), the real-world
consequences are more serious. For example, there are 4,000+
emails from healthcare.gov, the website of the Affordable
Care Act. It is likely that people have used disposable email
addresses to register their healthcare accounts where each
account carries sensitive information about the user.
Similarly, there are emails from mypersmail.af.mil
(Air Force Service Center), suggesting that people have used
disposable email address to register Air Force personnel ac-
counts. The registration is open to civilian employees who
must use their SSN and date of birth for the registration [1].
A password reset option is also available on the website.
In addition, more than 32,990 emails are used to receive
scanned documents from PDF scanning apps (e.g., Tiny Scan-

ner). It is possible for an attacker to obtain all the scanned
documents by hijacking these disposable email addresses.
Finally, there are over 1000 emails from digital currency or
digital wallet services such as buyabitcoin.com.au and
thebillioncoin.info. While most emails are related
to account registrations, some are related to bitcoin purchase
conﬁrmations (e.g., receipts). If these accounts hold bitcoins,
anyone has a chance to steal them.
D. Summary
We show that disposable email services are primarily used
to register online accounts. While most of the incoming emails
are spam and notiﬁcations (94%), we did ﬁnd a large number
of emails (89,000+) that are related to account registration,
password reset, and login authentication. There is a strong
evidence that users use disposable email services for sensitive
tasks. We ﬁnd 1000+ credit card numbers and 926 SSNs
accidentally revealed in the emails and 30K replied and
forwarded emails that indicate a personal usage. More im-
portantly, accounts registered with disposable email addresses
can be easily hijacked through a password reset.
V. EMAIL TRACKING MEASUREMENTS
Next, we use the large-scale email dataset to analyze email
tracking in the wild. We seek to answer three key questions.
First, what types of tracking techniques do trackers use in
practice, and what is the nature of the data leaked through
tracking. Second, how prevalent is third-party tracking among
different types of online services? Third, who are the top
trackers in the tracking ecosystem and how dominant are they?
In the following, we ﬁrst describe the threat model and our
method to detect third-party tracking, and then present the
measurement results.
A. Threat Model
By embedding a small image in the email body, the email
sender or third-parties can know whether the email has been
opened by the receiver. When an email is opened, the tracking
pixel will be automatically loaded from a remote server via
HTTP/HTTPS (which does not require any user actions).
Based on the request, the remote server will know who (based
on the email address or other identiﬁers) opened the email
at what location (based on IP) and what time (timestamp)
using what device (“User-Agent”). The privacy leakage is
more serious when the remote server is a third-party.
Email tracking works only if the user’s email client accepts
HTML-based email content, which is true for most modern
email clients. However, careful users may use ad-blockers
to block tracking pixels [17]. In this paper, we make no
assumption about a user’s email client, and only focus on
the tracking content in the email body. Note that JavaScript
is not relevant to email tracking since JavaScript will not be
automatically executed [4]. Alternatively, email tracking can
be done through querying font ﬁles. We did not ﬁnd any font-
based tracking in our dataset and omit it from the threat model.
B. Tracking Detection Method
Given an email, we design a method to determine if
the email contains tracking pixels. First, we survey popular
email tracking services (selected through Google searching) to
examine how they implement the tracking pixels. After analyz-
ing Yesware, Contact Monkey, Mailtrack, Bananatag, Streak,
MailTracker, The Top Inbox, and Hub Spot, we observe two
common characteristics. First, all 8 services embed small or
transparent HTML image tags that are not visible to users (to
remain stealthy). Second, the image URLs often contain some
form of user identiﬁers (either the receiver’s email address
or IDs created by the tracking services). This is because the
tracker wants to know “who” opened the email. Next, we
design a detection method based on these observations.
Steps to Detect Pixel Tracking.
Given an email, we ﬁrst
extract all the HTML image tags and corresponding URLs.
Here, we focus on tracking URLs that notify the tracker about
the user identity. We ﬁlter out links that do not contain any
parameters2. Then for each image URL, we follow the four
steps below to detect email tracking.
• Step 1: Plaintext Tracking Pixel: if the link’s parameters
contain the receiver’s email address in plaintext, then the
image is a tracking pixel.
• Step 2: Obfuscated Tracking Pixel: if the link’s param-
eters contain the “obfuscated version” of the receiver’s
email address, then the image is a tracking pixel. We
apply 31 hash/encoding functions on the receiver email
address to look for a match (see Appendix). We also
test two-layer obfuscations by exhaustively applying two-
function combinations, e.g., MD5(SHA1()). In total,
we examine 992 obfuscated strings for each address.
We didn’t consider salted obfuscation here due to the
extremely high testing complexity.
• Step 3: Invisible HTML Pixel: we check if the image
is trying to hide based on the HTML height and width
attributes. We consider the image as a tracking pixel if
both the height and width are below a threshold t or the
HTML tag is set to be “hidden” or “invisible”.
• Step 4: Invisible Remote Pixel: trackers may inten-
tionally set a large height or width in HTML to avoid
detection. If the HTML height or width is above t, we use
a web crawler to fetch the actual image from the remote
server. If the actual image size is below t, regardless the
HTML attributes, we regard it as a tracking pixel.
Step-1 and step-2 are adapted from the method described
in [17]. We explicitly look for parameters in the image URL
that leak the receiver’s email address. However, it is still
possible that trackers use an obfuscation method that is not
listed in Table XI (e.g., keyed-hash). More importantly, the
tracker can use a random string as the identiﬁer and keep
the mapping in the back-end. As such, we introduce step 3
and step 4 as a complementary way to capture the tracking
behavior that cannot be detected by [17].
2Image URLs without parameters will still reveal the user’s IP but are not
necessarily for tracking
