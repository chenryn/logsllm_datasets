I believe there is no reason why using layer interface user should not be able
to specify this. Output shape is not obvious for some cases (as stated here:
#2118) and without accepting output_shape argument one cannot match desired
output. Potential use case is trying to build autoencoder for 2d images in
form of (conv1->conv2->conv3->deconv1->deconv2->deconv3). With stride >1 there
is no way for doing this with layers interface right now.
