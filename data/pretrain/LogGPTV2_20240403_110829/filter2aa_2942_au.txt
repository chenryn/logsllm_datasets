COMPONENT AUTHENTICITY | ANTI-COUNTERFEIT SCANNING 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Enterprises should conduct anti-counterfeit scanning for critical 
components, at a minimum. Criticality analysis can help determine which components are critical and 
should be subjected to this scanning. See Section 2, Appendix C, and RA-9 for guidance on conducting

criticality analysis. The C-SCRM PMO can help identify critical components, especially those used by 
multiple missions, functions, and systems within an enterprise.

SR-12 COMPONENT DISPOSAL 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance:  IT security – in coordination with the C-SCRM PMO – can help 
establish appropriate component disposal policies, procedures, mechanisms, and techniques.

SR-13 SUPPLIER INVENTORY (NEW) 
Control: 
a. 
Develop, document, and maintain an inventory of suppliers that: 
1. Accurately and minimally reflects the organization’s tier one suppliers that may present a 
cybersecurity risk in the supply chain [Assignment: organization-defined parameters for 
determining tier one supply chain]; 
2. Is at the level of granularity deemed necessary for assessing criticality and supply chain risk, 
tracking, and reporting;  
3. Documents the following information for each tier one supplier (e.g., prime contractor): review 
and update supplier inventory [Assignment: enterprise-defined frequency]. 
i. 
Unique identify for procurement instrument (i.e., contract, task, or delivery order);  
ii. 
Description of the supplied products and/or services;  
iii. 
Program, project, and/or system that uses the supplier’s products and/or services; and 
iv. 
Assigned criticality level that aligns to the criticality of the program, project, and/or system 
(or component of system). 
b. Review and update the supplier inventory [Assignment: enterprise-defined frequency]. 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Enterprises rely on numerous suppliers to execute their missions and 
functions. Many suppliers provide products and services in support of multiple missions, functions, 
programs, projects, and systems. Some suppliers are more critical than others, based on the criticality of 
missions, functions, programs, projects, systems that their products and services support, and the 
enterprise’s level of dependency on the supplier. Enterprises should use criticality analysis to help 
determine which products and services are critical to determine the criticality of suppliers to be documented 
in the supplier inventory. See Section 2, Appendix C, and RA-9 for guidance on conducting criticality 
analysis.

APPENDIX B: C-SCRM CONTROL SUMMARY 
This appendix lists the C-SCRM controls in this publication and maps them to their 
corresponding [NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5] controls as appropriate. Table B-1 indicates those 
controls that are defined in [NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5]. Low baseline requirements are deemed to 
be relevant to C-SCRM. Some C-SCRM controls were added to this control set to form the C-
SCRM baseline. Additionally, controls that should flow down from prime contractors to their 
relevant sub-tier contractors are listed as Flow Down Controls. Given that C-SCRM is an 
enterprise-wide activity that requires the selection and implementation of controls at the 
enterprise, mission and business, and operational levels (Levels 1, 2, and 3 of the enterprise 
according to [NIST SP 800-39]), Table B-1 indicates the enterprise levels at which the controls 
should be implemented. C-SCRM controls and control enhancements not in [NIST SP 800-53, 
Rev. 5] are noted with an asterisk next to the control identifier, viz., MA-8 and SR-13.
