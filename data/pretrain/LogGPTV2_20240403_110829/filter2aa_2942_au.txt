### COMPONENT AUTHENTICITY | ANTI-COUNTERFEIT SCANNING

**Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance:**
Enterprises should, at a minimum, conduct anti-counterfeit scanning for critical components. A criticality analysis can help determine which components are essential and should undergo this scanning. For guidance on conducting criticality analysis, refer to Section 2, Appendix C, and RA-9 in NIST SP 800-161r1.

The C-SCRM Program Management Office (PMO) can assist in identifying critical components, especially those used across multiple missions, functions, and systems within the enterprise.

**Levels:** 2, 3  
**Related Controls:** RA-9

### SR-12 COMPONENT DISPOSAL

**Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance:**
IT security, in coordination with the C-SCRM PMO, should establish appropriate policies, procedures, mechanisms, and techniques for component disposal.

**Levels:** 2, 3

### SR-13 SUPPLIER INVENTORY (NEW)

**Control:**
a. Develop, document, and maintain an inventory of suppliers that:
   1. Accurately and minimally reflects the organization’s tier one suppliers that may present a cybersecurity risk in the supply chain [Assignment: organization-defined parameters for determining tier one supply chain].
   2. Is at the level of granularity necessary for assessing criticality and supply chain risk, tracking, and reporting.
   3. Documents the following information for each tier one supplier (e.g., prime contractor):
      - Unique identifier for procurement instrument (i.e., contract, task, or delivery order).
      - Description of the supplied products and/or services.
      - Program, project, and/or system that uses the supplier’s products and/or services.
      - Assigned criticality level that aligns with the criticality of the program, project, and/or system (or component of the system).

b. Review and update the supplier inventory [Assignment: enterprise-defined frequency].

**Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance:**
Enterprises rely on numerous suppliers to execute their missions and functions. Many suppliers provide products and services that support multiple missions, functions, programs, projects, and systems. Some suppliers are more critical than others, based on the criticality of the missions, functions, programs, projects, and systems they support, as well as the enterprise’s level of dependency on the supplier. Enterprises should use criticality analysis to determine which products and services are critical and to document the criticality of suppliers in the supplier inventory. For guidance on conducting criticality analysis, see Section 2, Appendix C, and RA-9 in NIST SP 800-161r1.

**Levels:** 2, 3  
**Related Controls:** RA-9

### APPENDIX B: C-SCRM CONTROL SUMMARY

This appendix lists the C-SCRM controls in this publication and maps them to their corresponding [NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5] controls. Table B-1 indicates those controls defined in [NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5] that are relevant to C-SCRM. Some C-SCRM controls were added to this control set to form the C-SCRM baseline. Additionally, controls that should flow down from prime contractors to their sub-tier contractors are listed as Flow Down Controls. Given that C-SCRM is an enterprise-wide activity requiring the selection and implementation of controls at the enterprise, mission and business, and operational levels (Levels 1, 2, and 3 according to [NIST SP 800-39]), Table B-1 indicates the enterprise levels at which the controls should be implemented. C-SCRM controls and control enhancements not in [NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5] are noted with an asterisk next to the control identifier, such as MA-8 and SR-13.
