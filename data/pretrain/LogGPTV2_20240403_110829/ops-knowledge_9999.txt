User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Secure way of sending a excel document to a third party? Looking to send an excel log file to a third party securely, any sensitive data will be obfuscated.

Initially was looking to use PGP but the third party does not have this and time is a constraint.

Was thinking of password protecting the excel file and sending this as normal email. What then would be a secure way of sending this password, either SMS or via a conference call which is not recorded?

Assistant: The appropriate level of security depends on the threats involved, so you to make some judgment calls. Password-protected Excel files have not been that secure in past versions and there are tools to break the older protections.

If you need a GUI-based, easy-to-use, Windows-based solution (I'm making assumptions), then many Windows file compression tools offer encryption (7zip is also a popular option and easy to use). You zip the file, then add encryption with a password. This process would protect the contents of the file but often exposes the file name (if that's a concern).

But you asked about sharing the password. The general idea is that you share the password through a different channel than the channel you used to share the file. So if you are emailing the file, you SMS or phone the recipient with the password, for example. This protects against someone who has access to the recipient's emails (or the email stream between you and the recipient) gaining both the file and the password.
