**Steps to Reproduce the Problem:**

1. Compile the following Go program:

```go
package sum

func sum(a []int) int {
    // returns an int
    s := 0;
    for i := 0; i < len(a); i++ {
        s += a[i];
    }
    return s;
}
```

**Summary:**
The issue is related to semicolons in the Go compiler (gc). The code provided includes unnecessary semicolons, which may cause unexpected behavior or compilation errors. 

**Expected Behavior:**
- The program should compile without errors.
- The `sum` function should correctly calculate and return the sum of the integers in the slice.

**Actual Behavior:**
- Compilation issues or runtime errors may occur due to the presence of semicolons.

**Notes:**
- Ensure that the Go compiler version is up-to-date.
- Review the use of semicolons in the code, as they are generally not required in Go unless used to separate statements on the same line.
