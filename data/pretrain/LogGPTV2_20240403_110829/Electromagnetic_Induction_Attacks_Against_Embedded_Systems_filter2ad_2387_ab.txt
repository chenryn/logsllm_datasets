To examine the spatial and temporal effects of H separately, allow
H = ˆy f (t)д(x) where f (t) = i(t) and д(x) = 1/(2πx). Given a
receiver surrounded by the surface S, and in the absence of other
receiving elements1, the voltage induced at the receiver, v, may be
1We note that the model serves as a first order approximation to explain the attack
mechanism. The attack effect will be dependent upon the environment; e.g., a different
orientation/angle of the attack field with respect to the receiver would lessen its efficacy,
as would the presence of other receiving circuitry as they could absorb power that
would be otherwise collected by the target. These negative effects, from the attacker’s
perspective, can be to some extent be minimized through properly directing the attack
field [6].

From (3) it is apparent that if the derivative of the attacker’s
current is zero mean then the voltage induced at the victim receiver
will also have zero mean. In the next section we discuss how embed-
ded systems are generally innately designed to produce a non-zero
mean signal, but also note that the proper selection of the attacker’s
current can also result in a non-zero mean voltage. For example, the
induction of DC voltages/currents could be accomplished through
the use of the integral of half or full-wave rectified currents, i.e.,
| sin(2π f t)|dt, where f is the frequency of the desired
attack signal. Additionally, because of the minus sign and derivative
in (3) there are two ways to induce a positive or negative voltage
(i.e., increase or decrease the apparent voltage of the sensor): em-
ploy a negative current with a positive slope, or positive current
with negative slope. Circuit-specific mechanisms for inducing a DC
voltage, which take advantage of protection circuitry common to
nearly all embedded systems, are discussed in Section 3.1.
For ease of exposition, the remainder of the paper will refer-
ence a lumped-element attack model. That is, at a circuit level, the
EM-based attack model can be viewed as two inductively coupled
circuits (Fig. 1c). The attacker is seen to be generating an attack
signal that through near-field interactions couples with the embed-
ded system (the transmitting circuitry can be wholly characterized
via its impedance, i.e., resistance, Ratk and inductance, Latk). The
strength of this coupling is denoted by the coupling coefficient, M.
Since a closed circuit, by definition, is a loop, it can act as a loop
antenna receiving an EM signal. Thus, the embedded system acts
as a receiver similarly characterized by an inductance, Lemb, resis-
tance, Remb, and capacitance, Cemb. The values of these elements

on, any wiring connecting the system to the sensor/actuator, and
the input/output impedance of the various components. What is
important to note is that resistance, inductance, and capacitance of
the embedded system (including sensor or actuator), in total, will
cause the system to respond more strongly to some frequencies of
IEMI than others.
2.3 Countermeasures
The most popular (physical) countermeasure against IEMI is RF
shielding. These types of shielding generally employ conductive
materials to eliminate coupled H and E fields or lone E fields and
are effective, in the coupled case, against interference on the order
of MHz, and down to static fields for lone E fields. However, in our
IEMI attacks the magnetic near field is used to induce attack voltage
waveforms on the target and in the near field the H and E fields
are decoupled, thus conductive materials are insufficient to shield
against our attack field [1]. That is, while shielding a cable may
protect against capacitive E-field coupling or far-field radiation (as
in [19]), applying magnetic fields to the loop area of the cable will
still result in the generation of interfering voltage values.
While magnetic shielding, in the form of ferrimagnetic materials
with high permeability, are available [31], magnetically shielding
a system is generally not considered because of weight, cost, and
complexity considerations (achieving effective shielding at the fre-
quencies of interest is difficult in practice [29]), especially when
we consider low-cost analog, digital and actuation systems. Indeed,
shielding the overall system might not even be possible as it would
prevent the sensor from operating; e.g., while a light sensor can
function in a mesh-based Faraday cage, magnetic shielding would
prevent light from reaching the sensor. Similarly, using low-pass
filtering on system inputs is generally insufficient in practice as tra-
ditional filter elements have parasitic components that turn them
into band-stop filters at higher frequencies[16]; even the use of
specialized EMI filters requires great cost and effort to achieve
immunity [14].
3 FALSE-DATA INJECTION FOR ANALOG
SENSORS
Analog to Digital Converters (ADCs) perform the function of digi-
tizing voltage or current signals (i.e., they output a digital code that
corresponds to the voltage/current). An ADC serves as a bridge
between the analog and digital world and is the primary method by
which sensor data is obtained in embedded systems, as most sensors
generate current or voltage as a representation of a particular real
world quantity [33]. Typically, sensor information is secured only
after digitization; thus, by manipulating the signal measured by the
ADC an attacker would be able to bypass most common measures
to ensure data integrity.
In this section we illustrate our attack on a light sensor (specifi-
cally a photodiode that responds to IR radiation) as it outputs an,
essentially, DC signal in the range of a few volts, which can be
taken as representative of many sensors used in embedded systems.
In addition, light sensors are widely used to control the charging
and discharging of solar energy harvesting systems. Injecting false
data into such a system could lead a controller to assume that there
is more/less energy available than there actually is, which could
result in over taxation of resources and premature shutdown.
3.1 Mechanism of Attack
The simplest IEMI attack on an analog sensor would involve an
attacker transmitting a narrow-band sinusoidal signal, which in
turn would induce an AC voltage on a victim circuit. While it may
be counter-intuitive to induce AC voltage on a victim circuit which
reads DC voltages, it is possible to convert the AC signal into an
DC voltage. This is due to the non-linearity present at the input
terminals of a microcontroller’s input circuitry. Specifically, the non-
linearity arises due to Electro-Static Discharge (ESD) protection
circuits that shunt damaging high currents caused by ESD and pre-
vent ADCs from being exposed to over-/under-voltage [10, 22]. In
the simplest case these protection circuits are designed with diodes
(Fig. 2a), which would short-circuit a large positive or negative
ESD-current onto the positive supply or ground node, respectively
[30]. They also limit the voltages the ADC is exposed to an allow-
able range, as seen in Fig. 2b2. This effect introduces signal clipping
on an attacker-induced AC signal, while performing the analog to
digital conversion. This would create a scenario in which the AC
signal components, close to the maximum or minimum allowed
voltages of the ADC, be assigned digital values corresponding to
the maximum or minimum allowed voltage, thus rectifying the
induced AC signal with a non-zero DC component (Fig. 2b). The
ADC used in our work3 has a input voltage range from 0 V to 3.3 V.
Thus, any input signal above 3.3 V would be considered equal to
3.3 V by the ADC, while vice versa is true for signals below 0 V.
Fig. 2c shows the maximum deviation of ADC output voltage
due to these clipping effects, while performing an IEMI attack using
a sinusoidal signal. Vact represents the input signal to an ADC from
a sensor, while Vm represents the ADC output voltage as a result
of input signal as well as presence of an IEMI attack sinusoidal
signal with an peak voltage amplitude of A. The y-axis indicates the
difference between actual sensor output and the measured sensor
output due to the IEMI.
3.2 Experimental Setup
Fig. 3 shows the experimental setup used for performing an IEMI
attack on an analog sensor. An IR sensor was connected to an ADC
present in a microcontroller as the target circuitry for the attack.
The following sections describe each part of the experimental setup.
3.2.1 Target Circuitry. The attacker attempts to manipulate sen-
sor data of a victim circuitry consisting a single infra-red (IR) optical
sensor SFH235 [32], a 330 kΩ resistor and an ADC present in the
Tiva C microcontroller (TM4C123GXL from Texas instrument) [40]
is assumed for this attack (Fig. 1a). The SFH235 sensor was reverse
biased by a 5 V DC voltage source V(reverse). The sensor generates
a current depending on the IR illumination level and this current
results a voltage across the 330 kΩ resistor [23]. A 12 bit ADC is
2For ease of exposition, we have ignored the threshold voltage of the diodes; actual
saturation levels would be +/− the threshold voltage of the diodes (typically 0.7 V)
unless supply levels were modified to account for this drop.
3A slightly different ESD protection method is used by our microcontroller [40]; its
effects are equivalent to the clipping discussed above.

of 1.5 mm is preferred as a substrate. The conductor is a copper
with 35 µm thickness. The planar size of the antenna is 35 cm-by-30
cm. The broadband capability of the Vivaldi antenna enables the
attacker to change the attack signal’s frequency and find the most
efficient frequency to have a successful coupling of EM signal onto
the victim circuit.
3.3 Experimental Results and Discussion
The effects of the attack for several attack and system configurations
are discussed.
3.3.1
IEMI attack under different IR illumination levels. The Vi-
valdi antenna was placed at 10 cm from the victim circuit to estimate
the effectiveness of this attack at close proximity. The experiment
was conducted with three different IR illumination levels namely,
no illumination, medium illumination and high illumination levels.
No illumination condition represents the absence of any explicit IR
source present near the victim circuit, while the medium and high
illumination levels represents the conditions in which the ADC
present in the victim circuit reads close to 1.5 V (nearly half of the
maximum value the ADC could read) and 3.3 V (maximum value
that the ADC could read), respectively. These conditions would
help determine the effects of DC offset, generated from the IR sen-
sor, during an attack with EM signal. An IR lamp with 5 W output
power, operating at 850 nm, was used to provide IR illumination.
Figs. 4a, 4b, and 4c show the ADC output with respect to varying
frequency of the attacking EM signal, under different levels of IR
illumination. These figures summarize results from three different
attempts to determine the consistency of the output from the ADC.
Variations in the ADC input voltage from the nominal values of
0 V, 1.5 V and 3.3 V arises due to the ESD protection mechanism
which limits the signal measured by the ADC (but not received at
the microcontroller input pins). The frequency at which maximum
EM induction happens can be attributed to the resonant frequency
of the victim circuit.
Under high and no illumination conditions, a DC signal is gen-
erated by signal clipping: in the case of no illumination the lower
portion of the induced sinusoid was eliminated (resulting in a posi-
tive DC voltage) while in the case of high illumination the upper
portion was eliminated (resulting in a negative DC voltage). That
is, under the high illumination condition the input DC voltage gen-
erated by the photodiode was close to 3.3 V; as the ADC can only

used to sample Vadc, which was generated at the 330 kΩ resistor,
at a sampling rate of 1 mega sample per second (MSPS).
3.2.2 Attacker Circuitry. The signal generator used for this ex-
periment was a HP8350B. The output of the signal generator was
connected to an RF power amplifier ZHL-1A from Mini Circuits,
which can operate in the frequency range 2 MHz–500 MHz. The
power amplifier was biased using a +24 V DC voltage from an
HP-E3631A DC power supply. The power amplifier can handle a
maximum input power of +20 dBm (100 mW) without experiencing
any non-linearity. Hence, the signal generator was made to gener-
ate +20 dBm output power, which was connected to the input of
the power amplifier. The output power from the power amplifier
with 20 dBm input power was computed by connecting its output
to a spectrum analyzer as 32.6 dBm (1.82 W). In the experiment
described in this section, the power amplifier was made to generate
32.6 dBm output power between 2 MHz to 500 MHz. Beyond this
frequency range, there will be a drop in output power from the
power amplifier due to non-linearity.
When the targets are analog devices like an electrocardiogram
(ECG), which measure low power voltage values (around 1 mV) at
low frequencies (up to 1 MHz), antennas like whip monopoles can
be used to attack such victim circuits [19]. However, the capability
of such kind of antennas for our application is limited because of
