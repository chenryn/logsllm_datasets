    function Component({reportType}) {
      let Report = Reports[reportType];
      let child = useMemo(() => {
        return ;
      }, [Report]);
says that `Report` is an unnecessary dependency. It's not.
This is because eslint scope `.references` does not include JSX. I _suspect_
if you pull in
https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react/blob/master/lib/rules/jsx-
uses-vars.js
to your app's config then this won't happen. But maybe we should do something
in the Hooks plugin itself too (since the others aren't officially recommended
by the React team anyway).
