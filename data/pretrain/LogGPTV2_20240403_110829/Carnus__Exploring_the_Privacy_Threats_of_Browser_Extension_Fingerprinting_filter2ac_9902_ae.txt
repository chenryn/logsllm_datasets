from a privacy perspective, there are, however, other categories
that reveal more personal information. In Figure 5 we present
the main such categories and distinguish between those that
reveal important but non-sensitive information (e.g., the user’s
interests) and those that reveal sensitive information such as a
user’s health conditions, religion and political views.
For instance, in the Health category we can ﬁnd extensions
such as UUID: knijgomkfcdigmbogcnffcbfgmapmkca,
which is designed to assist people with dyslexia, and UUID:
edmpbiamnlgdichailkadlagmbklhbpk, which allows users
to compare their own images to visually similar skin cancer
images on the web. In the Religion category there are exten-
sions like UUID: ndmbeogingkjkmmkoomnigifmpajmbkc
and UUID: apkkllhahggfkhfdlmpopcncnaiclfdm, which
expose the user’s religion.
Our classiﬁcation results in assigning 838 extensions to the
Jobs & Education category, which is the most prominent one,
and 46 to the Family & Relationships category, which is the
least common one among the less-sensitive categories. For the
most sensitive categories of News/Politics, Health and Religion
our classiﬁcation results in 238, 121 and 105, respectively (the
list of extensions in these categories is available online [5]). To
assess the accuracy of the classiﬁcation we randomly chose 50
extensions from each one of the three sensitive categories, and
manually checked if they were assigned to the correct category
or not. Through this manual process we found the accuracy of
the classiﬁcation to be 100%, 86% and 80% for the respective
categories of News/Politics, Health and Religion.
Ethnicity inference. Next we analyze our ﬁngerprintable
extensions and calculate the Shannon-Weiner index (SWI) of
the ethnicities inferred based on the names of the reviewers.
Since this index incorporates both the richness and evenness
of the population (i.e., reviewers’ ethnicities), we found that
for extensions with a fair number of reviews, a threshold of
3.5 is sufﬁcient to indicate whether an ethnicity is prevalent;
in practice attackers can ﬁne-tune this threshold based on their
11
100101102103Jobs & EducationBeauty & FashionSportsHobbies & LeisureTravelFamily & RelationshipsNews/PoliticsHealthReligionExtensionsCategoriesInterests/preferencesSensitive informationrequirements. Our analysis shows that this technique can iden-
tify 12,754 (43.33%) extensions with a prevailing ethnicity. To
further increase our conﬁdence, if we only consider extensions
that have been installed by at least 500 users and have reviews
by at least 20 different users, 2,593 extensions can be used for
this type of inference.
As this approach is topic agnostic,
i.e., does not rely
on the extensions’ description or type functionality, it en-
ables the inference of information that is well hidden and,
practically, unavailable. For example, the “FlashSaleTricks”
extension (UUID: bboalniaekhennojedffbbjlokcpbjgn )
has a Shannon-Weiner index of 2.62. The language of that
extension, and the text of its description, is English, but Indian
names are predominant in its reviews. By checking its website
(https://www.ﬂashsaletricks.com/) we found that it indeed tar-
gets Indian users. An interesting case is that of the “Download
Master” (UUID: dljdacfojgikogldjffnkdcielnklkce),
which appears to be popular among Russian users (SWI=3.47).
While this extension is in English, we found that upon in-
stallation it downloads additional software that is in Russian.
Similarly, while the description of the “J2TEAM Security”
extension (UUID: hmlcjjclebjnfohgmgikjfnbmfkigocc)
is in English, the majority of its reviewers are Vietnamese
(SWI=3.21). In another example, the “wanteeed” extension
(UUID: emnoomldgleagdjapdeckpmebokijail), with an
index of 3.29, is shopping-related and is popular with French
predominantly female users (2.9x more female names).
Sensitive information inference. To further understand
what type of information can be inferred from the presence
of speciﬁc extensions, and which extensions reveal such in-
formation in practice, we investigate whether the languages of
an extension can be used for characterizing the user. To that
end, we collected the languages that are supported by each
extension from the Chrome Web Store. We ﬁnd that 24,392
(82.88%) of the extensions only support a single language,
and that 5,425 of them (18.43% of detectable extensions) are
in a language different from English while 4,623 (15.7%) have
English (United States) as their language. Moreover, for exten-
sions that support multiple languages we ﬁnd that 1,747 out of
4,983 support 4 or less languages. Extensions with an extensive
list of languages cannot, in practice, provide any insights about
the user. Finally, apart from the extensions’ languages that are
listed in the Web Store, 3,922 (13.32%) extensions have a
description in a language other than English, which indicates
that those extensions target a speciﬁc language-speaking popu-
lation. While extensions that are exclusively in English cannot
be used for determining the origin of the user, most of the
other languages can provide strong indications about the user’s
ethnicity, country or residence/origin. Our analysis identiﬁed
a total of 7,552 (25.66%) non-English extensions that reveal
the language of the user.
To further explore what sensitive information can be in-
ferred from extensions, we conduct a more in-depth analysis
on the extensions’ description text. First, we use spaCy’s
Named Entity Recognition (NER) [20] to identify entities in
the extensions’ description that expose information regarding
the user’s location, nationality or language. Next, we compile
a comprehensive list of mappings between countries and
ethnicities, from online sources, and use it to automatically
cross-match and verify that the inferred information indeed
refers to locations and nationalities. By matching the detected
entities with the ethnicities and countries in our list, we were
able to automatically verify 1,945 extensions. Since our list
does not contain region/city names, we manually inspected
the remaining entities and found 315 additional extensions
with descriptions that include information that could reveal
the user’s location or nationality. However, in our analysis
we do not consider any entities that can reveal information
but require region-speciﬁc knowledge by the attacker (e.g.,
UUID: cgdogkoldofookodmiipcakaejpgocgc). In total,
this approach led to the identiﬁcation of 2,260 extensions.
Next, by using our name-lists we map the names of the
reviewers of each extension to their gender, and calculate the
percentage between male and female. We ﬁnd that for 1,448
extensions the percentage of one gender over the other exceeds
80%, which in many cases is sufﬁcient to determine the gender
of the users that have the extension installed in their browser.
Since Google’s API cannot classify all
the detectable
extensions, as some of them have a very short description text,
we opt for another approach that could identify extensions that
reveal sensitive information. Thus, we use publicly available
wordlists [17] of religious and medical terms, and search for
those terms in the extensions’ description text. For this task
we ﬁrst discard certain terms in the wordlists’ terms that are
generic or have multiple meanings (i.e., the terms virus and
infection have a different meaning in the context of the Web),
as they could lead to many false positives. This straightforward
approach of matching terms returned 73 extensions that are
related to religion and 70 that are health related. We manually
inspected these extensions and found that indeed 58 (79.45%)
of the former ones reveal the user’s religion. For the latter we
found that 62 extensions are related to health (88.57%) and that
49 of these (70%) reveal health conditions. The remaining 13
extensions are for physicians or web developers (e.g., to help
them build websites that are suitable for colorblind users).
We also created a wordlist with political terms and used it
to identify extensions that could possibly reveal the political
inclination of the user. Intentionally, we keep this wordlist
short, only containing terms that clearly refer to politics (such
as Democrats, Republicans, Liberals, Conservatives, Donald
Trump, Hillary Clinton, Obama, UKIP, Brexit, etc.). With
this wordlist we matched 340 extensions, and though manual
inspection we found that indeed 323 (95%) are related to
politics and that 307 of them (90.29%) provide insights about
the user’s political inclination.
Overall statistics. To have a more complete view regarding
the extensions that reveal sensitive information about politics,
health and religion, we combine the results of the classiﬁcation
with the results of the wordlist-based approach (only the
extensions that we manually veriﬁed as TPs from the wordlist-
based approach) This results in 387, 147 and 116 extensions
that reveal information about the user’s political inclination,
health and religion, respectively. Furthermore, we ﬁnd that
these extensions have been installed 406,869, 1,177,573, and
885,923, times respectively, highlighting the extent of this
signiﬁcant privacy threat. If we consider all the categories from
Figure 5, since even less sensitive categories are useful for
privacy-invasive practices like targeted advertising, the total
number of installations exceeds 59 million.

size, and the corresponding size of the anonymity crowd.
Furthermore, when considering all the above approaches
for the inference of sensitive user information, from the name-
based ethnicity and gender inference to the identiﬁcation of
the user’s language, religion, political inclination etc., we ﬁnd
that 18,286 (62.13%) of the detectable extensions reveal such
pieces of sensitive information. 15,996 of all these extensions
can be identiﬁed through WAR and 14,042 of them cannot
be identiﬁed through other techniques. Behavior-based ﬁnger-
prints can identify 3,879 such extensions, of which 1,916 are
not detectable otherwise. Lastly, 617 and 240 extensions can be
identiﬁed through inter- and intra-communication ﬁngerprints,
and 134 and 52 cannot be detected by other means.
De-anonymization attack. Next we focus on the unique-
ness of ﬁngerprintable extensions for quantifying their suitabil-
ity for identifying users solely based on their set of extensions.
While prior studies explored how users could be uniquely
tracked within an anonymous crowd, we demonstrate a more
powerful attack that can infer the reviewer’s name based on
the uniqueness of their set of extensions. For our analysis we
only use eponymous reviews, which also include a unique user
ID – this removes the obstacle of users with identical names
(the number of reviews per user in our dataset is presented in
Figure 6). While we do not attempt to actually de-anonymize
any users, in practice attackers could use the name and proﬁle
picture to discover even more information about the user [37].
Users can also be trivially matched to their reviews in other
Google services (e.g., business, restaurants, etc.) which can
lead to the inference of additional personal data. We want to
emphasize that our de-anonymization attack is, obviously, only
applicable to users that have written reviews for extensions;
for other users the attacker would be limited to anonymous
tracking as in prior studies.
We implement the unicity formula proposed by Achara et
al. for calculating the uniqueness of smartphone apps [9], and
use it to calculate the probability that a randomly selected
subset of extensions with cardinality K is unique within our
dataset of users. Prior work [52] reported that users had an
average of 4.81 extensions, so we calculate the unicity for
cardinality values of K = 1, . . . 10, as shown in Figure 7.
Surprisingly, we ﬁnd that even when an attacker is able to
only detect 2 extensions in a user’s browser, there is a 77.5%
chance of uniquely identifying the user within a set of almost
84 thousand users. As one would expect, as the cardinality
increases so does the probability of uniquely identifying the
user. When assuming that 4 extensions have been detected,
9,286 users are candidate targets with a 94.5% probability of
being uniquely identiﬁable. When comparing to the numbers
reported in [24] we ﬁnd that our unicity results are higher for
K < 4, which can be attributed to the signiﬁcantly larger
number of users in our study. In practice, the number of
extensions installed per user will likely be higher than their
number of reviews (i.e., users are unlikely to write a review for
all their extensions) which could further increase their unicity.
Nonetheless, due to our larger number of users and larger set
of detectable extensions, we believe that our study offers a
more accurate representation of the discriminatory power of
browser extensions. Our ﬁndings also highlight the signiﬁcant
privacy risk that any type of public data can introduce, even
something as innocuous as extension reviews.
VII. DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK
Ethical considerations. The techniques presented in this
paper present a severe privacy risk to users. However, it is
important to note that we do not actually run our attacks against
any users. Our attacks are based on the analysis of extension
characteristics and our goal is to explore what sensitive infor-
mation can be inferred from the presence of such extensions.
During our experiments we did not attempt to correlate any
extracted traits/characteristics to users. Furthermore, the review
analysis process relies on aggregate statistics regarding names
collected from publicly available reviews from Chrome’s Web
Store. The unicity measurements leverage reviewers’ unique
IDs for associating users with installed extensions, and does
not take into account or get correlated to any actual user infor-
mation. We have deleted all collected reviews after running our
experiments. We believe that our ﬁndings provide signiﬁcant
additional incentives for browser vendors to adopt defenses
that have been recently proposed by the research community.
Apart from extension enumeration techniques enhancing the
uniqueness of a browser’s ﬁngerprint, our inference techniques
mandate a reassessment of the extension ecosystem and the
threat it poses to users, and motivate a more cautious approach
to installing extensions.
Countermeasures. As demonstrated by our experimental
evaluation, the countermeasure proposed by Trickel et al. [55]
is ineffective against
the vast majority of our behavioral
ﬁngerprints. Two other studies [46], [50] recently proposed
whitelist-based countermeasures for mediating access between
extensions and web pages, and a similar approach has been
announced by Chrome [6]. These mechanisms can potentially
reduce the ﬁngerprint surface exposed to certain domains,

attacks we demonstrated. While giving more control to users
is a positive development, site-blocking mechanisms that rely
on user conﬁgurations for setting policies can lead to user
confusion [35] and may be too challenging for average users.
Nonetheless, while more research is needed to fully prevent ex-
tension ﬁngerprinting attacks, we believe that these approaches
are important steps towards better protecting users and should
be incorporated by browsers. While designing an effective
countermeasure is out of the scope of this work, we believe
that a technique that introduces innocuous (or imperceptible
to the user) behavioral activity that results in the behavioral
ﬁngerprints of extensions resembling the ﬁngerprints of other
extensions is an interesting future direction.
Classiﬁcation and information extraction. We mainly
rely on the description text of the extensions for identifying
each extension’s topic and the sensitive information that can
be possibly inferred. However, since there are no guidelines
mandating the content and structure of the descriptions, these
are determined solely by the developer of the extensions and
are typically very inconsistent. Even though we developed a
pre-processing method, we cannot remove all text that can
possibly affect our classiﬁcation results. As such, we plan
to investigate more advanced techniques for identifying the
relevant content, extracting the topic, and inferring sensitive
user information (e.g., machine learning classiﬁers that take
all extensions into account and detect more complex patterns).
Supplementary identity sources. We demonstrated how
attackers could leverage extension reviews as a potential source
for inferring a user’s identity. In practice, users leave behind an
abundance of digital “breadcrumbs” that result in privacy loss.
These can be correlated [22] to further amplify the attack’s
effect. An adversary could also potentially augment the dataset
of user reviews with reviews from other domains, namely
mobile apps. By automatically mapping speciﬁc browser ex-
tensions to the corresponding mobile apps (e.g., the Skype
Chrome extension to the Skype Android app) an attacker can
use the additional reviews from other platforms to create more
complete user proﬁles. Apart from using the name and images
as identiﬁers, stylometric techniques [11], [43] can be used for
correlating users across platforms.
Review analysis. During our inference attack analysis all
available reviewers are considered as part of the user set for
each extension regardless of the score that they have assigned.
This provides a lower bound estimation of unicity as it could
inﬂate the size of the user sets, which reduces the “uniqueness”
of that extension. A more conservative approach is to use a
heuristic based on the review score for assigning a user to
the set of users that have installed that extension. However,
users that have given a low rating may still continue to use
that extension. As such, we plan to explore more sophisticated
NLP-based techniques for identifying cases where users im-
plicitly reveal that they have uninstalled a given extension.
VIII. RELATED WORK
Browser ﬁngerprinting [18] has garnered signiﬁcant at-
tention from the research community, and prior work has
demonstrated the feasibility of several techniques that focus
on different browser aspects of the browser and underlying
hardware [13], [33], [40], [41]. More recently several studies
have focused on the ﬁngerprintability of browser extensions,
