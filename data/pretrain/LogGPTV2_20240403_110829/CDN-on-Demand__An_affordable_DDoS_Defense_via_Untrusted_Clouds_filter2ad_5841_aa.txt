## Abstract
We present CDN-on-Demand, a software-based defense that administrators of small to medium-sized websites can install to resist powerful DDoS attacks at a fraction of the cost of comparable commercial CDN services. When excessive load is detected, CDN-on-Demand serves clients from a scalable set of proxies automatically deployed across multiple IaaS cloud providers. To minimize costs, it can use less expensive and less trusted clouds, facilitated by a new mechanism called clientless secure-objects. This mechanism ensures security without requiring private keys or user data to be stored on untrusted hosts, and it does not necessitate the installation of new client programs. Additionally, CDN-on-Demon introduces the origin-connectivity mechanism, which ensures essential communication with the content-origin remains possible even during severe DoS attacks.

A key feature of CDN-on-Demand is its ease of deployment. The origin-gateway module deploys CDN-on-Demand automatically and transparently, without requiring changes to web server configuration or website content. We have implemented CDN-on-Demand and evaluated each component as well as the complete system.

## 1. Introduction
Providing efficient and Denial-of-Service (DoS) resilient web services has become a critical goal for many websites. This goal is challenged by the unpredictability of content demand, including the 'flash crowds' phenomenon, and by increasingly powerful DoS attacks. One popular approach to address this issue is to outsource content distribution to a Content Delivery Network (CDN). CDNs deploy servers in various locations, host website proxies, distribute computational and storage resources, and deliver content from nearby servers. They use mechanisms like web-caches and traffic filters to provide scalable and robust services, which help mitigate flooding DoS attacks.

However, for smaller sites, the cost of a CDN service can be prohibitive. Despite their benefits, CDNs are less popular among small and medium-sized websites. Figure 1 shows the usage distribution of commercial CDN providers among the 32,000 most popular websites (according to Alexa's website-popularity rank [5]). The figure confirms that most websites do not use CDNs, and usage declines for less-popular sites. Larger organizations often use their own infrastructure instead of an external CDN provider.

One reason for the limited use of CDNs is that smaller organizations may not afford them on a regular basis, especially when not under attack. Temporarily migrating to a CDN introduces substantial administrative effort and financial costs. The CDN market is dominated by a few providers, leading to higher costs due to reduced competition.

CDN-on-Demand offers an alternative approach for DoS-resiliency, particularly suitable for small and medium-sized websites. It is a software-based defense that automatically handles flash crowds and thwarts DoS attacks by managing flexible cloud resources. Its open design allows for careful study and improvement of security, resiliency, and performance properties, rather than relying on hard-to-validate claims of full-service providers using proprietary mechanisms. Websites can tailor the system to their specific needs, ensuring the same host is not shared with an attacker, thus mitigating side-channel attacks.

### 1.1 Clientless Secure-Objects
Clientless secure-objects complement TLS/SSL by providing security at the HTTP object level. Each protected object is individually encapsulated (authenticated and, if needed, encrypted). Our design does not require changes to browsers and is readily deployable with today’s websites. To support this mechanism without client modifications, our implementation uses a JavaScript agent that clients automatically download from the content-origin during their first connection to the website. This allows CDN-on-Demand to utilize cheaper, untrusted providers and switch between them to optimize costs, while avoiding the need to share the site’s private key or certificate.

### 1.2 Ensuring Content-Origin Connectivity
CDNs offer several effective defenses against DoS. One basic defense is that most of the website’s content is static and cached by the CDN, making it difficult to attack. CDN-on-Demand leverages the robust connectivity and distributed infrastructure of IaaS cloud providers to efficiently deliver content. When necessary, such as during a DoS attack, it scales up by using more proxy servers in the cloud to ensure good service.

However, some HTTP requests require communication with the content-origin, e.g., to support dynamic content or update web-objects stored on proxies. Such 'origin-bound requests' are vulnerable to additional DoS attacks. Current CDN defenses include allowing only traffic between the CDN and content-origin and using a secret, hidden IP address. These defenses are often expensive and not always available, especially for smaller websites. CDN-on-Demand includes the origin-connectivity mechanism, which ensures the content-origin remains reachable despite severe DDoS attacks. It establishes a clogging-resilient tunnel between the content-origin and the proxies, using efficient whitelist filtering and redundant coding to facilitate loss-tolerant communication.

### 1.3 Cost Comparison
To distribute content in the face of strong DoS attacks, CDN-on-Demand deploys proxy servers on multiple IaaS cloud providers, optimizing resource use to minimize expenses. Figure 2 compares the monthly costs of CDN-on-Demand with several CDNs, including both widely-known and relatively inexpensive ones. The figure also compares the cost of deploying CDN-on-Demand using well-known, reputable clouds (EC2 and GCE) to costs using less-known providers (ProfitBricks and VirtualServer). CDN-on-Demand costs are significantly lower, and using less-expensive providers can further reduce costs by over half.

### 1.4 Reducing Trust in CDN Proxies
Currently, the only content-security mechanism available using standard web clients is HTTPS (i.e., SSL/TLS), which secures the communication channel between clients and proxies but leaves the proxy with complete access to the content. Liang et al. [24] show that supporting HTTPS connections with CDNs presents challenges. In one option, the website shares its private key with the CDN, making it difficult to switch providers. In the other option, a certification authority issues a certificate to the CDN, which is also problematic as revoking the certificate can be challenging. CDN-on-Demand addresses these concerns by protecting website content using clientless secure-objects, thereby reducing trust in CDN proxies.

## 2. System Overview
This section provides an overview of CDN-on-Demand’s design. We first describe the system's properties, then illustrate the deployment scenario, and finally, explain the bootstrap mechanism that facilitates its 'on-demand' property.

### 2.1 Properties
- **Robustness to DoS Attacks**: CDN-on-Demand ensures the availability of all website content even under severe DoS attacks, particularly bandwidth-DoS attacks.
- **Secure Use of Untrusted Providers**: To maximize flexibility and reduce costs, CDN-on-Demand deploys across multiple low-cost IaaS-cloud providers, ensuring content security against rogue providers or compromised cloud machines.
- **Efficient Resource Utilization**: CDN-on-Demand minimizes overhead and costs when the website is not under attack or handling a flash-crowd. When the load on the content-origin server is high, it automatically allocates resources to maintain service quality.

### 2.2 Deployment Scenario
The deployment scenario involves the following components:
- **Origin-Gateway Module**: Automatically and transparently deploys CDN-on-Demand without changing web server configurations or website content.
- **Manager Servers**: Monitor the performance of the content-origin and deploy proxies on IaaS clouds when necessary.
- **Clogging-Resilient Tunnel**: Ensures communication between the content-origin and proxies remains possible, supporting dynamic content, updates, and clientless secure-objects.

### 2.3 Bootstrap Mechanism
The bootstrap mechanism facilitates the 'on-demand' property of CDN-on-Demand. When excessive load is detected, manager servers deploy proxies and modify the website’s DNS mapping to direct clients to these proxies. This ensures that the system can quickly scale up to handle increased traffic and DDoS attacks.

## 3. Conclusion
CDN-on-Demand provides an affordable and flexible solution for small to medium-sized websites to defend against DDoS attacks. By leveraging untrusted IaaS cloud providers and introducing innovative mechanisms like clientless secure-objects and origin-connectivity, it ensures robust and secure content delivery. The system’s open design and automatic deployment make it a practical and cost-effective alternative to traditional CDN services.
