# Summary of the New Feature/Enhancement
We propose adding an option called "Keep on Top" when creating or editing a zone. This feature would ensure that any window within this zone remains above all other windows, enhancing visibility and accessibility for users. Ideally, this functionality would be integrated directly into the Windows operating system.

# Proposed Technical Implementation Details (Optional)
To implement this feature, the following steps could be considered:

1. **User Interface Update**: Add a checkbox or toggle labeled "Keep on Top" in the zone creation and editing dialog.
2. **Window Management**: Modify the window management logic to prioritize windows in zones marked as "Keep on Top." This can be achieved by setting the appropriate window flags or using existing APIs to keep the windows always on top.
3. **Configuration Persistence**: Ensure that the "Keep on Top" setting is saved and applied consistently across user sessions and system restarts.
4. **User Experience**: Provide clear visual feedback to indicate which zones have the "Keep on Top" setting enabled, such as a distinct icon or color change in the zone's settings.

By integrating these changes, we can offer a more flexible and user-friendly window management experience.
