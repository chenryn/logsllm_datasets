**Title: The Next Generation of Windows Exploitation: Attacking the Common Log File System (CLFS)**

**Abstract:**

The Common Log File System (CLFS) is a high-performance, universal logging mechanism introduced in Windows Vista. In this session, we will delve into our research on CLFS, covering the following key areas:

1. **Attack Surface Analysis:**
   - We will outline the process of identifying and analyzing the attack surface of CLFS, highlighting potential vulnerabilities.

2. **Fuzzing and Vulnerability Discovery:**
   - We will discuss the design and implementation of targeted fuzzing techniques to uncover vulnerabilities within CLFS.
   - A specific vulnerability discovered during our research, which was prepared for the Tianfu Cup, will be presented.

3. **Exploitation Techniques:**
   - We will review historical exploitation methods and their limitations.
   - A new, universal exploit method will be disclosed, offering a more robust approach to exploiting vulnerabilities in CLFS.

4. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - We will demonstrate how to combine CLFS with the new exploitation methods to achieve complete privilege escalation, even under challenging conditions such as pool overflow vulnerabilities.

By the end of this session, attendees will gain a comprehensive understanding of the CLFS attack surface, the process of discovering and exploiting vulnerabilities, and the latest techniques for achieving privilege escalation in modern Windows environments.
