**ATT&CK ID:** T1018  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Remote System Discovery

Adversaries may attempt to identify other systems on the network by their IP addresses, hostnames, or other logical identifiers. This information can be used for lateral movement from the current system. While some remote access tools may include built-in functionality for this purpose, adversaries can also leverage native operating system utilities such as `ping` or `net view` (using NetBIOS) to discover remote systems.
