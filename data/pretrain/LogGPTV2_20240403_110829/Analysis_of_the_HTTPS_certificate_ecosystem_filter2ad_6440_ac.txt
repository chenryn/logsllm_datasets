identiﬁed. While DFN has provided a large number of interme-
diate authorities to German institutions, we ﬁnd no evidence that
any are being used inappropriately. However, as we will discuss in
Section 9, the attack surface of the certiﬁcate ecosystem could be
greatly reduced by limiting the scope of these signing certiﬁcates.
The largest commercial provider of intermediate certiﬁcates is
GTE CyberTrust Solutions, Inc., a subsidiary of Verizon Business,
which has provided intermediate signing certiﬁcates to 49 third-party
organizations ranging from Dell Inc. to Louisiana State University.
Comodo (under the name The USERTRUST Network) provided
intermediates to 42 organizations and GlobalSign to 20. We also
saw a number of commercial authorities that provided a smaller
number of certiﬁcates to seemingly unrelated entities. For exam-
ple, VeriSign, Inc. provided intermediates for Oracle, Symantec,
and the U.S. Government; SwissSign AG provided certiﬁcates for
Nestle, Trend Micro, and other Swiss companies; StartCom Ltd.
Figure 1: CDF of Scan Presence by Certiﬁcate — We performed
36 scans from 1/2013 to 3/2013. Here, we show the number of
scans in which each certiﬁcate was found. We note that over 30%
of self-signed certiﬁcates were only found in one scan.
Figure 2: CDF of Leaf Certiﬁcates by CA — We ﬁnd that 90% of
trusted certiﬁcates are signed by 5 CAs, are descendants of 4 root
certiﬁcates, and were signed by 40 intermediate certiﬁcates.
Figure 3: Validity Periods of Browser Trusted Certiﬁcates —
Trusted CA certs are being issued with validity periods as long as
40 years, far beyond the predicted security of the keys they contain.

Table 3: Types of Organizations with Signing Certiﬁcates — We found 1,832 valid browser-trusted signing certiﬁcates belonging to 683
organizations. We classiﬁed these organizations and ﬁnd that more than 80% of the organizations that control a signing certiﬁcate are not
commercial certiﬁcate authorities.

Table 4: Top Parent Companies — Major players such as Syman-
tec, GoDaddy, and Comodo have acquired smaller CAs, leading to
the 5 largest companies issuing 84.6% of all trusted certiﬁcates.
Table 5: Top Certiﬁcate Authorities — The top 10 commercial
certiﬁcate authorities control 92.4% of trusted certiﬁcates present in
our March 22, 2013 scan.
provided certiﬁcates for The City of Osmio, Inc. and WoSign, Inc;
QuoVadis Limited provided certiﬁcates for Migros and the Arab
Bank Switzerland Ltd.; Entrust.net provided signing certiﬁcates to
Disney, Experian PLC, and TDC Internet; and Equifax provided
intermediates to Google Inc. This is not a clandestine practice, and
several CAs advertise the sale of subordinate CA certiﬁcates.
Several corporations had a company authority in browser root
stores. Approximately 30 of the 149 certiﬁcates in the Mozilla
NSS root store belonged to institutions that we did not classify as
commercial CAs, including Visa, Wells Fargo, Deutsche Telekom
AG and the governments of France, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japan,
Spain, and the United States.
5.3 Distribution of Trust
While there are 683 organizations with the ability to sign browser-
trusted certiﬁcates, the distribution is heavily skewed towards a small
number of large commercial authorities in the United States. The
security community has previously expressed concern over the sheer
number of signing certiﬁcates [14], but it also worth considering the
distribution of certiﬁcates among various authorities. An increasing
number of signing certiﬁcates may in fact be a healthy sign if it
indicates that authorities are using the new certiﬁcates in order to
reduce the impact of compromise.
As shown in Figure 2, we ﬁnd that more than 90% of browser-
trusted certiﬁcates are signed by the 10 largest commercial CAs,
are descendants of just 4 root certiﬁcates, and are directly signed
by 40 intermediate certiﬁcates. Several large companies have ac-
quired many of the smaller, previously independent commercial
CAs. Symantec owns Equifax, GeoTrust, TC TrustCenter, Thawte,
and VeriSign; GoDaddy owns Starﬁeld Technologies and ValiCert;
and Comodo owns AddTrust AB, eBiz Networks, Positive Software,
RegisterFly, Registry Pro, The Code Project, The USERTRUST
Network, WebSpace-Forum e.K., and Wotone Communications.
These consolidations ultimately allow three organizations (Syman-
tec, GoDaddy, and Comodo) to control 75% of the browser-trusted
certiﬁcates seen in our study. We list the top 10 parent organizations
in Table 4 and the top 10 commercial CAs in Table 5.
There is a long history of commercial CA compromise [8, 30, 32].
In each of these cases, web browsers and operating systems explic-
itly blacklisted the compromised signing certiﬁcate or misissued
certiﬁcates [8, 28]. However, if a compromised signing certiﬁcate
had signed for a substantial portion of the Internet, it would poten-
tially be infeasible to revoke it without causing signiﬁcant disruption
to the HTTPS ecosystem [23]. As such, we would hope that large
commercial authorities would distribute signing among a number
of intermediate certiﬁcates. However, as seen in Figure 2, the exact
opposite is true. More than 50% of all browser-trusted certiﬁcates
have been directly signed by 5 intermediate certiﬁcates and a single
