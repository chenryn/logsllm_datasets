## Failures in Understanding Risk
- **Fukushima Nuclear Disaster**
- **BP Oil Spill**

## The Other Side of the Coin
- **Takata Airbag Recall**
  - **Issue**: The airbag inflator may rupture and shoot shrapnel at passengers during deployment.
  - **Timeline**: Takata knew about the defects in 2004 and attempted to test bags off-hours to avoid disclosure.
  - **Regulatory Response**: The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) was criticized for their slow response to the problem.
  - **Scale**: 34 million cars were affected in North America, making it the largest single recall in automotive history.

### The Math Behind the Takata Recall
- **Number of Cars on U.S. Roads per Year**: 250,000,000
- **Number of Accidents in the U.S. per Year (2009)**: 5,500,000
- **Estimated Percentage of Accidents Involving Airbag Deployment**: 30% (assuming 70% of reported crashes are property damage only)
- **Assumption**: 100% of these involve a Takata airbag, and it deploys. In reality, 94% of affected cars have one Takata airbag, and 6% have two. Airbags deploy about 80% of the time in serious crashes.
- **Calculation**:
  - Number of Takata airbags deployed = (Number of affected cars / Total number of cars on the road) * Number of airbag deployments/year
  - ≈ 224,400 crashes/year where a Takata airbag deploys
- **Failure Rate**: Ballistic testing indicates failure rates up to 0.084%, with some samples at 0.04%.
- **Potential Injuries**: Approximately 188 people/year could be injured by Takata airbags.
- **Worst-Case Assumptions**: Adjusting for worst-case scenarios, we might be talking about 100 people/year.

### Financial Impact
- **Takata**: $500 million
- **Honda**: $340 million
- **Others**: Not yet reported
- **Total**: Easily over $1 billion

### Is Preventing 100 Injuries a Year Worth $1 Billion?
- **Comparison**:
  - ~500 people/year die from tuberculosis.
  - ~500 people/year die from accidental gunshot wounds.
  - 40,000 people/year die from suicide.
  - What would $1 billion do for these causes?

## What is Risk?
- **Definition**: A situation where something you value can be put in harm's way.
- **Examples**:
  - **Bank**: Situations that can lead to loss of funds or profit.
  - **Manufacturing Org**: Situations that lead to loss of intellectual property and pricing data.
  - **ISP**: Situations that can lead to service disruption or loss of customer data.

### Risk vs. Threat vs. Vulnerability
- **Risk Syntax**: Likelihood that Cause results in Impact.
- **Threat Syntax**: Actor does Action to Asset for Outcome because Motivation.
- **Vulnerability**: A weakness in a system that can be exploited.
- **Relationships**:
  - Risk is broader and more general than a threat. Multiple threats can contribute to a single risk.
  - Threats rely on vulnerabilities to be realized.

### Example
- **Risk**: It is highly likely that an attacker will gain access to our database server, leading to the loss of all personal information in the database and heavily damaging our brand.
  - **Likelihood**: Highly likely
  - **Cause**: An attacker will gain access to our database server
  - **Impact**: Loss of all personal information in the database and heavy damage to our brand

- **Threats**:
  - External attackers can execute SQL injection attacks against our web servers.
  - Insiders will inappropriately log in to the database server via shared credentials.
  - Nation-states will backdoor our database server hardware.

- **Vulnerabilities**:
  - Our website has SQL injection weaknesses.
  - We use shared credentials for database access.
  - We buy our servers from an Iranian on eBay.

## Measuring Risk
- **NIST 800-30 (2012 Publication)**:
  - **Likelihood Scale**:
    - Very High: Almost Certain
    - High: Highly Likely
    - Medium: Somewhat Likely
    - Low: Unlikely
    - Very Low: Highly Unlikely
  - **Impact Scale**:
    - Very High: Multiple Severe or Catastrophic
    - High: Severe or Catastrophic
    - Medium: Serious
    - Low: Limited
    - Very Low: Negligible

### Types of Risk
- **Technical Risk vs. Business Risk**:
  - **Technical Risk**: Impacts IT, engineering, development, or other technical operations.
  - **Business Risk**: Impacts business operations.
- **Inherent Risk vs. Residual Risk**:
  - **Inherent Risk**: Risk in the "as-is" system or system without compensating controls.
  - **Residual Risk**: Risk left over after implementing controls/remediation activities.

## Understanding Threats
- **Resource**: Google "Bruce Potter Derbycon Threat."

### Risk Frameworks
- **NIST 800-30r1**: Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments.
- **NIST Cyber Security Framework**: Common taxonomy of security controls and how to measure "as-is," "to-be," and maturity.
- **Cyber VAR**: Cyber Value at Risk.
- **HITRUST Risk Management Framework**: Healthcare-specific RMF.
- **Other Frameworks**: NIST 800-53, COBIT, ISO 27k, etc., can be turned into risk frameworks.

## Why is Risk Important to Hackers?
- **Credibility and Traction**: Incorrectly measuring risk can cause harm and waste time.
- **Example**:
  - A vulnerability that requires active man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attacks, MiTM each TCP connection, and non-trivial post-processing.
  - How would you rate this risk?

### PCI Compliance and Risk
- **Issues**:
  - Many requirements levied on individual web servers, particularly on cipher types and key sizes.
  - At the time of PCI standard creation, there was little evidence of weak crypto configurations being attacked.
  - Real issues are with backend systems and integrity of front-line systems like POS machines.
- **Breaches**:
  - Heartland, Target, Home Depot: All were PCI compliant at the time of breach.

### Operationalizing Risk
- **Framework Selection**: Pick a framework and run with it.
  - **NIST 800-30 and CSF**: 800-30 provides the process, CSF provides the structure.
- **Threat Modeling**:
  - MS-Style
  - Custom
  - Others
- **Assessment Methods**:
  - Architectural assessment
  - Code review
  - Penetration testing/VA
  - Using common sense

### Conclusion
- **Core Concept**: Risk management is fundamental in banking and cybersecurity.
- **Application**: Apply risk concepts for vulnerability release and analysis, new defenses, attack methods, threat actors, and campaigns.
