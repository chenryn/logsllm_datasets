User: How to create a virtual private cloud (VPC) on AWS?
Assistant: The following are the steps to create a virtual private cloud on AWS: 1. Log in to the AWS console, select "Service" -> "VPC" -> "Start VPC creation". 2. In the "Create VPC Wizard", select "Standard VPC", and fill in the VPC name and CIDR block. A CIDR block defines all IP address ranges that exist in a VPC. Make sure the CIDR block is not duplicated with other existing VPCs or subnets. 3. Split the VPC into multiple subnets to better manage network traffic. Select Add Subnet, select the availability zone to which the subnet belongs, and the CIDR block of the subnet. Make sure the subnet CIDR block is a subset of the VPC CIDR block. 4. Create an Internet Gateway (IGW) and attach it to the VPC. IGW is a virtual router that allows VPCs to communicate with the Internet. Select "Internet Gateway" -> "Create Internet Gateway" and attach it to the VPC. 5. Configure the routing table for the VPC. Routing tables define how network traffic should be transmitted. Select "Routing Table" -> "Create Routing Table" and associate it with the VPC. Configure routing tables for each subnet to ensure traffic is routed correctly. 6. Create security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic to EC2 instances in the VPC. Select "Security Group" -> "Create Security Group" and define the name and description of the security group. Add inbound and outbound rules to security groups to control traffic. 7. Create EC2 instances or other services/resources in the VPC. Select "Instance" -> "Launch Instance" in the console and follow the instructions in the instance launch wizard. 8. Verify that the VPC is working properly. You can verify whether the VPC connection is normal through a ping test or other network tools. If something goes wrong, you can go back to the previous steps to troubleshoot. These steps cover the basic process of creating a virtual private network on AWS. In the actual operation process, there may be other additional steps or details, depending on the specific situation.
