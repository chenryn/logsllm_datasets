assuming all antennas are co-located. A more detailed model that accounts
for the fact that the antennas are not completely co-located shows that for
a trajectory to be invisible (i.e., coincide with the DC line) two conditions
have to hold: (1) the person moves on an ellipse whose foci are the ﬁrst
transmit antenna and the receive antenna, (2) she moves on an ellipse whose
foci are the second transmit antenna and the receive antenna. However, the
locus of such motion is discontinuous.
Figure 4—Wi-Vi tracks the motion of two humans. The ﬁgure shows how
the presence of two humans translates into two curved lines whose angles
vary in time, and one straight line which corresponds to the DC.
MUSIC computes the power density along each angles θ as:
A![θ, n] =
k=1 ||&w
&K
1
i=1 e−j 2π
λ i∆ sin θUN[n](i, k)||2
.
(6)
where K is the total number of noise eigenvectors.
In comparison to the conventional MUSIC algorithm described
above, smoothed MUSIC performs an additional step before it com-
putes the correlation matrix. It partitions each array h of size w into
overlapping sub-arrays of size w! < w. It then computes the cor-
relation matrices for each of these sub-arrays. Finally, it combines
the different correlation matrices by summing them up before per-
forming the eigen decomposition. The additional step performed by
smoothed MUSIC is intended to de-correlate signals arriving from
spatially different entities. Speciﬁcally, by taking different shifts for
the same antenna array, reﬂections from different bodies get shifted
by different amounts depending on the distance and orientation of
the reﬂector, which helps de-correlating them [31].
Fig. 4 shows the result of applying smoothed MUSIC on the sig-
nal captured from two moving humans. Similar to Fig. 3(b), the
y-axis corresponds to the angle, and the x-axis corresponds to time.
As before, the zero line corresponds to DC. At any point in time, we
see signiﬁcant energy at two angles (besides the DC). For example,
at time n = 0.5s, both humans have negative angles and, hence,
are moving away from Wi-Vi. Between n = 1s and n = 2s, only
one angle is present. This may be because the other human is not
moving or he/she is too far inside the room. Again, from n = 2s to
n = 3s, we see both humans, one moving towards the device and
the other moving away (since one has a positive angle while the
other has a negative angle).
One point is worth emphasizing: the smoothed MUSIC algorithm
is conceptually similar to the standard antenna array beamforming
discussed in §5.1; both approaches aim at identifying the spatial
angle of the signal. However, by projecting on the null space and
taking the inverse norm (as described in Eq. 6), MUSIC achieves
sharper peaks, and hence is often termed a super-resolution tech-
nique [34]. Because smoothed MUSIC is similar to antenna array
beamforming, it can be used even to detect a single moving object,
i.e., the presence of a single person. In fact, Fig. 3(b) was generated
by the smoothed MUSIC algorithm.11
Finally, to enable Wi-Vi to automatically detect the number of
humans in a closed room, one option is to train a machine learning
classiﬁer using images like those in Fig. 3(b) and Fig. 4. We dis-
covered, however, that a simple heuristic based on spatial variance
11Plotting the magnitude of A[θ, n] as opposed to A![θ, n] gives the same
ﬁgure but with more noise. This is because, unlike standard beamforming,
the MUSIC algorithm does not incur signiﬁcant side lobes which would
otherwise mask part of signal reﬂected from different objects.
80works well in practice. As explained earlier, moving humans appear
as curved lines in the 2-D function A![θ, n]. Any human can be only
at one location at any point in time. Thus, at any point in time, the
larger the number of humans, the higher the spatial variance. The
spatial variance is computed as follows. First, Wi-Vi computes the
spatial centroid as a function of time:
C[n] =
90%θ=−90
θ · 20 log10 A![θ, n],
(7)
where A![θ, n] is given by Eq. 6. It then computes the spatial vari-
ance as:
VAR[n] =
90%θ=−90
θ2 · 20 log10 A![θ, n] − C[n]2
(8)
This variance is then averaged over the duration of the experiment
to return one number that describes the spatial variance in the room
for the duration of the measurement. Wi-Vi uses a training set and a
testing set to learn the thresholds that separate the spatial variances
corresponding to 0, 1, 2, or 3 humans. The testing and training
experiments are conducted in different rooms. In §7.4, we evalu-
ate this scheme and measure its ability at automatically capture the
number of moving humans.
6. THROUGH-WALL GESTURE-BASED COMMU-
NICATION
For a human to transmit a message to a computer wirelessly, she
typically has to carry a wireless device. In contrast, Wi-Vi can en-
able a human who does not carry any wireless device to commu-
nicate commands or short messages to a receiver using simple ges-
tures. Wi-Vi designates a pair of gestures as a ‘0’ bit and a ‘1’ bit. A
human can compose these gestures to create messages that have dif-
ferent interpretations. Additionally, Wi-Vi can evolve by borrowing
other existing principles and practices from today’s communication
systems, such as adding a simple code to ensure reliability, or re-
serving a certain pattern of ‘0’s and ‘1’s for packet preambles. At
this stage, Wi-Vi’s interface is still very basic, yet we believe that
future advances in through-wall technology can render this inter-
face more expressive.
Below, we describe the gesture-based communication channel
that we implemented with Wi-Vi.
6.1 Gesture Encoding
At the transmitter side, the ‘0’ and ‘1’ bits must be encoded using
some modulation scheme. Wi-Vi implements this encoding using
gestures. One can envision a wide variety of gestures to represent
these bits. However, in choosing our encoding we have imposed
three conditions: 1) the gestures must be composable – i.e. at the
end of each bit, whether ‘0’ or ‘1’, the human should be back in
the same initial state as the start of the gesture. This enables the
person to compose multiple such gestures to send a longer message.
2) The gestures must be simple so that a human ﬁnds it easy to
perform them and compose them. 3) The gestures should be easy
to detect and decode without requiring sophisticated decoders, such
as machine learning classiﬁers.
Given the above constraints, we have selected the following ges-
tures to modulate the bits: a ‘0’ bit is a step forward followed by a
step backward; a ‘1’ bit is a step backward followed by a step for-
ward. This modulation is similar to Manchester encoding, where
a ‘0’ bit is represented by a falling edge of the clock, (i.e., an in-
crease in the signal value followed by a decrease,) and a ‘1’ bit is
represented by a rising edge of the clock, (i.e., a reduction in sig-
Figure 5—Gestures as detected by Wi-Vi. The ﬁgure shows a sequence
of four steps: step forward, step backward, step backward, step forward.
Forward steps appear as triangles above the zero line; backward steps appear
as inverted triangles below the zero line. Each pair of steps represents a
gesture/bit: the ﬁrst two represent bit ‘0’, the second two represent bit ‘1’.

Figure 6—Gestures as Angles. Recall θ’s magnitude and sign as deﬁned
in §5.1. In (a), the subject takes one step forward; the emulated antenna
array’s normal forms an angle of 90◦ with the line from the human to Wi-
Vi. Because the vector of the motion and the vector from the human to Wi-Vi
are in same direction, θ is positive; hence, it is +90◦. In (b), the subject takes
a step backward, and θ = −90 degrees. In (c), the subject does not exactly
know where the Wi-Vi device is, so he performs the steps towards the wall,
without orienting himself directly toward Wi-Vi. Note that the vector of
motion and the vector from the human to Wi-Vi are in the same direction;
hence, θ is positive. However, due to the slanted orientation, it is now +60◦
(rather than +90◦).
nal value followed by an increase) [2]. These gestures are simple,
composable and easy to decode as we show in §6.2.
Fig. 5 shows the signal captured by Wi-Vi, at the output of the
smoothed MUSIC algorithm for each of these two gestures. Taking
a step forward towards the Wi-Vi device produces a positive angle,
whereas taking a step backward produces a negative angle. The ex-
act values of the produced angles depend on whether the human
is exactly oriented towards the device. Recall that the angle is be-
tween the vector orthogonal to the motion and the line connecting
the human to the Wi-Vi device, and its sign is positive when the hu-
man is moving toward Wi-Vi and negative when the human moves
away from Wi-Vi. As shown in Fig. 6, if the human is directly ori-
ented towards the device, the two angles are +90◦ and -90◦. If the
human does not know the exact location of the Wi-Vi device and
simply steps in its general direction, the absolute value of the angle
is smaller, but the shape of the bit is maintained.
6.2 Gesture Decoding
Decoding the above gestures is fairly simple and follows stan-
dard communication techniques. Speciﬁcally, Wi-Vi’s decoder
takes as input A![θ, n]. Similar to a standard decoder [16], Wi-Vi
applies a matched ﬁlter on this signal. However, since each bit is
a combination of two steps, forward and backward, Wi-Vi applies
two matched ﬁlters: one for the step forward and one for the step

backward. Because of the structure of the signal shown in Fig. 5,
the two matched ﬁlters are simply a triangle above the zero line,
and an inverted triangle below the zero line. Wi-Vi applies these
ﬁlters separately on the received signal, then adds up their output.
Fig. 7 shows the results of applying the matched ﬁlters on the
received signal in Fig. 5. Note that the signal after applying the
matched ﬁlters looks fairly similar to a BPSK signal, where a peak
above the zero line represents a ‘1’ bit and a trough below the zero
line represents a ‘0’ bit. (Though, in Wi-Vi, our encoding is such
that a peak or a trough alone only represents half a bit.) Next, Wi-
Vi uses a standard peak detector to detect the peaks/troughs and
match them to the corresponding bits. Fig. 7 shows the identiﬁed
peaks and the detected bits for the two-bit message in Fig. 5.

IMPLEMENTATION AND EVALUATION
In this section, we describe our implementation and the results
of our experimental evaluation.
7.1
Implementation
We built Wi-Vi using USRP N210 software radios [8] with SBX
daughter boards. The system uses LP0965 directional antennas [3],
which provide a gain of 6 dBi. The system consists of three US-
RPs connected to an external clock so that they act as one MIMO
system. Two of the USRPs are used for transmitting, and one for
receiving. MIMO nulling is implemented directly into the UHD
driver, so that it is performed in real-time. Post-processing using
the smoothed MUSIC algorithm is performed on the obtained traces
ofﬂine in Matlab R2012a under Ubuntu 11.10 on a 64-bit machine
with Intel i7 processor. Matlab already has a built-in and highly
optimized smoothed MUSIC implementation. Processing traces of
25-second length took on average 1.0564s per trace, with a standard
deviation of 0.2561s.
We implement standard Wi-Fi OFDM modulation in the UHD
code; each OFDM symbol consists of 64 subcarriers including the
DC. The nulling procedure in §4 is performed on a subcarrier basis.
The channel measurements across the different subcarriers are com-
bined to improve the SNR. Since USRPs cannot process signals in
real-time at 20 MHz, we reduced the transmitted signal bandwidth
to 5 MHz so that our nulling can still run in real time.
Finally, the emulated antenna array was taken over 0.32 seconds.
The collected samples during this duration were averaged into an
antenna array of size w = 100, which was provided as an input to
the smoothed MUSIC algorithm.
7.2 Experimental Setup
Most of our experiments were run in one ofﬁce building using
two different conference rooms. The rooms have standard furniture:
tables, chairs, boards, etc. The interior walls of the building are
6-inch hollow walls supported by steel frames with sheet rock on
top. The ﬁrst conference room is 7 × 4 meters; the second is 11 ×
7 meters. We also conducted some experiments in a second building
on our campus which has 8-inch concrete walls.
The experiments were conducted with eight human subjects,
three women and ﬁve men, of different heights and builds. For the
tracking experiments, we asked the subjects to enter a room, close
the door, and move at will. The through-wall gesture experiments
were performed with four subjects (one woman and three men).
The persons were shown the gestures in advance and tried them
a few times. Then, each of them entered the room separately and
performed the gestures. The experiments are repeated in different
locations in different rooms, and in different locations in each room.
7.3 Micro Benchmarks
First, we would like to get a better understanding of the informa-
tion captured by Wi-Vi, and how it relates to the moving objects.
We run experiments in two conference rooms in our building. Both
conference rooms have 6!! hollow walls supported by steel frames
with sheet rock on top. In all of these experiments, we position Wi-
Vi one meter away from a wall that has neither a door nor a window.
For each of our experiments, we ask a number of humans between
1 and 3 to enter the room, close the door, and move at will. Wi-Vi
performs nulling in real time and collects a trace of the signals. We
perform each experiment with a different subset of our subjects. We
process the collected traces using the smoothed MUSIC algorithm
as described in §5.2.
Fig. 8 shows the output of Wi-Vi in the presence of one, two, or
three humans moving in a closed room. Consider the plots with one
human in Figs. 8(a). Besides the DC, the graphs show one fuzzy
curved line. The line tracks the spatial angle of the moving human.
Compare these ﬁgures with the set of ﬁgures in 8(b), which capture
two moving humans. In 8(b), we can discern two curved lines that
track the angular motion of these humans with respect to Wi-Vi. If
we take a vertical line at any time, in any of the two-human ﬁgures,
we see at most two bright lines, besides the DC. This is because,
in these ﬁgures, at any point in time, there are at most two moving
bodies in the room. Let us zoom in on the interval [1s, 2s] in 8(b1).
During this interval, we see only one curved line. This has two pos-
sible interpretations: either one of the two people stopped moving
or he/she was too deep inside the room that we could not capture
his/her signal. As we move to 8(c), the ﬁgures get fuzzier since
we have more people moving in the same area. However the gen-
eral observations carry to these ﬁgures. Speciﬁcally, we can identify
the presence of three humans from observing multiple intervals in
which we can discern three curved lines. For example, consider the
interval [1.8s, 2.5s] in 8(c1); it shows two lines with positive angles
and one with a negative angle. These lines indicate that two people
are moving towards Wi-Vi, while one person is moving away.
