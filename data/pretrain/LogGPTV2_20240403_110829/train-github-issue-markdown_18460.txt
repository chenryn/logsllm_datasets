# Summary of the new feature
I would like to customize PowerToys Run's shell (used for launching commands
starting with `> `).
For example I would like to use Power Shell Core instead of cmd. Here's many
more options might be available.
  * cmd
  * PowerShell
  * PowerShell Core
  * WSL
  * Custom shell (eg.: git, zsh, ...)
    C:\Program Files(x86)\Myshell\customshell.exe --interactive --command "{0}"
> `{0}` might be used for shell command.
