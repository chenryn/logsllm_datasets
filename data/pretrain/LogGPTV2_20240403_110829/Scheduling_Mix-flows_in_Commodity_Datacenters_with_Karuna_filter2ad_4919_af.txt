### Type 1 Flows
This formulation is more appropriate when deadlines represent the worst-case requirements (e.g., Service Level Agreements) rather than the expected performance, as assumed in this paper. For the current formulation, we plan to enhance the queue length estimation by using models with fewer assumptions (e.g., M/G/1). Additionally, we intend to verify the safety of the relaxations and approximations through perturbation analysis.

### Appendix A: Optimal Thresholds
We describe our formulation to derive optimal thresholds for the splitter and sieve to minimize the average Flow Completion Time (FCT) for type 2 and 3 flows.

#### Problem Formulation
We take the cumulative density functions (CDFs) of the flow sizes for different types as given. Denote \( F_1(\cdot) \), \( F_2(\cdot) \), and \( F_3(\cdot) \) as the respective traffic distributions of the three types, and \( F(\cdot) \) as the overall distribution. Thus, \( F(\cdot) = \sum_{i=1}^3 F_i(\cdot) \).

As in ยง5, type 2 flows are split into different priorities based on their sizes with splitting thresholds \(\{\beta\}\), and type 3 flows are sieved in a multi-level feedback queue with sieving thresholds \(\{\alpha\}\). We assume that flow arrivals follow a Poisson process, and denote the network load as \(\rho\), where \(0 \leq \rho \leq 1\).

For a type 2 flow with priority \(j\), the expected FCT is upper-bounded by [28]:
\[ T^{(2)}_j = \frac{\rho (F_2(\beta_j) - F_2(\beta_{j-1}))}{1 - \rho (F_1(\alpha_K) + F_2(\beta_{j-1}) + F_3(\alpha_{j-1}))} \]

For a type 3 flow with size in \([\alpha_{j-1}, \alpha_j)\), it experiences delays in different priorities up to the \(j\)-th priority. The average time a type 3 flow spends in the \(j\)-th queue is:
\[ T^{(3)}_j = \frac{\rho (F_3(\alpha_j) - F_3(\alpha_{j-1}))}{1 - \rho (F_1(\alpha_K) + F_2(\beta_{j-1}) + F_3(\alpha_{j-1}))} \]

The problem is to choose an optimal set of thresholds \(\{\alpha, \beta\}\) to minimize the objective: the average FCT of type 2 and 3 flows in the network:
\[ \min_{\{\alpha\}, \{\beta\}} \sum_{l=1}^K \left( (F_2(\beta_l) - F_2(\beta_{l-1})) T^{(2)}_l + (F_3(\alpha_l) - F_3(\alpha_{l-1})) \sum_{m=1}^l T^{(3)}_m \right) \]
subject to:
\[ \alpha_0 = 0, \quad \alpha_K = \infty, \quad \alpha_{j-1} < \alpha_j, \quad j = 1, \ldots, K \]
\[ \beta_0 = 0, \quad \beta_K = \infty, \quad \beta_{j-1} < \beta_j, \quad j = 1, \ldots, K \]

To simplify the notation, we define:
\[ \phi_j = F_2(\beta_j) - F_2(\beta_{j-1}) \]
\[ \theta_j = F_3(\alpha_j) - F_3(\alpha_{j-1}) \]

Thus, \(\phi_j\) denotes the percentage of type 2 flows with sizes in \([\beta_{j-1}, \beta_j)\), and \(\theta_j\) denotes the percentage of type 3 flows with sizes in \([\alpha_{j-1}, \alpha_j)\). The objective can be transformed equivalently to:
\[ \min_{\{\theta\}, \{\phi\}} \sum_{l=1}^K \left( \phi_l T^{(2)}_l + \theta_l \sum_{m=1}^l T^{(3)}_m \right) \]
where \(\hat{F}_1 = F_1(\infty)\), the fraction of type 1 flows.

#### Solution Method
We identify this as a quadratic sum-of-ratios problem due to the term \(\frac{\theta_l}{\sum_{i=1}^{l-1} \theta_i}\), which has been thoroughly investigated by the applied mathematical modeling and optimization communities [23, 25, 36]. We use relaxation techniques and solve for the lower bound of the objective. Notice that:
\[ 1 - \hat{F}_1 - \rho \sum_{i=1}^{l-1} (\theta_i + \phi_i) \]
is strictly smaller than 1, thus:
\[ \rho \sum_{l=1}^K \frac{\phi_l + \theta_l}{1 - \hat{F}_1 - \rho \sum_{i=1}^{l-1} (\theta_i + \phi_i)} \]
must be the lower bound of the objective for all possible choices of the thresholds. Therefore, we look for a set of percentages \(\{\phi\}\) and \(\{\theta\}\) that minimize the lower bound. The problem then becomes:
\[ \min_{\{\theta\}, \{\phi\}} \sum_{l=1}^K \left( \phi_l + \theta_l \right) \]
subject to:
\[ \sum_{i=1}^K \phi_i = F_2(\infty) \]
\[ \sum_{i=1}^K \theta_i = F_3(\infty) \]

Now the problem is relaxed into a quadratic programming problem with linear constraints, which can be solved using semidefinite programming packages available in many solvers. We use the CVX toolbox [19] for MATLAB to solve the above problem. Since the complexity of the problem is related to the number of queues in the switches, the scale of the network is irrelevant, and we can solve it in under 10 seconds on a testbed machine.
