Challenge http://freecodecamp.com/challenges/waypoint-target-a-specific-child-
of-an-element-using-jquery has an issue. Please describe how to reproduce it,
and include links to screenshots if possible.
I'm hitting the 'run code' button and it does nothing. I've tried refreshing
the page and same response. I can't progress past this challenge because of
this.If in fact I have a syntax error, there needs to be some pop up telling
me so, otherwise I have no idea.
