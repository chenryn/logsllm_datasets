Question: "After a CrashOnAuditFail event, an administrator claims that the system's security posture is not compromised since the event simply indicates a routine system reboot. Which of the following is the best counterargument to this claim?"
 "A": "The event may indicate that the system's audit log was full, preventing further recording of auditable activities, which is a security concern."
 "B": "Such an event is routine and does not reflect on the system's security, as all systems must reboot periodically for updates."
 "C": "The event is an indication of a potential hardware malfunction, which should be the focus rather than security implications."
 "D": "This event must be ignored as it is a false positive, often triggered by benign activities and poses no real threat."
Answer: A
