As you can see the CI was passing correctly before.
https://github.com/UltiRequiem/eloquent-javascript/commits/main
But since UltiRequiem/eloquent-javascript@`a5f766e`
While creating code coverage I'm getting this errors:
    deno test --coverage=./cov
> This step works as expected
    deno coverage --unstable --lcov ./cov > cov.lcov
    ============================================================
    Deno has panicked. This is a bug in Deno. Please report this
    at https://github.com/denoland/deno/issues/new.
    If you can reliably reproduce this panic, include the
    reproduction steps and re-run with the RUST_BACKTRACE=1 env
    var set and include the backtrace in your report.

    note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace
But as far I can see on UltiRequiem/eloquent-javascript@`a5f766e` there isn't
any invalid unicode?
