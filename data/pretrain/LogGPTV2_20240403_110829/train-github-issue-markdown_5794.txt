Prior to the recent changes, the Continuous Integration (CI) was functioning correctly. You can review the commit history [here](https://github.com/UltiRequiem/eloquent-javascript/commits/main).

However, since the commit `a5f766e` in the repository [UltiRequiem/eloquent-javascript](https://github.com/UltiRequiem/eloquent-javascript), I have encountered the following errors while generating code coverage reports:

1. **Command:**
   ```sh
   deno test --coverage=./cov
   ```
   - **Result:** This step completes successfully.

2. **Command:**
   ```sh
   deno coverage --unstable --lcov ./cov > cov.lcov
   ```
   - **Result:**
     ```
     ============================================================
     Deno has panicked. This is a bug in Deno. Please report this
     at https://github.com/denoland/deno/issues/new.
     If you can reliably reproduce this panic, include the
     reproduction steps and re-run with the RUST_BACKTRACE=1 env
     var set and include the backtrace in your report.
     Platform: linux x86_64
     Version: 1.21.0
     Args: ["deno", "coverage", "--unstable", "--lcov", "./cov"]
     thread 'main' panicked at 'called `Result::unwrap()` on an `Err` value: BadJson(Error("invalid unicode code point", line: 1, column: 2043))', cli/tools/coverage/mod.rs:175:57
     note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace
     ```

Upon reviewing the changes in commit `a5f766e`, I do not see any invalid Unicode characters that could be causing this issue. You can view the detailed CI run [here](https://github.com/UltiRequiem/eloquent-javascript/runs/6168539434?check_suite_focus=true).
