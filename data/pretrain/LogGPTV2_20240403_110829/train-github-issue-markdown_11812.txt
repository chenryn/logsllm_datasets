### Example
Set up a brand new FastAPI venv:
    virtualenv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install fastapi[all] pytest
Copy/paste example from the testing docs at
https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/testing/:
    from fastapi import FastAPI
    from fastapi.testclient import TestClient
    app = FastAPI()
    @app.get("/")
    async def read_main():
        return {"msg": "Hello World"}
    client = TestClient(app)
    def test_read_main():
        response = client.get("/")
        assert response.status_code == 200
        assert response.json() == {"msg": "Hello World"}
Observe that the tests take 30s to run. If you add another .get call, they
take 60s.
### Description
On Mac with new install of FastAPI, every call to `TestClient.get()` takes
exactly 30s to complete. The response is correct.
### Environment
