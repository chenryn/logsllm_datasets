**Table 2: Google Play App Vulnerability Based on Category**

- **Vulnerability Rate**: 75.7% of apps from Baidu, Gfan, Mumayi, Appchina, and Xiaomi are vulnerable.
- **Leading Cause**: Insecure broadcast channels (unprotected receiver or broadcast without target package).
- **Google Play Apps**: 24.8% are problematic, primarily due to the lack of User-ID checks.
- **Geographic Discrepancy**: Chinese apps are free from service confusion issues, as they typically use a single service. Only a small set of Google Play apps have IPC problems.
- **Push-Messaging Services**: Over 50% are vulnerable, with most service SDKs in China having security weaknesses.

**Consequences of Vulnerabilities**

- **Sensitive Data Categories**: 50-70% of business, shopping, medical, health, finance, communication, and social apps are vulnerable.
- **Primary Causes**: Missing User-ID checks (55-85%) and PendingIntent exposure (10-18%), which allows malicious apps to inject content and intercept private messages.
- **Service Confusion**: 5-18% of medical and shopping apps are vulnerable to message injection from impersonated messaging services.

**Impact and Trend**

- **Popular Apps**: Over 23% of popular apps (each with more than 1 million downloads) are vulnerable, including high-profile apps like Facebook and Skype.
- **Service Confusion**: This problem is more common in extremely popular (over 100 million downloads) or rarely used (below 100 installs) apps.
- **PendingIntent Disclosure**: More prevalent in popular apps, often due to the use of vulnerable GCM templates.

**Related Work**

- **Security Analysis of Push-Messaging Services**: Limited research until recently, focusing on GCM, ADM, UrbanAirship, and Chinese Push Cloud. Our study is broader, analyzing 30 cloud-messaging services and 35,173 apps.
- **Android ICC Security**: Extensive studies on Intent-based attacks and other ICC vulnerabilities. Our work specifically examines push-messaging services and proposes novel sample code-guided analysis techniques.
- **Static Analysis on Android**: Various tools for detecting vulnerabilities, privacy leaks, and malware. Our unique design, particularly the anchor-based, layered security analysis, is more efficient for push-messaging integrations.
