As stated in #677 currently you have to wrap a v-for with an if to catch if an
array is empty. I'd love a tag like `v-empty` to do that. It would work like
`v-else` and you put it right after a `v-for` (maybe also `v-else` could also
be reused for that?).  
The `v-empty` block triggeres if the `v-for` list is empty. Just like the
equivalent django template tag:
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/ref/templates/builtins/#for-empty
Example:
      {{ index }} {{ item.message }}
