User: How do I get the MAC address of a remote host on my LAN?  I'm using Python and Linux.
Assistant: Many years ago, I was tasked with gathering various machine info from all machines on a corporate campus.  One desired piece of info was the MAC address, which is difficult to get on a network that spanned multiple subnets.  At the time, I used the Windows built-in "nbtstat" command.
Today there is a Unix utility called "nbtscan" that provides similar info.  If you do not wish to use an external tool, maybe there are NetBIOS libraries for python that could be used to gather the info for you?
