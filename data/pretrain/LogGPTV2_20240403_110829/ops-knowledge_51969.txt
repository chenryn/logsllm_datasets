User: What aspects need attention when using Kubernetes for container orchestration?
Assistant: 1. High availability: In order to ensure continuous service of load, each component of Kubernetes service must be configured in high availability mode to prevent single point of failure. 2. Security: To ensure the security of Kubernetes and its cluster components, it is necessary to configure corresponding security measures such as access control and key management. 3. Resource management: Resource management is required to ensure that each container in the Kubernetes cluster can work smoothly, and at the same time, it is necessary to pay attention to the reasonable allocation of resources to avoid waste. 4. Image management: It is necessary to manage container images, including image version control, security, and the construction of private image libraries. 5. Network management: It is necessary to correctly configure the network settings of the container, including network drivers, network topology, network plug-ins, etc. 6. Monitoring and logging: It is necessary to configure monitoring and logging tools for the Kubernetes cluster in order to detect potential problems in time and deal with them in a timely manner. 7. Community maintenance: Since Kubernetes is an open source project, it is necessary to keep up with the latest developments in community maintenance and find solutions to problems.
