Hello,

I would like to propose the addition of a "regex literal" type. This would allow us to ensure that a string matches a specific pattern at the time of assignment.

With the recent introduction of literal string types, I have found it very convenient to type my variables, especially for React props (e.g., `size: "small" | "big"`). Extending this concept, it would be useful to be able to type a variable with a regular expression pattern.

For example:
```typescript
var myString: /\d{3}.*\d{2}/;
myString = "555hhhhh44"; // correct
myString = "55dsds5dss4"; // error
```

In React, this feature could be particularly valuable for defining props that need to match specific formats, such as phone numbers, email addresses, and dates.

Best regards,  
Xavier
