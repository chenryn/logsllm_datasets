Hello,  
I would suggest to add a "regex literal" type to make ensuring that a string
data matches a pattern at assigment.
As the literal string feature has been added in the latest release, i found
very convenient to type my variables with, e.g. for typing my react props
(size : "small"| "big" )... On the same idea, it could be convenient to be
able to type a variable with a pattern.
Example :
        var myString : /\d{3}.*\d{2}/;
        myString="555hhhhh44" ; //correct
        myString="55dsds5dss4"; //error
In react it could be vey useful for defining a react prop like phone numbers,
emails, dates, ...
regards
