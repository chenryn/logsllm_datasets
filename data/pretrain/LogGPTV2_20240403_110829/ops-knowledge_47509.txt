User: I previously used to copy Python/Perl scripts to access from my bash script. Duplication is not a good idea I know! Is there a way to call them from bin or libs folder that we have set up? 
For instance :

My python script resides in /home/ThinkCode/libs/python/script.py
My bash script resides in /home/ThinkCode/NewProcess/ProjectA/run.sh
Now I want to use/call script.py from run.sh

Thank you!
Assistant: Just do python /path/to/my/python/script.py.
