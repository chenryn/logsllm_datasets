I am currently working on a project that involves using APScheduler to periodically upload a data file via `pexpect.run('scp ...')`. The `scp` command works seamlessly from the command line without password authentication, as the necessary keys have already been shared. However, when I run the same command in a Python script on a BeagleBone Black (initiated remotely using `pexpect`), the `scp` operation fails. This is because BlackBear (which replaces OpenSSH on the BeagleBone Black) does not load the private key correctly.

When I attempt to specify the private key with the `-i ~/.ssh/id_rsa` option, I encounter an error from `/usr/bin/dbclient`: "Exited: String too long." This issue appears to be a bug within `dbclient`, which is part of the BlackBear package.

Additionally, when I try to convert my private key using the `dropbearconvert` command:
```bash
dropbearconvert openssh dropbear id_rsa id_rsa.db
```
I receive the following error: "Error: Ciphers other than DES-EDE3-CBC not supported."

I attempted to install OpenSSH, but this was unsuccessful due to a conflict with BlackBear. Before I consider switching to Ubuntu, I would like to explore any potential solutions or workarounds for this issue. I have invested a significant amount of effort into customizing Angstrom, so changing the operating system at this point would be quite challenging.

As a temporary workaround, I have managed to schedule the pulling of files from the server using APScheduler and `pexpect.run` along with `scp`. While this solution is less than ideal, as I prefer to have the always-running processes on the BeagleBones rather than the server, it will suffice until I can allocate enough time to switch to Ubuntu.

If anyone has suggestions on how to get BlackBear working properly, I would greatly appreciate your input.

Thank you,
