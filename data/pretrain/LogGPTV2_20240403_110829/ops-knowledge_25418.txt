User: I am working on having APScheduler upload a data file periodically using pexepect.run('scp ...'). The scp command works fine from the command line without password authentication (keys have been shared). However, when running in a python script on Beaglebone Black (started from a remote machine using pexpect), scp fails because blackbear (which replaces openssh on the BBB) doesn't load the private key properly. When I add -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa, then I get an error from /usr/bin/dbclient: Exited: String too long; dbclient is part of blackbear and this appears to be bug. When trying to convert my private key using >dropbearconvert openssh dropbear id_rsa id_rsa.db, I get the error: Error: Ciphers other than DES-EDE3-CBC not supported. I tried to install openssh, but this didn't work due to a conflict with blackbear. Just before I give up on Angstrom and go to Ubuntu, are there any suggestions.? I have already added a lot to Angstrom so changing operating systems at this time is painful. Thanks. Bit_Pusher
Assistant: As a temporary workaround, I found I could schedule pulling from the server using APScheduler and pexpect.run along with scp. This is less than ideal, as I prefer to have the always running processes on the beaglebones, rather than the server, but it will suffice until I can schedule enough time to switch to Ubuntu. Still, if anyone has suggestions on how to get blackbear working, I would much like to hear them. Bit_Pusher
