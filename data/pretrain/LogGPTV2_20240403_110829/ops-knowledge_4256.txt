User:  How to Modify Linux Kernel Parameters During System Tuning?
Assistant: To modify the Linux kernel parameters, you can follow the steps below: 1. View the current kernel parameters Use the command `sysctl -a` to view all the kernel parameters of the current system. 2. To modify the kernel parameters, you can edit the `/etc/sysctl.conf` file, add or modify the parameters that need to be modified, and save it. You can also use the command `sysctl` to dynamically modify kernel parameters. For example, adding the following line to the `/etc/sysctl.conf` file can limit the use of system resources: ``` fs.file-max = 65535 ``` 3. To make the modification take effect use the command `sysctl -p` to Make changes in `/etc/sysctl.conf` take effect. 4. Restart the system Some kernel parameters can only take effect when the system starts, so after modifying these parameters, you need to restart the system to make them take effect. It should be noted that you need to be cautious when modifying kernel parameters. Improper modification may lead to system instability or serious problems. It is recommended to back up relevant configuration files before making modifications.
