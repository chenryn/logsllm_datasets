When I am writing a declaration file, I found it really frustrating repeating
the inherited method that returns the instance itself for a correct return
type.
E.g. for animation library GSAP, many classes are inherited from class
`Animation`, I have to repeat almost every method to update return type
`Animation` to the current class.
    class Animation {
        chain(): Animation;
    }
    class TweenLite extends Animation {
        ownProperty: any;
        chain(): TweenLite;
    }
It would be great if we may use some type like `self` to make this easier,
like this:
    class Animation {
        chain(): self;
    }
    class TweenLite extends Animation {
        ownProperty: any;
    }
