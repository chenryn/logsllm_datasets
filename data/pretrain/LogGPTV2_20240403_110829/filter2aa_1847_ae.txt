### Chapter 2: DNS Service

If you are using Mac OS X Server as your DHCP server, follow these steps to configure it:

1. In **Server Settings**, click the **Network** tab, then select **DHCP/NetBoot** and choose **Configure DHCP/NetBoot**.
2. On the **Subnet** tab, select the subnet on the built-in Ethernet port and click **Edit**.
3. In the **General** tab, enter the following information:
   - **Start IP Address:** 10.0.1.3
   - **End IP Address:** 10.0.1.254
   - **Subnet Mask:** 255.255.255.0
   - **Router:** 10.0.1.1
4. Click the **DNS** tab and enter the following information:
   - **Default Domain:** example.com
   - **DNS Servers:** 10.0.1.2
5. Click the **Save** button and log out of **Server Settings**.

**Note:** Client computers may not immediately update with the new IP configuration information. This depends on when their DHCP leases expire. Restarting the client computers may be necessary for the changes to take effect.

#### Check Your Configuration

To verify that the configuration was successful, open **Terminal** (located in **/Applications/Utilities**) and enter the following commands, substituting the local domain name as appropriate:

```sh
dig server.example.com
dig -x 10.0.1.2
```

**Note:** If this generic configuration example does not meet your needs, Apple recommends consulting a professional or seeking additional documentation before attempting to configure DNS on your own.

### Using DNS with Dynamically Assigned IP Addresses

**Dynamic DNS (DDNS)** is a mechanism that allows you to modify the IP address/domain name list without requiring the name server to reload the edited list. This means you can update the name server remotely and easily modify DNS data.

You can use DDNS with DHCP service. DHCP assigns each client computer a dynamic IP address when the computer starts up. Since a DHCP server may assign IP addresses randomly, it can be useful to assign meaningful DNS names to these addresses dynamically.

For example, if "Bob" starts his computer in the morning and the DHCP server assigns his computer a dynamic IP address, a DNS entry like "bob.example.com" can be associated with that IP address. Even though Bob's IP address may change every time he starts his computer, his DNS name remains the same, allowing users to communicate with Bob's computer without knowing the IP address.

You can also use DDNS to provide static host names for users who connect to the Internet through a modem. An ISP can set up DDNS so that a home computer has the same host name every time it connects.

### Chapter 3: IP Firewall Service

**Firewall service** is software that protects the network applications running on your Mac OS X Server. Turning on firewall service is similar to erecting a wall to limit access. The firewall service scans incoming IP packets and rejects or accepts them based on the set of filters you create. You can restrict access to any IP service running on the server and customize filters for all incoming clients or for a range of client IP addresses.

The illustration below shows an example of a firewall process:

1. A computer with IP address 10.221.41.33 attempts to connect to the server over the Internet (port 80).
2. The server begins looking for filters.
3. Is there a filter for port 80?
   - Yes: Connection is refused.
   - No: Locate the Any Port filter with the most specific range that includes the address 10.221.41.33.
4. Is there a filter containing IP address 10.221.41.33?
   - Yes: What does the filter specify?
     - Allow: Connection is made.
     - Deny: Connection is refused.

**LL2351.Book  Page 43  Monday, September 8, 2003  2:47 PM**

### Chapter 3: IP Firewall Service

Services such as Web and FTP are identified on your server by a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or User Datagram Protocol (UDP) port number. When a computer tries to connect to a service, the firewall service scans the filter list for a matching port number.

- **If the port number is in the filter list**, the filter applied is the one that contains the most specific address range.
- **If the port number is not in the list**, the Default filter that contains the most specific address range is used.

The port filters you create are applied to TCP packets and can also be applied to UDP packets. Additionally, you can set up filters for restricting Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP), Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP), and NetInfo data.

If you plan to share data over the Internet and do not have a dedicated router or firewall to protect your data from unauthorized access, you should use the firewall service. This service works well for small to medium businesses, schools, and small or home offices.

Large organizations with a firewall can use the firewall service to exercise a finer degree of control over their servers. For example, individual workgroups within a large business or schools within a school system may want to use the firewall service to control access to their own servers.

IP Firewall also provides stateful packet inspection, which determines whether an incoming packet is a legitimate response to an outgoing request or part of an ongoing session, allowing packets that would otherwise be denied.

Mac OS X Server uses the application `ipfw` for firewall service.

**Important:** When you start the firewall service for the first time, most incoming TCP packets are denied until you change the filters to allow access. By default, only the ports essential to remote administration are available, including Remote Directory Access (625), Server Administration via Server Admin (687), and Secure Shell (22). For any other network service, you must create filters to allow access to your server. If you turn off the firewall service, all addresses are allowed access to your server.

**LL2351.Book  Page 44  Monday, September 8, 2003  2:47 PM**

### Understanding Firewall Filters

When you start the firewall service, the default configuration denies access to all incoming packets from remote computers except for ports used for remote configuration. This provides a high level of security. You can then add new IP filters to allow server access to those clients who require access to services.

To learn how IP filters work, read the following section. To learn how to create IP filters, see “Managing Firewall Service” on page 49.

#### What is a Filter?

A filter is made up of an IP address and a subnet mask, and sometimes a port number and access type. The IP address and the subnet mask together determine the range of IP addresses to which the filter applies and can be set to apply to all addresses.

- **IP Address**: IP addresses consist of four segments with values between 0 and 255, separated by dots (e.g., 192.168.12.12). The segments go from general to specific (e.g., the first segment might belong to all the computers in a whole company, and the last segment might belong to a specific computer on one floor of a building).
- **Subnet Mask**: A subnet mask indicates which segments in the specified IP address can vary on a given network and by how much. The subnet mask is given in Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation. It consists of the IP address followed by a slash (/) and a number from 1 to 32, called the IP prefix. An IP prefix identifies the number of significant bits used to identify a network.

For example, 192.168.2.1 /16 means the first 16 bits (the first two numbers separated by periods) are used to represent the network (every machine on the network begins with 192.168), and the remaining 16 bits (the last two numbers separated by periods) are used to identify hosts (each machine has a unique set of trailing numbers).

### Chapter 3: IP Firewall Service

#### Using Address Ranges

When you create filters using **Server Admin**, you enter an IP address and the CIDR format subnet mask. **Server Admin** shows you the resulting address range, and you can change the range by modifying the subnet mask. When you indicate a range of possible values for any segment of an address, that segment is called a wildcard. The following table gives examples of address ranges created to achieve specific goals.

| Goal | Sample IP Address | Enter This in the Address Field | Address Range Affected |
|------|-------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------|
| Create a filter that specifies a single IP address. | 10.221.41.33 | 10.221.41.33 or 10.221.41.33/32 | 10.221.41.33 (single address) |
| Create a filter that leaves the fourth segment as a wildcard. | 10.221.41.33 | 10.221.41.33/24 | 10.221.41.0 to 10.221.41.255 |
| Create a filter that leaves part of the third segment and all of the fourth segment as a wildcard. | 10.221.41.33 | 10.221.41.33/22 | 10.221.40.0 to 10.221.43.255 |
| Create a filter that applies to all incoming addresses. | Select "Any" | All IP addresses | All IP addresses |

**LL2351.Book  Page 47  Monday, September 8, 2003  2:47 PM**

### Setting Up Firewall Service for the First Time

Once you have decided which filters you need to create, follow these steps to set up the firewall service. If you need more help, see “Managing Firewall Service” on page 49 and the other topics referred to in the steps.

#### Step 1: Learn and Plan

If you are new to working with IP Firewall, learn and understand firewall concepts, tools, and features of Mac OS X Server and BIND. For more information, see “Understanding Firewall Filters” on page 45.

Then, plan your IP Firewall Service by determining which services you want to provide access to. Mail, web, and FTP services generally require access from computers on the Internet, while file and print services will likely be restricted to your local subnet. Once you decide which services you want to protect using the firewall service, determine which IP addresses you want to allow access to your server and which IP addresses you want to deny access to your server. Then, create the appropriate filters.

#### Step 2: Start Firewall Service

In **Server Admin**, select **Firewall** and click **Start Service**. By default, this blocks all incoming ports except those used to configure the server remotely. If you are configuring the server locally, turn off external access immediately.

#### Step 3: Create an IP Address Group That Filters Will Apply To
