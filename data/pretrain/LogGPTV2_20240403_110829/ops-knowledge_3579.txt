User: I am running a python script of web2py and want to log its output. I am using following command
nohup python /var/www/web2py/web2py.py -S cloud -M -N -R applications/cloud/private/process.py >>/var/log/web2pyserver.log 2>&1 &
The process is running but it is not logging into the file. I have tried without nohup also but it is still same.
The default logging of nohup in nohup.out is also not working.
Any suggestion what might be going wrong?
Assistant: If you've got commas in your print statements there's a good chance it's due to buffering. You can put a sys command (forget which) in your code or when you run the nohup, just add the option -u and you'll disable std(in|out|err) buffering
