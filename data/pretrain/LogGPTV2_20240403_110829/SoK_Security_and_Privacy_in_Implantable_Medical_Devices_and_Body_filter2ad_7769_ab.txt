### Security and Privacy in Implantable Medical Devices (IMDs) and Body Area Networks (BANs)

#### Introduction
While some security mechanisms are mentioned in existing standards, most are optional to ensure interoperability. Foo Kune et al. [34] found that enabling these security mechanisms in conjunction with known security protocols can satisfy the majority of security requirements. The Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) is developing TIR-57, a draft guidance document aimed at standardizing secure Information Technology (IT) practices for clinical environments. As of the time of writing, the draft was not yet available.

#### IV. Security and Privacy in IMDs and BANs
In this section, we first review the security and privacy goals for IMDs and BANs. We then present our adversarial model and discuss potential security threats.

##### A. Security and Privacy Goals
We recognize the following security and privacy goals for IMDs and BANs, building on the models provided by Halperin et al. [14] and Zhang et al. [20]. These properties should be maintained throughout the entire lifecycle of the devices, including the appropriate disposal of explanted devices.

- **Confidentiality**: Data, device information, and device systems should be accessible only to authorized entities, and these entities should be authenticated. Data should remain confidential both in storage and during transmission.
- **Integrity**: Data, device information, and device systems should not be modifiable by unauthorized entities. The system should also ensure data origin authentication, verifying the source of any received data.
- **Availability**: Data, device information, and device systems should be accessible when requested by authorized entities.

IMDs and BANs should also meet the following privacy goals, based on criteria from Halperin et al. [17], Denning et al. [39], and Kumar et al. [40]:

- **Device-existence Privacy**: Unauthorized entities should not be able to determine that a patient has an IMD/BAN.
- **Device-type Privacy**: If device-existence privacy is not possible, unauthorized entities should not be able to determine the type of IMD/BAN in use.
- **Specific-device ID Privacy**: Unauthorized entities should not be able to determine the unique ID of an IMD/BAN sensor.
- **Measurement and Log Privacy**: Unauthorized entities should not be able to access private telemetry or stored data about the patient. System design should include a privacy assessment to determine appropriate data access policies.
- **Bearer Privacy**: Unauthorized entities should not be able to exploit IMD/BAN properties to identify the patient.
- **Tracking**: Unauthorized entities should not be able to track or locate a patient by leveraging the physical layer (e.g., monitoring analog sensors or matching a radio fingerprint [42]–[44]).

##### B. Adversarial Model
Adversaries can be classified based on their goals, capabilities, and relationship to the system:

1. **Active vs. Passive**:
   - **Passive Adversaries**: Can eavesdrop on all communication channels, including side channels.
   - **Active Adversaries**: Can read, modify, and inject data over the communication channel.

2. **External vs. Internal**:
   - **External Adversaries**: Are outsiders with no legitimate role in the system.
   - **Internal Adversaries**: Have a legitimate role (e.g., manufacturer employees, patient, physician, or hospital administrator).

3. **Single Entity vs. Coordinated Group**:
   - **Single Entity**: Acts alone.
   - **Coordinated Group**: Acts as part of a coordinated team.

4. **Sophisticated vs. Unsophisticated**:
   - **Sophisticated Adversaries**: Use specialized, custom equipment.
   - **Unsophisticated Adversaries**: Use readily available commercial equipment.

All system components of IMDs and BANs can be used as attack surfaces. Adversaries may target:

- **The Patient**: To obtain private information or cause physical or psychological harm.
- **The Device or System Manufacturer**: For corporate espionage or fraud.
- **System Resources**: To utilize system resources, possibly unaware of the type of device or network compromised.

##### C. Threats
We classify IMD and BAN security and privacy threats into the following categories:

- **Telemetry Interface**: Typically wireless, threats include eavesdropping, jamming, replay, modification, forgery, and dropping of wireless communications.
- **Software Threats**: Adversaries can alter system logic through software vulnerabilities.
- **Hardware and Sensor Interface Threats**: Adversaries may exploit knowledge of internal hardware architecture or analog sensors to attack the system.

These categories inform our analysis of security and privacy research trends in Section V.

#### V. Medical Device Security and Privacy Trends
We analyze research trends in the literature, grouping them according to the relevant attack surface: the telemetry interface, software, and hardware/sensor inputs. Table I provides an explicit categorization of relevant research with respect to security threats and goals. Due to the extensive work on wireless telemetry threats, we further subdivide these into subclasses. Figure 3 offers an overview of current research, grouped thematically and by publication year.

As Figure 3 indicates, most research focuses on threats to the telemetry interface, with fewer papers addressing software threats. Since very few papers deal with threats to the sensor interface, we defer discussion of this emerging threat to Section VI-C.

##### A. Securing the Wireless Telemetry Interface
Halperin et al. [12] introduced a class of wireless threats against a commercial ICD, and since then, attacks on the telemetry interface of IMDs have received significant attention [18], [78], [79]. At the physical layer, Halperin et al. [12] and Li et al. [18] developed passive and active attacks using off-the-shelf software-defined radio (SDR) platforms. The analyzed devices and programmers do not use authenticated channels and transmit unencrypted data without freshness checks, allowing eavesdropping, replay, and injection attacks.

Many authentication techniques have been proposed to secure the wireless telemetry of IMDs and BANs, including biometrics, distance-bounding authentication, out-of-band authentication, external devices, and anomaly detection. We explore each of these areas individually below.

1. **Biometrics**:
   - Key generation and key agreement in IMDs/BANs often use biometrics or physiological values (PVs) [45], [47], [56], [57], [60], [64], [68], [70]–[72], [74].
   - Electrocardiograms (ECGs) are commonly used as a source of key material, although other PVs such as heart rate, blood glucose, blood pressure, and temperature have been proposed [71].
   - Poon et al. [72] assert that the time between heartbeats (IPI) has a high level of randomness and can be measured anywhere on the body.
   - A typical approach involves both devices taking a measurement of the chosen PV, generating a cryptographic key, and establishing an authenticated channel.
   - Security analyses of these protocols have been mostly ad hoc, and more comprehensive assessments are needed. Rostami et al. [19] demonstrated simple but damaging attacks against OPFKA [47] and IMDGuard [62].
   - Chang et al. [52] explored the issue of noise in real-world measurements, and Rostami et al. [45] presented a more robust IPI-based authentication protocol, considering measurement noise and providing a rigorous security analysis.

2. **Distance-Bounding Protocols**:
   - Distance bounding establishes physical distance between two entities by timing the delay of sent and received transmissions.
   - This technique can be used over various signals such as RF or ultrasonic sound.
   - Several IMD/BAN access control and authentication protocols use distance bounding [18], [48], [52], [54], [65].
   - However, distance bounding alone provides weak authentication, requiring additional techniques to establish identity and authorization.

### Conclusion
This document provides a comprehensive overview of the security and privacy challenges in IMDs and BANs, along with the current research trends and proposed solutions. Future work should focus on addressing the emerging threats and ensuring robust security and privacy in these critical medical devices.
