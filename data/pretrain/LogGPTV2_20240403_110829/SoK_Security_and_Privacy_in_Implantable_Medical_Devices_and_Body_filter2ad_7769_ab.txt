While at least some security mechanisms
are mentioned in these standards, most are optional, pre-
sumably to ensure interoperability. Foo Kune et al. [34] ﬁnd
that by enabling these security mechanisms in combination
with known security protocols, a vast majority of security
requirements could be satisﬁed. The Association for the Ad-
vancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) is working
on TIR-57, a draft guidance document to start standardizing
secure Information Technology (IT) practices for clinical
environments; at the time of this writing, a draft was not
yet available.
IV. SECURITY AND PRIVACY IN IMDS AND BANS
In this section, we ﬁrst review security and privacy goals
for IMDs and BANs. We then present our adversarial model
and discuss security threats.

goals
• Conﬁdentiality: Data, device information, and device
systems should be accessible only to authorized entities
(i.e., appropriate entities) and these entities should be
authenticated (i.e., the identity of entities communicat-
ing with devices should be veriﬁable). In particular, data
should be kept conﬁdential both in storage and while
in transmission.
• Integrity: Data, device information, and device systems
should not be modiﬁable by unauthorized entities. The
system should also satisfy data origin authentication;
the source of any received data should be veriﬁable.
• Availability: Data, device information, and device sys-
tems should be accessible when requested by authorized
entities.
IMDs and BANs should also satisfy the following pri-
vacy goals; we include criteria from Halperin et al. [17],
Denning et al. [39], and Kumar et al. [40] for completeness.
Although these goals bear some overlap with conﬁdentiality,
we include the full
in order to allow for a more
comprehensive treatment of privacy (apart from security) in
the context of IMDs and BANs. We refer the reader to the
work of Avancha et al [41] for a policy-oriented treatment
of privacy issues in health-related mobile technology.
list
• Device-existence privacy: Unauthorized entities should
not be able to determine that a patient has an
IMD/BAN.
• Device-type privacy: If device-existence privacy is not
possible, unauthorized entities should not be able to
determine what type of IMD/BAN is in use.
527
• Speciﬁc-device
ID privacy: Unauthorized entities
should not be able to determine the unique ID of an
IMD/BAN sensor.
• Measurement and log privacy: Unauthorized entities
should not be able to determine private telemetry or
access stored data about the patient. The system design
phase should include a privacy assessment to determine
appropriate policies with respect to data access.
• Bearer privacy: Unauthorized entities should not be
able to exploit IMD/BAN properties to identify the
patient.
• Tracking: Unauthorized entities should not be able to
leverage the physical layer (e.g., by monitoring analog
sensors or matching a radio ﬁngerprint [42]–[44]) to
track or locate a patient.
B. Adversarial Model
Following the standard approach in computer security
literature, adversaries may be distinguished based on their
goals, capabilities, and relationship to the system in question.
We have the following classiﬁcation criteria.
1) An adversary is either active or passive:
• Passive adversaries are able to eavesdrop on all com-
munication channels in the network, including side
channels, or unintentional communication channels.
• Active adversaries are able to read, modify, and inject
data over the communication channel.
2) An adversary is either an external or internal entity with
respect to the system. That is, an adversary may either
be an outsider or an insider with a legitimate system
role (e.g., manufacturer employees, patient, physician,
or hospital administrator).
3) An adversary may be either a single entity or a member
of a coordinated group of entities.
4) An adversary may be sophisticated, relying on spe-
cialized, custom equipment, or unsophisticated, relying
only on readily available commercial equipment.
All system components of IMDs and BANs may be used
as attack surfaces, or points of potential weakness, by an ad-
versary (e.g., any existing sensors, actuators, communication
networks, or external programming devices). In addition, the
adversary may have the following targets and goals with
respect to the speciﬁed target.
1) The patient: The adversary may wish to obtain pri-
vate information concerning the patient (e.g., where-
abouts, diagnosis, or blackmail-worthy material), or
cause physical or psychological harm to the patient.
2) The device or system manufacturer: The adversary may
wish to engage in corporate espionage or fraud.
3) System resources: The adversary may wish to utilize
system resources and may be unaware of the type of
device or network compromised. That is, the adversary
does not knowingly target an IMD/BAN.

C. Threats
We classify IMD and BAN security and privacy threats
found in the literature into the following categories:
• The telemetry interface, which is typically wireless.
Threats include a passive adversary who eavesdrops on
wireless communications and an active adversary who
attempts to jam, replay, modify, forge, or drop wireless
communications.
• Software threats, which consider an adversary that can
alter the logic of the system (e.g., through software
vulnerabilities) to affect expected operation.
• Hardware and sensor interface threats. An adversary
may have knowledge of the internal hardware architec-
ture or analog sensors and may use that knowledge to
attack the system. Speciﬁcally, sensor threats stem from
the implicit trust that the system places on those sensor
inputs, under the assumption that physical contact with
the sensor is necessary to alter the signal. An active
attacker, however, may introduce remote interference
to sensing in order to affect actuation.
These categories inform our analysis of security and
privacy research trends in Section V.
V. MEDICAL DEVICE SECURITY AND PRIVACY TRENDS
We follow the broad categorization of IMD and BAN
security and privacy threats given in Section IV-C in order
to analyze research trends in the literature. That
is, we
group research according to the relevant attack surface: the
telemetry interface, software, and hardware/sensor inputs.
We give an explicit categorization of relevant research with
respect to security threats and goals in Table I. Due to the
large amount of work on the wireless telemetry threats, we
separate the wireless threats into subclasses. An overview
of current research, grouped thematically and by publication
year, is given in Figure 3.
As Figure 3 indicates, the vast majority of results in the
literature focus on threats to the telemetry interface, while
a limited number of papers consider software threats. Since
very few papers deal with threats to the sensor interface, we
defer discussion of this emerging threat to Section VI-C.
A. Securing the Wireless Telemetry Interface
[12]
Halperin et al.
introduce a class of wireless
threats against a commercial ICD; since then, attacks on
the telemetry interface of IMDs have received a large
amount of attention [18], [78], [79]. At the physical layer,
Halperin et al. [12], targeting an ICD, and Li et al. [18],
targeting an insulin pump system, develop passive and active
attacks against their respective device using an off-the-shelf
software deﬁned radio (SDR) platform. In the devices and
programmers analyzed,
the communication links do not
use an authenticated channel and transmit unencrypted data
without freshness checks, thereby allowing eavesdropping,
replay [12], and injection attacks [18].
Unsurprisingly, many authentication techniques have been
proposed to secure the wireless telemetry of IMDs and
BANS, including the use of biometrics, distance-bounding
authentication, out-of-band authentication, external devices,
and anomaly detection. We explore each of these areas
individually below.
1) Biometrics: Popular techniques for key generation and
key agreement in IMDs/BANs include the use of biometrics,
or physiological values (PVs) [45], [47], [56], [57], [60],
[64], [68], [70]–[72], [74]. Electrocardiograms (ECGs) are
a common choice as a source of key material in these proto-
cols, although other PVs such as heart rate, blood glucose,
blood pressure, and temperature have been proposed [71].
The choice to use ECGs is motivated by a well-cited paper
by Poon et al. [72], which asserts that the time between
heartbeats, or interpulse interval (IPI), has a high level of
randomness. IPI has the additional beneﬁt that it can be
measured anywhere on the body and many IMDs in use
today can measure IPI without modiﬁcation.
A typical approach to PV-based key agreement between
an IMD and programmer, for example, involves both devices
taking a measurement of the chosen PV. This measured PV is
used to generate a cryptographic key that is agreed upon by
both devices, which is then used to establish an authenticated
channel. The basic assumption is that physical contact (or
at least physical proximity) with the patient is required in
order to precisely measure the chosen PV.
Security analyses of these protocols have been mostly
ad hoc in nature, however, and in general more com-
prehensive assessments are required. For example, Ros-
tami et al. [19] demonstrate simple, but damaging attacks
against OPFKA [47] and IMDGuard [62], which we discuss
in Section V-A4.
Chang et al. [52] also explore the use of IPI, drawing
attention to the issue of noise in real-world measurements.
Later work by Rostami et al. [45] presents a more robust IPI-
based authentication protocol, which unlike previous work,
takes into account both the impact of measurement noise
and provide a more rigorous security analysis. We discuss
the subtleties and potential difﬁculties of using IPI as part
of a key agreement protocol in more detail in Section VI-B
and Section VI-C.
2) Distance-Bounding Protocols: Distance bounding [80]
is a technique that establishes physical distance between two
entities by timing the delay of sent and received transmis-
sions. This distance bound can be computed over various
signals such as RF or ultrasonic sound (which is an acoustic
signal above 20 kHz). A number of IMD/BAN access control
and authentication protocols use distance bounding [18],
[48], [52], [54], [65]. However, distance bounding by itself
provides for only weak authentication, in which physical
proximity between devices is established but identity and
authorization are not, thereby requiring the use of additional
authentication techniques.
