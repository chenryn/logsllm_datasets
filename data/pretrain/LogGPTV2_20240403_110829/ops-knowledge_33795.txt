User: How to use Ansible automation tool to manage configuration and deployment of multiple servers?
Assistant: The configuration and deployment of multiple servers can be easily managed with Ansible. The following are the steps to use Ansible automation tool to manage multiple servers: 1. Install Ansible: First, you need to install Ansible, which can be downloaded from the official website or installed using a package manager. 2. Create the Ansible configuration file: Create the Ansible configuration file ansible.cfg on the Ansible master machine. In this file, you can set the default host inventory, log settings, etc. 3. Set up the host list: Create a host list file hosts on the Ansible master machine, which defines the IP addresses or host names of all servers that need to be managed. It is also possible to store hostnames and IP addresses on DNS or LDAP servers. 4. Create Ansible playbook: Use Ansible playbook files to define the tasks and steps to be setup and deployed. Playbook files define hosts and groups, tasks, variables and modules. Tasks can be implemented using any of the available Ansible modules. Playbook files are written using the YAML language. 5. Execute Playbook: Use the ansible-playbook command to execute the Playbook file, which will transfer the Playbook file to all managed hosts. Ansible automatically executes the tasks and actions defined in the Playbook file. The advantages of Ansible include ease of use, scalability, high performance, security and reliability, and strong traceability. The configuration and deployment of multiple servers can be easily managed by using the Ansible automation tool.
