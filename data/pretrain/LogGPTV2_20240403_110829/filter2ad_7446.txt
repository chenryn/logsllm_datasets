ABSTRACT
This panel will explore how security topics are integrated into
academic programs and future directions for improvements. It will
address how early in time security should be introduced in programs
like computer science and software engineering; and identify the
critical takeaways that each graduating student should learn. We
will try to separate out the important, practical concepts from the
purely academic ones. We will also consider how well security
programs translate to industry-focused needs: do students emerge
with an understanding that is both deep and broad enough to be
useful? In general, we will try to identify the pitfalls of current
security education and how we can move forward as an academic
community, in tandem with industry and government.

storage and embedded systems, mobile security and privacy, and
cloud security. He also has interests in Internet security and applied
cryptography.
Kevin received his Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering
from the Pennsylvania State University in 2010, an M.S. in Elec-
trical Engineering from Columbia University in 2004, and a B.Sc.
in Electrical Engineering from Queen’s University at Kingston in
1999. He received the National Science Foundation CAREER award
in 2013 and the Symantec Research Labs Graduate Fellowship in
2009.
Robert K. Cunningham. Dr. Robert K. Cunningham is the As-
sociate Director of Cyber Assurance in the CERT Division at the
Software Engineering Institute and is an Adjunct professor of Cy-
bersecurity at the Institute for Software Research in the School of
Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. Previously, Dr.
Cunningham worked at Raytheon (1985-87), and at MIT Lincoln
Laboratory, where he led multiple Groups performing research and
engineering in cyber resilience and computer security (1998-2018).
He founded IEEE Cybersecurity Development (SecDev) and has
chaired IEEE RAID and IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy.
His 2001 network defense work with the National Security Agency
earned the director’s commendation. He has served on I3P’s execu-
tive committee, IARPA’s (then ARDA) executive advisory board, the
U.S. Department of Defense’s Priority Steering Council on Cyber
Security Research and Development, the U.S. Army Cyber Materiel
Development Strategy Review Panel, and chaired the IEEE Cyber-
security Initiative.
Dr. Cunningham received an ScB degree in computer engineer-
ing from Brown University in 1985, an MS degree in electrical
engineering from Boston University in 1988, and a PhD degree in
cognitive and neural systems from Boston University in 1998.
Paul C. Van Oorschot. Paul C. Van Oorschot is a Professor of Com-
puter Science at Carleton University (Ottawa), where he is Canada
Research Chair in Authentication and Computer Security. He is an
ACM Fellow, and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada (FRSC),
Canada’s national academy. He was Program Chair of NSPW 2014-
2015, USENIX Security 2008, NDSS 2001-2002, and co-author of the
Handbook of Applied Cryptography (1996). He has served on the
editorial boards of IEEE TDSC, IEEE TIFS, and ACM TISSEC/TOPS.
His research interests include authentication and identity manage-
ment, computer security, Internet security, security and usability,
software security, and applied cryptography.

for Security, Privacy and Information Assurance at the Univer-
sity of Calgary. Before joining the University of Calgary in 2007
as the iCORE Chair in Information Security, she was a Professor
of Computer Science and the Director of Telecommunication and
Information Technology Research Institute (now ICT Research In-
stitute) at the University of Wollongong Australia.
She has over 300 refereed publications, has served as an Asso-
ciate Editor of IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, ACM
Transactions on Information and System Security (TISSEC), and
is currently an Associate Editor of IEEE Transactions on Secure
and Dependable Computing, IET Information Security and Journal
of Mathematical Cryptology. She has served as Program Chair/co-
Chair of numerous conferences, most recently, ACM CCSW 2014,
Financial Cryptography 2014, ACNS 2013 and Crypto 2012. She is a
member of the Steering Committee of International Conference in
Information Theoretic Security and ACM CCS Cloud Computing
Security Workshop.
Rei has a PhD in Electrical Engineering from University of Wa-
terloo, Canada. Her current research interests are cryptography,
information theoretic security, quantum-safe cryptography, net-
work and communication security and privacy, and Cloud security
and privacy.
