User: I decided to rewrite all our Bash scripts in Python (there are not so many of them) as my first Python project. The reason for it is that although being quite fluent in Bash I feel it's somewhat archaic language and since our system is in the first stages of its developments I think switching to Python now will be the right thing to do.
Are there scripts that should always be written in Bash? For example, we have an init.d daemon script - is it OK to use Python for it?
We run CentOS.
Thanks.
Assistant: Every task has languages that are better suited for it and less so. Replacing the backtick ` quote of sh is pretty ponderous in Python as would be myriad quoting details, just to name a couple. There are likely better projects to cut your teeth on.
And all that they said above about Python being relatively heavyweight and not necessarily available when needed.
