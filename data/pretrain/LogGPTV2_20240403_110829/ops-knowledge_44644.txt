User: Virtualenv is great: it lets me keep a number of distinct Python installations so that different projects' dependencies aren't all thrown together into a common pile.
But if I want to install a package on Windows that's packaged as a .exe installer, how can I direct it to install into the virtualenv?  For example, I have pycuda-0.94rc.win32-py2.6.exe.  When I run it, it examines the registry, and finds only one Python26 to install into, the common one that my virtualenv is based off of.
How can I direct it to install into the virtualenv?
Assistant: easy_install is able to install .exe packages as long as they were built using distutils' bdist_wininst target, which covers many popular packages. However, there are many others that aren't (wxPython is one that I've struggled with)
