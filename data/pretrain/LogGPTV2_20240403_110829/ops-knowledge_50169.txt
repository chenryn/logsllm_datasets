User: In the Linux environment, use iptables to configure a rule so that all requests to port 80 are redirected to port 8080.
Assistant: You can use the following command: iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8080 This command will add a rule to the PREROUTING chain of the nat table, matching port 80 of the TCP protocol traffic and redirect it to port 8080. Note that when using this command, it needs to be executed as the root user.
