### Data Collection and Analysis

For the purpose of later data analysis, one case manager interview was not audio recorded as per the interviewee's request. Instead, a detailed set of notes was taken by an interviewer, which served as the basis for subsequent data analysis. All interviews were conducted in English, a language in which all participants were fluent, and typically lasted between 1 to 2 hours. We continued conducting interviews until thematic saturation was achieved, at which point we transitioned to focus groups with refugees to validate and complement the perspectives provided by teachers and case managers.

### Participant Observations

By soliciting observations from teachers and case managers about their clients, we gained a comprehensive understanding of refugees' technology usage and threat models. Case managers typically managed between 42 and 50 clients, while class sizes for teachers ranged from 12 to 34 students. After accounting for the overlap between different case managers and teachers, we conservatively estimate that our discussions covered approximately 150 refugees from 22 countries, with the most common origins being Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iraq, Somalia, and Syria. Given the extensive experience of the case managers and teachers, their insights likely reflected a much larger pool of refugees. Additionally, four out of the five case managers were themselves refugees, providing both personal and professional perspectives on the experiences of their clients.

### Interview Topics and Context

Driven by the research questions outlined in Section III, each interview covered broad topics including technology usage, threat models, and technology education. These topics were explored in the context of refugees' current lives in the U.S. and their past experiences, including time spent in refugee camps, home countries, and intermediary countries. We allowed participants to bring up security and privacy issues organically; if they did not, we introduced these topics halfway through the interview.

We acknowledge that the views of case managers and ESL teachers may be biased towards refugees who are not yet employed or lack the technological and English skills necessary for independent job-seeking. However, this sub-population—refugees with weaker English and technology skills—is a critical group to support.

### Focus Groups with Refugees

To complement the insights from case managers and teachers, we conducted three focus groups with refugees. Each focus group included two researchers and a professional interpreter, and the sessions were audio recorded and transcribed for later analysis. We chose focus groups over semi-structured one-on-one interviews because they allow for more natural and free-flowing conversations among participants, creating a less intimidating environment where refugees can share according to the norms of their peer group.

The first focus group involved four Syrian refugees (R1a-d), and the second and third groups each included five Somali refugees (R2a-e, R3a-e). To facilitate comfortable discussions, we asked participants to arrive in groups with whom they were already familiar, such as families or friends. This approach, however, resulted in a lack of diversity; for example, all ten Somali participants were female, consistent with the observation that most of the clients of case managers and teachers were female.

### Data Analysis Methodology

To categorize and synthesize the data from our interviews, we developed a hierarchical codebook through several rounds of coding, starting with open codes and then combining them into axial codes. Each interview was coded by two members of the research team, with one primary coder who coded every interview. Intercoder agreement was high, with an average Cohen’s Kappa score of .98. In cases of disagreement, the primary coder's codes were used.

For the focus groups, reported numbers reflect the lower bounds of participant views, as some participants may agree without explicitly stating their opinions. Due to the multiple voices in the audio recordings, especially during discussions in native languages, it was sometimes challenging to attribute specific comments to individual participants. Therefore, the researchers developed a consensus on themes across the full group and, when reporting, worked to attribute specific statements to individual participants.

### Ethical Considerations

Our study protocol was approved by our institution’s Institutional Review Board (IRB). Given the vulnerability of the population, we took steps to protect participants' privacy and ensure ethical treatment. We did not collect unnecessary personally identifying information, asked participants to anonymize names in their stories, and redacted names and other personal details in transcripts. With explicit consent, we audio recorded all interviews except one, where the participant was uncomfortable with recording.

In developing the interview and focus group protocols, we focused on technology use and avoided sensitive or emotionally difficult topics. Participants were not required to answer any questions, and some chose not to. In presenting our results, we do not name the NGO from which we drew participants and omit some details, such as gender, to prevent deanonymization.

### Results

#### Technology Use Among Refugees

We begin by examining the technologies that refugees use, their relationships with case managers and teachers, and their life goals. These findings provide context for later subsections, where we also consider how these relationships and goals influence their technology use and computer security behaviors.

**Technology Use:**
There is a clear dichotomy between refugees who are fluent with technology and those who are not. Overall, prior email usage is low. Despite varying technical and educational backgrounds, their life goals in the U.S. are similar.

**Experience with Technology Prior to the U.S.:**
Case managers and teachers observed a significant divide between refugees who are comfortable with phones and computers and those who are not. The former group, typically from modern cities, are well-versed in smartphones, social media, and messaging apps but may lack email experience. These refugees often come from wealthier countries like Syria or Iraq and some Ethiopian cities. In contrast, refugees from rural areas or refugee camps have little to no experience with technology, and some have never used a computer or mouse before.

**Current Technology Use in the U.S.:**
Most refugees do not have computers at home, leading them to use public or shared computers at libraries, community centers, or local NGOs for tasks like job searches and applications. This raises potential security concerns due to the shared nature of these computers. All teachers and case managers noted that most refugees own smartphones, which serve as their primary connection to the digital world. Table II summarizes the most common smartphone uses, including communication via WhatsApp, Viber, and Facebook, navigation, translation, and storing photos of important documents.

**Role of Case Managers and Teachers:**
Refugees must trust their case managers and teachers to leverage their knowledge and services, but this trust also exposes them to potential vulnerabilities. Case managers help refugees settle into their new lives, primarily by assisting with job placement. They must collect sensitive information, adhering to strict confidentiality agreements. While teachers and case managers trust their colleagues, some refugees may struggle with trust due to past traumas. This trust relationship extends to the digital domain, a topic we explore further in Section V-C.

### Conclusion

This section provides a comprehensive overview of the data collection, analysis, and key findings from our study on refugees' technology usage and security practices. Future work could delve deeper into the specific issues faced by refugees and compare them with other immigrant groups to better understand the unique challenges and solutions.
