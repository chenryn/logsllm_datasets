for later data analysis. One case manager interview was not
audio recorded because the interviewee did not wish to be
recorded; one interviewer took detailed notes, which served
as the basis for that interview’s later data analysis. Interviews
were conducted in English, in which all participants were
ﬂuent, and lasted 1-2 hours. We conducted interviews until
reaching thematic saturation, and then turned to focus groups
of refugees to corroborate and complement the teachers’ and
case managers’ perspectives.
By asking teachers and case managers for their observations
of their clients, we elicited a broad view of refugees’ technol-
ogy usage and threat models: case managers had between 42
and 50 clients, and class size for teachers varied from 12 to 34
clients. After accounting for the overlap between teachers and
different case managers, we conservatively estimate that we
talked about approximately 150 refugees from 22 countries,
with the most common countries being Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iraq,
Somalia, and Syria. Since the case managers and teachers drew
on many years of experience, they likely drew their answers
from experiences with a far greater number of refugees.
Additionally, four of the ﬁve case managers were themselves
refugees, and provide personal insight into refugees’ views as
well as a high level view of their clients’.
Driven by the research questions in Section III, each inter-
view covered the following broad topics: technology usage,
threat models, and technology education. We asked about
each of these topics in the context of both refugees’ lives
currently in the US and — to develop an understanding of
why refugees might have whatever practices and beliefs they
currently have — we asked about each of these topics in
the context of their lives prior to the US, including time
spent in refugee camps, home countries, and any intermediary
countries. We waited for participants to bring up security and
privacy organically; if they did not, we brought it up about
halfway into the interview.
We note that case managers’ and ESL teachers’ view of
refugees may be skewed towards those who do not yet have
jobs, or who do not have the technological or English skills
to independently get a job yet; therefore our results are biased
to apply more strongly to the population of refugees with
weaker English and technology skills. However,
this sub-
population — refugees who do not have jobs or are not ﬂuent
with technology — is a critical population to assist.
Focus groups with refugees. To complement the case man-
agers’ and teachers’ interviews, we conducted three focus
groups with refugees. All focus groups had two researchers
and a professional
interpreter, and the focus groups were
audio recorded and transcribed for later data analysis. We
chose to use focus groups with the refugees, instead of semi-
structured one-on-one interviews, because focus groups —
unlike interviews — would allow refugees the opportunity for
free-ﬂowing conversations amongst themselves, and because
we wanted to create a non-intimidating environment where the

refugees could follow the norms of their peer group regarding
what to share.
The ﬁrst focus group was with four Syrian refugees (R1a-
d), and the second and third groups were each with ﬁve
Somali refugees (R2a-e, R3a-e). To facilitate discussions,
we asked participants to arrive in groups with whom they
were already comfortable (e.g., families or friends). However,
asking participants to arrive in groups resulted in a lack of
diversity. For example, the Somali subjects spanned multiple
generations, but all ten were female, commensurate with most
case managers’ and teachers’ observations that most of their
clients were female (T1, T3, CM1, CM2, CM3, CM4).
Interviewing Syrians and Somalis allowed us to speak to
refugees who represented the majority of the clients that the
case managers and teachers were discussing.
Data analysis. To categorize and coalesce the data from our
interviews, we iteratively developed a codebook with hierar-
chical descriptive codes through several rounds of coding, ﬁrst
using open codes, and then combining them to create axial
codes. Each interview was then coded by two members of
the research team, one of whom coded every interview (the
primary coder). Intercoder agreement was high: using Cohen’s
Kappa, a standard measure for two coders, our average inter-
coder agreement was .98. When we report raw numbers in this
paper, we use numbers based on the primary coder’s codes in
the case of (rare) disagreement between coders.
For the focus groups, when reporting on the number of
people who mention a topic, the reported numbers will be
lower bounds on the views of the participants since, if one
participant says something and another agrees, that second
participant may not say anything. Additionally, because each
audio recording reﬂected multiple voices, particularly when
refugees had a discussion in their native language which
was then summarized by the interpreter, it is in some cases
difﬁcult to attribute individual comments to speciﬁc partic-
ipants. Instead of coding for each refugee, the researchers
developed a consensus on all themes across the full group and,
when reported on in this paper, worked to attribute speciﬁc
statements to individual participants.
Human subjects and ethics. Our entire study protocol was
approved by our institution’s IRB. Because we were working
with a vulnerable population, we took care to design our study
to protect participants’ privacy and treat our subjects ethically.
We did not unnecessarily collect personally identifying infor-
mation, we asked participants to anonymize names in their
own stories, and we redacted names and other personal details
in our transcripts. With explicit consent, we audio recorded
all interviews except for one, because the participant was not
comfortable with it.
In developing the interview and focus group protocols, we
focused on technology use as much as possible and avoided
asking about potentially sensitive or emotionally difﬁcult
topics. Participants were explicitly not required to answer
questions (and some exercised the option not to answer).
In presenting our results, we do not name the NGO from
which we drew participants, and we omit some details (such
as gender) so that they cannot deanonymize each other.
V. RESULTS
We now turn to the results from our interviews with case
managers and teachers, as well as our focus groups with
refugees. We organize our results around the four core research
questions raised in Section III: (1) How do refugees use
technology as they settle in the US, and how might their
relationships and life goals inﬂuence that use (Section V-A),
(2) What barriers inhibit the implementation of strong security
and privacy practices among refugees (Section V-B), (3) What
computer security and privacy practices do refugees have
(Section V-C), and (4) What do refugees learn (e.g., from case
managers and teachers) about computer security and privacy
(Section V-D).
A. Refugees and Technology
We begin by considering the technologies that refugees
use (Section V-A1), their relationships with case managers
and teachers (Section V-A2) and others in their community
(Section V-A3), and their life goals (Section V-A4). These
ﬁndings provide context for later subsections, in which we
also consider how those relationships and goals might interface
with their technology use and computer security behaviors.
Some results, such as those about technology use, may apply
to groups beyond refugees, such as non-refugee immigrants
from the same regions. Other results, such as those about
refugees’ relationships with their case managers and teachers,
are more speciﬁc to refugees. Future work could explore these
issues more deeply, to better understand which issues are
inherent to refugees, and which issues are faced by other
groups.
1) TECHNOLOGY USE
Overall, we ﬁnd that there is a dichotomy between refugees
who are ﬂuent using technology, and refugees who are not.
Over both groups, prior email usage is low. Despite the
diversity in technical and educational backgrounds, the goals
for their lives are similar now that they are in the US.
Experience with technology prior to the US. T4 and CM3
observed a clear division between refugees who use phones
and computers ﬂuently, and refugees who are much less tech
literate. The ﬁrst group is typically refugees from modern
cities who are comfortable with technology, smartphones,
computers, have social media, and are well-versed in mes-
saging and VoIP apps but still may not have experience with
email (CM3). These refugees are likely to be from wealthier
countries like Syria or Iraq, and some from larger cities in
Ethiopia (CM1, CM3).
In contrast, refugees who grew up in rural areas or spent
many years in refugee camps have little to no experience with
technology. Some have never used a computer or a mouse
before: “Somebody that comes from a refugee camp. . . you
have to explain to them what e-mail is, what does it do for

you? How do you communicate with people that you don’t
see, but you’re still talking, e-mail. What kind of information
should I share with them?” (CM3). This quote also points to
circular issues around teaching email and information security
and privacy to refugees whose mental models of computers
and the internet are not well-developed.
While some refugees have not used a computer before,
many do arrive in the US familiar with smartphones (T3,
T4, CM2, CM3). In both groups, refugees were unlikely to
have email addresses; instead, refugees with more technical
experience used apps like WhatsApp and Viber (CM2).
The majority of refugees that the teachers and case man-
agers spoke about were in the latter group — uncomfortable
using computers, and with a varying amount of smartphone
experience. Refugees in the focus groups were more tech-
nologically proﬁcient. We hypothesize that this difference is
due to the country of origin for the ﬁrst group (Syria), and
the length of time in the US for the second and third groups
(Somalia). (Table I summarizes these demographics.) This sup-
ports the case managers’ and teachers’ view of Syrians having
more experience with computers, and shows that refugees who
may enter with less tech ﬂuency, such as Somalis, go on to
incorporate technology in their daily lives after living in the
US for years — suggesting that teaching computer security and
privacy practices is critical early on.
Tech use in the US: Computers. Teachers and case managers
said their clients typically do not have computers at home
(except some Iraqi and Syrian families). Thus, the majority of
their computer usage is on public or shared computers, e.g.,
at a library, a community center, or in a computer room in a
local NGO (T1, T2, T3, T4, CM2, CM4). Refugees use these
shared computers for job searches and job applications, raising
potential security concerns for their personal information due
to the shared nature of public computers. These practices
have implications for both the administrators of the machines
and teachers and case managers who are teaching computer
etiquette and security.
Tech use in the US: Smartphones. All teachers and case
managers said that most if not all of their clients have smart-
phones; all the refugees in our focus groups had smartphones.
Because many refugees own smartphones, but not computers,
it is important to understand that their smartphones are the
connection to their digital lives.
Table II shows the most common smartphone uses, includ-
ing connecting with family and friends abroad via WhatsApp,
Viber, and Facebook (among other platforms): “I like to use
Facebook to communicate with my parents and my family
members back home. . . If the apps were not there, I would
have to buy phone cards and call people overseas, but now
because of the technology and the apps, it’s easier for me to
communicate without purchasing those phone cards” (R3c).
They also use smartphones for everyday tasks like navigation,
translation, and storing photos of important documents, a
practice that we will return to in Section V-C.
Notably, we have put “email” in the “other” category in
Table II, since teachers and case managers told us that a main
use of email for refugees is to contact potential and current
employers (T4, CM2, CM4, CM5), and, depending on the
refugee’s English level, they may wait for their case manager
to help respond (CM3). Although one case manager observed
that refugees may also get personal emails, this case manager
was adamant that case managers should ignore those emails
when accessing a clients’ account to help with job-related
activities (CM5); we return to a deeper discussion of email
use in Section V-C.
2) ROLE OF CASE MANAGERS AND TEACHERS
Refugees must trust their teachers and case managers in
order to leverage their knowledge and services, but this also
puts them at risk, since in doing so they must
the
security measures of every person or organization they give
their information to. While case managers and teachers gave
us every reason to think they were trustworthy, there is always
the potential for mistakes or for a malicious insider — making
this requirement to give out information a signiﬁcant and
unavoidable potential vulnerability for refugees.
trust
Case managers help refugees settle into their lives in the US;
the main responsibility of the case managers we interviewed
was helping their clients ﬁnd a job. Because their employer
(the NGO) requires it, case managers must collect sensitive
and personal information from clients such as photocopies of
their social security card and ﬁrst paycheck, but are required
to adhere to strict conﬁdentiality agreements (CM1, CM2).
Teachers and case managers indicated that they trust their
colleagues completely, and that their clients should as well.
However, T2 said that refugees sometimes do not trust their
case managers with their personal information; T2 attributed
this to trauma from their past. “It’s not every day, it’s kind of
like a wave, where one day they’re totally ﬁne with their case
manager and the next day it’s like, ‘I don’t know this person,
I don’t trust them.’ ” This causes problems for both refugees
and case managers because refugees have to share sensitive
information with their case managers in order to get the case
manager’s help. This trust relationship with teachers and case
managers extends to trust in the digital domain, a topic we
return to in Section V-C.
Teachers do not have as much interaction with clients
that revolves around their own personal information. At the
