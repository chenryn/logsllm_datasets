Challenge Bonfire: Search and Replace has an issue.

Please describe how to reproduce this issue, and include links to screenshots
if possible.
The default code uses a "myReplace" function name, however the assertions by
default run against a "replace" function name. Thus either the default
assertions or the default boilerplate code must be altered to run against the
correct default function name.
My code:
    function myReplace(str, before, after) {
     return str;
    }
    myReplace("A quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog", "jumped", "leaped");
