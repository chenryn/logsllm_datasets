go version 1.5.3
Suppose a directory Documents/ has sub-directories A/, B/, C/, and files a, b,
c
URL in address bar: **http://localhost/Documents/**
Everything is okay
URL in address bar: **http://localhost/Documents**
Sub-directory's href is " **http://localhost/A/** ", NOT "
**http://localhost/Documents/A/** ".
So do other sub-directories and files.

Why is the **redirect** flag in **serveFile(w, r, Dir(dir), file, false)** set
to be false?
What's the difference between ServeFile and FileServer except that FileServer
will add "/" for directories and remove "/" for files?
As suggestion, I hope that ServeFile won't show directory structure. It only
serves files.
## Edited
Code: http://130.211.241.67:3000/test.go
The following 2 URLs has the same html output. But as two URLs have different
endings, broswer generates different links.  
http://130.211.241.67:3000/test
http://130.211.241.67:3000/test/
Just click "testFile"
The ServeFile function doesn't redirect directory URLs ends without "/" to
right place.
If ServeFile redirects, there are no difference between ServeFile and
FileServer.

So I wonder how to modify it.
