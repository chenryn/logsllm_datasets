User: In network architecture, what is a subnet mask? How to set the correct subnet mask?
Assistant: A subnet mask is a mask used to determine which fields of a network represent network addresses and which fields represent host addresses. It is a marking method used to divide an IP address into two parts: a network address and a host address. The correct subnet mask setting depends on the size and requirements of the network. A subnet mask consists of 32 bits, which divides the IP address into two parts according to the network number and the host number. Common subnet masks are: 255.0.0.0, 255.255.0.0, and 255.255.255.0, which are suitable for large, medium and small networks respectively. Usually, the subnet mask needs to be set according to actual needs to ensure that the allocation and use of network addresses are reasonable. At the same time, it is also necessary to consider the compatibility of the subnet mask and network equipment to avoid network abnormalities.
