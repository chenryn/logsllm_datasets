!  It’s not easy to !nd “big” numbers in memory 
!  Shellcode chunks are big numbers 
!  Example: looking for 0x01020304: 
!  In short, not many large numbers in memory

!  Scan memory regions in ELF: 
!  RO segment (contains .text, .rodata, …) is a good candidate: 
!  Read only so should not change at runtime 
!  If not PIE, addresses are constant 
!  Keep track of all numbers found and their addresses 
!  Find the best combination of numbers which add up to a chunk

!  This is called the coin change problem 
!  If I buy an item at 4.25€ and pay with a 5€ note 
!  What’s the most e"cient way to return change? 
!  0.75€ change: 
!  1 50 cent coin  
!  1 20 cent coin 
!  1 5 cent coin

!  In dollars, answer is di$erent 
!  0.75$: 
!  1 half-dollar coin 
!  1 quarter 
!  Best solution depends on the coin set 
!  Our set of coins are the numbers found in memory

!  Ideal solution to the problem is using Dynamic Programming: 
!  Finds most e"cient solution 
!  Blows memory for big numbers 
!  I can’t scale it for big numbers yet 
!  Sub-optimal solution is the greedy approach: 
!  No memory footprint 
!  Can miss the solution 
!  Look for the biggest coin which !ts, then go down 
!  Luckily small numbers are easy to !nd in memory

!  Cut and order 4 byte shellcode chunks
!  Add numbers found in memory together until you reach a chunk 
!  Once a chunk is reached, dump it to a stack frame 
!  Repeat until shellcode is complete 
!  Transfer control to shellcode 
!  Git it at https://github.com/alexmgr/numstitch

!  What it does: 
!  Takes an input shellcode, and a frame address 
!  Takes care of the tedious details (endianess, 2’s complement, padding, … ) 
!  Spits out some python code to generate your payload 
!  Additional features: 
!  Add an mprotect RWE stub frame before your stack 
!  Start with an arbitrary accumulator register value 
!  Lookup numbers in section or segments

Pros and cons 
Cisco Con!dential

© 2013-2014  Cisco and/or its a"liates. All rights reserved. 
!  Pros: 
!  Can encode any shellcode (no null-byte problem) 
!  All numbers co-located in a particular address range. Depending on the 
segment chosen, can allow control of encoding in some way 
!  Lower 2 bytes can be controlled by excluding those values from the 
addresses 
!  Not a$ected by RELRO, ASLR or X^W 
!  Cons: 
!  Payloads can be large, depending on the availability of number 
!  Thus requires a big stage-0 
Number stitching

!  Search if there are numbers in memory not subject to ASLR: 
!  Check binaries with PIE enabled to see if anything comes up 
!  Probably wont come up with anything, but who knows? 
!  Search for gadgets in new versions of libc. Seems di"cult, but might 
yield a new approach

!  Get dynamic programming approach to work with large numbers: 
!  Challenging 
!  64 bit support. Easy, numbers are just bigger 
!  Introduce a mixed approach: 
!  String copying for bytes available 
!  Number stitching for others 
!  Maybe contribute it to ROPgadget (if they’re interested)
