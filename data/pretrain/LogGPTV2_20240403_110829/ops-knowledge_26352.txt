User: How to configure real-time monitoring systems such as Prometheus and Grafana?
Assistant: The following are the steps to configure the real-time monitoring system: 1. Install Prometheus: Install Prometheus on the target server and make sure it is running. You can verify that Prometheus is running by visiting its web UI. 2. Add the target in Prometheus: Add the target server in the Prometheus configuration and configure the location of the indicator. 3. Install and configure Exporter: Install and configure Exporter on the target server to integrate it with Prometheus. Exporter exposes server metrics to Prometheus. 4. Configure Grafana: Install and configure Grafana as a visualization tool, integrate it with Prometheus, and display the indicator data collected by Prometheus in Grafana. 5. Add Dashboard and Panel: Add Dashboard and Panel in Grafana to view visual charts of indicator data. You can customize Dashboard and Panel according to your needs. 6. Set alert rules: You can set alert rules based on the threshold of the indicator. When the threshold is reached or exceeded, Grafana will send an alert to notify you. The above are the basic steps to configure the real-time monitoring system. Note: This needs to be set up with security and performance in mind to ensure proper system operation.
