IV. THE ADDRESSED PROBLEMS
Consider an omniscient observer that is able to read, at any
time k, the state vector Sk, and knows for any point j ∈ S
the output of the error detection function ak(j). Based on this
knowledge, the goal of the omniscient observer is to infer the
set of devices that have been involved in massive and isolated
anomalies. The question that naturally crosses our mind is
whether these inferred sets exactly match both MRk and IRk.
We reformulate this question as the Anomaly Characterization
Problem (ACP). Speciﬁcally, for any k ≥ 1, for any system
states Sk−1 and Sk, for any Ak, and τ ∈ [[1, n − 1]], let
Mk and Ik be the two sets built by the omniscient observer

Theorem 3 (ACP Impossibility): ACP cannot be solved,
that is, the omniscient observer cannot always build Mk and

Proof: Proof by counter-example. We consider the sce-
nario depicted in Figure 3 which illustrates the variation of

k = {{1, 2, 3, 4},{5}}
and P 2
k = {{1},{2, 3, 4, 5}} be the two anomaly partitions

thus does not know whether MP 1
The same argument applies for IRk. Thus ACP cannot be
solved.

We have just shown that there exist conﬁgurations that do
not allow an omniscient observer to decide with certainty
which devices have been impacted by massive anomalies and
which ones have been impacted by isolated ones. We propose
to relax Problem 1 by partitioning Ak into three sets Mk,
Ik and Uk such that Mk and Ik contain all the devices for
which it is certain that these devices have been impacted by
respectively massive and isolated anomalies. We have
Ik = {(cid:2) ∈ Ak | ∀Pk,|Pk((cid:2))| ≤ τ}
Mk = {(cid:2) ∈ Ak | ∀Pk,|Pk((cid:2))| > τ}

Thus, whatever the anomaly partition Pk, Mk ⊂ MPk and
Ik ⊂ IPk. In particular Mk ⊂ MRk, Ik ⊂ IRk. On the other
hand, set Uk contains all the other devices j ∈ Ak for which
an omniscient observer cannot decide with certainty whether
j belongs to a massive anomaly or an isolated one. Formally,

Corollary 4: For any time k ≥ 1,
Uk = ∅ =⇒ ACP can be solved.
Proof: Suppose that Uk = ∅. By Deﬁnition 8, it means
that for any j in [[1, n]], either j belongs to Mk or j belongs
to Ik. Let us suppose that j belongs to Mk. The same
argument applies if j belongs to Ik. By Relation 2, j ∈
Mk ⇔ ∀Pk,|Pk(j)| > τ. In particular, ∀Pk, MPk
= MRk.
Any execution of Algorithm 1 allows us to build an anomaly
partition Pk, and thus MPk.
We now formulate a relaxed version of ACP. Speciﬁcally,
for any k ≥ 1, for any system states Sk−1 and Sk, for any
Ak, and τ ∈ [[1, n− 1]], let Mk, Ik and Uk be respectively the
set of devices involved in massive and isolated anomalies and
those being in an unresolved conﬁguration.
Problem 2 (Relaxed ACP): Is the omniscient observer al-
ways capable of building Mk, Ik and Uk such that
Mk ⊆ MRk and Ik ⊆ IRk and Mk ∪ Ik ∪ Uk = Ak
without knowing Rk?
Section V presents necessary and sufﬁcient conditions for any
device i ∈ Ak to belong to one of these three sets.

V. LOCALLY DECIDING WHETHER ONE BELONGS TO
In this section, we show how each device j ∈ Ak, k ≥ 1,
decides whether it belongs to Mk, Ik or Uk. A naive approach
consisting in generating all admissible anomaly partitions and
then in deciding for each device whether it belongs to Mk,
Ik, or Uk is clearly impractical. Indeed, the number of these
partitions is proportional to the Bell numbers, which is itself
(cid:5)
a sum of Stirling numbers of the second kind that is equal to
S(n, t) = 1
jn, where n is the number of
t!
devices and t the number of sets of the partition. Therefore,
S(n, t) grows exponentially with n. We propose to solve
the relaxed ACP through a cheaper and local computation
which relies uniquely on the knowledge of all the maximal
r-consistent motions j is involved in. Theorem 5 provides a
necessary and sufﬁcient condition (NSC) for j ∈ Ak to belong
to Ik. Theorems 6 and 7 give respectively a sufﬁcient condition
and a NSC for j ∈ Ak to belong to Mk. Finally, Corollary 8
exhibits a NSC for j ∈ Ak to belong to Uk.
A. A Necessary and Sufﬁcient Condition to Belong to Ik
We introduce the following two families W k(j) and Wk(j)
representing the family of all τ-dense motions (resp. maximal
τ-dense motions) j belongs to. We have
Mk(j) = {B ⊆ Ak | j ∈ B and B has a r-consistent motion}
W k(j) = {B ∈ Mk(j) | B has a maximal τ-dense motion}
Wk(j) = {B ∈ Mk(j) | B has a τ-dense motion} .
Theorem 5: For any k ≥ 1, and for any j ∈ Ak, we have
W k(j) = ∅ ⇐⇒ j ∈ Ik.

Proof: (⇒) Let j ∈ Ak. By assumption of the theorem,
W k(j) = ∅. Now, for any subset B ⊆ [[1, n]] having an r-
consistent motion there exists a subset B(cid:2) ⊆ [[1, n]] such that
B ⊆ B(cid:2) and B(cid:2) is maximal (See Deﬁnition 3 and Remark 1).
Thus, W k(j) = ∅ ⇒ Wk(j) = ∅. Therefore, by Deﬁnition 4,
j solely belongs to τ-sparse motions, and by Deﬁnition 5, for
any anomaly partition Pk, we have |Pk(j)| ≤ τ. Therefore, by
Deﬁnition 7, j can only be impacted by an isolated anomaly
in the time interval [k − 1, k] , thus j ∈ Ik.
(⇐) We prove that W k(j) (cid:10)= ∅ =⇒ j (cid:10)∈ Ik. Suppose that
W k(j) (cid:10)= ∅. Thus, j ∈ Ak and Wk(j) (cid:10)= ∅. Let subset B
be such that B ∈ W k(j). We run Algorithm 1 by initially
selecting j and B such that j ∈ B and B has a maximal r-
consistent motion. By Lemma 2, Algorithm 1 builds a valid
anomaly partition Pk, such that B is an element of Pk. We
have, Pk(j) = B. By construction of the proof, B ∈ W k(j),
thus |B| > τ. We have exhibited an anomaly partition for
which Pk(j) > τ. By Relation (2), j /∈ Ik, which completes
the proof.
In the following we give a necessary and sufﬁcient condition
for device j to belong to Mk (Theorem 7). Before that, we
provide a sufﬁcient condition for j to belong to Mk. The
rationale of this weaker condition (Theorem 6) is that, from a
computation point of view, it is more efﬁcient than the NSC
one and meanwhile, misses to detect that j ∈ Mk in a very
small number of scenario (simulations show that in average
less than 0.4% of the scenario are not covered by Theorem 6).
B. A Sufﬁcient Condition to Belong to Mk
We have just shown that if there are not enough devices
in the vicinity of j that belong to dense motions, then j has
necessarily been impacted by an isolated anomaly. Suppose
now that W k(j) (cid:10)= ∅, that is j belongs to a family of τ-dense
motions, and denote by Dk(j) the set of all these devices that
belong to W k(j). We have
Dk(j) =
(cid:6)
B.
B∈W k(j)
We split set Dk(j) into two subsets Jk(j) and Lk(j), such
that the former one contains all the devices for which all their
maximal τ-dense motions also contain j, while the latter one
contains all the devices that have at least one maximal τ-dense
motion that does not contain j. Notice that we have j ∈ Jk(j)
and j (cid:10)∈ Lk(j). Formally,
Jk(j) = {(cid:2) ∈ Dk(j) | ∀B ∈ W k((cid:2)), j ∈ B},
Lk(j) = {(cid:2) ∈ Dk(j) | ∃B ∈ W k((cid:2)), j /∈ B}.
Figure 4 illustrates for device 4 ∈ S the decomposition of
its neighbourhood Dk(4) into Jk(4) and Lk(4) for different
conﬁgurations. We assume that ∀i ∈ S, i ∈ Ak and τ = 2.
In Figure 4(a), S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. In this conﬁguration, we
have W k(4) = {{1, 2, 3, 4},{2, 4, 5}} and thus Dk(4) =
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. By deﬁnition, device 4 ∈ Jk(4). Devices 1 and
3 have a single maximal τ-dense motion C1 = {1, 2, 3, 4}, and
C1 contains 4. Thus 1, 3 ∈ Jk(4). In the same way, device 5
747474
has also a single maximal τ-dense motion C2 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5},
C2 contains 4. Thus 5 ∈ Jk(4). Finally, by applying the
same argument for device 2, we get 2 ∈ Jk(4). Putting
altogether, we have Jk(4) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and Lk(4) = ∅.
In Figure 4(b), S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}. Device 5 belongs to
both C2 = {2, 4, 5} and C3 = {5, 6, 7}, while device 4 does
not belong to C3. Thus Jk(4) = {1, 2, 3, 4}, Lk(4) = {5}.
