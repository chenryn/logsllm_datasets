Certainly! Here is a more polished and professional version of your text:

I have a web server running Django, which is hosted on an Apache server. I would like to configure Google App Engine (GAE) as the email server for this setup. Specifically, my web server should be able to use GAE when sending emails via the `EmailMessage` or `sendmail` infrastructure provided by the Google Mail API.

I understand that the Remote API can be used to access the Google App Engine server from my main web server. However, I have been unable to access the Mail APIs supported by GAE using this method.

Is the Remote API designed exclusively for Datastore operations? If so, does this mean that only database reads can be performed through it, and no other API calls are possible?

In the example code for the Remote API, an interactive console is provided, allowing access to any of the modules in the application. From what I can see, there is no explicit requirement that these operations be limited to Datastore operations.

This version is clearer, more concise, and maintains a professional tone.
