User: I have a web server with Django, hosted with Apache server. I would like to configure Google App Engine for the email server. My web server should be able to use Google App Engine, when it makes any email send using EmailMessage or sendmail infrastructure of Google Mail API. 
I learnt that by using Remote API, I can access Google App Engine server from my main web server. However, I could not access the Mail APIs supported by Google App Engine. 
Is the Remote API strictly for Datastore? If so, can only the DB read from it and no other API calls can?
Assistant: The example code for the remote APi gives you an interactive console from which you can access any of the modules in your application. I see no requirement that they be only datastore operations.
