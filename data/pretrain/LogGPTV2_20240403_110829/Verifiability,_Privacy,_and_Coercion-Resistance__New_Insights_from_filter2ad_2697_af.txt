E. Relationship between Privacy and Coercion-resistance
As already mentioned in the introduction, one would expect
that privacy and coercion-resistance are closely connected: If
a protocol provides a poor level of privacy, i.e., an observer
has a good chance of distinguishing whether an honest voter
(cid:2), then this should give the coercer
voted for candidate j or j
leverage to distinguish whether the coerced voter followed
the coercer’s instructions or not. Indeed some works suggest
a close connection between coercion-resistance and privacy,
most notable the already mentioned work by Moran and Naor
[21] and work in an abstract, Dolev-Yao style approach [10],
which, however, puts strong restrictions on the coercer and
counter-strategies. The deﬁnitions used in these works yield
yes/no-answers, rather than measuring the level of coercion-
resistance and privacy.
Our case study of ThreeBallot and VAV demonstrates that
the connection between privacy and coercion-resistance, in
particular when it comes to measuring the level of privacy and
coercion-resistance, is more subtle than what can be gathered
from existing work.
One observation that comes out of our case study is that
improving the level of privacy of a protocol in a natural way
(e.g., by changing the way honest voters ﬁll out ballots) can
lead to a worse level of coercion-resistance. This is the case
when going from the original variant of ThreeBallot to the
“privacy enhanced” variant by de Marneffe et al., as can be
seen from the results in Sections VI-C and VI-D (compare
the levels of privacy of the systems So+
TB, given
in Figure 3, with those for coercion-resistance of the same
systems in Figure 4). Clearly, in general, one does not expect
privacy to imply coercion-resistance. One might, however, ex-
pect that improving privacy also improves coercion-resistance.
In this sense, the illustrated effect is surprising. At the end of
this section, we propose another (though artiﬁcial) variant of
ThreeBallot which better explains and ampliﬁes the described
effect.
TB and Sp+
Another ﬁnding that comes out of our case study, which
maybe more unexpected, is that the level of privacy of a pro-
tocol can be much lower than its level of coercion-resistance.
This is so for the original variant of ThreeBallot and the
simple variant of VAV, as can be seen from the results in
Sections VI-C and VI-D (compare the level of privacy of So+
TB,
given in Figure 3, with the level of coercion resistance of this
system, given in Figure 4; similarly for the system Ss+
VAV). The
reason behind this phenomenon is basically that the counter-
strategy hides the behavior of the coerced voter, including her
vote, better than the honest voting program hides the vote.
Conversely, one could say that the honest voting program is
“suboptimal” in hiding the way the voter voted. In the original
variant of ThreeBallot and the simple variant of VAV, a receipt
an honest voter obtains indeed discloses more information
than necessary. The following simple, but unlike ThreeBallot
and VAV, artiﬁcial example, carries this effect to extremes:
Consider the ideal voting protocol which collects all votes and
publishes the correct result. Now imagine a voting protocol in
550
which voters use the ideal voting protocol to cast their vote,
but where half of the voters publish how they voted (e.g.,
based on a coin ﬂip). Clearly, the level of privacy this protocol
provides is very low, namely δ ≥ 1
2. However, a coerced voter
can be more clever and simply lie about how she voted. This
protocol indeed provides a high level of coercion-resistance,
namely δ ≈ δ i
(n/2,k,(cid:3)p) (see Section VI-B). Below we also
provide a slightly more subtle example based on ThreeBallot.
In case the counter-strategy does not “outperform” the hon-
est voting program (or conversely, the honest voting program
does not leak more information than the counter-strategy), one
would expect that if a voting system provides a certain level
of coercion-resistance, then it provides at least the same level
of privacy. We now show that this is indeed true.

For this purpose, let P
to outperform the honest voting program.
We ﬁrst have to deﬁne what it means for the counter-strategy
∗ = P(AH ,q,VH ,k,(cid:3)p) be a protocol
instantiation, with sets V and C of processes as in Deﬁnition 3.
As usual, with ˆπv( j) we denote the honest voting program
voting for candidate j and with γi we denote the goal which
contains all runs in which the coerced voter voted for candidate
i (or the weaker goal, where this is required, only if the voter
is instructed by the coercer to vote for some candidate). Let
˜vi be a counter-strategy that tries to achieve this goal. Let
π j
c be a process of the coercer which only connects to dum,
but does not use any other part of the interface the coercer
can connect to, and which simply simulates the program of
an honest voter voting for candidate j. Clearly, the systems
c (cid:5) dum) and ˆπv( j) are identical from the point of view of
(π j
an external observer.
Now, informally speaking, for ˜vi to not outperform ˆπv(i) we
require that from the point of view of an external observer,
˜vi, if instructed to vote for some candidate j by following the
honest program, behaves like ˆπv(i). Recall that, the program πo
of an external observer may output 0 or 1 on some designated
channel and may use the same communication interface as the
coercer, except for connecting to dum, i.e., there is no direct
communication between an external observer and the coerced
voter. Now, formally we say that ˜vi does not outperform ˆπv(i),
if for all programs πo of the external observer we have that
c (cid:5) ˜vi (cid:5) e)((cid:2)) (cid:9)→ 1]− Pr[(πo (cid:5) ˆπv(i) (cid:5) e)((cid:2)) (cid:9)→ 1]
Pr[(πo (cid:5) π j
is negligible as a function in the security parameter 1(cid:2).

Now, we can state that, under the assumption that

then it also achieves δ -privacy. In the following theorem,

(cid:2) ∈ {1, . . . ,k} and let πo be a
program of the observer, in the sense of Section VI-A. We
deﬁne πc = (πo (cid:5) π j
c ) to be a coercer program. Recall from
Section VI-B that the communication interface of a coercer is
that of an observer, except that a coercer can also communicate
with the coerced voter. Therefore, πc indeed is a coercer

we know that Pr[T (cid:9)→ 1] − Pr[ ˜T (cid:9)→ 1]
is δ -bounded for
T = (πc (cid:5) dum (cid:5) e)((cid:2)) and ˜T = (πc (cid:5) ˜v j(cid:2) (cid:5) e)((cid:2)).
c , we know that Pr[T (cid:9)→ 1] =
Now, by the deﬁnition of π j
(cid:2) = (πo (cid:5) ˆπv( j) (cid:5) e)((cid:2)). Moreover, because ˜v j(cid:2)
(cid:2) (cid:9)→
(cid:2)) (cid:5) e)((cid:2)). It follows that
˜T
(cid:2) (cid:9)→ 1] is δ -bounded, which proves that P

It turns out that for many voting protocol which have been
analyzed with respect
the (optimal)
counter-strategies indeed do not outperform the honest voting
program of the respective protocol. In particular, it is not
hard to check that at least the following protocols satisfy the
condition in Theorem 6: the Bingo voting system [3] (see
[18]), Scantegrity II [5] (see [17]), the JCJ voting protocol
[13] and the Civitas voting system [7] (see also [16]). Also the
“privacy enhanced” variants of ThreeBallot and VAV satisfy
the condition (but clearly not the other variants of ThreeBallot
and VAV we considered, since, as mentioned, for these variants
the level of coercion-resistance is higher—δ is smaller—than
the level of privacy.)
to coercion-resistance,
For such protocols, once δ -coercion-resistance is proven,
by Theorem 6 we obtain δ -privacy for free. In case the level
of coercion-resistance corresponds to the ideal one—as, e.g.,
proven for the Bingo voting system and Scantegrity II in [18]
and [17]—, by Theorems 2 and 3, the level of privacy is ideal
as well. However, in general, the actual level of privacy might
be better than what can be concluded from the theorem, with
the “privacy enhanced” variants of ThreeBallot and VAV being
examples.
