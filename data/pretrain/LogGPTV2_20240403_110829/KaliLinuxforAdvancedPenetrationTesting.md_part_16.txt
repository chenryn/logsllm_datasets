Highlight the identified systems that you wish to target (for example, all hosts located
on the same segment of a switched LAN) and select the Add to Target 1 tab.
When this is done, select the Plugins tab, which will provide you with a list of the
ettercap plugins that are available for use. Select the ec_dns_spoof.so plugin, as
shown in the following screenshot:
To launch the attack, select the Mitm tab, and choose Arp poisoning from the
pull-down menu, as shown in the following screenshot. Ettercap will poison the
Address Resolution Protocol table or cache, on the selected systems.
[ 196 ]
Chapter 7
When ARP poisoning is selected, you will be offered optional parameters. Select the
parameter to sniff remote connections. Then, go to the Start tab, and select to start
unified sniffing.
When a user on any of the targeted systems attempts to go to Facebook, their cache
table will not provide them with the location on the Internet. Ettercap will divert
their lookups to the URL that you supplied in the configuration file, and the users
will instead be directed to the hostile web page prepared by the attacker, and will be
subject to an attack such as credential harvesting.
At all times, the persons being attacked will see the apparently correct URL in their
browser window.
DNS redirection can be used to facilitate all attacks that rely on the user clicking on a
URL link to initiate the attack, and this works on both wired and wireless networks.
Physical access and hostile devices
Kali and SEToolkit also facilitate attacks where the intruder has direct physical
access to systems and the network. This can be a risky attack, as the intruder may
be spotted by an observant human, or caught on a surveillance device. However,
the reward can be significant, because the intruder can compromise specific systems
that have valuable data.
Physical access is usually a direct result of social engineering, especially when
impersonation is used. Common impersonations include the following:
• A person who claims to be from the help desk or IT support, and just needs
to quickly interrupt the victim by installing a system upgrade.
• A vendor who drops by to talk to a client, and then excuses himself to talk
to someone else or visit a restroom.
• A delivery person dropping off a package. Attackers can opt to buy a
delivery uniform online; however, since most people assume that anyone
who is dressed all in brown and pushing a handcart filled with boxes is a
UPS delivery person, uniforms are rarely a necessity for social engineering!
• Tradespersons wearing work clothes, carrying a "work order" that they
have printed out, are usually allowed access to wiring closets and other
areas, especially when they claim to be present at the request of the
building manager.
[ 197 ]
Physical Attacks and Social Engineering
• Dress in an expensive suit, carry a clipboard, and walk fast—employees
will assume that you're an unknown manager. When conducting this type
of penetration, we usually inform people that we are auditors, and our
inspections are rarely questioned.
The goal of hostile physical access is to rapidly compromise selected systems; this is
usually accomplished by installing a backdoor or similar device on the target.
One of the classic attacks is to place a CD-ROM, DVD, or USB key in a system and let
the system install it using the autoplay option; however, many organizations disable
autoplay across the network.
Attackers can also create "poisoned bait" traps—mobile devices that contain files
with names that invite a person to click the file and examine its contents. Some of the
examples include the following:
• USB keys with labels such as Employee Salaries or Medical Insurance
Updates.
• Metasploit allows an attacker to bind a payload, such as a reverse shell, to an
executable such as a screensaver. The attacker can create a screensaver using
publicly available corporate images, and mail CDs to employees with the
new endorsed screensaver. When the user installs the program, the backdoor is
also installed, and it connects to the attacker.
• If you know that employees have attended a recent conference, attackers
can impersonate a vendor who was present and send the target a letter
insinuating that it is a follow-up from the vendor show. A typical message
will be, "If you missed our product demonstration and one-year free trial,
please review the slide show on the attached USB key by clicking start.exe".
One interesting variant is the SanDisk U3 USB key, or Smart Drive. The U3 keys
were preinstalled with launchpad software that automatically allowed the keys to
write files or registry information directly to the host computer when inserted to
assist in the repaid launching of approved programs. The u3-pwn tool (Kali
Linux | Maintaining Access | OS Backdoors | u3-pwn) removes the original
ISO file from the Sandisk U3 and replaces it with a hostile Metasploit payload,
which is then encoded to avoid detection on the target system.
Unfortunately, support for these USB devices is lessening, and they remain
vulnerable to the same degree of detection as other Metasploit payloads.
[ 198 ]
Chapter 7
An emerging option is the use of Teensy—a small integrated circuit device that
registers as a USB keyboard when inserted into a Windows-based system. This
allows it to bypass systems that disable autorun or use client-side anti-virus software.
A Teensy can be purchased online from Amazon for approximately $20 to $25.
The setoolkit generates the code required by a Teensy to turn it into an attack
vector, as shown in the following screenshot:
A Teensy configured as a hostile agent is quite powerful; during penetration testing
of corporate clients, our testers have demonstrated a hundred percent chance of
being able to infect at least one system on each network being tested!
Unfortunately, these devices suffer a significant limitation—they can do only what
they are programmed to do, and the attacker or penetration tester has limited ability
to capitalize on any discoveries that are made post compromise.
To remedy this short-fall, attackers are now using microcomputers, such as the
Raspberry Pi, as the attack vector.
[ 199 ]
Physical Attacks and Social Engineering
Raspberry Pi attack vectors
The Raspberry Pi is a microcomputer—it measures approximately 8.5 cm X 5.5 cm
in size, but manages to pack 512 MB RAM, two USB ports, and an Ethernet port
supported by a Broadcom chip using an ARM processor running at 700 MHz
(which can be overclocked to 1 GHz). It doesn't include a hard drive, but uses an
SD card for data storage. As shown in the following image, the Raspberry Pi is
approximately two-third the length of a pen; it is easy to hide on a network (behind
workstations or servers, placed inside of server cabinets, or hidden beneath floor
panels in the data center).
To configure Raspberry Pi as an attack vector, the following items are required:
• Raspberry Pi Model B, or newer Version
• An HDMI cable
• A micro USB cable and charging block
• An Ethernet cable or mini-wireless adaptor
• A SD card, Class 10, of at least 8 GB
Together, all supplies are typically available online for a total of less than $100.
To configure Raspberry, download the latest version of Kali Linux ARM edition,
and extract it from the source archive. If you are configuring from a Windows-based
desktop, then download and extract Win32DiskImager (http://sourceforge.net/
projects/win32diskimager/).
[ 200 ]
Chapter 7
Using a card reader, connect the SD card to the Windows-based computer and open
the Win32DiskImager. Select the ARM version of Kali, kali-custom-rpi.img,
which was downloaded and previously extracted, and write it to the SD card.
This will take some time.
Separate instructions for flashing the SD card from Mac or Linux systems are
available on the Kali website.
Insert the newly flashed SD card into the Raspberry Pi and connect the Ethernet
cable or wireless adapter to the Windows workstation, the HDMI cable to a monitor,
and the Micro USB power cable to a power supply. Once supplied with power, it will
boot directly into Kali Linux. The Raspberry relies on external power, and there is no
separate on/off switch; however, Kali can still be shut down from the command line.
Once Kali is installed, ensure that it is up to date using the apt-get command.
Make sure the SSH host keys are changed as soon as possible, as all Raspberry Pi
images have the same keys. Use the following command:
root@kali:~rm /etc/ssh/ssh_host_*
root@kali:~dpkg-reconfigure openssh-server
root@kali:~ service ssh restart
At the same time, make sure the default username and password are changed.
The next step is to configure Raspberry to connect back to the attacker's computer
(using a static IP address or a dynamic DNS addressing service) at a regular
interval using cron.
An attacker must then physically access the target's premises and connect
Raspberry to the network. The majority of networks automatically assigns
devices a DHCP address and has limited controls against this type of attack.
Once Raspberry connects back to the attacker's IP address, the attacker can run
reconnaissance and exploit applications against the victim's internal network
from a remote location using SSH to issue commands.
If a wireless adapter is connected, such as EW-7811Un, the 150 Mbps wireless
802.11b/g/nNano USB adaptor, the attacker can connect wirelessly, or use the
Pi to launch wireless attacks (Chapter 8, Exploiting Wireless Communications).

Physical Attacks and Social Engineering
Summary
Social engineering is a methodology of hacking the human—taking advantage
of a person's innate trust and helpfulness to attack a network and its devices.
In this chapter, we examined how social engineering can be used to facilitate
attacks designed to harvest network credentials, activate malicious software,
or assist in launching further attacks. Most of the attacks rely on the Social
Engineering Toolkit; however, Kali has several other applications that can be
improved using a social engineering methodology. We also examined how
physical access, usually in conjunction with social engineering, can be used
to place hostile devices on a target network.
In the next chapter, we will examine how to conduct reconnaissance against
wireless networks, and attack open networks as well as networks that are
protected with encryption schemes based on WEP, WPA, and WPA2. We
will also examine general weaknesses in wireless protocols that render them
vulnerable to the denial of service attacks, as well as impersonation attacks.
[ 202 ]
Exploiting Wireless
Communications
With the dominance of mobile devices and the need to provide instant network
connectivity, wireless networks have become the ubiquitous access point to the
Internet. Unfortunately, the convenience of wireless access is accompanied with
an increase in effective attacks that result in theft of access and data as well as the
denial of service of network resources. Kali provides several tools to configure and
launch these wireless attacks, allowing organizations to improve security.
In this chapter, we will examine several housekeeping tasks and wireless
attacks, including:
• Configuring Kali for wireless attacks
• Wireless reconnaissance
• Bypassing MAC address authentication
• Compromising WEP encryption
• Attacking WPA and WPA2
• Wireless attacks and social engineering—cloning an access point
• Intercepting communications—man-in-the-middle wireless attacks
• Man-in-the-middle wireless attacks
• Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks against wireless communications
Exploiting Wireless Communications
Configuring Kali for wireless attacks
Kali Linux was released with several tools to facilitate the testing of wireless
networks; however, these attacks require extensive configuration to be fully
effective. In addition, testers should acquire a strong background in wireless
networking before they implement attacks or audit a wireless network.
The most important tool in wireless security testing is the wireless adaptor,
which connects to the wireless access point. It must support the tools that are used,
especially the aircrack-ng suite of tools; in particular, the card's chipset and drivers
must possess the ability to inject wireless packets into a communication stream. This
is a requirement for attacks that require specific packet types to be injected into the
traffic stream between the target and the victim. The injected packets can cause a
denial of service, allowing an attacker to capture handshake data needed to crack
encryption keys or support other wireless attacks.
The aircrack-ng site (www.aircrack-ng.org) contains a list of known compatible
wireless adaptors.
The most reliable adapters that can be used with Kali are the ALFA NETWORK
cards, especially the AWUS036NH adaptors, which support wireless 802.11 b, g,
and n protocols. The Alfa cards are readily available online and will support all
the tests and attacks delivered using Kali.
Wireless reconnaissance
The first step to conduct a wireless attack is to conduct reconnaissance—this
identifies the exact target access point and highlights the other wireless networks
that could impact testing.
If you are using a USB-connected wireless card to connect to a Kali virtual machine,
make sure that the USB connection has been disconnected from the host operating
system and is attached to the VM by clicking on the USB connection icon , which is
indicated by an arrow in the following screenshot:
[ 204 ]
Chapter 8
Next, determine which wireless interfaces are available by running iwconfig from
the command line, as shown in the following screenshot:
For certain attacks, you may wish to increase the power output of the adapter. This
is especially useful if you are colocated with a legitimate wireless access point, and
you want the targets to connect to a false access point under your control rather than
the legitimate access point. These false, or rogue, access points allow an attacker to
intercept data and to view or alter it as needed to support an attack. Attackers will
frequently copy or clone a legitimate wireless site and then increase its transmission
power compared to the legitimate site as a means of attracting victims. To increase
power, the following command is used:
kali@linux:~# iwconfig wlan0 txpower 30
Many attacks will be conducted using aircrack-ng and its related tools. To start, we
need to be able to intercept or monitor wireless transmissions; therefore, we need to
set the Kali communication interface with wireless capabilities to monitor mode using
the airmon-ng command:
kali@linux:~# airmon-ng start wlan0
The execution of the previous command is shown in the following screenshot:
[ 205 ]
Exploiting Wireless Communications
Note that the description that is returned indicates that there are some processes that
could cause trouble. The most effective way to deal with these processes is to use a
comprehensive kill command as follows:
root@kali:~# airmon-ng check kill
To view the local wireless environment, use the following command:
root@kali:~# airodump-ng mon0
The previous command lists all the identified networks that can be found within the
range of the wireless adaptor at that particular point of time. It provides the BSSID of
the wireless nodes on the network as identified by the MAC addresses, an indication
of the relative output power, information on data packets sent, bandwidth information
including the channel used, and data, information on the encryption used, and the
ESSID which provides the name of the wireless network. This information is shown
in the following screenshot; non-essential ESSIDs have been blurred out:
The airodump command cycles through the available wireless channels and
identifies the following:
• The Basic Service Set Identifier (BSSID), which is the unique MAC address
that identifies a wireless access point or router.
[ 206 ]
Chapter 8
• The PWR, or power, of each network. Although airodump-ng incorrectly
shows power as being negative, this is a reporting artefact. To obtain the
proper positive values, access a terminal and run airdriver-ng unload
36 and then run airdriver-ng load 35.
• CH shows the channel that is being used to broadcast.
• ENC shows the encryption in use—it is OPN, or open, for no encryption being
used, or WEP or WPA/WPA2 if encryption is being used. CIPHER and AUTH
provide additional encryption information.
• The Extended Service Set Identifier (ESSID) is the common name of the
wireless network that is made up of the access points that share the same
SSID or name.
In the lower section of the terminal window, you will see the stations attempting to
connect, or that are connected to the wireless network.
Before we can interact with any of these (potential) target networks, we have to
confirm that our wireless adapter is capable of packet injection. To do this, run the
following command from a terminal shell prompt:
root@kali:~# aireplay-ng -9 mon0
The execution of the previous command is shown in the following screenshot.
Here -9 indicates an injection test.
Kismet
One of the most important tools for wireless reconnaissance is Kismet, an 802.11
wireless detector, sniffer, and intrusion detection system.
Kismet can be used to gather the following information:
• Name of the wireless network, ESSID
• Channel of the wireless network
[ 207 ]
Exploiting Wireless Communications
• The MAC address of the access point, BSSID
• The MAC address of the wireless clients
It can also be used to sniff data from 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, and 802.11n wireless
traffic. Kismet also supports plugins that allow it to sniff other wireless protocols.
To launch Kismet, enter kismet from a command prompt in a terminal window.
When Kismet is launched, you will be faced with a series of questions that will allow
you to configure it during the start up process. Respond with Yes to Can you see
colors, accept Kismet is running as root, and select Yes to Start Kismet Server. In
the Kismet start up options, uncheck Show Console as it will obscure the screen.
Allow Kismet to start.
You will be prompted to add a capture interface; usually, wlan0 will be selected.
Kismet will then start sniffing packets and collecting information about all the
wireless systems located in the immediate physical neighborhood.
[ 208 ]
Chapter 8
Selecting a network by double-clicking on it will bring you to a network view that
provides additional information on the wireless network.
You can also drill down to identify specific clients that connect to the various
wireless networks.
Use Kismet as an initial reconnaissance tool to launch some specific attacks (such
as sniffing-transmitted data) or to identify networks. Because it passively collects
connectivity data, it is an excellent tool for identifying networks that are hidden,
especially when the SSID is not being publicly transmitted.
Bypassing a Hidden Service Set Identifier
ESSID is the sequence of characters that uniquely identify a wireless local area
network. Hiding the ESSID is a poor method of attempting to achieve security
through obscurity; unfortunately, the ESSID can be obtained by:
• Sniffing the wireless environment and waiting for a client to associate to a
network and then capturing that association
• Actively deauthenticating a client to force the client to associate and then
capturing that association
The aircrack tools are particularly well suited to capture the data needed to unhide
a hidden ESSID, as shown in the following steps:
1. At the command prompt, confirm that wireless is enabled on the attacking
system by entering the following command:
root@kali:~# airmon-ng
2. Next, use the following ifconfig command to review the available
interfaces and to determine the exact name used by your wireless system:
root@kali:~# ifconfig
3. Enable your wireless interface by entering the following (you may need to
replace wlan0 with an available wireless interface that was identified in the
previous step):
root@kali:~# airmon-ng start wlan0
