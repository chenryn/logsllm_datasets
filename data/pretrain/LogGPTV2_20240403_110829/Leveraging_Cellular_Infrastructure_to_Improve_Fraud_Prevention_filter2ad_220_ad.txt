when they download FrauVent. Moreover, a symmetric key can
be generated and established between the two using an initial
pairing/registration process.
Key to the widespread use of an application such as
FrauVent is user acceptance. In particular, a wide range of
users must feel comfortable interacting with their bank through
the interfaces we are providing. From a usability standpoint,
we argue that the work in this paper represents a signiﬁcant
step forward over prior works as we take advantage of the
increasingly rich interfaces available to mobile phones. How-
ever, a number of issues remain. For instance, we have yet to
determine the “ideal” range of the map presented to a user.
While the current interface allows users to zoom out if the
current view is too restrictive, we believe that automatically
displaying the right amount of geographic detail will enhance
acceptance. To meet this goal, we are currently discussing a
large scale user acceptance test with a major US ﬁnancial
institution using actual customers. We believe that such a study
requires its own research effort and therefore leave it to future
work.
Our protocol currently requires cellular providers to sign
approximations of user location. In particular, we aim to
provide banks with a third-party’s corroboration of location
information to prevent a number of attacks (e.g., GPS jam-
ming). We approximate these steps in our deployment using
the WhereAmI infrastruture. However, such localization by
the provider (and the subsequent signature) may be viewed
as too expensive. This step can be eliminated by a provider
at the potential risk that a client is unable to reliably detect
its location. We leave the determination of the risk of such
an attack to a provider considering cooperating with the
deployment of FrauVent.
There are a number of other issues that we have not
addressed. Malware targeting mobile devices is of growing
importance. In particular, devices that fail to provide even
the most basic security mechanisms (e.g., memory protection)
are at risk of being compromised. We argue that the use of
techniques such as the process isolation provided by Android’s
Dalvik virtual machine help reduce such threats. However,
solving the problem of mobile malware is explicitly beyond
the scope of this work.
Finally, we believe that this work makes an important step
towards making mobile phones into more generally applicable
authentication tokens. While we are by no means the ﬁrst to
suggest the use of this device, the vast majority of solutions
simply use the cellular infrastructure as a means of delivering
unauthenticated messages. Our scheme attempts to provide
strong guarantees and leverage some of the strengths of this
infrastructure - its ubiquity, processing ability and awareness
of location information, to provide a framework for more
secure interaction.
VIII. CONCLUSION
The cost of stolen ﬁnancial credentials is becoming in-
creasingly burdensome on both consumers and industries.

While a wide array of two-factor authentication systems have
been proposed to address many such issues, none have been
widely adopted in this space for a variety of reasons. In
this paper, we present FrauVent, an application designed to
take advantage of the emerging set of expressive interfaces
available to mobile phones to provide users with the context
necessary to approve or reject suspicious transactions. We
used a combination of protocol design, formal veriﬁcation
and a small scale deployment on phones running the Android
platform to demonstrate the potential of our approach. We
believe that
this initial framework provides an important
step towards effectively leveraging cellular infrastructure to
improve the physical security of sensitive information.
