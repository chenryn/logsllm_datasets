networks, location alone cannot provide a good prediction of
signal strength or throughput. As confirmed by our measurement
results, there are far more factors affecting 5G performance.
We therefore focus on 5G throughput measurement directly by
building a measurement platform (an app) that can run on 5G
mobile handsets (¬ß3.1). The ability of predicting 5G throughput
with a reasonable accuracy can help improve transport-layer
mechanisms [22‚Äì24, 42] needed to address new challenges posed
by 5G. It can also benefit many applications, e.g., adaptive video
bitrate streaming [27, 58, 62, 70]. For example, it is shown in [58]
that with a prediction error ‚â§ 20%, the QoE of adaptive video
streaming can be improved close to optimal (> 85)%. We believe that
such an ability is more critical to emerging 5G eMBB applications
that require ultra-high bandwidth. Conventional methods adopted
by applications for throughput estimation and prediction have
been mostly ‚Äúin situ‚Äù in that applications either use past data
transmissions or generate a few probes to estimate and predict
(immediate) future throughput [45]. Some of these approaches also
heavily rely on having access to PHY-layer information [20, 43, 54].
However, to address modern-day security concerns, mobile OS
developers have increasingly started to restrict third-party app
developers from having access to OS-level APIs which earlier
provided easy access to low-level PHY-layer information [54].
Going forward, we believe that conventional methods would be
inadequate for 5G applications to estimate throughput performance.
Moreover, in order to predict 5G throughput with a reasonable
accuracy, it is also important to capture and account for various
environment, contextual, and other exogenous factors. We show
that the carrier‚Äôs 5G coverage map (see Fig. 3a) as well as the 5G
coverage mapped by us (see Fig. 3b that shows the percentage
of 5G connectivity) are insufficient to understand 5G throughput.
We thus advocate building 5G throughput maps (e.g., see Fig. 3c)
based on user-led (collaborative) 5G throughput measurement data.
Such throughput maps not only show 5G coverage and depict
5G throughput variability over time and across different locales,
but more importantly, they also incorporate (mmWave-specific)
environmental and contextual factors (in the form of ML models)
to help apps better utilize 5G‚Äôs high-throughput.
‚Ä¢ Why ML Models for 5G Throughput Prediction? For a
long time, ML has been used for throughput prediction not only
in wireless networks but also in wired networks [32, 46]. However,
due to the vagary of wireless signals and the recent advancements
in ML, data-driven machine learning (ML) models have become
popular for 3G/4G cellular network management (see ¬ß7). Given the
diverse array of impact factors and their complex interplay, the need
for ML models for 5G networks is more acute. However, instead of
blindly applying machine learning to the problem of 5G throughput
prediction, we seek to answer a few basic questions: (i) Is mmWave
5G throughput predictable, and to what extent? (ii) What key
UE-side factors (or features) most affect 5G throughput? (iii) In
order to capture these key factors, what types of ML models are best
suited for 5G throughput prediction? In particular, can we develop
ML models that are explainable? To this end, we carefully design
our measurements under various settings (e.g., selecting indoor and
outdoor areas, considering both stationary and mobility scenarios
of various moving speeds), and conduct extensive and repeated
5G coverage provided by carrierAverage throughput5G service area# of samples with active 5G connectivity over total samples0 %100 %<60Mbps1000+MbpsIMC ‚Äô20, October 27‚Äì29, 2020, Virtual Event, USA

experiments for data collection, throughput characterization and
factor analysis (see ¬ß4). Based on these results, we motivate and
present our proposed ML models in ¬ß5.
2.3 Potential Use Cases
We conclude this section by illustrating some potential use cases
of Lumos5G framework when in action, and its proposed 5G
throughput maps and ML models.
3.1 Our Measurement Platform
Measurement App. At the time of this study, the state-of-the-art
Android OS (version 10) claims to provide access to 5G-NR related
APIs [2‚Äì4]. However, none of the 5G carriers provide any mean-
ingful responses to these APIs. With no mature tools available to
collect 5G information and absence of 5G datasets, we have devel-
oped our own suite of Android app and tools for 5G performance
monitoring and throughput measurement. We parse raw-string
representation of Android‚Äôs ServiceState & SignalStrength ob-
jects to get information about phone state, service state, and signal
strength. Our app logs information sampled every second such as
the UE‚Äôs geolocation, orientation (i.e., compass direction), tower (or
panel) ID, moving speed, active radio type (e.g., 5G-NR or LTE), etc.
Figure 5: {Panel, Positional, Moving} Angles.
Figure 4: Lumos5G in Action.
Consider four users Alice, Bob, Charlie, and Daisy are all stream-
ing high-resolution videos (see Fig. 4). Alice is taking a ride inside
a taxi, while Bob is walking on the pedestrian street in the same
direction as Alice‚Äôs ride. Charlie is walking on the other side, while
Daisy is walking inside the park. With Lumos5G, their UEs auto-
matically downloads 5G throughput maps with ML models based
on their geographic locations; the video streaming app interacts
(via appropriate APIs) with the ML models which take into account
the context and various factors such as location, moving speed & di-
rection, type of available service3 to predict 5G throughput (shown
as a conical heatmap). Accordingly, the app can make intelligent
decisions (e.g., bitrate adaptation) to improve user QoE.
For instance, user mobility has a significant impact on 5G per-
formance. Hence, Alice who is taking a taxi ride at a relatively high
speed should expect to experience degraded performance compared
to Bob who is walking along the same trajectory. Similarly, when
Charlie is about to walk across a handoff patch (as learned by the
model), there will be a momentary degradation in performance
which the app can anticipate and prepare for. Daisy who is walking
in the park does not have a clear line of sight to the 5G tower;
however due to the concrete high-rise buildings around her, signals
may reflect back, providing degraded 5G performance. Thus, 5G
carriers can incorporate Lumos5G and its ML models to supply
apps with throughput prediction by taking into account the key
factors based on the user context, and aid the apps (a la service
or content providers) in making intelligent decisions. UE can also
provide feedback information to help carriers in making resource
allocation and scheduling decisions based on application needs.
3 DATA COLLECTION & QUALITY
We focus on 5G throughput measurement with the goal of
identifying and characterizing the key UE-side factors impacting 5G
throughput performance. In the following, we list the challenges in
collecting 5G throughput data, present our measurement platform,
key considerations we make to ensure data quality remains high,
and summarize the details of our datasets.
3e.g., mmWave, mid-band or low-band 5G, LTE, LTE-A or LTE-CA
With the knowledge of the 5G panel4 location and orientation
(identified by manually surveying the area), we compute additional
fields of the UE with respect to each panel to study their impact
on 5G throughput. As depicted in Fig. 5, the UE-Panel distance
is shown with the red line between pixelized location of UE and
tower panel. The green arrow indicates the panel direction with
respect to (w.r.t.) the North pole. UE-Panel positional angle ùúÉùëù is
the angle of the UE w.r.t. panel irrespective of moving direction.
UE-Panel mobility angle ùúÉùëö is the angle between the line normal to
the front-face of the panel and the UE‚Äôs trajectory. Table 1 lists all
the fields that our app collects. They will be used in our subsequent
measurement analysis and features for ML.
Obtaining Throughput Ground Truth. To get the throughput
ground truth, our tool measures the bulk transfer throughput over
5G. We cross-compile iPerf 3.7 [8] and integrate it into our app
such that a UE is periodically downloading content from a backend
server. This enables us to not only collect vital statistics about the
network state, but also evaluate 5G throughput performance under
different settings such as mobility mode, geolocation, etc. To ensure
we fully saturate the available bandwidth provided by the 5G carrier,
we establish 8 parallel TCP connections with the backend server,
as the UE was not able to fully utilize 5G‚Äôs downlink bandwidth
using 1 TCP connection [47].
Prevent Internet being Bottleneck. With the ultra-high band-
width offered by mmWave 5G, the bottleneck of an end-to-end path
between a UE and the backend server (i.e., the content server) may
shift from the radio access network or carrier‚Äôs infrastructure to
the Internet. To avoid this and ensure more accurate 5G throughput
measurement results, we have conducted extensive measurements
using a variety of servers hosted by multiple public and private
cloud providers at diverse geographical locations. We observe that
factors such as server location and cloud service provider affect 5G
performance. Taking cues from our prior work [47], we conduct
several experiments (at least 5√ó 60-second runs) using servers from
4We observed each mmWave 5G tower deployment had one to three 5G panels or
transceivers (often installed on poles) facing different directions.

multiple cloud service providers (three public and one private). We
then choose servers using the following filtering criteria: (1) down-
loading from these servers yields the highest 5G throughput (sta-
tistically) compared to servers in other locations and/or providers;
and (2) downloading from these servers using other wired (non-
mobile) hosts yields at least 3 Gbps throughput, well beyond the
peak 5G throughput. Finally, to confirm the accuracy of our mea-
surements, we also use the commercial Ookla Speedtest [11] tool to
test the throughput and ensure that their results match ours, with
a difference less than 5%.
Ensuring High Data Quality. GPS coordinates, compass di-
rection, and moving speed reported by Android APIs are often
inaccurate enough especially when fine granularity matters. Hence,
direct usage of these values can be misleading. To ensure data
quality remains high, we: (1) repeatedly conduct multiple measure-
ments per trajectory on different dates and times of day to ensure
the collected data is statistically representative (see ¬ß3.2), (2) dis-
card data where the average GPS error (reported by the Android
Location API) is greater than 5 meters along the trajectory, (3) add
a ‚Äúbuffer period‚Äù at the beginning of each walk/drive test waiting
for the UE to perform GPS/compass calibration, and (4) reduce
the localization noise by discretizing raw GPS coordinates to the
nearest known (pre-calculated) pixelized coordinates. The pixel
coordinates are defined by Google Maps Javascript API [9] for each
zoom level a Google map is viewed at. This helps create a grid over
the geographic map. For instance, at zoom level 17, each pixel‚Äôs
spatial resolution ranges between 0.99 to 1.19 meters (‚àº1 meter for
this paper) [6, 12]. In our study, we use 17 as the zoom level as this
resolution provides a nice balance without being overly precise as
GPS coordinates are but at the same time represents a geographic
location with a reasonable spatial resolution. Pixelized coordinates
also help reduce the sparseness that exists in high resolution GPS-
based coordinates. In the rest of the paper, geolocation coordinates
refer to pixelized (X, Y) coordinates at zoom level 17.
