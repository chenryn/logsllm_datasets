of the need for further support. It should also be noted
that the policy intervention described in this paper gave
users a choice in balancing delayed expiration and cost
of managing a stronger password, rather than forcing the
6.1 Policy interventions
One take-away here is that conclusions about the impact
of an intervention should not be drawn based on immedi-
ate improvement or lack thereof. Other studies of the im-
pact of behaviour change caused by security policies – in
particular, lab studies – should measure interventions at
meaningful intervals over a suitably long period of time,
where arguably this would be a continuous activity.
When designing a new intervention, practitioners
should consider how to measure the effectiveness of a
change and the associated impact on users. After an in-
tervention is deployed it may beneﬁt from being moni-
tored and calibrated, towards reducing problems and re-
ward secure behaviour, where dynamic policy that reacts
to users is far from being a common capability.
We have found that users will generally change their
password in response to password expiry warnings and
reminders; warning users too early effectively reduces
the password lifetime. This potentially confuses the
boundaries and meaning behind what password expiry
is for, and what password expiry warnings are intended
to achieve. Similarly, some of the cost of password re-
sets can be avoided by allowing expired passwords to be
changed, rather than going through a reset procedure.
Considering our ﬁndings regarding password resets
and voluntary password changes, a reward of a longer
password lifetime is not the same as an optimal reward;
this opens up avenues of research to ﬁnd optimally se-
cure and workable defenses. In an ideal scenario we en-
vision a deployment of a policy linking password expira-
tion with password strength only if the weakest accept-
able password is below the 106 guesses threshold identi-
ﬁed by Florˆencio et al. [23]. Passwords would then ex-
pire in line with the expected online guessing resistance
of the password; if a password is stronger than the online
guessing threshold it should not unconditionally expire.
