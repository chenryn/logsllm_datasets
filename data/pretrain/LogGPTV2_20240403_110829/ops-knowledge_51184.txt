User: How to achieve high-availability architecture design, automatic load balancing and failover among multiple servers?
Assistant: To achieve high-availability architecture design, the following aspects need to be considered: 1. Server cluster Load balancing and failover among multiple servers requires the construction of a server cluster. Each server in the cluster can process requests independently, but they share load and data . When a server fails, other servers will take over the tasks and data to keep the system running normally. 2. Load balancing Load balancing is one of the key technologies to achieve high availability. It can distribute requests to each server in the cluster to achieve the purpose of load balancing. Common load balancing strategies include round robin, weight, IP hashing, etc. Generally, the persistence of the session should also be considered to ensure that the user's session between multiple servers will not be interrupted. 3. Failover In the cluster, when a server fails, it needs to respond in time to avoid data loss or service interruption. At this time, you can use hot backup, cold backup, or dual-system hot backup to perform failover. Hot standby means that the backup server has been started and can receive requests; cold standby means that the running state of the backup server is the backup state and needs to be manually started; dual-machine hot standby means that both the main and backup servers are in the running state. When the main server fails, the backup server takes over Serve. 4. When data backup and restoration fails, the data on the server may be severely damaged or lost. Therefore, data backup and recovery is also an important aspect to achieve high availability. Multi-level backup strategies can be adopted, including regular backup, incremental backup, differential backup, etc., to ensure that data can be restored in time. In short, to achieve high-availability architecture design, multiple aspects need to be considered comprehensively, and technical means such as load balancing, failover and data backup should be flexibly used to ensure the reliability and stability of the system.
