1. Enable configuration of the router (or switch) chassis properties:
[edit]
user@host# edit chassis
2. Enable configuration of a DPC (and its corresponding Packet Forwarding Engines) or an FPC (and its
installed PICs):
[edit chassis]
user@host# edit fpc slot-number
3. Bind a named instance of Layer 2 port mirroring (pm-instance-name) to the DPC or FPC:
[edit chassis fpc slot-number]
user@host# set port-mirror-instance pm-instance-name
4. (Optional) To bind a second named instance of Layer 2 port mirroring to the same DPC or FPC,
repeat the previous step (step 3) and specify a different named instance of Layer 2 port mirroring.
5. Verify the minimum configuration of the binding:
[edit chassis fpc slot-number port-mirror-instance pm-instance-name]
user@host# top
[edit]
user@host# show chassis
chassis {
fpc slot-number { # Bind two port mirroring named instances at the FPC level.
port-mirror-instance pm-instance-name-1;
port-mirror-instance pm-instance-name-2;
}
}
Binding Layer 2 Port Mirroring to Ports Grouped at the PIC Level
On an MX Series router and on an EX Series switch, you can bind a named instance of Layer 2 port
mirroring to the ports associated with a specific Packet Forwarding Engine (on a DPC) or to the ports
associated with a specific PIC (installed in an FPC). This is known as binding a named instance of Layer 2
port mirroring at the PIC level of the router (or switch) chassis. The port-mirroring properties specified in
the named instance are applied to all physical ports associated with the specified Packet Forwarding
Engine.
1138
NOTE: You can also bind a named instance of Layer 2 port mirroring to a specific DPC or FPC in
the router (or switch) chassis.
For any packet-type family supported by Layer 2 port mirroring:
• Port-mirroring properties bound to a specific Packet Forwarding Engine override any port-
mirroring properties configured at the DPC or FPC level.
• Port-mirroring properties bound to a specific DPC or FPC override any port-mirroring
properties configured at the global level.
You can apply up to two named instances of Layer 2 port-mirroring to the same group of ports within
the router (or switch) chassis. By applying two different port-mirroring instances to the same Packet
Forwarding Engine or PIC, you can bind two distinct Layer 2 port mirroring specifications to a single
group of ports.
For MX960 routers, there is a one-to-one mapping of Packet Forwarding Engines to Ethernet ports.
Therefore, on MX960 routers only, you can bind a named instance of Layer 2 port mirroring to a
specific port by binding the instance to the Packet Forwarding Engine associated with the port.
Before you begin, complete the following tasks:
• Define a named instance of Layer 2 port mirroring. See Defining a Named Instance of Layer 2 Port
Mirroring.
• Display information about the number and types of DPCs in the MX Series router or in the EX Series
switch, the number of Packet Forwarding Engines on each DPC, and the number and types of ports
per Packet Forwarding Engine.
To bind a named instance of Layer 2 port mirroring to a Packet Forwarding Engine:
1. Enable configuration of the router (or switch) chassis properties:
[edit]
user@host# edit chassis
2. Enable configuration of a Packet Forwarding Engine or PIC:
[edit chassis]
user@host# edit fpc slot-number
user@host# edit pic slot-number
1139
3. Bind a named instance of Layer 2 port mirroring (pm-instance-name) to the Packet Forwarding
Engine or PIC:
[edit chassis fpc slot-number pic slot-number]
user@host# set port-mirror-instance pm-instance-name
4. (Optional) To bind a second named instance of Layer 2 port mirroring to the same Packet Forwarding
Engine or PIC, repeat the previous step (step 3) and specify a different named instance of Layer 2
port mirroring.
5. Verify the minimum configuration of the binding:
[edit forwarding-options ... ]
user@host# top
[edit]
user@host# show chassis
chassis {
fpc slot-number {
... optional-binding-of-a-port-mirroring-instance-at-the-dpc-level ...
pic slot-number { # Bind two port-mirroring named instances at the PIC level.
port-mirror-instance pm-instance-name-1;
port-mirror-instance pm-instance-name-2;
}
}
}
Examples: Layer 2 Port Mirroring at Multiple Levels of the Chassis
IN THIS SECTION
Layer 2 Port Mirroring at the FPC Level | 1140
Layer 2 Port Mirroring at the PIC Level | 1140
Layer 2 Port Mirroring at the FPC and PIC Levels | 1141
On an MX Series router or on an EX Series switch, you can apply named instances of Layer 2 port
mirroring at the FPC or DPC level of the chassis or at the PIC level of the chassis. However, you can
configure (and implicitly apply) only one global instance of Layer 2 port mirroring to the entire chassis.
1140
Layer 2 Port Mirroring at the FPC Level
In this example configuration of an MX Series router or of an EX Series switch chassis, a named instance
of Layer 2 port mirroring (pm1) is bound to physical ports grouped at the FPC level:
[edit]
chassis {
fpc 2 {
port-mirror-instance pm1;
}
}
This is not a complete configuration. The physical interfaces associated with the FPC or DPC in slot 2
must be configured at the [edit interfaces] hierarchy level. The Layer 2 port mirroring named instance
pm1 must be configured at the [edit forwarding-options port-mirroring instance] hierarchy level.
Layer 2 Port Mirroring at the PIC Level
In this example configuration of an MX Series router or of an EX Series switch chassis, a named instance
of Layer 2 port mirroring (pm2) is bound to the physical ports grouped at the PIC level:
[edit]
chassis {
fpc 2 {
pic 0 {
port-mirror-instance pm2;
}
}
}
This is not a complete configuration. The physical interfaces associated with the FPC or DPC in slot 2
must be configured at the [edit interfaces] hierarchy level. The Layer 2 port mirroring named instance
pm2 must be configured at the [edit forwarding-options port-mirroring instance] hierarchy level.
1141
Layer 2 Port Mirroring at the FPC and PIC Levels
In this example configuration of an MX Series router chassis or an EX Series switch, one named instance
of Layer 2 port mirroring (pm1) is applied at the FPC level of the router (or switch) chassis. A second
named instance (pm2) is applied at the PIC level:
[edit]
chassis {
fpc 2 {
port-mirror-instance pm1;
pic 0 {
port-mirror-instance pm2;
}
}
}
This is not a complete configuration. Physical interfaces associated with the FPC or DPC in slot 2,
including physical interfaces associated with pic 0, must be configured at the [edit interfaces] hierarchy
level. The Layer 2 port mirroring named instances pm1 and pm2 must be configured at the [edit
forwarding-options port-mirroring instance] hierarchy level.
Configuring Layer 2 Port Mirroring Over GRE Interface
Port mirroring is the ability of a router to send a copy of a packet to an external host address or a packet
analyzer for analysis. One application for port mirroring sends a duplicate packet to a virtual tunnel. A
next-hop group can then be configured to forward copies of this duplicate packet to several interfaces.
Junos OS supports Layer 2 port mirroring to a remote collector over a GRE interface.
To configure layer 2 port-mirroring over a GRE interface, do the following:
1. Configure the GRE interface with the source and destination address.
[edit interfaces inteface-name unit unit-number tunnel]
set source ip-address
set destination ip-address
2. Configure family bridge parameters on the GRE interface.
[edit interfaces interface-name unit unit-number family bridge]
set interface-mode trunk
set vlan-id valn-id
1142
3. Configure the rate at which the input packets are mirrored.
[edit forwarding-options port-mirroring]
set f input rate rate
4. Configure the output interface for family VPLS for the GRE interface.
[edit forwarding-options family vpls]
set output interface gre-interface-name
5. Configure the firewall filter term for family bridge to count packets arriving at the interface.
[edit firewall family bridge]
set filter f1 term term then count count
6. Configure firewall filter term for family bridge to mirror the packets.
[edit firewall family bridge]
set filter filter-name term term then port-mirror

Port mirroring is the ability of a router to send a copy of a packet to an external host address or a packet
analyzer for analysis. One application for port mirroring sends a duplicate packet to a virtual tunnel. A
next-hop group can then be configured to forward copies of this duplicate packet to several interfaces.
Starting with Junos OS Release 16.1, Layer 2 port mirroring to a remote collector over a GRE interface is
supported.
Topology
Figure 41 on page 1143 shows port mirroring configured over a GRE interface. The interface gr-4/0/0 is
configured as family bridge. Firewall family bridge filter f1 is configured as port-mirror. Mirror
destination is configured as gr-4/0/0. Firewall family bridge filter f1 is applied at the ingress and egress
of the xe-3/2/5.0 interface, which mirrors packets to mirror destination gr-4/0/0.
