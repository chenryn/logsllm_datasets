User:  How to ping test the connectivity of the server through the command line tool?
Assistant: Enter the `ping` command in the command line tool, followed by the IP address or domain name of the server, as follows: ``` ping <server_ip_address_or_domain_name> ``` For example, to test the connection to Google, enter the following command: ``` ping www.google.com ``` The command line will send continuous packets to the target server, and display the response time and success rate. Press Ctrl+C to stop the test. On the Windows system, you can specify the number of data packets to be sent by the parameter `-n`, as follows: ``` ping -n 10 www.google.com ``` This will send 10 data packets to Google, and display the result. On Linux and Mac systems, this parameter is `-c`.
