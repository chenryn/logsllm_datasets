### Query
Is it possible to modify the `PATH` environment variable globally and permanently in a platform-independent way using Python (distutils)?

### Background
I am developing an installer for a plugin for Serna XML Editor, and I plan to use Python's `distutils` (via `setup.py`). After installation, the `setup.py` script needs to add the installation directory to the `PATH` environment variable.

One potential solution is to copy the executables to a directory like `/usr/local/bin`, but this approach is not straightforward on Windows, as the appropriate directory for executables is not immediately clear.

### Possible Solution
Unfortunately, `distutils` does not provide functionality to set environment variables. On Windows, modifying the `PATH` would involve editing the Windows Registry, which can be complex and error-prone. On UNIX-like systems, it would require identifying and editing the correct shell configuration file (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`), which is generally not recommended. Instead, users are typically advised to manually edit their `PATH` or use full paths to the executables.
