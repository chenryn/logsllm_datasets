User: Is that possible to modify PATH environment variable, globally and permanently, in a platform-independent way using Python (distutils)?
Background
I have some application (a plugin for Serna XML Editor), and now I'm going to make an installer for it, probably using python distutils (setup.py). After the installation setup.py needs to modify the PATH environment variable to add the installation directory to its value.
A possible solution to achieve what I want would be to copy the executables to /usr/local/bin or somewhere else, but for MS Windows it is not obvious where to copy execs.
Any ideas?
Assistant: Distutils doesnâ€™t set environment variables.  On Windows, this would imply mucking with the registry; on UNIX, it would require to find out the right shell configuration file (which is not trivial) and edit it, which is just not done in this culture: people are told to edit their $PATH or to use full paths to the programs.
