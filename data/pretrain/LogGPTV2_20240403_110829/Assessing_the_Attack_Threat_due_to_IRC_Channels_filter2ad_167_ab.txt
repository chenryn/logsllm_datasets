because commands can be sent without traveling through 
the IRC server, and since DCC chat is the method used 
to  send  a  bot  commands  during 
runtime,  such 
connections could indicate attempts to take over bots. A 
private message was considered malicious if it contained 
sexually explicit or threatening language, and these were 
considered  attacks  for  the  purpose  of  this  experiment 
because they indicate unwanted and possibly dangerous 
attention  towards  the  user  from  others  in  the  channel. 
These  attacks  were  collected  and  separated  from  one 
another  by  the  logging  capability  of  the  Eggdrop  bots. 
Eggdrop  provides  several  flags  that  can  be  used  to  log 
different types of messages and commands. For each bot, 
five  logs  were  kept,  including  the  public  text  in  the 
channel,  private  messages  to  the  bot,  user  joins/kicks, 
server  commands,  and  file  transfers.  Public  text  was 
logged to see if there was any discussion in the channel 
generated  by  the  bots’  conversations  with  each  other. 
Joins/kicks  were

on the Attack Threat 
Experiment One: Impact of User Activity 
The  first  experiment  was  designed  to  determine  if 
increased activity in an IRC channel increased the threat 
of  attack.  Three  pairs  of  bots  were  deployed  in  three  
different  channels  (i.e.,  #teens,  #guildwars  and  #wow), 
one pair used the very talkative script, one pair used the 
slightly  talkative  script,  and  one  pair  was  completely 
silent.  All  three  channels  had  around  400  users  at  any 
given  time.  The  silent  pair  was  the  control,  and  the 
average  number  of  attacks  per  day  they  received  was 
compared to the slightly and very talkative bots to see if 
there  was  a  link  between  activity  and  attacks.  All  bots 
had  male  names  (i.e.,  Andy,  Brad,  Dan,  Gregg  and 
Kevin). The name of the bot was changed from one week 
to another but was selected among these five names. The 
logs for each bot were collected and the average number 
of each type of attack per day, per channel and for each 
kind  of  bot  was  calculated.  Since  all  three  channels 
contained a similar number of users, these results do not 
need  to  be  normalized  by  the  number  of  users  per 
channel.  The  number  of  different  types  of  attacks  per 
day,  shown  in  Table  1,  is  based  on  four  weeks  of 
collected  data.  Table  1  contains  the  95%  confidence 
interval around the mean assuming a normal distribution 
of the different attack types.

All  bots  received  on  average  one  or  fewer  file 
connection attempts a day. Note that the average number 
of attempts increases from silent bots to slightly talkative 
and  to  very  talkative  ones.  The  number  of  DCC 
connections  was  low  for  all  three  types  of  bots.  The 
silent  bots  received  the  highest  number  of  private 
messages:  on  average  about  2.5  more  malicious private 
messages  than  the  very  talkative  bots  and  1.7  more 
malicious  messages  than  slightly  talkative  bots.  This 
result is particularly interesting since intuitively a higher 
number  of  attacks  would  be  launched  against  more 
talkative  bots.  The  number  of  links  sent  to  a  bot  was 
almost  equal  for  the  three  types  of  bots.  The  results 
indicated  that  there  was  no  huge  difference  in  attack 
frequency  between  the  very  talkative,  slightly  talkative, 
and  silent  bots.  This  experiment  showed  that  increased 
activity in an IRC channel does not significantly increase 
the threat of attack.

Experiment Two: Impact of User Gender 
The  second  experiment  investigated  whether  or  not 
the gender of the username had an affect on the number 
of attacks received. The layout in the channels changed 
to three silent bots, one with a female name, one with a 
male  name,  and  one  with  an  ambiguous  name.  The 
female  names  consisted  of  Cathy,  Elyse,  Irene,  Melissa

and Stephanie. The male names were Andy, Brad, Dan, 
Gregg  and  Kevin.  The  ambiguous  names  consisted  of 
Nightwolf,  Orgoth,  Redwings  and  Stargazer.  The  name 
of  the  bot  was  changed  from  one  week  to  another  but 
was  selected  among  these  five female, male names and 
four ambiguous names. 
The  bots  were  all  silent  because,  based  on  the 
conclusion of the first experiment, channel activity was 
no  longer  considered  a  factor.  The  three  identical 
channels  (i.e.,  #teens,  #guildwars  and  #wow)  were 
selected. For the bots with female names, six bots (i.e., 
two per channel) were run for two weeks and three bots 
(i.e., one per channel) were run for four weeks. For the 
bots  with  male  names,  six  bots  (i.e.,  two  per  channel) 
were  run  for  four  weeks  and  three  bots  (i.e.,  one  per 
channel) were run for another four weeks. For the bots 
with ambiguous names, three bots were run during four 
weeks  (i.e.,  one  per  channel).  The  number  of  different 
types of attacks per day, per channel and for each kind of 
bot  is  shown  in  Table  2.  It  also  contains  the  95% 
confidence interval around the mean assuming a normal 
distribution  of  the  different  attack  types.  As  mentioned 
for  the  first  experiment,  all  three  channels  contained  a 
similar number of users, thus the results do not need to 
be normalized by the number of users per channel.

The  female  bots  received  on  average  100  malicious 
private  messages  a  day,  exceeding  by  far  the  totals  of 
any of the other bots, with the other attack types being 
roughly equal. It is interesting to note that the bots with 
ambiguous names received significantly more malicious 
private messages (on average 25) than the male bots (on 
average 3.7), but less than the average between the male 
and  female  bots  (which  is  around  52).  This  experiment 
shows  that  the  user  gender  has  a  significant  impact  on 
one  component  of  the  attack  threat  (i.e.,  the  number  of 
malicious  private  messages  received  for  which  the 
female  bots  received  more  than  25  times  more  private 
messages than the male bots and 4 more times than the 
bots with an ambiguous name) and no significant impact 
on the other components on the attack threat. Indeed, for 
each of the three types of bots, on average, less than 0.5 
files were sent per day and 0.1 DCC connections and 2 
links sent to a bot were observed per day.

Experiment Three: Comparison of 
Since  the  conversation  scripts  were  no longer being 
used for the bots, there was no longer a definitive reason 
why  their  role  could  not  be  filled  by  open  human 
connections. This allowed for the placement of users in 
channels in networks that did not allow bots, in order to
