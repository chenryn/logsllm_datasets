internetwork is always an IPv4 internetwork, either the Internet or a private intranet. 
Figure 14-1 shows the components of a VPN connection based on Windows.

Attributes of a VPN Connection 
Windows-based VPNs have the following attributes: 
User authentication 
Chapter 14 – Virtual Private Networking 
TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows  
Page: 403 
Encapsulation 
Encryption 
User Authentication 
Before the VPN connection is established, the VPN server authenticates the security credentials of the 
user that is using the VPN client computer. If mutual authentication is being used, the VPN client also 
either authenticates the security credentials of the VPN server or verifies that the VPN server has 
access to the user credentials of the VPN client. Mutual authentication provides protection against 
masquerading VPN servers. 
Encapsulation 
VPN technology encapsulates private data with additional headers that allow it to traverse the transit 
internetwork. 
Encryption 
To ensure confidentiality of the data as it traverses the shared or public transit internetwork, the sender 
encrypts the data, and the receiver decrypts it. Encryption and decryption depend on both the sender 
and the receiver determining a shared encryption key. 
Anyone who intercepts packets sent along the VPN connection in the transit internetwork must have the 
encryption key to decipher them. The length of the encryption key is an important security parameter. 
Computational techniques can be used to determine the encryption key. Such techniques require more 
computing power and computational time as the encryption key gets longer. Therefore, you should use 
the largest possible key size. 
In addition, the more information that you encrypt with the same key, the easier it is to decipher the 
encrypted data. With some encryption technologies, you can configure how often the encryption keys 
are changed during a connection. 
For VPN connections that are based on PPTP, Windows supports Microsoft Point-to-Point Encryption 
(MPPE) with 40-bit, 56-bit, or 128-bit encryption keys. For VPN connections that are based on 
L2TP/IPsec, Windows supports Data Encryption Standard (DES) with a 56-bit key or Triple-DES with 
three 56-bit keys.  For VPN connections that are based on SSTP, Windows Vista with Service Pack 1 
and Windows Server 2008 supports Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) with RC4 or Advanced Encryption 
Standard (AES) and 128-bit keys. 
Types of VPN Connections 
Windows-based VPNs support both remote access and site-to-site VPN connections. 
Remote Access  
A remote access VPN connection is made by a remote access VPN client (a single computer) when 
connecting to a private network. The VPN server provides access not only to the resources of the 
server but also to the entire network to which the server is attached. The packets sent across the VPN 
connection originate at the remote access client. 
Chapter 14 – Virtual Private Networking 
TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows  
Page: 404 
The remote access VPN client authenticates itself to the remote access VPN server, and, for mutual 
authentication, the server authenticates itself to the client or provides proof that it has access to the 
client's credentials. 
When a remote access VPN client connects to the Internet, the client is configured with a default route 
that points to the Internet. This default route makes all the destinations of the Internet reachable. For 
permanent connections to the Internet (such as those using a Digital Subscriber Line [DSL] or a cable 
modem), the default route is automatically added to the IPv4 routing table when the Internet connection 
is configured with a default gateway IPv4 address (either statically or dynamically). For dial-up 
connections to the Internet, a default route is automatically added to the IPv4 routing table when the 
connection is made. 
When the remote access VPN connection is made, a new default route is added to the routing table 
and the existing default route has its routing metric increased. Now all default route traffic is sent over 
the VPN connection to the private intranet, rather than to the Internet. When the VPN connection is 
terminated, the newly created default route is removed and the original default route's routing metric is 
returned to its previous value. 
This behavior produces the following results: 
Before the VPN connection is made, all the locations on the Internet are reachable, but intranet 
locations are not. 
After the VPN connection is made, all the locations on the intranet are reachable, but Internet locations 
are not (with the exception of the VPN server on the Internet). 
You can control the automatic creation of the new default route by opening the properties of the Internet 
Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) or Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) component of a dial-up or VPN connection, 
clicking Advanced, and selecting or clearing the Use default gateway on remote network check box 
on the General tab, as Figure 14-2 shows. 
Figure 14-2  The Advanced TCP/IP Settings dialog box for a VPN connection 
Chapter 14 – Virtual Private Networking 
TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows

VPN client users typically engage in either intranet or Internet communication, not both simultaneously. 
These users do not have a problem with mutually exclusive access to either Internet locations or to 
intranet locations. However, in some cases, users need simultaneous access to intranet and Internet 
resources. 
If your VPN users need simultaneous access to intranet and Internet resources when the VPN 
connection is active, you can do one of the following: 
Select the Use default gateway on remote network check box (the default setting), and allow Internet 
access through the organization intranet. Internet traffic between the VPN client and Internet hosts 
passes though firewalls or proxy servers as if the VPN client were physically connected to the 
organization intranet. Although performance may be decreased, this method allows you to filter and 
monitor Internet access according to your organization's network policies while the VPN client is 
connected to the organization network. 
When the VPN server assigns an IPv4 address to the VPN client, ensure that the subnet mask is set to 
the same class-based subnet mask of the Internet address class of the IPv4 address. If the addressing 
within your intranet is based on a single class-based address prefix, clear the Use default gateway on 
remote network check box. The best example is when your intranet is using the private IPv4 address 
prefix of 10.0.0.0/8. 
If the addressing within your intranet is not based on a single class-based address prefix, you can use 
one of the following solutions: 
The DHCPInform message sent by VPN clients running Windows includes a request for the 
Classless Static Routes DHCP option. On your DHCP server running Windows Server 2008 or 
Windows Server 2003, configure the Classless Static Routes DHCP option for the appropriate 
scope to contain a set of routes that represent the address space of your intranet. These routes are 
automatically added to the routing table of the requesting VPN client.  
By using the Connection Manager Administration Kit (CMAK) for Windows Server 2008 or 
Windows Server 2003, you can configure specific routes as part of the Connection Manager profile 
that you distribute to VPN users. You can also specify a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) that 
contains the current set of organization intranet routes or additional routes beyond those that you 
configure in the profile. 
Site-to-Site 
A site-to-site VPN connection (also known as a router-to-router VPN connection) is made by a router 
and connects two portions of a private network. The VPN server provides a routed connection to the 
network to which the server is attached. On a site-to-site VPN connection, the packets that either router 
sends across the VPN connection typically do not typically originate at the routers. 
The calling router (the VPN client) authenticates itself to the answering router (the VPN server), and, for 
mutual authentication, the answering router authenticates itself to the calling router or provides proof 
that it has access to the calling router's credentials. 
Site-to-site VPN connections can be initiated by only one router (a one-way initiated VPN connection) 
or by either router (a two-way initiated VPN connection). One-way initiated connections are well suited 
to a spoke-and-hub topology in which only the branch office router can initiate the connection. Site-to-
Chapter 14 – Virtual Private Networking 
TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows  
Page: 406 
site VPN connections can be permanent (always connected) or on-demand (a router makes a 
connection when it has traffic to send and disconnects after a configured idle timeout). 
To support site-to-site connections, Routing and Remote Access in Windows Server 2008 and 
Windows Server 2003 allows you to create demand-dial interfaces. A demand-dial interface is a logical 
interface that represents the point-to-point connection between the two routers. You can use a demand-
dial interface in the same way as a physical interface. For example, you can assign routes and 
configure packet filters on demand-dial interfaces. 
Routing for site-to-site connections consists of a set of routes in the routing table of both the calling 
router and the answering router. These routes summarize the addresses that are available across the 
site-to-site connection. Each separate route specifies: 
An address prefix (the combination of the destination and a subnet mask)  
The routing metric 
A demand-dial interface 
If each router in a site-to-site connection has the set of routes that represent the addresses available 
across the site-to-site connection, all of the locations on the intranet consisting of multiple sites are 
reachable from each site.

VPN Protocols 
Computers running Windows Vista, Windows XP, Windows Server 2008, or Windows Server 2003 use 
the following protocols to create VPN connections: 
Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) 
PPTP 
L2TP/IPsec 
Computers running Windows Vista with Service Pack 1 and later or Windows Server 2008 also use 
SSTP. 
Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) 
PPTP and L2TP depend heavily on the features specified for PPP, which was designed to send data 
across dial-up or dedicated point-to-point connections. For IPv4, PPP encapsulates IPv4 packets within 
PPP frames and then transmits the packets across a point-to-point link. PPP was originally defined as 
the protocol to use between dial-up clients and remote access servers. 
The four phases of negotiation in a PPP connection are the following: 
Phase 1: PPP Link Establishment 
Phase 2: User Authentication 
Phase 3: PPP Callback Control 
Phase 4: Invoking Network Layer Protocol(s) 
Each of these four phases must complete successfully before the PPP connection can transfer user 
data.  
Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 support IPv6 traffic over PPP links. Neither Windows 
Server 2003 nor Windows XP supports IPv6 traffic over PPP links, so you cannot send native IPv6 
traffic across a dial-up or VPN connection from a computer running one of these operating systems. 
You can, however, send tunneled IPv6 traffic that is encapsulated with an IPv4 header. For more 
information about IPv6 tunneling, see Chapter 15 "IPv6 Transition Technologies." 
Phase 1: PPP Link Establishment 
PPP uses the Link Control Protocol (LCP) to establish, maintain, and terminate the logical point-to-point 
connection. During Phase 1, basic communication options are selected. For example, authentication 
protocols are selected, but they are not used for authentication until the connection authentication 
phase (Phase 2). Similarly, during Phase 1, the two peers negotiate the use of compression or 
encryption. The actual choice of compression and encryption algorithms and other details occurs during 
Phase 4. 
Phase 2: User Authentication 
In Phase 2, the client computer sends the user’s credentials to the remote access server. An 
authentication scheme should provide protection against replay attacks and remote client 
impersonation. A replay attack occurs when an attacker monitors a successful connection and uses 
Chapter 14 – Virtual Private Networking 
TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows  
Page: 408 
captured packets to play back the remote client’s response so that the attacker can gain an 
authenticated connection. Remote client impersonation occurs when an attacker takes over an 
authenticated connection. 
Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP support the following PPP authentication protocols:  
Password Authentication Protocol (PAP) 
PAP is a plaintext password authentication mechanism that provides no protection from an attacker 
that captures a PAP authentication exchange. 
Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) 
CHAP is an encrypted password authentication mechanism that avoids transmitting the password 
on the connection. 
Microsoft Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol (MS-CHAP) 
MS-CHAP is an encrypted password authentication mechanism similar to CHAP, but MS-CHAP is 
more secure. 
MS-CHAP version 2 (MS-CHAP v2) 
MS-CHAP v2 is an enhanced version of MS-CHAP that provides stronger protection for the 
exchange of user name and password credentials, determination of encryption keys, and mutual 
authentication. 
Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) 
EAP is a PPP authentication infrastructure that allows authentication mechanisms to be installed on 
PPP clients and servers. During the authentication phase, EAP does not authenticate users. Phase 
2 for EAP only negotiates the use of a common EAP authentication mechanism known as an EAP 
type. The actual authentication for the negotiated EAP type is performed during Phase 4. 
Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 no longer support the MS-CHAP authentication protocol.  
During Phase 2 of PPP link configuration, the VPN server running Windows Server 2008 or Windows 
Server 2003 collects the authentication credentials and then validates them against one of the 
following: 
The VPN server's own user accounts database (if the VPN server is not a member of a domain) 
A domain controller for Active Directory (if the VPN server is a member of a domain) 
A Remote Authentication Dial-in User Service (RADIUS) server 
A VPN server running Windows Vista or Windows XP validates authentication credentials against the 
local user account database. 
VPN connections that are based on PPTP require the use of MS-CHAP, MS-CHAP v2, or the EAP-
Transport Layer Security (TLS) authentication protocol. These authentication methods generate 
encryption key material that is used to encrypt the data sent over the PPTP-based VPN connection. 
L2TP/IPsec connections can use any of the authentication protocols because the authentication 
protocol exchange is encrypted with IPsec. However, the use of MS-CHAP v2 or EAP-TLS is 
recommended because they are the most secure user authentication protocols and they provide mutual 
authentication.

TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows

Phase 3: PPP Callback Control 
The Windows implementation of PPP includes an optional callback control phase. This phase uses the 
Callback Control Protocol (CBCP) immediately after the authentication phase. If configured for callback, 
both the remote client and remote access server disconnect after authentication. The remote access 
server then calls the remote client back at a specified phone number. This behavior makes dial-up 
connections more secure because the remote access server allows connections only from remote 
clients that are using specific phone numbers. Callback is used only for dial-up connections, not for 
VPN connections. 
Phase 4: Invoking Network Layer Protocol(s) 
When the first three phases have been completed, PPP invokes the various network control protocols 
(NCPs) that were selected during the link establishment phase (Phase 1) to configure protocols used by 
the remote client. For example, during this phase, the Internet Protocol Control Protocol (IPCP) assigns 
an IPv4 address to the PPP client. In the Windows implementation of PPP, the Compression Control 
Protocol (CCP) is used to negotiate both data compression, known as Microsoft Point-to-Point 
Compression (MPPC), and data encryption with MPPE. 
Data-Transfer Phase 
When the four phases of PPP negotiation have been completed, PPP begins to forward packets 
containing data between the PPP client and the server. Each transmitted data packet is wrapped in a 
PPP header that is removed by the receiver. If data compression was selected in Phase 1 and 
negotiated in Phase 4, the sender compresses the data before transmitting it. If data encryption is 
negotiated, the sender encrypts the data before transmitting it. If both encryption and compression are 
negotiated, the sender compresses the data before encrypting and transmitting it. 
Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) 
Request for Comments (RFC) 2637 defines PPTP, which encapsulates PPP frames in IPv4 packets for 
transmission over an IPv4 internetwork, such as the Internet. PPTP can be used for remote access and 
site-to-site VPN connections.  
PPTP uses a TCP connection for tunnel management and a modified version of Generic Routing 
Encapsulation (GRE) to encapsulate PPP frames for tunneled data. The payloads of the encapsulated 
PPP frames can be encrypted, compressed, or both. Figure 14-3 shows the structure of a PPTP packet 
that contains an IPv4 packet. 
Figure 14-3  Structure of a PPTP packet that contains an IPv4 packet 
Chapter 14 – Virtual Private Networking 
TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows  
Page: 410 
Layer Two Tunneling Protocol with IPsec (L2TP/IPsec) 
RFC 2661 defines L2TP, which encapsulates PPP frames to be sent over IPv4, X.25, Frame Relay, or 
Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) networks. If you configure L2TP for IPv4 networks, you can use it 
as a tunneling protocol over the Internet. 
L2TP over IPv4 internetworks uses a User Datagram Protocol (UDP) header and a series of L2TP 
messages for tunnel management. L2TP also uses UDP to send L2TP-encapsulated PPP frames as 
the tunneled data. The payloads of encapsulated PPP frames can be encrypted, compressed, or both, 
although the Windows implementation of L2TP does not use MPPE to encrypt the PPP payload. Figure 
14-4 shows the structure of an L2TP packet that contains an IPv4 packet. 
Figure 14-4  Structure of an L2TP packet that contains an IPv4 packet 
The Windows implementation of L2TP uses IPsec with Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) to 
encrypt L2TP traffic. The combination of L2TP (the tunneling protocol) and IPsec (the method of
