User: Please list some network security attack and defense technologies, including but not limited to firewall, VPN, IDS, etc. And a brief introduction to each technology.
Assistant: 1. Firewall (Firewall): Firewall is a technology used to protect computer networks from illegal intrusion. It mainly realizes security protection by controlling the inflow and outflow of network data packets. Firewalls secure computer networks by filtering, throttling, and logging non-compliant network requests. 2. VPN (Virtual Private Network): VPN is a virtual private network, which can protect the security of network data by using encryption protocols and connecting to another physical network. With a VPN, users can achieve privacy and data protection while using insecure public networks such as the Internet. VPN usually has multiple encryption protocols, such as SSL, IPSec, and PPTP. 3. IDS (Intrusion Detection System): IDS is a security technology that detects and warns of illegal intrusions in computer networks. IDS mainly collects and analyzes computer network data packets on a regular basis, discovers possible attacks in the network, and takes timely defensive measures to ensure network security. IDS is divided into active type and passive type. Active IDS can also predict and simulate network attack behavior. 4. IPS (Intrusion Prevention System): IPS is an upgraded version based on IDS. It can not only detect network attacks, but also automatically implement attack defense measures, such as disconnecting network connections. IPS is mainly divided into active and passive. Active IPS has stronger attack defense capabilities, but may misjudge normal network operations. 5. WAF (Web Application Firewall): WAF is mainly used to protect web applications from network attacks. WAF can intercept the transmitted data flow between the web application and the web server and perform in-depth inspection on it, and defend against common network attacks through a series of advanced security technologies, such as SQL injection attacks and cross-site scripting attacks. 6. Honeypot: Honeypot is a technology designed to attract hackers in order to analyze their activities to detect and predict cybersecurity threats. It can be deployed on hosts or networks, simulate vulnerable systems, and regularly collect and analyze attack data to provide better security strategies for enterprises. But Honeypot also has the problem of high deployment and maintenance costs. 7. DLP (Data Loss Prevention): DLP is a technology used to protect enterprise information assets and prevent data leakage and data loss. DLP mainly identifies and monitors confidential information data circulating in the organization, such as bank account numbers, confidential documents, etc., in order to detect and prevent information leakage incidents in a timely manner. DLP can also further protect corporate information through features such as data encryption and access control.
