User: I'm having trouble upgrading from PIL to PILLOW on my mac. I tried "brew install libtiff lbjpeg webp littlecms" but homebrew couldn't find the lbjpeg - any tips?
Assistant: Reinstall X11 from XQuartz.org 
Install the latest XCode  
Install the command line tools:
xcode-select --install

Worked for me on mavericks
