A.3 Educator Survey Coding Disagreements 
We  include  all  11  cases  where  the  primary  coder’s  and  the 
secondary coder’s coding results did not agree. The examples are 
given  below,  along  with  the  quotes  from  the  survey  which  were 
primarily  responsible  for  the  distinction  between  the  coding 
results. 
As  mentioned  in  Section  5.1,  except  for  one  case  in  which  the 
secondary coder misread the data and coded an error (Case 6), the 
primary coder’s results—the results reported in the paper—always 
represent the stricter of the two viewpoints. That is, in the Results 
Section  we  report  the  upper  bound  on  our  interpretation  of  the 
critiques  to  the game  and  the  lower  bound  on  the  game’s  role  in 
engagement and awareness. 
A.3.1 Positive Role 
Below we provide information on the cases where the primary and 
reliability  coder  disagreed  when  coding  the  positive  role(s)  that 
the  game  performed.  In  all  cases,  the  reliability  coder  coded  the 
game as playing the role, while the primary coder did not. Quotes 
that  led  the  reliability  coder  to  code  the  game  as  “Social  / 
Engagement” or “Awareness” are given below. 
Social / Engagement: 
  Case 1 (E11-checkout). “It was a 7/10. the students enjoyed 
it but the word did not spread around and ignite students.” 
  Case  2  (E12-classroom).  “Students  reported  that  they 
enjoyed  the game, but  that the hour twenty was  pushing the 
limit.” 
  Case 3 (E16-classroom). “The kids were all engaged with the 
game and playing it through.” “Would rate it 8/10." 
  Case  4  (E22-vetting).  “They  seemed  engaged,  although  not 
so much that I would expect they would play it for fun." 
Awareness:  
  Case 5 (E21-lunch). “Brought up some terminology that staff 
and IT had not heard before. "pwned" :-)” 
A.3.2 Critiques and Tradeoffs 
Below we provide information on the cases where the primary and 
reliability  coder  disagreed  when  coding  critiques  made  to  the 
game. In all cases except one (Case 6, coded in error), the primary 
coder  coded  the  educator  as  offering  that  critique,  while  the 
reliability coder did not. Quotes that led primary coder to code the 
critique are given below. 
Takes a long time to learn: 
  Case  6  (E10-classroom):  The  disagreement  was  due  to  the 
reliability  coder  misreading  the  response.  The  reference  to 
the  presentation  and  the  gameplay  taking  too  long  together 
  Case 7 (E1-classroom): [Q: What, if anything, would you do 
differently if you were to do the activity again?] “have more 
play time during the topic" 
Not enough fun:  
  Case 8 (E22-vetting): “They seemed engaged, though not so 
much that I would expect them to play it for fun” 
Not enough educational value: 
  Case  9  (E2-ACM):  “Learning  was  not  so  much  learned 
throughout  the  game,  but  it  did  pose  interesting  questions 
that the students were curious about” 
  Case 10 (E3-vetting): “I worry the card game will seem like 
a card game” 
  Case  11  (E12-classroom):  “Most  students  reported  a  low 
level  of  learning,  the  topics  that  were  reported  positively 
were presenting the students with real world context for what 
they were learning” 
A.4 Control-Alt-Hack-themed Assignments 
5 of the 14 educators who used Control-Alt-Hack in the classroom 
reported using a custom assignment in  concert with  the game, as 
described below: 
E4-classroom  (12  undergraduate  students  with  little  or  no 
prior  security  experience):  Students  were  asked  to  identify  at 
least  three  tasks  from  Mission  cards  that  seemed  interesting.  A 
follow-up  exercise  may  be  to  have  them  research  real-life 
situations where the theme of one of the tasks is involved.  
E7-classrooom  (56  undergraduate  students  in  a  Cyber-
Security  and  Information  Assurance  course,  with  little  or  no 
prior  security  experience):  Students  were  asked  to  take  a 
scenario  from  a  card  and  craft  a  research  paper  inspired  by  the 
scenario.  
E10-classroom  (65  high  school  students  in  a  Game  Design 
course  with  little  or  no  security  background):  Students  were 
required  to  answer  essay  questions  about  the  game  and  how  it  is 
put  together.  Optional  questions  asked  about  the  game’s  relation 
to the IT industry and hacker culture. 
E12-classroom  (22  undergraduates  in  a  Computer  Security 
Course  with  prior  educational  security  experience):  Students 
wrote one to two paragraphs discussing the activity.  
E18-classroom (30 undergraduate students in a Fundamentals 
of  Information  Security  course  with  a  variety  of  security 
backgrounds).  Two  questions  were  asked  before  the  game:  (1) 
What does information security mean to you?; and (2) What skills 
are  required  in  white-hat  hacking?  Two  questions  were  asked 
after  the  game:  (1)  Did  your  answers  to  the  previous  questions 
change  as  a  result  of  the  game—and  if  so,  how?;  and  (2)  As  a 
result  of  the  game,  did  you  discover  any  threats  you  hadn’t 
considered—and if so, what? 
While some of the above assignments are similar to activities we 
propose on our web site (http://www.controlalthack.com), some of 
the  assignments  are  original  and  demonstrate  an  interesting 
integration of the game into existing course plans and practices.
