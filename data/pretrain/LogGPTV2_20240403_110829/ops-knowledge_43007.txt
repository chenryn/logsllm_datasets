Question: "You are tasked with securing a mobile application that must encrypt sensitive data before storage. Which of the following approaches to initializing the encryption process is recommended for ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of the data?"
 "A": "Using a cryptographically secure random number generator to produce a unique and non-predictable initialization vector (IV) for each encrypted message."
 "B": "Reusing a single, hard-coded initialization vector (IV) for all encrypted messages to maintain consistency across application sessions."
 "C": "Employing a predictable IV that increments with each new message to simplify the decryption process for authorized users."
 "D": "Choosing a well-known string as the IV to ensure that the encryption algorithm can be easily implemented on different platforms."
Answer: A
