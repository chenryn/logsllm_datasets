User: I am working on a social-network type of application on App Engine, and would like to send multiple images to the client based on a single get request. In particular, when a client loads a page, they should see all images that are associated with their account. 
I am using python on the server side, and would like to use Javascript/JQuery on the client side to decode/display the received images.
The difficulty is that I would like to only perform a single query on the server side (ie. query for all images associated with a single user) and send all of the images resulting from the query to the client as a single unit, which will then be broken up into the individual images. Ideally, I would like to use something similar to JSON, but while JSON appears to allow multiple "objects" to be sent as a JSON response, it does not appear to have the ability to allow multiple images (or binary files) to be sent as a JSON response. 
Is there another way that I should be looking at this problem, or perhaps a different technology that I should be considering that might allow me to send multiple images to the client, in response to a single get request?
Thank you and Kind Regards
Alexander
Assistant: As an improvement to Alex's answer, there's no need to use memcache: Simply do a keys-only query to get a list of keys of images you want to send to the client, then use db.get() to fetch the image corresponding to the required key for each image request. This requires roughly the same amount of effort as a single regular query.
