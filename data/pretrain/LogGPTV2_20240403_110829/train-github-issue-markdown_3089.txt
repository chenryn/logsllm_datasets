The objectives right now are pretty confusing:
  * Your green-box class should give the bottom of elements 20px of padding.
  * Your green-box class should give the left of elements 40px of padding.
This suggests, to me at least, that through Clockwise Notation it is possible
to assign padding to just the Bottom and Just the Left. Total NewB here, but
it seems to me that you have to assign it to the top/bottom and left/right. I
can't find anyway other than padding-bottom, etc to change the top without
changing the top.
