ABSTRACT
Trusted computing plays a pivotal role to facilitate a party to
evaluate the integrity of others or to ensure desired security
assurance, which is a very challenging task in large-scale and
heterogeneous computing environments. Built upon the suc-
cess from 2006 to 2011, the seventh ACM Workshop on Scal-
able Trusted Computing continues to serve as a forum for
researchers as well as practitioners to disseminate and dis-
cuss recent advances and emerging issues. This proceedings
includes selected papers that focus on system architectures,
enabling mechanisms, and novel applications of trusted com-
puting.

1. BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION
Trusted computing (TC) techniques aim to provide sys-
tematic protection and its veri(cid:12)able evidence of a computing
platform. Software-based trusted computing systems have
been studied for decades, including trusted operating sys-
tems, database systems, and middleware. During the last
decade, the security research community has recognized that
software-only cannot provide a high degree of trust since
there are too many avenues for software-based attacks in
variant systems. Leading by hardware vendors, industry
started to build security-strength trusted hardware. The
Trusted Computing Group (TCG) and earlier Trusted Com-
puting Platform Alliance (TCPA) have developed speci(cid:12)ca-
tions for a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) to provide a
hardware root of trust for various purposes on a client com-
puter. Later processor vendors developed hardware-based
virtulization technologies, such as Intel LaGrande Technol-
ogy (LT) and Trusted Execution Technology (TXT), AMD
Paci(cid:12)ca Technology, and ARM TrustZone, which provide
fundamental trusted platform mechanisms such as memory

curtaining, trusted I/O path, and additional ring privileged
beyond the existing ring 0. By leveraging these advanced
processor capabilities, TPM-enabled systems provides new
application level integrity protection mechanisms such as
protected code execution environment, sealed data storage,
and remote attestation.
Recent years have witnessed signi(cid:12)cant progresses in TC
techniques, such as the Linux integrity measurement ar-
chitecture (IMA) based on the TPM speci(cid:12)cations, small
trusted computing base (TCB) for runtime execution with
dynamic root of trust and chip-based virtualization, and pri-
vacy enhanced remote attestation protocols. TCG-compliant
products have been developed and deployed in many aspects
of IT industry, such as TPM on nearly all PC and notebooks,
Trusted Network Connect (TNC) products for enterprise,
and disk encryption techniques (e.g., Microsoft BitLocker).
Nonetheless, in a society increasingly dependent on net-
worked and outsourced information systems, there are sev-
eral fundamental issues which have not been well-understood
and addressed for trusted computing, such as dynamic in-
tegrity measurement in application runtime environment,
and e(cid:14)cient remote attestation for power-constrained de-
vices. In the mean time, emerging computing systems such
as mobile platforms (e.g., smartphones), cloud computing,
and Internet-of-Things introduce new challenges for e(cid:14)cient,
scalable, and manageable trust computing.
2. CALL FOR PAPERS
Aiming to provide an arena for cutting-edge trusted com-
puting technologies and applications, ACM Workshop on
Scalable Trusted Computing (STC) (http://www.cs.utsa.
edu/~acmstc/) serves as a forum for researchers as well as
practitioners to disseminate and discuss recent advances and
emerging issues. Following the tradition of STC, STC 2012
is held with ACM CCS 2012, on Monday, Oct 15, 2012,
at Sheraton Raleigh Hotel, Raleigh, NC, USA. The work-
shop solicits two types of original papers:

not limited to) topics:
(cid:15) security policies and models of trusted computing
(cid:15) architecture and implementation technologies
(cid:15) limitations, alternatives and tradeo(cid:11)s
(cid:15) trusted computing in cloud and data center

3. TECHNICAL PROGRAM
The program committee members include active researchers
from academia and industry in seven countries. We at-
tracted 14 submissions from 10 di(cid:11)erent countries, each of
which was reviewed by 4 PC members. Among them, 5 full
papers and 3 short papers are accepted to present in the
workshop, along with one invited paper.
The program consists of presentations of research papers
and invited talks. The research papers are organized in the
following three technical sessions:
(cid:15) Trusted computing architecture: This session fo-
cuses on designing and building trusted computing ar-
chitectures and frameworks to provide various security
facilities or services. The following papers are pre-
sented in this session: (1) Secure Processor Architec-
ture for Encrypted Computation on Untrusted Pro-
grams, by Christopher Fletcher, Marten van Dijk, and
Srini Devadas. This paper describes a processor ar-
chitecture for untrusted programs to run on encrypted
data. (2) Enforcing User-Space Privilege Separation
with Declarative Architectures, by Ben Niu and Gang
Tan. This paper describes an approach to run a single
binary process with multiple protection domains, with
di(cid:11)erent privileges and controlled inter-domain com-
munications. (3) JMF: Java Measurement Framework,
by Mark Thober, J. Aaron Pendergrass, and Andrew
Jurik. This paper presents a framework for measuring
the runtime integrity of Java bytecodes.
(cid:15) Trusted computing applications: Papers presented
in this section propose novel applications using cutting-
edge trusted computing techniques. The workshop ac-
cepts three papers for this session. (1) BottleCap: a
credential manager for capability systems, by Justin
King-Lacroix and Andrew Martin. The paper describes
the design and implementation of BottleCap, which is
a capability container based on Flicker and TPM. (2)

port, by Daniel Hein, Ronald Toegl, Martin Pirker,
Emil Gatial, Zolt(cid:19)an Balogh, Hans Brandl, and Ladislav
Hluch(cid:19)y. This paper presents a use case for secure mo-
bile agents to be used for crisis management support.
(3) Using Trustworthy Host-Based Information in the
Network, by Bryan Parno, Zongwei Zhou, and Adrian
Perrig. This is an invited paper describing a system
called Assayer,which provides trusted host-based data
in a network with a balance between useful data and
user privacy.
(cid:15) Trusted systems: This session consists of three pa-
pers building new security schemes in distributed sys-
tems and cloud computing.
(1) Targeted and Scal-
able Information Dissemination in a Distributed Rep-
utation System, by Rahim Delaviz, Johan Pouwelse,
and Dick Epema. The paper proposes two methods
to compute peer similarity for reputation evaluation
in peer-to-peer networks. (2) SybilControl: Practical
Sybil Defense with Computational Puzzles, by Frank
Li, Prateek Mittal, Matthew Caesar, and Nikita Borisov.
This paper describes a mechanism to protect against
Sybil attacks in a DHT by using computational puz-
zles. (3) Auditing Cloud Management Using Informa-
tion Flow Control, by Afshar Ganjali and David Lie.
This paper an auditing platform for cloud computing
called H-one which logs the (cid:13)ow of information be-
tween guest VMs and administrator’s processes.
The technical program also includes two keynote talks.
