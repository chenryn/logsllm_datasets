#22063 suggested adding a banner stating "this version is really old" but
modifying rust after the fact wasn't well liked. A better way would be to add
a conditional banner which checks rust-lang or something similar to see if
something new has been released. It should only appear if it's too old or
something similar.
It could even have grades:
  * Yellow: soon to be out of date
  * Orange: is out of date
  * Red: way out of date
Recently it came up on reddit.
