In the 0.x versions were 5 hooks:  
('args', 'pre_request', 'pre_send', 'post_request', 'response')
In 1.x there's only one: response
I've seen quite a few packages that used these hooks to manipulate the
requests objects before sending them, and now in v1.x there's not even a
single hook that allows them to do so.
This functionality is very much needed, and without it quite a few packages
simple cannot adapt to v1.x, and their alternative is to the sort-of-a-fork
requests-transition
