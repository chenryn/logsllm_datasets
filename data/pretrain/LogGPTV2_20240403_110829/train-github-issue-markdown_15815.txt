### Bug report
**The pixels plotted by`imshow` aren't of constant size. Some are larger than
others.**
**Code for reproduction**
    import numpy as np
    from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
    matrix = np.diag(np.ones(100))
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(4, 4))
    ax.imshow(matrix)
    fig.savefig('imshow.png')
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 10))
    ax.imshow(matrix)
    fig.savefig('imshow.pdf')
**Actual outcome**
It's quite visible on the following figure (`imshow.png` from the above code,
but also shown like that in jupyter) that some pixels are larger than others.
![imshow](https://user-
images.githubusercontent.com/6806065/53899959-b080f400-403b-11e9-8252-de3526cc1bdd.png)
While I assume it could be due to a low resolution image, the same happen for
a larger `figsize`, even if the file is saved in a vector format such as PDF.
Look (closely) at `imshow.pdf` from the above code.
**Expected outcome**
All pixels must be of the same size.
