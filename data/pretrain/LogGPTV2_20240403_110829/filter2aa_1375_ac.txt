In the middle of the timeline is today: 2010. This is the precipice where 
security leaders make critical technological and budgetary decisions about 
how best to protect their enterprises. This is also where iDefense analysts 
attempt to predict what the next year will bring to help its customers, who are 
some of the largest enterprise leaders in the world, make informed decisions.
In the near past is 2008, where brave technologists have deployed 
technologies early because they recognize the great potential for disruption. 
As such, they are willing to weather the bumps and bruises normally 
associated with early deployment of a technology that is not quite ready for 
wide distribution.
The numbered circles on the timeline show the iDefense estimates on 
how far out it considers each of these disruptors to be. The placement of 
the circles is based on iDefense research and observations made by the 
security community. As disruptors get closer to the present, they begin a 
transformation: within a year of the present, iDefense often identifies them 
as predictions for the following year. As each disruptor moves farther into 
the past, they most often take the form of security solutions. At this point, 
iDefense analysts consider them best practices and no longer disruptors.
It is worth noting that for any particular time, iDefense analysts will move 
each of these disruptors up and down the timeline depending on a number

Disruptors
of factors that affect how quickly the security community reacts to each 
disruptor. For example, two of the disruptors–massively multiplayer online 
environments (MMOs) and cyber terrorism–exist at the far end of the event 
horizon of 8-10 years. Others, such as cloud computing, developing nations 
and mobile platforms, already have early adopters but are probably 2-5 years 
from mainstream adoption. The remaining disruptors, including application 
stores, SCADA attacks, IPv6/DNSSEC/IPSEC deployment, and political and 
strategic hacking, have no real early adopters but are probably also 2-5 years 
from mainstream adoption.
In the following sections, iDefense updates the status of the original disruptors 
and provides additional depth on two: application stores and cloud computing. 
These sections are meant to highlight disruptors that iDefense believes require 
a closer look. For instance, iDefense malware analysts believe strongly that 
application stores will fundamentally change the way that organizations 
secure themselves from software-based threats.  Likewise, many iDefense 
vulnerability specialists believe that a vulnerable cloud will fundamentally 
change the perception of the cloud as a security solution. These discussions 
are less identifications of new disruptors than deeper looks at disruptors that 
iDefense has previously discussed.
2.2  Disruptor: Convergence of the “App Store” Model and Traditional 
Computing
The “app store” distribution model has become the de facto standard method 
for users to install programs onto mobile devices such as smartphones. 
Apple’s App Store is the largest application store in the market with more 
than 250,000 available applications and more than 6.5 billion downloaded 
applications; however, many mobile vendors, including Google, RIM, HP/Palm, 
Nokia and Microsoft, have implemented their own platforms.
Mobile devices with application stores have two security advantages over 
their traditional computing counterparts such as desktop and laptop PCs. 
First, only applications that developers have signed with a certificate provided 
by the app store proprietor can execute on the devices. The effect of this 
protection is that only applications created by known developers can run 
on the devices; if an application store proprietor discovers that a particular 
program is malicious, he or she can execute a “kill-switch” for the application 
by revoking the certificate. Second, app stores act as gateways between 
malware authors and the devices on which those authors want to run their 
malware. The proprietor of an app store can conduct reviews of programs 
before making them available to users, which prevents most malware from 
ever entering their platforms’ ecosystems.
These protections are far from perfect, as attackers have already introduced 
malware into app stores and discovered ways to disable the signed-code 
requirement that prevents the execution of unsigned programs. Despite these 
problems, systems that use the application store model have a much more 
defensible architecture than traditional desktop operating systems.

Cloud Computing
Year: 2011
Concept: Outsourcing automation 
resources to third-party vendors at greatly 
reduced costs compared to the costs of 
performing those tasks in house.
Impact: Adopting cloud computing 
services within an enterprise effectively 
moves critical infrastructure and intellectual 
property out of direct control by the 
enterprise. Conversely, having all data 
centrally located will likely provide increased 
incentive for attackers to compromise the 
cloud.
Enterprise Change: As cloud computing 
becomes more popular, the teams that 
are tasked with monitoring these third-
party vendors will grow and will become a 
dominant player in the security organization. 
Increased malicious scrutiny may prove the 
cloud to be less than ideal as a security 
solution.
Early Adopters: Yes (2009)
What has changed this year: According 
to Gartner, cloud computing has reached 
its peak of inflated expectations and is 2-5 
years from mainstream adoption.4
Mobile Platforms
Year: 2011
Concept: There has been a ubiquitous 
explosion of powerful computing devices on 
enterprise networks that both businesses 
and individuals use. As Walt Mossberg has 
said, the difference between a BlackBerry 
and a smartphone is that a BlackBerry is a 
cell phone that uses SMS trickery to allow 
Web browsing. 
Impact: Security features for these devices 
have not traditionally been strong.
Enterprise Change: Organizations are 
struggling to develop policy for use and 
basic enterprise protection.
Early Adopters: Yes (2008)
What has changed this year: Apple made 
a play to be an enterprise smartphone 
vendor by offering security features that 
heretofore have only been available on the 
BlackBerry.5 In addition, Apple launched the 
very popular iPad in 2010.

Disruptors
Many environments, including those of large enterprises, would benefit 
from using an OS that required that a trusted authority sign and vet every 
application. This whitelisting approach could be much more effective than 
the current solution driven by AV programs that seek out bad programs and 
remove them. 
On Oct. 18, 2010, Apple announced its plans to create a Mac App store, 
similar to the iOS App store, but for Mac OS X desktop applications.30 Adobe 
has also introduced the Adobe AIR Marketplace, an app store for programs 
that work through Adobe’s AIR platform.31 Intel’s AppUp is an app store that 
distributes applications specifically designed for Netbooks running Windows 
or Moblin.32 Many Linux distributions, such as Ubuntu and Fedora, already 
maintain software repositories that maintainers vet; users can access such 
repositories to install common programs. The app store model is already 
spreading to desktops, but the security benefit from this model is minor if the 
OS does not prevent untrusted programs from executing. 
Multiple technologies already exist that prevent untrusted programs 
from running on Windows. Windows 7 includes AppLocker, which allows 
administrators to configure policies that define applications that will and 
will not run on protected systems. AppLocker can prevent and allow the 
execution of programs based on their location on the system, their publisher 
and file hash. Third-party solutions, such as Bit9 Parity, perform a similar 
function by restricting executables that do not match characteristics defined 
by administrators. It is already possible to configure a Windows system 
that will not run any untrusted programs unless the attacker has exploited a 
vulnerability in the system.
These whitelisting technologies have yet to gain widespread adoption 
because they are either too complex to maintain or users view them as overly 
restrictive. A solution to both of these problems may be to deploy the app 
store model for traditional operating systems. Smartphone users have already 
accepted this model for their mobile devices and may be open to using a 
similar system for their desktop and laptop computers. A user-friendly app 
store for distributing software that administrators deem acceptable but do not 
include in default builds is key to gaining user acceptance. The application 
store model would allow administrators to distribute updates for these 
programs and keep track of every application in their environments. 
The logistics around the app store model on Windows may prove to be 
complex. Microsoft has faced allegations of monopoly practices in the past; if 
Microsoft in fact acted as its own vetting authority for all programs running on 
Windows, courts around the world could rule against the company. Microsoft’s 
dominance in the OS market means that no other player can have a significant 
impact on worldwide security by implementing the app store model. To 
implement the app store model in an acceptable way that provides a more 
secure platform, Microsoft would have to do the following:

Political and Strategic Hacking 
(APT)
Year: 2012
Concept: Nation-state cyber operations 
target government and commercial 
organizations for the purpose of intelligence 
gathering.
Impact: Intellectual property is seriously at 
risk.
Enterprise Change: Data loss protection 
services will become mainstream.
Early Adopters: Yes
What has changed this year: While most 
government entities have known about 
this issue for more than a decade, many 
commercial entities became aware of the 
seriousness of the issue with Google’s very 
public outing of Operation Aurora.
Application Stores
Year: 2014
Concept: Attempts to provide application 
verification, such as code signing, are not 
new; however, “app stores,” made popular 
by the iPhone, are the accepted medium 
through which to install applications 
on many mobile devices. Application 
repositories will become the default method 
of choosing and installing applications for 
all automation needs to the home and the 
business, effectively creating application 
whitelisting services for the general 
population.
Impact: The enterprise will have a trusted 
source to ensure that no malicious software 
is on an employee’s desktop or laptop.
Enterprise Change: The importance of 
anti-virus technology will diminish.
Early Adopters: No
What has changed this year: There 
are more than 103 applications stores in 
existence today.9

• Provide multiple versions of Windows—one that allows untrusted code 
to execute and one that does not. Enterprises and users who do not 
require the freedom to run any application they like should use the 
trusted-only version. It is important that the trusted-only version does 
not allow an attacker to easily subvert the requirements via either 
technical or non-technical (social engineering) means. 
• Create a process and the necessary technology that allows for the 
vetting and creation of app stores. Microsoft cannot be the sole 
maintainer of app store control; it must transfer its authority to 
other entities in the same way that trusted root certificates built into 
Windows must allow others to use secure socket layer (SSL) sessions 
on the Internet. It is unlikely that Adobe would provide its source code 
to Microsoft for review and distribution through a Microsoft app store, 
but Microsoft could allow code from an Adobe app store to execute 
on Windows through a chain of trust.
The app store model could work differently for home and enterprise users. 
Home users may get their applications directly from app stores that passed 
Microsoft’s vetting process. Microsoft would add vetted app stores’ signing 
certificates to the list of approved-to-run programs on Windows (see Exhibit 
2-2, left). If those app stores began distributing malware, Microsoft could 
prevent any programs signed by that store after a particular date from running. 
Additionally, the app store could also revoke the certificate of a particular 
application if it deemed that application malicious.
In a corporate environment, the information technology (IT) department would 
act as a gateway between app stores and users (see Exhibit 2-2, right). The 
gateway would also allow the IT department to control which applications 
users install and to keep accurate data on precise software versions that 
systems in the network are running.
Within the next 5-10 years, it is possible that Microsoft will enable the 
development of desktop app stores that create a more secure computing 
Windows environment. The primary hurdles preventing this model from 
succeeding on Windows are not technological but political, as this model 
restricts freedom in a way that software developers would almost certainly 
challenge. If Microsoft can implement this model in a way that is acceptable 
to third-party developers and users, it could have a major impact on computer 
security as a whole.
