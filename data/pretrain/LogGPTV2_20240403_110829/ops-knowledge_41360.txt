Configure Remote Desktop: Click the "Advanced" button, select the "Settings" window, and configure authorization options and other advanced settings for remote desktop connections. 4. Configure SSL certificate: Install an SSL certificate and configure SSL encrypted communication using Remote Desktop Gateway. 5. Add User: Configure authentication for remote access to an existing user on your computer. You can run lusrmgr.msc as an administrator, open the user management window, click the "Users" folder to display the user list, right-click the user, click "Properties" to edit the user's properties, select "Remote " tab, enable the "Allow remote access to this computer" option. 6.
