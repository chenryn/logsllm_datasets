titleblackhat:us-19 Playing Offense and Defense with Deepfakes
This presentation seeks to demonstrate how deepfaking can be leveraged for offensive and defensive purposes. Specifically, deepfake internals are presented including a fine grained, step-by-step breakdown of creation, including the details of all deep learning models used in the process. A test deepfake video is created. A malicious deepfake video is then created, in which an international politician is impersonated. This video is then temporarily circulated in the wild, as a means for measuring impact. The offense section of the presentation is followed by a defense section. This section provides an overview of contemporary techniques for detecting deepfake videos. A novel approach to detecting deepfake videos is then introduced. Finally, a tool for offensive and defensive research, known as deepstar, is announced and released at the time of the presentation.
