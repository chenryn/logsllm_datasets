**Title: Playing Offense and Defense with Deepfakes in the US-19 Black Hat Session**

This presentation aims to explore the dual application of deepfake technology for both offensive and defensive purposes. The session will delve into the technical intricacies of deepfake creation, providing a detailed, step-by-step breakdown of the process, including an in-depth look at the deep learning models utilized.

To illustrate these concepts, we will create two types of deepfake videos:
1. **Test Deepfake Video:** A non-malicious video to demonstrate the creation process.
2. **Malicious Deepfake Video:** A video impersonating an international politician, which will be temporarily circulated to measure its potential impact.

Following the offensive segment, the presentation will shift focus to defense. We will provide an overview of current techniques for detecting deepfake videos and introduce a novel approach to detection. 

Finally, we will announce and release a new tool, called "DeepStar," designed to support both offensive and defensive research in the field of deepfakes. This tool will be made available to the audience at the time of the presentation.
