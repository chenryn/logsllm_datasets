Question: You are tasked with designing a network communication system that ensures reliability and security in message transmissions. Given the limitations of the lower layers of the internet, such as the lack of connection concepts and only best-effort delivery by IP without error handling, which of the following layers or protocols would you integrate into your design to achieve the desired reliability and security? Select all that apply.
"A": "Transport Layer with TCP to establish reliable connections and manage packet order and retransmissions.",
"B": "Data Link Layer with MAC addresses to ensure secure and direct device-to-device communication.",
"C": "Application Layer with TLS to provide cryptographic protocols for secure data transmission.",
"D": "Network Layer with routers implementing Quality of Service (QoS) to prioritize certain types of traffic."
Answer: AC
