Question: An adversary has gained initial access to a corporate network and is looking to enumerate valid accounts to facilitate further attacks such as privilege escalation and lateral movement. Which of the following actions would the adversary most likely take to perform account discovery, and which mitigation could an organization implement to impede this activity?
"A": "The adversary may use built-in PowerShell commands to list user accounts, and the organization can prevent enumeration of administrator accounts during UAC elevation by configuring a specific registry key.",
"B": "The adversary might attempt to discover accounts by physically inspecting network hardware, and the organization can mitigate this by implementing 24/7 surveillance of server rooms.",
"C": "The adversary could rely on social engineering to deceive employees into revealing account details, and the organization can counter this by implementing strict email content filtering.",
"D": "The adversary may exploit software vulnerabilities to bypass authentication mechanisms, and the organization can mitigate by deploying antivirus software on all endpoints."
