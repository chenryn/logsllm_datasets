dspmqrte
Queue manager connection
Use this page to specify the queue manager that the IBM MQ display route application connects to
-c
Specifies that the IBM MQ display route application connects as a client application.
If you do not specify this parameter, the IBM MQ display route application does not connect as a client
application.
-m QMgrName
The name of the queue manager to which the IBM MQ display route application connects. The name
can contain up to 48 characters.
If you do not specify this parameter, the default queue manager is used.
80 Monitoring and Performance for IBM MQ
The target destination
Use this page to specify the target destination of a trace-route message
-q TargetQName
If the IBM MQ display route application is being used to send a trace-route message into a queue
manager network, TargetQName specifies the name of the target queue.
-ts TargetTopicString
Specifies the topic string.
-qm TargetQMgr
Qualifies the target destination; normal queue manager name resolution will then apply. The target
destination is specified with -q TargetQName or -ts TargetTopicString .
If you do not specify this parameter, the queue manager to which the IBM MQ display route
application is connected is used as the target queue manager.
-o
Specifies that the target destination is not bound to a specific destination. Typically this parameter is
used when the trace-route message is to be put across a cluster. The target destination is opened with
option MQOO_BIND_NOT_FIXED.
If you do not specify this parameter, the target destination is bound to a specific destination.
The publication topic
For publish/subscribe applications, use this page to specify the topic string of a trace-route message for
the IBM MQ display route application to publish
-ts TopicName
Specifies a topic string to which the IBM MQ display route application is to publish a trace-route
message, and puts this application into topic mode. In this mode, the application traces all of the
messages that result from the publish request.
You can also use the IBM MQ display route application to display the results from an activity report that
was generated for publish messages.
Message mimicking
Use this page to configure a trace-route message to mimic a message, for example when the original
message did not reach its intended destination
One use of trace-route messaging is to help determine the last known location of a message that did not
reach its intended destination. The IBM MQ display route application provides parameters that can help
configure a trace-route message to mimic the original message. When mimicking a message, you can use
the following parameters:
-l Persistence
Specifies the persistence of the generated trace-route message. Possible values for Persistence are:
yes
The generated trace-route message is persistent. (MQPER_PERSISTENT).
no
The generated trace-route message is not persistent. (MQPER_NOT_PERSISTENT).
q
The generated trace-route message inherits its persistence value from the destination specified
by -q TargetQName or -ts TargetTopicString. (MQPER_PERSISTENCE_AS_Q_DEF).
A trace-route reply message, or any report messages, returned will share the same persistence value
as the original trace-route message.
If Persistence is specified as yes, you must specify the parameter -rq ReplyToQ. The reply-to queue
must not resolve to a temporary dynamic queue.
If you do not specify this parameter, the generated trace-route message is not persistent.
IBM MQ Monitoring and performance 81
-p Priority
Specifies the priority of the trace-route message. The value of Priority is either greater than or equal
to 0, or MQPRI_PRIORITY_AS_Q_DEF. MQPRI_PRIORITY_AS_Q_DEF specifies that the priority value
is taken from the destination specified by -q TargetQName or -ts TargetTopicString.
If you do not specify this parameter, the priority value is taken from the destination specified by -q
TargetQName or -ts TargetTopicString.
-xs Expiry
Specifies the expiry time for the trace-route message, in seconds.
If you do not specify this parameter, the expiry time is specified as 60 seconds.
-ro none |ReportOption
none
Specifies no report options are set.
ReportOption
Specifies report options for the trace-route message. Multiple report options can be specified
using a comma as a separator. Possible values for ReportOption are:
activity
The report option MQRO_ACTIVITY is set.
coa
The report option MQRO_COA_WITH_FULL_DATA is set.
cod
The report option MQRO_COD_WITH_FULL_DATA is set.
exception
The report option MQRO_EXCEPTION_WITH_FULL_DATA is set.
expiration
The report option MQRO_EXPIRATION_WITH_FULL_DATA is set.
discard
The report option MQRO_DISCARD_MSG is set.
If neither -ro ReportOption nor -ro none are specified, then the MQRO_ACTIVITY and
MQRO_DISCARD_MSG report options are specified.
The IBM MQ display route application does not allow you to add user data to the trace-route message. If
you require user data to be added to the trace-route message you must generate the trace-route message
manually.
Recorded activity information
Use this page to specify the method used to return recorded activity information, which you can then use
to determine the route that a trace-route message has taken
Recorded activity information can be returned as follows:
• In activity reports
• In a trace-route reply message
• In the trace-route message itself (having been put on the target queue)
When using dspmqrte, the method used to return recorded activity information is determined using the
following parameters:
-ro activity
Specifies that activity information is returned using activity reports. By default activity recording is
enabled.
-ac -ar
Specifies that activity information is accumulated in the trace-route message, and that a trace-route
reply message is to be generated.
82 Monitoring and Performance for IBM MQ
-ac
Specifies that activity information is to be accumulated within the trace-route message.
If you do not specify this parameter, activity information is not accumulated within the trace-route
message.
-ar
Requests that a trace-route reply message containing all accumulated activity information is
generated in the following circumstances:
• The trace-route message is discarded by an IBM MQ queue manager.
• The trace-route message is put to a local queue (target queue or dead-letter queue) by an IBM
MQ queue manager.
• The number of activities performed on the trace-route message exceeds the value of specified in
-s Activities.
-ac -d yes
Specifies that activity information is accumulated in the trace-route message, and that on arrival, the
trace-route message will be put on the target queue.
-ac
Specifies that activity information is to be accumulated within the trace-route message.
If you do not specify this parameter, activity information is not accumulated within the trace-route
message.
-d yes
On arrival, the trace-route message is put to the target queue, even if the queue manager does not
support trace-route messaging.
If you do not specify this parameter, the trace-route message is not put to the target queue.
The trace-route message can then be retrieved from the target queue, and the recorded activity
information acquired.
You can combine these methods as required.
Additionally, the detail level of the recorded activity information can be specified using the following
parameter:
-t Detail
Specifies the activities that are recorded. The possible values for Detail are:
low
Activities performed by user-defined application are recorded only.
medium
Activities specified in low are recorded. Additionally, publish activities and activities performed by
MCAs are recorded.
high
Activities specified in low, and medium are recorded. MCAs do not expose any further activity
information at this level of detail. This option is available to user-defined applications that are to
expose further activity information only. For example, if a user-defined application determines the
route a message takes by considering certain message characteristics, the routing logic could be
included with this level of detail.
If you do not specify this parameter, medium level activities are recorded.
By default the IBM MQ display route application uses a temporary dynamic queue to store the returned
messages. When the IBM MQ display route application ends, the temporary dynamic queue is closed,
and any messages are purged. If the returned messages are required beyond the current execution of the
IBM MQ display route application ends, then a permanent queue must be specified using the following
parameters:
IBM MQ Monitoring and performance 83
-rq ReplyToQ
Specifies the name of the reply-to queue that all responses to the trace-route message are sent to.
If the trace-route message is persistent, or if the -n parameter is specified, a reply-to queue must be
specified that is not a temporary dynamic queue.
If you do not specify this parameter then a dynamic reply-to queue is created using the system default
model queue, SYSTEM.DEFAULT.MODEL.QUEUE.
-rqm ReplyToQMgr
Specifies the name of the queue manager where the reply-to queue resides. The name can contain up
to 48 characters.
If you do not specify this parameter, the queue manager to which the IBM MQ display route
application is connected is used as the reply-to queue manager.
How the trace-route message is handled
Use this page to control how a trace-route message is handled as it is routed through a queue manager
network.
The following parameters can restrict where the trace-route message can be routed in the queue
manager network:
-d Deliver
Specifies whether the trace-route message is to be delivered to the target queue on arrival. Possible
values for Deliver are:
yes
On arrival, the trace-route message is put to the target queue, even if the queue manager does not
support trace-route messaging.
no
On arrival, the trace-route message is not put to the target queue.
If you do not specify this parameter, the trace-route message is not put to the target queue.
-f Forward
Specifies the type of queue manager that the trace-route message can be forwarded to. For details
of the algorithm that queue managers use to determine whether to forward a message to a remote
queue manager, refer to “The TraceRoute PCF group” on page 72. The possible values for Forward are:
all
The trace-route message is forwarded to any queue manager.
Warning: If forwarded to a queue manager earlier than IBM WebSphere MQ 6.0, the trace-route
message will not be recognized and can be delivered to a local queue despite the value of the -d
Deliver parameter.
supported
The trace-route message is only forwarded to a queue manager that will honor the Deliver
parameter from the TraceRoute PCF group
If you do not specify this parameter, the trace-route message will only be forwarded to a queue
manager that will honor the Deliver parameter.
The following parameters can prevent a trace-route message from remaining in a queue manager network
indefinitely:
-s Activities
Specifies the maximum number of recorded activities that can be performed on behalf of the trace-
route message before it is discarded. This prevents the trace-route message from being forwarded
indefinitely if caught in an infinite loop. The value of Activities is either greater than or equal to 1, or
MQROUTE_UNLIMITED_ACTIVITIES. MQROUTE_UNLIMITED_ACTIVITIES specifies that an unlimited
number of activities can be performed on behalf of the trace-route message.
If you do not specify this parameter, an unlimited number of activities can be performed on behalf of
the trace-route message.
84 Monitoring and Performance for IBM MQ
-xs Expiry
Specifies the expiry time for the trace-route message, in seconds.
If you do not specify this parameter, the expiry time is specified as 60 seconds.
-xp PassExpiry
Specifies whether the expiry time from the trace-route message is passed on to a trace-route reply
message. Possible values for PassExpiry are:
yes
The report option MQRO_PASS_DISCARD_AND_EXPIRY is specified in the message descriptor of
the trace-route message.
If a trace-route reply message, or activity reports, are generated for the trace-route message, the
MQRO_DISCARD report option (if specified), and the remaining expiry time are passed on.
This is the default value.
no
The report option MQRO_PASS_DISCARD_AND_EXPIRY is not specified.
If a trace-route reply message is generated for the trace-route message, the discard option and
expiry time from the trace-route message are not passed on.
If you do not specify this parameter, MQRO_PASS_DISCARD_AND_EXPIRY is not specified.
-ro discard
Specifies the MQRO_DISCARD_MSG report option. This can prevent the trace-route message
remaining in the queue manager network indefinitely.
Display of activity information
The IBM MQ display route application can display activity information for a trace-route message that
it has just put into a queue manager network, or it can display activity information for a previously
generated trace-route message. It can also display additional information recorded by user-written
applications.
To specify whether activity information returned for a trace-route message is displayed, specify the
following parameter:
-n
Specifies that activity information returned for the trace-route message is not to be displayed.
If this parameter is accompanied by a request for a trace-route reply message, ( -ar ), or any of the
report generating options from ( -ro ReportOption ), then a specific (non-model) reply-to queue
must be specified using -rq ReplyToQ . By default, only activity report messages are requested.
After the trace-route message is put to the specified target queue, a 48 character hexadecimal string
is displayed containing the message identifier of the trace-route message. The message identifier can
be used by the IBM MQ display route application to display the activity information for the trace-route
message at a later time, using the -i CorrelId parameter.
If you do not specify this parameter, activity information returned for the trace-route message is
displayed in the form specified by the -v parameter.
When displaying activity information for a trace-route message that has just been put into a queue
manager network, the following parameter can be specified:
-w WaitTime
Specifies the time, in seconds, that the IBM MQ display route application will wait for activity reports,
or a trace-route reply message, to return to the specified reply-to queue.
If you do not specify this parameter, the wait time is specified as the expiry time of the trace-route
message, plus 60 seconds.
When displaying previously accumulated activity information the following parameters must be set:
IBM MQ Monitoring and performance 85
-q TargetQName
If the IBM MQ display route application is being used to view previously gathered activity information,
TargetQName specifies the name of the queue where the activity information is stored.
-i CorrelId
This parameter is used when the IBM MQ display route application is used to display previously
accumulated activity information only. There can be many activity reports and trace-route reply
messages on the queue specified by -q TargetQName. CorrelId is used to identify the activity reports,
or a trace-route reply message, related to a trace-route message. Specify the message identifier of the
original trace-route message in CorrelId.
The format of CorrelId is a 48 character hexadecimal string.
The following parameters can be used when displaying previously accumulated activity information, or
when displaying current activity information for a trace-route message:
-b
Specifies that the IBM MQ display route application will only browse activity reports or a trace-route
reply message related to a message. This allows activity information to be displayed again at a later
time.
If you do not specify this parameter, the IBM MQ display route application will destructively get
activity reports or a trace-route reply message related to a message.
-v summary | all | none | outline DisplayOption
summary
The queues that the trace-route message was routed through are displayed.
all
All available information is displayed.
none
No information is displayed.
outline DisplayOption
Specifies display options for the trace-route message. Multiple display options can be specified
using a comma as a separator.
If no values are supplied the following is displayed:
• The application name
• The type of each operation
• Any operation specific parameters
Possible values for DisplayOption are:
activity
All non-PCF group parameters in Activity PCF groups are displayed.
identifiers
Values with parameter identifiers MQBACF_MSG_ID or MQBACF_CORREL_ID are displayed.
This overrides msgdelta.
message
All non-PCF group parameters in Message PCF groups are displayed. When this value is
specified, you cannot specify msgdelta.
msgdelta
All non-PCF group parameters in Message PCF groups, that have changed since the last
operation, are displayed. When this value is specified, you cannot specify message.
operation
All non-PCF group parameters in Operation PCF groups are displayed.
traceroute
All non-PCF group parameters in TraceRoute PCF groups are displayed.
If you do not specify this parameter, a summary of the message route is displayed.
86 Monitoring and Performance for IBM MQ
Display of additional information
As a trace-route message is routed through a queue manager network, user-written applications can
record additional information by writing one or more additional PCF parameters to the message data
of the trace-route message or to the message data of an activity report. For the IBM MQ display route
application to display additional information in a readable form it must be recorded in a specific format, as
described in “Additional activity information” on page 77.
IBM MQ display route application examples
The following examples show how you can use the IBM MQ display route application. In each
example, two queue managers (QM1 and QM2) are inter-connected by two channels (QM2.TO.QM1 and
QM1.TO.QM2).
Example 1 - Requesting activity reports
Display activity information from a trace-route message delivered to the target queue
In this example the IBM MQ display route application connects to queue manager, QM1, and is used to
generate and deliver a trace-route message to the target queue, TARGET.Q, on remote queue manager,
QM2. The necessary report option is specified so that activity reports are requested as the trace-route
reply message is routed. On arrival at the target queue the trace-route message is discarded. Activity
information returned to the IBM MQ display route application using activity reports is put in order and
displayed.
Figure 9. Requesting activity reports, Diagram 1
• The ACTIVREC attribute of each queue manager (QM1 and QM2) is set to MSG.
• The following command is issued:
dspmqrte -m QM1 -q TARG.AT.QM2 -rq ACTIV.REPLY.Q
QM1 is the name of the queue manager to which the IBM MQ display route application connects,
TARG.AT.QM2 is the name of the target queue, and ACTIV.REPLY.Q is the name of the queue to which it
is requested that all responses to the trace-route message are sent.
Default values are assumed for all options that are not specified, but note in particular the -f option
(the trace-route message is forwarded only to a queue manager that honors the Deliver parameter of
the TraceRoute PCF group), the -d option (on arrival, the trace-route message is not put on the target
queue), the -ro option (MQRO_ACTIVITY and MQRO_DISCARD_MSG report options are specified), and
the -t option (medium detail level activity is recorded).
IBM MQ Monitoring and performance 87
• DSPMQRTE generates the trace-route message and puts it on the remote queue TARG.AT.QM2.
• DSPMQRTE then looks at the value of the ACTIVREC attribute of queue manager QM1. The value is MSG,
therefore DSPMQRTE generates an activity report and puts it on the reply queue ACTIV.REPLY.Q.
Figure 10. Requesting activity reports, Diagram 2
• The sending message channel agent (MCA) gets the trace-route message from the transmission queue.
The message is a trace-route message, therefore the MCA begins to record the activity information.
• The ACTIVREC attribute of the queue manager (QM1) is MSG, and the MQRO_ACTIVITY option is
specified in the Report field of the message descriptor, therefore the MCA will later generate an activity
report. The RecordedActivities parameter value in the TraceRoute PCF group is incremented by 1.
• The MCA checks that the MaxActivities value in the TraceRoute PCF group has not been exceeded.
• Before the message is forwarded to QM2 the MCA follows the algorithm that is described in Forwarding
(steps “1” on page 74, “4” on page 74, and “5” on page 75 ) and the MCA chooses to send the message.
• The MCA then generates an activity report and puts it on the reply queue (ACTIV.REPLY.Q).
88 Monitoring and Performance for IBM MQ
Figure 11. Requesting activity reports, Diagram 3
• The receiving MCA receives the trace-route message from the channel. The message is a trace-route
message, therefore the MCA begins to record the information about the activity.
• If the queue manager that the trace-route message has come from is IBM WebSphere MQ 5.3.1 or
