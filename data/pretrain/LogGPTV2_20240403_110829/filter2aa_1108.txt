#### Technical Setup
Robert is a passionate technology enthusiast, actively involved in the DefCon community. He hosts several websites from his home, including:
- Personal Homepage: http://www.hackajar.com

- Saturn Enthusiasts Site: http://www.saturnclubs.com
- EverQuest Guild Sites: http://www.guardianlords.com, http://www.abandonguild.com (currently inactive)

His home setup resembles a small data center, featuring:
- 2 cable modem uplinks
- 1 Wireless ISP uplink
- 2 network switches
- 802.11b "Hot Spot Ready" Wi-Fi with WEP
- 2 DNS servers
- 1 BSD-based firewall
- 2 Apache web servers (one for pre-production and storage)
- 1 test bed BSD server
- 1 primary workstation
- 1 Sun Ultra 5
- 1 IBM PS/2 Model 80 (386) still in use
- 3 additional computers awaiting hard drive upgrades

The entire setup is supported by three 50-amp circuit breakers and multiple uninterruptible power supplies (UPS) to ensure continuous operation. While maintaining this extensive equipment may not have a practical purpose, it remains a rewarding and expensive hobby for Robert.
