Personal Sound Byte -
Living in Las Vegas, NV, USA Robert enjoys exploring sin city and every little sin it has to offer.  On 
a sane level he also enjoys hiking at Red Rock Canyon, political talks at local coffee shops, and 
spending as much time as he can with his 4 year old son, Orion.
Computer Sound Byte - 
Robert tends to be as much a freak about computers as the next guy, well, at DefCon anyway.  He 
currently hosts would be dot com sites from his bedroom, about 6 .com pages, including 
His home page - http//www.hackajar.com 
His Consulting firm site - http//www.shebangsoft.org
Dormant Saturn Enthusiasts site - http//www.saturnclubs.com
Friends Ever Quest guild site - http//www.guardianlords.com / http//www.abandonguild.com 
(ironically abandoned!)

2 Switches
1 802.11b "Hot Spot Ready" Wi-Fi WEP
2 DNS servers

2 Apache servers (1 used as pre-production and storage)
1 Test bed BSD box
1 "Primary" computer (the grocery getter')
1 Sun Ultra 5
1 IBM PS/2 Model 80 386 ALIVE AND KICKIN!!!

Now it may be true that he has no 'real' reason for running all this gear, it's still an expensive hobby 
he enjoys mantaining (your still a freak).
