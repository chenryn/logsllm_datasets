User: You have been asked to perform a security check on a new server. Please provide a checklist and describe each item in the checklist.
Assistant: The following is a new server security checklist: 1. System updates: Verify that the server operating system, software packages, and applications have the latest security patches installed. 2. Network security configuration: Make sure that the server's built-in firewall and security group rules are correctly configured and effective, and limit unnecessary network connections. 3. Accounts and permissions: Audit accounts and permissions on the server, do not run applications as root or other powerful accounts, and limit user access to servers and applications. 4. Antivirus software: Install and configure virus scanning software to ensure it is up to date and can detect and remove malware in a timely manner. 5. Monitoring and auditing: Set monitoring and auditing rules, set up log tracking and archiving mechanisms, which can detect and respond to abnormal behaviors in a timely manner. 6. Hardware Security: Ensure that the server is complete, secure and easy to access, and set a hardware-level password/key for the server. 7. Data Backup: Make sure that an appropriate backup strategy is in place and back up the server's data and system state. 8. Password policy: Set a strong password policy for servers and applications to ensure that all passwords are encrypted and invisible, and passwords should be changed regularly. 9. Security audit: Regularly conduct security audits and vulnerability scans to prevent potential security threats. 10. Emergency response: establish a complete and standardized emergency response and recovery plan, respond to security incidents in a timely manner and implement corresponding measures.
