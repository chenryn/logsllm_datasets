User: I'm using Bottle as my webservice. Currently, its running on bottle's default wsgi server and handles HTTP requests. I want to encrypt my webservice and handle HTTPS requests. Can someone suggest a method for this. I tried running on cherrypy server, but the latest version is not supporting the pyOpenSSLAdapter.
Assistant: You need to put your WSGI server (not WsgiRef certainly) behind a reverse-proxy with https support. Nginx is the most common choice.
