User: I am building a deb package from source. The source used to install the modules in 'site-packages' in RHEL.
On Ubuntu, 'site-packages' doesn't work for me. Searching over the net, it says that python Ubuntu would require it in 'dist-packages'
But there are also references that python built from source would look in 'site-packages'
Now I am confused, where should my deb packages install the modules so that it works irrespective of python built from source or installed from Ubuntu repo
Assistant: From what I learnt from IRC is that I should install the modules in 'dist-packages' only, assuming that the admin would have installed the python provided by Ubuntu repo only.
