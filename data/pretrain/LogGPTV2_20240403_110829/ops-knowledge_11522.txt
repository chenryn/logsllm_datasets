When building a Debian (`.deb`) package from source, it's important to ensure that the Python modules are installed in the correct directory, so they work seamlessly whether Python is installed from the Ubuntu repositories or built from source.

### Key Points:
1. **RHEL and `site-packages`**: On RHEL, Python modules are typically installed in the `site-packages` directory.
2. **Ubuntu and `dist-packages`**: On Ubuntu, the default location for Python modules is `dist-packages`.
3. **Python Built from Source**: When Python is built from source, it generally uses the `site-packages` directory.

### Recommended Approach:
To ensure compatibility and avoid confusion, you should install your Python modules in the `dist-packages` directory when creating your `.deb` package. This approach is based on the assumption that most users will be using the Python version provided by the Ubuntu repositories.

### Steps to Follow:
1. **Modify the `setup.py` or Build Script**:
   - Ensure that your build script or `setup.py` installs the modules into `dist-packages` by default. You can do this by setting the appropriate `--install-lib` option or by modifying the `data_files` or `package_data` settings in `setup.py`.

2. **Debian Control File (`debian/control`)**:
   - In your `debian/control` file, specify the dependencies on the Python packages provided by the Ubuntu repositories. This ensures that the system Python is used.

3. **Post-Installation Script (`debian/postinst`)**:
   - If necessary, you can create a post-installation script (`debian/postinst`) to handle any additional setup or symlinking to ensure that the modules are accessible in both `dist-packages` and `site-packages`.

### Example `setup.py` Modification:
```python
from setuptools import setup, find_packages

setup(
    name='your-package',
    version='1.0.0',
    packages=find_packages(),
    data_files=[('/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages', ['path/to/your/module.py'])],
    # Other setup configurations
)
```

### Example `debian/control` File:
```plaintext
Source: your-package
Section: python
Priority: optional
Maintainer: Your Name <your.email@example.com>
Build-Depends: debhelper (>= 9), python3-all (>= 3.6~)
Standards-Version: 4.1.3
Homepage: https://example.com/your-package

Package: python3-your-package
Architecture: all
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, ${python3:Depends}
Description: A short description of your package
```

### Summary:
By installing your Python modules in the `dist-packages` directory, you ensure that they are compatible with the Python version provided by the Ubuntu repositories. This approach minimizes the risk of conflicts and ensures that your package works as expected for the majority of users. If you need to support users who have built Python from source, you may need to provide additional documentation or scripts to handle such cases.
