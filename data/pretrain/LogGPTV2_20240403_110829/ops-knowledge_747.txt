User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题httpd won't start on boot I have some problemes with apache on CENTOS...

When I reboot the system, httpd won't start

I have to execut my-self "service httpd start"

chkconfig  httpd --list
httpd           0:off   1:off   2:on    3:on    4:on    5:on    6:off


Any ideas ? 

Thank you!

Assistant: Open a terminal window an enter the following:

/etc/init.d/httpd start


This will start apache

then

tail /var/log/httpd/error_log


This will give you the last 10 entries in the apache log. There, you should find the error. Get it and paste it here.
