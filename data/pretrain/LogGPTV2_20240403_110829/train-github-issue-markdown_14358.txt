We know that ImageDataGenerator provides a way for image data augmentation:
`ImageDataGenerator.flow(X, Y)`. Now consider the image segmentation task
where `Y` is not a categorical label but a image mask which is the same size
as input `X`, e.g. 256x256 pixels. If we would like to use data augmentation,
the same transformation should also be adopted to `Y`. Is there any simple way
to handle this?
