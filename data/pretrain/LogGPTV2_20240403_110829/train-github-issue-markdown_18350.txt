# Http Request Solutions
We are going to export dubbo service for front-end request(eg: h5 outside). We
are doubt about the advantage and disadvantage of below two solutions, anyone
have good ideas for that?
Generally, there are two ways to support that.  
Solution1: Add proxy(through GenericService) for the http request (http ->
proxy -> dubbo)  
Solution2: Support dubbo & http protocol in service side (eg: dubbox/jsonrpc).
## For Solution1:
### Advantage:
  1. It's easy for the user, no need to maintain both http & dubbo protocols.
  2. No need to maintain two types of configurations (one for dubbo, another for http). Following two conditions may confuse the user. Firstly, xxx config support for dubbo and http, but they are in different key. Secondly, yyy config is supported in dubbo, not for http. User maybe confused on so much of the configs.
### Disadvantage:
  1. The latency is high for the proxy mode.  
For dubbo protocol: 1k request/100k response/3000QPS, average response is
1-2ms, and able to support 7000-8000QPS in 8Core server.  
For the proxy mode: 1K request/100K response/600QPS, the average response is
14ms, only with 600QPS.
  2. The proxy CPU is very high.  
For dubbo protocol: With 7000-8000QPS, the service CPU is about 80-90%, with
600QPS, the service CPU below 5-10% maybe.  
For proxy mode: With 600QPS, service CPU is low, but the proxy's CPU is almost
full (80-90%). That means, it need 4-5times of the server to host the request.
## For Solution2:
### Advantage:
  1. The latency is very low, as it's directly connect to the service.
### Disadvantage:
  1. User have to maintain both dubbo & http protocol, as described in solution 1 .
We are confused to find a better solution. Am i in a wrong way, or anyone have
good suggestions or solutions for http request?
Thanks for any suggestions.
