### Issue Verification
- I have thoroughly searched the repository's issues and FAQs to ensure that this is not a duplicate.

### Environment
- **Dubbo Version:** xxx
- **Operating System Version:** xxx
- **Java Version:** xxx

### HTTP Request Solutions
We are planning to export Dubbo services for frontend requests (e.g., H5 applications). We are considering two potential solutions and would appreciate insights into their respective advantages and disadvantages.

#### Solution 1: Proxy via GenericService
- **HTTP Request Flow:** HTTP → Proxy → Dubbo

##### Advantages:
1. **Simplified User Experience:** Users do not need to manage both HTTP and Dubbo protocols.
2. **Unified Configuration:** There is no need to maintain separate configurations for Dubbo and HTTP, which can be confusing. For example, different keys for similar configurations or certain settings being supported only in one protocol but not the other.

##### Disadvantages:
1. **Increased Latency:**
   - **Dubbo Protocol Performance:**
     - 1k requests / 100k responses / 3000 QPS
     - Average response time: 1-2 ms
     - Supports 7000-8000 QPS on an 8-core server
   - **Proxy Mode Performance:**
     - 1k requests / 100k responses / 600 QPS
     - Average response time: 14 ms
     - Only supports 600 QPS
2. **High CPU Usage:**
   - **Dubbo Protocol:**
     - At 7000-8000 QPS, service CPU usage is around 80-90%
     - At 600 QPS, service CPU usage is below 5-10%
   - **Proxy Mode:**
     - At 600 QPS, the service CPU usage is low, but the proxy's CPU usage is nearly full (80-90%)
     - This implies that 4-5 times more servers may be required to handle the same load.

#### Solution 2: Support Both Dubbo and HTTP Protocols
- **Example Implementations:** Dubbox, JSON-RPC

##### Advantages:
1. **Low Latency:** Direct connection to the service results in minimal latency.

##### Disadvantages:
1. **Dual Protocol Management:** Users must maintain both Dubbo and HTTP protocols, as discussed in Solution 1.

### Conclusion
We are seeking advice on the best approach for handling HTTP requests with Dubbo. Are we overlooking any important considerations, or does anyone have additional suggestions or solutions?

Thank you for your input.
