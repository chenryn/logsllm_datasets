### Ensemble Model with Majority Voting

The following base models are used in a majority voting scheme:

| Predictor Type | Parameters |
|----------------|------------|
| **Similarity-based** | P1: 45 days training, minimum cluster size: 40, distance threshold: 0.80, distribution spread: 0.006, blacklist incompleteness: 80% |
| **Reputation-based** | P2: 15 days training, distribution spread: 20, blacklist incompleteness: 60% |
| **Reputation-based** | P3: 60 days training, distribution spread: 20, blacklist incompleteness: 60% |

**Table 2: Majority Voting Ensemble with the Highest F1 Score**

It is important to note that the selection of the most appropriate predictor model depends on the specific business use case and involves a trade-off between precision and recall. For some use cases, such as preemptive blocking of domain registrations, high precision (and a low false-positive rate) is essential. For other use cases, such as proactive monitoring, a higher recall may be more suitable. To make these selections, different F-scores (e.g., F0.5 or F2) can be used to emphasize either precision or recall.

### Testing the Ensemble Model

We evaluate the ensemble model from two perspectives: using blacklist data and campaign knowledge.

#### Ground Truth-Based Evaluation

To assess the performance of the selected ensemble model on unseen data, we run the daily retrained model over an 11-month testing phase and compare its predictions with the ground truth labels.

- **Recall**: 66.23%
- **Precision**: 84.57%
- **False Positive Rate**: 0.30%

#### Campaign-Based Evaluation

In addition to evaluating the predictions against the ground truth, we also assess how well the ensemble model predicts long-running campaigns. We compare the model's prediction results with the post-factum manual campaign analysis by Vissers et al. [22] over the same set of domain registrations.

- **Overall Recall**: 76.68%
- **Precision**: 87.20%

Out of the 20 campaigns, 17 were well-predicted. The three campaigns that were more challenging for Premadoma to predict were c_05, c_12, and c_15, which employed evasion patterns described in Section 7.1.

- **Campaign c_05**: A small campaign with a blacklist coverage below 60%. Registrants use WHOIS privacy protection to hide details, violating the registry's terms and conditions, leading to immediate suspension.
- **Campaign c_15**: An advanced campaign with 98 different registrant contacts, varying daily, and only 27% of the domains being flagged by blacklist services.
- **Campaign c_12**: Composed of 29 different registrants, each used on at most 2 distinct days.

### Real-World Deployment

This section details the deployment of Premadoma in a production environment at the registry, including operational challenges and results.

#### Phases of the Deployment

The models proposed in Sections 3 to 5 have been successfully deployed at the registry in several phases.

- **Incremental Development**: In early 2017, the integration into the TLDâ€™s operational infrastructure was prepared and fine-tuned. From mid-2017 onwards, the system processed incoming real-world registrations on a daily basis.
