Table 2: Majority voting ensemble with the highest F1 score
It should be noted that the choice of the most appropriate pre-
dictor model depends on the particular business use case, and is a
trade-off between precision and recall. For some use cases (such
as pre-emptive blocking domain registrations), a high precision
(and low false-positive rate) is indispensable, for other use cases
(proactive monitoring) a higher recall might be more suitable. To
make such selections, other F-scores (e.g. F0.5 or F2) can be used to
put more emphasis on either precision or recall.
5.2 Testing the ensemble model
We evaluate the ensemble model from the perspective of blacklist
data, as well as by using campaign knowledge.
Ground truth-based evaluation. In order to evaluate the perfor-
mance of the selected ensemble model on unseen data, we run the
daily retrained model on the 11-month testing phase and compare
its predictions with the ground truth labels.
In this testing phase, the ensemble model achieves 66.23% recall
at a precision of 84.57% and a false positive rate of 0.30%.
Campaign-based evaluation. In addition to evaluating the pre-
dictions with respect to the ground truth, we evaluate how well
the ensemble model is able to predict long-running campaigns. For
this purpose, we compare the model’s prediction results with the
post-factum manual campaign analysis by Vissers et al. [22] over
the same set of domains registrations.
17 out of the 20 campaigns are well predicted, leading to an
overall recall of 76.68% and a precision of 87.20% with respect to
campaign registrations. The 3 campaigns that were more difficult
for Premadoma to predict were campaigns c_05, c_12 and c_15,
which employ some of the evasion patterns, described in Section 7.1:
Campaign c_05 is a small campaign with a blacklist coverage
below 60%. Moreover, the registrants use a WHOIS privacy
protection service to hide registrant details. This practice
violates terms and conditions of this registry, and as such
already forms a reason for immediate suspension.
Campaign c_15 is a prototypical example of an advanced cam-
paign, as discussed in detail by Vissers et al. [22]: the cam-
paign applies 98 different registrant contacts, typically varies
on a daily basis and only 27% of the domains end up being
flagged by blacklist services.
Campaign c_12 Similarly, campaign c_12 is composed of 29 dif-
ferent registrants, all being used on at most 2 distinct days.

6 REAL-WORLD DEPLOYMENT
In this section, we report on how we placed Premadoma in pro-
duction at the registry, detailing on the operational challenges and
results.
6.1 Phases of the deployment
The models proposed in sections 3 to 5 have been successfully
deployed at the registry in several phases.
Incremental development. Early 2017, the integration in the
TLD’s operational infrastructure was prepared and fine-tuned. From
mid 2017 onwards, the system processed incoming real-world reg-
istrations on a daily basis.
