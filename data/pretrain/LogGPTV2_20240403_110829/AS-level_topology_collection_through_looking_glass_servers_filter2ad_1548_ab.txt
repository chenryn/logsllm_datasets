come from the RIPE RR.
To remove possibly outdated AS links from the IRR dataset,
earlier studies like [7] have relied on changed attribute of an
IRR record, which shows the last updated date of the IRR
record. However, we ﬁnd that RIPE no longer publishes
changed attribute in the IRR records. To remove outdated
AS links from the IRR, we collected the AS topology snap-
shots published by IRL [18] dating back till 2004. We want
to check whether some of the AS links in the IRR were
observed in the historical BGP based AS topologies. Such
comparison conﬁrms that some of the AS links found in the
IRR were operational in BGP but are not currently visible
from BGP. Using the above method, we ﬁnd as many as
46 K (out of 206 K) outdated IRR AS links. We removed
these AS links and have used around 160 K AS links from
the IRR.
4. COMPARISON OF BGP FEEDERS
There are three popular BGP collector projects: Route-
Views [31], RIPE-RIS [32], and PCH [33]. The ASes sharing
their BGP traces to the BGP collector projects are known as
BGP feeders [22]. In this section, we are interested in ﬁnding
out whether, by querying LG servers, we can collect BGP
traces from ASes that are not BGP feeders of RouteViews,
RIPE-RIS, and PCH. Such analysis indicates whether BGP
traces collected from the LG servers help discover new AS
links that are not found in the other AS topology datasets
(e.g., IRL [18]). Moreover, collecting BGP traces from new
BGP feeders help widen our limited view of BGP observed
from current BGP collectors [22].
We have collected information regarding the BGP feeders
(i.e., ASNs and IP addresses of routers) of RouteViews [31],
RIPE-RIS [32], and PCH [33] from their websites in the
month of March 2013. The comparison between the BGP
feeders of diﬀerent projects are based on the ASN and IP
address of BGP routers sharing the BGP traces. That is,
if the ASN and/or IP address of a BGP router matches
between the LG servers and RouteViews BGP feeders, then
it is considered that the same BGP router (of an AS) is
sharing its BGP traces with both RouteViews and the LG
servers.
Table 3 shows the number of common BGP feeders (ASes
and routers) sharing their BGP traces with the RouteViews,
RIPE-RIS, PCH, or LG server datasets. The diagonal (in
bold) is the number of BGP feeders available only in one
dataset; either in RV, RIPE, PCH, or LG servers. We ob-
serve diﬀerences in the number of ASes and router IPs over-
lapping between diﬀerent datasets. For example, 63 neigh-
boring ASes of LG servers are sharing their traces with RV.
However, only 36 router IPs are matched between LG servers
and RV. Further investigation leads us to ﬁnd the following
two reasons for such mismatches: (i) An AS can be peering
on an IPv4 connection with RV while on an IPv6 connection
with LG servers. In that case, when two datasets are com-
pared to check for the overlapping ASNs and router IPs, the
observed router IPs can be diﬀerent in both datasets though
they are with the same ASN. (ii) An AS can be peering with
RV at a diﬀerent location in the Internet from where an LG
server is located, thus the observed router IPs between the
two datasets can be diﬀerent as well, while they have the
same ASNs.
Moreover, we ﬁnd that 545 (out of 1.1 K) neighboring
ASes of the LG servers overlap with RouteViews, RIPE-RIS,
or PCH. More importantly, we observe that 620 neighboring
ASes of the LG routers are not sharing their BGP traces
with RouteViews, RIPE-RIS, nor PCH. We further inspect
the number of routes announced by each neighboring ASes
of LG servers to ﬁnd that 70% (of the 1.1 K) neighboring
ASes of the LG servers announce a small number (1 to 100)
of BGP routes, since most of these ASes are stub ASes. The
remaining (30%) neighbors of LG servers announce BGP
routes in the range of 100 to 450 K. Overall, we were able

to collect 128 BGP routing tables of around 450 K preﬁxes
from the LG servers, which is approximately equal to the
size of full BGP routing table in the current Internet [35].
The analysis presented so far in this section suggests that
there are many ASes who are willing to publicly share their
BGP traces by operating LG servers, which in turn begs
the question that why such ASes have yet to oﬀer feeds to
route collectors. We suggest two possible reasons: (i) In
the past, network operators were motivated to share their
BGP feeds to the route collectors in order to advertise their
rich connectivity and dominance (especially Tier-1’s) in the
Internet [22]. However, they may not need to do that any
more as maintaining an LG server serves that purpose too.
Besides, maintaining an LG server by an AS is helpful for
operational reasons such as troubleshooting routing issues.
(ii) BGP collector projects such as RouteViews have pres-
ence at a limited number of locations in the Internet (e.g.,
large IXPs) and mostly collect traces from ASes present at
those locations (e.g., members of large IXPs). Thus, Route-
Views can not collect traces from the ASes which are not
located at these locations but are sharing their feeds to the
LG servers.
5. ANALYSIS OF AS-LEVEL TOPOLOGIES
In this section, we present the analysis of the AS topology
generated by the LG server datasets in comparison to the
ones from the other datasets.
5.1 Overlapping/Unique AS Links
We compare AS topologies generated from diﬀerent datasets,
to ﬁnd overlapping and unique AS links among them. Such
analysis are important in quantifying how many AS links
are newly discovered from the LG servers. Table 4 indicates
the number of common AS links for each pair of datasets.
The diagonal zone from upper-left to bottom-right (in bold)
reports the count of AS links appearing in only one dataset,
i.e., either in LGs, IRL, IRR, Ark or iPlane only. We ob-
serve 11 K unique AS links in the AS topology from the LG
servers. We ﬁnd 51 K unique AS links in IRL, which suggests
that there are a signiﬁcant number of AS links not observed

covered AS links through LG servers. The number of AS
links found in the IRL (2nd column), the number of newly
discovered AS links from the LG servers (3rd column), and
the corresponding increase in the AS connectivity in per-
centage (4th column).

from the BGP feeders of LG servers. The IRR contains 93 K
unique AS links, some or many of which might have been
outdated. However, as noted earlier in Section 3.2, there is
no clear way of ﬁltering out the outdated information from
the IRR. Finally, Ark and iPlane have their contribution of
unique AS links, while many of these AS links may not be
accurate either, due to the traceroute measurement issues
such as IP-to-AS mapping [15, 16].
To better understand the geographic location of newly
discovered AS links from the LG servers, we use the Team
Cymru WHOIS service [37] to map the ASes in the newly
discovered 11 K AS links to the regional Internet registries
(RIRs). We ﬁnd 6.5 K AS links whose source AS (in an AS
link) is from RIPE, 3.4 K from ARIN, 0.8 K from APNIC,
295 from LACNIC, and 88 from AfriNIC. Considering that
the IRR registration is popular in RIPE [6], it is surprising
to observe that the largest portion (6.5 K out of 11 K) of
newly discovered AS links are from RIPE. That is, there are
still many ASes in the RIPE region who do not correctly
maintain their routing policies in the IRR. Further inspec-
tion reveals that most of these 11 K AS links do not go
beyond their RIR regions. For instance, 80% of the newly
discovered AS links from the the RIPE region have both of
the source and destination ASes in that region.
Finally, we analyze the diﬀerences in the AS connectivity
of all the 4 K source ASes (i.e., every source AS of the 11 K
newly discovered AS links) with respect to the AS connectiv-
ity of the ASes observed in IRL [18], which is known as the
most complete BGP-based AS topology dataset [7]. Table 5
shows, for each of top 10 ASes in terms of the number of
new AS links found from our LG dataset, the number of AS
links found in the IRL (2nd column), the number of newly
discovered AS links from the LG servers (3rd column), and
the corresponding increase in AS connectivity in percentage
(4th column). We found 112 and 109 new AS links for the
Tier-1 ASes Level 3 and Abovenet, respectively, through the
LG servers. We also observe the increase in the AS connec-
tivity of some other large ASes, e.g., 18.9% increase in the
AS connectivity of Google (AS15169).
Why do the LG servers miss AS links observed in
other datasets? While the AS topology collected from LG
servers reports new AS links (11 K), it is missing many AS
links visible in other datasets, e.g., 51 K in the IRL. This
can be due to the following reasons. First, BGP feeders
may provide a full feed to the router collector projects such
as RouteViews while they may share only partial feed to LG
servers due to economic relationships (such as Peer-to-Peer)
with ASes operating the LG servers. Second, LG servers also
suﬀer from vantage point bias. More speciﬁcally, depending
on the view of a BGP feeder and its location in the Internet,
only a speciﬁc part of AS topology can be discovered by an
LG server. Third, it is not clear whether all the AS links
published by the traceroute and IRR datasets are correct.
Why do the other datasets not see AS links dis-
covered using LG servers? The reasons are diﬀerent
depending on diﬀerent AS topology datasets. First, the in-
completeness of BGP-based datasets has been reported in
a few studies [7, 22], which is due to the limited number of
ASes sharing their BGP feeds to RouteViews and RIPE-
RIS. Moreover, AS topology view from BGP-based datasets
is also biased, as current route collector projects have bet-
ter views of the core rather than the other parts of the In-
ternet; Tier-1s more actively share their BGP traces than
other ASes [22]. Second, traceroute-based datasets suﬀer
