User:  How to implement cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)?
Assistant: To implement cross-origin resource sharing (CORS), you need to set a response header on the server side that allows cross-origin access. The following are some common steps: 1. Add the Access-Control-Allow-Origin field in the server response header, which specifies the origin that allows cross-domain requests. If you want to allow access from any source, you can set it to *. 2. Optional fields include Access-Control-Allow-Methods (allowed HTTP methods), Access-Control-Allow-Headers (allowed HTTP header information), etc. 3. If the request contains cookie or HTTP authentication information, the Access-Control-Allow-Credentials field needs to be set to true. 4. If the content returned by the server is in JSON format, you need to set the response header Content-Type to application/json. 5. On the front-end page, you need to use XMLHttpRequest to bring the information required for cross-domain requests. Note: Cross-domain request processing plug-ins need to be installed; cross-domain requests can also be processed in the backend.
