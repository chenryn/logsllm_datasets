Question: "Alice, a web developer, is tasked with improving the security of a user authentication system. The current system stores user passwords hashed with a cryptographic hash function. To enhance the security against potential attacks, which of the following practices should Alice implement? (Select all that apply)"
 "A": "Implement salting by adding random data to each password before hashing to prevent the use of rainbow tables."
 "B": "Increase the complexity of user passwords by enforcing password strength requirements to reduce the efficacy of common password lists."
 "C": "Use a slower hash function designed for password hashing, such as bcrypt, to reduce the feasibility of brute-force attacks."
 "D": "Store the plaintext passwords in a secure, encrypted database to prevent unauthorized access in case of a security breach."
Answer: ABC
