RF-ID Gate
Gates can be installed at any place: At the entrance and exit doors, the stock etc...

ISO 15693 Tags
Each tag has an unique identiﬁer (UID)
UID is needed for anti-collision algorithm if more then
one tag is in the ﬁeld
UID is factory programmed and can’t be changed
The Tag Memory is partitioned into two blocks
Administrative Block that contains
unique identiﬁer (UID)
application family identiﬁer (AFI)
data storage format identiﬁer (DSFID)
User Data
stores up to 128 Byte of User Data persistent

RF-DUMP
a small tool to read and write ISO Tags and
Smart-Labels by Boris Wolf and Lukas Grunwald
supports and detects nearly all Smart-Labels
requires an ACG Compact-Flash RF-ID Reader
runs on PDA and notebook
Free-Software (GPL) http://www.rf-dump.org

The RSA Blocker-Tag Part 1
At the CeBIT 2004 RSA Security announced and
demonstrated a "blocker-tag": This Tag was said to
block any requests.
They presented a demo with their Tag and a box of
drugs, and a paper-bag with the Blocker-Tag.
This Tag should send all possible UID’s to keep the
customer’s privacy when leaving a drugstore.
Let’s verify the information with our new tool!
RF-ID and Smart-Labels: Myth, Technology and Attacks – p. 33
The RSA Blocker-Tag Part 2
All pseudo-privacy is done by the fake software.
If both Tags are in the RF-ID Field, the RSA
Demo-Application claims "BLOCKED".
In fact the customer information is still accessible by an
attacker or a spy.
RF-ID and Smart-Labels: Myth, Technology and Attacks – p. 34
Attacks against Smart-Labels
Most Smart-Labels are not write protected
The UID and Administrative block can’t store the EPC
EPC is stored in the User Data Area
Meta-Data like "best-before" are also stored in the User
Data Area
It’s only a matter of time until everybody will wear at
least one RF-ID Tag
RF-ID and Smart-Labels: Myth, Technology and Attacks – p. 35
Privacy Problems
Gates can by installed anywhere
Competitors can read what type of undies you wear,
and what else you have in your shopping bag
Big Brother can read what type of Books you read
Together with a passport or customer-card with RF-ID
Chip this technology is an even bigger risk
The customer is traceable for everyone
RF-ID and Smart-Labels: Myth, Technology and Attacks – p. 36
Environmental Pollution
If every retail packet has a RF-ID Chip, there will be a
sizable environmental pollution issue
The transponder or tag itself contains some harmful
substances
Non-ionizing radiation, there are some voices that say it
could be unhealthy
RF-ID and Smart-Labels: Myth, Technology and Attacks – p. 37
Technology Problems
Dependency on a new technology introduces new risks
Attacks to the RF-ID infrastructure can push companies
out of business
New possible break for terrorist attacks and new critical
infrastructure
RF-ID and Smart-Labels: Myth, Technology and Attacks – p. 38
Real-Life Cookie
Like on Web-Sites you can put a real-life cookie on
someone who wears a cloth with Smart-Label or carries
an item with a Tag.
Every time he passes your Gate or RF-ID Field e.g.
in front of your shop window you increment it by one
The next time you get your credit-card number, you
can write his tag with a clear id, you know who was
looking at you shop window
You can also check if the customer takes a product
out of the shelf and puts it back, so if he is unclear,
you can make an instant discount only for him in 10
sec.

The Metro Future-Store
RF-ID and Smart-Labels: Myth, Technology and Attacks – p. 40
The Metro Future-Store
Initiated by the Metro Corporation and a several
technology partners
First store using RF-ID technology at some customer
shelves
Uses RF-ID Technology for age-control for X-Rated
movies
uses RF-ID Technology for every palette in stock
Puts ISO-Tags also in customer cards.
After immense protest from privacy organizations
offered a RF-ID De-activator
Nice homepage http://www.future-store.org

The Metro Future-Store
Customer can use a PSA (Personal Shopping
Assistant) and can check every product he puts in his
shopping bag
Customer can also use a self-checkout
Customer is the guinea pig for the new technology
Perfect area for our ﬁrst ﬁeld test of RF-Dump

The RFID-Deactivator
After the checkout Metro offers a "RFID-Deactivator" to
the customer
In fact, it overwrites the User-Data Area with Zeros
Tag can be rewritten after the De-Activation
Serial-ID and Administrative Block can’t be erased
At the Exit-Gate the Tag can be instantly ﬁlled with other
information
To use the Deactivator all User-Data Areas MUST be
writable in the shop, which offers a lot of options for new
attacks and fun in the shop.

Chaos in the Future-Store
You can convert the EPC from cream cheese into
shampoo, the store computer believes your cream
cheese is misplaced in this shelf
Put the cream cheese after converting in the shampoo
shelf
Make some X-Rated movies G-Rated, now Kid’s can
buy them with the Self-Checkout
Convert your favored new DVD into the one on sale for
5 Euro
RF-ID and Smart-Labels: Myth, Technology and Attacks – p. 49
Fun with the EAS
1. The Electronic Article Surveillance (EAS) Gate at the
Entrance checks also if you don’t pay for your DVD via
RF-ID.
2. To deactivate this Security System, get a cheap Tag for
50 cents, copy the EPC from a DVD that is in the shelf
3. Transfer it to you own tag
4. Stick the Tag under the Gate
5. The Gates goes on alert
6. Some clerk will come and check, after 5 minutes of
permanent alarming he will switch the EAS Gate off
RF-ID and Smart-Labels: Myth, Technology and Attacks – p. 50
Further Attacks
The most software is written without security in mind, at
least supply chain software, it could be possible to
exploit it via a manipulated data ﬁeld in the User-Data of
an RF-ID Tag
Some registers make an instant reboot after reading the
RF-ID Tag with manipulated ﬁeld
If you shield the ﬁeld, no EAS or RF-ID System can
possibly read a tag, some aluminum foil works ﬁne
RF-ID and Smart-Labels: Myth, Technology and Attacks – p. 51
For Your Privacy
DO NOT buy any product with a credit card and do not
use any customer cards
If you MUST use a credit card, add entropy to your
customer record
there are some interesting pages e.g:

http://www.boycottgillette.com
http://www.boycottbenetton.org
http://www.spychips.com
RF-ID and Smart-Labels: Myth, Technology and Attacks – p. 52
Risks for the Companies
Whole new area of shop-lifting
Chaos and attacks are possible
Customers can change the EPC and no-one will detect
it when using self-checkout
Attacks can also be used on medical drugs and
age-restricted material
Attackers need only a publicly available RF-ID
