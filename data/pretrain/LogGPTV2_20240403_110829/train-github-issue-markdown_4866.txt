  * VSCode Version: 0.10.11
  * OS Version: OS X El Capitan 10.11.4
  * Node Version: 5.10.1
Steps to Reproduce:
  1. Launch code from terminal `code .`. It fails with the following error -
    File "", line 1
    import os,sys; print os.path.realpath(sys.argv[1])
                              ^
    SyntaxError: invalid syntax
    /usr/local/bin/code: line 10: ./MacOS/Electron: No such file or directory
It used to work perfectly alright before the OS X upgrade to 10.11.4. Just to
be sure, I uninstalled code from PATH and installed it again through command
palette but no luck.
