Question: "An iOS app developer wants to ensure that a stored secret authentication token can only be accessed after successful Touch ID authentication and it is only available on the current device when the passcode is set. Which attribute and parameter should be used when saving the secret token to the iOS keychain to meet these requirements?"
 "A": "Use `kSecAttrAccessibleWhenUnlocked` as the attribute with `SecAccessControlCreateFlags.biometryAny` as the parameter."
 "B": "Use `kSecAttrAccessibleAlways` attribute to ensure the token is always accessible for user convenience."
 "C": "Use `kSecAttrAccessibleWhenPasscodeSetThisDeviceOnly` as the attribute with `SecAccessControlCreateFlags.biometryCurrentSet` as the parameter."
 "D": "Implement a `SecAccessControlCreateFlags.userPresence` parameter to allow access based solely on user presence without any biometric check."
Answer: C
