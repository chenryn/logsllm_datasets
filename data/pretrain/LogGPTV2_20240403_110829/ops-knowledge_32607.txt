Question: A development team has implemented a new authentication system for their web application. Upon security review, it was discovered that while the authentication algorithm was secure, a flaw in the system allowed an attacker to bypass the authentication process entirely. Which of the following could be the primary weakness that allowed for the authentication bypass?
"A": "The server uses unencrypted HTTP requests, allowing an attacker to capture and replay login information.",
"B": "Input validation is not enforced on the username field, permitting SQL injection attacks.",
"C": "Session tokens are not invalidated after logout, enabling session fixation attacks.",
"D": "The cryptographic hash function used for passwords is outdated, making it vulnerable to rainbow table attacks."
Answer: B
