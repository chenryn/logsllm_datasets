ABSTRACT
Understanding social network structure and evolution has impor-
tant implications for many aspects of network and system design
including provisioning, bootstrapping trust and reputation systems
via social networks, and defenses against Sybil attacks. Several re-
cent results suggest that augmenting the social network structure
with user attributes (e.g., location, employer, communities of inter-
est) can provide a more ﬁne-grained understanding of social net-
works. However, there have been few studies to provide a system-
atic understanding of these effects at scale.
We bridge this gap using a unique dataset collected as the Google+
social network grew over time since its release in late June 2011.
We observe novel phenomena with respect to both standard social
network metrics and new attribute-related metrics (that we deﬁne).
We also observe interesting evolutionary patterns as Google+ went
from a bootstrap phase to a steady invitation-only stage before a
public release.
Based on our empirical observations, we develop a new gener-
ative model to jointly reproduce the social structure and the node
attributes. Using theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations, we
show that our model can accurately reproduce the social and at-
tribute structure of real social networks. We also demonstrate that
our model provides more accurate predictions for practical appli-
cation contexts.

INTRODUCTION
Online social networks (e.g., Facebook, Google+, Twitter) have
become increasingly important platforms for interacting with peo-
ple, processing information and diffusing social inﬂuence. Thus
understanding social-network structure and evolution has impor-
tant implications for many aspects of network and system design
including bootstrapping reputation via social networks (e.g., [39]),
defenses against Sybil attacks (e.g., [14]), leveraging social net-
works for search [1], and recommender systems with social regu-
larization [35].
Traditional social network studies have largely focused on un-
derstanding the topological structure of the social network, where
each user can be viewed as a node and a speciﬁc relationship (e.g.,
friendship, co-authorship) is represented by a link between two
nodes. More recently, there has been growing interest in augment-
ing this social network with user attributes, which we call as Social-
Attribute Network (SAN). User attributes could be static (e.g., school,
major, employer and city derived from user proﬁles), or dynamic
(e.g., online interest and community groups). Recent studies have
demonstrated the promise of social-attribute networks in applica-
tions such as link prediction [58, 17], attribute inference [17, 58],
and community detection [62].
Despite the growing importance of such social-attribute networks
in social network analysis applications, there have been few efforts
at systematically measuring and modeling the evolution of social-
attribute networks. Most prior work in the measurement and mod-
eling space focuses primarily on the social structure [3, 4, 13, 26,
28, 33, 38]. Measuring social-attribute networks can simultane-
ously inform us the properties of social network structure, attribute
structure, and how such attributes impact social network structure.
In this paper, we present a detailed study of the evolution of
social-attribute networks using a unique large-scale dataset col-
lected by crawling the Google+ social network struture and its user
proﬁles. This dataset offers a unique opportunity for us as we were
fortunate to observe the complete evolution of the social network
and its growth to around 30 million users within a span of three
months.
We observe novel patterns in the growth of the Google+ social-
attribute network. First, we observe that the social reciprocity of
Google+ is lower than many traditional social networks and is closer
to that of Twitter. Second, in contrast to many prior networks,
the social degree distributions in Google+ are best modeled by
a lognormal distribution. Third, we observe that assortativity of
131Google+ social network is neutral while many other social net-
works own positive assortativities. Fourth, we also see that the
distinct phases (initial launch, invite only, public release) in the
timeline of Google+ naturally manifest themselves in the social and
attribute structures. Fifth, for the generalized attribute metrics (that
we deﬁne), while some attribute metrics mirror their social counter-
parts (e.g., diameter), several show distributions and trends that are
signiﬁcantly different (e.g., clustering coefﬁcient, attribute degree).
Finally, via the social-attribute network framework, we study the
impact of user attributes on the social structure and observe that
nodes sharing common attributes are likely to have higher social
reciprocity and that some attributes have much stronger inﬂuence
than others (e.g., Employer vs. City).
Based on our observations, we develop a new generative model
for SANs. Our model includes two new components, i.e., attribute-
augmented preferential attachment and attribute-augmented triangle-
closing, which extend the classical preferential attachment [5, 27]
and triangle-closing [29, 43, 53, 2], respectively. Using both theo-
retical analysis and empirical evaluation, we show that our model
can reproduce SANs that accurately reﬂect the true ones with re-
spect to various network metrics and real-world applications. Such
a generative model has a lot of applications [30] such as network
extrapolation and sampling, network visualization and compres-
sion, and network anonymization [44].
To summarize, the key contributions of this work are:
• We perform the ﬁrst study of the evolution of social-attribute
networks using Google+. We observe novel phenomena in stan-
dard social structure metrics and new attribute-related metrics
(that we deﬁne) and how attributes impact the social structure.
• We develop a measurement-driven generative model for the
social-attribute network that models the impact of user attributes
into the network evolution.
• Using both theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation, we
validate that our model can accurately reproduce real social-
attribute networks.
2. PRELIMINARIES AND DATASET
In this section, we begin with some background on augmenting
social network structure with attributes. Then, we describe how
we collected the Google+ data and how we augment the Google+
social network with user attribute information. We also present
some basic measurements describing the evolution of the Google+.
2.1 Social-Attribute Network (SAN)
In this section, we review the deﬁnition of Social-Attribute Net-
work (SAN) [17] and introduce the basic notations used in the rest
of this paper.
Given a directed social network G, in which nodes are users and
edges represent friend relationships between users, and M distinct
binary attributes, which could be static (e.g., name of employer,
name of school, major, etc.) or dynamic (e.g., interest groups),
a SAN is an augmented network with M additional nodes where
each such node corresponds to a speciﬁc binary attribute. For each
node u in G with attribute a, we create an undirected link between
u and a in the SAN.
Nodes in a SAN corresponding to nodes in G are called social
nodes and denoted as the set Vs, while nodes representing attributes
are called attribute nodes and denoted as the set Va. Figure 1
shows an example SAN. Links between social nodes are called
social links and denoted as the set Es, while links between so-
cial nodes and attribute nodes are called attribute links and de-

tribute nodes. Note that the social links between users are directed
whereas the attribute-user links are undirected.
noted as the set Ea. Thus a Social-Attribute Network is denoted
as SAN = (Vs, Va, Es, Ea).
For a given social or attribute node u in a SAN, we denote its
attribute neighbors as Γa(u) = {v|v ∈ Va, (u, v) ∈ Ea}, social
neighbors as Γs(u) = {v|v ∈ Vs, (v, u) ∈ Es ∪ Ea or (u, v) ∈
Es ∪ Ea}, social in neighbors as Γs,in(u) = {v|(v, u) ∈ Es} and
social out neighbors as Γs,out(u) = {v|(u, v) ∈ Es}. Note that
an attribute node can only have social neighbors.
2.2 Google+ Data
Google+ was launched with an invitation-only test phase on June
28, 2011, and opened to everyone 18 years of age or older on
September 20, 2011. We believed this was a tremendous oppor-
tunity to observe the real-world evolution of a large-scale social-
attribute network. Thus, we began to crawl daily snapshots of pub-
lic Google+ social network structure and user proﬁles; our crawls
lasted from July 6 to October 11, 2011. The ﬁrst snapshot was
crawled by breadth-ﬁrst search (without early stopping). On sub-
sequent days, we expanded the social structure from the previous
snapshot. For most snapshots, our crawl ﬁnished within one day as
Google did not limit the crawl rate during that time.
We believe our crawl collected a large Weakly Connected Com-
ponent (WCC) of Google+. This may be surprising as many past
attempts on Flickr, Facebook, YouTube etc., were unable to do
so [38]. The key difference is that these were only able to access
outgoing links. In contrast, each user in Google+ has both an out-
going list (i.e., “in your circles”) and an incoming list (i.e., “have
you in circles”). This allows us to access both outgoing and incom-
ing links making it feasible to crawl the entire WCC.
We have two points of reference that suggest our coverage is high
(≥ 70%): 1) TechCrunch estimated the number of Google+ users
on July 12, 2011 is around 10 million [52]; our crawled snapshot
on the same day has 7 million users. (2) Google announced 40 mil-
lion users had joined Google+ in middle October [19]; our crawled
snapshot on October 11 has around 30 million users.
We take each user u in Google+ as a social node in SAN, and
connect it to her outgoing friends via outgoing links and incom-
ing friends via incoming links. We use four attribute types School,
Major, Employer and City that were available and easy to extract.
Speciﬁcally, we ﬁnd all distinct schools, majors, employers and
cities that appear in at least one user proﬁle and use them as at-
tribute nodes. Recall that a social node u is connected to attribute
node a via an undirected link if u has attribute a. In this way, we
construct a SAN from each crawled snapshot, resulting in 79 SANs
during the period from July 6 to October 11, 2011.
Figures 2 and 3 show the temporal evolution of the number of
nodes and links in the Google+ SAN. From the results we clearly
see three distinct phases in the evolution of Google+: Phase I from

in the context of Google+ both because of its scale and because it
enables a somewhat hybrid relationship model compared to other
networks such as Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, and email networks.
Furthermore, since we have a unique opportunity to observe the
network as it grew, we also analyze how these properties changed
as the Google+ SAN evolved.
3.1 Reciprocity
The reciprocity metric for directed social networks represents the
fraction of social links that are mutual; i.e., if there is a A → B
edge what is the likelihood of the reverse B → A edge. Pre-
vious work studied the global reciprocities for speciﬁc snapshots
of social networks and measured it to be 0.62 on Flickr, 0.79 on
YouTube [38], and 0.22 on Twitter [28]. We focus on the evo-
lution of global reciprocity for Google+ in Figure 4a. The result
shows an interesting behavior where the reciprocity ﬂuctuates in
Phase I, decreases in Phase II and decreases even faster in Phase
III. We speculate that this arises because of the hybrid nature of
Google+. Initially many people treat the network like a traditional
social network (e.g., Facebook) where the relationships are mutual.
However, as time progresses and people appear to become famil-
iar with the Twitter-like publisher-subscriber model also offered by
Google+, the reciprocity decreases.
3.2 Density
The ratio of links-to-nodes, |Es|
|Vs| , captures the density 1 of a so-
cial network. To put this in context, previous studies show that the
social density increases over time on citation and afﬁliation net-
works [33], on Facebook [4], and ﬂuctuates in an increase-decrease-
increase fashion on Flickr [26], and is relatively constant on email
communication networks [25].
Figure 4b shows the evolution of this social density metric in
Google+. We observe that social density in Google+ network has
a sharp decrease followed by an increase in Phase I, a continued
increase in Phase II, and a sudden drop in Phase III (when Google+
opened to the public) followed by a steady increase again. This
three-phase pattern can be explained in conjunction with the trends
in Figures 2a and 3a. In the early part of Phase I, even though the
rate of users joining Google+ is high, the rate of adding links is
