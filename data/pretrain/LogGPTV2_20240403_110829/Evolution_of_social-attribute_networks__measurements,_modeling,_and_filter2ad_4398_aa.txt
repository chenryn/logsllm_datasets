## Abstract

Understanding the structure and evolution of social networks is crucial for various aspects of network and system design, including provisioning, trust and reputation systems, and defenses against Sybil attacks. Recent studies suggest that incorporating user attributes (e.g., location, employer, communities of interest) into social network analysis can provide a more nuanced understanding. However, there has been limited research on the systematic study of these effects at scale.

We address this gap using a unique dataset collected as the Google+ social network grew from its release in late June 2011. Our observations reveal novel phenomena in both standard social network metrics and new attribute-related metrics. We also identify interesting evolutionary patterns as Google+ transitioned from a bootstrap phase to an invitation-only stage before its public release.

Based on our empirical findings, we develop a generative model to jointly reproduce the social structure and node attributes. Through theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations, we demonstrate that our model accurately reproduces the social and attribute structure of real social networks and provides more accurate predictions for practical applications.

## 1. Introduction

Online social networks (e.g., Facebook, Google+, Twitter) have become essential platforms for interaction, information processing, and social influence diffusion. Understanding their structure and evolution is vital for various applications, such as bootstrapping reputation, defending against Sybil attacks, leveraging social networks for search, and enhancing recommender systems with social regularization.

Traditional social network studies have focused on the topological structure, where each user is a node and relationships (e.g., friendship, co-authorship) are represented by links. Recently, there has been growing interest in augmenting this structure with user attributes, forming Social-Attribute Networks (SANs). User attributes can be static (e.g., school, major, employer, city) or dynamic (e.g., online interests, community groups). SANs have shown promise in applications like link prediction, attribute inference, and community detection.

Despite the importance of SANs, few studies have systematically measured and modeled their evolution. Most prior work focuses on the social structure. Measuring SANs can inform us about the properties of social and attribute structures and how attributes impact the social network.

In this paper, we present a detailed study of the evolution of SANs using a large-scale dataset collected from the Google+ social network. This dataset allows us to observe the complete evolution of the social network and its growth to around 30 million users within three months.

We observe several novel patterns in the growth of the Google+ SAN:
1. The reciprocity of Google+ is lower than many traditional social networks and closer to that of Twitter.
2. The social degree distributions in Google+ are best modeled by a lognormal distribution.
3. The assortativity of the Google+ social network is neutral, unlike many other social networks with positive assortativity.
4. The distinct phases (initial launch, invite only, public release) in the timeline of Google+ manifest in the social and attribute structures.
5. For the generalized attribute metrics, some mirror their social counterparts (e.g., diameter), while others show significantly different distributions and trends (e.g., clustering coefficient, attribute degree).
6. Nodes sharing common attributes tend to have higher social reciprocity, and some attributes (e.g., Employer) have a stronger influence than others (e.g., City).

Based on these observations, we develop a new generative model for SANs. Our model includes attribute-augmented preferential attachment and attribute-augmented triangle-closing, extending classical models. We validate our model through theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation, showing it can accurately reproduce real SANs and has applications in network extrapolation, sampling, visualization, compression, and anonymization.

**Key Contributions:**
- First study of the evolution of SANs using Google+.
- Development of a measurement-driven generative model for SANs.
- Validation of the model's accuracy in reproducing real SANs.

## 2. Preliminaries and Dataset

### 2.1 Social-Attribute Network (SAN)

A Social-Attribute Network (SAN) [17] is an augmented social network with M additional nodes representing binary attributes. Each node u in the social network G, which represents a user, is connected to attribute nodes via undirected links if u has the corresponding attribute. Nodes in G are called social nodes (Vs), and nodes representing attributes are called attribute nodes (Va). Links between social nodes are called social links (Es), and links between social and attribute nodes are called attribute links (Ea). A SAN is denoted as SAN = (Vs, Va, Es, Ea).

For a given social or attribute node u, we define:
- Attribute neighbors: Γa(u) = {v | v ∈ Va, (u, v) ∈ Ea}
- Social neighbors: Γs(u) = {v | v ∈ Vs, (v, u) ∈ Es ∪ Ea or (u, v) ∈ Es ∪ Ea}
- Social in-neighbors: Γs,in(u) = {v | (v, u) ∈ Es}
- Social out-neighbors: Γs,out(u) = {v | (u, v) ∈ Es}

### 2.2 Google+ Data

Google+ was launched with an invitation-only test phase on June 28, 2011, and opened to everyone 18 years or older on September 20, 2011. We began crawling daily snapshots of the public Google+ social network and user profiles from July 6 to October 11, 2011. Our initial snapshot was crawled using breadth-first search, and subsequent snapshots expanded from the previous day's data. Our crawl rate was not limited by Google, allowing us to capture a large Weakly Connected Component (WCC) of Google+.

Our coverage is estimated to be high (≥ 70%) based on:
1. TechCrunch's estimate of 10 million users on July 12, 2011, compared to our 7 million users.
2. Google's announcement of 40 million users in mid-October, compared to our 30 million users on October 11.

Each user in Google+ is a social node, connected to outgoing and incoming friends. We use four attribute types: School, Major, Employer, and City. Distinct schools, majors, employers, and cities from user profiles are used as attribute nodes. We construct a SAN from each crawled snapshot, resulting in 79 SANs during the period.

Figures 2 and 3 show the temporal evolution of the number of nodes and links in the Google+ SAN, revealing three distinct phases in its evolution.

## 3. Evolutionary Patterns

### 3.1 Reciprocity

Reciprocity in directed social networks is the fraction of mutual social links. Previous studies found global reciprocities of 0.62 on Flickr, 0.79 on YouTube, and 0.22 on Twitter. Figure 4a shows the evolution of global reciprocity in Google+. The reciprocity fluctuates in Phase I, decreases in Phase II, and decreases even faster in Phase III. This behavior may be due to the hybrid nature of Google+, where users initially treat it like a traditional social network but later adopt a publisher-subscriber model similar to Twitter.

### 3.2 Density

Density is the ratio of links to nodes, |Es| / |Vs|. Previous studies show that density increases over time on citation and affiliation networks, on Facebook, and fluctuates on Flickr, while it remains relatively constant on email communication networks.

Figure 4b shows the evolution of social density in Google+. The density sharply decreases followed by an increase in Phase I, continues to increase in Phase II, and drops suddenly in Phase III (when Google+ opened to the public) before increasing again. This pattern can be explained by the trends in Figures 2a and 3a. In early Phase I, despite a high rate of new users, the rate of adding links is low, leading to a decrease in density.
