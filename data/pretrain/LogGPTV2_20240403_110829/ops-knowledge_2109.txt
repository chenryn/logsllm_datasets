User: Is there a source tarball of Twisted available for download which could be used to build it in Fedora or CentOS? I see the download for Ubuntu/Debian on the site, of course.
Assistant: To get the latest version of Twisted requires Python 2.7+ because 2.6 support has finally been EOL.  So if you're running an old Python, then I'd suggest you build your own Python 2.7+ and alt install it.  It's very important you don't override CentOS's default Python as this could lead to a disastrous situation.  Once Python is updated, then you can do pip install twisted.  Alternatively, you could get a yum repo with a updated versions of Python and Twisted.
