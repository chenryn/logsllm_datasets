User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Centos logrotate found error, skipping One of our servers has a access_log which is nearly 5GB in size - there is currently no log rotation so I enabled it yesterday for httpd

The contents of /etc/logrotate.d/httpd is

/var/log/*.log {
    weekly
    missingok
    notifempty
    sharedscripts
    delaycompress
    postrotate
        /sbin/service httpd reload &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;/dev/null || true
    endscript
}


When logrotate runs it generates an error:

Anacron job 'cron.daily' on

/etc/cron.daily/logrotate:

error: found error in /var/log/*.log , skipping


I cannot see what the error might be as these all look like valid parameters - any idea what is the issue?

Assistant: This is caused because of your /var/log/*.log which will create a duplicate entry that conflicts with the logs defined in one or more of the other files in /etc/logrotate.d/ for example dracut, syslog and others. 

You can test this by running logrotate on the command line, this is the output I get if I use your httpd file on my CentOS 6.7 system

logrotate /etc/logrotate.conf
error: httpd:1 duplicate log entry for /var/log/dracut.log
error: found error in /var/log/*.log , skipping
other irrelevant output skipped.


I don't know how you have configured your httpd but the defaults for CentOS would be to write logs to /var/log/httpd/ so a common configuration for /etc/logrotate.d/httpd config would be

/var/log/httpd/*log {
    missingok
    notifempty
    sharedscripts
    delaycompress
    postrotate
        /sbin/service httpd reload &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;/dev/null || true
    endscript


If you have changed the default logging location for httpd, perhaps it would be easier to put it back as it was and then use the common config above.

If you can't then you're going to have to list the individual log files that you want rotating (which may be more work than you want)

/var/log/access_log
/var/log/error_log
/var/log/vhost1_access_log
and so on... {
    missingok
    notifempty
    sharedscripts
    delaycompress
    postrotate
        /sbin/service httpd reload &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;/dev/null || true
    endscript
