In Figure 8 we ﬁx n = 2000 and analyze the number
length terms involved in each of the n − 1 ordering
of
constraints for varying values of k, independently of the DB.
The minimum number of length terms for all k values is one
and corresponds to the ﬁrst constraint that has only a single
length term involved. The average and maximum number of
length terms are inversely proportional to k. As a result, the
combination of small diameter (i.e., concentrated values) of
the tested dataset and the above sensitivity to the compound
error results in a higher percentage of failures when k is small.

B. Evaluation of Ordered Response Attack
Table II shows the accuracy of the approximate reconstruc-
tion attack for ordered responses. For this experiment, we
simulated the query leakage by ordering the k returned ids.
Note that the number of queries is signiﬁcantly reduced. Since
1) the feasible region and its diameter does not play any role
and 2) the estimation of each value is a function of only 3
bisectors, the quality of the reconstruction is almost unaffected
by the value of k. Similarly to the case of unordered responses,
the accuracy of the reconstruction grows signiﬁcantly with the
number of observed queries.
On Efﬁciency and Number of Queries. We report
that having observed enough queries our experiments took
a few seconds to reconstruction the plaintext values. We
also report that for the accuracy, i.e. , δ, that we observed
from the reconstructed output the theoretical lower bound
of our theorems required orders of magnitude more queries.
Therefore even though we have rigorous analysis for the
required number of queries, our experiments demonstrate that
we need a signiﬁcantly smaller number of queries in practice.
VI. EXTENSIONS & OPEN PROBLEMS
In this section, we discuss approaches toward extending our
attack techniques to work under different assumptions.
Nonuniform Query Distribution. The query-uniformity
assumption A1 simpliﬁes the estimation of the lengths of the
Voronoi segments. More work is therefore required to adjust
the analysis to arbitrary query distributions. In particular, an
attacker with knowledge of the (not necessarily uniform) query
distribution can use our techniques and weigh the contribution
of each response to our estimators.
Recovery Under Partial and Auxiliary Information. A
phase of our attack is the reconstruction of the order of the
identiﬁers with respect to their values. Towards this goal, we
ﬁrst considered the scenario where the attacker observes all
possible responses (Section III). In certain cases, it is possible
to reconstruct the order even without seeing all responses.
Namely, a variation of Algorithm 2 from Lacharit´e et al. [28]
can be used to reconstruct the order of the identiﬁers from a
collection of overlapping k-NN responses whenever the order
can be inferred from such responses.
Another setting that could be considered is the one where
the adversary observes a subset of the identiﬁers. Speciﬁcally,
when the attacker sees the identiﬁers for a range of consecutive
Voronoi segments,
the adversary can directly utilize our
techniques and the adjusted frequency of the responses to ﬁnd
the geometry of the local structure of this subset of identiﬁers.
in Sec-
tion IV-B, we partitioned the database into k non-overlapping
sets of records with respect to their dependence on the ξ offset.
Interestingly, an attacker with knowledge of the location of
a single value from each of the k non-overlapping sets can
achieve exact reconstruction even in the case of unordered
responses.
Regarding the power of auxiliary information,
Attack with Varying Parameter k. An interesting variation
occurs when parameter k can change on every k-NN query.
Our attacks can not be directly applied to this case. We expect
that a solution to this open problem involves similar intuition
to our techniques, i.e. estimation of the length of Voronoi
segments and then formulation of equations based on the
derived locations of the bisectors. Note that the response set of
a database with ﬁxed k parameter is a subset of the response set
for varying k parameter. Furthermore, for one-dimensional data,
the response set for all possible varying k values is exactly the
same as the response set of range queries in the same database.
Intuitively, the attacker of the k-NN leakage proﬁle for a ﬁxed
k has “less information to work with” compared to the attacker
of varying k-NN proﬁle and range queries proﬁle.
Practical Considerations. Practitioners must be cautious
with the deployment of encrypted databases that support k-NN
queries. In our work, we showed that reconstruction is possible
for databases of moderate size with high accuracy and rigorous
reconstruction guarantees. Also, our ﬁndings show that the
ordering of the responses (a useful feature as far as the user is
concerned) leaks signiﬁcantly more information and allows a
reconstruction with orders of magnitude fewer queries.
