Bug
**What is the current behavior?**
The unsafe lifecycle function aliases in 16.3.2 are not merged when defined
more than once because of mixins, triggering an error:
> Uncaught Error: ReactClassInterface: You are attempting to define
> `UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps` on your component more than once. This
> conflict may be due to a mixin.
To reproduce: rename all cWM, cWRP, and cWU functions with their UNSAFE_
versions in a project where mixins cause those functions to be duplicated
**What is the expected behavior?**
That these lifecyle function continue to work as expected when called via
UNSAFE aliases in 16.3, and if they are not supposed to with regard to
redefining/merging, that the migration path documentation is updated to
indicate so.
