The total capacity of the SAN storage device composed of 10 disk cabinets is 240TB. For the storage requirements of production data, it is necessary to consider the capacity requirements of files, databases, virtual machines, etc., as well as the future expansion requirements. 2. Backup scheme: In order to ensure data security, production data needs to be backed up. The backup method can choose full backup or incremental backup, and the backup cycle can be determined according to business needs. The backup data can be stored in disk or tape, and the encryption and storage period of the backup data need to be set at the same time.
