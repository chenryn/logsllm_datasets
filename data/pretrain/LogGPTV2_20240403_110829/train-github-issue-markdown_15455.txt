If we add "pull-right" in navbar-nav class ul tag for right align links.  
Then when we expand and collapse navbar menu once then it does not get open
again on clicking the navbar-toggle in mobile device.
here is the bootply example:

  1. but if we don't keep pull right in navbar-nav it works fine.
  2. if we have 2 navbar-nav class ul tag one with pull-right (2nd ul tag) and other without it (1st ul tag) then it works again. Here is bootply version of that too:

Update-1 : In Chrome, it does collapse and expand as many times as we want but
it collapse abruptly ( without animation)
