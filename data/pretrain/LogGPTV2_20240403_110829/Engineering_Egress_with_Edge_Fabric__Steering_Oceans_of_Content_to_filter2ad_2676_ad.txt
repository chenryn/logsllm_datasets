### 6.1 Placing Traffic on Alternate Paths

To overcome BGP's limitation of only supporting destination-based routing, we developed a mechanism that allows us to route specific flows via selected paths. This mechanism requires minimal modifications at servers and peering routers and does not necessitate coordination between servers and other network elements. Servers can make per-flow decisions without knowledge of the network state at peering routers.

- **Flow Selection and Marking:**
  - Servers select and mark specific flows for special treatment.
  - The DSCP field in the IP packets of selected flows is set to one of a set of predefined values.
  - For example, servers can mark a flow to measure the performance of an alternate path or to indicate that the flow is carrying real-time, performance-sensitive traffic.

- **Policy Routing at Peering Routers (PRs):**
  - PRs use policy routing to match the markings applied by servers and route corresponding packets based on alternate routing tables.
  - A unique routing table is installed for each DSCP value.

- **Controller-Injected Routes:**
  - A controller injects routes into the alternate routing tables at PRs to control how marked flows are routed.
  - If the controller has not injected a route for a particular destination, marked flows will be routed based on the PR’s default routing table.

This approach does not require continuous synchronization between servers, routers, and controllers. Servers can continuously tag packets without any knowledge of the network state, and controllers can inject routes into alternate routing tables as needed.

Additionally, the aggregation switch (ASW) layer does not need to be aware of the DSCP values assigned to flows and can forward IP traffic based on BGP’s best route for the destination prefix. However, if the PR with the best route does not connect to the peer providing the alternate route, the controller injects the alternate route at PRs that lack the peer, setting the next hop of the route to a PR that connects to the peer. To avoid loops, PRs are configured to address each other via labels (using ISIS-SR) and tunnel traffic via ASWs using MPLS forwarding.

### 6.2 Measuring Performance of Alternate Paths

End-user TCP connections terminate at front-end servers at the edge of our network, which then proxy HTTP requests to backend servers. We use the mechanism described in Section 6.1 to randomly select a subset of these connections and route them via alternate paths. This allows us to collect performance measurements using Facebook’s existing infrastructure, which logs the performance of client connections observed by the front-end servers.

#### 6.2.1 Randomly Selecting Flows

We implemented a program that runs on front-end servers to randomly select flows and mark them for routing via alternate paths using the Extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) instruction set. eBPF allows the program to be loaded into the kernel, where it can efficiently process all egressing packets from the server. No changes are required to existing client or server applications.

- **Random Selection and Marking:**
  - The eBPF program randomly selects a configurable fraction of flows for alternate path measurements.
  - The DSCP field in all IP packets of the selected flow is set to a DSCP value reserved for alternate path measurements.
  - The program’s configuration can be dynamically updated and contains the percentage of flows that should be mapped to each DSCP value reserved for measurements.

For example, to measure two extra paths per prefix, the configuration could assign 0.75% of flows the DSCP value 12 and 0.25% of flows the DSCP value 24. Given the scale of Facebook, sampling a small fraction of connections still results in a large set of measurements. By using passive measurements based on existing production traffic, we avoid active measurements (e.g., pings) that may not represent real user performance.

#### 6.2.2 Injecting Routes

We built an AltPath controller to inject routes into alternate routing tables. The controller generates alternate paths for prefixes with traffic in the past 10 minutes, significantly reducing the size of alternate routing tables.

- **Route Injection:**
  - Every 30 seconds, the AltPath controller uses BGP routes retrieved from the BMP Collector service to decide on an alternate path for each prefix, for each DSCP value being assigned by servers.
  - The controller then uses the BGP Injector service to inject alternate routes for each DSCP value into the corresponding routing table at PRs.

The AltPath controller takes as input a set of destination ASNs that it will not perform alternate path measurements for. Our traffic engineering team adds networks known to have extremely poor performance on alternate paths to avoid negatively impacting end-users.

#### 6.2.3 Measuring Performance

At the termination of (a sample of) client TCP connections, our front-end servers log metrics used to evaluate path performance. These servers use a separate eBPF program to capture statistics at connection termination for sampled TCP connections, with a typical sampling rate of 1 out of every 1000 connections. The statistics include retransmission rate, retransmission timeout (RTO), smoothed round-trip times (SRTT), and the number of segments sent/received. Additionally, the servers sample HTTP transactions and measure per-response client download goodput. The servers also record the DSCP field value assigned to the connection by the eBPF program, if any. A collector joins samples with egress route information so that samples can be grouped by the route they traversed and performance statistics can be aggregated per route.

### 6.3 Future Uses of Performance-Aware Routing

The mechanisms described in Sections 6.1 and 6.2 allow us to route traffic along alternate paths and measure performance. In this section, we explore how we can build upon these mechanisms to improve user performance.

#### 6.3.1 Overriding BGP Decisions

Today, Edge Fabric overrides BGP’s default decision process to mitigate congestion at the edge of Facebook’s network. Going forward, we can improve Edge Fabric by incorporating AltPath measurements.

- **Performance Improvement:**
  - Edge Fabric can use the measurements to identify scenarios where performance can be improved by overriding BGP’s default decisions, even when the edge is not congested.
  - When performance on the current path degrades, AltPath measurements can determine whether the problem can be avoided via a path change or if it impacts all paths (as might happen with severe congestion close to the destination).
  - Edge Fabric can use alternate path measurements to ensure that traffic is placed on the best-performing detour path whenever congestion occurs.

Initial results on the promise of these use cases are provided in Section 7.3. Finally, alternate path measurements can help network operators understand how performance will be impacted if traffic is detoured, aiding in network planning decisions.

#### 6.3.2 Optimizing Limited Capacity

When capacity is limited, Edge Fabric may need to detour traffic to paths with comparatively worse performance. Edge Fabric can be extended to best use the limited capacity on the primary path by shifting prefixes and/or flows that measurements indicate are less likely to be impacted.

- **Decision Criteria:**
  - Edge Fabric can amend its decision criteria to prefer shifting prefixes that will experience little performance degradation on their detour path.
  - Higher priority flows can be routed over the constrained path. Front-end servers can assign predefined DSCP values to higher-priority flows, such as live video streams.
  - When Edge Fabric injects routes to shift default-routed traffic away from an overloaded interface, it can simultaneously inject routes into an alternate routing table to keep high-priority flows on the better-performing path.

Both IPFIX and sFlow samples collected by Traffic Collector include the DSCP field, making it possible for Edge Fabric to determine the rate of traffic marked with a given DSCP value and account for this in its projections.

### 7. Results on Production Traffic

#### 7.1 Deployment Status and Evaluation Datasets

We deployed Edge Fabric for all production traffic, detouring traffic to avoid overloading interfaces at Points of Presence (PoPs) around the world. Section 7.2 describes a two-day study in January 2017, predating our current stateless controller. This study used our earlier stateful controller, which did not automatically split large-volume prefixes. We believe our stateless controller achieves better utilization than the stateful one without negative side effects, but we have not yet formally evaluated it.

We are now deploying AltPath across our PoPs, but the results in Section 7.3 are from our initial trial deployment at four PoPs beginning in late 2016, chosen for their rich connectivity: one in North America (PoP-19 in §2), one in Europe (PoP-11), and two in Asia Pacific (PoPs-2, 16). Combined, these PoPs account for approximately 18% of the total traffic of the 20 PoPs. We do not currently use AltPath measurements automatically to inform production routing decisions, but Section 7.3 presents trial results on the impact and challenges of integrating performance into routing decisions.

We created two alternate path tables at each router, populated with BGP’s 2nd and 3rd preferred paths for all prefixes. Our 2016 measurements predate our current DSCP-based approach and instead assign flows to tables based on the flows’ destination ports. For each alternate routing table, we generated a distinct set of ports that matches approximately 0.5% of the total traffic and installed rules at PRs to route traffic destined towards these ports to one of the tables. To increase the number of measurements of alternate paths, we apply a 100x multiplier to the existing measurement sampling rate whenever a connection uses a port in the AltPath port set. With this multiplier, each alternate path receives 0.5% of traffic and has approximately 50% as many measurements as the primary path.

#### 7.2 Evaluating Capacity-Aware Routing

Does Edge Fabric achieve its primary goal of preventing congestion at edge interfaces while enabling efficient utilization? Edge Fabric prevents congestion by detouring traffic to alternate routes. During the study, non-overloaded alternate routes always existed, giving Edge Fabric options to avoid overloading interfaces. Transit providers can take detoured traffic to any destination, and the maximum instantaneous transit utilization observed at any individual PoP (sampled at one-minute intervals) during the study was 55%. Edge Fabric successfully prevented egress traffic from overloading egress interfaces, with no packet drops at an interface when Edge Fabric was not detouring traffic, nor in 99.9% of periods in which it was detouring. Figure 9 shows the utilization on these interfaces (relative to their detour thresholds) during these periods; Edge Fabric keeps utilization of preferred routes high even while avoiding drops, and utilization is below a safe threshold during periods in which Edge Fabric decides not to detour traffic.

How much traffic does Edge Fabric detour? Figure 10 shows the distribution of the fraction of time that Edge Fabric detoured traffic from each interface to avoid overloading it. During our evaluation period, Edge Fabric detoured traffic from 18% of interfaces at least once, and it detoured 5% of interfaces for at least half the period. Figure 11 shows how long each period of detouring lasts and how long the periods are between detours for a given (PoP, destination prefix). The median detour lasts 22 minutes, and 10% last at least 6 hours. Interestingly, the median time between detours is shorter—only 14 minutes—but the tail is longer, with a gap of more than 3 hours 36% of the time and a sizable fraction of gaps long enough to suggest detouring during a short daily peak. Figure 12 shows, over time, the fraction of traffic detoured across 20 PoPs and the fraction of traffic detoured at the PoP (in this set of 20) that detours the highest fraction of its traffic. The global and PoP detour volumes display diurnal patterns and remain a small fraction of overall traffic, leaving spare capacity to absorb detours, as PoPs always had at least 45% of their transit capacity free. Edge Fabric enables PoPs to dynamically detour traffic from interfaces that would otherwise become heavily overloaded (see Figure 6) by taking advantage of available capacity elsewhere.

#### 7.3 Evaluating Performance-Aware Routing

This section investigates how performance differs across paths to the same prefix and whether our system can use this information to select paths that outperform the ones BGP prefers. We use 7 days of measurements of production traffic from 4 PoPs where we deployed alternate path measurements (§7.1), including measurements of every prefix served from any of those PoPs, with a total of over 350M alternate path measurements to 20K ASes and an average of 8000 measurements per ⟨alternate path, destination prefix⟩.

What is the performance impact of using measurements of alternate paths to inform better decisions? We use the measurements to override BGP decisions for actual production user traffic at PoP-2. AltPath identified 400 destination prefixes for which an alternate route has a median latency at least 20ms faster (and loss was no worse) than BGP’s preferred path (§7.1). Edge Fabric consumed this information and injected overrides at the PoP, steering these flows to the better-performing paths.
