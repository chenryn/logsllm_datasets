### Expected Behavior
  * The app opens a child window using `window.open` method (`nativeWindowOpen` is set to `true`).
  * User clicks on a button that is supposed to bring the previously opened window to front. The app calls `win.focus()` on a said child window object.
  * The child window should appear above the main window.
### Actual Behavior
Nothing happens when `win.focus()` is called.
### Testcase Gist URL
_No response_
### Additional Information
When running (almost) the same code as a web app (in Chrome), the focus method
brings the window to the top.
