mong the 182 sites in the Alexa Top 500 sites in the
US that Lu et al. [35] were able to examine, 131 sites
(72%) allow frequent unsuccessful login attempts, and
another 28 sites (15%) can be easily locked out, leading
to denial of service attacks. This further suggests the
necessity of our work—understanding the strength of
Chinese passwords against online guessing.
3 Characteristics of Chinese passwords
We now investigate Chinese password characteristics,
most of which are underexplored. In addition, we discuss
weaknesses in previous major studies [26, 34].
3.1 Dataset and ethics consideration
Our empirical analysis employs six password datasets
from Chinese websites and three password datasets from
English websites. In total, these nine datasets consist of
106.3 million real-life passwords. As summarized in Ta-
ble 1, these nine datasets are different in terms of service,
language, culture, and size. The role of each dataset
will be speciﬁed in Sec. 4 when performing strength
comparison. They were hacked and made public on the
Internet between 2009 and 2012, and may be a bit old.
However, they can represent current passwords due to
two reasons. First, Bonneau has shown that “passwords
have changed only marginally since then (1990)” [7].
Second, the password ecosystem evolves very slowly.
A number of recent researches (see [21, 24, 55]) reveal
that password guidance and practices implemented on
leading sites have seldom changed over time.
We realize that though publicly available and widely
used in the literature [36, 52, 56], these datasets are pri-
vate data. Thus, we only report the aggregated statistical
information, and treat each individual account as conﬁ-
dential so that using it in our research will not increase
risk to the corresponding victim,
i.e., no personally
identiﬁable information can be learned. Furthermore,
these datasets may be exploited by attackers as cracking
dictionaries, while our use is both beneﬁcial for the
academic community to understand password choices
of Chinese netizens and for security administrators to
secure user accounts. As our datasets are all publicly
available, the results in this work are reproducible.
3.2 Data cleaning
We note that some original datasets (e.g., Rockyou and
Tianya) include un-necessary headers, descriptions, foot-
notes, password strings with len>100, etc. Thus, before
any exploration, we ﬁrst launch data cleaning. We
remove email addresses and user names from the original
data. As with [36], we also remove strings that in-
clude symbols beyond the 95 printable ASCII characters.
We further remove strings with len>30, because after
manually scrutinizing the original datasets, we ﬁnd that
these long strings do not seem to be generated by users,
but more likely by password managers or simply junk
information. Moreover, such unusually long passwords
are often beyond the scope of attackers who care about
cracking efﬁciency [4]. In all, the fraction of excluded
passwords is negligible (see the last column but two in
Table 1), yet this cleaning step uniﬁes the input of crack-
ing algorithms and simpliﬁes the later data processing.
We ﬁnd that either Tianya or 7k7k has been contam-
inated:
there is a non-negligible overlap between the
Tianya dataset and 7k7k dataset (i.e., 40.85% of 7k7k
and 24.62% of Tianya). More speciﬁcally, we were ﬁrst
puzzled by the fact that the password “111222tianya”
