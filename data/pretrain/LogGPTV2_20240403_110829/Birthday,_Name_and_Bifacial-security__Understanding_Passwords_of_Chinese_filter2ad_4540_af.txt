Among the 182 sites in the Alexa Top 500 in the US that Lu et al. [35] were able to examine, 131 (72%) allow frequent unsuccessful login attempts, and another 28 (15%) can be easily locked out, leading to potential denial of service attacks. This underscores the importance of our workâ€”understanding the strength of Chinese passwords against online guessing.

### 3. Characteristics of Chinese Passwords
We now investigate the characteristics of Chinese passwords, many of which have not been extensively explored. Additionally, we will discuss the weaknesses in previous major studies [26, 34].

#### 3.1 Dataset and Ethical Considerations
Our empirical analysis utilizes six password datasets from Chinese websites and three from English websites, totaling 106.3 million real-life passwords. As summarized in Table 1, these nine datasets vary in terms of the services they represent, language, cultural context, and size. The specific role of each dataset will be detailed in Section 4 when performing strength comparisons. These datasets were compromised and made public between 2009 and 2012, making them somewhat dated. However, they remain relevant for two reasons: First, Bonneau has shown that "passwords have changed only marginally since then (1990)" [7]. Second, the password ecosystem evolves very slowly. Recent research (see [21, 24, 55]) indicates that password guidance and practices on leading sites have remained largely unchanged over time.

We recognize that, although these datasets are publicly available and widely used in academic literature [36, 52, 56], they contain private data. Therefore, we only report aggregated statistical information and treat each individual account as confidential to ensure that our research does not increase the risk to the corresponding victims. Specifically, no personally identifiable information is disclosed. Furthermore, while these datasets could be exploited by attackers as cracking dictionaries, our use of them is beneficial for both the academic community, which seeks to understand the password choices of Chinese netizens, and for security administrators aiming to secure user accounts. Since all datasets are publicly available, the results of this study are reproducible.

#### 3.2 Data Cleaning
We observed that some original datasets (e.g., Rockyou and Tianya) include unnecessary headers, descriptions, footnotes, and password strings longer than 100 characters. Before any analysis, we conducted data cleaning. We removed email addresses and usernames from the original data. Following the approach of [36], we also removed strings containing symbols beyond the 95 printable ASCII characters. Additionally, we excluded strings longer than 30 characters, as manual scrutiny revealed that such long strings are unlikely to be generated by users and more likely to be created by password managers or contain junk information. Unusually long passwords are often outside the scope of attackers who prioritize cracking efficiency [4]. The fraction of excluded passwords is negligible (see the second-to-last column in Table 1), but this cleaning step unifies the input for cracking algorithms and simplifies subsequent data processing.

We found that the Tianya and 7k7k datasets have been contaminated, with a significant overlap: 40.85% of the 7k7k dataset and 24.62% of the Tianya dataset are identical. Specifically, we were initially puzzled by the presence of the password "111222tianya" in both datasets.
