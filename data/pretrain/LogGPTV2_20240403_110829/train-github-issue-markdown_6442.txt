In documentation it is written:
        Plugins run before Presets.
        Plugin ordering is first to last.
        Preset ordering is reversed (last to first).
I wrote my own plugin which works with const and let. It works good, but when
I use "es2015" preset, my plugin does not work because all const and let
become var. Why does my plugin run after presets?  
Here is my babel config:
    {
      "presets": [
        "es2015"
      ],
      "plugins": [
        "./babel-plugin-transform-const-name"
      ]
    }
And I use "babel-cli": "^6.18.0"
