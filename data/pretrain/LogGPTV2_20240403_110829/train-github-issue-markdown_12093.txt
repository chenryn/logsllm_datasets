While the general direction are users moving from NodeJS into Deno, for me, I
enjoy Deno modules while working on a bigger NodeJS/TS project that consumes
npm packages.
I would like to import my Deno modules back into NodeJS while retaining type
declaration. Steps that I have to do now are:
  1. Copy a.. *.ts files to a temp dir.
  2. Remove all `.ts` from `import`s .
  3. Recursively resolve all externally loaded modules.
There's also `deno bundle`, which is useful, but it does not generate type
declaration file. It would be nice if there's `deno bundle --declaration`,
similar to `tsc --declaration`.
What does the community think?
