### Container Instances Security Best Practices

| Description & Rationale | Control Severity | Automated Fix Script |
|-------------------------|------------------|----------------------|
| **Public IP Address and Port Usage**<br>Public IP addresses provide direct internet access, which can expose containers to various types of attacks over the public network. Carefully review the use of public IP addresses and ports. | High | Yes | No |
| **Trustworthy Container Images**<br>Ensure that all container images, including nested images, are sourced from a trusted provider. Running untrusted images can compromise the integrity of your infrastructure and lead to security breaches. | High | Yes | No |
| **Secure Registry for Container Images**<br>Host container images in a registry with robust authentication, authorization, and data protection mechanisms. Using an untrusted registry can result in running compromised images, leading to potential data loss. | High | Yes | No |
| **Container Group Trust Boundaries**<br>Ensure that all containers within a group trust each other. Containers in the same group can monitor each other's traffic and access the host OS file system. Therefore, do not mix containers across different trust boundaries within the same group. | High | Yes | No |

By following these best practices, you can enhance the security and integrity of your containerized applications.
