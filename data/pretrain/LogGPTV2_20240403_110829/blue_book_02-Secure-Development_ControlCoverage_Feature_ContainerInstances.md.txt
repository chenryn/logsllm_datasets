ContainerInstances
Description & RationaleControlSeverityAutomatedFix ScriptUse of public IP address and ports should be carefully reviewedPublic IP address provides direct access over the internet exposing the container to all type of attacks over the public network.HighYesNo
Make sure container images (including nested images) are from a trustworthy sourceIf a container runs an untrusted image (or an untrusted nested image), it can violate integrity of the infrastructure and lead to all types of security attacks.HighYesNo
Make sure container images are hosted on a trustworthy registry that has strong authentication, authorization and data protection mechanismsIf a container image is served from an untrusted registry, the image itself may not be trustworthy. Running such a compromised image can lead to loss of sensitive enterprise data.HighYesNo
A container group must contain only containers which trust each otherContainers hosted in the same container group can monitor traffic of other containers within the group and can also access the file system of the host OS. Hence a container group must not host containers which do not trust each other. In other words, do not mix containers across trust boundaries in the same group.HighYesNo
