User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Windows user have full effective rights from his computer We have a Windows 2003 single domain.
A share located on a server has full rights for every authenticated users.
Under this share, a folder is read-only for everyone (except buitlin\Administrators group).
Everything work as intended.

I discovered one user who, from his Windows 7 pro workstation, has full access on this folder. He can do whatever he wants. If he log on another computer, he has read-only access.
When I display effective rights for this user FROM his workstation, I see he has every boxes checked. When I display the same thing from the server, I see correct rights.

This user belong to the builtin\Administrator group of his computer (we have to. You know, some software are very very bad).

Any idea about the fact this user has full rights only from his workstation ?

Assistant: The fact that the user only gets this extra access from a single workstation, and doesn't get it from any other is an interesting diagnostic. It tells me that there is something up with that workstation that is causing this to happen.

One check that is worth doing is verifying what user he is logging in as. You can do this from  the Current Sessions listing in Computer Manager. It may take some work, but verify he is logging in as himself. If that doesn't work, have him create a file on that share and check to see who owns it. This should shed some light on the problem.

If it turns out he's logging in as the wrong user somehow, it could be that his workstation isn't actually domained and there is a misalignment on the username translation. On the 2003 server's security settings, the 'share model' may be set to allow unknown users to emulate a specific user.
