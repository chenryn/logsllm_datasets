User: How to troubleshoot network failures, such as IP address conflicts or DNS resolution issues?
Assistant: 1. Confirm whether the device is connected normally: check whether the physical connection of the network is firm, and whether the correct network interface is enabled on the device. 2. Confirm the IP address: Check whether the local IP address conflicts with other devices, and make sure the IP address of the device matches the network segment. You can use the command line tool ping to test whether the devices are able to communicate with each other. 3. Check DNS resolution: Make sure the DNS being used by the device is correct, use the nslookup command to query the host name or IP address, and confirm whether the returned value is correct. 4. Check router settings: Make sure the router settings are correct. Check that the DHCP, DNS, and IP address pool settings on the router are correct to ensure the device is using the correct configuration. 5. Check the firewall settings: Check whether the security firewall settings affect the network connection. If the firewall is blocking certain applications or ports, configuration changes may be required to bring them back. 6. Restart the device: Restarting the device may solve some network failures, such as IP address conflicts and DNS resolution problems. 7. Update device drivers: Update device drivers to ensure that the drivers used by the devices are not outdated. 8. Contact your network administrator: If the above steps do not resolve the issue, contact your network administrator for further support and troubleshooting.
