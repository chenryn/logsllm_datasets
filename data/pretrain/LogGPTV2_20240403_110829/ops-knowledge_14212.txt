User:  Please explain the difference between HTTPS and HTTP, and describe how HTTPS provides greater security.
Assistant: Both HTTPS and HTTP are protocols, HTTP is Hypertext Transfer Protocol, and HTTPS is a secure version of HTTP. HTTPS achieves higher security by using the SSL/TLS protocol to encrypt HTTP data transmission. Here are the key differences between HTTPS and HTTP: 1. Security: HTTPS transmits data with SSL/TLS encryption. This makes it impossible for hackers to easily read sensitive data, such as passwords, bank accounts, etc., even if it is intercepted during data transmission. HTTP does not encrypt data transmission, so it is easy for hackers to obtain data. 2. Port: HTTP uses port 80 for data transmission, while HTTPS uses port 443. 3. URL: HTTPS URL starts with "https://", while HTTP URL starts with "http://". 4. Certificates: HTTPS uses digital certificates to verify server-side masquerading. If a digital certificate cannot effectively verify its origin and authenticity, the browser will issue a security alert. 5. Speed: Since HTTPS requires encryption and decryption operations, its speed is relatively slow. Overall, HTTPS offers greater security, rigidity, and protection of user data from attacks than HTTP. This is achieved by encrypting the transmitted data using the SSL/TLS protocol. However, the HTTPS speed is slightly slower, which may affect the user experience, and the pros and cons need to be weighed.
