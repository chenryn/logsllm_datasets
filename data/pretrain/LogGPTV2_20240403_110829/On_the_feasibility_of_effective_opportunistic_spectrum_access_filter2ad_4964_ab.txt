the sweeping time. Note that the sweeping times of our datasets
(1.8 seconds for the RWTH dataset and 0.65 seconds for the UCSB
dataset) are two orders of magnitude smaller than previous mea-
surements of 75 seconds [7]. We show in Section 6 that such ﬁne-
grained measurement is required to capture useful statistics of spec-
trum availability and usability.
Second, we capture the effect where a primary user returns to the
channel in the middle of a slot in our calculations of the primary
user disruption rate. Speciﬁcally, if an idle slot is followed by an
occupied slot, then the primary user is likely to arrive in the middle
of the ﬁrst slot. If the secondary user decides to transmit in the ﬁrst
slot, we ﬂag this slot as creating a disruption to the primary user.
We compute the primary user disruption rate as the ratio of primary
user busy blocks that suffer any disruption [14].
Finally, we assume that secondary users’ sensing is accurate, and
that multiple secondary users coordinate their access to avoid trans-
mission collision. Since our focus is on studying the impact of
spectrum usage patterns of original owners, we abstract multiple
coexisting secondary users into a single secondary link. The de-
sign and overhead of optimal spectrum sensing and coordination
protocols, although important, are out of the scope of this paper.
We refer the reader to [3, 6, 18, 26, 27] for more details on cooper-
ative spectrum sensing and sharing.
3. SPECTRUM AVAILABILITY ANALYSIS
The performance of opportunistic spectrum access depends heav-
ily on the sustained availability of unused spectrum. In this sec-
tion, using the RWTH data set, we examine in detail the availabil-
ity of spectrum, its dependency on frequencies and locations, as
well as its temporal dynamics. In total, we analyzed a one-week
spectrum usage patterns (busy or idle) on each of the 5622 fre-
quency channels. In the following, we ﬁrst describe our ﬁndings on
overall spectrum availability across frequencies and locations, and
then present observed temporal dynamics on instantaneous spec-
trum availability.
3.1 Overall Spectrum Availability
We deﬁne Spectrum Availability (SA) as the percentage of mea-
sured intervals where a channel is not occupied by existing owners
in a given time frame. While each service has its own operating
channel width, in this study we treat each 200kHz measurement
band as a single spectrum channel.
Figure 2 plots the spectrum availability measured at the NED lo-
cation, for each of 5622 spectrum channels corresponding to the 15
selected service bands listed in Table 1, averaged over a period of
one week. It shows that many spectrum channels are either com-
pletely free or partially-used. Interestingly, for some of the services
(e.g. TV3, GSM1800DL and UMTSDL), the spectrum availability
varies signiﬁcantly across channels within the same service. To
further examine the impact of measurement location, Figure 3(a)
shows the spectrum availability measured at the three locations
(NED, GER1, and GER2), averaged over a period of one week and
across channels within each service band.
We make two key observations from these results. First, for all
three locations, a signiﬁcant portion of allocated spectrum is avail-
able for secondary devices. Second, the availability varies signif-
icantly across frequencies. Very low frequencies (TV1, Aviation,
Marine, TV2) are heavily occupied, while others experience only
light and moderate usage. The cellular uplink bands (GSM900UL,
GSM1800UL, UMTSUL) are mostly idle because their signals are
signiﬁcantly weaker than those of downlink transmissions, and are
thus harder to detect even using high-end spectrum analyzers. Nev-
ertheless, we use these uplink measurements to examine oppor-
tunistic access, assuming that secondary users take extra precau-
tions on these bands to avoid disrupting primary users, e.g. by low-
ering their transmit power.
After examining each channel in detail, we found that out of
5622 channels analyzed, 1176 channels are partially occupied, i.e.
whose average spectrum availability is within [0.05, 0.95], and 3181
channels are idle, i.e. whose availability is greater than 0.95. In
Figure 3(b), we plot the cumulative distribution of the spectrum
availability across these partially occupied channels, and see that

their availability is evenly distributed between 0.05 and 0.95. In the
rest of the paper, we will focus on these partially occupied channels
for which we must rely on opportunistic spectrum access to extract
unused spectrum.
3.2 Dynamics of Available Spectrum
In this section, we investigate the temporal dynamics of spec-
trum availability. To understand both long- and short-term trends,
we analyze the dynamics at two different granularity levels. To un-
derstand day-to-day trends, we start from dividing traces into half-
hour segments and compute for each segment the average spectrum
availability. Figure 4(a) plots the resulting spectrum availability
observed over 6 days on three selected GSM1800DL channels with
intermediate spectrum availability, one for each location. In this
case, spectrum availability varies signiﬁcantly over time, and dis-
plays a weak 1-day periodicity.
Next we investigate the availability dynamics at the granularity
of the measurement interval (1.8s). Figure 4(b) shows a 1 minute
snapshot of the spectrum occupancy on all the partially available
GSM1800DL channels. A white strip in the ﬁgure indicates that the
corresponding channel during this time period is idle. This result
clearly demonstrates that the available spectrum is fragmented and
scattered across time. A more precise view of the channel idle/busy
durations is shown in Figure 5, for NED and GER1. It represents a
randomly selected GSM1800DL channel for a period of 1 hour be-
tween 11AM and noon. In this example, the channel busy duration
varies between 1.8 seconds and 20 seconds, while the idle duration
varies signiﬁcantly between 1.8 seconds to 100 seconds. The large
variance in idle durations, however, poses signiﬁcant challenges to
secondary devices, making it harder to access and utilize a chan-
nel while respecting a ﬁxed limit of disruption to original owners.
We examine this challenge and its impact in greater detail next in
Section 4.
4. PERFORMANCE OF OPPORTUNISTIC
SPECTRUM ACCESS
Our analysis of real world measurements has demonstrated the
ample scope for opportunistic spectrum access.
In this section,
we investigate its performance in terms of “extracting” the unused
spectrum without disrupting original owners. As illustrated in Fig-
ure 1, secondary devices sense and access spectrum in a slotted
manner. Without knowing exactly when the primary user will re-
turn, secondary devices must take great precaution and occasion-
ally give up using an idle channel. As a result, they cannot extract
all the available spectrum. Using the RWTH dataset, we seek to
understand how much spectrum a secondary device can actually
obtain.
Speciﬁcally, our analysis answers three key questions:
• What is the rate of spectrum extraction? Can statistical knowl-
edge on primary user spectrum usage patterns improve the
performance, and if so, by how much?
• Is the average spectrum availability a reliable predictor of the
amount of spectrum extracted?
• What is the usability of the extracted spectrum? How long
must a secondary user wait to access a channel and how long
does the access last?
In the following, we ﬁrst describe the access strategies used in
our analysis, and then address these questions.
4.1 Access Strategies
Given the primary user disruption limit η and the probability
density function of primary user idle duration, prior work has de-
veloped optimal access strategies for opportunistic spectrum ac-
cess [14]. A secondary user x senses the channel at the start of
an access slot t. If the channel is busy, x does nothing and waits
till the next slot. If the channel is idle, x estimates the risk of ac-
cessing the current slot, using its past channel observations, the
primary user idle duration statistics f (·) and the primary user dis-
∗(t), the
ruption limit η. Based on this risk factor, x computes q
∗(t) can
probability of accessing the channel at time t. Formally, q

), x uses the channel. If the risk is close to the col-
lision probability (g(t) = γ
), x uses the channel with probability
derived from f (·) and η [14], otherwise, x does not access the

p
channel. It has been proved that using small access slots, the above
strategy is optimal and satisﬁes the primary user disruption limit.
The detailed derivations and proof can be found from [14].

(averaged over 30 minutes) varies signiﬁcantly over 5 weekdays, on randomly selected
GSM1800DL channels (one per location). (b) The per 1.8s availability of a 1-minute snap-

white strips, is scattered randomly across time.
Figure 5: Cumulative distributions of
channel idle and busy period on a ran-
domly selected channel in an one hour
period. Large variation in idle dura-
tion poses signiﬁcant challenges for op-
portunistic access. The GER2 result is
similar to the NED result and thus omit-
ted.
We apply this optimal strategy to create two practical opportunis-
tic access schemes:
• No knowledge-based Access (NKA). This scheme requires
no knowledge about primary user usage patterns. Secondary
devices will access a channel with a probability η (the pri-
mary user disruption limit) when sensing it idle, leading to an
extraction rate around η. This is the optimal result if the pri-
mary user idle time follows the exponential distribution [14].
• Statistical knowledge-based Access (SKA).
It assumes that
secondary devices have the exact statistical distribution of
primary user idle time, f (·). Such knowledge is either pro-
vided by original owners or 3rd party or built by secondary
devices via online/ofﬂine learning.
We note that secondary users can schedule channel access to uti-
lize all available spectrum if and only if they can completely pre-
dict each primary user’s spectrum usage events. This ideal scheme,
however, is only feasible when the primary user displays a deter-
ministic access pattern, which we did not ﬁnd in our measurement
datasets. Thus we did not consider it in our analysis.
The SKA scheme requires an accurate statistical distribution of
primary user idle time. Results in Section 3 show that the distribu-
tion varies signiﬁcantly over time, especially within the same day.
To make a fair evaluation, we apply time-series analysis to segment
traces of each frequency channel into multiple time segments, each
displaying stable availability [15]. The results show that most seg-
ments are roughly 1-2 hours in length. We then extract the statisti-
cal distribution f (·) of primary user idle time in each segment and
use it to implement and evaluate SKA in the same segment.
4.2 Spectrum Extraction Rate
For each partially-used channel, we measure the spectrum ex-
traction rate as the ratio between the amount of spectrum actually
obtained by secondary devices and the amount of available spec-
trum. By default, the primary user disruption limit η=0.1.
SKA vs. NKA.
Figure 6 plots, for each of the 15 services,
the one-week average of the spectrum extraction rate. Without
any knowledge on primary user idle time, NKA’s extraction rate is
roughly 10% (due to η = 0.1). SKA, on the other hand, improves
the extraction rate by 2–3 times. This demonstrates the beneﬁts of
having statistical knowledge of the primary user access patterns.
A disappointing observation is that even with accurate statisti-
cal knowledge on primary user access patterns, the average extrac-
tion rate is only 15–35%. To further explore this problem, we also
plot in Figure 7 the cumulative distribution of SKA’s extraction rate
among all the segments of partially occupied channels. Across all
locations, the median extraction rate is 19%, and 80% of the seg-
ments can produce no more than 37% extraction rate.
The low effectiveness can be attributed to two factors. 1) The
spectrum usage patterns are highly random and hard to predict, so
without a reliable estimation on channel idle duration, secondary
devices are forced to be overly conservative; or 2) the access slot
used by secondary devices is too large, forcing them to being overly
conservative. The ﬁrst reason has been conﬁrmed by the highly ran-
dom distribution of primary user idle time, shown in Figure 5. A
related study has also conﬁrmed the difﬁculty in predicting primary
user access patterns [23]. The second reason, however, is impos-
sible to verify without the ground truth on primary user spectrum
usage patterns – the RWTH dataset is measured at the same 1.8s
intervals, preventing us from pinpointing the exact primary user

segments for each service over a week. For GER1 and GER2, some services have no data because they do not have any partially-
available frequency channels. NKA only extracts 10% of available spectrum due to the 0.1 primary user disruption limit. SKA
increases the extraction rate to 15-35%.
