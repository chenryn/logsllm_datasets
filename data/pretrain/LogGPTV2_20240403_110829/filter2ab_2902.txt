**ATT&CK ID:** T1583.005  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Botnet

Adversaries may acquire, lease, or rent a network of compromised systems, known as a botnet, to facilitate their malicious activities. A botnet is a collection of infected devices that can be remotely controlled to execute coordinated tasks. Adversaries often purchase subscriptions to existing botnets from booter/stresser services, enabling them to leverage the botnet's capabilities for various follow-on activities. These activities may include large-scale phishing campaigns or Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.
