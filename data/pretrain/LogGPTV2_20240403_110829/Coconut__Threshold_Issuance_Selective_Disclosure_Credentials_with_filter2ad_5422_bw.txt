Certainly! Here is a more polished and professional version of the provided text:

---

Let \( (v, w_1, \ldots, w_q) \) be noted, and set:
\[
(x, y_1, \ldots, y_q) = (v(0), w_1(0), \ldots, w_q(0))
\]

Issue a secret key \( \text{sk}_i \) to each authority \( i \in [1, \ldots, n] \) as follows:
\[
\text{sk}_i = (x_i, y_{i,1}, \ldots, y_{i,q}) = (v(i), w_1(i), \ldots, w_q(i))
\]

Publish their verification key \( \text{vk}_i \) computed as:
\[
\text{vk}_i = (g^2, \alpha_i, \beta_{i,1}, \ldots, \beta_{i,q}) = (g^2, g^{x_i}, g^{y_{i,1}}, \ldots, g^{y_{i,q}})
\]

**Credential Issuance (IssueCred)**: This process is composed of three algorithms.

1. **PrepareBlindSign**:
   - **Input**: Attributes \( m_1, \ldots, m_q \) and a policy \( \varphi \).
   - **Output**: A tuple \( (\delta, \Lambda, \varphi) \).

   The user generates an El-Gamal key pair \( (\delta, \gamma = g_1^\delta) \). They then pick a random \( o \in \mathbb{F}_p \) and compute the commitment \( \text{cm} \) and the group element \( h \in G_1 \) as follows:
   \[
   \text{cm} = g_1^o \prod_{j=1}^q h(m_j)
   \]
   \[
   h = H(\text{cm})
   \]

   Next, they choose random values \( (k_1, \ldots, k_q) \in \mathbb{F}_p^q \) and compute an El-Gamal encryption of each \( m_j \) for all \( j \in [1, \ldots, q] \):
   \[
   c_j = \text{Enc}(h \cdot m_j) = (g_1^{k_j}, \gamma^{k_j} \cdot h \cdot m_j)
   \]

   Finally, they output \( (\delta, \Lambda = (\gamma, \text{cm}, c_j, \pi_s), \varphi) \) for all \( j \in [1, \ldots, q] \), where \( \pi_s \) is defined by:
   \[
   \pi_s = \text{NIZK}\{(d, m_1, \ldots, m_q, o, k_1, \ldots, k_q) : \gamma = g_1^d \land \text{cm} = g_1^o \prod_{j=1}^q h(m_j) \land c_j = \text{Enc}(h \cdot m_j)\}
   \]
