(x, y1, . . . yq) = (v(0), w1(0), . . . , wq(0))
Issue a secret key ski to each authority i ∈ [1, . . . , n] as
below:
ski = (xi, yi,1, . . . , yi,q) = (v(i), w1(i), . . . , wq(i))

and publish their veriﬁcation key vki computed as follows:
vki = (g2, αi, βi,1, . . . , βi,q)) = (g2, gxi

O IssueCred(m1, . . . , mq, φ) → (σ): Credentials issuance
is composed of three algorithms:
O PrepareBlindSign(m1, . . . , mq, φ) → (d, Λ, φ): The
users generate an El-Gamal key-pair (d, γ = gd
1 ); pick
a random o ∈ Fp compute the commitment cm and the
group element h ∈ G1 as follows:

and
h = H(cm)
q(cid:89)j=1
Pick at random (k1, . . . , kq) ∈ Fq
p and compute an El-
Gamal encryption of each mj for ∀j ∈ [1, . . . , q] as
below:
cj = Enc(hmj ) = (gkj

Output (d, Λ = (γ, cm, cj, πs), φ) ∀j ∈ [1, . . . , q], where
πs is deﬁned by:
