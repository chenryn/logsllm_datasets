The changes from 2.0.3 to 2.0.4 has cause some side effects. In 2.0.3 the
PABPP would use beanFactory.getBean(..) to obtain the EMFs. In 2.0.4 it first
beanFactory.isTypeMatch(..)
When the EMF has not yet been created in the context,
AbstractEntityMangagerFactoryBean.getObjectType will return
EntityManagerFactory.class, but PABPP compares the class against
EntityManagerFactoryInfo.class. Hence due the abitrary ordering of bean
creation most of my EMFs fail to be discovered by the PABPP.
PABPP.findNamedEntityManagerFactory(..) returns EntityManagerFactory (not
EMFInfo), so why does it check for the EMFInfo.class?
I cannot simply have PABPP depend on the LCEMFBs because it defined in a
generic config file, where the LCEMFBs are defined in component specific
config files.
