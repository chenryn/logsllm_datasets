I guess it's a bit late now, but couldn't have not only the runtime be written
in Rust but also every other API and be compiled to WASM? in the longer term
it would translate in faster start-up times better more predictable
performance. I imagine the community could later create a WASM version of the
std and any other API right? or are there major blockers that make it hard to
do?
