User: Please list common modules for file manipulation in Python and give a brief explanation of them.
Assistant: 1. os module: Provides many functions that interact with the operating system to manage files and directories, including operations such as creating, deleting, moving, and copying files. 2. shutil module: used to handle advanced file operations, provides functions for copying, moving, renaming and deleting files and directories, and can also package files into zip or tar files. 3. The glob module: used to find file path names that match a specific pattern, and can match file names based on wildcards. 4. pathlib module: Introduced in Python3.4, it provides an object-oriented file path operation method, which is more concise and easy to read than the os module, and can replace some operations in the os module. 5. codecs module: handles common text encoding and decoding operations, and can convert files from one encoding format to another encoding format. 6. The json module: used to parse and generate JSON data, can serialize Python objects into JSON strings, or deserialize JSON strings into Python objects. 7. csv module: used to read and write CSV files, you can format list or dictionary data into CSV format, or read data from CSV files. 8. argparse module: used to parse command line parameters, which can simplify the parameter parsing and document generation work of command line programs. 9. zipfile module: used to process ZIP files, you can create and read ZIP files, or add, delete and modify files to existing ZIP files.
