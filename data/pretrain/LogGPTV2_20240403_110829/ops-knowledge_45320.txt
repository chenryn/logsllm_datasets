I was attempting to build the source code for Caravel and followed the instructions to install the front-end dependencies using npm. However, when I ran `python setup.py install`, I encountered the following error:

```
warning: no previously-included files matching '.pyo' found anywhere in distribution
warning: no previously-included files matching '.pyd' found anywhere in distribution
numpy/core/src/npymath/ieee754.c.src:7:29: fatal error: npy_math_common.h: No such file or directory
#include "npy_math_common.h"
```

I also tried running the command with `python3`, but the issue persisted. My environment is Ubuntu 14.04.4 LTS.

### Solution:
I realized that I had missed installing some necessary numpy libraries. After executing the following commands, the issue was resolved:

```bash
sudo apt-get install python-numpy
sudo apt-get install libsasl2-dev python-dev libldap2-dev libssl-dev
```

After installing these packages, Caravel is now running without any issues.
