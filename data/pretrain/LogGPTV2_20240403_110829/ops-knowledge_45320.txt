User: I am trying to build the source code of caravel.
Following the instructions I have installed the front end dependencies using npm.
on python setup.py install I am getting error:

warning: no previously-included files matching '.pyo' found anywhere
in distribution warning: no previously-included files matching '.pyd'
found anywhere in distribution
numpy/core/src/npymath/ieee754.c.src:7:29: fatal error:
npy_math_common.h: No such file or directory  #include
"npy_math_common.h"

I tried running with python3.
I am running this on Ubuntu 14.04.4 LTS
Assistant: Well.. I missed on installing some numpy libraries.
sudo apt-get install python-numpy
sudo apt-get install libsasl2-dev python-dev libldap2-dev libssl-dev
After installing the above pakages my issue got resolved.
Caravel is running fine.
