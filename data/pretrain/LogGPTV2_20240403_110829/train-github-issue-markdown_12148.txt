A gradient snippet was recently added to the CSS snippets.
This has an incorrect syntax for the unprefixed version. When it was
standardised the angles were changed so that the old "top" keyword (as used in
the snippet) maps to "to bottom" in the standard syntax. "left" becomes to
right, and so on.
The current code will create a gradient that is flipped for browsers that use
the unprefixed version.
