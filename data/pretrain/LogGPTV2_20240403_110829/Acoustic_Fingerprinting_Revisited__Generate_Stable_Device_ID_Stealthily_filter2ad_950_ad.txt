ture slowly. For example, the feature may be different in different
air humidity, because the vapor in the air may inﬂuence the vibra-
tion of coil. We want to compensate this drawback by postulating
a ﬁngerprint slow updating technique. We update the ﬁngerprint
in the database if the ﬁngerprint can be distinguished but a small
constant offset detected, such that the slow changes can be com-
pensated.
Upheavals The stability experiment was conducted in ofﬁce only.
But we know that a phone may encounters range of situations,
which may change the feature of the phone rapidly. For example, a
sudden dropping to ﬂoor may change the mechanical feature of the
speaker and thereby change the frequency response. An accidently
dropping to water may change the feature too. We haven’t come up
with practical solution to identify such an upheaval.
7.4 Interference from background noises
Although our proposed scheme has a special design on frequency
combinations at about seventy discrete frequency points, it could
still fail to extract unique device IDs under environments saturated
with high power noise signals, like train station, crowding restau-
rant, etc.
To overcome such limitation and make our method work even
under low Signal-Noise-Ratio (SNR), we may try to use some ad-
vanced methods borrowing from communication area, and one ex-
ample is “Spread-spectrum Communication” [9]. Spread spectrum
communication generally makes use of a sequential noise-like sig-
nal structure to spread the normally narrow band information sig-
nal over a relatively wide band of frequencies.
It can even do
frequency-hopping where information is sent following a sequence
of pseudo random frequencies. The receiver can reproduce the
same pseudo random sequence ,thus it is able to correlate the re-
ceived signals to retrieve the transmitted information [9].
Inspired by the spread-spectrum communication, we can mod-
ify the scheme accordingly. In each effective frequency point from
14 kHz to 21 kHz, the original mono tone sine wave is modulated
with a pseudo random sequence, such that the energy originally
in the frequency point spreads to a frequency range, the width of
which is decided by the rate of the pseudo random sequence gen-
eration. As the result, the distributed energy decreases the energy
density sharply while the overall signal energy keeps unchanged,
since the consumed bandwidth increases. Later, the recorded audio
data will be sent to a band pass ﬁlter and de-spread to recover the
sine wave. Finally, the recovered sine wave at each frequency point
has different amplitude because the speaker attenuates the signals,
which reﬂects the features of that speaker.
7.5 Device ID for smart phones of different
models or from different manufacturers
In this paper, we only evaluated the features of 50 OEM speakers
for Samsung Galaxy S3. All the speakers are coming from the same
assembly line with continuous Serial Number printed on them. We
did not extend our study to smart phones from different manufac-
turers because of the assumption that speakers from different man-
ufacturers are generally easier to be differentiated, which has been
conﬁrmed by previous work [19].
Even in the worst case that above assumption fails, we would
propose to incorporate other hardware feature or information into
the device ID. For example, the CPU type, memory capacity, op-
erating system version, etc. According to previous studies, an app
can get all above information without requesting any special per-
mission [45].
7.6 Detection of audio ﬁngerprinting opera-
tion
Although an Android application based on our proposed scheme
can disguise itself as a legitimate one by requesting microphone
accessing permission for other legal use, it is still possible to de-
tect if such application is trying to perform audio ﬁngerprinting
or not. For example, it is required to do Fast Fourier Transform
on recorded response in order to generate audio stimulus, so with
some code analysis, it is possible to detect the existence of such
suspicious operations though it can be hidden into the equalizer
processing as if it is enhancing the audio quality. However, if an
application’s original function include FFT operation, then the de-
tection problem is still difﬁcult to handle.
8. RELATED WORK
Software Fingerprint In terms of software feature, many browser
conﬁguration information can be exploited to differentiate devices,
such as User Agent, fonts installed, plugin information, benchmark
etc [22, 33, 14, 40]. Besides the browser, OS version, Kernel ver-
sion and application list can all be utilized to distinguish devices.
Different implementation to the networking protocol can also be
exploited to generate ﬁngerprint, such as TCP initial window size,
IP header ID sequence generation [25, 38, 26].
Hardware Fingerprint In terms of hardware feature, a lot of
works have been devoted to identifying the devices by exploiting
minute differences of the signal produced by the component of the
phone. For example, wireless NIC can be distinguished by exploit-
ing feature from RF signal emitted by the transmitter [42, 23, 20,
13, 15, 17]. However they cannot be promoted to Internet track-
ing usage, since there may be no direct physical link between user
and tracer. Data collected from the accelerometer can also be used
to distinguish users in [21] with coarse precision without active
stimulation. Photos taken by cameras can also be distinguished by
pattern and noise [31].
438Scheme proposed in [19] also leveraged feature of speaker em-
bedded in the phone to identify users. However, they haven’t pointed
out how large scale their scheme can be applied to. Besides, the ro-
bustness of the cepstral feature is not evaluated, which casts doubt
on the feasibility of long-term tracking. What’s more, no practi-
cal method has been postulated in his scheme in terms of hiding
the identiﬁcation process, while playing a clip of audible music as
stimulation will inevitably attract users’ attention.
Location Stealing Many researchers have also focused on po-
sition stealing method in android devices without corresponding
permission. Zhou et al. have studied how to infer the location with
public information provided by android without special permission
in [45]. Han et al. postulated that accelerometers in smartphones
can be utilized to infer location in [27]. Lester et al stated in [30]
that techniques have been found to determine if two phones are be-
ing carried by the same person. In [34], the author have raised a
kind of probabilistic method for positioning to mobile devices in
the pocket without GPS information.
9. CONCLUSION
This paper exhibited that there are differences between speaker
individuals of the smart phone, which is reﬂected on the differences
between the response curves. It is the differences that enable ap-
plications to generate unique identity according to response curve.
The identity proves to be eligible as a kind of long-term tracking
proof, for its’ stability. The identity also proves to be entropy suf-
ﬁcient to incorporate all the phones in the world. In terms of anti-
interference, both practical experiments and theoretical analysis are
conducted to show that the scheme works in common situations ex-
cept what with annoying high power noise. Besides the identity,
more seriously, the location of the device may be exposed, resulted
from the narrow broadcasting range of the sound wave. To calculate
the error rate, we analyzed the distribution model of the similarity,
which is calculated by ﬁtting the similarity between identities to
some probabilistic model and choosing the most overlapped one.
We decide the entropy according to the size of the distinguishable
device pool calculated by the error rate.
