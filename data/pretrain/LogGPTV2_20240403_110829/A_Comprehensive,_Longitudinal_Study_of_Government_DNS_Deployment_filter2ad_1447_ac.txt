deployments using our active data collection. Figure 9 pro-
vides the distribution of authoritative nameservers among the
domains we studied. Of all the domains considered, 98.4%
used at least two authoritative nameservers, and for over half
(109) of the countries considered, no domain in its dgov used
less than two nameservers. In contrast, for 15 countries, at
least 10% of responsive the domains used a single authoritative
nameserver. Four of these (Bolivia, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso,
and the UAE) had fewer than 10 responsive domains of which
only a few (three or fewer) were d1N S. Of the other 11, in three
cases (Indonesia, Kyrgyzstan, and Mexico), over half of the
d1N S had no response from their authoritative nameservers,
suggesting these domains are no longer in use, but have not
been removed from parent zones.
Using active DNS lookups, we examined how common it
is for d1N S to represent stale records. We consider that if
we could not obtain a response from a domain’s authoritative
nameservers, the domain is no longer used and the NS records

that
over 85% of domains studied used authoritative nameservers
with IP addresses in multiple /24 preﬁxes, while only 72%
of domains actually had servers in different networks. The
discrepancy between the results in this work and ours may
be attributed to the fact
the other work focused on
popular domains (the Alexa Top 1 Million), and domains at
the second level of the DNS hierarchy. Intuitively, popular
domains and those higher in the hierarchy require more robust
ADNS deployments than do less popular domains or those
lower in the hierarchy. We see in our own results that the
percent of domains with authoritative nameservers resolving
to IPs in multiple /24 preﬁxes is higher for domains at the
second level of the DNS hierarchy (87.1%) than for those at
the third through ﬁfth levels (less than 80%). It is difﬁcult
to separate patterns for domains at different
levels from
those of different governments, though. Delegation strategies
cause some countries to dominate the set of domains in
our dataset at different
levels. For example, 16% of the
domains in our dataset at the third level of our DNS hierar-
chy were in gov.cn, and 53% of those at the fourth level
were in gov.br. Domains in different countries tended to
have different deployment styles or use different providers.
For the responsive subdomains of gov.cn, over half were
using authoritative nameservers under hichina.com (38%),
xincache.com (19%) and dns-diy.com (10.8%). In con-
trast, for domains in gov.br the maximum percent of domains
using any given provider was much smaller: only 6% using
authoritative nameservers belonging to Hostgator. Dissecting
patterns in ADNS deployment strategies further is beyond
the scope of this work. Overall, we observe high levels of
replication, although the percent of authoritative nameservers
per domain in different networks appears to be relatively low
compared to that of popular domains.
B. Third-Party DNS Providers
As more domains have their authoritative nameservers man-
aged by third-party DNS service providers,
the degree to
which these domains depend on such providers has become an
increasingly important question to answer. Questions regarding
DNS providers are, in a way, an extension of those regarding
nameserver replication. A single domain may have multiple
nameservers in diverse locations, but experience has shown
Fig. 9: CDF of the number of ADNS listed in NS records
in the parent zone are stale. Note that there may be cases
in which a domain is no longer used by its owners but a
nameserver still provides a response. Of the d1N S we found
in our active measurements, 60.1% had no response from an
authoritative nameserver. This percentage is much higher for
d1N S under particular dgov, as shown in Figure 8.
Diversity of Nameservers. Not just the number of physical
hosts, but also the placement of authoritative nameservers
plays a key role in maintaining a robust ADNS deployment.
Using the active measurements, we evaluated the domains
with multiple nameservers. For each domain, we identiﬁed
the set of IPv4 addresses (IPns) to which its nameservers
resolve. Using Maxmind’s GeoIP2 ASN (Autonomous System
Number) database [33], we determined the number of /24
preﬁxes (24ns) and ASNs (ASNns) to which the IPs in
IPns belong. Table I shows these statistics. Curiously, we
observed some cases of a single IP address being used, even
when the domain has multiple nameservers listed. More than
half of these cases were linked to domains in a single dgov.
Many of these domains are sharing nameserver pairs that
resolve to the same IP address. Regarding IP diversity, in most
cases the nameservers for a given domain cover multiple /24
preﬁxes, although less than a third cover multiple autonomous
systems. While even nameservers in multiple preﬁxes may still
share a single-point-failure (e.g., a border router), our results
suggest that overall, most zones have a diverse placement of
authoritative nameservers.
Whether we use the /24 preﬁx or autonomous system to
estimate replication, the percentage of domains with sufﬁ-
ciently distributed authoritative nameservers is relatively low
compared to the results in [21]. In that work, the author found
