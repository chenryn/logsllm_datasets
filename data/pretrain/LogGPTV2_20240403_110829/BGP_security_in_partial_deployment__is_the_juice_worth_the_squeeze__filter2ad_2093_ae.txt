### Methodology and Graph Construction

To construct the initial graph, we adopted a two-step approach: (1) selecting ASes through a convenient method, and (2) recursively removing ASes that had no providers with a low degree and were not Tier 1 ISPs. The resulting graph comprised 39,056 ASes, 73,442 customer-provider links, and 62,129 peer-to-peer links.

Empirical AS graphs often lack many peer-to-peer links in Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) [3, 5, 45]. To address this, we constructed a second graph by augmenting the UCLA graph with over 550,000 additional peer-to-peer edges. These edges connected ASes listed as members of the same IXP (as of September 24, 2012) from voluntary online sources such as IXP websites, EuroIX, Peering DB, and Packet Clearing House. Our list included 332 IXPs and 10,835 mappings of member ASes to IXPs. After adding these edges, the graph was augmented with 552,933 extra peering links.

Since not all ASes at an IXP peer with each other [3], our augmented graph serves as an upper bound on the number of missing links in the AS graph. Repeating our simulations on this second graph, we found that all the aggregate trends discussed in subsequent sections still hold, indicating robustness to missing IXP edges. (Results are detailed in Appendix J.)

### S*BGP Routing

ASes running BGP independently compute routes to each destination AS \( d \in V \). For every destination AS \( d \), each source AS \( s \in V \setminus \{d\} \) uses its local BGP decision process to select the "best" route to \( d \) from the routes learned from neighboring ASes. The selected route is then announced to a subset of neighbors according to the local export policy.

- **Route Learning and Announcement**: An AS \( s \) learns a route if it is announced by a neighbor. \( s \) has or uses a route \( R \) if it selects \( R \) from its set of available routes. A route is classified as a customer, peer, or provider route based on the relationship with the neighboring AS (see Figure 1 for an example).

### Insecure Routing Policy Model

When choosing between multiple routes to a destination \( d \), each insecure AS follows these steps (in order):

1. **Local Preference (LP)**: 
   - Prefer customer routes over peer routes.
   - Prefer peer routes over provider routes.
2. **Shortest AS Path (SP)**: 
   - Prefer shorter routes over longer routes.
3. **Tiebreak (TB)**: 
   - Use intradomain criteria (e.g., geographic location, device ID) to break ties among remaining routes.

After selecting a single route, the AS announces it to a subset of its neighbors based on the following export policy:

- **Export Policy (Ex)**: 
  - If the route is via a customer, it is exported to all neighbors.
  - Otherwise, it is exported only to customers.

The relative ranking of LP, SP, and TB is standard in most router implementations [13]. The LP and Ex steps are based on the classical economic model of BGP routing [16, 17, 25, 26]. LP captures ASes' incentives to send traffic along revenue-generating customer routes, rather than through peers (which do not increase revenue) or providers (which come at a monetary cost). Ex reflects ASes' willingness to transit traffic only when paid by a customer.

### Robustness to LP Model

While this paper reports results for the above LP model, we also tested their robustness to other LP models. The results are presented in Appendix K.

### Secure Routing Policy Models

Every secure AS adds the following step to its routing policy:

- **Secure Paths (SecP)**: 
  - Prefer a secure route over an insecure route.

We consider three models for incorporating the SecP step:

1. **Security 1st**:
   - SecP is placed before the LP step, prioritizing security above all else.
2. **Security 2nd**:
   - SecP comes between the LP and SP steps, placing economic considerations above security.
3. **Security 3rd**:
   - SecP comes between SP and TB steps, prioritizing security below business considerations and AS-path length. This model is also used in [19].

### Security 1st Model Unpopularity

While the Security 1st model is the most idealistic from a security perspective, it is likely the least realistic. During incremental deployment, network operators are expected to cautiously incorporate S*BGP into routing policies, placing security 2nd or 3rd to avoid disruptions due to changes in traffic engineering and revenue loss when expensive secure routes are chosen over revenue-generating customer routes. The Security 1st model might be used only in highly security-conscious environments.
