## ‚Ñπ Computer information
  * PowerToys version: 22.0
  * PowerToy Utility: FancyZones
  * Running PowerToys as Admin: yes
  * Windows build number: version 1909 (OS build 18363.1082)
## üìù Provide detailed reproduction steps (if any)
  1. 2 monitors: 1 is 144hz the other is 60hz
  2. PC turns on, PT opens on startup as admin
  3. using win+` or opening the settings and then editor to select the zone set up I want to use
  4. hitting apply on a custom or template zone
  5. drag a window while holding shift or right click to place a window into a desired zone  
_note_ make windows transparent when dragging is on, also wallpaper engine is
running, but that program provides no conflicts for FancyZones for my friend
who uses 1 monitor.
### ‚úîÔ∏è Expected result:
FancyZones works as intended and windows snap to their zones
### ‚ùå Actual result:
The windows will go transparent when I am dragging them, but they have nothing
to snap to and refuse to snap. First screen shot is the preview of the zone
being selected. Second screen shot is a clip from a quick recording of what
happens when I have zones enabled(hence transparency) and try to drag it to
the desired zone. Spotify was used as an example here.
