## ‚Ñπ Computer information

  * Running PowerToys as Admin: Yes
  * Windows build number: 19041.572
## üìù Provide detailed reproduction steps (if any)
  1. Install and run PowerToys
  2. Open Window off-screen (sort of a bug in itself, but a common Windows issue)
  3. Press Alt+Space to open the Window menu to allow it to be moved back on-screen
### ‚úîÔ∏è Expected result
The window menu appears (Restore, move, size, etc)
### ‚ùå Actual result
A popup appears, with no indication that it is related to PowerToys, that just
says "Start typing...".
One of the following should happen
  * It needs to be made clear that the window that appears is related to PowerToys Run (or at least PowerToys). It was a bit of luck that led me to realise it was PowerToys that had taken the shortcut
  * Change the shortcut to one that is not used in Windows by default
  * Do not turn it on by default, or make it an option during install (again, not enabled by default)
