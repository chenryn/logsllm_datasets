User: I've created a program using Python on Windows. How do you turn it into Linux executable? To be specific Linux Ubuntu 9.10.
Assistant: I have no experience deploying applications on Linux - but can't you add dependencies when you package the software for apt-get?  I install packages that bring in other libraries all the time.  Seems like you could do this for wx.
