ABSTRACT
The ubiquity of sensor-rich mobile devices is pushing forward the
paradigm of mobile crowdsensing, which facilitates convenient and
cost-effective collection of large amounts of sensory data (e.g., traf-
fic monitoring, environment monitoring, and mobile personalized
recommendation services [1, 2]). In practice, however, the sensory
data collected from different mobile devices are not always reliable,
due to various factors like heterogeneous sensor quality, noise, etc.
Hence, a realistic problem faced by mobile crowdsensing is how
to extract truthful information from the unreliable sensory data,
which is also known as truth discovery [3]. Meanwhile, data privacy
has long been an acute concern in mobile crowdsensing systems, as
sensory data may reveal sensitive information like daily routines,
location, personal health, social relations, and more [1]. In light of
these observations, there has been an increasing interest to explore
and develop sound privacy-preserving truth discovery techniques
for mobile crowdsensing in recent years [4, 5].
In this keynote, I will present our research on privacy-preserving
truth discovery in mobile crowdsensing. Compared with prior work,
our goal is to promise privacy preservation, cost efficiency, and
mobile-friendly deployment at the same time for truth discovery
in mobile crowdsensing. I will first discuss the research challenges,
which mainly lie in the complicated functionality requirements of
truth discovery and practical deployment. I will then introduce our
solutions on privacy-preserving truth discovery in mobile crowd-
sensing [6–8], which build on advanced cryptographic techniques
(like garbled circuits and homomorphic encryption) and present in-
depth customization aimed for practical performance. Finally, I will
discuss some future directions for researchers and practitioners to
further investigate innovative solutions toward privacy-preserving
truth discovery in mobile crowdsensing.
