Abstract. Today’s Internet is dominated by HTTP services and Con-
tent Delivery Networks (CDNs). Popular web services like Facebook and
YouTube are hosted by highly distributed CDNs like Akamai and Google.
Understanding this new complex Internet scenario is paramount for net-
work operators, to control the traﬃc on their networks and to improve
the quality experienced by their customers, specially when something
goes wrong. This paper studies the most popular HTTP services and
their underlying hosting networks, through the analysis of a full week of
HTTP traﬃc traces collected at an operational mobile network.
Keywords: HTTP Traﬃc, Content Delivery Networks, Mobile Net-
works.

Introduction
Today’s Internet is shaped by the success of large services running on top of
HTTP. HTTP is currently the dominating content delivery protocol, accounting
for more than 75% of the residential customers traﬃc [1]. HTTP-based services
such as YouTube and Facebook are forcing the Internet to shift the content as
close as possible to the users. The very last few years have seen an astonishing
development in Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) technology, and nowadays
Internet content is delivered by large CDNs like Akamai or Google.
This paper studies the dynamics of the top Internet services running on HTTP.
Using a full week of HTTP traﬃc traces collected at the mobile broadband net-
work of a major European ISP, we study the associations between services and
the hosting organizations providing the content. The dataset consists of more
than half a billion HTTP ﬂows. For each ﬂow, the dataset contains the con-
tacted URL, the server IP address, the total bytes exchanged with this server
IP, the duration of the ﬂow, and a timestamp. The dataset includes the organiza-
tion/AS owning the server IP hosting the content, extracted from the MaxMind
databases1. The services running on top of the HTTP ﬂows are classiﬁed us-
ing HTTPTag [6]. HTTPTag is an on-line HTTP classiﬁcation system based on
pattern matching, applied to the requested URL.

by the European Commission under the grant 318627.

The study and characterization of the Internet traﬃc hosted and delivered
by the top content providers and CDNs has gained important momentum in
the last few years [2–4]. In the speciﬁc case of HTTP traﬃc, classiﬁcation and
analysis has been the focus of many recent studies [1, 5–7].
2 HTTP Services, CDNs, and Content Providers
Figs. 1(a) and 1(b) depict the distribution of HTTP traﬃc volume and number
of users covered by HTTPTag on a normal day. HTTPTag classiﬁes more than
70% of the total HTTP traﬃc volume caused by almost 90% of the web users in
the studied network. The top-10-volume services account for almost 60% of the
overall HTTP traﬃc, and the 10 most popular services are accessed by about
80% of the users. Fig. 1(c) shows the HTTP volume labeled by HTTPTag on
the studied dataset. The list of top-volume services include YouTube, Facebook,
Google Search, Apple Store and iTunes, two Adult Video Streaming services
(AVS 1 and AVS 2), and Windows Update.
These services are hosted by multiple ASes. Fig. 1(d) depicts the fraction of
HTTP traﬃc volume hosted by the top ASes and CDNs. The local ISP ASes
host more than 30% of the total traﬃc, evidencing the large usage of content
caching. Google hosts the lion share of YouTube, whereas Akamai hosts contents
such as Facebook static ﬁles, Apple Store/iTunes, and Windows updates among
others. Figs. 1(e) and 1(f) depict the share and daily number of unique server
IPs hosting the top services. Google and Akamai are the most distributed orgs.
in terms of server IPs. The change in the number of IPs being used by Google
Search, Facebook, and YouTube is impressive, going from about 250 IPs per
service at 5 am to up to 1200 in the case of Google Search.

3 Content Location and Performance
We study now the characteristics of the ﬂows provisioned by each organization,
focusing only on the largest ﬂows, bigger than 1 MB. Figs. 2(a) and 2(b) depict
the distribution of the average ﬂow size and duration for some of the top or-
ganizations hosting content. Flows provided by LeaseWeb and Akamai are the
biggest in terms of volume and duration, and specially LeaseWeb delivers very
big and long ﬂows. In terms of throughput, Fig. 2(c) depicts the average down-
load throughput distribution; ﬂows cached at the local ISP are served the fastest,
with an average download throughput of about 2.7 Mbps, followed by Akamai,
Amazon, and Microsoft.
To conclude, we analyze the location of the servers hosting the content. We
consider the min Round Trip Time (RTT) to the hosting servers as a measure
of the servers distance from the vantage point. Figs. 2(d) and 2(e) depict the
min RTT values per service and per hosting organization. A large fraction of
the Facebook, Apple, and Windows Update ﬂows come from servers probably
located in the same city of the vantage point, as min RTT values are below 5ms.
These three services are largely provided by Akamai. The AVS 2 service seems
to be mainly served from two locations in Europe (min RTT ≈ 30ms), perfectly
matching the results for Limelight (the hosting CDN). Fig. 2(f) depicts the
hourly evolution of the min RTT for YouTube ﬂows during 4 consecutive days.
Each column depicts the CDF of the min RTT. Most of the ﬂows are delivered
from the two Google locations depicted in Fig. 2(b) at 61ms and 63ms. Markedly
min RTT shifts occur every day at exactly the same time slots, suggesting the
usage of time/load-based server selection policies by Google.
