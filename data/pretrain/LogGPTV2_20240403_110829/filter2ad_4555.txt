# Title: Understanding HTTP Traffic and CDN Behavior from the Perspective of a Mobile ISP

## Authors: Pedro Casas, Pierdomenico Fiadino, and Arian Bär

### Abstract
The modern Internet is dominated by HTTP services and Content Delivery Networks (CDNs). Popular web services such as Facebook and YouTube are hosted by highly distributed CDNs like Akamai and Google. For network operators, understanding this complex Internet scenario is crucial for managing traffic and improving the quality of experience for their customers, especially during disruptions. This paper examines the most popular HTTP services and their underlying hosting networks through the analysis of a full week of HTTP traffic traces collected from an operational mobile network.

## 1. Introduction
The contemporary Internet is shaped by the success of large services running on top of HTTP. Currently, HTTP is the dominant content delivery protocol, accounting for over 75% of residential customer traffic [1]. Services like YouTube and Facebook are driving the Internet to shift content as close as possible to users. In recent years, there has been significant development in CDN technology, with major CDNs like Akamai and Google delivering a substantial portion of Internet content.

This paper investigates the dynamics of the top HTTP-based Internet services. Using a full week of HTTP traffic traces collected from the mobile broadband network of a major European ISP, we analyze the associations between services and the hosting organizations providing the content. The dataset comprises more than half a billion HTTP flows, each containing the contacted URL, server IP address, total bytes exchanged, flow duration, and timestamp. The dataset also includes the organization/AS owning the server IP, extracted from MaxMind databases [2]. The services running on top of the HTTP flows are classified using HTTPTag [3], an online HTTP classification system based on pattern matching applied to the requested URL.

## 2. HTTP Services, CDNs, and Content Providers
Figures 1(a) and 1(b) show the distribution of HTTP traffic volume and the number of users covered by HTTPTag on a typical day. HTTPTag classifies over 70% of the total HTTP traffic volume, which is caused by nearly 90% of the web users in the studied network. The top-10-volume services account for almost 60% of the overall HTTP traffic, and the 10 most popular services are accessed by about 80% of the users. Figure 1(c) illustrates the HTTP volume labeled by HTTPTag in the dataset. The list of top-volume services includes YouTube, Facebook, Google Search, Apple Store and iTunes, two Adult Video Streaming services (AVS 1 and AVS 2), and Windows Update.

These services are hosted by multiple ASes. Figure 1(d) shows the fraction of HTTP traffic volume hosted by the top ASes and CDNs. Local ISP ASes host more than 30% of the total traffic, indicating the extensive use of content caching. Google hosts the majority of YouTube, while Akamai hosts content such as Facebook static files, Apple Store/iTunes, and Windows updates. Figures 1(e) and 1(f) depict the share and daily number of unique server IPs hosting the top services. Google and Akamai are the most distributed organizations in terms of server IPs. The change in the number of IPs used by Google Search, Facebook, and YouTube is significant, ranging from about 250 IPs per service at 5 am to up to 1200 in the case of Google Search.

## 3. Content Location and Performance
We now examine the characteristics of the flows provided by each organization, focusing on the largest flows, those exceeding 1 MB. Figures 2(a) and 2(b) show the distribution of the average flow size and duration for some of the top organizations hosting content. Flows provided by LeaseWeb and Akamai are the largest in terms of volume and duration, with LeaseWeb delivering very large and long flows. In terms of throughput, Figure 2(c) shows the average download throughput distribution; flows cached at the local ISP are served the fastest, with an average download throughput of about 2.7 Mbps, followed by Akamai, Amazon, and Microsoft.

To conclude, we analyze the location of the servers hosting the content. We use the minimum Round Trip Time (RTT) to the hosting servers as a measure of the servers' distance from the vantage point. Figures 2(d) and 2(e) show the minimum RTT values per service and per hosting organization. A large fraction of Facebook, Apple, and Windows Update flows come from servers likely located in the same city as the vantage point, as minimum RTT values are below 5ms. These three services are largely provided by Akamai. The AVS 2 service appears to be mainly served from two locations in Europe (minimum RTT ≈ 30ms), which aligns with the results for Limelight (the hosting CDN). Figure 2(f) depicts the hourly evolution of the minimum RTT for YouTube flows over four consecutive days. Each column represents the CDF of the minimum RTT. Most flows are delivered from the two Google locations shown in Figure 2(b) at 61ms and 63ms. Notable shifts in minimum RTT occur at the same time slots every day, suggesting the use of time/load-based server selection policies by Google.
