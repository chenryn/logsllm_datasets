## üìù Provide a description of the new feature
_What is the expected behavior of the proposed feature? What is the scenario
this would be used?_

I hope there's some configurable preference for setting priorities of results
in PT run.  
For example, I can set the priority of "launch an application" to high, so
when I type, say "VSCode", in PT run while there's running instances of
VSCode, the result of launching a new window of VSCode will be the first one,
rather than switching to the exist VSCode window. Or conversely, set the
priority of "switch to a window" to high to make switching to an exist VSCode
window always shows at the first place, so I can use PT run as a perfect
windows switcher as an instead of alt+tab.
If you'd like to see this feature implemented, add a üëç reaction to this post.
