To effectively address the challenges of process monitoring and log collection within Docker containers, you can utilize container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes or Docker Swarm. These tools come equipped with built-in features for both monitoring and log management. They allow for the deployment of monitoring and logging agents directly inside the containers to capture and transmit logs to an external log aggregation system.

Moreover, integrating third-party solutions such as Prometheus for monitoring, Grafana for visualization, and Rizhiyi (or other preferred logging services) can further enhance your capabilities in this area. These tools not only provide advanced functionalities but also offer visual dashboards and reports that enable developers to gain deeper insights into the performance and operational status of their containerized applications, thereby facilitating more effective analysis and optimization.
