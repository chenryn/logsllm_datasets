User: How to solve the problem of process monitoring and log collection inside the Docker container?
Assistant: Process monitoring and log collection can be achieved by using container orchestration tools such as Kubernetes or Docker Swarm. These tools provide built-in monitoring and log collection functions, and can run monitoring agents and log collection agents in the container to grab the logs inside the container and send them to an external log aggregation system. In addition, third-party monitoring and log collection tools such as Prometheus, Grafana, and Rizhiyi can also be used to achieve monitoring and log collection. These tools provide more advanced functions and visual reports to help developers better analyze and optimize the performance and operation of container applications.
