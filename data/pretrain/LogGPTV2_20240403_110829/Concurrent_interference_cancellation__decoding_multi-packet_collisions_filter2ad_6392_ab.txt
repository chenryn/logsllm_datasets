CIC chooses an optimum set of interference cancelling sub-symbols
that provides both time and frequency resolution.
3 LORA DECODING BACKGROUND
In this section we provide the necessary background on LoRa PHY
layer required in the rest of the paper.
Chirp Modulation in LoRa. In LoRa, every data symbol 𝐶𝜙 is
derived by shifting the fundamental symbol 𝐶0 by a frequency 𝑓𝜙.
𝐶0 is a chirp with its instantaneous frequency increasing linearly
with time 𝑡 from − 𝐵
2 over a symbol duration 𝑇𝑠, where 𝐵 is

In Eqn 1, 𝜙 ∈ {0, 1, · · · , 2𝑆𝐹 − 1} and 𝑇𝑠 = 2𝑆𝐹
𝐵 . The spreading
factor, 𝑆𝐹 ∈ {7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12}, fixed for each LoRa packet, dictates
the transmission data rate. Using a larger 𝑆𝐹 extends transmission
range at the cost of using a lower data rate.
Fig 4: Demodulation in LoRa
Demodulation Using De-chirping in Standard LoRa. To de-
modulate a symbol, the LoRa demodulator must estimate 𝑓𝜙. A
LoRa receiver first de-chirps a symbol by multiplying it with down-
chirp 𝐶∗
0(𝑡), the complex conjugate of 𝐶0, over a window aligned
with the symbol’s boundaries (Eqn 3). De-chirping converts the
symbol into a sinusoid of constant frequency 𝑓𝜙. 𝑓𝜙 is recovered by
locating the peak in an FFT of the de-chirped symbol (Figure 1).

In Eqn 4, Φ(𝐶𝜙(𝑡)) represents de-chirping and a 2𝑆𝐹 point FFT over
a symbol 𝐶𝜙(𝑡).
Carrier Frequency Offset (CFO). Carrier Frequency Offset (CFO),
𝛿 𝑓 , is the small difference in generated carrier frequencies between
the transmitter and the receiver due to manufacturing imperfec-
tions. CFO manifests itself as a constant shift in the estimated
symbol frequency so that the peak of a symbol 𝐶𝜙 would be located
as 𝑓𝜙 + 𝛿 𝑓 . Consequently, receivers must estimate and subtract 𝛿 𝑓
Packet Detection using the LoRa Preamble. Before the receiver
can begin demodulating, it must first reliably detect the onset of a
new transmission, determine the exact positions of the boundaries
of the symbols within the packet in order to perform de-chirping
and FFT and, estimate 𝑓𝜙. A preamble preceding the data symbols,
facilitates all these functions(Fig. 5). The LoRa preamble comprises
a sequence of 8 consecutive 𝐶0 symbols, followed by two SYNC
symbols 𝐶𝑥, 𝐶𝑦 (𝑥 ≠ 0, 𝑦 = 𝑥 + 8) and 2.25 down-chirps 𝐶∗
0. To
detect a new transmission, the receiver continuously de-chirps and
performs an FFT until it finds 8 consecutive peaks with the same
frequency. The SYNC words and down-chirps then help locate the
packet’s symbol boundary positions, 𝛿 𝑓 estimation and to confirm
onset of a new packet.
4 LORA DECODING UNDER COLLISIONS
In this section we extend the discussion in Section 3 to a multi-
packet collision scenario.
LoRa Demodulation during a collision. During a packet colli-
sion (Fig. 8), the received signal is a superposition of multiple LoRa
receptions, each starting at a different time, with a different symbol

the demodulation of a LoRa symbol 𝐶1 from transmitter 1 during an
𝑁 packet collision. Since symbol boundaries of colliding transmis-
sions are not aligned, 𝐶1 overlaps partially with two consecutive
symbols from each interfering transmissions – 𝐶𝑖

cies 𝑓 𝑖
𝑛𝑒𝑥𝑡 respectively. 𝜏𝑖 depicts the time difference of
symbol boundaries between 1𝑠𝑡 and 𝑖𝑡ℎ transmission. We assume
that the receiver has accurately determined the symbol boundaries
as well as the CFO for transmitter 1 using preamble detection (as
described in Section 5.8) 𝛿𝑖 represents the difference of the 𝑖𝑡ℎ trans-
mitter’s CFO from that of transmitter 1. The received signal symbol
𝑟(𝑡) (with 𝑡 = 0 at the start of 𝐶1), during the collision is given by,

to the symbol being decoded. This occurs because, the received
powers of the interfering transmissions can be stronger than the
one being decoded.
5 CIC
As described in Section 4, in the event of an 𝑁 packet collision,
the received signal of the symbol being decoded, 𝑟(𝑡) (Eqn 5), com-
prises a superposition of 2(𝑁 − 1) interfering symbols in addition
to the symbol of interest (𝐶1). Consequently, the de-chirped signal
comprises 2𝑁 − 1 frequencies instead of one. CIC exploits tem-
poral variations in spectral content of the symbol as interfering
transmissions transition through their respective symbols. The key
observation that drives the design of CIC is that none of the interfering
symbols span the entire symbol duration while 𝐶1 does.
CIC selects a specific set of sub-symbols (parts of the symbol
being decoded) such that none of the interfering symbols is common
across all these sub-symbols. Such a set of sub-symbols is deemed
the Interference Cancelling Sub-Symbol Set (ICSS). This means
that the only common frequency across all sub-symbols in an ICSS
will be 𝐶1, as it is present in all sub-symbols of 𝑟(𝑡). By estimating
spectra for all sub-symbols in the ICSS and extracting the common
frequency, CIC removes all interfering symbols while retaining the
frequency 𝑓 1 corresponding to 𝐶1.
Sub-Symbols. A sub-symbol 𝑟𝑖→𝑗 (𝑡) is a part of the received sym-
bol 𝑟(𝑡) that start at 𝑡 = 𝜏𝑖 and ends at 𝑡 = 𝜏 𝑗. Recall that 𝑡 = 𝜏𝑖 is
the symbol boundary of the 𝑖𝑡ℎ transmission when it transitions
from 𝐶𝑖
𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑣 to 𝐶𝑖

As an example, Figure 7 depicts the set of sub-symbols 𝑟𝑖→𝑖+1(𝑡).
The key property common to these sub-symbols is that each of
the sub-symbols comprises exactly 𝑁 − 1 interfering symbols –

transitioned to transmitting the symbol 𝐶𝑘
𝑛𝑒𝑥𝑡, thus for all these
𝑛𝑒𝑥𝑡 are absent and 𝑓 𝑘
transmissions, all 𝑓 𝑘
𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑣 are present. Thus,
the spectrum of their de-chirped versions Φ(𝑟𝑖→𝑖+1(𝑡)) (Eqn 4),
comprises a set of exactly the 𝑁 frequencies 𝐹(𝑟𝑖→𝑖+1) = {𝑓 1} ∪
𝑛𝑒𝑥𝑡} ∪ {𝑓 𝑖+1

of the symbol to be decoded will be present in all sub-symbols since it
is present throughout 𝑟(𝑡).
Interference Cancelling Sub-Symbol Set (ICSS). Consider the
set of sub-symbols {𝑟1→2(𝑡), 𝑟𝑁→𝑁+1(𝑡)}. 𝐹 (𝑟1→2(𝑡)) comprises
of the frequencies {𝑓 1} ∪ {𝑓 1
𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑣} as none of the symbols
have transitioned to their next symbol. 𝐹 (𝑟𝑁→𝑁+1(𝑡)) comprises of
the frequencies {𝑓 1} ∪ {𝑓 1
𝑛𝑒𝑥𝑡} as all of the symbols have
transitioned to their next symbol. Thus, no interfering symbol fre-
quencies are common across this set of frequencies. Consequently,
{𝑟1→2(𝑡), 𝑟𝑁→𝑁+1(𝑡)} is an example of ICSS.
A Strawman-CIC. To provide an intuition into how CIC works, we
consider a Strawman-CIC that uses the ICSS {𝑟1→2(𝑡), 𝑟𝑁→𝑁+1(𝑡)}.
The only constituent frequency common to these two sections
is 𝑓 1. Thus, 𝑓 1 can be extracted by estimating all the frequen-
cies in 𝐹(𝑟1→2(𝑡)) and 𝐹(𝑟𝑁→𝑁+1(𝑡)) and finding 𝐹(𝑟1→2(𝑡)) ∩
𝐹(𝑟𝑁→𝑁+1(𝑡)) ( Figure 9). As we discuss later in this section, Strawman-
