Various relay and other NFC attacks have been presented in
hacking conferences, such as [21,24,29,31]. In particular, [29]
presents a relay attack implementation that uses two Software
Deﬁned Radio (SDR) boards, which offer a faster and more
controlled relay channel than the ones implemented using
mobile phones over WiFi, according to the authors. However,
the transmission speed of WiFi-based relay channels has not
been an issue in any of our tests using our Android app.
Galloway and Yunusov [21] were the pioneers in bypassing
PIN veriﬁcation for modern Visa contactless cards. Their man-
in-the-middle attack, implemented using wired Raspberry Pi
boards, modiﬁes both the Terminal Transaction Qualiﬁers
(TTQ) before delivering it to the card and the Card Trans-
action Qualiﬁers (CTQ) before transmitting it back to the
terminal. The authors did not however weaponize their attack
in a way that it could be inconspicuously used in real stores.
Galloway recently showed [20] that it is possible, still in
2020, to clone a card and use the clone for swiped transactions.
The author shows that the cloning can be made effortlessly,
using the MSR605 magnetic card reader/writer, which costs
around 100 USD. This research also shows that the data used
to create the counterfeit magstripe cards can be read from the
EMV interfaces (both NFC and contact chip) with a skimmer
device. The data needed is part of the Track 1 and Track 2
Equivalent Data objects, provided by the card during an EMV
session. Back in 2008, Drimer et al. [12] also demonstrated
cloning from EMV chip data to magstripe; thus this problem
has remained unﬁxed even after 12 years.
As explained throughout this paper, our card brand mixup
attack builds on our previous work [6]. In a nutshell, there
are three main differences between our previous work and
this new work. First, the card brand mixup attack is com-
pletely novel and exposes a serious weakness in EMV that
permits payments with Mastercard cards for fraudulent Visa
transactions. Second, we have extended our previous model
of the issuer and of the terminal-issuer channel to support
the completion of online transactions where the terminal and
issuer do not observe the same card brand. We have used our
extended model to verify our new ﬁxes that prevent the card
brand mixup. Finally, concerning the implementation of our
attack, nearly 1,000 lines of Java code in our software instru-
ment the NFC message modiﬁcations speciﬁc to the attack as

well as the required cryptographic mechanisms such as the
retrieval of PKs from PK certiﬁcates. Our PIN bypass attack
on Visa does not require any of these mechanisms.

6 Conclusions
We have identiﬁed a serious, easily exploitable vulnerabil-
ity in the EMV contactless protocol, namely the Application
Identiﬁers (AIDs) are not authenticated to the payment ter-
minal. The AIDs deﬁne what instance (a.k.a. kernel) of the
protocol must be activated for the transaction. As a result,
an adversary can maliciously replace the legitimate AIDs to
deceive the terminal into activating a ﬂawed kernel.
We have shown how to exploit this vulnerability using a
man-in-the-middle attack that tricks the terminal into trans-
acting with a Mastercard card, while believing it to be a Visa
card. This card brand mixup, in combination with our recently
developed PIN bypass attack [6] on Visa, results in a novel,
critical attack where criminals can bypass the PIN for Master-
card cards. The cards of this brand were previously presumed
protected by PIN. Shockingly, this is even possible for trans-
actions that are authorized online in which the terminal and
the card issuer do not agree on the payment card’s brand.
To carry out our exploit, we developed a proof-of-concept
Android application and successfully tested our attack on a
real-world payment terminal. For example, we bypassed the
PIN in a transaction for 400 CHF with a Maestro debit card.
We have also extended our formal model of EMV by mod-
eling the terminal-issuer channel in a way that allows for
communication even when these agents disagree on the card
brand. We used our extended model to formally verify that
the ready-to-deploy ﬁxes applicable to the Visa kernel that
we proposed in [6] are an effective countermeasure to our
Mastercard-Visa mixup attack. Additionally, we have speci-
ﬁed and veriﬁed two new intra-kernel countermeasures that
can be implemented on the Mastercard kernel without relying
on Visa’s defenses. Furthermore, Mastercard has implemented
an alternative defense mechanism at the network level, which
we have experimentally conﬁrmed as effective against our
attack.
