We have developed an Electron application that opens a new window from the main window, which contains a Flash application. To enable this, we set the `plugins` option to `true` in the `BrowserWindow` configuration, and everything works as expected.

However, we encounter an issue when the Flash application within this new window attempts to launch another window containing a Flash component. The Flash component fails to load because it cannot find the Flash plugin. Interestingly, the child application functions correctly if we launch it directly in a standard web browser or if we launch it directly from Electron with the `plugins` option set to `true`.

To address this, we propose two potential modifications to Electron:

1. **Inheritance of Parent Window Options:** Allow child windows to inherit the options (such as `plugins: true`) from their parent window.
2. **Default Options for Child Windows:** Provide a way to specify default options for child windows, ensuring that they also have the necessary settings (e.g., `plugins: true`).

Alternatively, is there a current method to achieve this functionality that we might have overlooked?

Thank you for your assistance.
