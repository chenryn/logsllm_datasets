We have an Electron app which launches a new window containing a Flash
application from the main window. We set `plugins` to `true` in the
`BrowserWindow` options and away it goes. All good.
However, the Flash app itself then launches another window containing a Flash
component. The Flash component fails because it cannot find the Flash plugin.
This child app works fine if we just launch it directly in a browser OR if we
launch it directly from Electron with `plugins` set to `true`.
Could Electron be modified to either:  
a) allow these child windows to inherit the options of the parent window,
or...  
b) allow option defaults to be specified for these child windows
or have I missed something and there's an easy way to currently do this?
Thanks.
