Hi all,
First of all let me say that i am just now exploring react and typescript. So
as i was reading all about both ecosystems i found out about this great
project, thank you all for making all these great definitions.
I'm starting a project where i also want to use react-router, but immediately
found out while i was coding that the definitions for the react-router were
wrong. I forked this repository to update the react-router.d.ts and as i was
editing i realise that the react-router.d.ts relates to the 0.13 version of
react-router. I want to contribute to this repository by updating react-
router.d.ts definitions as i need them, but i find it wrong to overwrite the
0.13 version with 1.0 definitions. So, what to do? Should i create another
file for the 1.0 version or overwrite the 0.13?
Thank you all!
