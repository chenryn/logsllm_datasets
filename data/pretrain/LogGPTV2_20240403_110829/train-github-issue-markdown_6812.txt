Subject: Contribution to React-Router Definitions in TypeScript

Hello everyone,

I hope this message finds you well. I am currently exploring the use of React and TypeScript, and during my research, I came across your project. I would like to express my gratitude for the excellent work on the definitions available here.

I have started a new project that will utilize `react-router`. While working on it, I noticed that the existing type definitions for `react-router` in this repository are outdated; they correspond to version 0.13, whereas I am using version 1.0. I have already forked the repository with the intention of updating the `react-router.d.ts` file to be compatible with the newer version. However, I am hesitant to overwrite the current definitions, as they may still be useful for those who are using the 0.13 version.

To address this, I propose creating a separate file for the updated 1.0 definitions, ensuring backward compatibility and avoiding any disruptions for users of the older version. I am eager to contribute these updates but seek guidance on the best approach to take.

Thank you for considering my proposal. I look forward to your feedback.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
