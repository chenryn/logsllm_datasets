### Version
2.5.9
### Reproduction link
https://codepen.io/maple-leaf/pen/BmgaqG
### Steps to reproduce
  1. open the codepen demo
  2. open devtool if u are on chrome
  3. click `change data which will raise error` button
  4. now you should see an error like this: `TypeError: Cannot read property 'key' of undefined`.
  5. refresh demo page
  6. click `safe to change data here` button
  7. now you should not see an error like before, and data being updated correctly
### What is expected?
maybe same behavior like both should raise an error, but if raise error, maybe
`duplicate key` error should be showed too **which will help developer easier
to find what data is killing page**.
### What is actually happening?
both data have duplicate keys, but behavior is different
* * *
why error being raise when you click `change data which will raise error`
button?
Because the data will raise error has some special changes. It remove all keys
except duplicate key 'b' compared to initial data and the order is different.
This will make `updateChildren` function in `vdom/patch.js` hit this code
section, which will create a `oldKeyToIdx`. And then when first key 'b' comes,
it will set value of `b` in `oldKeyToIdx` to `undefined`, and then next key
`b` comes, it will compare old node and new node via function sameNode. But
this time, index of old node which key is `b` is undefined now. So a js error
is being raised.
