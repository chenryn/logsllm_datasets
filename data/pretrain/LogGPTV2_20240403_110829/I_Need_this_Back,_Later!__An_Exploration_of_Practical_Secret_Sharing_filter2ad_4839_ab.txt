### Understanding and Protection in Online Management

To avoid mistakes, it is essential to have a thorough understanding of computer processes. For instance, shares should not be stored in folders that are mirrored to cloud storage providers and shared with others. Remote copies of shares must be deleted from potentially risky locations, such as the mailbox on the server of one’s email provider. The diligent protection of an online computer system against unauthorized access requires expertise. Therefore, we rate the ability of condants to protect shares online as limited (bad).

### Costs of Managing Shares

The monetary costs of managing shares online are negligible (good). In contrast, the distribution of tangible items incurs costs for travel or postal services (bad). Similarly, the time investment required for online distribution is minimal, whereas the time investment for offline sharing is relatively large.

### Conclusions

We conclude that the online and offline scenarios address different types of adversaries. Attacks in the offline scenario require significantly more resources, including a diverse skill set, physical presence, and individual targeting. This limits the scalability of attacks. Consequently, adversaries are likely motivated differently in the online and offline scenarios, suggesting that these two scenarios exist independently and merit individual study. A comparative empirical study of the two scenarios is unlikely to be informative for choosing between them. The choice of approach should be informed by the assumption of adversarial risk and the feasibility of the models from a user perspective. In the remainder of this paper, we focus on the offline management scenario and leave further study of online management to future work.

## Form Factor Survey

In this section, we describe the preparatory steps taken to support our choice of form factors for our field study. We selected candidate form factors through a brainstorming session, guided by criteria such as durability and low production costs. We decided to deprioritize the question of how share information would be embedded on tangibles, as it would always be possible to embed an RFID chip in a tangible. The resulting form factors and categories were:
- Sheet of paper
- Key with an attached key tag
- Letter envelope
- Dice
- Board game figurine
- CD, SD card, USB thumb drive, or other portable storage medium

### Materials and Methods

#### 4.1.1 Recruitment

Participants were recruited over two weeks on the campus of our university. Locations were spread across the campus to ensure a diverse sample, including faculties such as humanities, political and social sciences, international studies, law, business, biology, chemistry, pharmacy, physics, mathematics, and computer science. Participants were recruited according to a protocol and interviewed on the spot if they agreed to participate. Only participants in a sitting position and alone were recruited to increase the likelihood of their availability and to avoid group dynamics. A randomized yes/no list was used to limit bias in participant selection.

#### 4.1.2 Interview Procedure

The same scenario was read to all participants, and the same materials were provided. The scenario was:
"Assume that a friend asks you to keep an item in storage for him/her. Which of the following items would you be able to retrieve after one year? Please name the top 3 ones."

After presenting the choices, we asked a follow-up question:
"Do you already know where you would keep that item?"

Participants' age and gender were also recorded, along with any additional comments.

#### 4.1.3 Participants

We recruited 24 participants, 16 of whom were female. The age range was from 19 to 28 years, with an average age of 24.

### Results

Two participants (P17, P21) had no preference for any of the objects. Two more participants (P6, P8) only gave two preferences. Twenty-one of the 22 participants who had preferences preferred the key with tag, 14 preferred portable storage media, and 13 preferred paper sheets. The key with tag was the first choice in 14 out of 22 cases, paper in 2 cases, and media in 5 cases. Figurines were mentioned 3 times and once as a first choice. Dice were the least preferred, with only two mentions in third position. Table 5 in the appendix summarizes the distribution of answers.

Most participants mentioned a specific place where they would keep the item even before being asked. Six participants said they would keep the item in a drawer, one participant with a preference for storage media mentioned a specific drawer for technical devices, three mentioned a box, and each of keyboard, pinboard, shelf, and wardrobe were mentioned once. The remaining 11 participants had no preference or no specific place in mind. Eight of the 14 participants who mentioned the key with tag as their first choice mentioned a specific place where they might keep the item.

### Discussion

Our survey was not designed to determine the "best" form factor but rather to validate whether our brainstorming led us in the right direction. Based on the results, we chose to move forward with the key tag (without the key) and paper sheets. The key with tag was a clear preference both overall and as a first choice. We wanted to measure how well users retrieve a digital key encoded on the key tag, and we were curious if condants would store the key tag where they keep physical keys, suggesting an association between digital and physical keys.

Paper sheets and portable storage media were close in overall preference, but media were given a higher rank on average (1.9 versus 2.3). However, from the perspective of condants, paper sheets are more convenient and cost-effective. Additionally, paper sheets fit better into our offline scenario.

The majority of participants volunteered a place where they would keep the item, reassuring us that pairing by association is worth studying in the context of secret sharing.

### Limitations

#### 4.4.1 Internal Validity

We ensured that all options were presented neutrally and avoided group dynamics by interviewing individuals alone. Our scenario was highly specific to our research objective, and we expect good internal validity.

#### 4.4.2 External Validity

Our survey is not suitable for generalization due to the small number of participants and the specific demographic (students). Generalizing to a larger population was not our goal. Despite its lack of external validity, the survey served its purpose of helping us decide which form factors to study further.

## Field Study

Secret sharing involves the processes of key generation, share generation, share distribution, share retrieval, and key recovery. Our field study focused on share distribution and retrieval, simulating the other processes on behalf of participants. Before reporting the details of our field study, we specify our terminology and the roles of individuals involved.

- **Experimenter:** The individual or group conducting the empirical study.
- **Participant:** An individual who has consented to participate, receives key shares, distributes them to condants, and later retrieves them.
- **Condant:** An individual who agrees to keep a key share on behalf of the participant and return it upon request.

### Methods

#### 5.1.1 Solicitation of Participation

We posted 50 posters on pinboards across the university campus, soliciting participation and providing contact information. Invitations were also sent to mailing lists, offering a compensation of €10 and a chance to win a €100 Amazon Gift Card.

#### 5.1.2 Group Assignment

Participants were assigned to form factor groups T or P in an alternating fashion. If a participant did not follow through, another individual was assigned on a first-come, first-serve basis.

#### 5.1.3 Briefing

Participants were individually briefed in the same room by the same experimenter. They received a description of the study's purpose and procedures, and were asked to summarize the contents verbally. The experimenter offered to answer questions and demonstrated the registration process using a dummy share. Participants were asked to give informed consent and were informed they could end their participation at any time without giving a reason.

For practical reasons, we chose k = 3 and n = 5, keeping the burden on participants reasonable while allowing for some variance in return rates.

#### 5.1.4 Registration of Shares

A concern was whether participants would actually distribute the shares or keep them. To address this, we asked participants to register their shares at a provided website.
