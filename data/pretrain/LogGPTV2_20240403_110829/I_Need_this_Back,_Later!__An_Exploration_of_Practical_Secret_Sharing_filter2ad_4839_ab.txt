understanding of the functions of computer processes in order to
avoid mistakes. For example, shares must not be stored in a folder
that is mirrored to a cloud storage provider and shared with others.
Remote copies of shares must be deleted from storage locations that
pose a risk, for example, the mailbox on the server of one’s mail
provider. Diligent protection of an online computer system against
illicit access passes into the realm of expert computer users. Hence,
we rate condants’ ability to protect shares online as limited (bad).
Costs of managing shares. We posit without discussion that the
monetary costs of managing shares online is negligible (good). On
the other hand, the distribution of tangibles incurs costs for travel
or postal service (bad). Likewise, the investment of time needed for
online distribution is negligible whereas the time investment for
oine sharing is relatively large.
Conclusions. We conclude that the online and oine scenarios
address dierent types of adversaries. Attacks in the oine scenario
require signicantly more resources because a more diverse skill
set is necessary, physical distance must be bridged and attacks must
be targeted individually. This also limits the scalability of attacks in
signicant ways. Therefore, we believe it safe to assume that adver-
saries are motivated dierently in the online and oine scenarios.
This suggests that the two scenarios exist independently of each
other and merit individual study. A comparative empirical study
of the two scenarios is therefore unlikely informative with respect
to choosing between online and oine management. The choice
of approach is rather informed by the assumption of adversarial
risk and by the question how feasible the models are individually
from a user perspective. In the remainder of the paper, we focus on
the oine management scenario and leave further study of online
management to future work.
4 FORM FACTOR SURVEY
In this section, we describe preparatory steps we made to support
our choice of form factors for our eld study. We selected candidate
form factors in the course of a brainstorming. Guiding criteria for
our brainstorming were properties that we expected form factors to
have, for example, durability and relatively low costs of production.
We decided to depriorize the question of how share information
would be ingrained on tangibles. In a worst-case scenario it would

always be possible to embed an RFID chip in a tangible. The outcome
were six form factors and form factor categories, namely: a sheet
of paper, a key with an attached key tag, a letter envelope, a dice, a
board game gurine and a CD, SD card, USB thumbdrive or other
portable storage medium.
Subsequently we conducted a survey in order to arrive at two
choices of form factors suitable for use in a subsequent eld experi-
ment in which we intended to measure and compare their recovery
rates. We hypothesized that keys with tags might work well because
it is not uncommon to give apartment keys to neighbors when trav-
eling so that they can water plants or feed pets meanwhile. Dice,
on the other hand, seemed to be a somewhat obscure choice that
we included to provide an opportunity for greater variance in the
responses of survey participants.
4.1 Materials and Methods
4.1.1 Recruitment. We recruited survey participants on the cam-
pus of our university over the course of two weeks. The locations
were spread across campus in order to increase the diversity of
faculties represented in our sample. Nearby faculties included the
humanities, political and social sciences, international studies, law,
business, biology, chemistry, pharmacy, physics, mathematics and
computer science.
Participants were recruited according to a protocol and inter-
viewed on the spot if they agreed to participate. We recruited only
participants in sitting position who sat alone. This was meant to
increase the chance that an individual actually had spare time to
participate. We avoided groups because of potential group dynam-
ics and interference during the interview. Once the recruiter spotted
a likely participant he consulted a randomized yes/no list. The can-
didate was approached if and only if the next unused entry was a
“yes.” The intention was to limit conscious and subconscious bias
in the selection of participants.
4.1.2
Interview Procedure. We read the same scenario to all
participants and provided the same materials. The scenario was as
follows:
Assume that a friend asks you to keep an item in storage
for him/her. Which of the following items would you be
able to retrieve after one year? Please name the top 3
ones.
Immediately after the introduction of the scenario we presented the
choices in Appendix A to the participants. Following a participant’s
answer we asked a follow-up question:
Do you already know where you would keep that item?
We asked participants for their age and gender as well. All answers
to the questions were recorded on paper. Additionally, we recorded
any comments participants had, on paper as well.
4.1.3 Participants. We recruited 24 participants of which 16
were female. The age of our participants ranged from 19 to 28 years
with an average of 24 years.
4.2 Results
Two participants (P17, P21) answered that they had no preference
for any of the objects. Two more participants (P6, P8) only gave two
481
preferences. Twenty-one of the 22 participants who had preferences
preferred the key with tag, 14 preferred portable storage media and
13 preferred paper sheets. Key with tag was the rst choice in 14
of 22 cases, paper in 2 cases and media in 5 cases. Figurines were
mentioned 3 times and once as a rst choice. Dice were the least
preferred choice with two mentions in third position. Table 5 in
the appendix summarizes the distribution of answers to our rst
question.
Most participants mentioned a specic place where they would
keep the item even before we asked this question. Six participants
said they would keep the item in a drawer. One participant with
a preference for storage media mentioned that he has a specic
drawer for technical devices. Three participants mentioned a box.
Each of keyboard, pinboard, shelf and wardrobe were mentioned
once. The remaining 11 participants responded that they had no
preference or no specic place in mind. Eight of the 14 participants
who mentioned key with tag as their rst choice mentioned a
specic place where they might keep the item.
4.3 Discussion
Our survey was not designed to yield a form factor that is “best”
without really knowing yet what that means or who the target
users of secret sharing might be. For this reason we did not expose
participants to the complexity of secret sharing in our survey sce-
nario. We rather wished to validate whether our brainstorming led
us in the right direction. The outcome was meant to be a choice of
two form factors that are feasible and which we can explore and
compare in the course of a eld experiment.
Based on the survey results we chose to move forward with the
key tag (without the key) and paper sheets. The key with tag was a
clear preference of participants both overall and as a rst choice.
Going forward we did not want to measure how well users retrieve
a physical key but the share of a digital key encoded on the key tag.
Secondly, we were curious whether condants would keep the key
tag where they keep physical keys, which would suggest that they
indeed associate digital keys with physical ones.
Paper sheets and portable storage media were close overall but
media were given a higher rank on average (1.9 versus 2.3). On
the other hand, our survey sampled object preferences from the
perspective of condants, that is, the ones who receive and keep
shares rather than the ones who distribute them. Users who wish
to produce shares can often produce paper shares conveniently
because they own a printer or have access to one. Storage media are
less likely kept in stock and they are signicantly more expensive
per unit. Additionally, storage media may incur higher postage fees
when being mailed to condants. Lastly, paper sheets t our oine
scenario better then storage media.
The majority of participants volunteered a place where they
would keep the item they are entrusted with. This reassured us that
pairing by association is worth studying in the context of secret
sharing.
4.4 Limitations
4.4.1
Internal Validity. We made sure that we presented all op-
tions in a neutral fashion, that is, without suggesting that any

option is more desirable than another. By interviewing only in-
dividuals who were alone we avoided any eects attributable to
group dynamics that might cause participants from deviating from
their true opinion. Our scenario was highly specic with respect to
our research objective. Overall we expect to have achieved good
internal validity.
4.4.2 External Validity. Our survey is not suited as a basis for
generalization. The number of participants is too small and our
participants (students) are too specic a demographic. However,
generalizing to a larger population was not our goal. On the con-
trary, studies with large numbers of participants may not be advis-
able at this point because little is known about the populations that
might be the users of secret sharing applications. Despite its lack
of external validity, our survey served its purpose to crystallize our
thoughts on what form factors to study further.
5 FIELD STUDY
Secret sharing involves the processes (a) key generation, (b) share
generation, (c) share distribution, (d) share retrieval and (e) key
recovery. Our eld study focused on (c) and (d); we simulated the
other processes on behalf of study participants. Instead of comput-
ing actual shares we used information that helped us track how
the eld study progressed. Before we report the details of our eld
study we specify more precisely our terminology and the roles
individuals played in it.
The Experimenter is the individual or group of individuals
who conduct an empirical study (us). Towards this end, the
experimenter signs up participants.
A participant is an individual who has consented to partici-
pate in the study of the experimenter. He (or she, henceforth
he) receives key shares from the experimenter and distributes
them to condants. Towards this end, the participant signs
up condants. After some time, when instructed by the ex-
perimenter, he requests that the condants shall return the
key shares to him, receives them, and returns them to the
experimenter.
A condant is an individual who agrees to keep a key share
on behalf of the participant and to return it upon request by
the participant.
We conducted a eld study in order to observe and measure how
participants carry out the share distribution task and the corre-
sponding retrieval task, using two dierent form factors T and P.
Besides collecting quantitative and qualitative data for subsequent
analysis we intended to verify the following research hypothesis:
Research hypothesis: Form factors T and P lead to dierent
recovery rates in a k out of n secret sharing scheme, that is,
dierent numbers of successful key recoveries (retrieval of
k or more shares).
Null hypothesis: Form factors T and P have no eect on the
recovery rate of a k out of n secret sharing scheme.

up 5 condants. Hence, given ` participants, the overall number of
individuals involved in the study was 6 · ` plus the experimenter.
5.1 Methods
In what follows we rst give an overview over the entire study
process. The study proceeded in six stages.
5.1.1
Solicitation of Participation. We posted 50 posters on pin-
boards across our university’s campus. In each poster, we solicited
participation in our study and provided contact information. Ad-
ditionally, we sent similar invitations to the mailing lists of the
computer science institute and the institute of scientic studies
of religion. Our solicitation oered a compensation of e 10. Ad-
ditionally, participants were promised a lottery draw among the
participants in which one participant would win a e 100 Amazon
Gift Card.
5.1.2 Group Assignment. When an individual contacted us for
the rst time and indicated interest in participating in our study
we assigned him to form factor group T or P in an alternating
fashion. If the individual did not follow through for some reason
(for example, a no-show at the brieng) then we lled his slot with
another individual on a rst-come rst-serve basis. In this fashion
we rendered the assignment of participants to experimental groups
independent of the choices of the experimenter and the participants.
5.1.3 Briefing. We invited participants to individual briengs.
All briengs took place in the same room in our research group’s
oces. All briengs were conducted by the same experimenter.
Participants received a succinct description of the purpose and the
procedures of our study and had to summarize the contents verbally.
The experimenter verbally briefed each participant once again,
oered to answer additional questions and answered questions if
participants asked them.
Participants were asked not to brief condants about the purpose
of the study but to simply tell them that the item they were asked to
keep (the key share) was part of an empirical study and that it would
be requested back eventually. Participants were asked to give only
one share to each condant and only if the condant had not already
received a share from somebody else. Lastly, participants had to
ask condants to register their shares at a website we provided.
The experimenter demonstrated the registration process to each
participant using a dummy share.
Participants were asked to give informed consent for their par-
ticipation in the study and they were informed that they could end
their participation at any time without giving a reason. If they gave
consent then the experimenter gave them ve shares each. The
form factor was T or P according to each participant’s group. We
did not tell participants that there were form factors other than the
one they received or that there were multiple groups. Finally, the
experimenter provided a URL to a post-brieng online survey and
asked the participant to take the survey once they had distributed
their shares.
For practical reasons we limited ourselves to exploring only one
choice of k and n. We chose k = 3, n = 5. This keeps the burden
on participants reasonable while allowing for some variance in the
return rates. In other words, each participant was asked to sign

design was whether participants really distribute the shares or keep
