User: [New Note: I cannot install through binstar or anaconda.  Why can't I install in python, outside of anaconda?  Is there a way to get my computer to stop using the anaconda install of python when I don't luanch it specifically through the continuum launcher?]
I have an install of Python 2.7 on a windows machine. I just recently installed Anaconda, in addition.
I just tried to install a new module for my Python install.  I opened a command prompt in an unzipped folder for a python module and ran:

python setup.py install

However, I experienced an error at build line:

building 'pyodbc' extension

The ultimate error line reads:

error: command 'gcc' failed with exit status 1

It appears to have looked for and not found several files or directories.  For example, I received several (7) lines of error like:

gcc.exe: error: /Wall: No such file or directory

I have a wild hunch that the install of Anaconda is upsetting my PATH variables (or something), but it's just a hunch. 
Thanks kindly.
Assistant: I suggest trying "conda install" + PackageName. If it fails installing using conda, it may automatically jump to using pip with success.
