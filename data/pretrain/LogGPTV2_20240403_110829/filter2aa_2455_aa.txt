### Introduction
This presentation is not about why privacy is important; it focuses on the practical steps you can take to protect your privacy. If you need to know the "why," you might consider sharing your full name, date of birth, and Social Security Number (SSN) with me. However, this would be counterproductive, as it would expose you to the very risks we aim to mitigate.

### Key Principle: Non-Existence of Information
If information does not exist, it cannot:
- Be used against you
- Be used for you
- Be subpoenaed
- Be stolen or lost

This principle is fundamental to maintaining privacy.

---

### Costs of Privacy
Privacy often comes at a cost, which may include:
- No reward points (e.g., airlines, hotels, grocery stores)
- Higher fees at retail stores
- No subscription discounts
- No credit card benefits (e.g., buyer protection)
- No insurance coverage for belongings

Are you willing to pay these costs for the sake of privacy?

### What Are You Protecting?
Before implementing privacy measures, identify what you are trying to protect:
- Your name and identity
- Where you live
- Your spending habits
- Your hobbies
- Medical information
- Travel history
- Employment details
- Income information
- Personal identifying information (PII)

---

### Who Is the Threat?
Consider who might be interested in your data:
- Nosy boss
- Nosy neighbor/housemate
- Ex-partner
- Former professional associates
- Random targets of opportunity
- Individuals you may have inadvertently offended
- Government agencies
- Large corporations

Different entities have different motivations for seeking your data. Think carefully before sharing it.

### The Business Perspective
"Companies are eager to obtain a 360-degree view of their customers, enabling them to sell, service, market, cross-sell, and update from a unified customer history."
— *Information Week*, April 5, 2004, p. 67

---

### Trust and Privacy
- **Trust**: Do you trust everyone that the trusted person trusts? Will they handle your information as you wish?
- **Consequences**: What happens if someone or a company violates that trust? Are there repercussions?
- **Believability**: Can you trust companies, especially when you have no choice but to deal with them?
- **Definition of Trust**: Black Unicorn, speaking at the 12th USENIX Security Symposium, defined trust as "reliance on something in the future; hope."

### Level of Privacy Achieved
When making decisions about privacy, consider the level of privacy you desire and the level your actions will achieve. For example, a P.O. Box is useful, but you must provide two forms of ID and your real address. While it won't deter determined individuals, it can keep casual observers from knowing your residence.

---

### Common Mistakes
Even a single slip can compromise your privacy:
- Posting directions to your house online
- A relative sending a package to your home using your real name
- An email being forwarded to a public mailing list
- A business requiring non-cash payment
- A roommate's legal troubles

### Identification
"A name is no longer just an identifier; it is the key to a vast, cross-referenced system of public and private databases, revealing the most intimate aspects of an individual's life."
— SanLuisObispo.com editorial, June 23, 2004, referencing an EFF amicus brief on the Larry Hiibel v. Sixth Judicial District Court of Nevada case.

#### Tips for Identification:
- **Passport**: Use it as your primary identification, except while driving. It has no address listed, no SSN, and is universally accepted.
- **SSN**: Remove it from your wallet. Cut it out of medical cards if necessary and get a new driver’s license.
- **Alias**: Use an alias carefully to avoid being accused of "intent to defraud." Consider using an alias when asked for photo ID.
- **Limited Liability Company (LLC)**: Conduct some activities under an LLC.

---

### Money
- **Basic Tips**:
  - Use cash for local transactions and barter services.
  - Use cashier’s checks, money orders, or traveler’s checks from non-bank sources.
  - Find places that don’t require ID for exchanging money.
  
- **Advanced Options**:
  - Print checks from your LLC.
  - Use a proxy agent, like a trusted friend earning miles on their credit card.
  - Use disposable credit cards (though they are more for anti-fraud than privacy).

- **Avoid**:
  - Credit cards
  - Debit cards
  - PayPal
  - Wire transfers
  - Moving large amounts of money at once

- **Credit Card Concerns**:
  - Credit card companies share your address with stores.
  - They report balances to credit bureaus monthly.
  - Transactions can be location-specific, revealing your whereabouts.

- **Cash Concerns**:
  - Large cash transactions raise suspicions.
  - Purchasing big-ticket items with cash can be problematic.
  - Consider the trade-offs, such as not appearing to be involved in illegal activities.

- **Legal Issues**:
  - **IRS Form 4789 (Currency Transaction Report)**: For transactions of $10,000 or more.
  - **US Customs Form 4790 (Report of International Transportation of Currency or Monetary Instruments)**: For international transactions of $10,000 or more.
  - **Suspicious Activity Report (SAR)**: Required for suspicious transactions.
  - **Bank Secrecy Act - Monetary Instrument Sales Records**: For cash sales of bank checks, drafts, cashier’s checks, money orders, and traveler’s checks between $3,000 and $10,000.

- **Getting Cash**:
  - Banks are the most common source.
  - Direct deposit vs. paper checks.
  - Trust in financial institutions.
  - ATM security and the PATRIOT Act.
  - Customer Identification Program (CIP) and LexisNexis Anti-Money Laundering Solution.

- **Financial Security**:
  - Use non-obvious passwords for financial accounts.
  - Avoid convenience checks.
  - Lock web accounts if not in use.
  - Check your credit report annually and consider a credit monitoring service.
  - Minimize the footprint on your checks.
  - Document the location of any cash stash securely.

### Transportation
- **Auto Purchase at Dealer**:
  - **On Credit**: Expect to provide extensive personal information.
  - **Payment on Delivery**: Provide real name, physical address, SSN, and DOB.
  - **LLC Purchase**: Have your LLC make the purchase.

- **Auto Purchase from Private Party**:
  - **Private Sale**: Typically requires only money and a signature.
  - **Pre-Approved Loan**: Requires full disclosure.
  - **Borrowing from Friends/Family**: Consider self-financing options.
