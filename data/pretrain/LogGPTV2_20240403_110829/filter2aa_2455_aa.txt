What are you talking about?
The focus here is not a ‘why’ talk, we’re talking 
the how.
If you need to know why, leave your full name, 
DOB and SSN with me and I’ll get back to you 
(perhaps you’ll get back to yourself).

If information doesn’t exist, it can’t be
• Used against you
• Used for you
• Subpoenaed
• Stolen or lost

Privacy may not be free and there may be a direct 
cost to being anonymous:
- No award points (airlines, hotels, grocery store) 
- Higher fees at retail stores (grocery store)
- No subscription discounts
- No credit card benefits (buyer protection)
- No insurance on belongings
Privacy can have monetary costs. 
Are you willing to pay?

Your name and who you are?
Where you live?
What you spend your money on?
Your hobbies?
Why you visited the doctor?
Where you travel to?
Where you work?
How much you (don’t) make?
Your personal identifying information?
Before thinking about protecting your privacy, 
ask what is it that you are trying to protect?

Nosy boss?
Nosy neighbor/house mate?
Ex-lover?
Former “professional” associate?
Random target of opportunity?
Someone you accidentally pissed off?
The Feds?
Big Business?
Different people want data for different reasons. 
Think before you give it up.
Before thinking about protecting your privacy, 
ask who is the threat?

“A 360-degree view of the customer is so 
tantalizing that most companies are 
virtually drooling over the prospect of 
being able to sell, service, market, cross-
sell, and update sell from a common view 
of a customer’s history.

• Do you trust everyone the trusted person trusts? 
Will these people handle your information per 
your wishes? 
• What happens when a person or company 
violates that trust? Are there consequences?
• Can you believe companies? Sometimes there is 
not a choice in who you’re dealing with.
• Black Unicorn, speaking at the 12th USENIX 
Security Symposium, called trust “reliance on 
something in the future; hope.”
Who do you trust?

Level of Privacy Achieved
When making an informed decision about privacy, 
ask yourself what is the level of privacy desired 
and the level that your actions will achieve.
A P.O. Box is great, however you must show two 
forms of ID including a driver’s license (passport 
can be 2nd form) and provide your real address. 
This isn’t going to stop people serious about 
finding you, but it keeps the casual observer from 
knowing your place of residence.

Oops
If you’re serious about protecting your private 
information, one slip means your privacy is lost.
- Directions to your house for a party posted online.
- Relative sends you a package to your home using 
your real name.
- E-mail is forwarded to a public mailing list.
- Business doesn’t take cash and you NEED the 
item or service they are providing.
- Roommate busted for drug possession.

Identification
“A name is no longer a simple identifier: It 
is the key to a vast, cross-referenced 
system of public and private databases, 
which lay bare the most intimate features 
of an individuals life.”

amicus brief on the Larry Hiibel v. Sixth Judicial District Court of 
Nevada.

Identification
• Use your passport as primary means of 
identification, except while driving.
– No address listed, SSN never listed
– Universally accepted (not the post office but…)
– No magnetic strip for data collection, but still 
machine readable (local bar won’t have this gear)
• Get rid of your SSN from your wallet
– Cut it out of medical cards if needed
– Get a new driver’s license

Identification
• If you use an alias, make sure its use is not taken as 
“intent to defraud”.1
• Are you asked to present a photo ID when filling out a 
form? Good candidate for using an alias.
• Can things be done in the name of a Limited Liability 
Company?

Money
Spending It
• Basic
– Where possible, deal in cash. Buy locally. Barter services.
– Cashier’s checks & money orders or travelers checks not 
from your bank (will cost $)
– Exchanging money – find someplace that doesn’t require ID.
• Advanced options:
– Print your own checks from your Limited Liability Company.
– Proxy agent. Got a trusted friend earning miles on their credit 
card?
– Disposable credit cards (more for anti-fraud than privacy 
since tied to main credit card). AMEX shut their program 
down; Citibank and MBNA have programs.

Spending It
• Avoid

– Worse are debit cards
– PayPal. Good for fraud, bad for privacy.
– Wire transfers. Too harsh ID requirements on either end.
– Moving large amounts of money at one time

Besides giving credit card companies a complete list of 
where you shop and what you purchase also consider:
• Credit card companies give stores your 
address information when using credit cards
• Credit card companies report balances to 
credit bureau every month (it’s in your credit 
card agreement) 
• Can be location specific. Terry was at the gas 
station at 2nd and Middleware at 2:20 am 
Saturday morning. Charge of $98 from 
backwoods motel on Wednesday July 15.

Concerns spending cash?
• Cash for plane tickets, will get flagged. Trade-off?
• Deposits (car rental, surfboard, bar tab, hotel rooms)
• Buying online
• Having cash serial #s recorded by company. Threat?
• Large cash transactions raise eyebrows
– Ever purchase a new car with cash?
• Trade offs:
– Don’t appear to be money laundering
– Don’t appear to be a drug dealer
– Returning big ticket items (>$100) paid for in cash can be a 
headache

Money
To spend money, you have to get it
• Chances are, you’ll get your cash from a bank
– Will your employer pay you cash? Unlikely these days
• Does your workplace require direct deposit or can you 
take a check on payday?
– Should your work know about your bank? Should your bank 
know about your place of employment?
• Is it OK to trust your financial institution?
– ATM vs. Live transactions
• Fake ATMs, false fronts, fake keypads, skimming devices
– PATRIOT ACT and divulging information
• Customer Identification Program, 5 yrs after closing acct.

Make sure it’s you that people are dealing with
• Put non-obvious passwords on all your financial 
accounts, replacing your social security number or 
mother’s maiden name. 
• Ask your credit card issuer not to send you 
convenience checks as you will never know when 
they go missing.
• Get your financial institutions to lock your web 
accounts if you don’t plan on using them.
• Check your credit report annually, think about paying 
for a credit monitoring service (but you’ll likely have to 
pay by credit card, what is the trade-off?).

• What information is on your check? Go with J. Smith 
(or the account is in the name of your Limited Liability 
Company right?). What does “J” stand for?
• Minimize the footprint. 1-888-5-OPTOUT for getting 
off pre-approved credit card mailings.
• Using cash means being responsible and reporting 
your cash income. This is for privacy, not avoiding

• If you have a cash stash, safely document it’s 
location someplace in the event of your untimely

Auto purchase - private party

to give it all up
• Opportunity to borrow from a friend or family (issues 
of lending friends money not addressed here). Will 
the seller self finance?
