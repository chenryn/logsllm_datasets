## Abstract

Internet Protocol (IP) cameras have become ubiquitous in providing physical security, enhancing safety, and preventing crime for organizations, businesses, and personal users worldwide. However, recent studies suggest that IP cameras often lack adequate security measures and can be easily exploited by malicious actors to infringe on user privacy and pose even greater threats. This study focuses on IP cameras with no password protection. We conducted a large-scale empirical investigation of such IP cameras using insecam.org, an online directory claiming to be the largest repository of IP cameras globally. Over a continuous period of 18 days, we monitored the site and collected daily data to analyze the number of active and new IP cameras, infer usage patterns, and perform a comprehensive characteristic analysis of these cameras. This analysis included examining the most used TCP/UDP ports, manufacturers, installation locations, ISPs, and countries. Additionally, we explored other potential security issues beyond the absence of password protection. Using an IP scanning tool, we discovered hidden hosts and services on the internal networks where vulnerable IP cameras are located and performed a vulnerability analysis. Our findings provide valuable insights into the threat landscape faced by IP cameras.

## 1. Introduction

An Internet Protocol (IP) camera is a video camera connected to a small web server, allowing access via Internet protocols. With increasing security needs and the development of IoT technologies, IP cameras are widely used to monitor areas such as offices, homes, and public spaces. However, recent reports and studies have shown that IP cameras often have suboptimal security, making them vulnerable to exploitation. Miscreants can fully control these devices, infringing on user privacy and launching large-scale DDoS attacks.

Username and password authentication is the most common method to prevent unauthorized access. However, a significant number of IP cameras are found to have no password protection, and their live video feeds are streamed on insecam.org, a popular website with hundreds of thousands of daily visitors. Previous works have focused on summarizing vulnerabilities and suggesting mitigation strategies. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth, large-scale quantitative evaluation of vulnerable IP cameras with no password protection based on data from insecam.org. We collected data over 18 days, observing 28,386 unique IP cameras from 31 time zones, 136 countries, and 25 manufacturers. We also analyzed historical records of IP cameras and conducted a vulnerability analysis of the internal networks where these cameras reside.

Our work is the first measurement study on IP cameras using insecam.org as a data source. Assuming the information posted on insecam.org is accurate, our key findings include:
1. Approximately 20,000 to 25,000 active cameras are shown on insecam.org each day, with an average of 215 new cameras added daily.
2. 87.4% of IP cameras on insecam.org are from Europe, East Asia, and North America, with the United States contributing 22.5%.
3. Monitoring the on/off state of IP cameras reveals usage patterns.
4. More than half of the cameras are from two manufacturers, Defeway and Axis.
5. A third of IP cameras use port 80 for administrative communication.
6. About a quarter of hosts where IP cameras reside have remote access ports 22 (SSH) and 23 (Telnet) open, increasing vulnerability.
7. Nearly all these cameras run outdated and vulnerable web server software, with many bearing multiple CVE vulnerabilities.

We believe our findings provide valuable knowledge about the threat landscape faced by IP cameras.

## 2. Background

### 2.1. IP Cameras

An IP camera contains a CPU, memory, and runs software, enabling it to communicate with other devices and be remotely controlled. Unlike CCTV cameras, IP cameras offer remote access features for administration and video monitoring. However, this remote accessibility can be exploited, especially when users use default settings and credentials.

### 2.2. insecam.org

insecam.org, which has existed since September 2014, claims to be the world's largest directory of networked live IP video cameras. The site gained media attention in November 2014 when it was reported to provide a directory of countless private IP cameras streaming privacy-sensitive live video feeds. Since then, the site administrator has enforced stricter policies, but there are still hundreds of thousands of IP cameras listed without their owners' awareness. All IP cameras on insecam.org are accessible without any authentication, and their live video streams can be viewed by anyone.

## 3. Measurement Methodology and Dataset

### 3.1. Data Collection

insecam.org collects a large set of currently active IP cameras with no password protection. For each active IP camera, the site streams its live video feed and provides metadata, including IP address, port, manufacturer, geolocation, and a tag describing the video content. We built a Python crawler to collect this information, running it at least four times daily at six-hour intervals. We also queried an online IP geolocation database to obtain ISP information.

### 3.2. Historical Data

Based on the observation that camera IDs on insecam.org are integers with many missing values, we assumed sequential ID assignment and collected metadata for 290,344 IP cameras, including 28,386 active ones. We conjecture that insecam.org has posted at least 560,293 unique, vulnerable IP cameras since its creation, with 290,344 (51.8%) still leaving "crumbs" for tracking.

### 3.3. Ethical Considerations

We collected data from the publicly available insecam.org for 18 days, anonymizing the metadata and abiding by copyright licenses. Our work does not introduce additional risks to insecam.org or the owners of the listed IP cameras.

## 4. Dynamics of insecam.org

We examined the dynamics of insecam.org based on collected data. Our findings include:
- The number of active IP cameras ranges from 20,000 to 25,000 daily, with an average of 215 new cameras added daily.
- 87.4% of IP cameras are from Europe, East Asia, and North America, with the United States contributing 22.5%.
- Monitoring the on/off state of IP cameras reveals usage patterns.
- More than half of the cameras are from two manufacturers, Defeway and Axis.
- A third of IP cameras use port 80 for administrative communication.
- About a quarter of hosts have remote access ports 22 (SSH) and 23 (Telnet) open, increasing vulnerability.
- Nearly all these cameras run outdated and vulnerable web server software, with many bearing multiple CVE vulnerabilities.
