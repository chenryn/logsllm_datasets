Abstract. Internet Protocol (IP) cameras have become virtually
omnipresent for organizations, businesses, and personal users across the
world, for the purposes of providing physical security, increasing safety,
and preventing crime. However, recent studies suggest that IP cameras
contain less than ideal security and could be easily exploited by mis-
creants to infringe user privacy and cause even bigger threats. In this
study, we focus on the IP cameras without any password protection. We
conduct a large-scale empirical investigation of such IP cameras based
on insecam.org, an online directory of IP cameras, which claims to be
the largest one in the world. To this end, we have monitored the site and
studied its dynamics with daily data collection over a continuous period
of 18 days. We compute daily number of active IP cameras and new cam-
eras on the site, and infer people’s usage habit of IP cameras. In addi-
tion, we perform a comprehensive characteristic analysis of IP cameras
in terms of the most used TCP/UDP ports, manufactures, installation
location, ISPs, and countries. Furthermore, we explore other possibly
existing security issues with those cameras in addition to no password
protection. We utilize an IP scanning tool to discover the hidden hosts
and services on the internal network where a vulnerable IP camera is
located, and then perform a vulnerability analysis. We believe our ﬁnd-
ings can provide valuable knowledge of the threat landscape that IP
cameras are exposed to.

1 Introduction
An Internet Protocol (IP) camera refers to a video camera which is attached to
a small web server and allows the access to it via Internet protocols. Along with

the growing security needs and the development of IoT technologies, IP cameras
are being widely used to monitor areas such as oﬃces, houses, and public spaces.
However, recent reports [8,10,11] and studies [12,16] have shown that IP cameras
contain less than ideal security, and could be exploited and fully controlled by
miscreants to infringe user privacy and even launch large-scale DDoS attacks
[4,9,14].
Username and password is the most widely used form of authentication
in practice to prevent unauthorized access. However, an incredible number of
IP cameras are found to have no password protection (or more exactly, with
password of null or empty) and are having their live video feeds streamed on
insecam.org, a popular website with hundreds of thousands of visitors daily.
Most previous works mainly focus on summarizing various vulnerabilities
of IP cameras and making suggestions on potential mitigation solutions. In this
paper, based on the data provided by the site insecam about its listed IP cameras,
we conduct an in-depth, large-scale quantitative evaluation of vulnerable IP
cameras with no password protection. Speciﬁcally, we performed daily collection
on insecam over a continuous period of 18 days. As a result, we observed 28,386
unique IP cameras, from 31 timezones1, 136 countries, and 25 manufacturers,
streaming their live video feeds on insecam without awareness of IP camera
owners. In addition to those currently active IP cameras, we managed to exhaust
and collect all the history records of IP cameras ever streaming on insecam, with
a total number of 290,344. We then performed a comprehensively characteristic
analysis of those IP cameras and also conducted vulnerability analysis of the
internal networks where those IP cameras reside with an attempt to identify
more vulnerabilities.
Our work is the ﬁrst measurement study on IP cameras using insecam.org
as a data source. Based on the assumption that all the information posted on
insecam about the IP cameras is correct, we highlight the following ﬁndings: (1)
there are about 20,000 to 25,000 active cameras shown on insecam each day and
215 new cameras are added daily on average; (2) 87.4% IP cameras on insecam
are from the three geographic regions - Europe, East Asia, and North America,
while United States alone contributes 22.5% of those cameras; (3) monitoring the
on/oﬀ state of IP cameras could reveal usage habit of IP cameras; (4) more than
a half of cameras are from the two manufacturers, Defeway and Axis; (5) a third
of IP cameras use the port 80 to communicate to their administrative interface;
(6) about a quarter of hosts where an IP camera resides have remote access ports
22 (SSH) and 23 (Telnet) open, which make them more vulnerable to attack-
ers; (7) nearly all those cameras were running extremely old and vulnerable web
server software, most of which are found to bear tens of CVE (Common Vulnerabil-
ities and Exposures) vulnerabilities. We believe our ﬁndings can provide valuable
knowledge of the threat landscape that IP cameras are facing.

2 Background
In this section, we brieﬂy introduce IP cameras and the site insecam.org.
IP cameras. An IP camera contains a CPU and memory, runs software, and
has a network interface that allows it to communicate to other devices and be
remotely controlled by users. Diﬀerent from CCTV cameras (closed-circuit tele-
vision cameras), IP cameras have the remote access features for administration
and video monitoring. However, the remote accessibility can be exploited by a
hacker, especially when users adopt default settings and credentials for the web
administrative interface.
insecam.org. This site is reported to have existed since September 2014. It is
claimed to be the world largest directory of network live IP video cameras. The
ﬁrst time the site attracted media attention was in November 2014 [8,10,11],
when journalists reported that the site provided a directory for countless private
IP cameras which streamed privacy-sensitive live video feeds. Since then, the site
administrator seems to have enforced strict policies that only ﬁltered IP cameras
can be added to the directory. However, there are still hundreds of thousands
of IP cameras listed on the site without their owners’ awareness. In addition,
all IP cameras on insecam are accessible without any authentication (i.e., no
password protection) and the live video stream can be directly viewed by any
visitors across the world.
3 Measurement Methodology and Dataset
insecam.org collects a large set of currently active IP cameras that have no
password protection. And those cameras seem not to be remotely controlled or
interfered by insecam. According to the policy described on the homepage of
insecam [7], anyone could request the site administrators to add an IP camera
to the directory by providing the IP and port of the camera. For each active
IP camera, insecam streams its live video feeds on the site for visitors to watch
and also provides relevant metadata information including the camera IP, port,
manufacturer, geolocation information (country, city, and timezone), and a tag
describing the subject of the video feed (e.g., animal, street) if available. An IP
camera turned oﬀ by its owner cannot be accessed on insecam, and thus the total
number of active cameras shown on insecam is always changing. In addition, each
IP camera is assigned a unique ID by insecam and the ID of an IP camera could
usually lead to a webpage displaying the IP camera metadata information.
Our general goal is to evaluate the seriousness of security issues with vulner-
able IP cameras through the study on insecam. Our measurement methodology
is driven by three speciﬁc goals. First, we wish to examine the dynamics of inse-
cam in terms of daily number of active IP cameras and new cameras on the site.
Second, we want to characterize those IP cameras without password protection
in terms of their manufacturers, installation location, ISPs, and countries. Third,
we want to explore the possibility that a vulnerable camera could be leveraged
as a pivot point onto the internal network.

H. Xu et al.
We built a Python crawler that allows us to automatically collect the informa-
tion about the IP cameras posted on insecam. Considering the always changing
number of active cameras due to turning on or oﬀ, we ran the crawler at least
four times each day at six-hour time interval. The collected information suﬃces
for our purposes of examining insecam dynamics and characterizing IP cam-
eras, except the information about what ISPs are hosting those vulnerable IP
cameras. We then queried the IP addresses of insecam cameras in an online IP
geolocation database [5] to obtain the corresponding ISP information.
In addition, based on the observation that the camera IDs on insecam are all
integers and the camera IDs in our collected dataset have many missing values,
we assume that insecam assigns sequential IDs to its cameras, and conjecture
that those missing camera IDs correspond to the IP cameras which were ever
collected on insecam but are currently not accessible due to either no longer
working or password setup. We ran the crawler to request the corresponding
web pages for the camera metadata information. In this way, we believe we are
able to exhaust or at least very close to collect all the history records of IP
cameras ever appearing on insecam.
We also utilized an IP scanning tool [1] to discover the hidden hosts and
services which co-reside with the vulnerable IP cameras in the same internal
network. We paid special attention to the services (e.g., SSH and Telnet) which
are often probed by attackers as the starting point for further attacks. We then
performed vulnerability analysis based on the collected co-residing information.
Dataset. Through daily data collection over a continuous period of 18 days,
from September 25, 2017 to October 12, 2017, we have observed 28,386 unique,
active IP cameras listed on insecam, which are from 31 timezones, 136 countries,
and 25 manufacturers. For each of them, we collected its metadata information
displayed on insecam, and probed it several times a day in the following days
to determine its on/oﬀ state at that time. In addition, based on the observation
that the minimum and maximum values of the IDs assigned by insecam for
still active IP cameras are 1 and 560,293, respectively, we queried all camera
IDs falling within [1, 570, 000] one by one in insecam, and ﬁnally were able to
collect the metadata information for 290,344 IP cameras (28,386 active ones
included), for each of which insecam still maintains a webpage. We conjecture
that insecam at least has posted 560,293 unique, vulnerable IP cameras in the
past three years since the website was created; currently 290,344 (51.8%) of them
still left “crumbs” for us able to track, and the reason why the information about
the rest 48.2% cameras is totally missing on insecam is still an open question; the
currently active IP cameras only occupy at most 5.1% (28,386 out of 560,293)
of all IP cameras ever disclosed by insecam.
Ethical Consideration. In our study, we collect data from insecam, a publicly
available website, for 18 days. During our data collection, we did not receive any
concerns or get warnings from insecam. In addition, we anonymized the collected
metadata information before using it for study. We strictly abide by the copyright
licenses if present. Therefore, our work will not introduce any additional risk to
insecam or the owners of the IP cameras listed on insecam.
