Abstract
We consider the following problem: how can two de-
vices that do not share any secrets establish a shared secret
key over a wireless radio channel in the presence of a com-
munication jammer? An inherent challenge in solving this
problem is that known anti-jamming techniques (e.g., fre-
quency hopping or direct-sequence spread spectrum) which
should support device communication during the key estab-
lishment require that the devices share a secret spreading
key (or code) prior to the start of their communication. This
requirement creates a circular dependency between anti-
jamming spread-spectrum communication and key estab-
lishment, which has so far not been addressed. In this work,
we propose an Uncoordinated Frequency Hopping (UFH)
scheme that breaks this dependency and enables key estab-
lishment in the presence of a communication jammer. We
perform a detailed analysis of our UFH scheme and show
its feasibility, both in terms of execution time and resource
requirements.
1. Introduction
The broadcast nature of wireless radio transmissions
makes them particularly vulnerable to communication jam-
ming Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. The aim of these
attacks is to prevent devices from exchanging any useful
information by interfering with their communication. Pos-
sible communication jamming attacks include signal an-
nihilation, modiﬁcation (bit-ﬂipping, overshadowing) and
jamming as well as the insertion of forged or replayed sig-
nals [2, 16, 20].

A class of well-known countermeasures against commu-
nication jamming attacks are spread-spectrum techniques
such as frequency hopping, direct-sequence spread spec-
trum, and chirp spread spectrum [16]. Common to all these
techniques is that they rely on secret (spreading) codes that
are shared between the communication partners. These se-
cret codes enable the sender to spread the signal (in time
and/or frequency) such that its transmission becomes un-
predictable for a third party, thus reducing the probability
of interference. However, for these schemes to work, the
required secret code must be shared between the partners
prior to their communication, generally precluding unan-
ticipated transmissions between unpaired devices. The re-
quirement of a shared code has so far been fulﬁlled by
out-of-band code pre-distribution on the devices. This ap-
proach has scalability disadvantages in environments where
a large number of nodes potentially take part in a pairwise
communication.
If pre-sharing the codes is not adequate or even infeasi-
ble (e.g., due to a large number of nodes or high network
membership dynamics) the devices must agree on a secret
code in an ad-hoc manner using the wireless channel. This
observation leads to the following problem: How can two
devices that do not share any secrets establish a shared se-
cret key over a wireless radio channel in the presence of a
communication jammer (in order to derive a secret spread-
ing code from the established key)? The execution of a key
establishment protocol relies on jamming-resistant commu-
nication which, in turn, requires the availability of a shared
secret code.
In other words, the dependency of spread-
spectrum techniques on a shared key (or code) and the
dependency of key establishment on a jamming-resistant
communication create a circular dependency, which we
call anti-jamming/key-establishment dependency (see Fig-

dependency graphs.
(a) If two devices do
not share any secret keys or codes and want
to execute a key establishment protocol in
the presence of a jammer, they have to use
a jamming-resistant communication. How-
ever, known anti-jamming techniques such
as frequency hopping and direct-sequence
spread spectrum rely on secret (spreading)
codes that are shared between the communi-
cation partners prior to the start of their com-
munication.
(b) In this work, we break this
dependency and propose a novel frequency
hopping scheme called Uncoordinated Fre-
quency Hopping (UFH) that enables two par-
ties to execute a key establishment protocol
in the presence of a jammer, even if the par-
ties do not yet share a secret key or code.
ure 1(a)). To the best of our knowledge, this circular depen-
dency has so far not been addressed in this setting. We point
out that, even if the nodes hold their public-key certiﬁcates
issued by a commonly trusted authority, they still need to
communicate in order to establish the secret spreading key
(code) required for the jamming-resistant communication
(e.g., using an authenticated Difﬁe-Hellman key establish-
ment protocol).
In our present work, we break the circular depen-
dency between anti-jamming spread-spectrum communica-
tion, shared secret keys (or codes), and key establishment
in a jammed environment (see Figure 1(b)). As a solution
to this circular dependency, we propose a scheme called
Uncoordinated Frequency Hopping (UFH) that enables the
jamming-resistant communication between two nodes in
the presence of a jammer without a pre-shared code. We
further show how to use this UFH scheme for executing a
key establishment protocol, which, in the presence of a jam-
mer, enables the nodes to agree on a shared secret key. The
nodes can then use this key to create a secret hopping se-
quence and communicate using coordinated frequency hop-
ping, thereby abandoning the use of the UFH scheme.
UFH is closely related to coordinated frequency hop-
ping: each message is split into multiple parts and then sent
Figure 2. Example of UFH. The numbers in-
dicate the frequency channels where sender
A is sending and receiver B is listening over
time (here both send and receive on one fre-
quency at a time).
If A and B send and re-
ceive simultaneously on the same frequency
(5 and 1 in the example) the packet sent
on this frequency is successfully transmitted

across the air on random hopping frequencies chosen from a
ﬁxed frequency band. Like coordinated frequency hopping,
UFH is based on the assumption that the attacker cannot
jam all frequency channels on which the nodes communi-
cate at the same time so that the sender and the receiver can
still communicate through the remaining channels. How-
ever, in UFH, the sender and the receiver do not agree on a
secret channel sequence but instead transmit and listen on
randomly selected channels. Hence, all communication in
UFH underlies the observation that, with sufﬁcient trans-
mission attempts, the sender and receiver will send and lis-
ten on the same channels in a number of time slots, even if
they did not agree on them beforehand (see Figure 2). In-
tuitively, given 500 channels and given a sender hopping
among the channels at a high rate of, for instance, 1500 Hz
and a receiver hopping at a low rate (e.g., 100 Hz), the re-
ceiver will be listening on the frequency where the sender
is transmitting in average 1500/500 = 3 times per second.
Building on this observation, we develop a UFH scheme
that is highly resistant to packet losses and active interfer-
ence by an attacker. It can, thus, be applied in settings where
two nodes wish to establish an unanticipated and sponta-
neous communication without pre-shared keys, which was
so far not feasible using coordinated frequency hopping.
In summary, the main contributions of this work are:
• We address and describe the anti-jamming/key-
establishment circular dependency problem:
anti-
jamming spread-spectrum communication techniques
rely on a shared (spreading) key and key establishment
relies on a jamming-resistant communication. This
leads to the following question: in the presence of a
communication jammer, how can two devices that do
not share any secrets establish a shared secret key over
a wireless radio channel?
• As one solution to the addressed problem, we propose
a scheme called UFH (Uncoordinated Frequency Hop-
ping) that enables two nodes to execute a key estab-
lishment protocol in the presence of a jammer; the es-

dinated frequency hopping communication. Our UFH
scheme supports the transmission of messages of arbi-
trary length in a jammed environment without relying
on a shared secret key.
• We introduce a comprehensive DoS attacker model
which captures signal jamming and overshadowing as
well as message insertion and modiﬁcation.
• We show that, although our UFH scheme achieves
lower communication throughput and incurs higher
storage and processing costs, it achieves the same level
of anti-jamming protection as (coordinated) frequency
hopping (which, however, unlike our UFH, cannot be
used in scenarios where devices do not share secret
spreading keys).
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: In
Section 2, we specify the system setting and attacker model.
We describe our jamming-resistant UFH scheme in Sec-
tion 3 and demonstrate its use for a key establishment proto-
col in Section 4. In Section 5, we identify possible attacker
strategies and provide a performance analysis of the pro-
posed scheme. We discuss related work in Section 6 and
conclude in Section 7.
2. System and Attacker Models
2.1. System Model
In our system, we focus on two nodes that reside within
each other’s power range, but are initially unaware of their
proximity. The goal of each node is to detect communica-
tion signals from other nodes in its communication neigh-
borhood and to establish communication with the detected
node. Each node is equipped with processing and storage
units, a clock, and a radio transceiving module capable of
frequency hopping communication. We assume that the
nodes are able to store few megabytes of data and can ef-
ﬁciently perform ECC-based public key cryptography. The
nodes share the same concept of time and their clocks are
assumed to be loosely synchronized in the order of seconds,
e.g., by means of GPS. The transceiver permits each node
to hop within a given set C of available radio frequencies
(spanning a large band of typically several hundred fre-
quencies, c =|C|). The transceiver can be narrowband or
broadband, enabling the node to send and receive signals
on one or more (hopping) frequencies simultaneously; by
cn and cm we denote the number of channels on which
a node can send and receive on, respectively. We assume
that the transceiver does not leak information about its ac-
tive reception channels, that is, that the channels on which
the transceiver is actively listening on cannot be detected
by monitoring its radio signal emissions. Furthermore, the
nodes can switch their input (listen) and output (send) chan-
nels independently of each other and are capable of per-
forming full duplex communications by sending and receiv-
ing in parallel.
We assume that sender A splits its available power uni-
formly over its cn output channels such that it transmits with
the same signal strength on all channels; Pa then denotes the
strength of the signal arriving at a receiver. With respect to
a speciﬁc receiver B, we denote by Pt the minimal required
signal strength at B such that B can successfully decode a
message (i.e., the sensitivity of B’s receiver). In this con-
text, the transmission between A and B over an undisturbed
channel will be successful if Pa ≥ Pt and if A sends on a
channel on which, at the same time, B is listening.
We further assume that each node holds a public/private
key pair (P K, SK) and is computationally capable of per-
forming public-key operations. The system is supported by
a trusted Certiﬁcation Authority (CA) that issues public-key
certiﬁcates binding node identities and their public keys.
The CA may be off-line or unreachable by the nodes at the
time of the intended communication, but we assume that
each node holds a valid certiﬁcate of its own public key
and the valid public key P KCA of the CA. Both were dis-
tributed during the system initialization phase (e.g., after the
procurement of the nodes).
2.2. Attacker Model
We consider an omnipresent but computationally
bounded adversary who controls the communication chan-
nel in the sense that she is able to eavesdrop and insert arbi-
trary messages, but can only modify transmitted messages
by adding her own energy-limited signals to the channel.
This means that the attacker’s ability to alter or erase a mes-
sage is restricted to interfering with the message transmis-
sion and that she cannot disable the communication channel
by blocking the propagation of radio signals (e.g., by plac-
ing a node in a Faraday’s cage).
The attacker’s goal is to interfere with the communica-
tion of the nodes in order to prevent them from exchang-
ing any useful information. That is, the attacker aims at
increasing (possibly indeﬁnitely) the time for the message
exchange in the most efﬁcient way.
In order to achieve
this goal, the attacker is not only restricted to message jam-
ming, but can also try to disturb the nodes’ communication
by modifying and inserting messages or by keeping one or
both nodes too busy to participate in or proceed with the
protocol. She can thus choose among the following actions:
• The attacker can insert messages that she generated
by using known (cryptographic) functions and keys as
well as by reusing (parts of) previously overheard mes-
sages (constituting a replay attack). Depending on the
signal strength of the inserted messages, these mes-
sages might interfere with regular transmissions.
