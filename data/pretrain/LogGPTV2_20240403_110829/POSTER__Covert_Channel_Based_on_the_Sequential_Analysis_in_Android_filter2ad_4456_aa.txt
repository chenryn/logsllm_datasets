ABSTRACT
Due to the wide spread of android smartphones, different types
of attacks have emerged against android systems and accordingly
many researches have been accomplished in the android security.
In particular, a variety of covert channels have been recently de-
veloped in android systems. They are usually built up by utilizing
physical media and distinct characteristics of systems in the litera-
ture. To the best of our information, however, we do not find out
any research work establishing covert channels in android systems
on basis of the sequential analysis, which is a kind of statistical deci-
sion theory. This is mainly because the sequential analysis has been
conventionally treated as defense technique in terms of security.
In contrast to this common application of the sequential analysis,
we discover a new covert channel based on the sequential analysis
in android systems. The key idea of newly devised covert channel
is to harness the sequential analysis in order to encode (resp. de-
code) private information bits to (resp. from) multiple sequences of
randomly selected data. Through simulation, we demonstrate that
our developed covert channel works efficiently and thus it could
be substantial threat to android systems.

1 INTRODUCTION
Covert channels are considered to be stealthy passages through
which private information can be leaked from systems in concealed
manner. Moreover, attacker can exploit covert channel to propagate
attack control messages to malicious entities. In this sense, covert
channels are substantial threat against the normal functions of sys-
tems and thus the considerable number of researches on them have
been achieved in variety of systems. In particular, covert channels
are harmful in android systems from the perspective that they could
be used to leak private information from android smartphones and
thus could menace the security of android ecosystem. In order to
defend against covert channels in android systems, it is thus very

imperative to discover as many kinds of covert channels as possible
that could operate in android systems. In order to fulfill this need,
a diversity of covert channels have been proposed in the litera-
ture. Lalande et al. [3] proposed several android covert channels
based on the task list, process priority, and screen state. Novak et
al. [4] designed various android covert channels with using phys-
ical media such as ultrasound, flash, vibration, camera, speaker,
and accelerometer. Qi et al. [5] exploited user behavior for covert
channel establishment.
Although these related work cover covert channels based on
various features of systems, user behavior, and physical media in
android smartphones, they do not consider covert channels rooted
on the sequential analysis. This is because the sequential analy-
sis [7] has been prevalently used as statistical decision process and
attack detection mechanism such as mobile sensor replica detec-
tion [1], port scan detection [2], and even covert channel detec-
tion [6], leading to exclusion from the stepping stones for covert
channel establishment. In contrast to these conventional applica-
tions of the sequential analysis, we discover a new covert channel
that harnesses the Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT) in the se-
quential analysis [7]. For the SPRT-based covert channel, we make
use of the fact that many android applications generally utilize that
diverse types of variable sensory and GPS data provided by android
systems. More specifically, the SPRT-based covert channel makes
the SPRT encode (resp. decode) private information bits to (resp.
from) multiple sequences of randomly chosen data. We believe
that the SPRT-based covert channel expands the extent of possible
covert channels in android systems, contributing to the research
of covert channel detection. We describe the details of our newly
devised covert channel and present the simulation results of it in
the following sections.
2 SPRT-BASED COVERT CHANNEL
ESTABLISHMENT
Most android smartphones are equipped with diverse sensors such
as accelerometer, ambient light and proximity sensors, gyroscope,
compass, and GPS systems. Hence, substantial number of android
applications use a variety of variable sensory and GPS data from
these sensors and GPS systems. For covert channel establishment,
although we can use any types of variable sensory and GPS data
provided by android systems, we focus on the location data consist-
ing of latitude and longitude in this paper. This is mainly because
many users make use of android applications sending location in-
formation to server in order to obtain location-related services.
Indeed, if we use a series of location data for covert channel
development, it will seem to be straightforward to design covert

encode and decode a single private information bit. However, this
method has the weakness that it is relatively easier to reveal the
private information bits from location values than using multiple
location information. To pacify this limitation, we propose the SPRT-
based covert channel in which the SPRT encodes (resp. decodes) a
single private information bit to (resp. from) a sequence of randomly
chosen location values and thus the number of location values used
for encoding and decoding processes are randomly determined,
leading to being difficult to unveil private information bits from
location information. Furthermore, the SPRT makes a decision with
a small amount of location information and hence it will require
little time to perform encoding and decoding processes. This will be
considerable benefit for the attacker in the sense that the likelihood
of being detected will be diminished.
How the SPRT is adapted to establish covert channel for private
information transmission from a trojan android application to a tro-
jan server is described as follows. Let us consider a trojan android
application that transmits its location information to the trojan
server in order to get the location-related services. We first assume
that trojan app owns private information leaked from android sys-
tems. We also assume that the attacker can obfuscate this trojan app
to avoid the static analysis detection and can install the obfuscated
version of trojan app in android smartphone. This assumption is
achievable because the attacker can develop his own obfuscation
mechanism for the evasion from static analysis detection. Moreover,
we assume that trojan app employs random selection process of
location information periodically obtained from android systems. In
this process, trojan app sends its location information to the trojan
server with a certain probability. This assumption is reasonable
in the sense that trojan app users will not likely have difficulty in
acquiring seamless location-related services as long as the time pe-
riod for location information collection is maintained as reasonably
small. Additionally, this random selection strategy has advantage
of reducing communication costs incurred by location information
transmission to the trojan server.
2.1 Encoding Private Information Bits
Let us first consider the encoding process for a private information
bit. When obtaining the first pair of latitude and longitude (A1,O1),
trojan app accepts (A1,O1). Each time obtaining a pair of latitude
and longitude (Ai ,Oi ) (i ≥ 2), trojan app performs random loca-
tion selection process in the following manner. If trojan app wishes
to encode private information bit 1 and both |Ai − Ai−1| ≥ δa
and |Oi − Oi−1| ≥ δo hold, it selects (Ai ,Oi ) with probability ps
(ps > 0.5) , where δa and δo are pre-configured thresholds. If tro-
jan app wishes to encode a private information bit 0 and both
|Ai − Ai−1| ≥ δa and |Oi − Oi−1| ≥ δo do not hold, it selects
(Ai ,Oi ) with probability ps. If all of the above two conditions do
not hold, it selects (Ai ,Oi ) with probability pu (pu < 0.5).

Trojan app performs the SPRT with only pairs (Ak ,Ok ) and
(Ak +1,Ok +1) that are chosen by random location selection process
(k ≥ 1). We first define the kth sample Dk as a Bernoulli random
