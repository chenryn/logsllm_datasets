User: Please introduce common monitoring tools and their application scenarios under Linux, such as sar, top, iostat, etc.
Assistant: 1. sar is a tool that can periodically collect system resource usage on a Linux system and record it in a log file. sarı is used to monitor system activity, especially when the load is high. sarı continuously monitors the system and regularly generates reports for system performance analysis and optimization. 2. top is a command-line utility that is used to display the processes running in the system and their occupancy of system resources. The top command provides an easy way to understand system performance and identify system bottlenecks. It can display various system information, such as CPU usage, memory usage, load, number and status of processes, etc. 3. iostat is a Linux tool for monitoring disk I/O performance. I/O is one of the slowest operations in a computer system, so iostat can be used to discover bottlenecks in the system and where they are located. Using iostat, you can monitor disk operations on your Linux system, including IOPS, MB/s, wait time and usage, etc. 4. vmstat is a Linux system tool for monitoring system virtual memory, process, CPU and I/O statistics. Through vmstat, you can observe the usage of system resources such as memory and CPU in real time, and find out the problematic process or statistical information in time. 5. netstat is a command-line utility for monitoring network activity. Using the netstat command, you can view all network-related connections in the current system. By using netstat, you can view the ports opened in the current system, TCP/UDP protocol status, network interface statistics and routing tables, etc. 6. htop is an internal process monitoring tool of Linux system, which is used to monitor the process information running in the system. htop is an enhanced version of the top command, with stronger interactivity and more functions, such as displaying process tree, multiple CPU cores and more process information, etc.
