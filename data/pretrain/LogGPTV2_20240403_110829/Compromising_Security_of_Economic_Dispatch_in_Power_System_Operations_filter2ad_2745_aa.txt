Abstract‚ÄîPower grid operations rely on the trustworthy op-
eration of critical control center functionalities, including the so-
called Economic Dispatch (ED) problem. The ED problem is a
large-scale optimization problem that is periodically solved by the
system operator to ensure the balance of supply and load while
maintaining reliability constraints. In this paper, we propose a
semantics-based attack generation and implementation approach
to study the security of the ED problem.1 Firstly, we generate
optimal attack vectors to transmission line ratings to induce
maximum congestion in the critical lines, resulting in the violation
of capacity limits. We formulate a bilevel optimization problem in
which the attacker chooses manipulations of line capacity ratings
to maximinimize the percentage line capacity violations under
linear power Ô¨Çows. We reformulate the bilevel problem as a mixed
integer linear program that can be solved efÔ¨Åciently. Secondly,
we describe how the optimal attack vectors can be implemented
in commercial energy management systems (EMSs). The attack
explores the dynamic memory space of the EMS, and replaces
the true line capacity ratings stored in data regions with the
optimal attack vectors. In contrast to the well-known false data
injection attacks to control systems that require compromising
distributed sensors, our approach directly implements attacks to
the control center server. Our experimental results on benchmark
power systems and Ô¨Åve widely utilized EMSs show the practical
feasibility of our attack generation and implementation approach.
I. INTRODUCTION
Critical national
infrastructure has become increasingly
complex. The power grid exempliÔ¨Åes a cyber-physical infras-
tructure, with data collected from its physical components
and processed by control algorithms running on computers to
provide for accurate and safe monitoring and control. Such
a large-scale trusted computing base introduces a hard-to-
protect attack surface. Events such as proliferation of the
Stuxnet worm [10], the coordinated attack on the Ukranian
power grid [5], and the emergence of new threats that leverage
existing weaknesses in these systems [23] demonstrate that
cyber-physical infrastructures are unprepared to maintain their
safe and secure operation in the face of malicious adversaries.
Despite the failures, the past intrusions had two features: i)
they mostly required full ownership of the target controllers
(e.g., Siemens Step7 server compromise by Stuxnet [10]) to
perform the attacks; and ii) they did not fully optimize their
adversarial impact via utilization of the underlying physical
model. A semantics-based attack can do a lot more using much
less resources. For instance, an attacker with access to only few
power system parameters can leverage its dynamical model to
calculate the malicious replacing parameter values such that
the ultimate damage to the power system is maximized.
In the literature, there has been an extensive body of work
on false data injection attacks [17], where the compromised
sensors send corrupted measurements to mislead the operators
regarding the power system state. Such attacks assume the
attacker can compromise a large number of geographically
and logically distributed set of sensors remotely. In addition
to the scalability barrier, remote malicious access to (ana-
log) sensors with serial connections may not be feasible in
practice. Additionally, by design, false data injection attacks
target sensors or actuators only, and cannot manipulate core
system parameters such as the network topology and line
parameters (e.g., capacities). This information often resides
within the control center servers and are used for power system
operations such as state estimation and operational control.
However, almost all the past real attacks (e.g., [5], [10]) against
critical infrastructures have targeted control center assets (as
opposed to individual sensors or actuators).
A. Our focus
This article presents a semantics-aware attack against a
widely used power grid network control functionality, and
demonstrates its practical feasibility on well-known Energy
Management System (EMS) softwares. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, we con-
duct a vulnerability assessment of an important functionality
provided by all EMSs ‚Äì the so-called Economic Dispatch (ED)
problem. In critical infrastructures, ED is routinely solved
to set the generator output levels over a control area of a
regional transmission grid. We show that software security
vulnerabilities in power system controllers can be exploited
by an attacker (an external hacker or a strategic market partic-
ipant) to gain a backdoor entry into power grid operations.2 By
utilizing the knowledge of an approximate power Ô¨Çow model
‚Äì speciÔ¨Åcally, DC approximation ‚Äì the attacker can launch
a semantic memory attack to change the critical parameters
such as transmission line ratings (capacities). A transmission
line‚Äôs rating reÔ¨Çects the maximum amount of power that it can
carry without violating safety codes or damaging the line. We
design experiments using ED implementation on real-world
EMS software packages to demonstrate the economic and
safety risks posed by use of manipulated line ratings.

tion software packages that solve economic dispatch problem.

The core of our attack generation approach against the
power grid infrastructure is a bilevel optimization problem
that encodes the attacker‚Äôs partial knowledge of power system
operations to compute the target malicious power system
parameters. This physics-aware attack generation approach
enables us to identify key features of power system data and
software operations whose exposure can signiÔ¨Åcantly increase
security risks. The implementation of our optimal attack
against power system operation involves targeted manipulation
of speciÔ¨Åc power system parameters that reside within the
EMS‚Äôs dynamic memory space. The exploit performs an online
memory data search using lightweight pattern matching to
locate the sensitive power system parameters used by the
ED software to calculate the generation output levels. The
use of manipulated parameter values makes the EMS issue
incorrect dispatch (generation and power Ô¨Çow) commands, and
consequently drive the power system towards unsafe states.
The merit of our overall approach lies in the combination of
the semantics-based optimal attack generation and a generic
implementation procedure for EMS‚Äôs memory data corruption.
The bilevel problem for attack generation can be viewed
as a sequential game between the attacker (leader) and the
follower (grid operator). In the Ô¨Årst stage, the attacker chooses
power system parameter manipulations with the objective of
maximizing the violation of capacity limits; in the second
stage, the operator solves the ED to determine generator output
levels while facing the manipulated parameters chosen by the
attacker in the Ô¨Årst stage. We show that the optimal power
injections and nodal voltages computed using the manipulated
parameters yield suboptimal and unsafe power Ô¨Çow alloca-
tions. This signiÔ¨Åcantly increases the possibility of cascading
failures and the risk of subsequent emergency actions.
Thus, the main contributions of our paper are as follows:
‚Äö We introduce a new domain-speciÔ¨Åc semantic data attack
against power grid controllers. The attack leverages an
approximate model of power system to manipulate the
controller runtime memory such that the execution of the
legitimate controller software, using partially corrupted
values, drives the physical plant towards unsafe states.
‚Äö We formulate the problem using a game-theoretic frame-
work to optimize the attack strategy in terms of which
available data regions in the controller memory space
should be modiÔ¨Åed. The adversary-optimal values are
calculated using fast bilevel optimization procedures.
‚Äö We implemented working prototypes of the proposed con-
troller attack against real-world large-scale and widely-
used energy management systems. Our implementations
leverage logical memory invariants to locate the sensitive
power system parameters in the controller‚Äôs memory
space. The evaluation results prove the feasibility of
domain-speciÔ¨Åc data corruption attacks to optimize for
the physical damage.
In the remaining of this section, we present an overview
of our proposed attack. Section II and Section III present
the attack model and optimization algorithm to calculate
the parameter manipulations that will maximize the ultimate
adversarial impact of resulting power Ô¨Çows. Section IV and

B. Solution Overview
Our contribution builds on two perspectives that have
evolved in the emerging Ô¨Åeld of cybersecurity of networked
control systems. The Ô¨Årst perspective involves the analysis
of state estimation and control algorithms under a class of
attacks to sensor measurements or actuator outputs [24]. These
attack models reÔ¨Çect the loss of availability (resp. integrity)
of measurements/outputs when the communication network
linking the physical system and remote devices is compro-
mised. Recent work has studied how the physical system‚Äôs
performance and stability can be compromised by such at-
tacks [17]. Typically the attacker is assumed to be a resource-
constrained adversary with only partial (or possibly full)
knowledge of system, and a resilient control design problem
is to ensure a reliable and safe performance against arbitrary
actions that can be performed by the attacker. These results
are grounded in the theory of robust and intrusion tolerant
control, which provides a quantitative framework to study
the tradeoffs between efÔ¨Åciency in nominal conditions and
robustness during non-nominal ones including the attacker-
induced failures. In contrast, as illustrated in Figure 1, our
attack model considers direct data corruption (speciÔ¨Åcally,
manipulation of power system critical parameters) in the
live memory of EMS software, where all distributed sensor
measurements are received and processed, i.e., single point
of compromise. Hence, individual infections of distributed
sensors are not required unlike previous work on false data
injection attacks [18]. This allows us to study how the vulner-
abilities in control software implementations and in their links
to external data sources can be exploited by the attackers.
A second perspective has emerged in the vulnerability
assessment of large-scale power grids against physical at-
tacks [6]. Here the objective is to Ô¨Ånd worst-case disturbance
or an adversary-optimal attack to physical components that
can maximize the impact on grid functionality, even under per-
fect observability and best response by the operator (defender).
Various classes of failures have been considered, for e.g., line
failures, sudden loss of generation, and load disconnects. Typ-
ically, these problems are formulated as bilevel optimization
problems, and involve explicit consideration of both physical

constraints (e.g., power Ô¨Çows, generation constraints, and line
capability limits) as well as resource constraints of the at-
tacker. Examples of physical security problems that have been
considered using this framework include N ¬¥ k contingency
analysis problem [7], network interdiction under line failures,
and modeling of cascading failures that originate due to
local component failures in one sub-network and progressively
propagate to other sub-networks of the grid. However, existing
work on adversary-optimal attack does not consider how such
an attack can be executed in controller software. In our work,
we combine the computation of adversary-optimal attack with
analysis of EMS software to execute the attack.
Threat model. Our adversary model
is concerned with
stealthy memory data corruption of EMS (that typically sits
within the control center); thus, we require a compromised
controller process within the EMS server. This is a realistic as-
sumption, because it requires lesser privileges compared to the
past real incidents such as Stuxnet [10] and BlackEnergy [5]
that took complete control of the servers. With the access to
EMS dynamic memory, the exploit targets the true memory-
resident power system critical parameters, and implements
calculated adversary-optimal incorrect values in EMS memory.
We emphasize two aspects of our model: Firstly, our at-
tack generation and implementation approach is generalizable.
However, to concretely illustrate our approach and to evaluate
its feasibility, we assume that the attacker is concerned with
generating ‚Äúoptimal‚Äù dynamic line ratings (DLRs) to max-
imize capacity violations. Indeed, other variations of attack
generation are possible, for e.g. manipulation of other parame-
ters such as generator/loads/voltage bounds, etc. Secondly, our
implementation approach is motivated by server-side attacks
to EMS software and emphasizes the stealthiness of the
attack. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, the in-memory parameter manipulations
are still within acceptable limits and hence pass the typical
out-of-bound checks for false data injections. Thus, they can
remain dormant
in controller‚Äôs memory and can produce
the intended consequences (e.g. thermal overloading, or even
physical damage) before the last line of defense (i.e., physical
fail-safe mechanisms) are triggered. Again, other ways of
implementing our attack are possible, for e.g. intercepting
network communication and injecting false data.
Implementations. We perform off-line binary analysis to
locate the power system parameters in the controller‚Äôs memory
space. We use this information to extract logic-based structural
pattern signatures (invariants) about the memory around power
system parameter value addresses. The signature predicates
are checked during attack-time to identify the real param-
eters on the victim controller memory space. Such pattern-
based search (as opposed to absolute memory address-based
search) is required because analysis-time (ofÔ¨Çine) and attack-
time (online) parameter value addresses in memory often
differ. This is because of unpredictable execution paths (due
to potentially different workloads) across different runs that
result in different heap memory allocation function call/return
sequences, and hence different allocated memory addresses.
Finally, the attack achieves a certain level of stealthiness by
ensuring that the incorrect parameters reÔ¨Çect similar general
trends as the true ones.
II. OPTIMAL ATTACKS TO ECONOMIC DISPATCH
In this section, we describe how the attacker generates a
semantic attack that utilizes the knowledge of an approximate
model of power Ô¨Çow to manipulate the model parameters used
by the ED software. We choose DC model as the approximate
model known by the attacker, and line capacities as the
targeted model parameters.
We show that under our adversary model, the allocation
generated by the ED implementation under the manipulated
capacity ratings, causes the power Ô¨Çows on the transmission
lines to exceed the actual line capacity ratings. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, its
implementation on the power system will lead to the violation
of safe thermal limits of the lines. This can cause the lines to
rapidly deteriorate or degrade, increasing their likelihood of
tripping. The sudden disconnection of power lines can cause
an outage. It may cause a short circuit between two lines
that can ignite a Ô¨Åre. Coming in contact with a line that is
live, can also kill people, seriously injure them. Thus, such a
semantic attack increases both reliability and safety risks in
power system operations to a signiÔ¨Åcant degree.
In our attack model, the attacker chooses the DLR ma-
nipulations in a way such that his actions are not obvious
to the System Operator (SO). If the effect of the attack is
not visible to the SO (for e.g., via line Ô¨Çow measurements
or emergency signals), the SO will not invoke generation
curtailment and/or line disconnect operations. In fact, under
partial network observability, the operator may not be able to
implement the necessary preventive actions in a timely manner.
As a result, the SO will implement the false ED solution that
will violate the line limits.
A. Attacker Knowledge
We Ô¨Årst describe the attacker‚Äôs system knowledge which
consists of DC-approximation of the actual nonlinear AC
power Ô¨Çow equations. The topology of a transmission network
can be described as a connected graph with the set of nodes
V and the set of edges E. In power systems terminology, each
node refers to a bus and each edge refers to a transmission
line. We let n ‚Äú |V|. Let ti, ju denote the line joining the
nodes i and j, and its susceptance (inverse of reactance) be
denoted as Œ≤ij. The set of generators at a bus i is denoted
as Gi. The set of all generators is denoted by G :‚Äú Gi. For
each i P G, pmin
are the lower and upper generation
bounds that are speciÔ¨Åc to the i¬¥th generator. The generation
bounds can be expressed as constraints on individual pi:
