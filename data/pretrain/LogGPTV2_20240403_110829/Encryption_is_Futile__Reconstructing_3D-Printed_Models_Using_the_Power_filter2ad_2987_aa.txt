ABSTRACT
Outsourced Additive Manufacturing (AM) exposes sensitive design
data to external malicious actors. Even with end-to-end encryption
between the design owner and 3D-printer, side-channel attacks can
be used to bypass cyber-security measures and obtain the underly-
ing design. In this paper, we develop a method based on the power
side-channel that enables accurate design reconstruction in the face
of full encryption measures without any prior knowledge of the
design. Our evaluation on a Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) 3D
Printer has shown 99 % accuracy in reconstruction, a significant
improvement on the state of the art. This approach demonstrates
the futility of pure cyber-security measures applied to Additive
Manufacturing.

1 INTRODUCTION
Additive Manufacturing (AM) has proven vulnerable to a variety of
attacks. Given that this is a high-growth and valuable industry [44],
cyber-security defenses are regularly considered, especially in the
private sector. However, in the case of outsourced manufacturing,
cross-domain (physical-to-cyber [47]) attacks can circumvent pure
cyber-security measures. In this paper, we develop such a side-
channel attack to steal the design data of a manufactured object.
Additive Manufacturing provides significant advantages over
traditional manufacturing methods. For instance, General Electric1
has claimed it provides production flexibility, reduced weight, com-
plex geometries, and graded materials [15]. Smaller manufacturers
can also benefit, but are often prohibited by the high capital expen-
diture and specialized operational knowledge. Outsourcing busi-
ness models have flourished to address this need; world leaders in-
clude ThyssenKrupp AG TechCenter Additive Manufacturing (Ger-
many) [41], Akhani3D (South Africa) [3], RapidDirect (China) [32],
and Treatstock (United States) [42]. While the above manufactur-
ers are reputable, not all manufacturers will be trustworthy or safe
from insider threats. A malicious AM service provider is in a unique
position to steal technical data.
To address this threat, systems have been proposed offering
Digital Rights Management (DRM) and adapting traditional cyber-
security for AM environments. In a recent patent, Oligshclaeger et
al. [30] propose to use cryptographic keys unique to a 3D printer for
end-to-end encryption of designs. In a similar proposal by GE [19],
technical data is decrypted by a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) (a
dedicated security chip) integrated in the 3D printer, limiting access
to plaintext (i.e., decrypted) data and cryptographic keys. Several
companies, such as Identify3D [24], offer commercial options that
implement DRM and encryption.
Identify3D in particular is addressing the distributed and out-
sourced manufacturing market: their technology suite is claimed to
provide “intellectual property protection, manufacturing repeata-
bility, and traceability” to “unlock the potential of distributed man-
ufacturing” [25]. Taken together, we believe these individual de-
velopments constitute a trend towards securing outsourced manu-
facturing via DRM, which will further boost the already growing

sector. We wish to examine a case where this technology is not only
available, but has achieved its apogee; we assume the cyber-security
implementation is comprehensive and faultless. Even in this case,
we seek demonstrate that pure cyber-security measures are not
sufficient to protect IP against a malicious contract manufacturer.
A number of publications have explored offensive or defensive
reconstructions of AM IP using side-channels [11, 17, 22, 37]. The
side-channels utilized in these works include the acoustic, electro-
magnetic (EM), visual, and inertial readings; these data streams
have been used individually and in combination, through recon-
structive approaches based on data mining, machine learning with
or without human assistance, and control theory. We develop a
novel approach to reconstruction utilizing a side-channel not yet
used for this purpose, the actuator current draw. This side channel
has numerous advantages compared to those previously explored:
the potential for perfect or near-perfect reconstruction, excellent
portability to all classes of actuators, and a level of stealth that
allows for multiple viable threat models.
Threat Model: In this paper, we assume a Man-at-the-End
(MATE) threat model applied to outsourced AM. Comprehensive
digital security measures are assumed to be in place to protect the
customer’s data, such as end-to-end encryption of the model and a
TPM module on the 3D printer (see Figure 1). We assume that either
the service provider itself is malicious, or has a malicious insider
employee with some access to the AM equipment. The intent of
the malicious party is to reconstruct the customer’s 3D printed
model. We assume that they are unable to compromise the cyber-
security measures, but are able to instrument the 3D printer at will.
Potential implementations of the sensor suite are stealthy enough
that a single insider could instrument a 3D printer and capture the
side-channel data. This permits the attack against any printer an
insider has even temporary physical access to. Under this threat
model, we develop an approach to capture and reconstruct the 3D
printed model that bypasses cyber-security measures entirely.
Overall, we contribute a significant evolution of the state of the
art in reconstruction, a novel approach to collecting and interpret-
ing AM actuator signals, and a demonstration of MATE attacks in
AM circumventing defensive systems.
This paper is structured as follows: Section 2 reviews the litera-
ture. Section 3 outlines our approach and the challenges involved.
The approach is presented in pseudocode in Section 4. Section 5
explains our experimental evaluation and presents our results. We
discuss the limitations of the approach in Section 6, and further
topics in Section 7. Section 8 concludes the paper.
2 STATE OF THE ART
Multiple authors have surveyed the field of AM security [27, 31, 48].
The theft of technical data emerged as a topic early in the field’s
development. It was mentioned in 2014 by Yampolskiy et al. [45,
46], with practical attacks published in 2016 by Do et al. [14] and
Belikovetsky et al. [9] using cyber means to access design files.
The majority of AM sabotage attacks, such as Sturm et al. [40],
Belikovetsky et al. [9], and Zeltmann et al. [50], acquire and modify
the design files, implying a data theft attack as a prerequisite [20].
A variety of cyber-security solutions have been proposed to re-
spond to the threat of data theft in AM. Adkins et al.’s patent [2] for
an approach to securely delivering design files describes a system
applying encryption on a trusted device, and practices for main-
taining trust through the print process. Safford et al. [35] propose
a similar system with hardware based on TPM technology. Such
systems, robust as they might be to cyber attacks, can often be
circumvented with side-channel attacks.
Side-channels are a common vulnerability of embedded systems.
They are the physical emanations of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS),
such as electromagnetics or sound, which can be correlated to the
original processes. Classical approaches include Van Eck’s remote
spying on Cathode Ray Tube displays by their emanations [43], and
Koscher’s Simple and Differential Power Analysis for identifying
encryption algorithms and cryptographic keys [26].
The first practical side-channel exploitation in AM was con-
ducted by Al Faruque et al. [4] using acoustic emanations from
the motors of a Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) 3D Printer. The
authors identified that motor noise could be correlated with oper-
ating speed, direction, and the axis of movement. Using a machine-
learning approach, they reconstructed motor movements for the
printing of a basic polygon. They achieved 78.35 % accuracy of
axis prediction, on average, and had a 17.82 % error in movement
distance estimation.
Shortly afterwards, Hojjati et al. [22] and Song et al. [37] pre-
sented machine-learning-based reconstructions using the acoustic
side-channel, relying on smartphone audio sensors. Hojjati et al.
used a library of recorded printhead motions in addition to magnetic

side-channel info and a human-managed error correction process.
They report accuracy in terms of end gap lengths for segments
(ranging 0.5-4.2mm) and angle deviations (ranging 0-3 degrees).
Song et al. report an average Mean Tendency Error of 5.87 % in a
similar model to that of Al-Faruque et al. [4], but raise concern over
whether their metrics were meaningful. Both papers test only on
perimeters with no infill.
Gao et al. [17] made significant strides in reconstruction accu-
racy and metrics in their 2018 work on process monitoring. Using a
multi-sensor suite of accelerometer, magnetometer, and camera, the
authors reconstruct the physical properties of toolpath, extrusion
speed, layer thickness, and fan speed. Each of the physical prop-
erties required its own reconstruction approach, and the authors
deploy different metrics based on their own judgement of appropri-
ateness. The most noteworthy is the use of the Hausdorff Distance,
a distance measure that reports the deviation between two sampled
curves, which the authors applied on a per-layer basis. For their
Kalmann-filter-based reconstruction of the toolpath, the authors
achieved error ranging from 0.735 mm to 0.869 mm. The experi-
ment was conducted on full printed models, with infill percentages
ranging from 5 to 20 %; lower infill percentages corresponded to
lower Hausdorff Distances.
In addition and in response to published side-channel attacks,
some authors have proposed methods either to defend AM systems
with side-channel techniques, or else to defend against them. A
number of side-channel papers in the field utilize them to detect
sabotage attacks or print errors [6–8, 11, 18, 39], using much the
same approach as a data-theft attack. Recently, a collaboration of
Yu, Chhetri, and Al-Faruque [49] made significant improvements
to attack detection accuracy employing a multi-modal approach,
examining many identified side-channels at once and correlating
their information. Work by Chhetri et al. discusses modifications to
toolpath generation either to increase [10, 33] or decrease [12, 33]
the side-channel information that could be used in reconstruction.
Al-Faruque et al. acquired a 2019 patent [5] on defending side-
channel attacks with their mutual information reduction strategy,
implemented in the toolpath-generation stages of the AM process.
Gatlin et al. [18] utilized the power side-channel for detecting sab-
otage attacks, but did not attempt reconstruction, instead using a
Principal Component Analysis–based signature.
3 CHALLENGES OF RECONSTRUCTION
In this work, we focus on 3D printers employing the FDM process,
which is widely used in both desktop and high-end polymer 3D
printers. The process is based on the extrusion of heated polymer
filament through a nozzle, built into a print head which can be
moved along the X-, Y-, and Z-axes, and extrude or retract filament
along the E-axis. Both printhead movement and filament extrusion
are driven by motors, controlled by an on-board motor controller.
The bipolar hybrid stepper motor is a commonly used positional
actuator in FDM printers; our test printer, the Lulzbot Taz 6 (See
Figure 2), uses these motors exclusively. Each motor has two phases
and each phase is connected by two wires, forming an electrical
loop delivering current from the controller. The current is delivered
in a sinusoidal pattern, making it Alternating Current (AC). Both
