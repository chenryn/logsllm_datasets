Question: "Why is it that CTR mode encryption and decryption can be parallelized while CBC mode encryption cannot? Select the reasons that apply."
 "A": "CTR mode uses a nonce and counter for each block cipher operation, which do not depend on previous or subsequent blocks."
 "B": "CBC mode requires the previous ciphertext block to encrypt the current plaintext block, creating a sequential dependency."
 "C": "CTR mode requires sequential processing of blocks to ensure the integrity of the nonce and counter."
 "D": "CBC mode decryption is also not parallelizable because it depends on the plaintext of the previous block."
Answer: AB
