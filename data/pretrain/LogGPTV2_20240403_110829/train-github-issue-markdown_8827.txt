Can we possible add a feature to the Index command that gives the option of
returning the source of the existing item on failure to update/insert. The
failure would probably be caused by a version conflict. I have scenarios were
multiple (external) nodes need to update the same key with different values
and possibly the same value. If I get the source back it would remove the need
for me to have to query for it on failure to figure out what state I am in.
