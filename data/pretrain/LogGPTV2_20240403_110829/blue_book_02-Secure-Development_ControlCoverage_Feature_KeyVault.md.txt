### Key Vault Security Controls and Rationale

| **Control** | **Description & Rationale** | **Severity** | **Automated Fix Script** | **Manual Fix Required** |
|-------------|-----------------------------|--------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Certificate Authentication for AAD Apps** | Azure Active Directory (AAD) applications that have access to Key Vault must use certificates for authentication. Passwords or shared secrets can be easily compromised, whereas certificate-based authentication provides enhanced security. | High | Yes | No |
| **Key Vault Sharing** | Applications should not share a Key Vault unless they trust each other and require access to the same secrets at runtime. Key Vaults contain critical information such as credentials and secrets. Allowing all applications to access all secrets in a Key Vault can violate trust boundaries. | High | Yes | No |
| **RBAC for Minimum Permissions** | All users and identities must be granted the minimum required permissions using Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). This ensures that users and services have just enough access to perform their tasks, minimizing the risk of resource exposure in case of a compromise. | High | Yes | No |
| **Minimum Required Key Vault Access Policies** | Key Vault access policies must be defined with the minimum required permissions for keys and secrets. This minimizes the exposure of resources in the event of a user or service account compromise. | High | Yes | No |
| **Advanced Access Policies** | Advanced access policies, which allow seamless access from Azure services like Azure Resource Manager, Virtual Machines, and Disk Encryption, must be configured on a need basis. This prevents unintentional access to Key Vault from Azure services. | Medium | Yes | No |
| **HSM-Protected Keys** | All keys in Key Vault must be protected by a Hardware Security Module (HSM). HSMs ensure that keys never leave the HSM boundary throughout their lifecycle, providing an additional layer of security for highly sensitive data, especially in regulated environments. | Medium | Yes | No |
| **Expiration Dates for Keys and Secrets** | All keys and secrets in Key Vault must have expiration dates to ensure periodic key rotation. Key rotation is an important security practice to maintain the integrity and confidentiality of sensitive data. | Medium | Yes | No |
| **Diagnostics Logs Retention** | Diagnostics logs must be enabled with a retention period of at least 365 days. Long-term log retention is essential for compliance and for recreating activity trails during incident investigations. | Medium | Yes | No |
| **Restricted Cryptographic Operations** | The cryptographic operations permitted using keys must be restricted to only those actually required. This ensures that applications and users can only perform intended operations, minimizing the risk of key exposure in case of a compromise. | High | Yes | No |
| **Role-Based Access for Key Vault** | The Key Vault owner must grant the minimum required access to keys and secrets based on individual roles (e.g., Developer, Operator, Auditor, Security Team). Proper role assignment ensures separation of duties and enhances security. | High | No | Yes |
| **Periodic Key and Secret Rotation** | Keys and secrets must be rotated periodically. Regular rotation is a good security practice that reduces the likelihood of data loss or compromise due to key theft, brute forcing, or recovery attacks. | Medium | No | Yes |
| **Periodic Log Reviews** | Diagnostic, activity, and audit logs for Key Vault must be reviewed periodically. Regular reviews help in early detection of anomalous activity, preventing major security incidents. | Medium | No | Yes |
| **Soft Delete for Key Vault** | Soft delete must be enabled to allow recovery of deleted Key Vaults and any objects (keys, secrets, etc.) contained within them. This feature acts as a safety measure against inadvertent or malicious deletion. | Medium | Yes | No |

This table outlines the key security controls for Azure Key Vault, along with their rationale, severity, and whether an automated fix script is available or if manual intervention is required.
