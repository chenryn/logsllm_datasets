"C": "Advantage: A whitelist approach rarely needs updating. Disadvantage: A blacklist can offer more fine-grained control over user input.",
"D": "Advantage: Blacklisting can adapt quickly to new threats. Disadvantage: Whitelisting provides no security benefit as it cannot anticipate unknown threats."
