User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Can someone using (the Join Me) screen sharing software use it to access my PC's files? When using Join Me, can a file on a desktop be stolen by those viewing?  I was using Join Me and another person was communicating with me to set up log in and access to My Vault, when I noticed a folder went missing from my desktop for about 15 minutes and then reappeared in a different location then where I put it.  Was that person taking my personal file folder information?

Assistant: While we frequently say that people "steal" your files, we really mean that they copy them. So, if the remote desktop user wanted to just get your data, they wouldn't have copied then deleted your files, they just would have copied them. 

Furthermore, join.me does not allow for simple copy-and-paste file copying. Copying files is an interactive process that requires you to initiate the process.

What I suspect happened is that you or the remote desktop user accidentally dragged your folder across the desktop. This happens frequently in Windows. When you noticed that the folder wasn't where it was, you thought it disappeared. Later you found where it was on your desktop (this place may have been covered by a window making it impossible to see) and thought it had reappeared. The same thing has happened to me many times.

So, unless the remote user knows of some still unpublished, critical vulnerability in join.me, I think you're just fine.
