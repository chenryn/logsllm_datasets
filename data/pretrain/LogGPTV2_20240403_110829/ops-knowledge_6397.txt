User: I cannot get jupyter running from my Command line using:
jupyter notebook

jupyter is not recognised as an internal or external command, operable
  program or batch file'

But I can get it running from pycharm (slick but with issues). When I take the kernel's IP and Port from pycharm and paste it into my browser I can get it running from there. 
I cannot use anaconda because of Arcpy, and I have dug around the jupyter files for some hints.
I'm assuming I need to add something to my path?
Assistant: Try to open it using the Anaconda Prompt. Just type jupyter notebook and press Enter.
Anaconda Prompt has existed for a long time and is the correct way of using Anaconda. May be you have a broken installation somehow.
Try this, if the above doesn't work-

In the Command Prompt type,
pip3 install jupyter if you're using Python3
Else, if you are using Python2.7 then type pip install jupyter.

...Some installation should happen...

Now retry typing jupyter notebook in the CMD, it should work now.
