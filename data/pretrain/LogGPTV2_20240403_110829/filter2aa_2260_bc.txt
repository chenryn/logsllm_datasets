The area is proficient at regularly using console patches to connect multiple agencies across different 
systems, including an ultra high frequency (UHF) system.  The use of these console patches and the UHF 
shared system were proficiently demonstrated during the TICP validation exercise.  It was noted in the 
exercise that all jurisdictions were familiar with the shared system’s use and operation.  It should be noted 
that Morgantown does not have any radio caches or mutual aid channels available.  The area had a successful 
exercise, but did not integrate all state, federal, and selected local agencies (e.g., Monongalia Fire Service), 
which could present interoperability challenges.   
Recommendations: 
• 
Involve local, state, and federal agencies (e.g., Monongalia fire service, National Guard) in training and 
exercises 
• 
Consider adding communications interoperability as component of all future exercises

The agencies within the Tri-County area operate on multiple conventional, very high frequency and UHF radio systems.  
Interoperability is achieved through console patches as well as the WVIRP, a P25 standards-compliant, digital, trunked, 
UHF radio system.  The consoles have the ability to patch channels/talk groups from all systems and all counties in the 
Tri-County area.  These consoles are located in three dispatch centers that are staffed around the clock. 
The Tri-County area will continue to use console patches and the WVIRP radio system.  The WVIRP is expected to be 
implemented statewide in the future.

The State of Wyoming has designated Laramie County, the City of Cheyenne, and public safety agencies 
serving state government in the Capitol Complex as its metropolitan area (area).   
Governance: Advanced Implementation 
The Wyoming Public Safety Communications Commission (PSCC) has successfully established 
communications interoperability as a public safety priority in the area.  The PSCC was created and 
formalized in 2004 by state statute and is the primary communications committee in the area.  The PSCC 
consists of five working groups with significant local, state, and federal participation—Administration and 
Funding, WyoLink Operations, Spectrum, Inter-operability Executive Committee, and the State Agency Law 
Enforcement Communications Committee (SALECS).  The Wyoming PSCC is in the process of developing 
and publishing active agreements (e.g., WyoLink Handbook and Membership Agreement), but currently is 
operating with informal and undocumented agreements.  Laramie County has a strategic plan in place that 
specifically supports the use of a shared, statewide system (WyoLink) that allows interoperable 
communications among the agencies in the area. The area has a long-term funding plan in place to build, 
maintain, and operate the WyoLink system through the use of state and federal funding.  The governor has 
been active in prioritizing interoperability for public safety agencies in both the state and in Laramie County 
with proven political and fiscal support.   
Recommendations:  
• 
Document and formalize the necessary agreements (e.g., memoranda of understanding), including local, 
state, federal, and tribal partnerships to achieve regional interoperability 
Standard Operating Procedures (SOP): Advanced Implementation 
The area demonstrated successful consolidation of separate jurisdictional SOPs (City of Cheyenne and 
Laramie County’s recently consolidated communications center and SOPs) into the Tactical Interoperable 
Communications Plan (TICP). These regional SOPs for interoperability have been distributed to all 
organizations, and Laramie County plans to participate in additional TICP and Communications Unit Leader 
training. The area has indicated that as the WyoLink system becomes fully operational across the state, 
updated SOPs will be included in the TICP and disseminated.  Laramie County began implementing the 
National Incident Management System (NIMS)/Incident Command Structure (ICS) more than one year ago, 
and all public safety agencies in the area use these procedures.  Overall, command and control was 
performed successfully during the TICP validation exercise; however, because of the limited scope of the 
exercise, assessing the use of regional SOPs and command and control in a multijurisdictional environment 
was limited.  Laramie County indicated that the TICP would be expanded to include surrounding 
jurisdictions in the future. 
Recommendations: 
• 
Update and disseminate the TICP once the WyoLink system is implemented

Laramie County frequently uses gateway console patches in day-to-day operations and uses shared channels 
daily.  The area fully demonstrated interoperable communications capabilities (e.g., through shared channels 
and gateways), including state and federal agencies, although the TICP validation exercise was limited in 
scope to agencies in Laramie County.  In the future, multijurisdictional exercises should test the use of the 
new WyoLink system within the area.   
Recommendations: 
• 
Conduct more robust exercises to test interoperable communications capabilities (e.g., additional 
participants, additional local, state, federal, and tribal agencies) 
• 
Consider adding communications interoperability as a component of all future exercises

Public safety communications in the State of Wyoming currently take place on multiple standalone very high frequency 
(VHF) radio systems.  The state is currently replacing these outdated systems with a statewide VHF high band digital 
trunked system designed to meet the Project 25 standards.  The installation is scheduled in phases, with the first phase 
providing coverage for Laramie County.  This first phase of the installation is expected to be complete by the end of 
2006, and the entire system is planned to be completed by late 2007.

American Samoa designated the entire Territory of American Samoa as its metropolitan area (area).  The 
area consists of five rugged, highly eroded (and extinct) volcanic islands and two coral atolls.  The American 
Samoa islands are Tutuila, Aunu’u, Ofu, Olosega, Ta’u, Swains, and Rose Islands.  (Swains and Rose Islands 
are not covered under the systems discussed in this summary.)

The Territorial Emergency Communications Committee (TECC) was established in 2005 and reports to the 
Office of the Governor.  TECC oversaw the creation of the Tactical Interoperable Communications Plan 
(TICP); this formal committee includes local agencies, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration, and the Federal Aviation Administration.  This mix of local and federal participation 
represents a positive step in achieving multijurisdictional communications interoperability plans.  Beyond the 
operational focus of the TICP, the area does not have any formal interoperable communications agreements 
and has a mix of formal and informal partnerships among the public safety organizations in the area.  
American Samoa does not have a strategic plan for regional interoperable communications, but has recently 
initiated planning efforts.  This strategy, as it develops, can also support the prioritization of goals so that 
funding can be planned accordingly.  Currently, jurisdictions develop budgets within their jurisdiction 
through federal grant money allocations and have no other sustainable funding sources.  Interoperable 
communications planning began in 2005 for American Samoa, but since that time no additional federal grant 
monies have been allocated to the area for future investments and lifecycle costs.  With a recent push for 
more interoperability support and the governor’s direct involvement, leadership in American Samoa provides 
political support for regional interoperability. 
Recommendations: 
• 
Clarify federal membership in the decision-making group (e.g., TECC), and document roles and 
responsibilities  
• 
Develop, document, and formalize agreements (e.g., signed memoranda of understanding [MOU] with 
defined roles and responsibilities) among all participating agencies relating to regional interoperability 
• 
Reference all applicable agreements (e.g., MOUs, intergovernmental agreements) in the TICP and store 
them in an accessible format and establish a regular review process so they remain relevant 
• 
Develop, document, and implement a regional strategic plan (beyond the operational TICP) with 
participant approval, adoption, and acceptance, that takes into account a long-term communications 
funding strategy (beyond grants) 
• 
Align regional and territorywide strategic planning efforts to ensure that regional needs are met 
• 
List near-term territorywide interoperability funding priorities and identify a funding plan 
• 
Develop and implement a territorywide approach to long-term (e.g. 3 to 5 years) sustainable funding that 
is consistent with the strategic plan 
• 
Continue to champion a governance structure that will support regional communications interoperability, 
and involve senior regional government leadership in long-term funding plans

The SOPs in the American Samoa TICP represent the area’s first regional plan for interoperable 
communications.  Despite having the TICP adopted by all participating agencies, no steps have been taken to 
disseminate it to ensure its incorporation in operations (e.g., distribution to all included agencies and dispatch 
centers).  During the exercise, participants did not demonstrate proficiency in executing the TICP policies 
and procedures (e.g., problems activating gateways).  The area has not yet begun to implement the National 
Incident Management System (NIMS)/Incident Command System (ICS), and participants were unable to 
demonstrate proficiency during the exercise (e.g., unified command was not established, Communications 
Unit Leader was designated but not announced).   
Recommendations: 
• 
Develop regional interoperability SOPs (beyond the TICP) with acceptance by first responder agencies 
• 
Distribute and put SOPs into practice throughout the territory through regular training, exercises, and 
usage  
• 
Develop training policies and requirements for inclusion in the TICP to ensure broad understanding of 
the SOPs 
• 
Initiate basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs (include communications unit 
implementation consistent with the TICP) to ensure that all participating first responder agencies attain

American Samoa does not frequently encounter situations that require communications interoperability 
solutions; however, its shared system is used for day-to-day operations.  TICP validation exercise 
participants communicated primarily through face-to-face communications rather than through interoperable 
communications equipment, but were able demonstrate some familiarity with gateways (e.g., fixed gateway 
patched successfully) when required.  The limited scope of the exercise did not provide an opportunity for 
participants to fully stress their interoperable communications capabilities.  As such, the participants were 
asked to test the use of their available interoperability assets and did not demonstrate proficiency in their use 
(e.g., incident command experienced problems operating the cache radio).  Additionally, because the 
exercise was conducted in a mix of English and Samoan, and some documentation is in Samoan, outside 
responders may encounter a language barrier during a mutual aid response. 
Recommendations: 
• 
Regularly test and exercise deployment of and procedures for territory’s interoperability resources (e.g., 
gateways) to improve proficiency and familiarity of use 
• 
Consider adding interoperable communications as an evaluation component for all future exercises and 
day-to-day activities

The territory’s public safety personnel use an ultra high frequency (UHF) radio system, with one channel for fire and 
police.  More channels have recently been found, and the Territorial Office of Homeland Security will work with 
Department of Public Safety to use them.  The Emergency Medical Services uses its own UHF radio system.  Airport 
Rescue and Fire Fighting is on an aviation band very high frequency radio system.  All radio systems have severe 
coverage and maintenance issues.  The area would like to move toward a Project 25 compliant radio system for all 
agencies on the islands and would also like to obtain communications links to nearby islands for purposes of marine 
interdiction and mutual aid.  A lack of funding is the main issue preventing interoperability progress.

The Interoperable Communications Working Group (ICWG) group, which created the Tactical Interoperable 
Communications Plan (TICP), includes all public safety organizations in the area, and reports directly to the 
Homeland Security Advisor and the Governor.  Guam operates through one level of government and has 
formalized agreements within the government; the area is developing additional memoranda of 
understanding with the Department of Defense (DoD), U.S. Coast Guard, and the National Guard.  Although 
Guam has encountered problems in formalizing an agreement, its efforts to work with DoD to establish such 
an agreement are commendable.  Guam does not currently have a strategic plan for regional interoperable 
communications, but appears to be developing regional strategic goals.  The Guam Police Department 
provides for the maintenance costs associated with the area’s shared system backbone, but the area does not 
have a long-term funding strategy for additional lifecycle costs specific to interoperability needs.  The 
Governor and other regional leadership have clearly made regional interoperability a political priority.  
Recommendations: 
• 
Continue to involve area and federal organizations in the decision-making group (e.g., ICWG), and 
document roles and responsibilities as part of group 
• 
Establish a regular review process to ensure that agreements remain current and relevant 
• 
Develop, document, and implement a regional strategic plan (beyond the operational TICP) with

The SOPs included in the Guam TICP represent the area’s first regional plan for interoperable 
communications, but the area has taken some steps to disseminate the TICP (e.g., TICP Implementation 
Workshop to train area agencies).  During the exercise, participants did not demonstrate familiarity with the 
TICP policies and procedures (e.g., shared talk groups documented in TICP are not programmed into radios). 
While no training procedures currently exist, there are plans to establish these procedures.  National Incident 
Management System (NIMS)/Incident Command System (ICS) has not yet been implemented in Guam, but 
the area is working to establish compliance among the public safety organizations.

Guam uses interoperable communications solutions almost exclusively for mutual aid response efforts.  
During the TICP validation exercise, participants were able to demonstrate familiarity with console patching; 
however, they generally were unable to establish interoperable communications among all participating 
agencies (e.g., Guam Civil Defense Agency, public health, power department).  The shared talk groups noted 
in the TICP were not programmed into the portable radios, and no shared channels were available.  However, 
participants were able to demonstrate proficiency in using the area’s shared system (used in day-to-day 
events). 
Recommendations: 
• 
Regularly test and exercise the deployment of and procedures for the area’s communications 
interoperability resources (e.g., gateway) to improve proficiency 
• 
Consider adding interoperable communications as an evaluation component for all future exercises and

GovGuam agencies and their federal partners is achieved through console patching. 
The SmartNet system is very old, and Motorola no longer makes parts for it.  Guam is beginning the process of looking 
into purchasing a new 700 or 800 MHz trunked radio system.
