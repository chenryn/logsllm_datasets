User: According to the documentation from python.org, python 3.2 install on mac os requires an upgrade to tcl/tk 8.5.9 (for use of IDLE). In my haste, I have done both. Now my friend told me that python 3 is not recommended yet because only the built-ins and a few modules have been released for 3. The stable one so far is 2.7 (especially if one wants to make extensive use of a variety of modules). My machine has both 2.6.1 and 3.2 (because some OS services make use of 2.6.1 that comes as default with the OS).
1. How do i remove 3.2 completely to avoid any compatibility issues?
tcl/tk 8.5.9 was also installed and this is not the default. There was no verbose mode during installation, so I don't know whether it replaced the default one. If it did how bad can it be for the OS? and hence
2. If the above is really bad, how do i downgrade to the old version of tcl/tk?
In short, how do i bring my machine back to its original state? If anyone knows all the paths to the directories and files I can do it manually.
Thanks
Assistant: just uninstall 3x version of python if you have already installed it. Eclipse  has that option when you click "see whats already installed". 
Install later 2.7 version. It works for me on my OS X 10.9.2 with Eclipse Juno.
