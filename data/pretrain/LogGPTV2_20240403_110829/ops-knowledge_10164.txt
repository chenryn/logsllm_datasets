I have been using Enthought Python Distribution (EPD) for some time and recently started using Canopy. Now, I have both EPD and Canopy installed on my Windows 7 Pro x64 system. However, I've encountered an issue: I am unable to launch Canopy's IPython interactive session from a Windows command prompt, even though the directory `C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Enthought\Canopy\User\Scripts` has been added to my system's PATH environment variable, and it is listed before the EPD's Python directory.

Upon investigating the files in the `.../Canopy/User/Scripts/` directory, I suspect that the problem lies with the `ipython.exe` file, rather than the `ipython-script.py` file. When I type `ipython` in a Windows command shell, it should run `ipython.exe`, but this does not start the IPython session as expected.

Interestingly, if I navigate to the `.../Canopy/User/Scripts/` directory and execute `python ipython-script.py` from the command prompt, the IPython session starts correctly. This suggests that `ipython.exe` is not properly invoking `ipython-script.py`.

Has anyone else experienced this issue? Is there a straightforward solution?

**Additional Information:**
- I have the latest version of Canopy (1.0.1.1160) installed.
- I am looking for a way to resolve this so that I can simply type `ipython` in the command prompt and have it work as expected.

**Note:** If you are trying to launch the web-based interactive environment, you can use the command `ipython notebook` in either the Windows command shell or the Canopy shell, and it should work.

Thank you for any assistance.
