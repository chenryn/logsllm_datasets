User: I have been using EPD for some time and recently started using Canopy. So now I have both EPD and Canopy installed on my machine, which runs Windows 7 Pro x64. But I just realized I cannot launch Canopy's IPython interactive session (located in the directory C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Enthought\Canopy\User\Scripts) in a Windows command prompt. I already added this directory to my Path before the EPD's python directory.
I checked out those files in the directory .../Canopy/User/Scripts/, I believe that problem is not with the file "ipython-script.py" there, but with the file "ipython.exe", which is what will be run when I simply type "ipython" in a Windows command shell (I set the path already).
In a Windows command shell, if I changed to the directory .../Canopy/User/Scripts/ and type up "python ipython-script.py", then I can correctly start the IPython session in the command shell. So, it looks like that "ipython.exe" does not run the script "ipython-script.py"...
Has anyone run into this same problem? Is there an easy fix?
P.S. I already had the latest Canopy (version 1.0.1.1160) installed.
Thanks for any help.
Assistant: If you want to launch web interactive then the command
ipython notebook  in windows shell or in canopy shell works.
