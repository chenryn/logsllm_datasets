frequency band (1925MHz-1995MHz), but uses a sweep interval
of 0.65s. Out of 300 channels we measured, 91 were partially used
and thus considered in our analysis.
The Need for Fine Grained Measurements.
Figure 15 com-
pares the distribution of the spectrum availability and channel idle
time on each of the 91 channels. We segment traces into one-hour
segments. To examine the impact of sweep time, we compare the
results by using 0.65, 1.3 and 1.95 seconds sweep time. The mea-
surement results of the latter two were obtained by downsampling
the original measurement traces. We see that while their average
availabilities appear similar, the measurement results using differ-
ent sweep times display different idle duration distributions. This
means that the variations in channel availability continue at ﬁner
time scales, and secondary devices cannot simply improve perfor-
mance by working at ﬁner time scales.
Artifacts of Using Coarse Granularity.
The above results show
that the current measurement granularity (1.8 seconds and even
0.65 seconds) is unable to capture variations in primary user spec-
trum access. With this in mind, we wish to understand the potential
artifacts when secondary devices use coarse access granularity than
that of channel availability variations.
We use the measured traces (with slot size of τ ) to approximate
true primary user access patterns. To implement coarse access
granularity, we consider opportunistic access with slot size of kτ
by subsampling the traces by a factor of k. This means that sec-
ondary users sense the channel at the start of each kτ interval, and
make access decision for the entire kτ interval. For a fair com-
parison, we evaluate all the access systems using the same primary
user access patterns and the same, exact statistical knowledge on
primary user access patterns.
We examine the artifacts of using k=2 and 3 (1.3s and 1.95s ac-
cess slots) and the SKA scheme. Figure 16(a)-(b) show the cumu-
lative distribution of the normalized change in extraction rate and
the actual primary user disruption rate, across all channel segments.
Using coarser access granularity leads to both overly conservative
and aggressive access decisions – the normalized change of extrac-
tion rate is between 0.6 and 1.4. These suboptimal decisions lead
to 0–0.4 primary user disruptions. On 45+% of channel segments,
they violate the primary user disruption limit (0.1). This shows that
only if secondary user’s access granularity is no coarser than that
of variations in primary user access patterns, can SKA deﬁned in
(1) fully satisfy the primary user disruption limit. When using a
coarser access granularity, secondary users must modify their SKA
scheme in order to avoid disrupting primary users.
These improper access decisions occur because secondary users
must round the optimal ﬁne-grained access decision by the coarser
time granularity, either stop transmission too earlier or too late. In-
tuitively, the impact of such rounding effect is most severe when
primary user access patterns display small idle durations. This is
further conﬁrmed by the results in Figure 16(c), which plot the nor-
malized difference in extraction rate vs. the average primary user
idle duration.

Spectrum Measurements.
Several measurement campaigns
have studied spectrum occupancy across the globe [1, 5, 7, 13, 23,
24]. All of them have discovered signiﬁcant opportunities for op-
portunistic spectrum access. An extensive measurement on 30MHz-
3GHz frequency bands at six US locations [1] identiﬁed a maxi-

mum 13% spectrum occupancy. Measurements on 2006 Football
World Cup at two Germany locations shows signiﬁcant variations
in spectrum usage before, during and after the match. Signiﬁcant
variance was also found on cellular network’s spectrum usage, us-
ing call logs over three weeks [24]. Recent measurement study at
four Chinese locations detects strong dependency across frequency
channels and applies a pattern matching algorithm to predict chan-
nel state from past observations [7]. Finally, the Mobnets group
from RWTH performed extensive measurements at three European
locations [23].
Our work differs from existing works by examining the actual
spectrum accessible to secondary users without violating the pri-
mary user disruption limit. Even with accurate knowledge of pri-
mary user access statistics, we show that the accessible spectrum is
signiﬁcantly less than the available spectrum. We then propose and
evaluate frequency bundling that builds high-quality transmissions
out of many scattered spectrum fragments. Different from [7], our
analysis shows that channels are mostly independent in their spec-
trum occupancy patterns. These differences might be attributed to
two factors: 1) differences in usage at different measurement sites
and 2) inclusion of completely busy and idle channels in [7] during
correlation calculation.
Opportunistic Spectrum Access.
Research efforts in this area
have developed both analytical access strategies and models [14,
21, 19, 28] as well as practical algorithms and systems [4, 9, 22].
They have motivated us to consider practical opportunistic access
systems and to quantify the actual accessible spectrum. While most
of these works either assume analytical models on primary user ac-
cess patterns or focus on realizing sensing and accessing in real sys-
tems, our work offers a complementary study that uses real world
measurement traces to understand the feasibility and effectiveness
of opportunistic spectrum access.
8. CONCLUSION
Little is known about how well secondary devices in dynamic
spectrum networks can make use of the partially utilized channels
occupied by primary users. We present in this paper the ﬁrst com-
prehensive study on the level of “usable” spectrum available to sec-
ondary devices while respecting hard limits on disruptions to pri-
mary users. Our analysis of extensive ﬁne-grain spectrum usage
traces shows that even with extensive statistical knowledge on pri-
mary user access patterns, and while running optimal algorithms,
secondary devices can only extract 20–30% of available spectrum
in a channel. While this means current access schemes cannot pro-
vide usable channels to support traditional applications, we can re-
gain reasonable levels of reliability by bundling multiple unreli-
163able channels together. Our analysis shows very little to no cor-
relation in spectrum usage patterns across channels, which leads
us to choose a simple random frequency bundling scheme. We
also show that performing ﬁne-grain extensive spectrum measure-
ment is critical to understanding the performance and limitations
of opportunistic spectrum access, and that the granularity of cur-
rent measurements is not enough to fully capture original owner’s
spectrum usage variations.
