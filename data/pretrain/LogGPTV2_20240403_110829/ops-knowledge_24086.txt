User: I'm trying to store a date into memcache using the following code:

from datetime import date
from google.appengine.api.memcache import Client

MEMCACHE_DATE_KEY = 'date'

client = Client()

def last_date():
    return client.get(MEMCACHE_DATE_KEY)

def new_date():
    client.set(MEMCACHE_DATE_KEY, date.today())

I am getting this error:

How can i use memcache with app-engine-patch?
Thanks for your time.
Assistant: It looks like you're attempting to make a memcache call at import time. Judging from the stacktrace, Django imports your modules before it sets up the App Engine environment, and therefore any calls to App Engine services at the module level will fail on the development server.
Move the call to memcache inside a function that's called from a request handler, and it should resolve your problem.
