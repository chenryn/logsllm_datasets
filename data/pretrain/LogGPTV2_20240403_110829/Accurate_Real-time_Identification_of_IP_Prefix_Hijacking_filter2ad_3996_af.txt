within some time window after detecting suspicious hijack-
ing attempts is also shown, with the CDF of time intervals
illustrated in Figure 8. Even though the actual percentage
of hijacked pre(cid:2)xes used for spamming and the percent-
age of spam sources using hijacked pre(cid:2)xes are not known,
this result still shows non-negligible correlation between
highly likely hijacked pre(cid:2)xes and spam sources, indicating
a potential spamming mode of exploiting routing infrastruc-
tures.
6.3. Validation using spam source IPs
6.4. Reducing false positives and negatives
Hijacked IP pre(cid:2)xes are believed to be often used by
spammers to send spam. Ramachandran et al. [40] recently
found that non-trivial amount of spam was sent from short-
lived, possibly hijacked IP pre(cid:2)xes by analyzing network-
level behavior of spammers using spam collected via a
(cid:148)spam sinkhole(cid:148) or a honeypot-like spam domain. To vali-
date our work, we correlate our identi(cid:2)ed suspicious hijack-
ing attempts with the source IPs of the spam data in [40] for
the same two week time period.
Table 4 summarizes the correlation results, where
(cid:148)matched pre(cid:2)xes(cid:148) indicate pre(cid:2)xes appearing in both data
sets bounded by a time window of 3 days. To understand the
time-related spam behavior, the number of matched pre(cid:2)xes
Compared to most of previous work in detecting IP hi-
jacking, which solely relies on identi(cid:2)cation of MOAS con-
(cid:3)icts as the indication, our system successfully reduces
both the false positive and the false negative rate. Be-
cause of a wide range of valid reasons for MOAS and sub-
MOAS, alarming every MOAS or subMOAS con(cid:3)ict will
cause excessive false noti(cid:2)cations, which may overwhelm
network administrators and also hide important alarms for
real hijacking attacks.
In contrast, our scheme provides
more de(cid:2)nitive evidence for suspicious hijacking attacks by
checking the fundamental difference, i.e., data plane incon-
sistencies, between valid and hijacking cases and therefore
greatly reduces the likelihood of false positives. For ex-

ample, from Table 3, during the experiment period, 3685
MOAS con(cid:3)icts occurred (more than 1 MOAS con(cid:3)ict per
hour), which may be too frequent to be handled. After the
(cid:2)ngerprinting check, only 332 highly suspicious cases are
left for further investigation (cid:150) a huge reduction in false pos-
itives. On the other hand, MOAS-based detection schemes
also suffer from signi(cid:2)cant false negatives because attack-
ers can evade MOAS con(cid:3)icts (and thus the detection) al-
together by simply choosing the remaining 3 types of at-
tack schemes in section 3. Although our system cannot
completely remove false positives and false negatives that
may stem from changing (cid:2)ngerprints, server farms, and fak-
ing (cid:2)ngerprints, it successfully minimizes such possibilities
with a variety of veri(cid:2)cation schemes, e.g., using multiple
(cid:2)ngerprinting techniques (Note that although not adopted
in our system, resource-based or physical device based (cid:2)n-
gerprinting can be incorporated easily for more accuracy),
edge popularity check, relationship check, etc., making our
system more ef(cid:2)cient and incrementally deployable on the
current Internet.
7. Discussions and conclusions
We discuss several limitations with our work and plans
for future improvement. First, our system is triggered based
on anomalous routing updates. However, hijacking may not
be visible on the control plane, as the data plane is not guar-
anteed to be consistent with advertised routes. We plan to
explore continuous monitoring and performance-triggered
probing to augment the current approach. We also plan to
analyze in more detail the accuracy of (cid:2)ngerprinting tech-
niques. A second more serious limitation is that probing
will be limited by limited availability of vantage points and
increasing deployment of (cid:2)rewalls. We plan to explore the
coverage based on the probing location and network-based
(cid:2)ngerprints. Note that our system can be deployed either
by individual networks or by a centralized system. In the
latter case, we have demonstrated the scalability of the sys-
tem, but we did not address the issue of reliably notifying
the victims. This is challenging as the victim may not be
easily reached due to the impact of IP hijacking. Work by
Lad et al. [33] suggests the use of diverse paths, without
providing absolute guarantee.
In summary, we present a framework for accurate, real-
time IP address hijacking detection. Our work is based on
the novel insight that a real hijacking attack will result in
con(cid:3)icting data-plane (cid:2)ngerprints describing the hijacked
network. Using this key difference, we can signi(cid:2)cantly re-
duce both false positives and false negatives and more con-
(cid:2)dently identify IP hijacking without sacri(cid:2)cing ef(cid:2)ciency.
This is the (cid:2)rst work exploiting the consistency between
data-plane and control-plane information to identify IP hi-
jacking attacks. Our system can be incrementally deployed
without modifying any infrastructure nor requiring support
from networks. We have demonstrated the effectiveness and
ef(cid:2)ciency of a prototype system using real data.
