How to Use This Guide
What’s Included in This Guide
This guide consists primarily of chapters that tell you how to administer various 
Mac OS X Server network services:  
•
DHCP
•
DNS
•
IP Firewall
•
NAT
•
VPN
•
NTP
•
IPv6 Support
Using This Guide
Each chapter covers a specific network service. Read any chapter that’s about a service 
you plan to provide to your users. Learn how the service works, what it can do for you, 
strategies for using it, how to set it up for the first time, and how to administer it over 
time.
Also take a look at chapters that describe services with which you’re unfamiliar. You 
may find that some of the services you haven’t used before can help you run your 
network more efficiently and improve performance for your users.
Most chapters end with a section called “Where to Find More Information.” This section 
points you to websites and other reference material containing more information 
about the service.

    How to Use This Guide
Setting Up Mac OS X Server for the First Time
If you haven’t installed and set up Mac OS X Server, do so now. 
•
Refer to 
Mac OS X Server Getting Started for Version 10.3 or Later,
 the document that 
came with your software, for instructions on server installation and setup. For many 
environments, this document provides all the information you need to get your 
server up, running, and available for initial use.
•
Review this guide to determine which services you’d like to refine and expand, to 
identify new services you’d like to set up, and to learn about the server applications 
you’ll use during these activities.
•
Read specific chapters to learn how to continue setting up individual services. Pay 
particular attention to the information in these sections:  “Setup Overview,” “Before 
You Begin,” and “Setting Up for the First Time.”
Getting Help for Everyday Management Tasks
If you want to change settings, monitor services, view service logs, or do any other day-
to-day administration task, you can find step-by-step procedures by using the on-
screen help available with server administration programs. While all the network 
services’ administration tasks are also documented in the network services 
administration guide, sometimes it’s more convenient to retrieve information in 
onscreen help form while using your server.
Getting Additional Information
In addition to this document, you’ll find information about Mac OS X Server:
•
In 
Mac OS X Server Getting Started for Version 10.3 or Later,
 which tells you how to 
install and set up your server initially.
•
At www.apple.com/server.
•
In onscreen help on your server.
•
In Read Me files on your server CD.

DHCP Service
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) service lets you administer and distribute 
IP addresses to client computers from your server. When you configure the DHCP 
server, you assign a block of IP addresses that can be made available to clients. Each 
time a client computer configured to use DHCP starts up, it looks for a DHCP server on 
your network. If a DHCP server is found, the client computer then requests an IP 
address. The DHCP server checks for an available IP address and sends it to the client 
computer along with a “lease period” (the length of time the client computer can use 
the address) and configuration information.
You can use the DHCP module in Server Admin to:
•
Configure and administer DHCP service.
•
Create and administer subnets.
•
Configure DNS, LDAP, and WINS options for client computers.
•
View DHCP address leases.
If your organization has more clients than IP addresses, you’ll benefit from using DHCP 
service. IP addresses are assigned on an as-needed basis, and when they’re not needed, 
they’re available for use by other clients. You can use a combination of static and 
dynamic IP addresses for your network if you need to. Read the next section for more 
information about static and dynamic allocation of IP addresses.
Organizations may benefit from the features of DHCP service, such as the ability to set 
Domain Name System (DNS) and Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) options 
for client computers without additional client configuration.
Before You Set Up DHCP Service
Before you set up DHCP service, read this section for information about creating 
subnets, assigning static and dynamic IP addresses, locating your server on the 
network, and avoiding reserved IP addresses.

    DHCP Service
Creating Subnets
Subnets are groupings of computers on the same network that simplify administration. 
You can organize subnets any way that is useful to you. For example, you can create 
subnets for different groups within your organization or for different floors of a 
building. Once you have grouped client computers into subnets, you can configure 
options for all the computers in a subnet at one time instead of setting options for 
individual client computers. Each subnet needs a way to connect to the other subnets. 
A hardware device called a 
router
 typically connects subnets.
Assigning IP Addresses Dynamically
With dynamic allocation, an IP address is assigned for a limited period of time (the 
lease 
time
) or until the client computer doesn’t need the IP address, whichever comes first. By 
using short leases, DHCP can reassign IP addresses on networks that have more 
computers than available IP addresses.
Addresses allocated to Virtual Private Network (VPN) clients are distributed much like 
DHCP addresses, but they don’t come out of the same range of addresses as DHCP. If 
you plan on using VPN, be sure to leave some addresses unallocated by DHCP for use 
by VPN. To learn more about VPN, see Chapter 5, “VPN Service,” on page 71.
Using Static IP Addresses
Static IP addresses are assigned to a computer or device once and then don’t change. 
You may want to assign static IP addresses to computers that must have a continuous 
Internet presence, such as web servers. Other devices that must be continuously 
available to network users, such as printers, may also benefit from static IP addresses.
Static IP addresses must be set up manually by entering the IP address on the 
computer or device that is assigned the address. Manually configured static IP 
addresses avoid possible issues certain services may have with DHCP-assigned 
addresses and avoid the delay required for DHCP to assign an address.
Don’t include Static IP address ranges in the range distributed by DHCP.
Locating the DHCP Server
When a client computer looks for a DHCP server, it broadcasts a message. If your DHCP 
server is on a different subnet from the client computer, you must make sure the 
routers that connect your subnets can forward the client broadcasts and the DHCP 
server responses. A relay agent or router on your network that can relay BootP 
communications will work for DHCP. If you don’t have a means to relay BootP 
communications, you must place the DHCP server on the same subnet as your client.

Interacting With Other DHCP Servers
You may already have other DHCP servers on your network, such as AirPort Base 
Stations. Mac OS X Server can coexist with other DHCP servers as long as each DHCP 
server uses a unique pool of IP addresses. However, you may want your DHCP server to 
provide an LDAP server address for client auto-configuration in managed 
environments. AirPort Base Stations can’t provide an LDAP server address. Therefore, if 
you want to use the auto-configuration feature, you must set up AirPort Base Stations 
in Ethernet-bridging mode and have Mac OS X Server provide DHCP service. If the 
AirPort Base Stations are on separate subnets, then your routers must be configured to 
forward client broadcasts and DHCP server responses as described previously. If you 
wish to provide DHCP service with AirPort Base Stations then you can’t use the client 
auto-configuration feature and you must manually enter LDAP server addresses at 
client workstations.
Using Multiple DHCP Servers on a Network
You can have multiple DHCP servers on the same network. However, it’s important that 
they’re configured properly as to not interfere with each other. Each server needs a 
unique pool of IP addresses to distribute.
Assigning Reserved IP Addresses
Certain IP addresses can’t be assigned to individual hosts. These include addresses 
reserved for loopback and addresses reserved for broadcasting. Your ISP won’t assign 
such addresses to you. If you try to configure DHCP to use such addresses, you’ll be 
warned that the addresses are invalid, and you’ll need to enter valid addresses.
Getting More Information on the DHCP Process
Mac OS X Server uses a daemon process called “bootpd” that is responsible for the 
DHCP Service’s address allocation. You can learn more about bootpd and its advanced 
configuration options by accessing its man page using the Terminal utility.
Setting Up DHCP Service for the First Time
If you used the Setup Assistant to configure ports on your server when you installed 
Mac OS X Server, some DHCP information is already configured. You need to follow the 
steps in this section to finish configuring DHCP service. You can find more information 
about settings for each step in “Managing DHCP Service” on page 10.
Step 1:  Create subnets
The following instructions show you how to create a pool of IP addresses that are 
shared by the client computers on your network. You create one range of shared 
addresses per subnet. These addresses are assigned by the DHCP server when a client 
issues a request.
See “Creating Subnets in DHCP Service” on page 10.
