User: I'm using python 2.5 in windows on a macbook pro with IDLE. How do I get previously typed commands in the python shell? In other operating systems I've managed to do this using 'ctrl' + 'up arrow' or a similar combination. I've tried all likely combinations without success.
Thanks.
Assistant: check if there is ipython available on windows .. that offers line history, tab completion and many other nice features
