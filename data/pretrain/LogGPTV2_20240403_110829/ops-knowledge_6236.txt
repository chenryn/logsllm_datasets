Question: You are designing a system that handles various types of files uploaded by users. To mitigate the risk of deploying the wrong handler for processing these files, which of the following actions should be included in your design?
"A": "Implement a function that checks the file extension and compares it with the file content to ensure consistency before processing.",
"B": "Allow all file types to be processed by a generic handler that does not perform any type-specific operations.",
"C": "Deploy separate handlers for each file type and use a random selection algorithm to choose which handler to use for each file.",
"D": "Require that all files have a corresponding digital signature that the handler verifies before processing."
Answer: A
