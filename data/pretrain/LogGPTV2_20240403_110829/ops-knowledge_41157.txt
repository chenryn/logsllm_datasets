User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Where to grant an account permissions for event log My asp.net application does not have the permission to write to windows event log. It is running under Network Service account. Is there any tool/management console rather than hack in the registry to guaranty the permission? Thanks!

Btw. I'm using Windows Server 2003.
