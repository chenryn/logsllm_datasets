### Potential Leakage of Sensitive IP Address Information

When transitioning from internal or VPN environments to external networks, there is a risk of leaking potentially sensitive IP address information. 

### Network Health and Flow Volume

**Figure 1: Network Health from the End-Host Perspective**

- **Top Panel:** The average hourly network health during our trace.
- **Bottom Panel:** The time series of flow volume.

Despite pronounced diurnal and work-week patterns in flow volume, the network health remains consistently low at around 66%. Surprisingly, this low health does not translate into user complaints about poor performance. IT personnel attribute this to users often being unaware of the causes of sluggish performance, such as network errors or bloated applications, and thus passively accepting mediocre performance. However, for web traffic (ports 80, 88, 443, 8080), there is a positive correlation between health and activity; failure rates are lower during working hours.

### Impact of User Environment on Failure Rates

The user's environment significantly impacts the rate of failures:

- **Enterprise Network (Wired or Wireless):** 34% of flows fail.
- **VPN:** 57% of flows fail.
- **External (No VPN):** 17% of flows fail.

These numbers are higher in our network due to less restrictive policies, allowing users to install arbitrary applications, with only a small blacklist (e.g., BitTorrent).

For outgoing connections, 77% of failures occur within the first minute of acquiring a new IP address, rising to 90% within the first four minutes. Most of these failures (87%) are to destinations previously contacted by the user. This behavior is consistent with applications attempting to reestablish connections broken by network transitions, but failing when the reachability of the new network differs from the previous one.

### Sensitive Information Leakage

This reconnection behavior can leak sensitive information in external networks. For example:

- **Internal IP Addresses and Ports:** 1969 internal IP address and port pairs were leaked.
- **DNS Requests:** Over 63K DNS requests failed in external environments, likely leaking internal hostnames.

This is concerning because applications intended for internal use may not authenticate servers, assuming the network is trusted. Attackers on external networks can exploit this by spoofing IP addresses or DNS responses to collect user credentials or launch man-in-the-middle attacks.

### Variation in Failure Rates Across Users

**Figure 2: Fraction of Failed Flows Across Users**

- **User Variability:** The fraction of failed flows varies widely across users.
- **Top Users:** The top 1% of users are responsible for 15% of all failures, attributed to misconfigured applications.

### Applications and Their Failure Rates

**Figure 3: Failure Rates of Top Ten Applications**

- **Popular Applications:** Infrastructure apps used by the entire population.
- **Less Popular Applications:** Apps installed by a small number of users (< 20).

#### Key Applications

- **Software Patching Service:** High failure rates due to its unique service-discovery design, which involves periodic probing of hundreds of patch servers.
- **Anti-Virus Application:** High failure rates due to periodic polling for updates, even outside the enterprise network.
- **Monitoring Applications:** Two monitoring apps and a music streaming app, which fail due to misconfiguration and improper masquerading as SSL and VPN traffic.

### Types of Failures

**Figure 5: Retry Intervals During Outages**

- **Persistent Retries:** Many failures are due to applications persistently initiating new flows despite repeated failures. These retries are often more frequent than necessary, leading to a large number of failures.

### Conclusion

To improve network health, it is essential to address the root causes of these failures, including better application configuration, stricter network policies, and more efficient retry mechanisms.
