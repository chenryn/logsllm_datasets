User: How to start a Docker container on AWS EC2?
Assistant: Here are the steps to start a Docker container on AWS EC2: 1. Install docker: Use the following command on the EC2 instance for docker installation. ``` sudo yum update -y sudo yum install -y docker ``` 2. Start the docker service: Use the following command to start the docker service on the EC2 instance. ``` sudo service docker start ``` 3. Create a Docker image: You can use the following command to create a Docker image from a Dockerfile. ``` sudo docker build -t IMAGE_NAME PATH_TO_DOCKERFILE ``` 4. Run Docker container: You can use the following command to run a Docker container in a Docker image. ``` sudo docker run -d --name CONTAINER_NAME IMAGE_NAME ``` Among them, the `--name` option is the name of the container, and the `-d` option is to run the container in the background. Additionally you can use the `-p` option to expose the port of the container so that the container can be accessed externally. For example: ``` sudo docker run -d --name CONTAINER_NAME -p 80:80 IMAGE_NAME ``` can expose port number 80 and map it to port 80 in the EC2 instance. These steps will run a Docker container on AWS EC2, and then you can access the running container to see if it is running properly.
