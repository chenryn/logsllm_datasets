# Exploit Archaeology: Unearthing and Leveraging Retro Hardware

## Introduction
Welcome to the first in a series of talks on excavating and exploiting retro hardware. I promise, this talk will get technical.

### Who Am I?
- **Penetration Tester**
- **Geek Dad**
- **Amateur Phone Phreak**
- **@savant42 on Twitter**

### Who I’m Not
- **Leet (Elite) Hacker**
- **Programmer**
- **Reverse Engineer**
- **Speller**

### Why This Talk?
This talk explores the transformation of a 50-pound payphone into a stealth attack platform. We'll focus on the methodology rather than just the results, and share the journey of making it happen.

## The Journey Begins
Traveling with a payphone is a significant hassle. Payphones used to be commonplace, but now they are rare and often viewed with suspicion. Despite this, I've always wanted my own payphone, and one day, I received one as a gift (thanks, Tiffany & Gene Erik).

### Payphones Today
- **Correctional Facilities**: Still popular.
- **Mine**: Came from a prison and was thoroughly cleaned.

### BOCOT vs. COCOT
- **BOCOT (Bell Owned Coin Operated Telephone)**: Telco-owned, can be "Red Boxed" using inband ACTS tones.
- **COCOT (Customer Owned Coin Operated Telephone)**: Privately owned, cannot be Red Boxed without operator intervention.

### Distinguishing Between BOCOT and COCOT
- **BOCOT**: Uses General Electric style housing, coin return on the left, armored cable connects to the front.
- **COCOT**: Often uses GTE style housing, coin return on the right, armored cable connects on the side.

### My Payphone
- **Elcotel Series 5 Line-Powered Payphone**: Internal battery, trickle charges from line voltage, "smart" phone with internal programming and rate handling.

### Initial Challenges
- **No Keys**
- **No Battery**
- **No Documentation**
- **Phone from a Different Area Code**

### Opening the Phone
- **Preserving the Tomb**: No destructive entry, keeping the phone intact.
- **Three Types of Keys**:
  - **Upper Housing Lock**: 3 pins, no security pins, easy to pick.
  - **Coin Vault Lock**: 4 pins, several spool pins, Medeco lock, more challenging to pick.
  - **T Wrench for Torque**: Essential for opening the housing.

### Hacker Con Experience
- **Bay Threat in Mountain View**: 30 people tried to pick the coin vault lock, only one succeeded by accident.

### Getting It Open
- **Hacking Together a Solution**: Using a badge clip, wrench, and faith, we managed to open the housing.
- **Dead Battery**: Replaced with a new one.

### Making It Work
- **Different Area Code**: Local calls were expensive.
- **Goals**:
  - Zero out the rates tables to make free calls.
  - Find vulnerabilities in the payphone software.
  - Profit?

### First Hack
- **Payphone -> ATA -> Asterisk -> 911**: Dial plan magic allowed a usable dial tone after dialing 911, but it was a sloppy solution.

### Documentation
- **Nearly Non-Existent**: Archive.org provided some help.
- **Elcotel Manuals**: Found part 2 of a 3-part series, which was somewhat useful.

### Programming Methods
- **Software-Based Reprogramming**: Requires software and a license from a defunct company.
- **Local Telemetry**: Open the phone, default it, and follow voice prompts.
- **Remote Telemetry**: Allegedly possible to reprogram remotely.

### Cracking the Software
- **16-bit Windows “NE” Binary**: Challenging even with tools like IDA Pro.
- **Help from Friends**: Vyrus001, int0x80, Frank^2, and others helped crack the software.

### Onboard Modem
- **PCM (Payphone Control Module)**: Needed to dial it, but I don't have a landline.
- **Unlocked Linksys Analog Telephone Adapter (ATA)** and **USB Modem**: Used for VoIP settings.

### Defaulting the Phone
- **Press and Hold Button Inside**: Flash the hook, listen to onboard prompts.
- **Local Telemetry**: Press button, flash hook, enter code, follow voice prompts.

### Anti-Fraud Mechanisms
- **Secondary Dialtone Detection**
- **Red Box Detection**
- **Chassis Alarms**
- **Brute Force Protection**

### Fuzzing the Phone
- **Intercept Modem Audio**: SIP made it easy, but FSK demodulation was challenging.
- **Blackbox RE of Protocol**: Intercept and analyze how the software works.

### Authentication
- **Default Passwords**: 99999999 for software reprogramming, 88888888 for local and remote telemetry.
- **Auth Protocol Breakdown**: Success (0x06) vs. Fail (0x15).

### Hacks
- **Pseudo Code**: Brute force PIN until successful.
- **Python Serial Interaction Library**: Gene Erik helped with the code.

### Remote Telemetry
- **Reprogramming Using DTMF**: Registers and options, including disabling anti-fraud mechanisms and alarms.

### Service Desk
- **Sudo/Operator Status**: Can apply credit, issue refunds, force free calls, and dump coin escrow.

### Novel Uses
- **ProjectMF**: Blue Box simulation of inband signaling over TDM trunks.
- **Red Boxing**: Use sox and Asterisk EAGI to record and analyze inbound audio.

### Malicious Uses
- **PayPwn**: Unlocked Linksys PAP2 ATA + PwnPlug + Alfa Wireless USB = covert adventurer/badass.
- **Asterisk system() Command**: Pass OS calls from DTMF, macro popular pentesting tools, use Cepstral/Festival TTS for responses.

### Demo
- **Nmap by Phone**: PwnPlug with built-in support for slimmed-down Asterisk, use Alfa to hook into a wireless network, initiate scans, and more.

### Call Interception
- **Asterisk ChanSpy() Application**: Monitor all voice traffic through PBX.
- **Casino Roll**: Wait for people to use the phone, listen, and intercept calls.

## Summary
Using this information, we can utilize Remote Telemetry to control any Elcotel Payphone. This archaeological dig reveals much about past developer thinking and can be applied to other legacy systems like SCADA. PayPwn is limited only by your imagination.
