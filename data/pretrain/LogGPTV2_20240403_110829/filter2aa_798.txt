Exploit Archaeology
First in the series of talks on excavating and 
exploiting retro hardware.
I promise the talk will get technical.
Who am I?

• Amateur Phone Phreak
• @savant42 on the twitters
Who I’m not.
• Leet.
• A programmer.
• A reverse engineer-er.
• A speller.

The Journey
And to see if I could.
First Off...
Traveling with a 
Payphone is a giant 
pain in the ass.
Anyway.
Payphones used to be like this.
Nowadays they’re like this.
If you see a payphone in your 
neighborhood today, you laugh.
If you see someone using a payphone?
 You lock your car doors 
and roll up the windows.
Even Indy is over it.
Ever since I was a kid
I’ve always wanted my very 
own payphone
One day, I got one as a 
gift.
(Thanks Tiffany & Gene 
Erik)
Still popular in correctional facilities
This one came from a prison. No joke.
(Yes, I cleaned the ever loving shit out of it)
• BOCOT = Bell Owned Coin Operated 
Telephone (Telco Owned)
• COCOT = Customer Owned Coin 
Operated Telephone (Private)
BOCOT vs. COCOT
Bell Owned
BOCOTS could be “Red Boxed” (utilize 
inband ACTS tones to signal coin insertion)
It’s probably still possible in certain regions 
of the US but most RBOCs have outsourced 
to private companies.
COCOT Payphones can not be Red Boxed 
without Operator Intervention (as far as *I* 
know) because they don’t use ACTS
With “Smart Payphones” all of the call 
regulation, coin counting and management, 
etc, is done inside the payphone.
Telco payphones do all the magic at the 
Central Ofﬁce.
Telling the difference?
Most (All?) BOCOT Payphones use the 
General Electric style housing
Coin Return is on the Left and the 
armored cable connects to the 
front of the housing.
COCOTS often use the GTE style housing with the coin 
return slot on the right and the armored cable connects 
on the side. This is deﬁnitely not always the case, though.
This Payphone.
Elcotel Series 5 Line-Powered Payphone
Internal Battery, trickle charges from voltage 
on the telephone line
“Smart” Phone, Programming/Rates are 
handled internal to the Payphone
Elcotel used to be proliﬁc with the private 
coin phone market
Now they’re all but gone from most places
Now that I have one
Problem?
No keys.
No battery.
No documentation.
Phone was from 
different area code.
How to do?
Get the phone open
Replace the battery
Reprogram for free calls.
Opening the phone
Preserving the tomb.
No destructive entry, wanted to keep the 
phone as intact as possible.
Three types of Keys
Upper Housing
Lower housing (coin vault)
T  wrench for torque.
You need all three.
Upper Housing Lock
3 pins, no security Pins. Easy enough to pick 
in a short period of time.
Anti-impressioning divots.
Note: These locks tend to only rotate a 
quarter of a turn or less. Check, you may 
have already picked it.
Coin Vault Lock?
Not so much.
4 Pins, several spool pins.
Medeco Locks, though not biaxial
At that time, I was unable to pick it.
Hacker Con
Took the phone to Bay 
Threat in Mountain View
30 people tried, failed.
Except one guy.
Dude picked this lock in 
10 seconds, by accident. 
Fuuuuuuuuuuu.
Opening the housing
Didn’t have a T 
wrench, time to hack 
harder.
Opening the housing
Vyrus001 and I were 
able to hack something 
together.
Badge clip, wrench, 
faith.
Opening the housing
Dead battery.
Payphone.com
u mad bro?
Now that it is alive
How the @#%#% do I use it?
How to do?
Different area code means local (to me) calls 
were $$$$$$$
Unacceptable.
The goals:
• Zero out the rates tables to make free calls
• Find vulnerabilities in payphone software
• ...
• Proﬁt?
GOALS:
First Hack:
Payphone -> ATA -> Asterisk -> 911
Payphones are legally required to make 911 a 
free call.
Dial plan magic allowed me to get a usable 
dial tone if I ﬁrst dialed 911.
Neat hack, but sloppy.
Documentation?
Nearly non-existent.
Archive.org was helpful, to an extent.
I learned how to reset phone to default, but 
that’s pretty much it.
Elcotel?
Ebay!
Incomplete.
Was only able to ﬁnd part 
2 of a 3 part series of 
manuals.
Basically, this was the 
rosetta stone.
Part 2 was useful, 
but I still didn’t 
have the software 
to reprogram it.
• 1. Software based reprogramming
• 2. Local telemetry 
• 3. Remote Telemetry 
3 Ways to Program:
Software
Ideal solution, but requires the software and 
a license from a dead company.
Local Telemetry
• Open the Phone (which WILL set off 
alarms and call the phone owner if you try 
this in the ﬁeld)
• Default the Phone
• Listen to voice prompts and dial to set 
values.
Remote Telemetry
Can allegedly reprogram remotely? (More on 
this later)
Eventually I was able to acquire a demo 
through “alternative means.”
Time to try and crack the software.
Software based programming
Cracking 10 year old software 
is actually pretty hard.
16-bit Windows “NE” Binary
Even IDA Pro was all “WTF 
Mate?”
And by “help”, I mean that someone did it 
for me.
Eventually able to hook the installer, jump 
the serial number check, uncompress the 
installer archives.
Thanks to Vyrus001, int0x80, Frank^2
I had a lot of help.
Phone has onboard modem called a 
“PCM” (Payphone Control Module)
Need to be able to dial it though.
Ironically, I don’t have a landline.
Unlocked Linksys 
Analog Telephone 
Adapter (ATA)
USB Modem
Voice over IP
Voip Settings
• Dial up modem over VoIP is a pain in the 
ass.
• Ulaw or Alaw, accept no substitions.
• Disable Noise Cancellation + Echo 
suppression
• Really slow, ~ 9600 baud
A HUGE Thanks! to the Telephreak guys (Hi 
Beave!) and the Oldskoolphreak.com guys 
for helping me get this sorted out.
Default the phone
Press and hold the 
button inside the phone.
Flash the hook.
Listen to onboard 
prompts
Local Telemetry
Press the button, ﬂash the hook, enter the 
code, follow the voice prompts.
Super easy, but requires you to physically 
open the phone. 
If the phone is not yours, this is dubious.
Now we can connect.
Once you are able to connect, the rest is 
pretty easy.
But this talk is also about hacks, not using 
software.
Elcotel Engineers? Not total idiots.
Anti-fraud Mechanisms:
•
Secondary Dialtone Detection
•
Red box detection
•
Chassis Alarms
•
Brute Force Protection
Need to build a harness to fuzz the phone.
Intercept modem audio?
• Easy enough with SIP, but then what?
FSK Demodulation is crazy hard.
Blackbox RE of Protocol
If I could intercept and analyze how the 
software does it, I can do it myself.
How do I hook a USB Modem?
Advanced Serial Port Monitor Pro
• http://www.aggsoft.com/serial-port-
monitor.htm
• Able to treat USB Modem as virtual serial 
port
• “Spy Mode” allows you to pass through and 
watch
• Displays output in either Hex or ASCII
Default password for software 
reprogramming is 99999999
Default password for local and remote 
telemetry is 88888888
Password?
Performing actions using the PNM Plus Elcotel 
application enabled me to see what actions 
look like in Hexadecimal
From there I was able to make *some* sense 
of how the handshake worked
Phone ID is usually the last 4 digits of the 
phone number.
Passwords are almost never changed from 
defaults.
Demo
Oh dear $deity please work.
Auth Protocol Breakdown
Success vs. Fail
• When authentication fails, the Phone sends 
a hexadecimal NAK (Negative 
Acknowledgement)
• 0x15
• When authentication is successful, Phone 
sends hexadecimal ACK (Acknowledge)
• 0x06
Problem.
After 3 invalid attempts, the phone drops the 
call.
However, the PNM software is responsible 
for interpreting the “disconnect” message.
If we use our own code we can ignore that 
and keep trying until we get the right PIN.
Hacks.
Pseudo Code:
PIN = 0000
send $PIN
while ($auth_response != 0x06)
$PIN++
send $PIN
if $auth_response = 0x06, print “GREAT 
SUCCESS!”
Python has a good 
serial interaction 
library, but I don’t 
code because I’m 
an idiot.
So Gene Erik jumped in.
Man I love having smart friends.

Code will be online some time after Defcon 
hangover clears.
• User ID? Check.
• Pin? Check.
• ...
• Proft?
• Call payphone from any landline phone
• Wait 30 seconds for Modem to stop 
screaming at you
• Have 10 seconds to enter telemetry 
password
• Listen to voice prompts
Enter: Remote 
Telemetry
Reprogramming using DTMF
(Remote Telemetry)
• Registers = Strings
• Options = On or Off
• Reg. 421-434 = Antifraud. Set to 0 to 
disable.
• Reg. 333-336, 412, and 414 = Disable alarms
More registers
• 404 = Phone number
• 402 = Phone ID#
• 403 = PNM Plus Password
• 400 = Telemetry Password
• 116 = Disable battery (DoS)
• 338 = Number for service desk 
Service Desk
•
Sudo/Operator status for Payphones
•
If you divert this number to yourself, you can do cool stuff.
•
Apply credit
•
Issue refunds
•
Force phone to dial number for free
•
Dump the coin escrow ($$$$)
We can set the “coin escrow” to $5.
As people use the phone, up to $5 in coins 
collect in the escrow hopper. 
Service desk can cause hopper to empty into 
coin return slot.
Demo?
How can we use this information in a novel 
way?
Now what?
ProjectMF
Blue Box simulation of Inband signalling over 
TDM trunks.
www.projectmf.org
Red Boxing
• Use sox and Asterisk EAGI to record and 
analyze inbound audio.
• Filter out all frequencies that are not 1700 
Hz and 2200 Hz tones together
• If not null, incremend $coin_value
• If $coin_value >= $.25, make call
How can we use 
this information in 
a malicious ways?
Now what?
• Unlocked Linksys PAP2 ATA + PwnPlug + 
Alfa Wireless USB wireless = PayPwn!
• Asterisk system() command lets us pass OS 
calls from DTMF
• Macro the most popular pentesting tools
• Cepstral/Festival TTS to receive responses
Nmap by Phone
Demo!
• PwnPlug has built in support for slimmed 
down Asterisk.
• Use Alfa to hook into a wireless network
• DTMF to initiate scans, cracking, etc etc
There *are* easier ways to do this, but what 
the hell? This is fun.
Be honest with me. If you saw a Payphone, 
would you expect it to be a covert 
adventurer/badass?
Using the Asterisk ChanSpy() application we 
can monitor *all* voice trafﬁc that goes 
through PBX.
Roll payphone into a Casino. Wait for people 
to use the phone. Listen. Magic.
Call Interception
Demo. Volunteer?
In summary
Using this information we can utilize Remote 
Telemetry to own any Elcotel Payphone
Like any archaeological dig, we can learn a lot 
about the way developers used to think
We can then apply this logic to other legacy 
systems still in the ﬁeld (SCADA, etc)
PayPwn = Only limited by your imagination
If I have my way, they 
will live forever.
