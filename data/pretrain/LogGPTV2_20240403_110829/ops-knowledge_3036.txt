If you are considering using Google App Engine (GAE) for a large-scale website, there are several factors to take into account. While GAE can be a powerful and scalable platform, it does come with some limitations that might impact your project, especially if you anticipate a high volume of traffic or have specific requirements.

Here are some key points to consider:

1. **File Size Limitations**: As you mentioned, GAE has a 1MB limit for file storage in the Blobstore. However, this is subject to change, as noted in the GAE roadmap. For larger files, you may need to use Google Cloud Storage, which integrates well with GAE but incurs additional costs.

2. **Query Limits**: The 1,000 result limit per query can be a significant constraint. If your application requires more extensive data retrieval, you will need to implement pagination or other strategies to handle this limitation.

3. **Scalability and Performance**: GAE is designed to scale automatically, but it may not be the best choice for extremely high-traffic websites. Consider the expected number of simultaneous users, queries per second, and database load. If you anticipate very high demand, you might want to explore other platforms like Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) or a custom solution on Google Compute Engine (GCE).

4. **Web Framework Compatibility**: You mentioned using web2py with GAE. While web2py is a robust framework, ensure that it is compatible with GAE's environment and constraints. Some frameworks may require additional configuration or may not fully support all GAE features.

5. **Cost Considerations**: GAE offers a free tier, but as your usage grows, so will your costs. Make sure to estimate and budget for potential expenses, including compute, storage, and network usage.

To better understand whether GAE is suitable for your needs, it would be helpful to know more about the expected scale of your website. Specifically, how many simultaneous users do you anticipate? What is the estimated query rate and database load?
