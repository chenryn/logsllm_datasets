Continuing from this discussion: https://discuss.atom.io/t/double-icon-when-
pinned/17320/24
I've got Atom installed on Windows 10. I open the application, then right
click the icon in the taskbar, then click Pin to Taskbar. This creates a
duplicate (second) icon on the taskbar. The first icon is the actual instance
of the app running, and it goes away when the app is closed. The second icon
stays permanently. If I click the second icon while Atom is closed, it adds
the first icon back to my taskbar.
Any ideas as to what I can do to fix this?
