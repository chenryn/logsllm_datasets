Following up on the discussion from [this thread](https://discuss.atom.io/t/double-icon-when-pinned/17320/24):

I have Atom installed on Windows 10. When I open the application, right-click the icon in the taskbar, and select "Pin to Taskbar," a duplicate (second) icon appears on the taskbar. The first icon represents the active instance of the application and disappears when I close Atom. However, the second icon remains permanently. If I click the second icon while Atom is closed, it adds the first (active) icon back to the taskbar.

Does anyone have any suggestions for how to resolve this issue?
