##### Description of the problem
I have a .obj and .mtl which load textures from .tga files. This all seems to
work / look fine in 3D modeling software, but when loaded with three.js
(THREE.WebGLRenderer({ antialias: true })) some of the object's children,
(specifically between the knees and the calves, but not, for example, the
pockets and legs), seem to have a transparent jagged gap / empty triangles.
(Tried turning on antialiasing, changing the overdraw value, turning off
transparency, etc.)
Demo project and files: demo.zip
Potential problem area: "Forgive my ignorance, but code starting at line 306
in OBJLoader.js seems to imply a fixed side limit/requirement for all faces.
The obj file in question shows some faces with more than 4 sides. For example
see line 60067 in the obj file. There are more after. It's as if a cut tool
has healed cut seams with complex faces." -
