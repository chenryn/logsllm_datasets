User: Certain applications like hellanzb have a way of printing to the terminal with the appearance of dynamically refreshing data, kind of like top().
Whats the best method in python for doing this?  I have read up on logging and curses, but don't know what to use.  I am creating a reimplementation of top.  If you have any other suggestions I am open to them as well.
Assistant: I don't think that including another libraries in this situation is really good practice. So, solution:
print("\rCurrent: %s\t%s" % (str(<value>), <another_value>), end="")
