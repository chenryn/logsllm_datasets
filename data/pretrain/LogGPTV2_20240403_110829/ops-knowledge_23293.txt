User: When I execute jupyter notebook in my virtual environment in Arch Linux, the following error occurred.
Error executing Jupyter command 'notebook': [Errno 2] No such file or directory
My Python version is 3.6, and my Jupyter version is 4.3.0
How can I resolve this issue?
Assistant: For me the fix was simply running pip install notebook
Somehow the original Jupiter install got borked along the way.
