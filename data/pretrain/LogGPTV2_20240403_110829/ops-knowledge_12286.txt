User: How to achieve centralized system management with Ansible?
Assistant: The following are the steps to use Ansible to achieve centralized system management: 1. Install Ansible: Ansible must be installed in all systems that need to be managed. 2. Configure Ansible: Set the necessary options, such as timeout, log, etc., in the Ansible configuration file (usually in /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg). 3. Configure the Ansible host list: the hosts file specifies all the hosts and groups to be managed by the Ansible controller, which can be divided into different groups according to needs to perform different tasks. 4. Create Ansible Playbook: Playbook is an Ansible configuration file, which contains tasks and operations, can be used to manage a group of hosts or a host, and supports various task processes, such as installing software packages and configuration files with yum system and so on. 5. Run Ansible Playbook: Use the ansible-playbook command to use the specified Playbook file to perform tasks and operations. You can use one-time commands to perform one-time tasks, or you can use cron jobs to perform long-term tasks periodically. Through the above steps, you can use Ansible to implement centralized system management, which makes it easier for you to manage and maintain a group of servers, and greatly reduces your repeated operations during management.
