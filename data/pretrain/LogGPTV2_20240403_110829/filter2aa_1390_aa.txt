## Abstract
Information visualization is a powerful tool for comprehending large datasets. For these systems to be effective, designers must be aware of potential manipulations and protect users from attacks. Users should also be informed about possible attacks to minimize their impact. These attacks target both the information visualization system and the perceptual, cognitive, and motor capabilities of human users. This paper presents a framework for analyzing the security of information visualization systems, a taxonomy of visualization attacks, and technology-independent principles for countering malicious visualizations. These concepts are illustrated with case studies and examples from the network security visualization domain, but they are broadly applicable to most information visualization systems.

## 1. Introduction
Information visualization systems used for decision-making must be designed with security in mind. These systems are vulnerable to attacks from malicious entities aiming to overwhelm, mislead, or distract the user, as well as from non-malicious entities that inadvertently cause similar effects. While some may believe that current systems are not targets for attack, the increasing use of information visualization in critical decision-making domains such as intelligence analysis, law enforcement, network security, and business decision support suggests otherwise. In these adversarial environments, malicious entities actively attempt to manipulate human users. We argue that there is a clear and growing threat, and for information visualization systems to remain relevant, security must be a priority.

Information visualization systems inherently involve humans in the decision-making loop. The human is the primary decision-maker who acts on the presented information, making them a high-value and likely target. Any part of the system, from data collection to final visualization, can be attacked to influence human interpretation. Even minor data compromises, such as changing a single bit, can have significant impacts (e.g., altering the foreground color of a scatter plot to match the background). Major compromises can have even more severe consequences. Our primary goal is to identify these threats and vulnerabilities and develop principles to counter or mitigate these attacks. By understanding the threats and weaknesses, designers can make informed decisions to mitigate vulnerabilities.

Consider a visual intrusion detection system (IDS) that supplements traditional anomaly-based and signature-based IDSs. Such systems are typically co-located with firewalls at the border between an internal network and the public internet, allowing them to observe and collect data from network traffic. Our example system collects header data from network traffic and visualizes it in real-time, capturing source and destination addresses, protocols, ports, and timestamps. An adversary can inject arbitrary data into this system due to weaknesses in networking protocols. In our scenario, the adversary knows the night shift operator is red-green colorblind and that the default settings map TCP to green, UDP to blue, and ICMP to red. The attacker launches an ICMP-based attack, knowing the operator will not notice the red packets among the green ones. This example illustrates how an attacker can exploit a specific user's condition and the system's color mapping.

To combat usability attacks, this work offers several contributions:
- A framework for analyzing the security of information visualization systems.
- A taxonomy of malicious attacks.
- Technology-independent principles for designing secure information visualization systems.
- Case studies and results from the design, implementation, and real-world use of a visual network IDS.

## 2. Related Work
This work stands out by providing a comprehensive analysis of the weaknesses in visualization systems, including data sources, communication, storage, processing, presentation, and human interpretation. We present a novel taxonomy of attacks and a set of technology-independent design principles to counter these attacks. Most research in information visualization focuses on the strengths and weaknesses of specific techniques, without considering the potential for malicious manipulation.

The fields of information warfare, psychological warfare, propaganda, and battlefield deception address the use of false or misleading information to change people's understanding through deception and confusion. Techniques such as distraction, misinformation, and disinformation are relevant but do not specifically address information visualization. We will consider these applications in our work.

Information visualization deals with abstract data sets that lack a natural physical or geometric representation, such as statistics, financial data, text, and software. Research into the manipulation of these systems is relatively rare. The VizLies special session at IEEE Visualization conferences has informally addressed malicious visualization, but only as entertainment. Tufte's work on "lie factor," disappearing baselines, misleading scales, and 3D graphics provides anecdotal instances of malicious visualizations. Other works, such as How to Lie with Charts and How to Lie with Statistics, explore techniques to mislead audiences. However, these focus on the creator's ability to manipulate, whereas our work assumes the creator is non-malicious and the attackers are external entities targeting the system and its users.

## 3. System Model
To understand how attackers can achieve their goals and analyze how malicious visualizations manifest, we developed a generic producer-consumer information visualization system using a holistic approach (Figure 1). This model helps identify assets by decomposing the system and prioritizing countermeasures.

- **Consumer:** A combination of a human and machine. The machine presents information to the human using a visualization method, typically visual. The human interacts with the interface using motor and speech commands and draws conclusions based on the presented information.
- **Producer:** The source of the data to be visualized. In some cases, the producer includes a human interacting with an information system to generate data.

By understanding the interactions and components of the system, we can better identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.
