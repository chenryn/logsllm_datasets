Maven integration tests currently do not work with security manager. There are
a couple easy to fix issues like passing the right system properties to give
access to .class files. However, a larger issue is the forked classloader the
maven failsafe plugin uses. We can disable this isolated classloader with
`useManifestOnlyJar=false`. However, the jars from maven itself then have jar
hell (the failsafe api jar and failsafe junit jar have duplicate classes). We
might be able to exclude the api jar (assuming the junit jar is a superset of
the classes).
