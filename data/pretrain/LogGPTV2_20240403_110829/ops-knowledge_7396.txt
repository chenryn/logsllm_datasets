User: I keep getting this error when running this python script (that I know runs and works since I ran it in VI) within eclipse.
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/kt/Documents/workspace/Molly's Scripts/src/ProcessingPARFuMSData.py", line 181, in 
    annotations = open(sys.argv[1], 'r')
IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'Tarr32_Lane2_Next34_FinalAnnotations.txt'
I double checked to see that all of the txt files that I need to run the script with are included in the specific directory and yet it is still giving me a bit of trouble. I know it has to be something with eclipse or PyDev because like I mentioned previously it works in the other editor. Any help would be appreciated and I can try a screen shot if one is needed.
Thanks,
KT
