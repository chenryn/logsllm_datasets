**Question: How do I perform multi-hop SCP transfers?**

I need to copy a file from my local machine (Machine A) to a remote server (Server C), but I can only access Server C through an intermediary server (Server B). 

Instead of first transferring the file to Server B, logging in, and then transferring it to Server C, is it possible to transfer the file directly using SCP or a similar program?

(Note: Emacs TRAMP mode supports this feature for editing files remotely.)

**Answer:**

Yes, you can perform a multi-hop SCP transfer using the `-o` option with the `ProxyCommand` setting. This allows you to specify a jump host (Server B) through which the connection to the final destination (Server C) will be made.

Here’s the command you can use:

```sh
scp -o ProxyCommand="ssh $jump_host nc %h %p" $local_path $destination_user@$destination_host:$destination_path
```

- **$jump_host**: The address of the intermediary server (Server B).
- **$local_path**: The path to the file on your local machine (Machine A).
- **$destination_user**: The username on the destination server (Server C).
- **$destination_host**: The address of the destination server (Server C).
- **$destination_path**: The path where you want to copy the file on the destination server (Server C).

For example, if you want to copy a file `file.txt` from your local machine to `user@serverC:/path/to/destination`, and you have to go through `serverB`, the command would be:

```sh
scp -o ProxyCommand="ssh serverB nc %h %p" file.txt user@serverC:/path/to/destination
```

This command will establish a direct SCP transfer from your local machine to Server C, using Server B as a jump host.

Alternatively, you can set up the `ProxyJump` option in your SSH configuration file (`~/.ssh/config`) for a more permanent solution:

```sh
Host serverC
  HostName serverC
  User user
  ProxyJump serverB
```

With this configuration, you can simply use the following command:

```sh
scp file.txt serverC:/path/to/destination
```

This setup will automatically use Server B as the jump host whenever you connect to Server C.
