User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How do I do Multihop SCP transfers? I want to copy a file from my machine A to server C, but only have access to server C through server B.

Instead of first transferring to server B, log in and then transfer to server C, Is is possible to transfer the file directly with SCP or similar programs? 

(Emacs tramp-mode has this feature for editing files remotely).

Assistant: You can add -o options to scp instead of .ssh/config.

scp -o ProxyCommand="ssh $jump_host nc $host 22" $local_path $host:$destination_path


$jump_host is your "server B" in this case.
