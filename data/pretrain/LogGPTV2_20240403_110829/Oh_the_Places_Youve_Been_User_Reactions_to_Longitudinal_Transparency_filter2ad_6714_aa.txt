## Abstract
Internet companies track users' online activity to make inferences about their interests, which are then used for targeted advertising and personalizing web experiences. Previous research has shown that existing privacy-protective tools provide users with only a limited understanding and an incomplete picture of online tracking. We present **Tracking Transparency**, a privacy-preserving browser extension that visualizes examples of long-term, longitudinal information that third-party trackers could have inferred from users' browsing. The extension uses a client-side topic modeling algorithm to categorize pages that users visit and combines this with data about the web trackers encountered over time to create these visualizations. In a longitudinal field study, 425 participants used one of six variants of our extension for a week. Our findings indicate that after using the extension, participants had more accurate perceptions of the extent of tracking and expressed intentions to take privacy-protective actions.

## 1. Introduction
Many websites embed scripts and ads provided by advertising networks or companies that select and display ads on websites. Using data from web requests, persistent cookies, and fingerprints, these entities (collectively termed "trackers") link records of a user's browsing activity across multiple web pages. These records can be used to infer the user's demographics and interests, enabling targeted advertising, where online ads are tailored for a particular user. Targeted advertising has come under increasing scrutiny as a threat to privacy and a potential enabler of discrimination based on race, age, sexual orientation, and other sensitive categories [5, 20, 39, 87].

Although targeted advertising is ubiquitous and has received substantial news coverage, prior work suggests that many people do not understand how they are tracked across websites or how their interests are inferred [95]. Users have limited means to learn about the extent and implications of third-party tracking and personalization. Advertising networks provide general explanations of ad targeting, and some companies show interests that have been inferred (Figures 1a, 1b), though these explanations have been shown to be incomplete and possibly misleading [4, 89, 99]. User-installed browser extensions (Figures 1c, 1d) highlight the trackers on the web pages a user visits but provide limited insight into longitudinal tracking and do not explain what companies have learned and inferred about users' interests over the long term [80].

In this work, we seek to understand how different kinds of transparency about tracking, including the longitudinal transparency missing from current tools, affect users' perceptions. To conduct this evaluation, we developed a browser extension, **Tracking Transparency**, for displaying longitudinal tracking information. We created the extension’s user interface iteratively, informed by 13 interviews. The extension’s detailed visualizations aim to make tracking, especially its longitudinal aspects, comprehensible to users.

To populate the user interface and visualizations, **Tracking Transparency** locally stores logs of the pages the user visits and trackers encountered, detected via HTTP requests to known trackers. Further, the extension provides a personalized approximation of the inferences trackers may have made from this accumulated information. For example, a tracker present on a page about dogs and a page about football may infer that a user who visited both is interested in pets and sports. To generate this approximation, we apply the TF-IDF topic-modeling algorithm (selected after evaluating several topic-modeling options). Our method for simulating inferences operates client-side, limiting the information shared with the research team, and works without any cooperation from trackers themselves.

The ultimate goal of our work is to understand how visualizing longitudinal and inference-level information about online tracking impacts users’ knowledge, perceptions, and attitudes. To this end, the **Tracking Transparency** tool provides a platform to conduct studies on how users respond to personalized explanations of tracking using their own browsing history and plausible approximations of what companies could have learned about their interests. The source code for our extension is available on GitHub.1

We conducted a longitudinal field study in which 425 participants from Mechanical Turk installed our browser extension and used it for a week. We aimed to understand how particular types of transparency provided either by our tool’s visualizations or by visualizations approximating those of existing approaches impact users. Therefore, we randomly assigned each participant to use one of six variants. These variants represented the information currently provided by advertising networks (static explanations), state-of-the-art privacy tools like Ghostery and Lightbeam, and our fully featured **Tracking Transparency** interface. Participants completed surveys before and after using the extension.

One-third of participants who saw our fully featured interface were surprised by how trackers used their browsing history to infer their interests and that interests were even inferred in the first place. Most participants who saw any of the variants other than our control condition were surprised by the amount of tracking occurring. The fully featured interface increased participants’ self-reported intentions to take privacy-protective actions (e.g., using private browsing) significantly more than static explanations typical of advertising networks’ own disclosures, as well as slightly more than state-of-the-art, tracker-centric privacy tools. **Tracking Transparency** also helped participants more accurately characterize the tracking ecosystem, which they had significantly underestimated.

Currently, privacy tools and advertising networks themselves provide users only blurry snapshots of the online tracking and targeting ecosystem. **Tracking Transparency** gives richer visibility into the kinds of information that may be inferred. Furthermore, it does so client-side and without cooperation from tracking companies. It is a first step toward helping users recognize and better understand that trackers record what they browsed and make inferences from this knowledge. With improved understanding, users can make more informed privacy decisions and policy demands.

This work’s main contribution is to human-subjects research in proposing a new user interaction that presents online tracking through longitudinal and inference-level visualizations, as well as measuring how these visualizations impact users’ attitudes and intended behaviors. One key result from our field study is that these new types of visualizations led to increased intention to take privacy-protective actions, especially compared to the static text typical of advertising networks’ disclosures. A second key result is that these visualizations increased both participants’ knowledge of how inferences are inferred from browsing data and participants’ ability to quantify the extent of the tracking ecosystem.

## 2. Background and Related Work
We discuss mechanisms of online tracking, user perceptions of targeted ads, existing privacy tools, and topic modeling.

### 2.1 Online Tracking and Targeting
Since the first observed third-party web tracker in 1996 [53], the online ecosystem of third-party tracking has grown substantially in magnitude and complexity [102]. Web tracking is an “arms race” between trackers and tracker-blockers [8, 37, 41, 57, 63, 67, 77, 102]. A number of methods can be used for third-party tracking: cookies [28]; fingerprinting [1]; tracking pixels [78]; and more [27]. A growing body of work characterizes user perceptions of online tracking [30, 82, 95, 101]. Users have a wide variety of reactions to web tracking related to targeted ads. These reactions range from positive to negative [79, 90] and from comfortable to creepy [23, 58, 91]. Users often evince a tension between a desire to see relevant ads and their concerns about invasiveness [23, 91]. Further, studies disagree on when users are willing to share information with advertisers [25, 52] or pay for privacy [17, 26, 49]. Users also have generally negative opinions about, or ignore, online tracking disclosures, such as cookie disclaimers [46] and privacy notices [75, 103]. Nevertheless, most of these studies only provide snapshots into users’ perceptions of tracking. To our knowledge, how detailed personalized and longitudinal information might qualitatively change user perceptions has not previously been evaluated.

Algorithmic processes assign advertisements to users based on inferred profiles. People do not always understand the output of algorithms [29, 72] despite having many opinions about what should be done if algorithms are biased [31], imperfect [30], or discriminatory [5, 70]. Nonetheless, users can be surprisingly deferential to algorithmic inferences, such as by showing reluctance to make changes to automatically generated profiles [94] or even self-auditing to fit inferences made by an algorithm [86].

### 2.2 Privacy Tools and Transparency
Growing concern over online tracking has led to an influx of privacy tools. There are many anti-tracking browser extensions [27], and widely-used web browsers now feature cookie blocking and tracking prevention [44, 64, 98]. However, given the rapid evolution and pervasiveness of online tracking, technical privacy tools are unlikely to be the complete solution. Tools to block ads and tracking enjoy meaningful adoption, but users struggle to understand the information they present [56, 59, 80]. Further, with frequent changes in tracking techniques, blocking tracking is an arms race [27].

In this section, we review current privacy tools. In our field study, we compare representatives of the types described below. First, clicking the AdChoices icon that accompanies targeted ads [43] shows text explaining targeting broadly. Users find the icon itself confusing [51]. Furthermore, clicking the icon usually leads to a pop-over in which targeting is explained only in the abstract, without specific or concrete insight into why that ad was chosen. For example, “This ad has been matched to your interests. It was selected for you based on your browsing activity” (Figure 1a).

Second, advertising networks (e.g., Google [36], Facebook [32], and Oracle [65]) sometimes provide “privacy dashboards” displaying some of the inferences they have made. For example, Google’s Ad Settings (Figure 1b) lists some estimated interests and gives vague explanations of how they were chosen. These dashboards have been shown to be incomplete [89, 99], misleading [4], and potentially inaccurate [9, 21]. They have also been used to show discrimination in advertising [20] and targeting on sensitive topics [48, 99]. Our system greatly expands on this class of transparency (cf. Section 3.3) by simulating principled attribution of inferences.

Third, privacy-focused browser extensions like Ghostery (Figure 1c), Disconnect, and Privacy Badger show the trackers on the current page and allow users to block them. Mozilla’s Lightbeam displays connections between trackers and websites (Figure 1d) based on the user’s browsing history. Although these tools increase awareness of online tracking and privacy issues, users often fail to understand the full impact of tracking and targeting [80]. **Tracking Transparency** explains to users which inferences trackers could perhaps make about them based on longitudinal information.

Fourth, researchers have evaluated a variety of new techniques for expressing preferences about third-party tracking. For example, TrackMeOrNot gives users the ability to block trackers according to stated privacy preferences [60]. Usability studies of these tools generally find that it is difficult for users to make meaningful changes to their tracking preferences [7, 45, 50, 59].

Researchers have designed interfaces to explain privacy concepts like mobile app permissions [3], app data sharing [6, 92], and web privacy [84]. They have also documented abstract perceptions of online tracking [17, 46, 49, 52, 75, 91]. To our knowledge, no work has focused on explaining the longitudinal and inference-level aspects of web tracking, nor evaluating how such visualizations impact users’ attitudes and knowledge. We fill this gap.

### 2.3 Topic Modeling
The categorization of web pages and attribution of inferences has been approached from multiple angles. Resources like the Open Directory Project [71] have manually categorized many sites. Companies like SimilarWeb provide APIs that categorize sites using proprietary datasets and machine learning [81]. Statistical techniques have been used to attribute inferences in lab settings [7, 20, 48].

For the **Tracking Transparency** extension, we wanted to categorize arbitrary web pages in a client-side, privacy-preserving manner, which to our knowledge has not been directly explored in the literature. As such, we relied on prior work on topic generation and keyword extraction. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) [12] uses generative statistical models to group and model documents. The graph-based information retrieval algorithm TextRank [61] is used for keyword extraction, while PageRank [66] ranks the importance of words in texts. Wikipedia is effective at finding topic-related texts [34, 54], especially with graph-based algorithms [16, 100].

## 3. **Tracking Transparency** Extension
Our ultimate goal was to contribute an understanding of how longitudinal and inference-focused visualizations impact users’ attitudes and awareness about third-party web tracking. However, to our knowledge, no such longitudinal and inference-focused tools existed prior to this study. Thus, we developed the **Tracking Transparency** extension, which enables personalized visualizations about web tracking by collecting data about a user’s browsing client-side. Section 3.1 provides an overview of the user interface, which we refined through interviews (Section 3.2). Section 3.3 describes the topic modeling approach we use to simulate inferencing. Section 3.4 discusses data we collected on the sensitivity of interest categories.

The data the extension generates is stored in a client-side IndexedDB database. For all pages visited, it stores basic metadata (page title, URL, time), detected trackers, and the page’s inferred topic. The extension uses web workers to minimize resource usage. We are releasing our extension open-source to bootstrap further human-subjects research into the impact of visualizing tracking.

To detect trackers, we check all outgoing web resource requests to third-party domains against Disconnect’s list of known trackers [22]. Mozilla Firefox and DuckDuckGo’s privacy extension also use this list [24, 44]. We record a tracker as present for a page if there are any requests to that tracker’s domain. Most known types of tracking, including cookies and fingerprinting, generate requests our extension detects. This method lets us both detect trackers without pre-training and associate domains with entities (e.g., mapping both doubleclick.net and google-analytics.com to “Google”). Blacklist-based detection may not detect all potential trackers, but the Disconnect list is widely used and frequently updated.

### 3.1 Interface Components
**Tracking Transparency** provides a dashboard and accompanying interface components to present users with personalized examples of trackers in their online browsing. Note that in our field study (Section 4), some interface components were hidden in some study conditions for purposes of controlled comparison.

- **Toolbar Popup:** To access the extension, users first click the extension’s icon in the toolbar. This displays the popup (Figure 2), which summarizes tracking both on the current page and since installation. It also provides a link to the dashboard home page.
- **Home Page:** When users first open the dashboard, they see a home page with a static explanation defining trackers and interests (Figure 7 in the appendix). There are also summaries of the top trackers encountered, the top interests inferred, and general statistics about the number of pages visited. The dashboard also defines and explains key concepts like interests, trackers, and sites.
- **Interests Tab:** The Interests tab (Figure 3) presents simulated interests that trackers may have inferred about that user based on their browsing history. This page’s focal point is an interactive sunburst graphic that shows the frequency of interests inferred about them, organized into hierarchical categories. Users can apply filters to the sunburst, displaying interests by recency, popularity, and sensitivity. The popularity filter uses audience-size data scraped from the Google AdWords targeting interface. Sensitivity ratings were determined with a user study (Section 3.4). When a user selects an interest in the sunburst, a sidebar appears summarizing details about that inference. For example, Figure 3 shows an interest in “Home Improvement” may have been inferred on 1 site by 8 trackers.
- **Interest Detail Pages:** Interest Detail pages feature bar charts to illustrate the relevant site and tracker information (e.g., frequently visited sites where an interest in “Home Improvement” could have been inferred, as well as trackers that could have inferred that interest). A table lists all user-visited pages that our algorithm labeled “Home Improvement,” and a bar chart shows how often trackers inferred that interest over time.
- **Trackers Tab:** The Trackers tab (Figure 8 in the appendix) shows a summary of all observed tracking activity, as well as a bar chart showing how frequently each tracker was observed. As on the Interests tab, selecting a tracker displays a sidebar with summary statistics and basic information about the tracker. It also provides a link to the tracker’s detail page.
- **Tracker Detail Pages:** Each Tracker Detail page (Figure 10 in the appendix) gives a short description of the tracker and its privacy policy, drawn from Better [11]. A word cloud illustrates interests potentially inferred by the tracker, and a bar chart shows sites most frequently associated with the tracker. A table lists all associated page visits, and a bar chart quantifies tracking over time.
- **Activity & Sites Tabs:** The Activity tab (Figure 9 in the appendix) displays a heatmap of browsing activity and associated tracking for each hour over the past week. The Sites tab summarizes all sites visited, providing a detailed view of the user’s browsing history and the trackers encountered.

This comprehensive and interactive interface aims to provide users with a clear and actionable understanding of the tracking and inferencing activities that occur during their online browsing.
