ABSTRACT
Internet companies track users’ online activity to make inferences
about their interests, which are then used to target ads and per-
sonalize their web experience. Prior work has shown that existing
privacy-protective tools give users only a limited understanding and
incomplete picture of online tracking. We present Tracking Trans-
parency, a privacy-preserving browser extension that visualizes
examples of long-term, longitudinal information that third-party
trackers could have inferred from users’ browsing. The extension
uses a client-side topic modeling algorithm to categorize pages
that users visit and combines this with data about the web trackers
encountered over time to create these visualizations. We conduct
a longitudinal field study in which 425 participants use one of six
variants of our extension for a week. We find that, after using the ex-
tension, participants have more accurate perceptions of the extent
of tracking and also intend to take privacy-protecting actions.

link records of a user’s browsing activity across multiple web pages.
These records can be used to make inferences about the user’s de-
mographics and interests, enabling targeted advertising, in which
online ads are tailored for a particular user. Targeted advertising has
come under increasing scrutiny as a threat to privacy and a poten-
tial enabler of discrimination based on race, age, sexual orientation,
and other sensitive categories [5, 20, 39, 87].
Although targeted advertising is ubiquitous on the web and
has received substantial news coverage, prior work suggests many
people do not understand how they are tracked across websites, nor
how their interests are inferred [95]. Users have limited means to
learn about the extent and implications of third-party tracking and
personalization. Advertising networks provide general explanations
of ad targeting, and some companies show interests that have been
inferred (Figures 1a, 1b), though they have been shown to provide
incomplete and possibly misleading information [4, 89, 99]. User-
installed browser extensions (Figures 1c, 1d) highlight the trackers
on the web pages a user visits, but provide limited insight into
longitudinal tracking and do not explain what companies have
learned and inferred about users’ interests over the long term [80].
In this work, we seek to understand how different kinds of trans-
parency about tracking—including the longitudinal transparency
missing from current tools—affect users’ perceptions. To conduct
this evaluation, we developed a browser extension, Tracking Trans-
parency, for displaying longitudinal tracking information. We cre-
ated the extension’s user interface iteratively, informed by 13 inter-
views. The extension’s detailed visualizations aim to make tracking,
especially its longitudinal aspects, comprehensible to users.
To populate the user interface and visualizations, Tracking Trans-
parency locally stores logs of the pages the user visits and trackers
encountered, detected via HTTP requests to known trackers. Fur-
ther, the extension provides a personalized approximation of the
inferences trackers may have made from this accumulated informa-
tion. For example, a tracker present on a page about dogs and a page
about football may infer a user who visited both is interested in pets
and sports. To generate this approximation, we apply the TF-IDF
topic-modeling algorithm (selected after evaluating several topic-
modeling options). Our method for simulating inferences operates
client-side, limiting the information shared with the research team,
and works without any cooperation from trackers themselves.
The ultimate goal of our work is to understand how visualizing
longitudinal and inference-level information about online tracking
impacts users’ knowledge, perceptions, and attitudes. To this end,
the Tracking Transparency tool provides a platform to conduct

studies on how users respond to personalized explanations of track-
ing using their own browsing history and plausible approximations
of what companies could have learned about their interests. The
source code for our extension is available on GitHub.1
We conducted a longitudinal field study in which 425 participants
from Mechanical Turk installed our browser extension and used
it for a week. We aimed to understand how particular types of
transparency provided either by our tool’s visualizations or by
visualizations approximating those of existing approaches impact
users. Therefore, we randomly assigned each participant to use
one of six variants. These variants represented the information
currently provided by advertising networks (static explanations),
state-of-the-art privacy tools like Ghostery and Lightbeam, and
our fully featured Tracking Transparency interface. Participants
completed surveys before and after using the extension.
One-third of participants who saw our fully featured interface
were surprised by how trackers used their browsing history to infer
their interests, and that interests were even inferred in the first place.
Most participants who saw any of the variants other than our con-
trol condition were surprised by the amount of tracking occurring.
The fully featured interface increased participants’ self-reported
intentions to take privacy-protective actions (e.g., using private
browsing) significantly more than static explanations typical of
advertising networks’ own disclosures, as well as slightly more
than state-of-the-art, tracker-centric privacy tools. Tracking Trans-
parency also helped participants more accurately characterize the
tracking ecosystem, which they had significantly underestimated.
Currently, privacy tools and advertising networks themselves
provide users only blurry snapshots of the online tracking and tar-
geting ecosystem. Tracking Transparency gives richer visibility into
the kinds of information that may be inferred. Furthermore, it does
so client-side and without cooperation from tracking companies. It
is a first step toward helping users recognize and better understand
that trackers record what they browsed and make inferences from
this knowledge. With improved understanding, users can make
more informed privacy decisions and policy demands.
This work’s main contribution is to human-subjects research
in proposing a new user interaction that presents online tracking
through longitudinal and inference-level visualizations, as well as
measuring how these visualizations impact users’ attitudes and
intended behaviors. One key result from our field study is that
1https://github.com/UChicagoSUPERgroup/TrackingTransparencyCCS2019/
these new types of visualizations led to increased intention to take
privacy-protective actions, especially compared to the static text
typical of advertising networks’ disclosures. A second key result is
that these visualizations increased both participants’ knowledge of
how inferences are inferred from browsing data and participants’
ability to quantify the extent of the tracking ecosystem.
2 BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK
We discuss mechanisms of online tracking, user perceptions of
targeted ads, existing privacy tools, and topic modeling.
2.1 Online Tracking and Targeting
Since the first observed third-party web tracker in 1996 [53], the
online ecosystem of third-party tracking has grown substantially
in magnitude and complexity [102]. Web tracking is an “arms race”
between trackers and tracker-blockers [8, 37, 41, 57, 63, 67, 77,
102]. A number of methods can be used for third-party tracking:
cookies [28]; fingerprinting [1]; tracking pixels [78]; and more [27].
A growing body of work characterizes user perceptions of online
tracking [30, 82, 95, 101]. Users have a wide variety of reactions to
web tracking related to targeted ads. These reactions range from pos-
itive to negative [79, 90] and from comfortable to creepy [23, 58, 91].
Users often evince a tension between a desire to see relevant ads
and their concerns about invasiveness [23, 91]. Further, studies
disagree on when users are willing to share information with ad-
vertisers [25, 52] or pay for privacy [17, 26, 49]. Users also have
generally negative opinions about, or ignore, online tracking disclo-
sures, such as cookie disclaimers [46] and privacy notices [75, 103].
Nevertheless, most of these studies only provide snapshots into
users’ perceptions of tracking. To our knowledge, how detailed per-
sonalized and longitudinal information might qualitatively change
user perceptions has not previously been evaluated.
Algorithmic processes assign advertisements to users based on
inferred profiles. People do not always understand the output of al-
gorithms [29, 72] despite having many opinions about what should
be done if algorithms are biased [31], imperfect [30], or discrim-
inatory [5, 70]. Nonetheless, users can be surprisingly deferen-
tial to algorithmic inferences, such as by showing reluctance to
make changes to automatically generated profiles [94] or even self-
auditing to fit inferences made by an algorithm [86].
2.2 Privacy Tools and Transparency
Growing concern over online tracking has led to an influx of pri-
vacy tools. There are many anti-tracking browser extensions [27],
and widely-used web browsers now feature cookie blocking and
tracking prevention [44, 64, 98]. However, given the rapid evolution
and pervasiveness of online tracking, technical privacy tools are
unlikely to be the complete solution. Tools to block ads and tracking
enjoy meaningful adoption, but users struggle to understand the in-
formation they present [56, 59, 80]. Further, with frequent changes
in tracking techniques, blocking tracking is an arms race [27].
In this section, we review current privacy tools. In our field study,
we compare representatives of the types described below. First,
clicking the AdChoices icon that accompanies targeted ads [43]
shows text explaining targeting broadly. Users find the icon itself
confusing [51]. Furthermore, clicking the icon usually leads to
a pop-over in which targeting is explained only in the abstract,
without specific or concrete insight into why that ad was chosen.
For example, “This ad has been matched to your interests. It was
selected for you based on your browsing activity’ ’ (Figure 1a).
Second, advertising networks (e.g., Google [36], Facebook [32],
and Oracle [65]) sometimes provide “privacy dashboards” display-
ing some of the inferences they have made. For example, Google’s
Ad Settings (Figure 1b) lists some estimated interests and gives
vague explanations of how they were chosen. These dashboards
have been shown to be incomplete [89, 99], misleading [4], and
potentially inaccurate [9, 21]. They have also been used to show
discrimination in advertising [20] and targeting on sensitive top-
ics [48, 99]. Our system greatly expands on this class of transparency
(cf. Section 3.3) by simulating principled attribution of inferences.
Third, privacy-focused browser extensions like Ghostery (Fig-
ure 1c), Disconnect, and Privacy Badger show the trackers on the
current page. They also allow users to block them. Mozilla’s Light-
beam displays connections between trackers and websites (Fig-
ure 1d) based on the user’s browsing history. Although these tools
increase awareness of online tracking and privacy issues, users of-
ten fail to understand the full impact of tracking and targeting [80].
Tracking Transparency explains to users which inferences trackers
could perhaps make about them based on longitudinal information.
Fourth, researchers have evaluated a variety of new techniques
for expressing preferences about third-party tracking. For example,
TrackMeOrNot gives users the ability to block trackers according to
stated privacy preferences [60]. Usability studies of these tools gen-
erally find that it is difficult for users to make meaningful changes
to their tracking preferences [7, 45, 50, 59].
Researchers have designed interfaces to explain privacy concepts
like mobile app permissions [3], app data sharing [6, 92], and web
privacy [84]. They have also documented abstract perceptions of on-
line tracking [17, 46, 49, 52, 75, 91]. To our knowledge, no work has
focused on explaining the longitudinal and inference-level aspects
of web tracking, nor evaluating how such visualizations impact
users’ attitudes and knowledge. We fill this gap.
2.3 Topic Modeling
The categorization of web pages and attribution of inferences has
been approached from multiple angles. Resources like the Open
Directory Project [71] have manually categorized many sites. Com-
panies like SimilarWeb provide APIs that categorize sites using pro-
prietary datasets and machine learning [81]. Statistical techniques
have been used to attribute inferences in lab settings [7, 20, 48].
For the Tracking Transparency extension, we wanted to catego-
rize arbitrary web pages in a client-side, privacy-preserving manner,
which to our knowledge has not been directly explored in the lit-
erature. As such, we relied on prior work on topic generation and
keyword extraction. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) [12] uses
generative statistical models to group and model documents. The
graph-based information retrieval algorithm TextRank [61] is used
for keyword extraction, while PageRank [66] ranks the importance
of words in texts. Wikipedia is effective at finding topic-related
texts [34, 54], especially with graph-based algorithms [16, 100].
3 TRACKING TRANSPARENCY EXTENSION
Our ultimate goal was to contribute an understanding of how lon-
gitudinal and inference-focused visualizations impact users’ atti-
tudes and awareness about third-party web tracking. However, to
our knowledge, no such longitudinal and inference-focused tools
existed prior to this study. Thus, we developed the Tracking Trans-
parency extension, which enables personalized visualizations about
web tracking by collecting data about a user’s browsing client-side.
Section 3.1 provides an overview of the user interface, which we
refined through interviews (Section 3.2). Section 3.3 describes the
topic modeling approach we use to simulate inferencing. Section 3.4
discusses data we collected on the sensitivity of interest categories.
The data the extension generates is stored in a client-side In-
dexedDB database. For all pages visited, it stores basic metadata
(page title, URL, time), detected trackers, and the page’s inferred
topic. The extension uses web workers to minimize resource usage.
We are releasing our extension open-source to bootstrap further
human-subjects research into the impact of visualizing tracking.
To detect trackers, we check all outgoing web resource requests
to third-party domains against Disconnect’s list of known track-
ers [22]. Mozilla Firefox and DuckDuckGo’s privacy extension also
use this list [24, 44]. We record a tracker as present for a page if
there are any requests to that tracker’s domain. Most known types
of tracking, including cookies and fingerprinting, generate requests
our extension detects. This method lets us both detect trackers with-
out pre-training and associate domains with entities (e.g., mapping
both doubleclick.net and google-analytics.com to “Google”).
Blacklist-based detection may not detect all potential trackers, but
the Disconnect list is widely used and frequently updated.
3.1 Interface Components
Tracking Transparency provides a dashboard and accompanying
interface components to present users with personalized examples
of trackers in their online browsing. Note that in our field study
(Section 4), some interface components were hidden in some study
conditions for purposes of controlled comparison.
Toolbar popup. To access the extension, users first click the ex-
tension’s icon in the toolbar. This displays the popup (Figure 2),
which summarizes tracking both on the current page and since
installation. It also provides a link to the dashboard home page.
Figure 2: Browser open to a web page with popup visible.
Home page. When users first open the dashboard, they see a
home page with a static explanation defining trackers and inter-
ests (Figure 7 in the appendix). There are also summaries of the
top trackers encountered, the top interests inferred, and general
statistics about the number of pages visited. The dashboard also
defines and explains key concepts like interests, trackers, and sites.
Interests tab. The Interests tab (Figure 3) presents simulated inter-
ests that trackers may have inferred about that user based on their
browsing history. This page’s focal point is an interactive sunburst
graphic that shows the frequency of interests inferred about them,
organized into hierarchical categories. Users can apply filters to
the sunburst, displaying interests by recency, popularity, and sensi-
tivity. The popularity filter uses audience-size data scraped from
the Google AdWords targeting interface. Sensitivity ratings were
determined with a user study (Section 3.4). When a user selects
an interest in the sunburst, a sidebar appears summarizing details
about that inference. For example, Figure 3 shows an interest in
“Home Improvement” may have been inferred on 1 site by 8 trackers.
Interest detail pages. Interest Detail pages feature bar charts to
illustrate the relevant site and tracker information (e.g., frequently
visited sites where an interest in “Home Improvement” could have
been inferred, as well as trackers that could have inferred that
interest). A table lists all user-visited pages that our algorithm
labeled “Home Improvement,” and a bar chart shows how often
trackers inferred that interest over time.
Trackers tab. The Trackers tab (Figure 8 in the appendix) shows
a summary of all observed tracking activity, as well as a bar chart
showing how frequently each tracker was observed. As on the
Interests tab, selecting a tracker displays a sidebar with summary
statistics and basic information about the tracker. It also provides a
link to the tracker’s detail page.
Tracker detail pages. Each Tracker Detail page (Figure 10 in the
appendix) gives a short description of the tracker and its privacy
policy, drawn from Better [11]. A word cloud illustrates interests
potentially inferred by the tracker, and a bar chart shows sites most
frequently associated with the tracker. A table lists all associated
page visits, and a bar chart quantifies tracking over time.
Activity & sites tabs. The Activity tab (Figure 9 in the appendix)
displays a heatmap of browsing activity and associated tracking for
each hour over the past week. The Sites tab summarizes all sites
