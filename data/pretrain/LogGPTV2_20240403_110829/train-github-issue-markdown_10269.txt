Mac OS X version 10.10.2 (14C109)  
Atom Version 0.186.0 (0.186.0)
Standard OS X behavior (e.g. Mail.app) is:
  * option+left/right arrow moves by one word
  * control+left/right arrow moves to beginning/end of line
(For reference, in Sublime Text, both those options move by one word, which I
happen to prefer.)
In current versions of Atom, the cursor does not move at all with these key
combinations.
(I don't have any custom bindings for these keys in my keymap.cson)
