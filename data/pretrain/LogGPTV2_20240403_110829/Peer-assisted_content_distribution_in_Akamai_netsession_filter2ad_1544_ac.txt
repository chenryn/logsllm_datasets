### Peer Behavior and Bandwidth Contribution

Peers in the system do not proactively download content; they only share objects that the corresponding user has previously downloaded. Uploads are rate-limited, and each object is uploaded a limited number of times. Additionally, peers monitor the utilization of local network connections and throttle or pause uploads when the connections are being used by other applications. While good download performance is essential for users, upload performance is intentionally limited using custom protocols.

Users do not directly benefit from the bandwidth they donate, but NetSession offers several indirect benefits. For example, the Download Manager (DLM) allows users to resume interrupted downloads and to download from multiple sources simultaneously. Peer-assisted downloads also require fewer resources from the infrastructure, enabling content providers to offer services at a lower cost, which can be passed on to users.

### Measurement Study

To evaluate how well NetSession, as an instance of a peer-assisted Content Delivery Network (CDN), delivers the potential benefits of a hybrid architecture and mitigates associated risks, we conducted a measurement study based on logs from the production system.

#### 4.1 Data Set

Our logs cover the month of October 2012 and include information about downloads and logins. When a peer downloads a file from NetSession, the control node (CN) records details such as the GUID of the peer, the file name and size, the CP code (identifying the content provider's account), the start and end times of the download, and the number of bytes downloaded from the infrastructure and from peers. This information is used for accounting and billing. Additionally, when a peer connects to the control plane, the CN records the peer's current IP address, software version, and whether uploads are enabled.

To geographically localize peers, we used Akamai’s EdgeScape service to obtain geolocation data for each IP address in the trace. This data includes an ISO 3166 country code, city and state names, latitude/longitude coordinates, timezone, and network provider name. The granularity of location information varies by region, with locations typically at the city/suburb level in the United States. For privacy, the data in our logs have been anonymized by hashing file names, IP addresses, and GUIDs.

#### 4.2 Number and Location of Peers

As of October 2012, the one-month trace contained approximately 26 million distinct GUIDs. On a typical day, between 8.75 and 10.90 million GUIDs connected to the control plane at least once. The system has grown steadily over time; for comparison, a trace from October 2012 had 14.19 million distinct GUIDs, slightly more than half the number in our trace.

Figure 2 shows the global distribution of peers as a "bubble plot," where the size of each bubble corresponds to the number of peers whose first connection was from that location. Most peers are located in North America (27%) and Europe (35%), with significant numbers in South America and Asia. We observed connections from 239 different countries and territories across all continents, indicating that NetSession is a truly global system.

#### 4.3 Content Providers

Each file available through NetSession is offered by a specific content provider, typically a large corporate customer. To illustrate usage, we selected the ten largest customers (identified as Customers A through J), associated each download with one of ten regions, and counted the number of downloads per customer per region. Table 2 shows the results. Generally, about half of the downloads occur in Europe, but the distribution varies by customer. For example, Customer B's content is more popular in Asia (excluding China) and Africa, while Customer J's content is primarily requested from within the United States.

#### 4.4 Available Content

At the time of data collection, NetSession was primarily used for distributing software installers, with data files, music, and video making up a smaller portion. Overall, we observed downloads for 4,038,894 distinct objects in our trace. Figure 3(a) shows the distribution of requests for objects of a given size, for peer-assisted, infrastructure-only, and all requests in NetSession. Peer-assisted downloads are strongly biased towards large files, with 82% of requests being for objects larger than 500 MB. Since the benefits of peer assist are most pronounced for large objects, content providers tend to enable it for such files.

Figures 3(b) and (c) show the object popularity distribution and temporal request patterns, respectively. As expected, the former follows a power law, while the latter shows typical diurnal patterns.

### Benefits

Next, we focus on three key questions that can be quantitatively answered based on our data:
1. How well does peer assist work?
2. Does peer assist affect performance and reliability?
3. Does peer assist help improve the CDN’s global coverage?

#### 5.1 How Well Does Peer Assist Work?

NetSession peers are not required to contribute bandwidth; users can disable uploads via the NetSession GUI. This differs from pure peer-to-peer systems like BitTorrent, which use incentive mechanisms like tit-for-tat to encourage uploading. In the literature, it is often assumed that users will avoid uploading if they do not benefit from it. Therefore, it is natural to ask whether NetSession peers are willing to contribute any bandwidth at all.

To answer this question, we used login records to determine the fraction of peers with uploads enabled. The NetSession binary is available in two versions: one with uploads initially enabled and one with uploads initially disabled. This is chosen by the content provider who bundles the binary. Some content providers use the software merely as a download manager without the peer assist feature. We also checked whether users changed this setting between logins and, if so, how often.

Tables 3 and 4 show our results. Approximately 31% of peers have uploading enabled, but the setting is rarely changed—more than 99% of peers keep their initial setting throughout our trace. The initial setting depends on the content provider.
