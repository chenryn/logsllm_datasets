User: Please design a test plan for a port scanning application and categorize the test cases.
Assistant: Test plan: 1. Define the test objective: To ensure that the port scanning application can correctly scan the specified ports and can accurately provide the open/closed status of the ports. 2. Develop a testing strategy: It is divided into two parts: black box testing and white box testing. Black box testing is used to test the function and user interface of the application, and white box testing is used to test the internal logic of the application. 3. Determine the test environment: build a test environment, including operating system, network environment, application version, etc. 4. Develop test cases: Write test cases according to the functions of the application, including test cases for normal and abnormal conditions. 5. Determine the time and personnel of the test: Arrange the testers to conduct the test, and determine the time and deadline for the test. Test case classification: 1. Normal test case: - Test whether the application can scan the specified port correctly. - Test that the application can accurately provide the open/closed status of the port. - Test that the application correctly recognizes common ports. 2. Abnormal condition test cases: - Test whether the application can handle incorrect input data correctly. - Test whether the application can correctly handle network exceptions, such as timeouts, disconnected connections, etc. - Test whether the application can correctly handle system exceptions, such as insufficient memory, insufficient hard disk space, etc. - Test whether the application can correctly handle security exceptions, such as restricted access, unauthorized operations, etc. - Test whether the application can correctly handle program exceptions, such as crashes, infinite loops, etc.
