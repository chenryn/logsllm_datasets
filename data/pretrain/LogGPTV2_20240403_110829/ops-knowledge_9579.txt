User: Please provide a container-based continuous delivery solution, including detailed instructions on the selection of containerized platforms, automated construction, testing, and deployment.
Assistant: Container-based continuous delivery solution: 1. Choose a containerization platform: Kubernetes is recommended as the containerization platform, because it is currently one of the most widely used container orchestration platforms, with good community support and a rich plug-in ecosystem. 2. Automated build: Use continuous integration tools, such as Jenkins or GitLab CI, to automatically build the Docker image after the code is submitted. 3. Testing: Execute tests in Docker images, such as using Selenium for UI testing, or integrating unit testing frameworks for automated testing. 4. Image processing: Upload the Docker image that passes the test to a mirror warehouse, such as Docker Hub or Harbor. 5. Deployment: Deploy using Kubernetes. Deploy different application components in separate containers and then use Kubernetes to orchestrate them to ensure they work together seamlessly across the cluster. 6. Continuous delivery: Automating the entire process can ensure that the software is always in a deliverable state, and there are strategies that can help achieve trouble-free grayscale releases and rollbacks. For example, Kubernetes' deployment controllers can be used to ensure that no exceptions occur when switching from one version to another. This solution can help teams deliver new features quickly, with high reliability and portability.
