Impact to Telecommunication Loss 
Impact of Telecommunication Loss 
•
Loss of Life 
•
Limits Response by Emergency Services 
•
Disruption of organized events 
•
Economic Loss 
We need a method of creating an alternate method of 
communicating with each other. 
“People could not communicate. It got to the point that people were literally 
writing messages on paper, putting them in bottles and dropping them from 
helicopters to other people on the ground.” 
Louisiana Sen. Robert Barham (R)

Telecommunication Loss 
Loss of Communication for Different Reasons 
Natural Disasters 
•
Wipes out telecommunication infrastructures 
•
Require days to months to re-establish 
Government Suppression 
•
Infrastructure remains intact 
•
“Flip the Switch” and it is restored 
− Historically, down for only a few days

Human Impact of Katrina 
Communication breakdown caused deaths 
“With communications breakdowns critical information could 
not be transmitted. The levees broke and no one other than local residents 
knew about the massive flooding for several hours. Victims could not 
communicate with possible responders which increased the lack of 
response and devastation…  Lack of communications at all levels increased the 
chaos, deaths and destruction in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.”

Ad Hoc Technology 
Mesh Network 
Data Dissemination: 
•
Each node acts as a relay 
•
Captures and disseminates data 
Two Types: 
•
Flooding Relay 
•
Routing Relay 
Interesting Examples: 
•
Mobile ad hoc network (MANET) 
•
Vehicular ad hoc network (VANET)

Purpose of Ad Hoc Technology 
During a Revolution / Natural Disaster 
Information Dissemination: 
•
Revolution activities 
•
Evacuation notices 
•
Weather alerts 
•
Decrease misinformation and fear 
Emergency Services: 
•
Fire / Police / Ambulance 
•
Hospital locations and closures 
Communication with relatives: 
•
Rally points 
•
Reassurance

Potential Ad Hoc Nodes 
Cellular Smart Phones 
(Assuming no cellular network) 
Advantages: 
•
Ubiquitous / Accepted technology 
•
Low power consumption 
•
Very portable 
•
Flexible 
− Apps, data storage, accessories 
Disadvantages: 
•
Limited range 
•
Requires pre-existing software to be installed

Disaster Response 
Need to have combination 
•
Cellular phone services are very vulnerable to disruption 
•
Power outages impact most responses 
•
Portability is critical due to shifting circumstances 
•
Security – need both secure and non-secure 
•
Interoperability

Today’s Focus – Smart Phones 
Potential Ad Hoc Networks 
Mobile ad hoc network (MANET): 
•
Works with current Internet technology 
•
Longer ranges 
•
Requires phone be capable of relaying data 
•
Consumes power rapidly 
Bluetooth ad hoc network: 
•
Low power requirements 
•
Short ranges

MANET vs. Bluetooth 
Which to choose? 
Mobile ad hoc network (MANET): 
•
Internet connectivity is the goal 
•
Useful when power is not an issue 
Bluetooth ad hoc network: 
•
Preferred when power is an issue 
•
Data stays local – easier to disseminate information to a specific region
