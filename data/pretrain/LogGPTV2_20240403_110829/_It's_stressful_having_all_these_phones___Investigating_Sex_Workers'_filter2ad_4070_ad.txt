### Vetting and Information Verification

Sex workers often utilize their personal networks to verify information provided by clients, such as names or phone numbers, by checking with friends or in private online forums. This process helps them determine if a client has a negative reputation among other sex workers or has been reported for violent behavior. These forums may contain reports of negative experiences, partially or fully obscured phone numbers, and physical descriptions of problematic clients, similar to the "Bad Client and Aggressor List" described by Strohmayer et al. [67].

One participant mentioned the National Ugly Mugs (NUM), a centralized digital service in the U.K. that allows sex workers to report and search for clients [55]. However, this participant expressed frustration that the service is limited to the U.K. In Germany and Switzerland, no such centralized service exists, and several participants noted that the lack of such a service makes it difficult to vet clients effectively.

Participants also reported that even when vetting networks and platforms are available, they often face issues such as incomplete or inconsistently formatted data, which complicates the search process.

### Challenges in Vetting

The effectiveness of vetting depends on the accuracy of the information provided by the client before meeting. Some participants observed that clients' willingness to share information varies, particularly in jurisdictions where buying sex is illegal. The fear of being caught can lead clients to withhold or provide false information. P2 described the challenges of vetting clients through shared online databases:

"It’s always dependent on the information I’m provided. If I don’t get anything, then I can’t search for anything. The problem is that there’s no standardized database. It would be better if there were a centralized system with consistent standards. A major issue with these forums is that phone numbers are never consistently entered." (P2)

### Screening and Client Management

In addition to verifying past behavior, some sex workers use screening processes to "separate the wheat from the chaff" (P20). This type of vetting, which was also reported by Moorman et al. [54], is often developed over time through trial and error. It helps protect their time and ensures they find respectful clients. P6 explained how this process filters out clients who might push boundaries:

"I optimized my contact method over the years to find a system that weeds out unsuitable clients. By making it high maintenance to contact me, I ensure that those who follow my protocol really want to book me. In my experience, if someone is willing to overcome high obstacles, they are more likely to follow my other rules later." (P6)

Participants also frequently use blocking features on platforms like WhatsApp, advertising sites, and for phone calls and SMS when clients or potential clients are rude or pushy.

### Managing Digital Identities

Privacy is a critical safety goal for many sex workers, essential for maintaining boundaries and protecting physical safety, such as from stalking. Their efforts focus on ensuring that their work-related digital identities cannot be linked to their legal identity or personal contact information.

Many participants use aliases while working, and 77% of survey respondents reported using a fake name or concealing personal information from clients. One worker even developed a service to help sex workers avoid using their real names and addresses while complying with German website imprint requirements: "I helped develop a service where sex workers can use the official union address for their websites to secure their privacy" (P6).

Some sex workers are "out" about their profession in their personal lives, but this is not a binary state. For example, P3, who considers themselves out, still keeps their real name and address off Facebook because their father, who works for the church, does not know about their profession.

### Alternative Privacy Strategies

As an alternative to providing false information, some workers share details that are close to accurate but still protect their privacy. P19 explained how this can be a marketing strategy:

"It’s also a marketing strategy. Many clients are interested in the person behind the dominatrix, so I give them something to ‘chew on.’" (P19)

Many participants maintain multiple digital profiles, one for work and one for personal use, and try to keep them separate through different accounts or devices (66% of survey respondents). P21 described the challenges of maintaining separate devices:

"For a long time, I had another phone with a different number and WhatsApp, but it became too much work. I was slow to respond to clients, so I found it easier to have just one number." (P21)

### Self-Censorship and Data Minimization

To avoid the risks of digital identities merging, some participants go beyond maintaining separate profiles to minimize the amount of information they have online. P13, for example, keeps their personal Facebook profile extremely limited: "I don’t have photos, city, school, or university listed."

For work accounts, participants carefully curate photos to ensure their faces or identifying features like tattoos are not visible (46% of survey respondents). Some participants also remove content from their phones before crossing borders to avoid deportation. P18 described their practice:

"I delete my whole work phone, everything incriminating on my computer, and take down my website and apps. If they search my stuff at the border, I don’t want it to lead to deportation." (P18)

However, some participants stop using such measures due to the inconvenience. P16 decided to stop blurring their face in photos:

"I used to blur my face, but I stopped. It made me less safe, but I was tired of photoshopping and felt safer at the time. Clients connect strongly with faces, so it’s a good marketing move." (P16)

### Security and Privacy Settings

Few participants rely on privacy and security settings within their devices or online accounts. Only 35% of survey respondents reported changing settings to enhance privacy or security. P18 explained how they changed their Facebook privacy settings:

"I used to get a lot of ‘Do you know this person’ about clients, even though we never interacted on Facebook. I had to make everything private." (P18)

Some participants doubt the effectiveness of these settings. P21 prefers physical solutions like removing a phone from the room:

"I don’t trust the system. It doesn’t matter if you turn settings on or off; the phone will still listen and collect information." (P21)

### Security-Focused Tools

Few participants use specialized security tools. In the survey, only a small percentage reported using encrypted messaging apps like WhatsApp or Signal (32%), VPNs (14%), encrypted email (9%), Tor (9%), password managers (8%), or cryptocurrency (5%). P21 described the difficulty of using encrypted email:

"I have a friend who only writes encrypted emails, but it’s very effortful. They had to download an extra program for me, and it was too complicated." (P21)

Security tools can also interfere with business operations. P16 stopped using a VPN because it created new privacy risks and hindered their work:

"Many VPNs sell your data, and some advertising platforms require a local IP address. One U.K. platform requires a local phone number and access from an IP within the country." (P16)

Even if a sex worker is skilled enough to use a security tool, their clients may lack the necessary digital skills or interest. S49 highlighted this issue:

"I would gladly use all these tools, but they only work if the customers participate: Threema, Signal, Telegram, PGP-encryption, cryptocurrency." (S49)

### Resignation and Regret

Some participants express resignation or apathy about safety, feeling there is little they can do to be "100% safe at this job" (S15). P25 commented on the futility of some safety practices:

"How safe are you, really? With Google and Facebook, it’s not hard to find someone. It depends on what you’re trying to achieve." (P25)
