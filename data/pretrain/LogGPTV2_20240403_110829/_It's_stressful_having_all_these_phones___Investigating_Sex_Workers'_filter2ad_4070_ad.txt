use their networks to check information from the client (for
example, name or phone number) with friends or in private
online forums, in order to see whether a client has a bad
reputation among other sex workers or had been reported for
being violent. These forums might contain others’ reports
of negative experiences, complete or partly obscured phone
numbers, or physical descriptions of bad clients, similar to
the Bad Client and Aggressor List described by Strohmayer
et al. [67].
One participant mentioned the National Ugly Mugs, which
maintains a large, centralized digital services for reporting
and searching clients in the U.K. [55], but expressed frustra-
tion that the service only covered the U.K. In Germany and
Switzerland, our participants did not mention such a central-
ized service, and several complained that the lack of such a
service made vetting clients difﬁcult.
Participants reported that vetting networks and platforms —
centralized or otherwise — were not without issues, such as
incompleteness or inconsistent formatting of data that makes
search difﬁcult.

Vetting also depends on the ability of the worker to get
accurate information about the client before meeting them.
Some participants reported that clients’ willingness to share
information depended on buying sex being legal, as fear of
being caught would lead them to hide their information. P2
described facing several such challenges when vetting clients
through shared online databases:
“It’s always dependent on what information I’m
provided with. . . If I don’t get anything, then I can’t
search for anything. . . . The problem with that is
that there’s really no databank. There isn’t anything
standardized. [It] would just be better, if it would
run centrally. And that there would be standards. A
main problem with those forums is that the phone
numbers are never consistently entered.” (P2)
In the second form of vetting, the screening process is
less about checking for previous bad behavior, and instead
intended to “separate the wheat from the chaff” (P20). This
type of vetting was also reported by Moorman et al. [54]. This
was often a strategy developed over time and through trial-
and-error, and might be beneﬁcial in both protecting their time
and ﬁnding respectful clients. P6 described how this process
also helps ﬁlter out clients who might push other boundaries
as well:
“I optimized my contact method over the years to
ﬁnd a system that provides me with a way to weed
out idiots. Making it quite high maintenance to con-
tact me — [by making them contact me] in a very
particular way — makes it easier to make sure that
those who follow my protocol really want to book
me. . . . In my experience, if I have high obstacles
and people are willing to take them, I can expect
them to also follow my [other] rules later.” (P6)
With both forms of vetting, participants said they used
blocking features liberally when clients or potential clients
were rude or pushy with their boundaries, e.g., within Whats-
App, on advertising platforms, or for phone calls and SMS.
Managing digital identities. Privacy is a critical safety
goal for many sex workers, and also a goal that helps to fa-
cilitate other safety goals including maintaining boundaries
and protecting physical safety, for example from stalking. Sex
workers’ efforts around digital privacy and security largely
focused on ensuring that the digital identities used for work
could not be connected back to their legal identity or contact
information and ensuring separation between different digital
identities.
To protect their identities, many participants described us-
ing an alias while doing sex work, and 77% of our survey
respondents reported using a fake name or otherwise conceal-
ing information about themselves from clients. One worker
even developed a service that would allow them, and other
workers, to avoid using their real name and address while
satisfying German website imprint requirements: “I helped
to develop and offer a service where sex workers can use the
ofﬁcial union address as their address for their websites to
secure their privacy” (P6). This is one example of how having
access to a community, in this case a workers’ union, helps
promote safety.
Some sex workers are “out,” or public about being a sex
worker in their personal lives. However, being out is not a
binary; multiple participants who considered themselves “out”
still had family members who did not know, or social contexts
in which they did not want to be known as a sex worker. For
example, P3 said they don’t worry about sex work advertising
sites collecting personal information, but at the same time
they are careful about keeping some personal information off
of other platforms:
“I try to keep my real name out from Facebook. My
dad is on FB and he doesn’t know what I do. My
address, where my boyfriend lives. He works for
the church. That is not allowed to come out. . . My
[website] imprint is through a third party.” (P3)
P14 also explained how being out does not necessarily
mean that clients know their personal information: “It’s ac-
tually strange, because I’m ‘out’ privately, but none of my
clients know my real name or my address.”
As an alternative to providing false information, or not
providing information at all, some workers provide details
that have an element of truth but still protect their privacy. For
example, P19 described how sharing information that’s close
to accurate but still vague helps their business by making
clients feel special or trusted:
“It’s also a marketing strategy. A lot of guests are
also interested in the person behind the dominatrix,
so I give them something to ‘chew on.’ ” (P19)
Finally, many participants protect their privacy by main-
taining multiple digital proﬁles (one or more for work and
one for personal use) and attempting to keep those proﬁles
separate through the use of separate accounts or even devices
(66% of survey respondents):
“I had only one mobile for a long time, but then
[I got another one]. . . . You give your number to
people, and at one point they come up with the
clever idea to google the number, so they can see
immediately what you do for a living. . . . And I
started to work a lot with WhatsApp statuses. And
then there is the problem that if you want to post
a WhatsApp status for work, you want maybe a
picture that is a little bit more suggestive. And it
is not so good if your private circle of friends sees
that, because not everybody knows what you are
doing.” (P21)
384    30th USENIX Security Symposium

While keeping separate devices was common, it is also
burdensome, and not all participants chose to do it over the
long term:
“For a long time I had another phone with a dif-
ferent number and different WhatsApp but then I
noticed that it was just too much work for me, sepa-
rating them. And then I was also really slow to get
back to [clients]. Then that went under and I just
found it easier to just have one number.” (P12)
P18 describes the cost of keeping separate identities:
“I mean obviously I wish that sex work wasn’t con-
sidered shameful and I could post to my heart’s
delight. It’s also time consuming and it’s annoying,
stressful. It’s like even though my family knows, I
know it would be embarrassing to them if I came
out as a sex worker, for them to have to explain
that to their friends. That’s bullshit, but it’s true. It’s
stressful having all these phones and personas and
things I have to remember. I’m like, ‘Shit, did I
miss that when I put this up?’ All the time.” (P18)
Beyond ﬁnding it difﬁcult or not worth their time, partici-
pants also mentioned that ﬁnancial incentives might motivate
them to make exceptions to otherwise keeping their digital ac-
counts or devices separate. For example, P1 described a client
who found their personal social media account, an action for
which they would normally block a client. However, for one
particular client, they said: “He added me [on social media]
after he spent [a lot of money] in a 3 days row :D can’t really
be mad at him :DDD”
Self-censorship. While our participants sometimes had
considered reasons for relaxing or changing their rules around
keeping separate identities, the consequences of digital identi-
ties merging or linking back to participants’ personal lives or
information can be signiﬁcant. In order to avoid this, some of
our participants went beyond maintaining separate proﬁles, or
using false names, to minimizing the amount of information
they have online at all.
Out of fear that clients will ﬁnd their personal Facebook pro-
ﬁle or be recommended to them through PYMK, P13 decided
to keep their information on the proﬁle extremely limited: “I
don’t have photos. I don’t have my city or school or uni.”
Keeping photos off of work accounts is more difﬁcult, as
the photos are used to advertise. For these accounts, our par-
ticipants protected their identities by carefully curating photos
so that their face or identifying features like tattoos were not
visible (46% of survey respondents).
Participants also mentioned removing content from their
phones before crossing borders, for fear of being searched
and deported. P18 went as far as to completely shut down
their online accounts when traveling:
“I delete my whole work phone, everything incrim-
inating on my computer. I take down my website, I
take down all my apps. . . . If they feel suspicious for
some reason as I’m crossing and they search all my
stuff I don’t want that to lead to getting deported.”
(P18)
This practice was mentioned even by those working legally:
“I am legally allowed to work in most countries
where I work. [However,] I am scared of getting
banned from certain countries just for being a sex
worker so I remove all my info, account and website
and wipe my phone before travelling.” (S11)
However, as with keeping separate devices, some partic-
ipants stopped using such measures because they were too
cumbersome or felt ineffective. P16 describes the decision to
no longer hide their face in photos:
“I used to always blur out my face, which I don’t
do anymore. That was a conscious decision that I
knew would make me less safe. . . . I was tired of
doing a lot of photoshopping, and partly because I
felt a little bit safer in my work at the time, which
I don’t know if I do anymore, but. . . you can’t take
back. And clients connect very strongly with faces,
so it’s a good marketing move.” (P16)
Managing security & privacy settings. Few interview par-
ticipants depended on privacy and security settings within
their devices or online accounts to stay safe online. This was
reﬂected in the survey, where only 35% of respondents re-
ported changing security and privacy settings to be more
private or secure.
Of interview participants who did discuss modifying set-
tings, the two most commonly mentioned settings were visi-
bility settings on Facebook and location settings on mobile
devices. These settings, reasonably, correspond to some of the
more tangible physical risks that participants face — being
outed unintentionally, and being located or stalked. P18 ex-
plained how they changed their privacy settings to avoid being
found on Facebook:
“I used to get a lot of ‘Do you know this person’
about clients, even though we never interacted on
Facebook. I’ve never interacted with these clients
on Facebook and I don’t remember their real name
or anything, but they would pop up. . . . It’s not so
good. I had to make everything private.” (P18)
A few participants expressed doubt that security and privacy
settings would be effective. As P8 put it, “If we are online,
there isn’t a lot of hope for privacy.” P21 explained that they
do not trust privacy settings, and instead will opt for physical
or hardware solutions such as removing a phone from a room,
USENIX Association
30th USENIX Security Symposium    385
or using multiple devices, to make sure their mobile phone
does not collect information they do not want it to:
“I don’t really trust the whole system in this respect.
I think it doesn’t matter if you put [settings] on or
off. In case of doubt the phone will listen in, go
along, take notes. Sometimes, when I have to talk
about something, I mind that there isn’t a phone in
the room.” (P21)
That people do not or cannot rely on in-platform settings
to regulate their boundaries has also been observed in the
general population [73].
Security-focused tools. Similarly, few participants men-
tioned using tools speciﬁcally built for security and privacy.
In our survey, we asked whether they used several security
tools: encrypted messaging applications like WhatsApp or
Signal (32% reported using), a VPN (14%), encrypted email
(9%), Tor (9%), Password Managers (8%), or cryptocurrency
(5%). Interview participants reported two main barriers to
using such tools: feeling that the tools were too challenging to
use — either for themselves or their clients — or feeling that
the tools were not sufﬁciently effective given the effort neces-
sary to use them. P21 describes a friend setting up encrypted
email for them, which P21 no longer uses:
“I have an acquaintance who [will] only write en-
crypted emails, but that’s very effortful. . . . [They]
had to download an extra program for me. There
you always had a key and then you had to mess
with it forever until you could read that email, this
was way too stupid for me.” (P21)
Security tools can also get in the way of participants’ work
or other safety goals. P16 explained that they previously used
a VPN to obscure their location, but stopped because it created
new privacy risks and interfered with their business:
“Many VPNs will sell your data. Also, many of
the advertising platforms either are partly location-
based or won’t let you use their services if you’re
not coming from the country that they’re based
in. One of the U.K. [sex work advertising] plat-
forms. . . you have to have a local phone number
and be accessing that website from an IP within
that country.” (P16)
Further, even if a sex worker felt they were sufﬁciently
skilled to use a security tool, and felt that the tool was suf-
ﬁciently beneﬁcial, their clients may lack the digital skill or
interest to use such tools. One survey respondent commented
on our list of protective strategies:
“I would gladly do all of the above, but that re-
ally only works when the customers participate:
Threema / Signal / Telegram, PGP-encryption, cryp-
tocurrency...” (S49)
As S49 points out, all parties must use it before a new
tool like a messaging app or payment system can be useful.
This barrier of needing others to also comply with a security
protocol was similarly identiﬁed by journalists looking to
communicate securely with sources [50].
Resignation and regret. Finally, some of our participants
expressed resignation or apathy about safety. Some partici-
pants felt there was little they could do to be “100% safe at
this job” (S15). This led some participants to disregard safety
practices because they felt that the behaviors are not effective
or that harm is inevitable — a common response to corporate
surveillance [20]. P25 said:
“When I think about it, it’s like how safe are you,
really? How protected are you, really, when Google
can ﬁnd you anywhere, Facebook can ﬁnd you any-
where? I think the aspect or the perception of safety
is a little like, you can be found if someone really
wants to ﬁnd you. It’s not so difﬁcult anymore, espe-
cially with online presence and everything else. It
really depends what you’re trying to achieve.” (P25)
