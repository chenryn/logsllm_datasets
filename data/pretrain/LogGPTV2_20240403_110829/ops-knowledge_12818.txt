User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题PHP not running scripts, downloading them instead I know, a very typical problem, but I run out of ideas. Yes, the module is installed:

# aptitude search libapache2-mod-php5
i   libapache2-mod-php5                                                         - server-side, HTML-embedded scripting language (Apache 2 module)                       
p   libapache2-mod-php5filter                                                   - server-side, HTML-embedded scripting language (apache 2 filter module)


and enabled:

# ls -l /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/php*
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 27 2011-08-31 13:49 /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/php5.conf -&gt; ../mods-available/php5.conf
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 27 2011-08-31 13:49 /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/php5.load -&gt; ../mods-available/php5.load

# cat /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/php5.conf
&lt;IfModule mod_php5.c&gt;
  AddType application/x-httpd-php .php .phtml .php3 .php5
  AddType application/x-httpd-php-source .phps
&lt;/IfModule&gt;

# cat /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/php5.load
LoadModule php5_module /usr/lib/apache2/modules/libphp5.so


Apache claims PHP is lodade:

# apache2ctl -t -D DUMP_MODULES

There's no .htaccess in the document root and the 404 shows PHP as present:


  Apache/2.2.9 (Debian) PHP/5.2.6-1+lenny13 with Suhosin-Patch proxy_html/3.0.0 Server at wiki.example.com Port 80


The logs shows no errors.

Any ideas what else to check?

Assistant: You cannot have PHP and Passenger in the same location at the same time using the handler modules (each request is only "handled" once, and in this case, Passenger is handling the request).  If you must serve PHP from your rails app for some reason, you need to either make a specific Location or Directory and disable Passenger in that location like so:

&lt;Directory /var/www/php/goes/here&gt;
   PassengerEnabled off
&lt;/Directory&gt;


or

&lt;Location /php/goes/here&gt;
   PassengerEnabled off
&lt;/Location&gt;


More here in the official docs

It looks like turning off PassengerEnabled does not enable DirectoryIndex, so you may need to manually rewrite from ^/php/goes/here/$ to /php/goes/here/index.php

Also, it looks like using PassengerHighPerformance prevents you from turning it off.

Or, switch to using libapache2-mod-php5filter and fiddle with it until apache gets it to run as an output filter after passenger handles the request and outputs php code.
