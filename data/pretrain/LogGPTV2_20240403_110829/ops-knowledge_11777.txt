User: I have made a batch script which runs a Python application. This batch script is triggered by a program called System Scheduler, but when the program runs the batch script, it says that Python is not exisiting.
When I run my batch script manually, I get no error.
Can anyone explain this or come up with a solution?
Assistant: Check the user context that System Scheduler is running under and ensure the location of Python is in it's PATH.
