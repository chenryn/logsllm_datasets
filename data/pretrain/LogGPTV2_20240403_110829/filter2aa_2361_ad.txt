acceptable and economically justifiable business conduct.’”  Id. (citation omitted).  The Court
has found no case applying Murphy outside the context of antitrust, and Donnelly has cited
no case applying it to copyright law.5
Generally, liability for copyright infringement does not require knowledge of
wrongdoing on the part of the infringer.  The Copyright Act permits an award of damages
even where “the infringer was not aware and had no reason to believe that his or her acts
constituted infringement of copyright[.]”  17 U.S.C. § 504(c)(2); see also Coogan, 2005 WL
2789311, at *4 (noting that damages may be increased for willful infringement and stating
that a finding of willfulness “does not require that a defendant act with the ‘specific intent’
to violate the copyright protection”).  Similarly, courts hold that vicarious liability – even of
corporate officers – does not require knowledge that the conduct is infringing.  See MGM
Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd., 545 U.S. 913, 930 n.9 (2005) (vicarious liability may be
imposed “even if the defendant initially lacks knowledge of the infringement”); Fonovisa,
Inc. v. Cherry Auction, Inc., 76 F.3d 259, 262 (9th Cir. 1996) (vicarious liability may be
imposed “even though the defendant was unaware of the infringement”) (citation omitted);
S. Bell Tel. & Tel. Co. v. Associated Tel. Directory Publishers, 756 F.2d 801, 811 (11th Cir.
1985) (“[The corporate officers] all had a financial interest in the infringing activity and the
right to supervise [the infringer’s] activities.  Liability falls on all of them even if they were
ignorant of the infringement.”); Novell, Inc. v. Unicom Sales, Inc., No. C-03-2785 MMC,
2004 WL 1839117, at *17 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 17, 2004) (in determining the liability of
corporate officers “it is immaterial whether such individuals are aware that their acts will
result in infringement”); Foreverendeavor Music, Inc. v. S.M.B., Inc., 701 F. Supp. 791, 793
(W.D. Wash. 1988) (corporate officer’s doubts about the plaintiff’s right to enforce copyright

laws “[did] not absolve him from liability for infringing copyrights”).
Donnelly’s argues, with some persuasive force, that he should not be held personally
liable when he could not reasonably be expected to know that the Ninth Circuit applied
copyright law to the copying of software into RAM.  But copyright law is clear, as shown
by the cases cited above.  Knowledge is not required.  The Supreme Court has noted that
vicarious liability “allows imposition of liability when the defendant profits directly from the
infringement and has a right and ability to supervise the direct infringer, even if the defendant
initially lacks knowledge of the infringement.”  MGM Studios, 545 U.S. at 930 n.9.  In
support of this statement, the Supreme Court cited Shapiro, Bernstein & Co. v. H.L. Green
Co., 316 F.2d 304, 308 (2d Cir. 1963), a case which provides this helpful explanation of the
strict-liability policy of copyright law:
[T]he cases are legion which hold the dance hall proprietor liable for the
infringement of copyright resulting from the performance of a musical
composition by a band or orchestra whose activities provide the proprietor
with a source of customers and enhanced income.  He is liable whether the
bandleader is considered, as a technical matter, an employee or an independent
contractor, and whether or not the proprietor has knowledge of the
compositions to be played or any control over their selection.
We believe that the principle which can be extracted from the dance
hall cases is a sound one . . . .  Green licensed one facet of its variegated
business enterprise, for some thirteen years, to the Jalen Amusement
Company.  Green retained the ultimate right of supervision over the conduct
of the record concession and its employees.  By reserving for itself a
proportionate share of the gross receipts from Jalen’s sales of phonograph
records, Green had a most definite financial interest in the success of Jalen's
concession; 10% or 12% of the sales price of every record sold by Jalen,
whether “bootleg” or legitimate, found its way – both literally and figuratively
– into the coffers of the Green Company.  We therefore conclude . . . that
Green's relationship to its infringing licensee, as well as its strong concern for
the financial success of the phonograph record concession, renders it liable for
the unauthorized sales of the “bootleg” records.
The imposition of liability upon the Green Company, even in the
absence of an intention to infringe or knowledge of infringement, is not
unusual.  As one observer has noted, “Although copyright infringements are
quite generally termed piracy, only a minority of infringers fly the Jolly
Roger.”  While there have been some complaints concerning the harshness of
the principle of strict liability in copyright law, courts have consistently
refused to honor the defense of absence of knowledge or intention.  The
reasons have been variously stated.  “The protection accorded literary property
would be of little value if . . . insulation from payment of damages could be
secured . . . by merely refraining from making inquiry.”  “It is the innocent
infringer who must suffer, since he, unlike the copyright owner, either has an
opportunity to guard against the infringement (by diligent inquiry), or at least

the ability to guard against the infringement (by an indemnity agreement . . .
and/or by insurance).”
Shapiro, 316 F.2d at 307-08 (citations omitted); see Fonvisa, 76 F.3d at 261-64 (following
Shapiro and referring to it as the “landmark case” on vicarious liability for copyright
infringement).
Donnelly clearly supervised the infringing and circumventing activities of MDY and
profited personally from their success.  Applying this well-established law, Donnelly is liable
for MDY’s vicarious copyright infringement, contributory copyright infringement, and
DMCA violations.
IV.
Permanent Injunction.
Under 17 U.S.C. § 502(a), this Court “is empowered to grant a permanent injunction
‘as it may deem reasonable to prevent or restrain infringement of a copyright.’”  MGM
Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd., 518 F. Supp. 2d 1197, 1208 (C.D. Cal. 2007).  To obtain a
permanent injunction under section 502(a), Blizzard must satisfy a four-part test:  “(1) that
it has suffered an irreparable injury; (2) that remedies available at law, such as monetary
damages, are not adequate to compensate for that injury; (3) that, considering the balance of
hardships between the plaintiff and defendant, a remedy in equity is warranted; and (4) that
the public interest would not be disserved by a permanent injunction.”  eBay Inc. v.
MercExchange, L.L.C., 547 U.S. 388, 391-92 (2006).
Citing MAI Systems Corp. v. Peak Computer, Inc., 991 F.2d 511, 520 (9th Cir. 1993),
Blizzard asserts that courts have routinely granted permanent injunctions when liability has
been established and there is a threat of continuing violations.  Dkt. #97 at 6.  The Court
agrees with other district courts that MAI’s two-part rule did not survive eBay.  “MAI should
only be relevant to the extent it informs the eBay analysis.”  Grokster, 518 F. Supp. 2d at
1209-10; see Designer Skin, LLC v. S & L Vitamins, Inc., No. CV 05-3699-PHX-JAT, 2008
WL 4174882, at *3 (D. Ariz. Sept. 5, 2008).
Blizzard further asserts that courts in copyright cases traditionally have held that
irreparable harm is presumed.  Dkt. #97 at 6.  After eBay, however, the presumption of

irreparable harm no longer inures to the benefit of plaintiffs.  “The eBay Court plainly stated
that [p]laintiffs ‘must demonstrate’ the presence of the traditional factors, and therefore have
the burden of proof with regard to irreparable harm.”  Grokster, 518 F. Supp. 2d at 1211; see
Designer Skin, 2008 WL 4174882, at *4 (citing eBay, 547 U.S. at 391); Magna-RX, Inc. v.
Holley, No. CV 05-3545-PHX-EHC, 2008 WL 5068977, at *4 (D. Ariz. Nov. 25, 2008).
The Court will consider whether Blizzard has satisfied the four-part test for a
permanent injunction.
A.
Irreparable Injury.
Blizzard has established irreparable injury.  Blizzard can calculate the amount of
money it spends annually to detect and eliminate bots from its game, but Blizzard cannot
determine the extent of damage caused by Glider to Blizzard’s reputation and customer
goodwill.  As noted above, Blizzard received 500,000 customer complaints regarding bots
in WoW between December of 2004 and March of 2008.  The use of Glider gives a player
an unfair advantage over other players and imbalances the in-game economy.  The damage
to Blizzard’s reputation and customer goodwill constitutes irreparable harm.  See Rent-A-
Center, Inc. v. Canyon Television & Appliance Rental, Inc., 944 F.2d 597, 603 (9th Cir.
1991) (“[I]ntangible injuries, such as damage to ongoing recruitment efforts and goodwill,
qualify as irreparable harm.”); MySpace, Inc. v. Wallace, 498 F.Supp.2d 1293, 1305 (C.D.
Cal. 2007) (“Harm to business goodwill and reputation is unquantifiable and considered
irreparable.”).
B.
Remedies at Law.
This factor is closely related to the first.  Because the damage to Blizzard’s goodwill
and the loss of its customers caused by Glider cannot be calculated with any certainty,
traditional legal remedies such as monetary damages are inadequate to redress Blizzard’s
harm.
C.
Balance of Hardships.
On one hand, failure to enjoin the sale of Glider will result in a continuation of
Blizzard’s injuries.  On the other hand, enjoining the sale of Glider will put MDY out of

business and eliminate a significant source of income for Donnelly.  MDY and Donnelly
argue that their hardship would be greater and urge the Court to deny a permanent injunction.
In the preliminary injunction context, the Ninth Circuit has noted that “[w]here the
only hardship that the defendant will suffer is lost profits from an activity which has been
shown likely to be infringing, such an argument in defense ‘merits little equitable
consideration[.]’”  Triad Sys. Corp. v. Se. Express Co., 64 F.3d 1330, 1338 (9th Cir. 1995)
(citation omitted).  Where, as here, the conduct has been shown to be both tortious and
infringing, this principle applies with even greater force.  An injunction may force the closure
of MDY’s business, but that business is based on contributory and vicarious copyright
infringement.  The hardship factor favors an injunction.
D.
Public Interest.
Congress has determined that the public interest is served by protecting the creative
works of those who obtain copyright protection.  Congress has concluded in the DMCA that
the public interest disfavors those who circumvent technological measures designed to
protect creative works.  Although the public interest also favors creativity and open
competition, MDY is not a competitor of Blizzard.  MDY does not offer a competing
computer game.  Rather, MDY persuades Blizzard customers to violate their contract with
Blizzard for MDY’s financial advantage.  The public interest may favor full and honest
competition, but MDY ultimately is an exploiter, not a competitor. 
E.
Conclusion.
The Court finds that all four requirements for a permanent injunction are satisfied.
The Court will enter a permanent injunction against the continued sale, distribution, and
servicing of Glider.
V.
Stay of the Injunction.
MDY and Donnelly argue that the Court’s decision may be reversed on appeal and
that MDY should not be put out of business while the appeal is pending.  Donnelly testified
that even twelve months of injunction would put MDY out of business forever.
The Court recognizes that MDY and Donnelly will ask the Ninth Circuit to overturn

the RAM-copying and ownership holdings of MAI Systems Corp. v. Peak Computer, Inc.,
991 F.2d 511 (9th Cir. 1993).  The Court also recognizes that reasonable minds can disagree
on whether these holdings are correct.  Because the parties have not briefed the stay of a
permanent injunction, the Court will require the parties to file memoranda addressing that
issue.  The Court will not enter the permanent injunction until it has decided whether the
injunction should be stayed pending appeal.
IT IS ORDERED:
1.
MDY is liable to Blizzard for violations of 17 U.S.C. §§ 1201(a)(2) and
1201(b)(1) with respect to the dynamic nonliteral elements of WoW.
2.
Michael Donnelly is liable to Blizzard for damages arising from MDY’s
tortious interference with contract from November 30, 2005, to the present.
3.
Michael Donnelly is liable to Blizzard for damages arising from MDY’s
contributory infringement, vicarious infringement, and DMCA violations.
4.
Blizzard is entitled to a permanent injunction against the continued sale,
distribution, and servicing of Glider.
5.
On or before February 13, 2009, the parties shall submit memoranda, not to
exceed seven pages in length, addressing (1) the appropriate terms of any
permanent injunction, (2) whether the permanent injunction should be stayed
pending appeal, and (3) what bond or other measures – for stay of the
injunction and for damages – should be imposed for Blizzard’s protection
pending appeal.
DATED this 28th day of January, 2009.
