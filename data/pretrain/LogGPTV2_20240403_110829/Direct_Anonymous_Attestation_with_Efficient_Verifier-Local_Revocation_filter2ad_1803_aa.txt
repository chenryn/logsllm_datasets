## Abstract
For computing platforms compliant with the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) standard, Direct Anonymous Attestation (DAA) is a suitable cryptographic protocol for implementing anonymous subscription systems. DAA leverages a securely embedded cryptographic key in the platform's hardware to enable privacy-preserving authentication. However, existing DAA schemes suffer from significant computational and communication costs that increase proportionally with the size of the revocation list, making them impractical for large-scale applications.

In this paper, we propose a novel scheme called Lightweight Anonymous Subscription with Efficient Revocation (LASER) to address these issues. LASER significantly reduces the computational and communication costs associated with the platform's signature generation by shifting most of these costs from the online procedure (signature generation) to the offline procedure (key/credential acquisition). We have implemented LASER on a laptop equipped with an on-board TPM, making it the first implementation of a DAA scheme on a TPM 2.0-compliant cryptoprocessor.

## 1. Introduction
The rapid growth of online electronic subscription services has led to increased concerns about user anonymity and privacy. Users often want to remain anonymous to prevent service providers from tracking their interests, usage patterns, and personal details. To address this, researchers have focused on developing Anonymous Subscription Systems (ASS), where users can access services while remaining anonymous and authenticated [4, 5, 20, 22, 23].

Direct Anonymous Attestation (DAA) is a cryptographic protocol well-suited for ASS, as it enables privacy-preserving authentication using a cryptographic key embedded in the platform's hardware [7]. A DAA scheme involves three entities: a platform, a verifier, and an issuer. The platform (subscribed user) uses a host and a TPM to generate an anonymous signature on a login request message. The host assists the TPM by performing computationally expensive operations. The verifier checks the validity of the signature and the revocation status of the platform.

The Trusted Computing Group (TCG) has standardized ECC-based DAA in TPM 2.0 [8, 14, 28], which is also published as ISO/IEC 11889:2015 [21]. Despite improvements in DAA security and efficacy, existing schemes still face the challenge of inefficient revocation check procedures [7–9, 11, 14, 15]. These schemes use a signature-based revocation check, where the revocation list contains tuples from malicious login signatures. For each revoked tuple, the platform must generate a proof of non-revocation, leading to linear increases in computational complexity and communication overhead [12, 25]. This makes DAA impractical for real-world applications, especially those with stringent latency requirements.

In this paper, we introduce LASER, a novel ECC-based DAA scheme that addresses the scalability issue of revocation. LASER significantly reduces the computational and communication costs of the login signature generation by enabling controlled verifier-local revocation and shifting costs from the online to the offline procedure. This makes LASER more practical for real-world subscription systems, even with long revocation lists.

## 2. Proposed Scheme: LASER

### 2.1 Definition and Overview of LASER

**Definition 2.1.** LASER consists of the following protocols:

1. **Setup(1λ):** The issuer runs this algorithm with a security parameter 1λ, outputting an issuer’s secret key (isk) and a group public key (gpk).
2. **MemCreGen(gpk, isk, ms):** The TPM and host run this registration protocol with the issuer to join the group. The inputs are gpk, isk, and ms (number of absolutely unlinkable credentials). The TPM generates a secret key (tsk), a public key (tpk), and a key handle (hdl). The host acquires membership credentials (memCrej) and outputs a membership credential list (mcl).
3. **LogCreGen(gpk, isk, ctl, tsk, hdl, tpk, memCrej):** The TPM and host run this login credential acquisition protocol with the issuer. The inputs include gpk, isk, a credential token list (ctl), tsk, hdl, tpk, and memCrej. The issuer updates ctl and the host acquires a login credential (logCrej).
4. **SelectLogCre(lcl, cul, csr):** The host runs this credential selection algorithm with inputs lcl, cul, and csr. The host selects a login credential (logCrej) based on the rule csr and outputs the updated list cul′.
5. **Sign(gpk, tsk, hdl, tpk, logCrej, M):** The TPM and host perform this login signature generation protocol. The inputs are gpk, tsk, hdl, tpk, logCrej, and a login request message M. The protocol outputs a login signature σs.
6. **Verify(gpk, σs, M, tRL):** This verification algorithm takes gpk, a purported login signature σs, a login request message M, and a token-based revocation list (tRL) as inputs. It verifies the signature and the revocation status of the login credential.
7. **Revoke(gpk, ctl, σs, M, tRL):** This signature-based revocation algorithm is used by the issuer to revoke the login credential of a compromised platform. It updates tRL and outputs the updated list tRL′.
8. **Identify(gpk, σs, M, tsk∗):** This signature tracing algorithm takes gpk, σs, M, and a TPM’s secret key tsk∗ as inputs. It outputs true if σs was generated using tsk∗; otherwise, it outputs false.

### Technical Details and Contributions
In LASER, the platform obtains two types of credentials: membership credentials through the MemCreGen protocol and login credentials through the LogCreGen protocol. The MemCreGen protocol registers the platform with the issuer, and the LogCreGen protocol acquires login credentials. Each login credential includes a revocation token (yj), and the issuer publishes a token-based revocation list (tRL) containing all revoked tokens.

During the Sign protocol, the platform generates a signature on the login request message, including a "token response" computed by exponentiating the token yj over a randomly selected base. The Verify algorithm checks the signature's validity and the revocation status by comparing the token response with the exponentiation of each revoked token in tRL.

Unlike existing DAA schemes, LASER does not require the platform to generate proofs of non-revocation, significantly reducing computational and communication overhead. This makes LASER scalable and practical for real-world subscription systems with large revocation lists.

## Implementation and Results
We have implemented LASER on a laptop with an on-board TPM, validating our analytical results. This is the first implementation of an anonymous authentication scheme using a TPM 2.0-compliant cryptoprocessor. Our results demonstrate that LASER achieves multiple orders of magnitude lower computational and communication costs compared to existing DAA schemes.
