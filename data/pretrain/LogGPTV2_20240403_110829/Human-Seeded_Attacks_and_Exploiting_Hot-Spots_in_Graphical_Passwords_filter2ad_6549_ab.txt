### Results and Analysis

**Figure 1: Popular Clusters and Their Sizes**
- **Description**: This figure shows the five most popular clusters (in terms of size, i.e., the number of times selected) and the number of popular clusters (size ≥ 5). The results are based on data from 32 to 40 users, depending on the image, for the final passwords created on each image.
- **Example**: For the pcb image, which shows only 6 clusters of size ≥ 5, the sizes of clusters 2-5 become 5, 5, 4, and 3 when counting at most one click per user.

**Cluster Probability and Confidence Intervals**
- **Probability Calculation**: The probability \( p_j \) of a cluster \( j \) being clicked is calculated as the cluster size divided by the total number of clicks observed.
- **Confidence Interval**: When the probability \( p_j \) of a certain cluster is sufficiently high, a confidence interval can be placed around it for future populations using Equation (1):
  \[
  p \pm z_{\alpha/2} \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}
  \]
  where \( n \) is the total number of clicks, \( p \) takes the role of \( p_j \), \( q = 1 - p \), and \( z_{\alpha/2} \) is from a z-table. A confidence interval can be placed around \( p_j \) (and thus \( P_j \)) when \( np \geq 5 \) and \( nq \geq 5 \).

**Table 1: 95% Confidence Intervals for Top 5 Clusters in Four Images**
- **Description**: Table 1 shows the 95% confidence intervals for the top 5 clusters found in each of four images. The confidence intervals predict the percentage of users expected to choose these clusters in future populations.
- **Example**: For the pool image, the highest frequency cluster (of size 13) was chosen by 37.1% of participants. Using the confidence interval, between 17.7% and 56.6% of users from future populations are expected to choose this same cluster with 95% confidence.

**Clustering Effect and Hot-Spots**
- **Observations**: Figures 1 and 2, along with Table 1, clearly show that hot-spots are very prominent on a wide range of images. Many images have significantly more hot-spots than would be expected if all T-regions were equi-probable.
- **Examples**: The paperclips, cars, faces, and tea images are less susceptible to hot-spotting compared to others like mural, truck, and Philadelphia. For instance, the cars image had only 4 clusters of size at least 5, while the mural image had 15 clusters of size at least 5.

**Impact of Background Images**
- **Previous Assumptions**: Previous work suggested using intuition to choose more secure background images, but our results show that intuition is not a reliable indicator. Of the four images used in other click-based graphical password studies, three showed a large degree of clustering (pool, mural, and Philadelphia).
- **Automated Predictors**: Finding reliable automated predictors of more secure background images remains an open problem. Our preliminary work with simple measures (image segmentation, corner detection, and image contrast measurement) did not offer reliable indicators.

### Security Measures and Comparison

**Entropy and Expected Number of Guesses**
- **Formal Measures**: To compare the relative impact of hot-spotting on each image, we calculated two formal measures of password security for each image: entropy \( H(X) \) and the expected number of guesses \( E(f(X)) \) to correctly guess a password, assuming the attacker knows the probabilities \( w_i > 0 \) for each password \( i \).
- **Equations**:
  \[
  H(X) = - \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i \log(w_i)
  \]
  \[
  E(f(X)) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} i \cdot w_i
  \]
  where \( n \) is the number of passwords, \( X \) ranges over the passwords, and \( w_i = P(X = x_i) \) is calculated based on observed user data.

**Comparison to Baseline**
- **Baseline (C U)**: We compared our results to a baseline \( C U \) that approximates what we would expect to see after running 32 users, assuming a uniformly random alphabet of size 207.
- **Results**: Figure 3 depicts the entropy and expected number of guesses for \( C V \). The comparison to the marked \( C U \) values indicates that previous rough estimates are a security overestimate for practical security in all images, some much more so than others.

**Field Study Validation**
- **Validation**: These results appear to provide a fair approximation of the entropy and expected number of guesses for the larger set of users in the field study. For both the pool and cars images, the entropy measures were within one bit of the values measured here, and the number of expected guesses increased for both images.

**Conclusion**
- **Impact of Background Image**: The variation across all images highlights the significant impact of the background image, even when using images that are "intuitively" good. For example, the mural image, chosen for an earlier PassPoints usability study, showed the most impact from hot-spotting.
- **Best Performing Image**: The paperclips image scores best in the charted security measures, but 8 out of 36 users who created a password on this image could not perform the subsequent login, indicating potential usability issues.

### Figure 3: Entropy and Expected Number of Guesses for \( C V \)
- **Description**: This figure shows the entropy and expected number of guesses for \( C V \). The variation between images and the drop in \( E(f(X)) \) from \( C U \) are notable.
