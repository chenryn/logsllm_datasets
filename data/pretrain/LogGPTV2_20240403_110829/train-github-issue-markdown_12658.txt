Using elasticsearch java api 1.4.3, I think I'm experiencing a problem similar
to what I reported at yakaz/elasticsearch-action-updatebyquery#27 but this
time it is the official API that seem to have the issue:
    val qb = QueryBuilders.constantScoreQuery(FilterBuilders.termFilter("user", "kimchy"))
    // returns false, which is expected because I have no such document in my index
    client.prepareExists("myIndex")
          .setTypes("myType")
          .setQuery(qb)
          .execute().actionGet().exists()
    // returns true... for any query with an empty (but existing) index/type, which is obviously wrong
    client.exists(client.prepareExists("myIndex")
          .setTypes("myType")
          .setQuery(qb)
          .request()).actionGet().exists()
I think `ExistsRequestBuilder.request()` is the problem here and I need to get
an ExistsRequest as it is what my elasticsearch wrapper expects.
