User: Please explain what is DNS, and what is the role and principle of DNS in network architecture?
Assistant: DNS (Domain Name System) is a distributed database and network protocol used to map domain names to corresponding IP addresses. The function of DNS is to convert an easy-to-remember domain name into an IP address that a computer can understand, and to establish a connection between computers during the online period. Because computers cannot memorize large numbers of numerical IP addresses like humans can, the DNS system helps users access many websites more easily and makes the Internet easier to use. DNS works by layering domain names, with each layer having a domain name and at least one server. The process by which DNS converts a domain name into an IP address includes the following steps: 1. The client requests a specific domain name. 2. The client sends a request to the local domain name server. 3. If the domain name is cached on the local server, the response will be returned directly. 4. If the domain name is not cached on the local server, a request is sent to the root domain name server. 5. The root domain name server returns the address of the top-level domain name server. 6. The local server sends a request to the top-level domain name server to obtain the address of the authoritative DNS server under the domain name. 7. The local server sends a request to the authoritative DNS server to obtain the IP address corresponding to the domain name. 8. The local server caches the obtained IP address and returns it to the client. The above process may involve the interaction of multiple DNS servers until the required information is obtained. The role of DNS is to provide name resolution services for the Internet in the most efficient manner.
