A g-SIS speciﬁcation is Most Restrictive if it satisﬁes the fol-
lowing LTL formula:
2(Authz ↔ (¬SR ∧ ¬SL) S (SA ∧ (¬SL S SJ)))
The Most Restrictive g-SIS Speciﬁcation only allows Strict
operations. The above formula says that a subject is autho-
rized to access an object if and only if both are still part
of the group since the object was added (indicated by S
temporal operator). Also, when the object was added, the
subject was a current member of the group. Because of SJ
and SL, we only need to consider the case where an object is
added after the subject joins the group since subjects can-
not access objects added prior to their join time. The 2
operator says that the formula should hold in every state.
A highly ﬂexible g-SIS model could simply allow diﬀerent
types of operations on a case by case basis. For example,
SJ for s1, LJ when s1 re-joins, LJ for s2, LL for s1, SL for
s2, SJ when s2 re-joins, etc. (similarly for objects). In this
case, we would have one all encompassing speciﬁcation.
3. USAGE SCENARIOS
We now discuss two usage scenarios: a large-scale sub-
scriptions scenario where the operations are ﬁxed for all
subjects and a small-scale collaboration scenario where the
operations could be mixed.
3.1 Subscription Service
In general, subject operations deﬁne the semantics of most
subscription models. Thus most subscription models fall
into one of the four categories: (SJ, SL), (SJ, LL), (LJ, SL)
and (LJ, LL). Consider a premier online news magazine ABS
Corp. that oﬀers four levels of membership:
1. Level 1; $10/year (SJ, SL): These subscribers can ac-
cess news articles that are published after they started
paying the subscription fee. Level 1 subscribers cannot
access ABS’s archives (eﬀected by SJ). If they cancel
their subscription, they lose access to all news articles.
2. Level 2; $12/year (SJ, LL): Similar to Level 1 but sub-
scribers can retain access to news articles that they
paid for even after canceling their subscription.
3. Level 3; $15/year (LJ, SL): Level 3 subscribers can ac-
cess rich archives ﬁlled with post-news analysis, pre-
dictions, annotations and opinions from experts,
in
addition to future articles. But if they cancel their
subscription, they lose access to everything including
archives.
4. Level 4; $17/year (LJ, LL): Similar to Level 3, but even
after canceling membership, subscribers can login and
view all articles that they had access before leaving.

objects (e.g. o2) authorized during the membership period.
An LL will allow s1 to retain access to o2.
Strict Add (SA) Vs Liberal Add (LA): In SA, the added
object can be accessed only by subjects already in the group.
In LA, there are no such restrictions. The added object may
be accessed by subjects that join later. If Add (o2) in ﬁgure 3
is an SA, only s1 can access the object. Subjects s2 and s3,
joining later, cannot access this object. But on LA current
subject s1 and future subjects s2 and s3 may access o2.
Strict Remove (SR) Vs Liberal Remove (LR): In SR, the
removed object cannot be accessed by any subject. In LR,
subjects who had access to the object at the time of Remove
may continue to access (of course subjects joining later are
not allowed to access the removed object.
In ﬁgure 3, if
Remove (o1) is an SR, every group subject (including s1)
loses access to o1. If Remove (o1) is an LR, s1 can continue
to access o1. However s2 and s3 will not have access to o1.
2.1
g-SIS Lattice
Let us ﬁrst consider g-SIS models where the group oper-
ations are ﬁxed for all subjects and objects. For example, a
g-SIS model may only allow Liberal operations for all sub-
jects and objects (LJ, LL, LA, LR) in the group. That is,
every subject that is admitted to the group will be given
LJ. Similarly, objects will be added only with LA and so
on. Another example of a ﬁxed operations model is (SJ, SL,
SA, SR) where all operations are Strict.
Thus if the type of operations are ﬁxed for all subjects
and objects, there are 16 possible models ranging from the
most restrictive model allowing only Strict operations: (SJ,
SL, SA, SR) to the most permissive model allowing only
Liberal operations: (LJ, LL, LA, LR). This is illustrated in
ﬁgure 4. Parts (a) through (d) show that the Strict opera-
tion is more restrictive than the Liberal operation. Parts (e)
and (f) show the subject and object model that is obtained
by the Cartesian product of subject and object operations
respectively. Finally, a lattice of 16 g-SIS models can be ob-
tained by a Cartesian product of subject and object models
(parts (e) and (f)). Due to space constraints, the ﬁnal lattice
with 16 models is not shown. Note that if the most restric-
tive model (SJ, SL, SA, SR) permits a subject to access an
386Object operations do not fundamentally change the sub-
scription model’s semantics. Nevertheless, they model useful
scenarios. For example, if an object is added with SA, only
existing subjects in the group may access. Thus SA objects
model sales promotion or discounted price available only to
current group members.
3.2 Mission Oriented Group
Consider a g-SIS model with the operation types: (LJ, SL,
SA/LA, SR) where all operations are ﬁxed except object
Add. Objects can be added to the group by type SA or
LA. Let us consider a simple collaboration scenario where
the group is mission oriented, so many users may Join and
Leave the group to contribute and receive information over
time.
Consider two subjects Alice and Bob who Join the group
at the same time. If Bob wants to ensure that any infor-
mation he shares with Alice is not accessible to future sub-
jects who may Join the group, he can add objects with SA.
SA objects are only accessible to existing members at Add
time. This allows current members of the group to share
information privately. On the other hand, to the mission’s
end, information can be made available to future subjects
by LA’ing objects to the group. Suppose Alice leaves the
group and later Cathy joins with LJ. Cathy cannot access
SA objects shared between Alice and Bob before her join
time. Cathy can only access existing LA objects.
4. RELATED WORK AND CONCLUSION
Older approaches to Secure Information Sharing (SIS) can
be classiﬁed into at least three categories. First is Discre-
tionary Access Control (DAC) [8, 11, 7] which proposes to
enforce controls on sharing information at the discretion of
the “owner” of the object. Although, this is similar in objec-
tive to SIS, DAC fails to solve the problem since it does not
correlate the controls on copies of information with copies
of the original. The second is Mandatory Access Control
(MAC) [5, 6, 7] which allows information to ﬂow in one di-
rection in a lattice of security labels. Copies of information
made from one or more objects inherit the least upper bound
of the labels from the individual objects. Thereby the copies
are controlled at least as strictly as the original. Historically,
one directional information ﬂow has not been the most com-
mon requirement of SIS. The third is Originator Control or
ORCON [9, 13] in which the owner of the object decides
which user(s) may have access to it. The owner is the prin-
cipal source of the policy to be enforced. As information
ﬂows from one container to another, the policy is also prop-
agated.
In other words, it is a “sticky policy”. Recently,
information sharing challenges have been considered in the
context of Dynamic Coalition Problem or DCP (see [14, 4]
for example). The DCP is concerned with the challenges in-
volved when a coalition is dynamically formed, for example,
in response to a crisis. Government, civilian and other com-
mercial organizations may need to form a coalition (who may
otherwise distrust each other) and share information quickly
to solve the problem at hand. Our approach to information
sharing is primarily diﬀerent in that it focuses on authoriza-
tions involving the temporal aspect of group membership.
In this paper, we proposed a Group-Centric family of mod-
els for Secure Information Sharing. We identiﬁed a few use-
ful variations of group operations whose semantics are tem-
poral in nature. The framework can accommodate addi-
tional semantics that may turn out to be useful beyond those
identiﬁed in the paper. In future papers we will report for-
malization of these models and identiﬁcation of a layered set
of g-SIS properties.
