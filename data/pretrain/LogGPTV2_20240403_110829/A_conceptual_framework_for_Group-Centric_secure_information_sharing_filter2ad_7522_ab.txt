### Most Restrictive g-SIS Specification

A g-SIS (Group-Centric Secure Information Sharing) specification is considered the **Most Restrictive** if it satisfies the following Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formula:
\[ \Box (\text{Authz} \leftrightarrow (\neg \text{SR} \land \neg \text{SL}) \, \mathbf{S} \, (\text{SA} \land (\neg \text{SL} \, \mathbf{S} \, \text{SJ}))) \]

This specification ensures that only **Strict** operations are allowed. The LTL formula states that a subject is authorized to access an object if and only if both the subject and the object have been part of the group since the object was added (indicated by the \(\mathbf{S}\) temporal operator). Additionally, at the time the object was added, the subject must have been a current member of the group. The \(\text{SJ}\) and \(\text{SL}\) conditions imply that we only need to consider cases where an object is added after the subject joins the group, as subjects cannot access objects added before their join time. The \(\Box\) operator indicates that this condition must hold in every state.

### Highly Flexible g-SIS Model

A highly flexible g-SIS model can allow different types of operations on a case-by-case basis. For example, a subject \(s_1\) might be given \(\text{SJ}\), and then \(\text{LJ}\) when they re-join, while another subject \(s_2\) might be given \(\text{LJ}\) initially, followed by \(\text{LL}\) for \(s_1\), and \(\text{SL}\) for \(s_2\). In such a scenario, a single, all-encompassing specification would be needed to cover these various cases.

### Usage Scenarios

We will now discuss two usage scenarios: a large-scale subscription service and a small-scale collaboration scenario.

#### 3.1 Subscription Service

In most subscription models, the semantics are defined by the subject operations. These models typically fall into one of four categories: \((\text{SJ}, \text{SL})\), \((\text{SJ}, \text{LL})\), \((\text{LJ}, \text{SL})\), and \((\text{LJ}, \text{LL})\).

Consider a premier online news magazine, ABS Corp., which offers four levels of membership:

1. **Level 1; $10/year (\(\text{SJ}, \text{SL}\))**: Subscribers can access news articles published after they start paying the subscription fee. They cannot access ABS's archives (enforced by \(\text{SJ}\)). If they cancel their subscription, they lose access to all news articles.
   
2. **Level 2; $12/year (\(\text{SJ}, \text{LL}\))**: Similar to Level 1, but subscribers retain access to news articles they paid for even after canceling their subscription.
   
3. **Level 3; $15/year (\(\text{LJ}, \text{SL}\))**: Subscribers can access rich archives filled with post-news analysis, predictions, annotations, and opinions from experts, in addition to future articles. However, if they cancel their subscription, they lose access to everything, including the archives.
   
4. **Level 4; $17/year (\(\text{LJ}, \text{LL}\))**: Similar to Level 3, but even after canceling membership, subscribers can log in and view all articles they had access to before leaving.

**Figure 4** illustrates a family of g-SIS models, showing the Cartesian product of Subject and Object Models, resulting in a lattice of 16 g-SIS models with fixed operation types.

#### 3.2 Mission-Oriented Group

Consider a g-SIS model with the operation types: \((\text{LJ}, \text{SL}, \text{SA/LA}, \text{SR})\), where all operations are fixed except for object addition. Objects can be added to the group using either \(\text{SA}\) or \(\text{LA}\).

In a mission-oriented group, many users may join and leave over time to contribute and receive information. For example, if Alice and Bob join the group simultaneously and Bob wants to ensure that any information he shares with Alice is not accessible to future subjects who join the group, he can add objects with \(\text{SA}\). \(\text{SA}\) objects are only accessible to existing members at the time of addition, allowing current members to share information privately. Conversely, to make information available to future subjects, objects can be added with \(\text{LA}\). If Alice leaves the group and Cathy later joins with \(\text{LJ}\), Cathy cannot access \(\text{SA}\) objects shared between Alice and Bob before her join time but can access existing \(\text{LA}\) objects.

### Related Work and Conclusion

Older approaches to Secure Information Sharing (SIS) can be classified into at least three categories:

1. **Discretionary Access Control (DAC)** [8, 11, 7]: This approach enforces controls on sharing information at the discretion of the "owner" of the object. Although similar in objective to SIS, DAC fails to correlate controls on copies of information with the original.

2. **Mandatory Access Control (MAC)** [5, 6, 7]: This allows information to flow in one direction in a lattice of security labels. Copies of information inherit the least upper bound of the labels from the individual objects, ensuring that the copies are controlled at least as strictly as the original. Historically, one-directional information flow has not been the most common requirement of SIS.

3. **Originator Control (ORCON)** [9, 13]: In this approach, the owner of the object decides which users may have access to it. The policy is propagated as information flows, making it a "sticky policy."

Recently, information sharing challenges have been considered in the context of the Dynamic Coalition Problem (DCP) [14, 4]. The DCP addresses the challenges involved in dynamically forming coalitions, such as in response to a crisis. Our approach to information sharing focuses on authorizations involving the temporal aspect of group membership.

In this paper, we proposed a Group-Centric family of models for Secure Information Sharing. We identified useful variations of group operations with temporal semantics. The framework can accommodate additional semantics beyond those identified in the paper. In future work, we will formalize these models and identify a layered set of g-SIS properties.
