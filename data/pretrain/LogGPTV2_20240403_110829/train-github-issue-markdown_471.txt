After upgrading from Ansible 1.3 to 1.6, I encountered an issue with asynchronous tasks that need to be skipped. The tasks work correctly when they are not skipped. Below is the task definition and the steps to reproduce the error.

### Task Definition
```yaml
- name: Create screen session to run dd on new disk (async mode)
  shell: /bin/dd if={{ ebs_device }} of=/dev/null bs=1024k
  async: 36000
  poll: 0
  tags: rundd
  when: ebs_iops != 0
```

### Execution Steps
To reproduce the error, execute the following command with `ebs_iops` set to 0:
```sh
ansible-playbook -i cluster-oe setup.yml -s --ask-vault-pass --tags rundd
```

### Output
```sh
TASK: [common | Create screen session to run dd on new disk (async mode)]
skipping: [X.X.X.X]
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/bin/ansible-playbook", line 317, in <module>
    sys.exit(main(sys.argv[1:]))
  File "/usr/bin/ansible-playbook", line 257, in main
    pb.run()
  File "/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/ansible/playbook/__init__.py", line 291, in run
    if not self._run_play(play):
  File "/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/ansible/playbook/__init__.py", line 644, in _run_play
    if not self._run_task(play, task, False):
  File "/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/ansible/playbook/__init__.py", line 421, in _run_task
    results = self._run_task_internal(task)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/ansible/playbook/__init__.py", line 385, in _run_task_internal
    self.runner_callbacks.on_async_ok(host, res, poller.runner.vars_cache[host]['ansible_job_id'])
KeyError: 'ansible_job_id'
```

### Additional Information
- **Ansible Version**: 1.6.1

The error occurs when the task is skipped, and it seems to be related to the `ansible_job_id` key not being present in the `vars_cache`. This issue did not occur in Ansible 1.3.
