Abstract—Disposable email services provide temporary email
addresses, which allows people to register online accounts without
exposing their real email addresses. In this paper, we perform
the ﬁrst measurement study on disposable email services with
two main goals. First, we aim to understand what disposable
email services are used for, and what risks (if any) are involved
in the common use cases. Second, we use the disposable email
services as a public gateway to collect a large-scale email dataset
for measuring email tracking. Over three months, we collected a
dataset from 7 popular disposable email services which contain
2.3 million emails sent by 210K domains. We show that online
accounts registered through disposable email addresses can be
easily hijacked,
information leakage and
ﬁnancial loss. By empirically analyzing email tracking, we ﬁnd
that third-party tracking is highly prevalent, especially in the
emails sent by popular services. We observe that trackers are
using various methods to hide their tracking behavior such as
falsely claiming the size of tracking images or hiding real trackers
behind redirections. A few top trackers stand out in the tracking
ecosystem but are not yet dominating the market.

I. INTRODUCTION
An Email address is one of the most important components
of personally identiﬁable information (PII) on the Internet.
Today’s online services typically require an email for account
registration and password recovery. Unfortunately, email ad-
dresses are often unprotected. For example, email addresses
used to register online social networks might be collected by
malicious third-parties [45], thus exposing users to spam and
spear phishing attacks [40]. Massive data breaches, especially
those at sensitive services (e.g., Ashley Madison [22]), can
expose user footprints online, leading to real-world scandals.
In addition, email addresses are often leaked together with
passwords [51], [56], allowing malicious parties to link user
identities across different services and compromise user ac-
counts via targeted password guessing [57].
As a result, disposable email services have become a
popular alternative which allows users to use online services
without giving away their real email addresses. From dis-
posable email services, a user can obtain a temporary email
address without registration. After a short period of time, the
emails will be disposed by the service providers. Users can use
this disposable email address for certain tasks (e.g., registering
an account on a dating website) without linking their online
footprints to their real email addresses (e.g., work or personal
email). In this way, potential attacks (e.g., spam, phishing,
privacy leakage) will be drawn to the disposable addresses
instead of the users’ real email accounts. Disposable email
services are highly popular. For example, Guerrilla Mail, one
of the earliest services, has processed 8 billion emails in the
past decade [3].
While disposable email services allow users to hide their
real identities, the email communication itself is not necessar-
ily private. More speciﬁcally, most disposable email services
maintain a public inbox, allowing any user to access any
disposable email addresses at any time [6], [5]. Essentially
disposable email services are acting as a public email gateway
to receive emails. The “public” nature not only raises interest-
ing questions about the security of the disposable email service
itself, but also presents a rare opportunity to empirically collect
email data and study email tracking, a problem that is not
well-understood.
In this paper, we have two goals. First, we want
to
understand what disposable email services are used for in
practice, and whether there are potential security or privacy
risks involved with using a disposable email address. Second,
we use disposable email services as a public “honeypot” to
collect emails sent by various online services and analyze
email tracking in the wild. Unlike the extensively-studied web
tracking [29], [34], [43], [48], [9], [10], [18], email tracking
is not well-understood primarily due to a lack of large-scale
email datasets. The largest study so far [17] has analyzed
emails from 902 “Shopping” and “News” websites. In this
paper, we aim to signiﬁcantly increase the measurement scale
and uncover new tracking techniques.
Understanding Disposable Email Services.
In this paper,
we collect data from 7 popular disposable email services from
October 16, 2017 to January 16, 2018 over three months. By
monitoring 56,589 temporary email addresses under popular
usernames, we collect in total 2,332,544 incoming email mes-
sages sent from 210,373 online services and organizations. We
are well aware of the sensitivity of email data. In addition to
working with IRB, we also take active steps to ensure research
ethics such as detecting and removing PII from the email
content and removing personal emails. Our analysis reveals
key ﬁndings about the usage of disposable email services.
First, there is often a delay to dispose of the incoming
emails. Certain services would hold the emails for as long
as 30 days, in spite of the claimed 25 minutes expiration
time. Second, we ﬁnd that users are using disposable email
addresses to register accounts in a variety of online services.
While the vast majority of emails are spam and notiﬁcations,

we did ﬁnd a large number of emails (89,329) that are
used for account registration, sending authentication code, and
even password reset. Third, accounts registered via disposable
emails are easily hijackable. We ﬁnd risky usage of dispos-
able email addresses such as registering sensitive accounts at
ﬁnancial services (e.g., PayPal), purchasing bitcoins, receiving
scanned documents, and applying for healthcare programs.
Measuring Email Tracking.
Email tracking involves em-
bedding a small image (i.e., tracking pixel) into the email body
to tell a remote server when and where the email is opened
by which user. When the email is opened, the email client
fetches the pixel and this notiﬁes the trackers. To measure
email tracking in the wild, we build a new tool to detect both
ﬁrst-party tracking (where the email sender and the tracker are
the same) and third-party tracking (where the email sender and
the tracker are different) from the collected email dataset.
in the tracking ecosystem,
We have three key observations. First, email tracking is
highly prevalent, especially with popular online services. Out
of the 2.3 million emails, 24.6% of them contain at least one
tracking link. In terms of sender domains, there are 2,052
sender domains (out of 210K domains in our dataset) ranked
within the Alexa top 10K. About 50% of these high-ranked
domains perform tracking in their emails. Second, we ﬁnd that
stealthy tracking techniques are universally preferred, either
by falsely claiming the size of tracking images in HTML or
hiding the real trackers through redirection. Popular online
services are signiﬁcantly more likely to use “stealthy” tracking
techniques. Third, although a small number of trackers stand
out
these trackers are not yet
dominating the market. The top 10 email trackers are used
by 31.8% of the online domains, generating 12% of the
tracking emails. This is different from web tracking where
one dominating tracker (i.e., Google) can track user visits of
80% of the online services [31].
Contributions.
Our work makes three key contributions.
• First, we perform the ﬁrst measurement study on dispos-
able email services by collecting a large-scale dataset (2.3
million emails) from 7 popular services over 3 months.
• Second, our analysis provides new insights into the com-
mon use cases of disposable email services and uncovers
the potential risks of certain types of usage.
• Third, we use the large-scale email dataset to empirically
measure email tracking in the wild. We show the stealthy
tracking methods used by third-party trackers collect data
on user identiﬁers and user actions.
II. BACKGROUND
A. Disposable Email Services
Disposable email services are online web services where
users can obtain a temporary email address to receive (or
send) emails. After a short usage, the email address and its
messages will be disposed by the service provider. Dispos-
able email services allow users to register an online account
without giving away their real email addresses. This helps to

disconnect the user’s online activities from her real identity,
and avoid attracting spam emails to the real email accounts.
There are two types of disposable email services, based on
how temporal email addresses are assigned (Figure 1).
• User-speciﬁed Addresses (UA). Most services allow users
to specify the username they want to use. For example, a
user can obtain a temporary address “PI:EMAIL” by
specifying a username “david”. The user-speciﬁed address
is more memorable for users.
• Randomly-assigned Addresses (RA). Some services cre-
ate temporal email addresses for users by randomly gen-
erating usernames. For example, a user may be assigned
to a random address that looks like “PI:EMAIL”.
Users may refresh the web page to receive a different
random address each time.
While disposable email services allow users to temporarily use
an email address, this email address and the received messages
are not necessarily “private”. More speciﬁcally, most dispos-
able email services are considered to be public email gateways,
which means any users can see other users’ temporary inbox.
For example, if a user A is using PI:EMAIL at this
moment, then another user B may also access the inbox of
PI:EMAIL at the same time. Very few disposable email
services have implemented the sandbox mechanisms to isolate
each temporary inbox. The only service we ﬁnd that maintains
a private inbox is inboxbear.com, which distinguishes
each inbox based on the browser cookie. Therefore, many
disposable email services have made it clear on their websites
(or Terms of Services) that the email inbox is public and users
should not expect privacy [6], [5].
B. Email Tracking
Email tracking is a method that allows the sender to know
whether an email is opened by the receiver. A common method
is to embed a small image (e.g., a 1×1 pixel) in the message
body. When the receiver reads the email, the image will be
automatically loaded by sending an HTTP or HTTPS request
to a remote server. The remote server can be either the original
email sender or a third-party service. In this way, the remote
server will know when (based on timestamp) and where (based
on IP) the email is read by which person (based on email
address) using what device (based on “User-Agent”).
Email
tracking is part of the broader category of web
tracking. Web tracking, typically through third-party cookies
and browser ﬁngerprints, has been extensively studied [15],
[29], [34], [43], [12], [46], [48], [28], [19], [9], [10], [18],
[38]. However, very few studies have systematically examined
email tracking because real-world email datasets are rarely
available to researchers. The largest measurement study so

far [17] collected data by signing up for “Shopping” and
“News” websites to receive their emails. The resulting dataset
contains 902 email senders. The limited number and category
of online services severely limit researchers’ ability to draw
generalizable conclusions.
We believe that the disposable email services provide a
unique opportunity to study email tracking at a much larger
scale and uncover new tracking techniques in the wild. First,
disposable email services are public, which allows us to
collect emails sent to disposable email addresses. Second,
users of disposable email services have broadly exposed the
email addresses to the Internet (by registering various online
accounts), which helps to attract emails from a wide range
of online services (and spammers). The resulting data, even
though still has biases, is likely to be much more diversiﬁed.
III. DATA COLLECTION
To understand how disposable email services are used, we
collect emails that are sent to disposable addresses. First,
we describe our data collection process. We then present a
preliminary analysis of the dataset. Finally, we discuss the
active steps we take to ensure research ethics.
A. Data Crawling Methodology
Since disposable email addresses are public gateways, our
method is to set up a list of disposable email addresses and
monitor the incoming emails. In this paper, we primarily
focus on user-speciﬁed addresses for data collection efﬁciency.
We select a list of “popular” usernames which increases our
chance to receive incoming emails. In order to increase our
chance of receiving incoming emails, we select a list of “high
frequency” usernames. Disposable email addresses under such
usernames are often used by multiple users at the same time.
In comparison, monitoring randomly-assigned (RA) addresses
did not return many incoming emails. For example, in a pilot
test, we monitored 5 RA email services (eyepaste.com,
getnada.com, mailto.space, mytemp.email, and
tempmailaddress.com) for 5 days. We only succeeded in
collecting data from getnada.com and all inboxes in other
RA services were empty. In total, we scanned 194,054 RA
addresses, and collected 1,431 messages from 1,430 inboxes
(a hit rate of 0.74%). The reason for the low hit rate is that
randomly-assigned addresses come from a much larger address
space than user-speciﬁed ones. Accordingly, in this paper, we
focus on user-speciﬁed addresses for data collection.
Selecting Disposable Email Services.
We spent a few
days searching online for “disposable email” and “temporary
email” to ﬁnd popular services. This process mimics how
normal users would discover disposable email services. By
examining the top 100 entries of the searching results, we ﬁnd
31 disposable email services (19 UA and 12 RA services1).
UA services are typically more popular than RA services. For
example, the top 5 sites have 4 UA services and 1 RA service.
1Two of the RA services have adopted CAPTCHAs for their sites.
As discussed above, we focus the on services that offer user-
speciﬁed addresses (UA), and select the top 7 disposable email
services as shown in Table II. These services are very popular.
For example, guerrillamail.com self-reported that they have
processed nearly 8 billion emails in the past decade. mailne-
sia.com self-reported that they received 146k emails per day.
While most of these services only provide the functionality of
receiving emails, a few (e.g., guerrillamail.com) also
provide the functionality of sending emails. In this work, we
only focus on the incoming emails received by the disposable
email addresses (to analyze email tracking).
Selecting Popular Usernames.
We construct a list of
popular usernames to set up disposable email addresses. To
do so, we analyze 10 large leaked databases (that contain
email addresses) from LinkedIn, Myspace, Zoosk, Last.fm,
Mate1.com, Neopets.com, Twitter, 000webhost.com, Gmail,
Xsplit. These databases are publicly available and have been
widely used for password research [56], [16], [30], [52],
[55], [57], [51]. By combining the 10 databases, we obtain
430,145,229 unique email addresses and 349,553,965 unique
usernames. We select the top 10,000 most popular usernames
for our data collection. The top 5 usernames are info, john,
admin, mail, and david, where “info” and “david”
have been used 800,000 and 86,000 times, respectively.
To conﬁrm that popular usernames are more likely to receive
emails, we perform a quick pilot test. We scan all 7 disposable
email services, and examine how many addresses under the
10,000 most popular usernames contain incoming emails.
From a one-time scan, we ﬁnd that 8.74% of the popular
usernames contain emails at the moment we checked the inbox.
As a comparison, we scan a list of random 10,000 usernames
and found that only about 1% of addresses contain emails,
which conﬁrms our intuition.
Time Interval for Crawling.
For each disposable email
service, we build a crawler to periodically check the email
addresses under the top 10,000 usernames. To minimize the
impact on the target service, we carefully control the crawling
speed and force the crawler to pause for 1 second between two
consecutive requests. In addition, we keep a single crawling
thread for each service. Under this setting, it would take
more than 6 hours to scan all 10K addresses. Considering
that certain disposable email services would frequently dispose
incoming emails, our strategy is to have an early timeout.
Suppose a service keeps an email for t hours, we design our
crawler to stop the current scan once we hit the t-hour mark,
and immediately start from the top of the username list. This
strategy is to make sure we don’t miss incoming emails to
the most popular addresses. Since emails are more likely to
hit the top addresses, this strategy allows us to collect more
emails with the limited crawling speed.
To set up the early-timeout, we need to measure the email
deletion time for each service. We perform a simple experi-
ment: for each service, we ﬁrst generate 25 random MD5 hash
strings as usernames. This is to make sure these addresses are
not accidentally accessed by other users during the experiment.

Then, we send 25 emails in 5 batches (12 hours apart). In
the meantime, we have a script that constantly monitors each
inbox to record the message deletion time. In this way, we
obtain 25 measurements for each disposable email service.
As shown in Table I, disposable email services often
don’t delete emails as quickly as promised. For example,
mailfall.com claimed to delete emails in 25 minutes
but in actuality, held all the emails for 30 days. Similarly
temp-mail.org claimed to delete emails in 25 minutes but
kept the emails for 3 hours. This could be an implementation
error of the developers or a false advertisement by the service.
Many of the services claim that the expiration time is not ﬁxed
(which depends on their available storage and email volume).
