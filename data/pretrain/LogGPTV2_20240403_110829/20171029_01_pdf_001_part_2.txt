◮ Prune child tables faster than PG 9.6
◮ Perform executor-stage partition pruning
◮ Move updated rows that no longer match the partition
constraints (it errors instead)
◮ Perform parallel partition processing
9/20
3. Crash-Safe, Faster, and Replicated Hash Indexes
Hash indexes is now a first-class feature:
◮ Crash safe
◮ Replicated
◮ Reduced locking during bucket splits
◮ Faster lookups
◮ More even index growth
◮ Single-page pruning
10/20
4. ICU Library
◮ Uses ICU library instead of OS-supplied internationalization
library
◮ Allows detection of collation changes that can affect index
ordering
◮ Enabled via configure --with-icu

5. Quorum Commit
◮ synchronous_standby_names = FIRST 1 (s1, s2) continues when
the first active standby replies (pre-10 behavior)
◮ Now synchronous_standby_names = ANY 1 (s1, s2) continues
when the any server from the list replies
◮ synchronous_standby_names = ANY 2 (s1, s2, s3) is also
possible
◮ Called quorum commit

6. Progress on Parallelism
Parallelism is now supported in:
◮ Btree index scans
◮ Bitmap heap scans
◮ Merge joins
◮ Procedural languages
13/20
7. Multi-Column Statistics
◮ Previously, WHERE a=1 AND b=1 multiplied the probabilities of
the two columns, assuming they were unrelated
◮ Now CREATE STATISTICS … WITH (dependencies) records
multi-column correlation
◮ The correlation is used when combining single-column
probabilities

8. pg_stat_activity Improvements
◮ Additional wait tracking
◮ clientreads,writes
◮ serverreads,writes,fsyncs
◮ synchronous replication
◮ Additional process display
◮ auxiliaryprocesses
◮ workerprocesses
◮ WALsenders

pg_stat_activity Example
SELECT wait_event_type, wait_event, count(*)
FROM pg_stat_activity
WHERE backend_type = ’client backend’
GROUP BY wait_event_type, wait_event
ORDER BY 1, 2;
wait_event_type | wait_event | count
-----------------+---------------+-------
Client | ClientRead | 2
IO | DataFileWrite | 1
Lock | transactionid | 3
LWLock | WALWriteLock | 19
| | 8

9. SCRAM-SHA-256 Authentication
SCRAM-SHA-256 provides a more secure password
authentication method than MD5:
◮ Make packet replay more difficult (MD5 has a 50%
probability of repeating after 64k connections)
◮ Make stolen hashed password reuse more difficult
◮ Make brute-force attacks more difficult
17/20
10. FDW Aggregate Pushdown
SQL Queries
PG FDW
SQL Queries with:
joins (9.6)
aggregates (10)
sorts (9.6)
Foreign Server Foreign Server Foreign Server
18/20
11. More
◮ Restrictive row-level security policies, provides AND/required
policies
◮ AFTER trigger transition tables
◮ Full text search support for JSON and JSONB
◮ Default permissions on schemas
◮ Multiple libpq-specified host names, plus write-mode filter
