Abstract—This paper systematizes and contextualizes the ex-
isting body of knowledge on technology’s dual nature regarding
sexual abuse: facilitator of it and assistant to its prevention,
reporting, and restriction. By reviewing 224 research papers, we
identiﬁed 10 characteristics of technology that facilitate sexual
abuse: covertness, publicness, anonymity, evolution, boundless-
ness, reproducibility, accessibility, indispensability, malleability,
and opaqueness. We also analyzed how technology assists victims
and other stakeholders in coping with and responding to sexual
abuse. Our research questions examined the challenges in using
technology to address sexual abuse too. For instance, its use
by victims can lead to revictimization. To address technology’s
challenges, we offer recommendations and suggest new research
directions. These ﬁndings about the dual nature of technology
can inform research and development toward better support for
victims of sexual abuse.
I. INTRODUCTION
Sexual abuse is prevalent and destructive. One in every six
American women and one in thirty-three American men are
victims of an attempted or completed rape [1]. In Canada, one
in three women will be sexually abused in their lifetime [2].
Sexual abuse violates a person’s safety and privacy, and
has long-term consequences, such as anxiety, depression, and
suicide [3], [4].
The COVID-19 pandemic impacts the domain of sexual
abuse in two major ways. First, sexual abuse has risen sig-
niﬁcantly during the pandemic [5]–[7]. Second, the pandemic
also has accelerated the adoption of technology [8], [9]. Social
distancing and national lockdowns have meant victims of sex-
ual abuse have turned to technology for support, connection,
community, and services. Unfortunately, abusers also have
rapidly adopted this use of technology, amplifying the risks
for victims. Since victims’ reliance on technology is expected
to continue beyond the pandemic, technological solutions are
increasingly needed to connect them to services and to prevent,
restrict, and report sexual abuse [10]–[12].
There is a need to understand how technology can be used to
support victims without facilitating further abuse or increasing
the risk of revictimization [13]. To better assist victims,
the current gaps and challenges surrounding technological
solutions must be understood because of the dual nature of
technology in harm facilitation and harm reduction.
To this end, our aim was to provide a systematization of
knowledge (SoK) on this dual use of technology. Our three
research questions were: (i) What qualities of digital technolo-
gies might enable abusers to conduct sexual abuse more easily?
(ii) What qualities of digital technologies might help address
sexual abuse at the individual, organizational, and societal
levels? (iii) What are the challenges with using technology to
address sexual abuse? Answering these questions would help
us identify the challenges in providing technological support
to victims of sexual abuse.
We addressed our questions by conducting a literature
review of 224 research papers. The selected papers discussed
either how technology facilitates sexual abuse or how technol-
ogy assists victims in preventing or reporting it. We analyzed
the papers using a method proposed by Wolfswinkel et al. [14]
Our study has ﬁve major contributions: (i) We perform
the ﬁrst systematic review of knowledge on the dual nature
of technology in both facilitating sexual abuse and assisting
its victims. (ii) We identify 10 characteristics of technology
that facilitate sexual abuse (covertness, publicness, anonymity,
evolution, boundlessness, reproducibility, accessibility, indis-
pensability, malleability, and opaqueness), and we analyze how
these attributes facilitate the abuse of victims. (iii) We identify
how technology assists victims and group the assistance into
three categories (investigating, reporting or preventing, and
restricting abuse). (iv) We offer the ﬁrst-of-its-kind analysis
of the challenges in using technology to provide much-needed
support for victims of sexual abuse. Some of these challenges
are related to a speciﬁc characteristic of the technology. For
instance, the reproducibility aspect leads to the duplication
of sexual content online. There are also other challenges not
linked with any particular characteristic. For example, techno-
logical solutions for reporting or preventing abuse are poorly
designed and maintained because of a lack of continuous
funding or revenue. (v) We further discuss research ideas and
solutions that can help navigate these gaps. We are optimistic
these ﬁndings could lead to the development of better solutions
for supporting victims of sexual abuse.
II. DEFINITION OF TERMS
For the sake of clarity, we have deﬁned the following terms:
Technology: A collection of systems “that allow users to
exchange digital information over networks” [15]. We use
technology as an umbrella term for all mobile, web-based, and
Internet-enabled services, platforms, applications, and devices.
Sexual abuse: “Unlawful sexual activity and sexual inter-
course carried out forcibly, or under threat of injury or with
a person who is ... incapable of valid consent” [16]. We treat
sexual assault and rape as particular types of sexual abuse. We

also use the term abuse for sexual abuse when the context is
clear.
Perpetrator: “A person who carries out a harmful, illegal,
or immoral act” [17]. Although there are different
types
of perpetrators, such as sexual perpetrators (rape, assault),
perpetrators of economic fraud (sextortion) or perpetrators in
the context of intimate partner violence (IPV) there is often
crossover and even if they operate in distinctive ways, they
are often conﬂated in the context of sexual abuse and are also
referred to more generically as abusers. For reasons explained
at the beginning of §IV, we have done the same. We use
perpetrator and abuser interchangeably.
Victim: A person who has been sexually abused. We use
the term victim in this paper; survivor can also be used. We
acknowledge victims could be stakeholders, but we give them
a separate category because of victims’ importance.
Target: The person(s) a perpetrator aims to abuse sexually.
Stakeholders: The persons or organizations with a vested
interest in supporting victims of sexual abuse. We use stake-
holders to refer to frontline community agencies, law en-
forcement, and others providing economic, ﬁnancial, or legal
services for victims. (See also “victim.”)
Revictimization: A victim’s reliving of their sexual abuse
either physically, emotionally, or psychologically.
III. METHOD
We used a ﬁve-step iterative process proposed by Wolf-
swinkel et al. to review the literature for our systematization
of knowledge (SoK). Several peer-reviewed papers have used
this method in their SoK [18]–[23]. This approach allowed us
to reach a “thorough and theoretical analysis” of our topic and
provide insights grounded in the literature [14]. The ﬁve-step
iterative process itemized by Wolfswinkel et al. is (a) deﬁne,
(b) search, (c) select, (d) analyze, and (e) present. We repeated
between the steps as needed, since the process is meant to be
iterative [14].
A. Deﬁne
In this step, we deﬁned the scope of our literature review:
Inclusion criteria: For a paper to be included, it would have
to satisfy all of the following criteria: (i) be a peer-reviewed
journal article, conference or workshop paper, or book chapter;
(ii) discuss sexual abuse; and (iii) discuss the use of technology
to facilitate, report, or prevent sexual abuse.
Exclusion criteria: We would exclude papers that discussed
sexual harassment (i.e., making rude, sexually degrading, or
offensive remarks or gestures), not sexual abuse.
Selected source/database: We chose Google Scholar
(scholar.google.com) as our source for papers because it
provides a broad coverage of research topics [24]–[27].
Speciﬁc search terms: We would search using either the
term technology or social media and combine it with each
of the following: sexual assault, intimate partner violence,
IPV, human trafﬁcking, abuse. For example, technology human
trafﬁcking, social media sexual abuse.
B. Search
Using Google Scholar, we searched for papers using the
terms we deﬁned during the previous step.
While searching, we realized from the title(s) and abstract(s)
of our results that we may unintentionally be omitting other
relevant papers if we used only the search terms deﬁned
initially. Therefore, we went back to the previous step and
added the following search terms: social networks, child
abuse, domestic violence, intimate partner abuse, technology-
facilitated abuse, sexual crime, sexual violence, COVID-19
sexual abuse, perpetrators, sexual abusers, rape, rapists, smart
devices sexual abuse.
Two researchers conducted this step independently, identi-
fying a total of 258 papers.
C. Select
The aim of this step was to check if the papers identiﬁed in
the search (i.e., those found using the search terms) satisﬁed
the inclusion criteria speciﬁed initially. For all of the papers
identiﬁed during the search, we did the following review:
Citations: We checked forward and backward citations to
see if any of the papers cited met our criteria. Through this
process, we added 154 new papers, resulting in a total of 412
papers.
Duplication: We then ﬁltered out duplicates (e.g., almost
exactly the same paper but one version was published for a
workshop, the other at a conference). After purging duplicates,
we were left with 321 unique papers.
Criteria: We then read the full text of each paper in our
dataset to determine if it met the inclusion and exclusion
criteria. As a result, 91 papers were removed, leaving us with
230 papers.
Technological relevance: Of the 230 papers, 6 papers were
from 1994–2004. After reading them, we decided to remove
them because the type of technological tools described in the
papers were no longer relevant (for instance, [28]). We ended
up with 224 papers that we could use in this research, all
published from 2005 to January 2021.
Two coauthors were involved in the ﬁrst three steps. All
authors were involved in the last step.
D. Analyze
During this step, we analyzed the papers in the selected sam-
