**Abstract:**
This paper systematizes and contextualizes the existing body of knowledge on the dual nature of technology in sexual abuse: as a facilitator of abuse and as an assistant in its prevention, reporting, and restriction. By reviewing 224 research papers, we identified ten characteristics of technology that facilitate sexual abuse: covertness, publicness, anonymity, evolution, boundlessness, reproducibility, accessibility, indispensability, malleability, and opaqueness. We also analyzed how technology assists victims and other stakeholders in coping with and responding to sexual abuse. Our research questions examined the challenges in using technology to address sexual abuse. For instance, its use by victims can lead to revictimization. To address these challenges, we offer recommendations and suggest new research directions. These findings about the dual nature of technology can inform research and development toward better support for victims of sexual abuse.

**I. Introduction**
Sexual abuse is a prevalent and destructive issue. One in every six American women and one in thirty-three American men are victims of attempted or completed rape [1]. In Canada, one in three women will experience sexual abuse in their lifetime [2]. Sexual abuse violates a person's safety and privacy, leading to long-term consequences such as anxiety, depression, and suicide [3], [4].

The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the domain of sexual abuse in two major ways. First, there has been a significant rise in sexual abuse during the pandemic [5]–[7]. Second, the pandemic has accelerated the adoption of technology [8], [9]. Social distancing and national lockdowns have led victims to turn to technology for support, connection, community, and services. Unfortunately, abusers have also rapidly adopted this use of technology, amplifying the risks for victims. As victims' reliance on technology is expected to continue beyond the pandemic, technological solutions are increasingly needed to connect them to services and to prevent, restrict, and report sexual abuse [10]–[12].

There is a need to understand how technology can be used to support victims without facilitating further abuse or increasing the risk of revictimization [13]. To better assist victims, the current gaps and challenges surrounding technological solutions must be understood, given the dual nature of technology in harm facilitation and harm reduction.

To this end, our aim was to provide a systematization of knowledge (SoK) on this dual use of technology. Our three research questions were:
1. What qualities of digital technologies might enable abusers to conduct sexual abuse more easily?
2. What qualities of digital technologies might help address sexual abuse at the individual, organizational, and societal levels?
3. What are the challenges with using technology to address sexual abuse?

Answering these questions would help us identify the challenges in providing technological support to victims of sexual abuse.

We addressed our questions by conducting a literature review of 224 research papers. The selected papers discussed either how technology facilitates sexual abuse or how technology assists victims in preventing or reporting it. We analyzed the papers using a method proposed by Wolfswinkel et al. [14].

Our study makes five major contributions:
1. We perform the first systematic review of knowledge on the dual nature of technology in both facilitating sexual abuse and assisting its victims.
2. We identify ten characteristics of technology that facilitate sexual abuse (covertness, publicness, anonymity, evolution, boundlessness, reproducibility, accessibility, indispensability, malleability, and opaqueness), and analyze how these attributes facilitate the abuse of victims.
3. We identify how technology assists victims and group the assistance into three categories: investigating, reporting or preventing, and restricting abuse.
4. We offer the first-of-its-kind analysis of the challenges in using technology to provide much-needed support for victims of sexual abuse. Some of these challenges are related to specific characteristics of the technology. For example, the reproducibility aspect leads to the duplication of sexual content online. Other challenges are not linked to any particular characteristic, such as poorly designed and maintained technological solutions for reporting or preventing abuse due to a lack of continuous funding or revenue.
5. We discuss research ideas and solutions that can help navigate these gaps. We are optimistic that these findings could lead to the development of better solutions for supporting victims of sexual abuse.

**II. Definition of Terms**
For clarity, we define the following terms:
- **Technology**: A collection of systems that allow users to exchange digital information over networks [15]. We use technology as an umbrella term for all mobile, web-based, and Internet-enabled services, platforms, applications, and devices.
- **Sexual abuse**: Unlawful sexual activity and sexual intercourse carried out forcibly, or under threat of injury, or with a person who is incapable of valid consent [16]. We treat sexual assault and rape as particular types of sexual abuse. We also use the term "abuse" for sexual abuse when the context is clear.
- **Perpetrator**: A person who carries out a harmful, illegal, or immoral act [17]. Although there are different types of perpetrators, such as sexual perpetrators (rape, assault), perpetrators of economic fraud (sextortion), or perpetrators in the context of intimate partner violence (IPV), they are often conflated in the context of sexual abuse and are referred to more generically as abusers. We use "perpetrator" and "abuser" interchangeably.
- **Victim**: A person who has been sexually abused. We use the term "victim" in this paper; "survivor" can also be used. We acknowledge that victims could be stakeholders, but we give them a separate category due to their importance.
- **Target**: The person(s) a perpetrator aims to abuse sexually.
- **Stakeholders**: Persons or organizations with a vested interest in supporting victims of sexual abuse. We use "stakeholders" to refer to frontline community agencies, law enforcement, and others providing economic, financial, or legal services for victims. (See also "victim.")
- **Revictimization**: A victim's reliving of their sexual abuse, either physically, emotionally, or psychologically.

**III. Method**
We used a five-step iterative process proposed by Wolfswinkel et al. to review the literature for our systematization of knowledge (SoK). This approach allowed us to reach a thorough and theoretical analysis of our topic and provide insights grounded in the literature [14]. The five-step iterative process is: (a) define, (b) search, (c) select, (d) analyze, and (e) present. We repeated between the steps as needed, since the process is meant to be iterative [14].

**A. Define**
In this step, we defined the scope of our literature review:
- **Inclusion criteria**: Papers had to be peer-reviewed journal articles, conference or workshop papers, or book chapters, discuss sexual abuse, and discuss the use of technology to facilitate, report, or prevent sexual abuse.
- **Exclusion criteria**: Papers discussing sexual harassment (i.e., making rude, sexually degrading, or offensive remarks or gestures) were excluded.
- **Selected source/database**: We chose Google Scholar (scholar.google.com) as our source for papers because it provides broad coverage of research topics [24]–[27].
- **Specific search terms**: We searched using the terms "technology" or "social media" combined with each of the following: "sexual assault," "intimate partner violence," "IPV," "human trafficking," "abuse." For example, "technology human trafficking," "social media sexual abuse."

**B. Search**
Using Google Scholar, we searched for papers using the terms defined in the previous step. During the search, we realized from the titles and abstracts of our results that we might be omitting relevant papers. Therefore, we added the following search terms: "social networks," "child abuse," "domestic violence," "intimate partner abuse," "technology-facilitated abuse," "sexual crime," "sexual violence," "COVID-19 sexual abuse," "perpetrators," "sexual abusers," "rape," "rapists," "smart devices sexual abuse."

Two researchers conducted this step independently, identifying a total of 258 papers.

**C. Select**
The aim of this step was to check if the papers identified in the search met the inclusion criteria. For all the papers identified, we did the following:
- **Citations**: We checked forward and backward citations to see if any of the papers cited met our criteria. Through this process, we added 154 new papers, resulting in a total of 412 papers.
- **Duplication**: We filtered out duplicates, leaving us with 321 unique papers.
- **Criteria**: We read the full text of each paper to determine if it met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. As a result, 91 papers were removed, leaving us with 230 papers.
- **Technological relevance**: Of the 230 papers, 6 were from 1994–2004. After reading them, we decided to remove them because the type of technological tools described were no longer relevant. We ended up with 224 papers, all published from 2005 to January 2021.

Two coauthors were involved in the first three steps. All authors were involved in the last step.

**D. Analyze**
During this step, we analyzed the papers in the selected sample.
