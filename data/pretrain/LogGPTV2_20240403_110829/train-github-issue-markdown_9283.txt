Subject: Tooltip Placement Update in Version 2.3.0

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I hope this message finds you well.

In version 2.3.0, the tooltip placement has been updated. Now, tooltips can only be positioned at the top of elements. Previously, they could be placed on all sides (top, right, bottom, left).

For more details, please refer to the official documentation:
