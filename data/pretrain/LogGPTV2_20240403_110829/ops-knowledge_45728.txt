User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题I'm an IT consultant. Should I discourage a client from telling me his password? I'm an IT consultant. One client has known me for a few years. He wants me to do some work on his kids' laptop again. I'll need to log into his kids' Windows user account. (I'm guessing that multiple kids share one account.)

This time, he wants to drop the machine off with me. He'll want to tell me the kids' password ("plan A"): he trusts me. But I don't want him to get in the habit of insecure practices like sharing passwords with IT consultants.

I could propose and push a "plan B":


He changes the kids' password to a new, temporary password.
I log in, do the work, then force a password change at next logon.


Or I could push him to make me an account so that I can follow a "plan C":


I reset the kids' password.
I log in, do the work, then force a password change at next logon.


Still, I want to keep him happy, and I don't want him to waste time or money. I don't want to push him towards plan B or plan C unless absolutely necessary. I wonder:


Is it really so bad for him to just tell me the kids' password? If it's bad, please explain why, and please cite a source if you can.
(Optional:) I always tell customers a per-hour rate. But lately, I've been billing by the minute. If we choose plan C, is it ethical for me to bill him for the extra minutes it will take me?

Assistant: The problem isn't with this situation in particular. Let's assess the situation here:


You're a trustworthy person to them
The password is very likely securing trivial data


Giving you the password isn't that big of a deal in this case. The problem (like you stated in your question) is that getting him in the habit of giving out passwords.

I'd definitely go with plan B. Why?


It's the best compromise between security and convenience in this case.
It'll teach him about not sharing password, especially if the lesson is coming from a trustworthy person to him.
It'll make you look even more professional and shows your interest in your client's security.
You don't know, he might spread the word about this situation and in a way you'd be contributing to a better understanding of security (in this kind of situations) in his circle of friends/family.


As for your second question, I don't think I'm the best person to answer this, but I'd say no. If something takes you 2-3 minutes and it's obviously trivial compared to another task (fixing whatever is wrong with the computer) don't actually bill the client for the extra 3 minutes of work. It makes nobody look good.
