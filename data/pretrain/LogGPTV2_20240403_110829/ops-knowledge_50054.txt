User: What is virtualization technology? Why is it widely used in the IT field?
Assistant: Virtualization technology is a technology that divides actual computer hardware and software resources into multiple virtual computers. That is to say, through virtualization technology, one computer can run multiple operating systems at the same time, or multiple application programs can run in the same operating system at the same time, so as to maximize the utilization of computer resources. The reason why virtualization technology is widely used in the IT field is that it can improve the utilization rate of computer resources and reduce resource costs. Through virtualization technology, users can run multiple operating systems on the same physical computer at the same time, thereby achieving the purpose of saving hardware costs; at the same time, realizing resource sharing and automatic management, reducing maintenance and management costs. In addition, virtualization technology can also improve the reliability and flexibility of computer systems. In a virtualized environment, virtual computers are isolated from each other, even if a problem occurs in one of the virtual computers, other virtual computers will not be affected. In addition, virtualization technology can also realize the rapid creation, replication, movement and scheduling of virtual computers, thereby improving the flexibility and scalability of the system.
