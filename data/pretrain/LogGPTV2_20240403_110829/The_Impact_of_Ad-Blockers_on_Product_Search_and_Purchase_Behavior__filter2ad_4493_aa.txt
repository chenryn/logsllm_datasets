Abstract
Ad-blocking applications have become increasingly popular
among Internet users. Ad-blockers offer various privacy- and
security-enhancing features: they can reduce personal data
collection and exposure to malicious advertising, help safe-
guard users’ decision-making autonomy, reduce users’ costs
(by increasing the speed of page loading), and improve the
browsing experience (by reducing visual clutter). On the other
hand, the online advertising industry has claimed that ads in-
crease consumers’ economic welfare by helping them ﬁnd
better, cheaper deals faster. If so, using ad-blockers would
deprive consumers of these beneﬁts. However, little is known
about the actual economic impact of ad-blockers.
We designed a lab experiment (N=212) with real economic
incentives to understand the impact of ad-blockers on con-
sumers’ product searching and purchasing behavior, and the
resulting consumer outcomes. We focus on the effects of
blocking contextual ads (ads targeted to individual, potentially
sensitive, contexts, such as search queries in a search engine
or the content of web pages) on how participants searched
for and purchased various products online, and the resulting
consumer welfare.
We ﬁnd that blocking contextual ads did not have a statisti-
cally signiﬁcant effect on the prices of products participants
chose to purchase, the time they spent searching for them, or
how satisﬁed they were with the chosen products, prices, and
perceived quality. Hence we do not reject the null hypothe-
sis that consumer behavior and outcomes stay constant when
such ads are blocked or shown. We conclude that the use
of ad-blockers does not seem to compromise consumer eco-
nomic welfare (along the metrics captured in the experiment)
in exchange for privacy and security beneﬁts. We discuss the
implications of this work in terms of end-users’ privacy, the
study’s limitations, and future work to extend these results.
1 Introduction
In recent years, online advertising and blocking of it using
dedicated tools (e.g., browser extensions and mobile apps)
have been at the center of a heated debate. The online adver-
tising industry has claimed that online ads beneﬁt all agents
in the advertising ecosystem (vendors, publishers, ad com-
panies, and consumers alike), and support the provision of
free online content and services [49]. Claimed beneﬁts range
from immediate advantages (such as matching buyers to sell-
ers, increasing companies’ revenues, and satisfying consumer
needs), to broader economic contributions (including creation
of jobs and stimulation of the economic growth in digital
sectors) [43, 47, 48].
On the consumer side, however, online ads have raised di-
verse concerns [30], including privacy and security, inducing
growing numbers of Internet users to install software blocking
online advertising [87]. Concerns relate both to the growing
exposure to large volumes of online ads and to the extensive
data collection associated, speciﬁcally, with ad targeting. For
instance, users believe that today ads are more ubiquitous
(81%) and intrusive (69%) than 3 years ago [57]. Moreover,
66% of adult Americans do not want to receive targeted ads
[105], and 61% believe free access to the websites is not worth
the privacy invasion caused by advertising targeting [80].
In response, according to a recent survey [34], Internet
users deploy ad-blockers to stop compromises of their online
privacy; to avoid too many or intrusive ads, some of which
contain bugs and viruses jeopardising security; to prevent cus-
tomization based on browsing history; and to increase brows-
ing performance in terms of screen space, loading speed, and
consumption of data and battery. Ad-blockers have become
increasingly popular consumer tools to address different di-
mensions of privacy concerns. First, some ad-blockers address
concerns associated with privacy and security by curtailing
online tracking and malware [97] and other security threats
posed by malicious advertising [68, 113], thus helping protect
user privacy [33]. Second, by reducing the exposure to ads,
ad-blockers address broader concerns related to the protection
of users’ decision-making autonomy, choice and control over
browsing experience, and improvement in such experience
(via the reduction of visual clutter and of distraction of at-
tention, and increased speed of page loading). Indeed, users

believe that ad-blockers protect from intrusion, interruption
of attention, and offensive or inappropriate content of ads
[42]. In this regard, ad-blockers ameliorate privacy deﬁned in
terms of private sphere, inviolate personality, and autonomous
decision making [11, 22, 83, 108].
The growing popularity of ad-blockers among consumers
has been met with anxiety, and even hostility, by online adver-
tising companies and online publishers [38]. Industry fears
have been supported by some recent studies: researchers have
used industry data to estimate online publishers’ revenue
losses due to ad-blockers, and concluded that “ad-blocking
poses a substantial threat to the ad-supported web” [94].
Very little is known, however, about the impact of ad-
blockers on the economic-relevant behavior and welfare of
consumers, and on product searching and purchasing, specif-
ically. Therefore, some of the advertising industry’s claims
about how consumers beneﬁt from online ads (such as match-
ing buyers to sellers and satisfying consumer needs) have been
neither conﬁrmed nor disproved by the empirical evidence.
We conducted a lab experiment with real economic incen-
tives to address this gap in the literature. We investigated the
effects of blocking ads on individuals’ online product search-
ing and purchasing behavior, and the resulting outcomes.
We focus on contextual ads—ads that are targeted to in-
dividual, potentially sensitive, contexts related to consumer
interests, but not relying on consumers’ past online behav-
iors (i.e., behaviorally targeted ads). For instance, contextual
search ads (also known as sponsored search results) are tar-
geted to a search query chosen by the consumer when looking
for information or a product online; and contextual display
ads can be targeted to the content of a web page visited by
the user. As such, our results and discussion focus on one
speciﬁc set of claims regarding the value of online ads (those
pertaining to direct economic consequences for consumers,
rather than claimed macroeconomic effects such as the sup-
port of free content), and on a speciﬁc family of targeted ads
(primarily contextual ads on sponsored search results in a
speciﬁc search engine, Google, and, to a smaller extent, on
vendors’ landing pages).1
Experimental participants (N=212) were invited to search
for products online and purchase them using their credit
cards. They were randomly assigned to experimental con-
ditions in which ads were displayed, or blocked. We cap-
tured the impact of showing or blocking ads on participants’
purchase decisions—in particular, on the price of the prod-

allow us to control for potential confounding factors and obtain internally
valid, conservative estimates of the effects of that speciﬁc type of advertising.
Capturing the effects of behaviorally targeted ads would likely require much
larger sample sizes and different experimental designs, due to the challenges
of developing realistic online consumer proﬁles for behavioral targeting in a
lab setting, and controlling for the larger set of factors behavioral targeting
relies on (e.g., idiosyncratic online behaviors, user proﬁles, device speciﬁca-
tions). In future ﬁeld experiments we plan to explore the effects of eliminating
behaviorally targeted ads, and of displaying non-targeted ads.
ucts they searched for. In addition, and based on research
on the psychological and cognitive effects of advertising
[40, 51, 52, 54, 107], we captured how showing or blocking
ads impacts participants’ search costs (time spent on search-
ing) and satisfaction with their browsing experience and prod-
uct choices.
We ﬁnd that the removal of contextual ads using ad-
blockers did not have a statistically signiﬁcant effect on how
much participants chose to pay for the products, how much
time they spent searching for them, or how satisﬁed they were
with the chosen products, prices, and perceived quality. In
essence: we do not reject the null hypothesis that consumer
welfare stays constant when ads are blocked or are shown.
Thus, we do not ﬁnd evidence that the use of ad-blockers
against contextual ads compromises consumer welfare, along
the metrics captured in our study, in exchange for privacy and
security beneﬁts.
2 Related Work and Hypotheses
2.1 Ad-blockers
In recent years, ad-blockers have become increasingly popular
tools of digital self-defense. The global number of consumers
adopting technologies to block ads had reached 615 million in
December 2016 [87]. The growth in ad-blockers’ popularity
has likely been fueled by Internet users’ resistance to increas-
ing amounts of invasive ads and the associated tracking of
personal data.
Ad-blockers are third-party tools that users can install on
their machines to block ads from appearing in the browsers.
Most ad-blockers are able to block multiple types of ads—
including search ads appearing as sponsored search results
on search engines and display ads appearing on other sites.
Numerous researchers have investigated the technical perfor-
mance of ad-blockers [81, 95], and have demonstrated that
ad-blockers are highly effective in eliminating online ads and
limiting web tracking [5, 28, 50, 72, 74, 75, 109], and in reduc-
ing energy consumption on smartphones [20, 79, 92] and lap-
tops [96]. As discussed in §1, users often deploy ad-blockers
to counter privacy and security concerns. When conﬁgured
properly, ad-blockers are shown to be effective in protecting
some aspects of user privacy and security [33].
A few user studies on ad-blockers have primarily focused
on the usability of these tools [64]. Pujol et al. [91] found that
the majority of the users of a popular ad-blocker, AdBlock
Plus, did not opt out from a default list of “non intrusive ads,”
and did not enable the ﬁlter that blocks web trackers. Similarly,
another popular ad-blocker, Ghostery, does not protect from
privacy risks with its default settings [33]. One study [77]
investigated the effect of ad-blockers on user engagement
with the Internet. That study, however, used observational data
(compared to experimental data in our study), and focused on
browsing (not on online shopping) behaviors.

In summary, while a few studies have explored the privacy
implications of online advertising tracking [114] or the eco-
nomic impact of fraudulent ads on the companies’ revenues
[98], and have quantiﬁed ad-blockers’ privacy implications
[33, 109], none have estimated the impact on ad-blocker users’
economic welfare and satisfaction. To our knowledge, our
study—investigating the impact of ad-blockers on actual Inter-
net users’ purchasing behavior, outcomes, and satisfaction—is
the ﬁrst to attempt to bridge the gaps in the existing research
on ad-blockers’ technical aspects of security, human factors,
economic impact, and privacy implications. How end-users
react to the usage of ad-blockers (and, therefore, to the pres-
ence or absence of online ads) is critical to the analysis of
industry claims on the negative effects of ad-blockers, and to
the understanding of the broader effects of ad-blocking on the
society.
2.2 The impact of online advertising
Internet advertising is a popular business model among online
publishers and a fast-growing sector of the global economy.
Online advertising revenues reached USD 48 billion in Eu-
rope and USD 88 billion in the U.S. in 2017 [44, 45]. How-
ever, on the consumer side, the proliferation of online ads has
caused growing dissatisfaction and adoption of ad-blockers.
Users report blocking online advertising because they ﬁnd
ads excessive (48%), annoying and irrelevant (47%), intrusive
(44%) and personalized based on browsing history (20%),
sometimes containing bugs and viruses (39%), occupying
too much screen space (37%), decreasing page loading speed
(33%), and compromising online privacy (25%) [34]. Thus,
targeting is one of the users’ concerns with online ads, but
not the only or most common one.
Nevertheless, the ability to target advertising to individual
consumers is one of the crucial factors responsible for the
generation of large revenues in the online advertising mar-
ket [19, 32, 35, 36, 53, 110]. Targeting refers to advertisers’
ability to match ads to Internet users in the attempt to meet
their preferences and interests. Targeting can take place in
a number of ways, all ultimately dependent on some knowl-
edge, or inference, of users’ information or behavior. One
way is contextual targeting of ads based on the content of
that particular page, which in turn is based on generalized
and aggregated information about consumers’ preferences.
Another way is behavioral targeting based on the prediction
of consumers’ individual preferences, which are typically in-
ferred through monitoring of click-stream behavior across
multiple sites. While our analysis focuses on contextual tar-
geting, rather than behavioral, the theoretical predictions and
results of empirical research about targeted ads presented in
this section apply to both types of targeting.
Across policy and academic circles, contrasting proposi-
tions have been offered regarding the effects of online ad-
vertising (including targeted advertising) on the welfare of
different stakeholders (consumers, online publishers, adver-
tising vendors, and data companies). One the one hand, some
studies show a positive impact of targeting on advertising cam-
paigns’ effectiveness, such as click-through and conversion
rates, website visits, and sales [19, 32, 35, 36, 53, 110]. On
the other hand, other researchers (and even some advertisers
[101]) argue that the effect of targeted ads on consumers’ like-
lihood to purchase may be overestimated due to “activity bias”
[67], and methodological issues [32, 66, 85] such as large
conﬁdence intervals and (sometimes) absence of comparisons
with a randomly selected control group. Some evidence sug-
gests a limited technological efﬁciency in correctly targeting
consumers based on their behaviors [46, 58, 73].
Users express privacy concerns regarding targeted advertis-
ing [30, 65, 70, 80, 105, 106]. From the economic perspective,
targeting is claimed, on the one hand, to decrease search costs
[18, 27, 86], but on the other hand, to potentially reduce con-
sumer surplus (which is absorbed by the advertisers) through
application of price and offer discrimination [2, 23, 76, 88].2
While focused on the business outcomes, those studies did
not consider the implications for consumers’ welfare.
Our study attempts to address a gap in the literature on
ad-blockers and online advertising. Previous behavioral work
on ad-blockers has focused on their usability [64, 91], and
effectiveness and performance [33]. Previous studies on on-
line ads (e.g., [66, 111]) have also typically focused on ad
“effectiveness,” which is captured through click-through rates
or conversion metrics. Those studies often rely on rich ﬁeld
data, but are focused on consumers’ response to a speciﬁc ad
campaign (or a set of ad campaigns). Our experiment goes
in a subtly but importantly different (and somewhat more
expansive) direction: it is designed to track participants’ be-
havior across an array of search results and vendor sites, thus
capturing their response to the presence or absence of an ar-
ray of ad campaigns from different vendors. In so doing, the
study attempts to investigate a critical counterfactual currently
underexplored in the literature: what happens (to consumer
behavior, to their choices, and to their economic outcomes)
when certain ads are blocked? Rather than investigating on-
line ads’ effectiveness by testing whether a consumer will
click on a certain ad or end up buying through it, we investi-
gate broader consumer behavior in the presence and absence
of contextual ads.
2.3 Hypotheses
Theoretical and practical research has offered contrasting
claims, predictions, and evidence regarding the impact of
advertising on search costs in terms of time, prices paid for a
product, and satisfaction. Accordingly, hypotheses about the
effect of ad-blocking on those variables are mixed.
2The actual prevalence of ﬁrst degree price discrimination on the Internet
is the object of some debate [84].

Search time. While advocates of the informative role of
advertising argue that advertising reduces consumers’ search
costs and therefore search time [18, 86, 99], some empirical
evidence shows that advertising may increase search time
due to distraction, information overload, and increased cog-
nitive effort [37, 40, 51, 52, 107]. Speciﬁcally, eye-tracking
data showed that online banner ads decreased visual search
speed [16]. Additionally, ad-blockers may increase web page
