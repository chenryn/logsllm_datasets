OK. The glow text example I gave that's currently inside the code (but unused)
isn't great.
I've received feedback from @MilesMSCohen that it has a fundamental flaw:
  * It loses all font hinting which makes it hard to read, especially at small sizes.
Ouch. I want hinting. The recommended alternative is to render the text to a
command list and use the command list as input to an effect that can cause a
glow.
@DHowett-MSFT already had a sample lump of code to do something like this that
he was playing around with a few weeks ago because glow text is cool. It's
around here somewhere.
Also, I got the warning from @MilesMSCohen that this might have worse
performance, but we'd have to decide if that's worth it.
