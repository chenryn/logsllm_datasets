**Description:**
I am encountering an issue with the "Add a Submit Button to a Form" challenge in the Waypoint. The problem seems to be related to the form not functioning as expected.

**Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Navigate to the "Add a Submit Button to a Form" challenge.
2. Use the following code in the challenge editor:

   ```html
   <h1>CatPhotoApp</h1>
   <a href="#">Click here for cat photos.</a>
   <h2>Things cats love:</h2>
   <ul>
     <li>cat nip</li>
     <li>laser pointers</li>
     <li>lasagna</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Top 3 things cats hate:</h2>
   <ol>
     <li>flea treatment</li>
     <li>thunder</li>
     <li>other cats</li>
   </ol>
   ```

3. Add a form element and a submit button to the code. For example:

   ```html
   <form action="/submit-cat-photo">
     <button type="submit">Submit Cat Photo</button>
   </form>
   ```

4. Save the changes and test the form by clicking the submit button.

**Expected Behavior:**
- The form should submit successfully and redirect to the specified action URL or trigger the expected behavior defined in the challenge.

**Actual Behavior:**
- [Describe what actually happens when you click the submit button. For example, does nothing happen, or is there an error message?]

**Screenshots:**
- [If possible, include links to screenshots that illustrate the issue. For example, a screenshot of the form before and after clicking the submit button.]

**Additional Information:**
- [Any other relevant information, such as browser console errors, or any steps you have already taken to troubleshoot the issue.]
