### Maintenance Index (MI) Formula
The Maintenance Index (MI) is defined as:
\[ \text{MI} = 171 - 5.2 \ln(V) - 0.23M - 16.2 \ln(\text{SLOC}) \]
where:
- \( V \) is Halstead's average volume per module, a classic complexity metric (see [21] for details).
- \( M \) is the average cyclomatic complexity per module.
- SLOC is the average number of source code lines per module.

This formula, used in Visual Studio, does not consider the comment-to-code ratio as the original one proposed in [30]. Similar to the COCOMO estimators, Oman and Hagemeister derived this formula through statistical regression over a large dataset of software projects tagged with expert opinions. The MI has been included in Visual Studio since 2007 and is also part of the JSComplexity and Radon metrics for JavaScript and Python. Although it has faced some criticism, the Software Engineering Institute recommended it in their "C4 Software Technology Reference Guide" [33] as a potentially good predictor of maintainability. There are no universally agreed-upon safe limits for the MI, but Visual Studio flags modules with an MI < 20 as suspicious.

### Dataset
Our work is based on a dataset of malware source code collected by the authors over several months in 2015. Collecting malware source code is challenging because malware is typically released in binary form. Source code is only occasionally released or leaked, and its availability is biased towards classical viruses and early specimens. When leaked, the source code may be difficult to access in underground forums. These challenges make it impossible to achieve completeness. Our goal was to collect representative examples of the malware ecosystem over the past 30+ years, given the limited availability.

Samples were obtained from various sources, including virus collection sites like VX Heaven, code repositories such as GitHub, classical e-zines published by historically prominent malware writing groups like 29A, various malware exchange forums, and P2P networks. We expanded our list of sources using a snowballing methodology, exploring previously unknown sources referenced in sites under examination.

### Initial Collection and Verification
Our initial collection contained 210 different samples of malware source code. Each sample was first quickly verified through manual inspection and then compiled, executed, and functionally tested whenever possible. Approximately 30% of the obtained samples were discarded at this point, either due to unfeasible testing (e.g., nontrivial compilation errors or lack of a proper testing environment) or because they turned out to be fake.
