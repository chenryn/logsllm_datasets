### Performance Improvements with DNS-over-Encryption

Other tests, such as Mozilla's study on DoH [62], have also reported potential performance improvements when using DNS-over-Encryption. Their hypotheses include better service consistency and the use of modern HTTP features like loss recovery and congestion control, which enhance operational efficiency. We speculate that these improvements could also be attributed to anycast or different routing paths for queries, as well as varying latencies between resolvers and nameservers in different regions [59].

### 5. Usage: DNS-over-Encryption Traffic

For the DNS community, it is essential to understand the role and impact of DNS-over-Encryption within the contemporary DNS ecosystem, including trends and characteristics of its real-world traffic. This understanding will help in driving future deployment and usage of DNS-over-Encryption. In this section, we analyze its current usage using several large-scale passive traffic datasets.

#### 5.1 Methodology

**Observing DoT Traffic:**
DoT (DNS-over-TLS) typically uses port 853, making it distinguishable from other traffic. We used an 18-month NetFlow dataset (July 2017 to January 2019) collected by the backbone routers of a large Chinese ISP. NetFlow-enabled routers aggregate sequential packets in a flow (i.e., packets with the same transfer protocol, IP addresses, and ports) and create a record containing their statistics. Each NetFlow record includes IP addresses, ports, total bytes of packets, and the union of TCP flags. Our provider ISP used a sampling rate of 1/3,000 and expired flows if they were idle for 15 seconds.

To begin our analysis, we selected all NetFlow records over TCP port 853 and excluded flows that only contained a single SYN flag. We then matched the destination address with the DoT resolver list created in Section 3. If a flow was sent by a client to TCP port 853 of a DoT resolver, it was considered DoT traffic. For ethical considerations, we retained only the /24 of each client IP address before further processing and analysis.

**Observing DoH Traffic:**
DoH (DNS-over-HTTPS) queries are mixed with HTTPS traffic, making it infeasible to observe them directly from traffic datasets like NetFlow. However, the URI template of a DoH service contains a domain that must be resolved before DoH lookups (e.g., dns.example.com, see Section 2). This allows us to evaluate DoH usage by checking the query volumes of resolver domain names in passive DNS datasets.

**Passive DNS Datasets:**
We used two large passive DNS datasets: DNSDB [22] maintained by Farsight Security and 360 PassiveDNS [16] maintained by Qihoo 360. Both datasets provide aggregated statistics for given domains, including timestamps of first and last queries and the number of historical lookups. While DNSDB has a wider global coverage, 360 PassiveDNS provides more fine-grained statistics, such as daily query volume per domain. We leveraged DNSDB to study the scale of lookups for DoH domains and 360 PassiveDNS to investigate their query trends over time.

**Limitations:**
Our passive datasets inevitably contain geographical bias. Directly collected DNS-over-Encryption resolver traffic would allow for more fine-grained and systematic analysis, but we currently do not have access to such data. Additionally, due to DNS caching, we may underestimate the query volume of DoH domains from passive DNS datasets. Nonetheless, these datasets still provide valuable insights into the current trends of DoH usage.

#### 5.2 DoT Traffic

**Key Observation 4:**
Although still at a small scale compared to traditional DNS, real-world traffic to DNS-over-Encryption services is observed, reflecting a growing usage in recent months.

**Finding 4.1:**
DoT traffic to large public resolvers is still at a small scale, primarily originating from centralized clients and temporary users. From our NetFlow dataset, we only observed traffic to large public DoT resolvers (e.g., Cloudflare and Quad9), but the amount is still small compared to traditional DNS. Notably, the traffic does not originate from automated scanners.

Figure 11 shows the monthly count of bidirectional flows to Cloudflare and Quad9 DNS. The amount of DoT traffic is significantly smaller (about 2-3 orders of magnitude less) than traditional DNS under the same sampling rate. We also observed an increase in traffic to Cloudflare DoT, which grew by 56% from July 2018 (4,674 flows recorded) to December 2018 (7,318 flows recorded), while traffic to Quad9 DoT fluctuated.

**Client Distribution:**
Several networks account for a significant proportion of DoT traffic. Among all 5,623 /24 netblocks sending DoT traffic to the Cloudflare resolver, the top five netblocks accounted for 44% of all DoT traffic, and the top 20 accounted for 60%. As shown in Figure 12, the active time (i.e., the number of days we observed DoT traffic from a network) of large client networks tends to be several weeks or months long. Conversely, we also noticed a number of temporary users: 5,416 (96%) netblocks were only active for less than one week, generating 25% of all observed DoT traffic.

To verify whether the observed DoT traffic came from automated scanners, we submitted all client networks to NetworkScan Mon [20] and checked their behaviors. Developed and maintained by 360 Netlab, this system detects scan behaviors based on real-time traffic statistics and state transition models. It has been effective in quickly reporting attacks, including Mirai, IoT Reaper, and Hajime botnet [65]. We did not receive any alerts related to port-853 scanning activities. As a complement, we also checked the SOA and PTR records of the client addresses and found no indications of scanning experiments. Therefore, we conclude that the DoT traffic observed in our NetFlow dataset is not generated by automated scanners.

**Network Ownership:**
Of the top 10 networks, 69 belong to ISPs, and the remaining one is owned by a cloud platform. We speculate that the reasons for their large ratio include: 1) DoT is less popular in other networks, and 2) the observed addresses under the two netblocks are associated with proxy or NAT.

#### 5.3 DoH Traffic

**Finding 4.2:**
Large providers dominate all DoH services, and their usage is growing. According to DNSDB, among the 17 public DoH resolvers we discovered (15 in [73] and 2 beyond, see Section 3), only 4 domains have more than 10K queries. Since the rest of the resolvers do not witness much traffic, we focused on the query trend of the 4 popular DoH resolvers (i.e., Cloudflare, Google, CleanBrowsing, and crypto.sx).

Figure 13 shows the monthly query volume of the 4 popular DoH domains, according to 360 PassiveDNS. Google DoH, the most popular DoH resolver with the longest history (since 2016), receives several orders of magnitude more queries than other domain names. Cloudflare’s DoH also receives significant traffic, thanks to Firefox support and recent DoH tests on Firefox Nightly [62]. The query volumes of the DoH resolvers have all shown growth. For example, the query volume of CleanBrowsing DoH increased nearly 10 times from September 2018 (200 queries recorded) to March 2019 (1,915 queries recorded).

### 6. Discussion

**Recommendations:**
To advance the development and deployment of DNS-over-Encryption, efforts from all parties in the Internet ecosystem are required. Protocol designers should reuse well-developed protocols to encrypt DNS messages, ensuring new protocols are widely supported and implemented. DNS service providers should promote their services, correct misconfigurations, and maintain their services carefully and regularly. They should also use resolver addresses with a clean history. For DNS clients, education is necessary to help them understand the benefits of encrypting their DNS queries.

**Dataset and Code Release:**
We release our source code and collected datasets at https://dnsencryption.info. We believe our dataset release will be helpful for further studies.

### 7. Related Work

**DNS Privacy Threats:**
The lack of encryption and authentication in DNS is widely seen as one of the Internet’s biggest unpatched vulnerabilities. Unencrypted DNS queries are vulnerable to various attacks, including eavesdropping and manipulation. Previous studies have shown that DNS queries and logs can be used to accurately fingerprint client machines and even identify users [32, 48, 54, 55, 72]. On-path attackers can build profiles for each client and track them across the Internet from DNS queries [52].

Because DNS lacks authentication, adversaries can manipulate unprotected DNS traffic. Transparent proxies can spoof the IP addresses of user-specified resolvers and intercept DNS queries [60]. Adversaries can also build rogue DNS servers to return malicious responses, launch attacks, or redirect traffic for illegal monetization [35, 57, 78]. Attackers can build fake DNS root servers to hijack all DNS root traffic [26], motivated by malware distribution, censorship, ad injection [57], and performance improvement [26].

**Improving DNS Privacy:**
The DNS community has been discussing DNS privacy threats [29]. To add confidentiality to traditional DNS, DNS-over-TLS [49] and DNS-over-HTTPS [50] have been standardized, offering both encryption and authentication. Techniques like QNAME minimization [30] also aim to eliminate privacy data in DNS packets. Significant efforts have been devoted to pushing forward the deployment of DNS-over-Encryption. Before the standards, [79] presented a performance evaluation of encrypted DNS (T-DNS), concluding that it only introduces a modest cost with careful implementation. [71] performed traffic analysis to distinguish webpages from encrypted DNS traffic. Cloudflare, as a DNS service provider, measures and tries to fix the global reachability to its public resolvers [74]. The DNSPrivacy Project [37] has gathered the latest updates on DNS-over-Encryption and conducted studies on their implementations.

Compared to previous research, our work presents the first systematic and large-scale study on the evolution of DNS-over-Encryption techniques, providing a comprehensive understanding of the DNS ecosystem.

### 8. Conclusion

To address DNS privacy concerns, various protocols have been proposed to encrypt and secure DNS transactions. In this paper, we conducted the first systematic and large-scale measurement study on the ecosystem of DNS-over-Encryption. Our study shows that the two recently standardized protocols, DoT and DoH, offer promising global reachability, minor performance overhead, and growing usage. We provide recommendations for the DNS community to advance the future deployment of DNS-over-Encryption and release our collected datasets. Our findings highlight the need for service providers to re-evaluate their implementations and encourage more Internet users to use DNS-over-Encryption to secure their DNS queries.

### Appendix

**A. Current Implementations of DNS-over-Encryption Protocols**

We provide an extensive survey on current implementations of DNS-over-Encryption protocols in Table 8. DNS-over-DTLS and DNS-over-QUIC are not included, as we did not find any implementations yet.

Compared to DNSSEC (a widely-deployed security extension standardized in 2005) and QNAME Minimization (standardized in 2016), we find that DoT (standardized in 2016) and DoH (standardized in 2018) are quickly gaining support from large DNS service providers and software vendors.
