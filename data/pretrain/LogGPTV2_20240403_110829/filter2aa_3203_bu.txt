### Detection and Configuration of Group Policy Changes

The Winlogon service polls for changes in Group Policy by default every 90 minutes. 

### IPsec Policy: General Tab
Figure 13-5 illustrates the General tab for the default Server (Request Security) IPsec policy.

**Figure 13-5: General tab of the properties of an IPsec policy**

### Key Exchange Settings
By clicking on the "Settings" button, you can configure the following:

- **Key Exchange Settings**: These settings determine how new keys are derived and how often they are renewed.
- **Key Exchange Methods**: These methods protect identities during the key exchange process.

The default key exchange settings and methods are designed to work for most IPsec deployments. Unless you have specific security requirements, it is generally not necessary to change these defaults.

### IPsec Rules
An IPsec policy consists of one or more rules that dictate IPsec behavior. You configure these rules on the "Rules" tab in the properties of an IPsec policy. For each rule, you can configure the following:

- **Filter List**: Specifies a single filter list containing one or more predefined packet filters that describe the types of traffic to which the configured filter action applies.
- **Filter Action**: Specifies a single filter action, which includes the type of action (permit, block, or secure) for packets that match the filter list. For the "secure" filter action, the negotiation data includes one or more security methods used during IKE negotiations and other IPsec settings. Each security method determines the security protocol (e.g., AH or ESP), cryptographic algorithms, and session key regeneration settings.
- **Authentication Methods**: Configures one or more authentication methods (in order of preference) for authenticating IPsec peers during main mode negotiations. You can specify the Kerberos V5 protocol, use of a certificate from a specified certification authority, or a preshared key.
- **Tunnel Endpoint**: Specifies whether the traffic uses tunnel mode and, if so, the IP address of the tunnel endpoint. For outbound traffic, this is the IP address of the IPsec tunnel peer. For inbound traffic, it is a local IP address.
- **Connection Type**: Specifies whether the rule applies to local area network (LAN) connections, dial-up connections, or both.

**Figure 13-7: Properties of an IPsec rule**

### Rule Order and IPsec Filters
Rules in a policy appear in reverse alphabetical order based on the name of the filter list selected for each rule. You cannot specify the order in which to apply the rules. The Windows implementation of IPsec automatically derives a set of IPsec filters that specify IP traffic and the corresponding action. These filters are ordered from the most specific to the least specific IP traffic.

### Default Response Rule
The default response rule, applicable to all policies, has an IP filter list and a filter action of "Default Response" when viewed with IP Security Policies. This rule cannot be deleted but can be deactivated. It is active for all default policies and can be enabled when creating IPsec policies.

The default response rule ensures that the computer responds to requests for protected communication. If an active policy does not have a rule defined for a requesting computer, the default response rule is applied, and protection is negotiated. For example, if Computer A communicates with Computer B and Computer B lacks an inbound filter for Computer A, the default response rule is used.

You can configure authentication methods and the connection type for the default response rule. The filter list indicates that the filter list is not configured, but filters are created automatically when IKE negotiation packets are received. The filter action of "Default Response" means you cannot configure the action (permit, block, or negotiate security). However, you can configure:

- **Security Methods and Preference Order**: Configure these settings by obtaining the properties of the IPsec policy, navigating to the "Rules" tab, selecting the default response rule, clicking "Edit," and then the "Security Methods" tab.
- **Authentication Methods and Preference Order**: Configure these settings by selecting the default response rule, clicking "Edit," and then the "Authentication Methods" tab.

### Filter List
An IP filter list triggers a filter action based on a match with the source, destination, and type of IP traffic. This allows a network administrator to precisely define what IP traffic to allow, block, or protect. Each IP filter list contains one or more filters, which define IP addresses and traffic types. You can use one IP filter list for multiple types of IP traffic.

For protected packets, IPsec requires you to configure both inbound and outbound filters between the computers specified in the filter list. Inbound filters apply to incoming traffic, enabling the receiving computer to respond to requests for protected communication or to match traffic against the IP filter list. Outbound filters apply to traffic leaving a computer, triggering a security negotiation before traffic is sent.

For example, if Computer A wants to exchange protected data with Computer B:
- The active IPsec policy on Computer A must have a filter that specifies any outbound packets to Computer B.
- The active IPsec policy on Computer A must have a filter that specifies any inbound packets from Computer B.
- The active IPsec policy on Computer B must have a filter that specifies any inbound packets from Computer A.
- The active IPsec policy on Computer B must have a filter that specifies any outbound packets to Computer A.

### Filter Settings
Each filter defines a particular subset of inbound or outbound network traffic. A filter can include the following settings:
- **Source and Destination Address**: You can configure any IP address assigned to the IPsec peer, a single IP address, IP addresses by DNS name, or address ranges to specify IP subnets.
- **Protocol**: By default, this setting covers all protocols in the TCP/IP protocol suite, but you can configure it for individual protocols.
- **Source and Destination Port**: By default, all TCP and UDP ports are covered, but you can configure the filter to apply to specific ports.

**Figure 13-8: An example IP filter list**

### Filter Action
A filter action defines how the Windows implementation of IPsec treats IP traffic. Figure 13-9 shows the "Require Security" filter action for the default Server (Request Security) IPsec policy.

**Figure 13-9: An IPsec filter action**

You can configure a filter action to:
- **Permit Traffic**: The Windows implementation of IPsec forwards the traffic without modification or protection. This is appropriate for traffic from specific computers that cannot support IPsec.
- **Block Traffic**: IPsec silently discards the traffic.
- **Negotiate IPsec**: IPsec requires the sender and receiver to negotiate SAs and to send and receive IPsec-protected traffic. After choosing to negotiate IPsec, you can also:
  - Specify security methods and their order.
  - Allow initial incoming unprotected traffic (the "Accept unsecured communication, but always respond using IPsec" setting).
  - Enable communication with computers on which IPsec is not enabled (the "Allow unsecured communication with non-IPsec-aware computer" setting).
  - Generate session keys from new keying material (the "Session key perfect forward secrecy (PFS)" setting).

### IPsec Security Methods
Each security method defines the security requirements for any communications to which the associated rule applies. Creating multiple security methods increases the likelihood of finding a common method between two computers. The IKE component reads the list of security methods in descending order and sends a list of allowed methods to the other peer. The first common method is selected.

Predefined security methods include:
- **Encryption and Integrity**: Uses ESP to provide data confidentiality, integrity, and authentication, with default key lifetimes (100MB, 1 hour).
- **Integrity Only**: Uses ESP to provide data integrity and authentication, with default key lifetimes (100MB, 1 hour).

**Figure 13-10: The New Security Method tab**

### Custom Security Methods
If the predefined methods do not meet your security requirements, you can specify custom security methods. When configuring a custom method, you can specify:
- **Security Protocols**: Enable both AH and ESP for IP header integrity and data encryption.
- **Integrity Algorithm**
- **Encryption Algorithm**
- **Session Key Settings**: Determine when a new key is generated, with options for lifetime in kilobytes, seconds, or both.

**Figure 13-11: The Custom Security Methods dialog box**

### Authentication
Each IPsec rule defines a list of authentication methods, and each method defines the requirements for verifying identities in protected communications. The two peers must have at least one common authentication method, or communication will fail. IPsec supports the following authentication methods:
- **Kerberos V5**: The default method for clients running the Kerberos V5 protocol and members of the same or trusted Active Directory domains.
- **Public Key Certificate**: Suitable for Internet access, remote corporate resource access, and communications with external business partners.
- **Preshared Key**: A simple method involving a shared, secret key, suitable for computers not running the Kerberos V5 protocol or without public key certificates.

### Tunnel Endpoint
IPsec tunnels help protect entire IP packets. You configure the tunnel to protect traffic between two IP addresses or two IP subnets. If you configure the tunnel between two computers instead of two routers, the IP address outside the AH or ESP payload is the same as the IP address inside the payload.

To create a layer 3 tunnel using IPsec, configure and enable the following rules:
1. **Outbound Traffic Through the Tunnel**: Configure the rule with a filter list and a tunnel endpoint (IP address of the IPsec tunnel peer).
2. **Inbound Traffic Through the Tunnel**: Configure the rule with a filter list and a tunnel endpoint (local IP address).

For each rule, specify filter actions, authentication methods, and other settings.

### Connection Type
For each IPsec rule, define the connection types to which the rule will apply. The connection types include all connections in Network Connections on the computer for which you are configuring IPsec policy.

- **All Network Connections**: The rule applies to communications sent through any network connection.
