Rules 
An IPsec policy consists of one or more rules that determine IPsec behavior. You configure IPsec rules 
on the Rules tab in the properties of an IPsec policy. For each IPsec rule, you can configure the 
following items: 
Filter list  
You specify a single filter list that contains one or more predefined packet filters that describe the 
types of traffic to which the configured filter action for this rule is applied.  
Filter action  
You specify a single filter action that includes the type of action required (permit, block, or secure) 
for packets that match the filter list. For the secure filter action, the negotiation data contains one or 
more security methods that are used (in order of preference) during IKE negotiations and other 
IPsec settings. Each security method determines the security protocol (such as AH or ESP), the 
specific cryptographic algorithms, and the settings for regenerating session keys used.  
Authentication methods  
You configure one or more authentication methods (in order of preference) for authenticating IPsec 
peers during main mode negotiations. You can specify the Kerberos V5 protocol, use of a certificate 
issued from a specified certification authority, or a preshared key. 
Tunnel endpoint  
You can specify whether the traffic is using tunnel mode and, if so, the IP address of the tunnel 
endpoint. For outbound traffic, the tunnel endpoint is the IP address of the IPsec tunnel peer. For 
inbound traffic, the tunnel endpoint is a local IP address.  
Connection type 
You can specify whether the rule applies to local area network (LAN) connections, dial-up 
connections, or both.  
Figure 13-7 shows the properties of a rule for the default Server (Request Security) IPsec policy.

Figure 13-7  Properties of an IPsec rule 
The rules for a policy appear in reverse alphabetical order based on the name of the filter list selected 
for each rule. You cannot specify an order in which to apply the rules in a policy. The Windows 
implementation of IPsec automatically derives a set of IPsec filters that specify IP traffic and the action 
that IPsec has been configured to take for the traffic. IPsec filters are ordered based on the most 
specific to the least specific IP traffic. For example, an IPsec filter that specifies individual IP addresses 
and TCP ports is ordered before an IPsec filter that specifies all addresses on a subnet. 
Default Response Rule 
The default response rule, which can be used for all policies, has the IP filter list of  and the 
filter action of Default Response when the list of rules is viewed with IP Security Policies. You cannot 
delete the default response rule, but you can deactivate it. It is activated for all of the default policies, 
and you can enable it when you create IPsec policies.  
The default response rule ensures that the computer responds to requests for protected 
communication. If an active policy does not have a rule defined for a computer that is requesting 
protected communication, the default response rule is applied, and protection is negotiated. For 
example, the default response rule is used when Computer A communicates with protection with 
Computer B and Computer B does not have an inbound filter defined for Computer A.  
You can configure authentication methods and the connection type for the default response rule. The 
filter list of  indicates that the filter list is not configured, but filters are created automatically 
when IKE negotiation packets are received. The filter action of Default Response indicates that you 
cannot configure the action of the filter (permit, block, or negotiate security). However, you can 
configure:  
The security methods and their preference order. To configure these settings, obtain properties on the 
IPsec policy, click the Rules tab, click the default response rule, click Edit, and then click the Security 
Methods tab.  
The authentication methods and their preference order. To configure these settings, click the default 
response rule, click Edit, and click the Authentication Methods tab.  
Filter List 
An IP filter list triggers a filter action based on a match with the source, destination, and type of IP 
traffic. This type of IP packet filtering enables a network administrator to precisely define what IP traffic 
to allow, block, or protect. Each IP filter list contains one or more filters, which define IP addresses and 
traffic types. You can use one IP filter list for multiple types of IP traffic. 
For protected packets, IPsec requires you to configure both an inbound and outbound filter between the 
computers specified in the filter list. Inbound filters apply to incoming traffic, enabling the receiving 
computer to respond to requests for protected communication or to match traffic against the IP filter list. 
Outbound filters apply to traffic leaving a computer toward a destination, triggering a security 
negotiation that takes place before traffic is sent. For example, if Computer A wants to exchange 
protected data with Computer B: 
The active IPsec policy on Computer A must have a filter that specifies any outbound packets to 
Computer B.   
Chapter 13 – Internet Protocol Security and Packet Filtering 
TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows  
Page: 377 
The active IPsec policy on Computer A must have a filter that specifies any inbound packets from 
Computer B.  
Each peer must also have the reverse filter. For example: 
The active IPsec policy on Computer B must have a filter that specifies any inbound packets from 
Computer A.  
The active IPsec policy on Computer B must have a filter that specifies any outbound packets to 
Computer A.  
Filter Settings 
Each filter defines a particular subset of inbound or outbound network traffic. You must have a filter to 
cover any traffic to which the associated rule applies. A filter can contain the following settings: 
The source and destination address of the IP packet. You can configure any IP address assigned to the 
IPsec peer, a single IP address, IP addresses by DNS name, or address ranges to specify IP subnets.  
The protocol over which the packet is being transferred. This setting by default covers all protocols in 
the TCP/IP protocol suite. However, you can configure the filter for an individual protocol to meet 
special requirements, including custom protocols.  
For TCP and UDP, the source and destination port of the protocol. By default, all TCP and UDP ports 
are covered, but you can configure the filter to apply to only a specific TCP or UDP port.  
Figure 13-8 shows the All ICMP Traffic filter list for the default Server (Request Security) IPsec 
policy. 
Figure 13-8  An example IP filter list 
Filter Action 
A filter action defines how the Windows implementation of IPsec must treat IP traffic. Figure 13-9 shows 
the Require Security filter action for the default Server (Request Security) IPsec policy. 
Chapter 13 – Internet Protocol Security and Packet Filtering 
TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows  
Page: 378 
Figure 13-9  An IPsec filter action 
You can configure a filter action to: 
Permit traffic (the Permit setting)  
The Windows implementation of IPsec forwards the traffic without modification or protection. This 
setting is appropriate for traffic from specific computers that cannot support IPsec. 
Block traffic (the Block setting)  
IPsec silently discards this traffic. 
Negotiate IPsec (the Negotiate Security setting)  
IPsec requires the sender and receiver to negotiate SAs and to send and receive IPsec-protected 
traffic. After you choose to negotiate IPsec, you can also do the following:  
Specify security methods and their order  
Allow initial incoming unprotected traffic (the Accept unsecured communication, but always 
respond using IPsec setting)  
If you configure this setting, IPsec allows an incoming packet that matches the configured filter 
list to be unprotected by IPsec. However, the outgoing response to the incoming packet must 
be protected. This behavior is also known as inbound pass-through. 
This setting is useful when you are using the default response rule for clients. For example, a 
group of servers are configured with a rule that protects communications with any IP address, 
accepts communication that is not protected, and responds with only protected 
communications. To ensure that the clients will respond to the server request to negotiate 
security, you must enable the default response rule on client computers.   
Enable communication with computers on which IPsec is not enabled (the Allow unsecured 
communication with non-IPsec-aware computer setting)  
If you configure this setting, IPsec falls back to unprotected communication, if necessary. This 
behavior is known as fallback to clear. 
Chapter 13 – Internet Protocol Security and Packet Filtering 
TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows  
Page: 379 
You can use this setting to allow communication with computers that cannot initiate IPsec, such 
as computers running Microsoft operating systems older than Windows 2000. 
Generate session keys from new keying material (the Session key perfect forward secrecy 
(PFS) setting)  
This setting determines whether a new session key can be derived from existing material for 
keying a master key determined from a main mode negotiation. By enabling session key PFS, 
you ensure that master key keying material cannot be used to derive more than one session 
key. When session key PFS is enabled, a new Diffie-Hellman key exchange is performed to 
generate new master key keying material before the new session key is created. Session key 
PFS does not require main mode reauthentication and uses fewer resources than master key 
PFS.  
IPsec Security Methods 
Each security method defines the security requirements of any communications to which the associated 
rule applies. By creating multiple security methods, you increase the chance that a common method 
can be found between two computers. The IKE component reads the list of security methods in 
descending order and sends a list of allowed security methods to the other peer. The first method in 
common is selected. Typically, the methods with the most cryptographic strength are at the top of the 
list and the methods with the least cryptographic strength are at the bottom of the list. 
The following security methods are predefined: 
Encryption and integrity  Uses ESP to provide data confidentiality (encryption), data integrity and data 
origin authentication, and default key lifetimes (100MB, 1 hour). If you require both data and addressing 
(IP header) protection, you can create a custom security method. If you do not require encryption, you 
can use Integrity only. 
Integrity only  Uses ESP to provide data integrity and authentication and default key lifetimes (100MB, 
1 hour). In this configuration, ESP does not provide data confidentiality (encryption). This method is 
appropriate when your security plan calls for standard levels of security.  
Figure 13-10 shows the New Security Method tab, which appears when you add a security method to 
a filter action. 
Chapter 13 – Internet Protocol Security and Packet Filtering 
TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows  
Page: 380 
Figure 13-10  The New Security Method tab 
Custom Security Methods 
If the predefined Encryption and integrity or Integrity only settings do not meet your security 
requirements, you can specify custom security methods. For example, you can use custom methods to 
specify encryption and address integrity, stronger algorithms, or key lifetimes.  
When you configure a custom security method, you can specify the following: 
Security protocols   
You can enable both AH and ESP in a custom security method when you require IP header 
integrity and data encryption. If you chose to enable both, you do not need to specify an integrity 
algorithm for ESP. The algorithm that you select for AH provides integrity. 
Integrity algorithm  
Encryption algorithm  
Session key settings  
Session key settings determine when a new key is generated, rather than how it is generated. You 
can specify a lifetime in kilobytes, seconds, or both. For example, if the communication takes 
10,000 seconds and you specify the key lifetime as 1000 seconds, 10 keys will be generated to 
complete the transfer. This approach ensures that, even if an attacker manages to determine one 
session key and decipher part of a communication, deciphering the entire communication is not 
possible. By default, new session keys are generated for every 100 MB of data transferred or every 
hour. 
Figure 13-11 shows the Custom Security Method Settings dialog box, which appears when you add 
a custom security method to a filter action.

Authentication 
Each IPsec rule defines a list of authentication methods. Each authentication method defines the 
requirements for how identities are verified in protected communications to which the associated rule 
applies. The two peers must have at least one authentication method in common or communication will 
fail. By creating multiple authentication methods, you increase the chance that the two computers can 
find a common method.  
Only one authentication method can be used between a pair of computers, regardless of how many you 
configure. If you have multiple rules that apply to the same pair of computers, you must configure the 
authentication methods lists in those rules to enable the pair to use the same method. For example, 
authentication will fail if a rule between a pair of computers specifies only Kerberos for authentication 
and filters only TCP data and another rule specifies only certificates for authentication and filters only 
UDP data.  
IPsec supports the following authentication methods: 
Kerberos V5  The Kerberos V5 security protocol is the default authentication method for clients that are 
running the Kerberos V5 protocol and that are members of the same or trusted Active Directory 
domains.  
Kerberos V5 authentication is not supported on computers running Windows XP Home Edition or 
computers running any other Windows 2000, Windows XP, or Windows Server 2003 operating 
system that are not members of an Active Directory domain.  
Public key certificate  You should use a public key certificate in situations that include Internet access, 
access to corporate resources from remote locations, communications with external business partners, 
or computers that do not run the Kerberos V5 security protocol. This method requires you to obtain 
certificates from at least one trusted certification authority (CA). Computers running Windows 
Server 2003, Windows XP, or Windows 2000 support X.509 Version 3 certificates, including certificates 
generated by commercial CAs.  
Preshared key  This method involves a shared, secret key similar to a password. It is simple to use 
and does not require the client to run the Kerberos V5 protocol or have a public key certificate. Both 
parties must manually configure IPsec to use this preshared key. Preshared key is a simple method for 
Chapter 13 – Internet Protocol Security and Packet Filtering 
TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows

authenticating computers that are not running Windows Server 2003, Windows XP, or Windows 2000; 
stand-alone computers; or any computers that are not using the Kerberos V5 protocol. This key is for 
peer authentication protection only and is not used to protect the data sent between IPsec peers.  
Tunnel Endpoint 
IPsec tunnels help protect entire IP packets. You configure the tunnel to help protect traffic between 
either two IP addresses or two IP subnets. If you configure the tunnel between two computers instead 
of two routers (also known as gateways), the IP address outside the AH or ESP payload is the same as 
the IP address inside the AH or ESP payload.  
IPsec can perform layer 3 tunneling for scenarios in which Layer Two Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) cannot 
be used. You do not need to configure a tunnel if you are using L2TP for remote communications 
because the client and server virtual private networking (VPN) components of Windows automatically 
create the appropriate rules to protect L2TP traffic. 
To create a layer 3 tunnel using IPsec, use IP Security Policies or Group Policy to configure and enable 
the following two rules for the appropriate policy: 
1. A rule for outbound traffic through the tunnel.  
You configure the rule for outbound traffic with both a filter list, which describes the traffic to be sent 
across the tunnel, and a tunnel endpoint, which is an IP address assigned to the IPsec tunnel peer 
(the computer or router on the other side of the tunnel).  
2. A rule for inbound traffic through the tunnel.  
You configure the rule for inbound traffic with both a filter list, which describes the traffic to be 
received across the tunnel, and a tunnel endpoint, which is a local IP address (the computer or router 
on this side of the tunnel).  
For each rule, you must also specify filter actions, authentication methods, and other settings. 
Connection Type 
For each IPsec rule, you must define to which connection types on your computer the rule will apply. 
The connection types include all connections in Network Connections on the computer for which you 
are configuring IPsec policy. 
Each rule has one connection type setting: 
All Network Connections  The rule applies to communications sent through any network connection
