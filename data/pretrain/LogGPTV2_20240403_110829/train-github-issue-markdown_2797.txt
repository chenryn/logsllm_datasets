Certainly! Hereâ€™s a more polished and professional version of your text:

Currently, to determine the size of a widget, you need to implement the following code:

```dart
Size get _size {
  assert(mounted);
  final RenderBox box = context.findRenderObject() as RenderBox;
  assert(box != null);
  assert(box.hasSize);
  return box.size;
}
```

It would be beneficial to have this functionality as a built-in API. I find myself duplicating this code in multiple places, which is not ideal.

Additionally, it would be useful to have a similar method for obtaining the size of a widget using a `GlobalKey`. Perhaps a new method or property could be added to `GlobalKey` to facilitate this.
