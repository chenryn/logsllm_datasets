User: In the Linux system, how to set a static IP address and ensure that it is still valid after restarting?
Assistant: In the Linux system, you can set a static IP address by modifying the network configuration file, and ensure that it is still valid after restarting. The following are the specific steps: 1. Open the network configuration file, and enter the following command in the terminal: ``` sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces ``` 2. In the opened file, find the line that sets the current network card, usually ending with " auto" keyword, for example: ``` auto eth0 ``` 3. Add the following configuration items below this line to set the static IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, etc.: ``` iface eth0 inet static address 192.168 .1.100 netmask 255.255.255.0 gateway 192.168.1.1 ``` Note: The specific IP address and subnet mask need to be set according to the actual network environment. 4. Save and exit the file, and enter the following command in the terminal: ``` sudo service networking restart ``` 5. Restart the computer or network service, and confirm that the static IP address has taken effect. The above method is only applicable to Debian, Ubuntu and other Linux systems that use the ifupdown network management tool. For other systems, corresponding configurations need to be made according to the actual situation.
