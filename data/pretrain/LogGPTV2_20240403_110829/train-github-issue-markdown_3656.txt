**Using Windows 8 on a Sony Vaio S**

I am experiencing an issue with my Sony Vaio S running Windows 8. When I disable the "Num Lock" key, the Home, End, Page Up, and Page Down keys no longer function as expected. Instead, I have to use the Fn key in combination with the arrow keys to achieve the same functionality.

Could you please provide any suggestions or solutions to resolve this issue?
