http://www.celeryproject.org/ says "Celery is easy to integrate with ...
Flask, using the ... Flask-Celery add-on packages."
Meanwhile, https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Flask-Celery states in bold "FROM
CELERY 3.0 THIS LIBRARY IS NO LONGER NECESSARY, INSTEAD YOU SHOULD USE THE
STANDARD CELERY API."
So the suggestion should be removed from the Celery project homepage?
