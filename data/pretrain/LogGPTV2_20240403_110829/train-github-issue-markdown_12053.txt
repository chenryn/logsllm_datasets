Babel is already an insanely powerful tool as is, but being able to input an
AST would allow people using other AST utilities outside of Babel (e.g.
UglifyJS2) or even languages that generate ESTree ASTs (like the experimental
eslisp) to plug in the output into Babel.
As for prior art, UglifyJS2 accepts its own AST as well as the ESTree AST.
I doubt it would be hard to do this, considering this would simply skip a step
for the general algorithm ( ~~parse~~ , transform, generate).
