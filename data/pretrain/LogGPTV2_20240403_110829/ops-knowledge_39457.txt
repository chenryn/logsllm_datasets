User: I want to get the full command line as it was typed.
This:
" ".join(sys.argv[:])
doesn't work here (deletes double quotes). Also I prefer not to rejoin something that was parsed and split.
Any ideas?
Assistant: As mentioned, this probably cannot be done, at least not reliably.  In a few cases, you might be able to find a history file for the shell (e.g. - "bash", but not "tcsh") and get the user's typing from that.  I don't know how much, if any, control you have over the user's environment.
