User: Installing a new Windows system, I've installed CygWin and 64
bit Python (2.7.3) in their default locations (c:\cygwin and
c:\Python27\python), and added both the CygWin bin and the
Python directory to my path (in the user variable PATH).  From
the normal command window, Python starts up perfectly, but when
I invoke it from bash in the CygWin environment, it hangs,
never giving my the input prompt.
I've done this on other machines, previously, but always with
older versions of Python (32 bits) and CygWin, and with Python
in a decidely non-standard location.  Has anyone else had this
problem, or could someone tell me what it might be due to?
Assistant: Reinstall mintty with cygwin setup.  Didn't have to use python -i after that.
