## Solution
We visit the attached website, only to find a standard news portal with many articles. They have "Politics", "Sports", "Art", "Real Estate" - but where is the flag?
Nothing is out of the ordinary in the site. No dynamic forms, no `robots.txt`, nothing in the source code. 
Eventually, we go back to the description: "*Keep updated with our new blog*" it says. How can we do that?
Usually such sites provide an RSS feed under `/rss` or `/feed` (with and without an `.xml` extension). Trying the different possibilities, we finally find:
```console
┌──(user@kali)-[/media/sf_CTFs/bsides/News]
└─$ curl -s https://news.ctf.bsidestlv.com/rss.xml
        https://news.ctf.bsidestlv.com/rss.xml
        RSS for Node

Filtering just for the flag, we get:
```console
┌──(user@kali)-[/media/sf_CTFs/bsides/News]
└─$ curl -s https://news.ctf.bsidestlv.com/rss.xml | grep -i flag -A 3
            https://news.ctf.bsidestlv.com/Im4Fl4gS3cr3t
            https://news.ctf.bsidestlv.com/Im4Fl4gS3cr3t
--
```
We visit this URL and get the flag:
```console
