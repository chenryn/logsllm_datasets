User: I am trying to push a python3 app to Bluemix, but get the error msg "missing start command". I have tried to add -c "python appname.py" as Python usually has in Windows and -c "python3 appname.py" as in Python in Linux, but neither works for me. Can anyone give me the right start command to use?
Assistant: You can define the start command in a file called Procfile. Create the Procfile in the root of your app code that you push to Bluemix. The contents of the Procfile should look like this:
web: python3 appname.py
where appname.py is the nameof your python script to run
