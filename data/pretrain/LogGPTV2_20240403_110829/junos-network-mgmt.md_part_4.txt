### Device and Network Management Features

Juniper devices support features that allow you to manage system performance, fault monitoring, and remote access. You can use CLI operational mode commands to monitor the system health and performance of your network. Monitoring tools and commands display the current state of the device, and you can filter the output to a file. Diagnostic tools and commands test the connectivity and reachability of hosts in the network.

To use the CLI operational tools, you must have the appropriate access privileges. Table 2 on page 5 lists the network management features.

#### Table 2: Device and Network Management Features on the QFX Series, OCX Series, and EX4600 Series

### Tracing and Logging Operations

Tracing and logging operations enable you to track events that occur in the switch, including normal operations and error conditions, and to track the packets generated by or passed through the switch. The results of tracing and logging operations are placed in the `/var/log` directory on the switch.

**Remote Tracing Processes:**
- `chassisd`: Chassis-control process
- `eventd`: Event-processing process
- `cosd`: Class-of-service process

You can configure remote tracing using the `tracing` statement at the `[edit system]` hierarchy level. Note that the `tracing` statement is not supported on the QFX3000 QFabric system. You can disable remote tracing for specific processes on the switch using the `no-remote-trace` statement at the `[edit process-name traceoptions]` hierarchy level.

**Logging Operations:**
- Use the system logging mechanism similar to the UNIX `syslogd` utility to record system-wide, high-level operations, such as interfaces going up or down and users logging in or out of the switch. Configure these operations using the `syslog` statement at the `[edit system]` hierarchy level and the `options` statement at the `[edit ethernet-switching-options]` hierarchy level.

**Tracing Operations:**
- Record detailed information about the operations of the switch, including packet forwarding and routing information. Configure tracing operations using the `traceoptions` statement. Note that the `traceoptions` statement is not supported on the QFX3000 QFabric system.

**Defining Tracing Operations:**
- **SNMP agent activity tracing**: Define tracing of the activities of SNMP agents on the switch. Configure at the `[edit snmp]` hierarchy level.
- **Global switching tracing**: Define tracing for all switching operations. Configure at the `[edit ethernet-switching-options]` hierarchy level.
- **Protocol-specific tracing**: Define tracing for a specific routing protocol. Configure in the `[edit protocols]` hierarchy. Protocol-specific tracing operations override any equivalent global traceoptions.
- **Tracing within individual routing protocol entities**: Some protocols allow you to define more granular tracing operations. For example, in BGP, you can configure peer-specific tracing operations.
- **Interface tracing**: Define tracing for individual interfaces and the interface process itself. Configure at the `[edit interfaces]` hierarchy level.
- **Remote tracing**: To enable system-wide remote tracing, configure the `destination-override syslog host` statement at the `[edit system tracing]` hierarchy level. This specifies the remote host running the system log process (syslogd), which collects the traces. Traces are written to files on the remote host in accordance with the syslogd configuration in `/etc/syslog.conf`. By default, remote tracing is not configured.

**Collecting Traces:**
- Use the `local0` facility as the selector in the `/etc/syslog.conf` file on the remote host. To separate traces from various processes into different files, include the process name or trace-file name in the `Program` field in the `/etc/syslog.conf` file. If the system log server supports parsing hostname and program name, you can separate traces from the various processes.

**Commit Check Warnings:**
- During a commit check, warnings about the `traceoptions` configuration (e.g., mismatch in trace file sizes or number of trace files) are not displayed on the console but are logged in the system log messages when the new configuration is committed.

### Junos Space Support for Network Management

**Preparing the Device for Junos Space Management**

**Prerequisites:**
- Ensure the configuration on the QFX Series device meets the following requirements for device discovery in Junos Space:
  - The device configuration has a static management IP address that is reachable from the Junos Space server.
  - There is a user with full administrative privileges for Junos Space administration.
  - SNMP is enabled (only if you plan on using SNMP as part of the device discovery).
  - In Junos Space, set up a default device management interface (DMI) schema for the QFX Series device.

**Steps to Prepare the Device:**
1. Perform the initial configuration of the device through the console port using the Junos OS CLI. This task includes configuring a static management IP address and a user with root administrative privileges.
   - For the QFX3500 switch, see *Configuring a QFX3500 Device as a Standalone Switch*.
   - For the QFabric system, see *QFabric System Initial and Default Configuration Information* and *Performing the QFabric System Initial Setup on a QFX3100 Director Group*.
2. (Optional) Configure SNMP if you plan on using SNMP to probe devices during device discovery.
3. (Optional) Enable SSH if you wish to use the Secure Console feature in Junos Space. See *Connecting to a Device by Using Secure Console*.
4. In Junos Space, set up a default DMI schema. For more information about managing DMI schemas, see *Setting a Default DMI Schema*.

### J-Web Diagnostic Tools

**J-Web Diagnostic Tools:**
- Use the J-Web Diagnose options to diagnose a device. J-Web results appear in the browser.
- Use CLI operational mode commands to diagnose a device. You can view the CLI command output on the console or management device and filter the output to a file.
- To use the J-Web user interface and CLI operational tools, you must have the appropriate access privileges.

**Table 3: J-Web Interface Troubleshoot Options**

| Option | Function |
|--------|----------|
| **Ping Host** | Allows you to ping a remote host. You can configure advanced options for the ping operation. |
| **Ping MPLS** | Allows you to ping an MPLS endpoint using various options. |
| **Traceroute** | Allows you to trace a route between the device and a remote host. You can configure advanced options for the traceroute operation. |
| **Packet Capture** | Allows you to capture and analyze router control traffic. |

### CLI Diagnostic Commands

**CLI commands available in operational mode** allow you to perform the same monitoring, troubleshooting, and management tasks as the J-Web user interface. Instead of invoking the tools through a graphical interface, you use operational mode commands to perform the tasks.

**CLI command output** appears on the screen of your console or management device, or you can filter the output to a file. For operational commands that display output, such as the `show` commands, you can redirect the output into a filter or a file. When you display help about these commands, one of the options listed is `|`, called a pipe, which allows you to filter the command output.

**Example:**
- Use the `mtrace` command to display trace information about a multicast path from a source to a receiver.
- To view a list of top-level operational mode commands, type a question mark (`?`) at the command-line prompt.

**Table 4: CLI Diagnostic Command Summary**

| Command | Function |
|---------|----------|
| **Controlling the CLI Environment** | - `set option`: Configures the CLI display. |
| **Diagnosis and Troubleshooting** | - `clear`: Clears statistics and protocol database information. <br> - `mtrace`: Traces information about multicast paths from source to receiver. <br> - `monitor`: Performs real-time debugging of various Junos OS components, including... |
