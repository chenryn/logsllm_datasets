This is a very useful feature provided by Kate editor which I miss when I open
I file on Atom.  
Any chance it could be implemented?
Here is an example of how it works on Kate: suppose a file contains this
    foo bar baz
    baz foo bar
    bar baz foo
If I double click on "foo", it gets selected and then all 3 occurrences of
"foo" are highlighted. If I unselect "foo", the highlight disappears. If then
I select "bar baz", its two occurrences (on lines 1 and 3) get selected.
