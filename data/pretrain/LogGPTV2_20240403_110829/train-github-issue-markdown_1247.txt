**Symfony Version:**

**Description:**

When using the `.env` file for configuration, the type casting does not work as expected. Specifically, the `easy_admin.list.max_results` setting is supposed to be an integer, but it is being interpreted as a string.

**Error Message:**
```
Invalid type for path "easy_admin.list.max_results". Expected int, but got string.
```
