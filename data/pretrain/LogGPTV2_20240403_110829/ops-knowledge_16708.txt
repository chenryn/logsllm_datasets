Question: In the context of an iOS application security assessment, an auditor finds that an application stores sensitive user data, such as login credentials, within its 'Custom resource files' directory. Which of the following is a likely security concern that arises from this practice, and what could be a potential remedy?
"A": "Storing sensitive data in 'Custom resource files' can lead to data leakage if the files are not encrypted, and the remedy is to implement proper data encryption mechanisms.",
"B": "There's no concern as 'Custom resource files' are designed to securely store sensitive data, and the application is following best practices.",
"C": "The main concern is that storing data in 'Custom resource files' will make the app run slower, and the remedy is optimizing the application's performance.",
"D": "Sensitive data in 'Custom resource files' could be compromised via SQL injection, and using parameterized queries is the remedy."
