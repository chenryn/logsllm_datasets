I. MOTIVATION AND GOALS
Critical systems are becoming more and more complex
and heterogeneous, integrating previously separated systems
and including design solutions ranging from the introduction
of software Off-The-Shelf (OTS) to the adoption of loosely-
integrated and composable services. Innovative dependabil-
ity assessment solutions and certiﬁcation processes are thus
needed to deal with such complexity, calling for new solutions
for the efﬁcient, automated, and possibly continuous assess-
ment and certiﬁcation.
The workshop on Recent Advances in the DependabIlity
AssessmeNt of Complex systEms (RADIANCE),
in its
ﬁrst edition, aims to discuss novel dependability assessment
approaches for complex systems and to promote their adoption
in real-world settings through industrial and academic research.
The main objective is to promote and foster discussion on
novel ideas, constituting a forum where researchers can share
both real problems and innovative solutions for the assessment
of complex systems.
The workshop focuses on assessing complex evolving
systems, where increasing complexity and changes are due
to the introduction of new components and sensors, and to
the extensive usage of software OTS components or black
box components in general. In this macro area, the workshop
welcomed a broad list of applications ranging from agile
development in critical systems to model-driven assessment
approaches as well as new needs for veriﬁcation, validation
and certiﬁcation of dynamic and evolving systems, which
also includes solutions for automating the veriﬁcation and
validation processes. Finally, the workshop was interested in
experimental assessment of dependability and security at large.
We believe that the RADIANCE goals are aligned with
the main trends in the evolution of critical systems, which
showed the progressive shift from small systems in close
networks towards broad, open, potentially loosely-integrated
System of Systems. They are also aligned with recent research
trends in the community of dependable and secure systems,
therefore with the main topics of the DSN.
II. CONTRIBUTIONS
The Program Committee (PC) selected consists of an
eclectic group of 23 researchers from around the globe,
including a minority of experienced representatives of the
partners of the sponsoring projects. The ﬁnal list includes a
mixture of researchers from the academia and industry which
provided enough diversity to assess the quality of the different
submissions received.
RADIANCE was able to attract submissions from both
industry and academia and also from all corners of the
world. The ﬁnal number of submissions received was 14,
a number that met our expectations for the ﬁrst edition of
the workshop. By these submissions, it is possible to see the
strong contribution from the supporting projects. However,
the workshop also received 6 submissions from outside these
projects.
Thanks to the PC members and also to 5 external re-
viewers it was possible to perform at least 3 reviews in each
paper, helping to guarantee the high quality of the selection
process. The papers where evaluated based on their scientiﬁc
impact or industrial applicability, taking into account not only
their novelty but also their capacity to promote interesting
discussion in the challenges addressed by the workshop.
From the submissions received, 10 papers were accepted
to be presented in the workshop. We are conﬁdent that the
ﬁnal list of accepted papers has the ingredients to foster the
discussion on novel ideas and the transfer of knowledge among
the participants.
III. PROGRAM
A. Keynote presentation
The workshop will start with an invited keynote by Bradley
Schmerl, a Senior Systems Scientist at the Institute for Soft-
ware Research of the School of Computer Science of the
Carnegie Mellon University.
The title of the presentation is “Challenges in Engineering
Dependable Self-Adaptive System” and it will cover relevant
work that his research group has been doing to make self-
adaptive systems more dependable. This includes probabilistic

model checking and stochastic games to provide assurances for
adaptation especially in the presence of uncertainty, models
to specify context and impact of adaptation, and ultimately
prediction and involvement of human operators in the process
of adaptation.
Self-Adaptive systems are very complex by their nature as
dynamic and evolving systems. Thus, the assessment of their
dependability raises particular challenges, which must be met
with novel techniques. We believe that this presentation can
set the tone for interesting discussions for the whole duration
of the workshop.
B. Paper discussion sessions
The workshop will also feature the presentation and the
discussion of the accepted papers. Given the interest of the
workshop in novel
techniques (even if preliminary) much
emphasis will be put on the discussion phase.
The accepted papers span on four macro areas: 1) Security
and Dependability analysis, with papers which use analysis
techniques to quantify the impact of security attacks and
dependability problems; 2) Agile Development and Natural
Language Requirements, featuring papers that automatize and
improve development processes that are dependent on natural
language documentation; 3) Safety assessment in industrial
systems, presenting papers which discuss safety assessment
challenges faced by the industry such as cost estimation
and processes improvement; 4) Fault Injection for Complex
Systems, including papers that apply fault injection techniques,
a premier technique for dependability assessment, to complex
systems such as SOAs, OTS and for novel purposes such as
failure prediction.
Presenting this groups together in the same session allows
a more focused discussion of the topics. To foster and cement
the discussion, we also plan to have wrap-up discussions
in the end of every session, where the common points of
the presented papers will be recapitulated, challenges will be
raised and there will be more room to discuss the main points
presented.
