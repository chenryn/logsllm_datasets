User: I'm developing a web interface for an already existing desktop application. I've been looking for a way to allow the server to push content to the browser and ended up reaching Comet.
Navigating through the internet, and most of the questions here, I got answers like twisted, orbited, tornado and most of them even point to java applications like Jetty or StreamHub.
Without going too much deeper in this, I'd like to know is there's a chance to implement Comet-like communication using just standard lib modules like BaseHTTPServer and keep things as simple as possible as I don't need so much power and efficiency.
Note: Jython is a possibility, but I'd like to keep it with as less requirements as possible.
Assistant: Extending what lost-theory has said, if you want to use comet for a passing messages between clients then you need to implement something like pubsub.
Using something like tornado for the pubsub is much simpler than with the single threaded wsgiref servers.
