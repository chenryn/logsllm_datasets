Abstract 
Malfunctions of systems in domains such as medicine, 
avionics, traffic control, defense and nuclear applications 
can  cause  human  injuries.  Test  and  validation  of  such 
systems is a difficult task, because many situations cannot 
be safely reproduced. Simulation makes possible to assess 
the  correctness  of  a  safety-critical  system,  even  in 
dangerous situations.  
This  paper  presents  CLAIRE,  a  purely  software 
simulation 
for  system 
modelling, designed for test, validation and non-intrusive 
dynamic analysis of real time applications.

2. Tool Design and Facilities 
The  tool  design  is  based  on  the  following  concepts: 
event, data flow model and purely software simulation.  
Event-driven  simulation  was  chosen  to  fulfil  the 
requirements  for  code  validation:  an  event  is  associated 
with  an  action,  which  sets  the  system  into  a  predefined 
state.  Such  events  can  be  the  execution  of  a  particular 
instruction, the access to memory address, etc. With such 
events,  the  user  can  associate  reactions  like:  sending  a 
message, stopping the execution, etc.  
With  CLAIRE,  can  be  created  a  description  of  the 
system  using  a  top-down  hierarchical  technique,  with  no 
limit  on  the  number  of  levels.  The  low-level  boxes  can 
contain user actions. The data flow is represented by the 
lines  connecting  boxes.  The  exchanged  data  information 
can  be  continuous  (accessible  at  any  time)  or  discrete 
(associated  with  an  event).  An  event  carries  information 
about data variables, the time of assignment and triggered 
functions.

tool-library 
The  tool  relies  on  a  purely  software  simulation;  this 
means  that  the  environment  and  the  hardware  on  which 
the binary code under test will run are entirely simulated. 
Therefore, 
includes  microprocessor 
simulators  (Motorola  68000  Family,  Intel  586,  etc)  and 
allows the user to add components. Each simulator drives 
the  passage  of  time  using  instruction  execution-time 
information.  The  lines  connected  to  a  microprocessor 
simulator can contain variables used to inspect the binary 
code

The  user  can  describe  test  strategies  in  low-level 
boxes,  dynamically  modify  input  data,  microprocessor 
memory  or  registers,  inject  faults  in  order  to  assess  the 
system behaviour in different conditions. 
During  simulation,  the  user  can  enable/disable  trace 
files 
to  store  modified  variables,  created  events, 
microprocessor internal states, binary code coverage, and 
user  actions.  CLAIRE  offers  facilities  for  trace  file 
display and analysis.  
CLAIRE was written in the C language and is currently 
available for Unix and Linux machines.  
3. Practical Experience 
The  French 
Institute 
for  Nuclear  Safety  and 
Radioprotection  (IRSN)  uses  CLAIRE  to  perform  safety 
analysis  and  evaluations  of  large  real-time  distributed 
systems  used  for  instrumentation  and  control  in  nuclear 
power  plants.  Systems  of  up  to  8  microprocessors  were 
modelled  and  submitted  to  consistency  and  robustness 
checks.  
CLAIRE  is  currently  being  evaluated  in  different 
application domains: avionics, smart card, transport.
