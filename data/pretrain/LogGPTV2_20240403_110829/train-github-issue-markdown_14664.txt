On testing #2994
In the following snippet place the caret on 'hello' and perform a 'Fold'
operation:
    class xyz {
        foo() {
            if (a == b) {   
                hello
            } else {
                world
            }
        }
    }
Observe: 'foo()' get collapsed but I would expect that the 'if' gets
collapsed.
