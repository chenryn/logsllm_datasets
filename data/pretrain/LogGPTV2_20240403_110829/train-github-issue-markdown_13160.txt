We have a lot of modules which a user might want to import, and it would be
nice to show a list of these as a completion hint after `import {} from '`  
Additionally, we have so many modules that walking the filesystem is not
practical, and some of them are generated external module names, not files. So
we would like to run a periodic indexing, and then somehow provide a list of
these to the language services (eg. an RPC, or a file we stage on local disk,
etc.)
