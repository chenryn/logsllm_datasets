Hello,

I am new to React and have been following various tutorials to enhance my understanding. However, in the initial stages, I encountered a problem that I could not resolve despite extensive searching. Even on Stack Overflow, only one person reported a similar issue, which remained unanswered.

The problem is well-explained in the following link:  
[Compiler Issue with npm, react, package-lock.json, autoprefixer version 9.8.1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62488064/compiler-issue-with-npm-react-package-lock-json-autoprefixer-version-9-8-1/62506484#62506484)

After trying numerous solutions, I found a workaround that I posted under the question. While I am not entirely certain that my solution is 100% correct, it resolved the issue for me. Specifically, whenever I create a new React project, I need to change the "Kleur" value in the dependencies to avoid encountering the problem again.

Initially, I suspected that the issue might be related to React itself. To verify this, I uninstalled React, cleared my cache, re-downloaded React, and created a new project, but the problem persisted.

Here is the error message I received:

![React Error](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54753959/85247083-48157c00-b412-11ea-9618-c93d73ef01b5.png)

Thank you for your help.

Best regards,  
[Your Name]
