Hello  
I am new to React and I am following some tutorials to learn more but in the
first few steps, I face a problem that I can't find any solution for it. Even
in the stack overflow, only one person had the same problem that no one
answers it. problem explained well in the following link:  
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62488064/compiler-issue-with-npm-react-
package-lock-json-autoprefixer-version-9-8-1/62506484#62506484  
After trying lots of different things I found a solution to this problem that
I posted under this question. I am not very sure that what I did is 100%
correct but it solved my problem and I wanted to say whenever I create a new
React project I have to change the "Kleur" value in dependency to not face the
problem.  
I thought maybe this is a problem in React because I also uninstall the React
and cleaned my cache and download a new React and create a new project but
still had same problem.  
This is the error that I received.
