# Tutorial: Learn common operators
[Kusto Query Language (KQL)](../index.md) is used to write queries in [Azure Data Explorer](https://dataexplorer.azure.com/), [Azure Monitor Log Analytics](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/monitor/#overview), [Azure Sentinel](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/microsoft-sentinel/), and more. This tutorial is an introduction to the essential KQL operators used to access and analyze your data.
For more specific guidance on how to query logs in Azure Monitor, see [Get started with log queries](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/get-started-queries).

> * [Count rows](#count-rows)
> * [See a sample of data](#see-a-sample-of-data)
> * [Select a subset of columns](#select-a-subset-of-columns)
> * [List unique values](#list-unique-values)
> * [Filter by condition](#filter-by-condition)
> * [Sort results](#sort-results)
> * [Get the top *n* rows](#get-the-top-n-rows)
> * [Create calculated columns](#create-calculated-columns)
> * [Map values from one set to another](#map-values-from-one-set-to-another)
The examples in this tutorial use the `StormEvents` table, which is publicly available in the [**help** cluster](https://help.kusto.windows.net/Samples). To explore with your own data, [create your own free cluster](../../../start-for-free-web-ui.md).
## Prerequisites
* A Microsoft account or Microsoft Entra user identity to sign in to the [help cluster](https://dataexplorer.azure.com/clusters/help)
## Count rows
Begin by using the [count](../count-operator.md) operator to find the number of storm records in the `StormEvents` table.
> [!div class="nextstepaction"]
> Run the query
```Kusto
StormEvents 
| count
```
**Output**
|Count|
|--|
|59066|
## See a sample of data
To get a sense of the data, use the [take](../take-operator.md) operator to view a sample of records. This operator returns a specified number of arbitrary rows from the table, which can be useful for previewing the general data structure and contents.
> [!div class="nextstepaction"]
> Run the query
```Kusto
StormEvents 
| take 5
```
The following table shows only 6 of the 22 returned columns. To see the full output, run the query.
|StartTime|EndTime|EpisodeId|EventId|State|EventType|...|
|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
|2007-09-20T21:57:00Z|2007-09-20T22:05:00Z|11078|60913|FLORIDA|Tornado|...|
|2007-12-20T07:50:00Z|2007-12-20T07:53:00Z|12554|68796|MISSISSIPPI|Thunderstorm Wind|...|
|2007-12-30T16:00:00Z|2007-12-30T16:05:00Z|11749|64588|GEORGIA|Thunderstorm Wind|...|
|2007-09-29T08:11:00Z|2007-09-29T08:11:00Z|11091|61032|ATLANTIC SOUTH|Waterspout|...|
|2007-09-18T20:00:00Z|2007-09-19T18:00:00Z|11074|60904|FLORIDA|Heavy Rain|...|
## Select a subset of columns
Use the [project](../project-operator.md) operator to simplify the view and select a specific subset of columns. Using `project` is often more efficient and easier to read than viewing all columns.
> [!div class="nextstepaction"]
> Run the query
```Kusto
StormEvents
| take 5
| project State, EventType, DamageProperty
```
**Output**
|State|EventType|DamageProperty|
|--|--|--|
|ATLANTIC SOUTH|Waterspout|0|
|FLORIDA|Heavy Rain|0|
|FLORIDA|Tornado|6200000|
|GEORGIA|Thunderstorm Wind|2000|
|MISSISSIPPI|Thunderstorm Wind|20000|
## List unique values
It appears that there are multiple types of storms based on the results of the previous query. Use the [distinct](../distinctoperator.md) operator to list all of the unique storm types.
> [!div class="nextstepaction"]
> Run the query
```Kusto
StormEvents 
| distinct EventType
```
There are 46 types of storms in the table. Here's a sample of 10 of them.
|EventType|
|--|
|Thunderstorm Wind|
|Hail|
|Flash Flood|
|Drought|
|Winter Weather|
|Winter Storm|
|Heavy Snow|
|High Wind|
|Frost/Freeze|
|Flood|
|...|
## Filter by condition
The [where](../where-operator.md) operator filters rows of data based on certain criteria.
The following query looks for storm events in a specific `State` of a specific `EventType`.
> [!div class="nextstepaction"]
> Run the query
```Kusto
StormEvents
| where State == 'TEXAS' and EventType == 'Flood'
| project StartTime, EndTime, State, EventType, DamageProperty
```
There are 146 events that match these conditions. Here's a sample of 5 of them.
