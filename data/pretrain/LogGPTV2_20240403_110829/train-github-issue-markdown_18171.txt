I was being really lazy when I wrote this one-liner:
    bytes2hex(arr::Vector{UInt8}) = join([hex(i,2) for i in arr])
It's a good intro issue to rewrite this to pre-allocate a byte buffer, go
through and fill it with hex characters appropriately and then return that
buffer wrapped in a string object.
