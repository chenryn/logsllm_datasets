E[re], E[r2
Proof:
In (k, ǫ)-obf, m existing edges are assigned
probabilities 1 − re while np potential edges are assigned
probabilities re. Therefore, the total variance is T Vobf =
m(1− re)(1− (1− re)) + npre(1− re) = (m + np)re(1− re)
where re ← Rσ. Take the expectation of T Vobf , we get
E[T Vobf ] = (m + np)(E[re] − E[r2

in the limit cases of PL and ER random graphs.
VI. QUANTIFYING FRAMEWORK
This section describes a generic framework for privacy and
utility quantiﬁcation of anonymization methods.
A. Privacy Measurement
We focus on structural re-identiﬁcation attacks under var-
ious models of attacker’s knowledge as shown in [7]. We
quantify the privacy of an anonymized graph as the sum of
re-identiﬁcation probabilities of all nodes in the graph. We
differentiate closed-world from open-world adversaries. For
example, when a closed-world adversary knows that Bob has
three neighbors, this fact is exact. An open-world adversary
in this case would learn only that Bob has at least three
neighbors. We consider the result of structural query Q on
a node u as the node signature sigQ(u). Given a query Q,
nodes having the same signatures form an equivalence class.
So given the true graph G0 and an output anonymized graph
G∗, the privacy is measured as in the following example.
Example 6.1: Assuming that we have signatures of G0
and signatures of G∗ as in Table IV, the re-identiﬁcation
probabilities in G∗ of nodes 1,2 are 1
3 , of nodes 4,8 are
1
2 , of nodes 3,5,6,7 are 0s. And the privacy score of G∗ is
3 + 1
3 + 1
1
2 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1.66. In G0, the privacy
3 + 1
score is 1
3 = 3, equal to the
number of equivalence classes.

s1{1, 2, 6}, s2{4, 7}, s3{3, 8}, s4{5}
We consider two privacy scores in this paper.
• H1 score uses node degree as the node signature, i.e.
we assume that the attacker know apriori degrees of all
nodes.
• H2
open uses the set (not multiset) of degrees of node’s
friends as the node signature. For example, if a node
has 6 neighbors and the degrees of those neighbors are
{1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 5}, then its signature for H2open attack is
{1, 2, 3, 5}.
Higher-order scores like H2 (exact multiset of neighbors’
degrees) or H3 (exact multiset of neighbor-of-neighbors’ de-
grees) induce much higher privacy scores of the true graph G0
(in the order of |V |) and represent less meaningful metrics for
privacy. The following proposition claims the automorphism-
invariant property of structural privacy scores.
Proposition 6.1: All privacy scores based on structural
queries [7] are automorphism-invariant, i.e. if we ﬁnd a non-
trivial automorphism G1 of G0, the signatures of all nodes in
G1 are unchanged.
Proof: The proof is trivially based on the deﬁnition of
graph automorphism. We omit it due to the lack of space.
B. Utility Measurement
1) Degree-based statistics:
• Number of edges: SN E = 1
2Pv∈V dv
• Average degree: SAD = 1
nPv∈V dv
• Maximal degree: SMD = maxv∈V dv
• Degree variance: SDV = 1
nPv∈V (dv − SAD)2
• Power-law exponent of degree sequence: SP L is the
estimate of γ assuming the degree sequence follows a
power-law ∆(d) ∼ d−γ
2) Shortest path-based statistics:
• Average distance: SAP D is the average distance among
all pairs of vertices that are path-connected.
• Effective diameter: SEDiam is the 90-th percentile dis-
tance among all path-connected pairs of vertices.
• Connectivity length: SCL is deﬁned as the harmonic
mean of all pairwise distances in the graph.
• Diameter : SDiam is the maximum distance among all
path-connected pairs of vertices.
3) Clustering statistics:
• Clustering coefﬁcient: SCC = 3N∆
where N∆ is the
number of triangles and N3 is the number of connected
triples.
N3
All of the above statistics are computed on sample graphs
generated from the uncertain output G. In particular, to es-
timate shortest-path based measures, we use Approximate
Neighbourhood Function (ANF) [12]. The diameter is lower
bounded by the longest distance among all-destination bread-
ﬁrst-searches from 1,000 randomly chosen nodes.
VII. EVALUATION
In this section, our evaluation aims to show the disadvan-
tages of (k, ǫ)-obf and RandWalk/RandWalk-mod as well as
the gap between them. We then illustrate the effectiveness and
efﬁciency of the gap-ﬁlling approaches MaxVar and Mixture.
The effectiveness is measured by privacy scores (lower is
better) and the relative error of utility (lower is better). The
efﬁciency is measured by the running time. All algorithms are
implemented in Python and run on a desktop PC with Intelr
Core i7-4770@ 3.4Ghz, 16GB memory. We use MOSEK5 as
the quadratic solver.
Three large real-world datasets are used in our experiments
6. dblp is a co-authorship network where two authors are
connected if they publish at least one paper together. amazon
is a product co-purchasing network where the graph contains
an undirected edge from i to j if a product i is frequently co-
purchased with product j. youtube is a video-sharing web
site that includes a social network. The graph sizes (|V |,|E|)
of dblp, amazon and youtube are (317080, 1049866),
(334863, 925872) and (1134890, 2987624) respectively. We
partition dblp, amazon into 20 subgraphs and youtube
into 60 subgraphs. The sample size of each test case is 20.
Following [2] and [21], we consider three groups of statis-
tics for utility measurement: degree-based statistics, shortest-
path based statistics and clustering statistics.

A. (k, ǫ)-obf and RandWalk
We report the performance of (k, ǫ)-obf in Table V. We keep
the number of potential edges equal to m (default value in
[2]) and vary σ. We ﬁnd that the scheme achieves low relative
errors only at small σ. However, privacy scores, especially
H2open, rise fast (up to 50% compared to the true graph).
This fact incurs high privacy-utility tradeoff as conﬁrmed in
Table VIII.
Table VI shows the performance similarity between Rand-
Walk and RandWalk-mod except the case of youtube and for
t = 2 in amazon. Because RandWalk-mod satisﬁes the third
constraint, it beneﬁts several degree-based statistics while the
existence of selﬂoops and multiedges does not impact much on
shortest-path based metrics. RandWalk misses a lot of edges
at t = 2 (see footnote 1 in Section IV-B). The remarkable
characteristics of random-walk schemes are the very low
privacy scores and the high relative errors (lower-bounded
around 8 to 10%). Clearly,
there is a gap between high
tradeoffs in (k, ǫ)-obf and high relative errors in RandWalk
where MaxVar and Mixture may play their roles.
B. Effectiveness of MaxVar
We assess privacy and utility of MaxVar by varying the
number of potential edges np. The results are shown in Table
VII. As for privacy scores, if we increase np, we gain better
privacy as we allow more edge switches. Due to the expected
degree constraints in the quadratic program, all degree-based
metrics vary only a little.
.
|EG0|
We observe the near linear relationships between H1,
rel.err and the number of replaced edges |EG0 \ EG| in
Figures 4, 6 and near quadratic relationship of H2open against
|EG0 \ EG| in Fig.5. The ratio of replaced edges in Figures
4,5 and 6 is deﬁned as |EG0\EG|
The runtime of MaxVar consists of time for (1) partitioning
G0, (2) adding friend-of-friend edges to subgraphs, (3) solving
quadratic subproblems and (4) combining uncertain subgraphs
to get G. We report the runtime in Fig.7. As we can see,
the total runtime is in several minutes and the runtime of the
partitioning step is almost negligible. Increasing np gives rise
to the runtime in steps 2,3 and 4 and the trends are nearly
linear. The runtime on youtube is three times longer than
on the other two datasets, almost linear to their data sizes.

C. Comparative Evaluation
Table VIII shows comparisons between MaxVar, (k, ǫ)-
is
obf and RandWalk/RandWalk-mod. The column tradeoff
pH2open × rel.err as we conjecture the quadratic and linear
behavior of H2open and rel.err respectively (Figures 5 and
6). We omit the column H1× rel.err because they are almost
equal for all schemes considered in this work. Clearly, MaxVar
gains better privacy-utility tradeoffs than (k, ǫ)-obf, but worse
than RandWalk, RandWalk-mod. However, MaxVar has its own
merit as a gap-ﬁlling solution. Figures 8,9 and 10 show that
while RandWalk, RandWalk-mod have the best tradeoffs, they
suffer from high lower bounds for utility. In other words, if
the dataset allows higher privacy risk for better utility (lower
rel.err) then the usage of two random walk based solutions may
be limited. The simple solution Mixture also ﬁlls the gap. We
omit EdgeSwitch due to its worst tradeoffs.
In addition to the re-identiﬁcation scores H1 and H2open,
we also compute ǫ for k ∈ {30, 50, 100} to have a fair
comparison with (k, ǫ)-obf. Table VIII shows that MaxVar has
the best (k, ǫ) scores. The number of potential edges used in
MaxVar could be 20% of |EG0|, much less than that of (k, ǫ)-
obf (100% for c = 2 [2]). MaxVar and RandWalk/RandWalk-
mod have |EG0 \ EG| ≃ |EG \ EG0| and these two quantities
