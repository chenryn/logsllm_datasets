User: Please provide a security audit checklist to ensure the security of servers and network equipment.
Assistant: The following is a checklist of possible security audit checks to ensure the security of servers and network equipment, but it is not an absolutely comprehensive list. The specific checklist should be adjusted appropriately according to different situations and needs. 1. Physical Security - Verify that servers and network equipment are stored in a secure, controlled area with access only to authorized personnel. - Check that servers and network equipment receive adequate protection measures, such as gates, fingerprint recognition, door locks, etc., to prevent unauthorized personnel from entering. - Verify that servers and network equipment have proper power distribution and grounding to eliminate possible electrical faults. - Verify that servers and network equipment are connected to a reliable UPS power supply to provide backup power. 2. Network security - Confirm whether there is a network intrusion detection system (IDS) to detect and prevent network security breaches and attacks in real time. - Check that network firewall rules are adequately blocking unauthorized network access. - Verify that all services, ports, and remote access connections are restricted and that necessary measures are taken to prevent brute-force cracking and attacks. - Inspect network traffic to ensure sensitive information is not leaked. 3. System Configuration and Updates - Checks the operating system for the latest security patches and updates to address known vulnerabilities. - Check whether the necessary system configuration files and monitoring tools are in place to detect system abnormalities in a timely manner. - Verify that all default administrator usernames and passwords have been modified to improve administrator account security. - Verify that all user accounts have appropriate permissions and check that all unnecessary accounts have been removed. - Verify that syslog is enabled and that all security-related events are logged. 4. Application Security - Checks that all applications are installed and configured correctly to provide optimum security. - Verify that necessary application updates and patches are installed and protect against known vulnerabilities. - Check whether all web applications have been security hardened, such as web application firewall, code repair, anti-DOS/DDOS attack and SQL injection attack, etc. - Checks all third-party applications and library files for malicious intrusion to avoid vulnerabilities on the system. - Confirm that all upload and download operations are restricted to prevent file inclusion vulnerabilities and Web shell attacks. 5. Database Security - Check if database logging should be enabled in order to record database operations and query history. - Verify that the database has adequate security measures enabled, such as password complexity, access permissions, and security auditing. - Examine authentication mechanisms for all databases and determine whether best security practices, password policies, and data encryption techniques are in place. - Check that remote access should be disabled and ensure that all databases have the latest security patches and updates. - Confirm backup and recovery strategies for all databases and test backup and recovery procedures. 6. Social Engineering Security - Check for incoming phishing emails or other deceptive messages. - Verify that all employees have received adequate security training on how to identify and prevent security breaches such as password management, social engineering, and online fraud. - Verify that all employees never share passwords and account information, and are aware of other social engineering attack techniques. - Confirm that all sensitive data is adequately protected, such as data encryption and backups, and check that there is an adequate audit process to ensure security. 7. Supplier and Partner Security - Check all network and data sharing connections with suppliers and partners. - Verify that all partners have implemented best security practices such as data encryption, secure authentication, and data backup. - Verify that all suppliers, vendors and partners adhere to security assessment standards such as ISO 27001. - Confirm whether to cooperate with third-party security vendors or use third-party tools to identify network and application security vulnerabilities. 8. Recovery and Business Continuity Plan - Verify that contingency and disaster recovery plans are completed and updated as appropriate. - Check that relevant emergency contacts, business continuity plans and emergency contacts are in place and carry out relevant testing. - Confirm whether all data is backed up and test the recovery process to ensure that the recovery process is feasible.
