User: I have created a simple program in python.
Now I want trasform this script in an executable program ( with hidden source code if possible ) and when I click 2 times on it, the program install itself on the ubuntu ( in the /usr/lib or /usr/bin I think ) and it will create a new launcher in the Application -> Game menu.
How can I do that ?
Assistant: Closed-source? Meh. Well, you can compile python iirc, or simply use an obscusificator. But I recommend to open-source it ;-)
The stuff you can double-click are .desktop files, for samples, see find /usr | grep desktop.
