Thank you for your question. The article from React Etc. suggests that the adoption of React Router was being considered around version 5. However, to address your specific inquiry: as of Next.js version 9, it does not natively support React Router. 

Next.js has its own built-in routing and navigation system, which is designed to work seamlessly with its server-side rendering and other features. If you are looking to use React Router specifically, you may need to integrate it manually, though this might require some additional configuration and could potentially conflict with Next.js's built-in features.

For the most up-to-date and accurate information, I recommend checking the official Next.js documentation or release notes for any updates or changes in later versions. 

If you have any further questions, feel free to ask!
