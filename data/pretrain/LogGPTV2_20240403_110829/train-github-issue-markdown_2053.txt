### What problem does this feature solve?
Allows you to create a scoped block of HTML without having to create a
component (similar to petite-vue).

Please could you either keep this issue, re-open the original issue or add a
comment which atleast links to the issue/pr.
### What does the proposed API look like?
      {{ count }}
      inc
