### A. Lack of Innovation in Methodologies and Mindset

Building an AIOps platform requires domain-specific expertise to understand the application and think holistically. It also necessitates better visualization of the entire system, including problems, business perspectives, data models, constraints, and integration considerations. Currently, there is a lack of innovative methodologies that can guide stakeholders from different disciplines—such as business leaders, engineers, and data scientists—in developing AIOps solutions. This deficiency leads to difficulties in shifting mindsets. AIOps is a complex, multi-component system that requires continuous learning and improvement.

### B. Need for Changes in Engineering to Build and Support AIOps

Traditional engineering practices are no longer sufficient to meet current business requirements. Building an AIOps platform demands significant engineering and operational efforts. AIOps-oriented engineering and operations are still in their early stages, and best practices, principles, and design patterns have yet to be fully defined in the IT industry. For example, AIOps principles should include monitoring the quality and tagging of data. The quality and quantity of available data today are insufficient for AIOps solutions. Major cloud services collect vast amounts of telemetry data daily, but there is a lack of representative and high-quality data for building AIOps solutions. Continuous improvement in data quality and quantity is essential.

### C. Challenges in Building ML Models for AIOps

Developing machine learning (ML) or artificial intelligence (AI) models for AIOps solutions presents unique challenges not typically encountered in other ML/AI scenarios. For supervised machine learning models, the primary challenges include the absence of clear data labels and the need for significant manual effort to label and ensure high data quality. Additionally, there are complex dependencies and relationships among various components and services, requiring intricate feature engineering due to the high complexity of cloud computing service behaviors. In many AIOps scenarios, labeling data is difficult, and unsupervised machine learning models may be more feasible. For instance, detecting anomalous behavior in services is a common challenge.

### 2. Related Works

AIOps is an interdisciplinary field of research and innovation. While it is a long journey for the IT industry to implement complete AIOps solutions, this research focuses on the technical innovations and aspects required to achieve an AIOps platform. However, AIOps research is not entirely new; many studies on software and data analytics can be considered AIOps innovations.

#### A. Evolving from Traditional Systems to AIOps

In this research, a layered AIOps system with interoperable services between modules was proposed, making it compatible with traditional systems. The researchers implemented their AIOps system with specific considerations and deployed it in a large IT environment with thousands of devices, achieving positive results.

#### B. Reducing Incidents Using Correlation Approach

This work emphasizes the use of AIOps to handle digital changes in IT operations. An AIOps platform is valuable for complex IT systems and infrastructures, which require continuous monitoring and resolution in case of incidents.

#### C. Self-Supervised Anomaly Detection from Distributed Traces

This research focuses on anomaly detection based on distributed tracing records, which contain information about the services in a distributed system. Accurately detecting trace anomalies is challenging due to the large number of microservices and complex inter-service calls. The researchers proposed a supervised method and task formulation for anomaly detection, demonstrating high accuracy and solid performance in experiments.

### 3. AIOps Framework Design

Figure 2 illustrates the high-level methodology of an AIOps system. In an IT organization, various application systems generate logs, metrics, and incident reports from different technical stacks, such as databases, networks, applications, and operating systems. These inputs are pre-processed and categorized into error, warning, or information based on their severity. The pre-processed structured data is then used as input for the AIOps system. The AIOps system applies various machine learning algorithms and techniques to produce solutions like pattern and association discovery, prediction of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), and clustering of common feature data points, which aid in troubleshooting and root cause analysis (RCA).

### Log Operations

System logs are a critical component of any IT system, recording noteworthy events such as user activity, resource usage, program execution status, and data changes. Accurate log data provides a meaningful view of the past and current states of a complex IT system. Logs can be collected from various sources, such as web or application servers, end users, database servers, and APIs, and stored centrally for further monitoring, analysis, and processing.

### 4. AIOps Flowchart

A flowchart is a graphical representation of the steps required to complete a task. Figure 4 shows the flowchart for an AIOps platform, which operates through several phases. It begins with the monitoring of IT systems, collecting logs and event data. After pre-processing, the data is ready for machine learning algorithms. Based on the requirements, the AIOps framework applies ML algorithms such as association, clustering, and prediction, providing efficient analysis that helps reduce system operational problems and minimize Mean Time to Detect (MTTD) and Mean Time to Recover (MTTR). AIOps results can be used to implement recommendations through automation.

- **Auto Detection:** AIOps continuously analyzes data streams and metrics to determine application behavior.
- **Quick Resolution:** AIOps helps resolve issues quickly using ML techniques.
- **Reduce Noise:** AIOps overcomes alarm fatigue by automatically correlating and grouping related anomalies.
- **Reduce MTTD and MTTR:** AIOps reduces the mean time to detect and recover from system issues.

### 6. Conclusion

Machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques can be used to provide IT operations solutions. AIOps platforms should be built on these concepts to address IT operational challenges. AIOps platforms leverage machine learning to discover hidden relationships between log events and alerts. Machine learning algorithms efficiently predict Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) based on different alerts from various system sources. This paper addresses IT operational challenges by designing a systematic algorithmic framework and flowchart. The proposed approach introduces a new machine learning and log-based platform—AIOps—which opens new possibilities for association mining, clustering, and classification to predict potential outages and problems in the system.
