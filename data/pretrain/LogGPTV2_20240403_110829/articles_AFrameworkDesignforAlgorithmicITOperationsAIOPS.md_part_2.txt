A. Lack of innovation in methodologies and mindset
To build AIOpsplatform, it requires business or domain specific experience to understand
application and think holistically. It also need bettervisualisation about the whole system,
problems, business perspective, data models, constraints and integration
considerations.Today, there is lack of innovation methodologies that can guide people in
different disciplineslike business stake holders, engineers, data scientists to build AIOps
solutions which leads to difficulty in mindset shift. AIOps is a complex, multi component,
continuous learning and improvements system.[3]
B. Need of changes in engineering to build and support AIOps
Traditional engineering standard practices does not fit currentbusiness requirements. Building
AIOpsplatform needs significant engineering and operational efforts.AIOpsoriented
engineering and operationsare still in early stage. The best practices, principles and design
patterns are not defined in the IT industry yet. For example,AIOps principles should include
dataandlabel or tag quality monitoring. The quality and quantity of data available today
cannot serve the needs of AIOps solutions. Today major cloud services collectshuge amount
of telemetry data every day/month, there still lacks representative and highquality data for
building AIOps solutions. A continuous improvement of data quality and quantity is
necessary.[3]

There are lot of challenges in building ML/AI model for AIOps solutions because those are
not always seen in other typical ML/AI scenarios and solutions.Todevelop supervised
machine learning model for AIOps, there are challenges like no clear data labels or lot of
manual efforts to label and obtain high data quality [4], there are complex
dependencies/relations among various componentsandservices[5], also there are complicated
feature engineering efforts requiredue to the high complexity of cloud computing service
behaviours. In most ofAIOps scenarios, there is difficulty inlabelling a data, it is sometime
feasible in only unsupervised machine learning models. For example, detecting anomalous
behaviour of services [6].
[2] RELATED WORKS
AIOpsis a interdisciplinary research and innovation area. It is a long journey for IT industry
to implementcomplete AIOpssolutions. In this research, we focus on technical innovations
and aspect that are required to achieve AIOpsplatform. However, AIOps research is not
entirely new field. Many research works on software or data analytics can be represented as
AIOps innovations.
A. Evolving from Traditional Systems to AIOps
In this research, researcher proposed a AIOpssystem which adoptslayered design with
interoperability services between modules, which makes it well compatible with traditional
systems. Researcher implemented their AIOps system with some considerationsand deployed
it in a large IT system environment with thousands of devicesand achieved good results[7].
B. Reducing Incidents Using Correlation Approach
In this work, researcher emphasis on discussing AIOpsand explains themodel needed to
handle digital changes in IToperations. AIOps platform is useful forcomplex IT systems and
infrastructureswhich require continuousmonitoring and resolution in case ofaccidents. [8]
C. Self-Supervised Anomaly Detection from Distributed Traces
The focus ofthis research is on anomaly detection based on distributed tracingrecords which
contains information of services of distributed system. Detecting trace anomalies accuratelyis
challenging due to large number of microservices and complex calls between
them.Researcherproposed supervised method and task formulation for anomaly
detectionproblem.Theevaluation shows high accuracy and solid performance in
experiments.[9]
[3] AIOPS FRAMEWORK DESIGN
In Figure 2 , wepropose high level methodology of AIOps system. In IT organisation, there
are lot of application system works for various business purposes. Those application systems
continuously generates logs, metrics and incidents fromdatabase, network, application and
OS technical stacks. Based on their severity, these inputs can be pre-processed and
categories into error, warning or information. These data pre-processing transforms raw

unstructured logs, alerts into structured format. All these transformed structured data getting
used as an input to AIOpssystem.AIOps apply various machine learning algorithms and
techniques and produce different expected solutions like finding pattern or associations,
prediction of Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) and clustering common feature data
points which aids in troubleshooting and root cause analysis (RCA).AIOps is a complex,
multi component, continuous learning and improvements system.

Log Operations:
System logs are crucialcomponent of any IT system. Logs records noteworthy events
happened in the past such as user activity, resource usage,program execution status and
duration, data changes,application status change etc. They provide a meaningful view of past
and current states of complex IT system. Log data can only be trustworthy if it is accurate.
[10]
As shown in Figure 3, there are various sources of logs like web or application servers, end
users, database servers, digital devices, business applications, databases, Application
Programming Interfaces(API), login activities etc. Logs can be collected at centralisedplace
through different ways like monitoring tools,agent-based log collectors and APIs. Once logs
are collected, it would get store at centralise location for further monitoring, analysis and
processing.

solutions. AIOps platform should be built on this concept to solve IT operational challenges.

events and alerts.[11] Machine Learning algorithms efficiently predicts the Standard

sources.[12]
This paper addresses the problems of IT operational challenges by designing systematic
algorithmic framework and flowchart.We addressed the IT operational problems by
introducingnew machine learning and log based platform – AIOps. The proposed approach
opens a new possibilityfor Association mining and Clustering to detect patterns and
sequences. AIOps also gives possibility for Classifications of log events and alerts to predict
possible outages / problems in the system.
