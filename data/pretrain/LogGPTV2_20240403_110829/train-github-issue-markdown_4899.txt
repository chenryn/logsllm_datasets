Challenge http://freecodecamp.com/challenges/waypoint-give-your-javascript-
slot-machine-some-stylish-images has an issue. Please describe how to
reproduce it, and include links to screenshots if possible.
This challenge will allow you to pass even if your code for which section an
image is forgotten. (The correct way to say this is passing me so I'll add
some code).
Ex:
       $($('.slot')[0]).html('');
        $($('.slot')[0]).html('');
        $($('.slot')[0]).html('');
**Passes and allows you to go to the next challenge.
     $($('.slot')[0]).html('');
        $($('.slot')[1]).html('');
        $($('.slot')[2]).html('');
** But this is correct.
I understand the [#] isn't the focus here, but I wanted to say something just
to avoid developing bad practices. Also I believe the previous Waypoint may
have this issue as well.
