APPENDIX A
EXPERT ELICITATION STUDY
Fig. 5: Questions we asked in our semi-structured interviews with 22 experts.
Based on the interviews, we found 47 factors that experts expressed interest
in including on IoT privacy and security label.
Fig. 6: Questions we asked on the ﬁrst survey. In this stage, we asked experts
to review the factors from the interview study and specify their preferences
about including each factor, as well as their reasons.
Fig. 7: Questions we asked on the second survey. Here we presented experts
with common arguments from the ﬁrst survey and asked them again to make
decision about each and provide us with their additional arguments.
You are probably aware that food products have nutrition labels on them that tell you about all the different nutrition facts about them. However, when you buy an IoT device, there is no information like that. We are trying to develop a label for IoT devices that would focus on privacy and security aspects of those devices, similar to nutrition label for foods. Today I am going to talk to you about the things that should be on this privacy and security label for IoT devices.  Before asking about the label, I want you to please  Q: define security in the context of IoT devices.  Q: Can you also define privacy related to the IoT devices.  We are going to talk about what are the different factors that you would like to put on the label. Obviously there is a limi(cid:87)ed am(cid:82)(cid:88)n(cid:87) (cid:82)f (cid:86)(cid:83)ace (cid:82)n (cid:87)he label, b(cid:88)(cid:87) f(cid:82)(cid:85) n(cid:82)(cid:90) d(cid:82)n(cid:182)(cid:87) (cid:90)(cid:82)(cid:85)(cid:85)(cid:92) ab(cid:82)(cid:88)(cid:87) (cid:87)ha(cid:87) and le(cid:87)(cid:182)(cid:86) j(cid:88)(cid:86)(cid:87) (cid:87)alk ab(cid:82)(cid:88)(cid:87) (cid:90)ha(cid:87) fac(cid:87)(cid:82)(cid:85)(cid:86) (cid:92)(cid:82)(cid:88) (cid:90)(cid:82)(cid:88)ld like (cid:87)(cid:82) (cid:86)ee.  Q: Please specify the security factors that you would want to see on the label. Q: For each factor please specify the levels or values that you think this factor should have. Q: For each factor please specify the choices consumers may be provided with by the manufacturer.  (We asked the same questions for privacy and general factors)  Q: Among the factors you mentioned, please specify the ones that are good for experts b(cid:88)(cid:87) (cid:83)(cid:85)(cid:82)babl(cid:92) a(cid:85)en(cid:182)(cid:87) needed f(cid:82)(cid:85) c(cid:82)n(cid:86)(cid:88)me(cid:85)(cid:86).   (Presenting interviewee with the factors (privacy, security, and general) from the previous experts we have talked to)  Q: Please read the factors that other experts provided and compare them with the factors that you mentioned. Let me know if there is any factor, level, or choice that is currently not on your list, but you find it important for consumers to know about and want to add that to your list. Why do you think this should be added? Q: In what order do you think we should present the sections of privacy, security, and general information to consumers? Why? Please answer the following questions and provide us with the reasons that are most convincing to you. The reasons can be in your own words or alternatively, you can quote any resource that you think provides a well-explained reason. Please note that to design the privacy and security label, we will follow a layered approach. In a layered design, we will put the most important/understandable information on the first/primary layer and the additional important information will go on the secondary layer in case consumers are curious to know more or have privacy and security expertise and are looking for more information (the secondary layer can get updated if the value of any factor is changed). Therefore, you may believe that it is important to include a specific factor somewhere on the label, but not necessarily on the first/primary layer. Please also do not worry about the physical space on the label and how many factors should be included on it.  Q: For each factor, please select the statement that you believe is correct. (cid:120) Is an important factor to include on the label. (cid:120) Is not an important factor to include on the label. (cid:120) May or may not be an important factor to include on the label  (If experts respond that the factor is important or may or may not be important to include)  Q: Please specify your most convincing reason(s) as to why this is an important factor to put on the label. (Open-ended question)  (If experts respond that the factor is not important to include)  Q: Please specify your most convincing reason(s) as to why this is not an important factor to put on the label. (Open-ended question)  (For each participant, we asked the same questions for one third of the factors)  For each factor, please read the arguments for and against having that factor on the label (primary or secondary layer) and answer the questions. We selected the factors as well as the arguments from the experts we interviewed.  The label is not only to educate consumers to make informed purchase decisions, but also to hold IoT companies accountable for their privacy and security practices. In addition, all of the factors need to have a precise definition and metric, but for now do not worry about that and assume that the definition and metric is specified.   Including a factor on the label that describes whether or not the device is getting cryptographically signed and critical automatic security updates: (cid:120) is important because: o Consumers understand the importance of automatic security updates. o New vulnerabilities in software are discovered very often and hence continuous checking for updates is needed.    (cid:120) is not important because: o Signed security updates do not guarantee a well implemented and trustworthy update process.  o Sometimes there are reasons not to have automatic security updates. These reasons include legal considerations or if the device is incapable of receiving updates.   o Automatic updates should be a requirement and there is no need to explicitly mention them.    Q: I believe this factor (cid:120) Should definitely be on the label   (cid:120) Should probably be on the label (cid:120) I have no preference about this factor (cid:120) Should probably not be on the label (cid:120) Should definitely not be on the label  Q: On which layer of the label do you think this factor should be presented? (cid:120) primary/first layer (Please specify your reason(s)) [text field] (cid:120) secondary/extended layer (Please specify your reason(s)) [text field] (cid:120) I have no preference over this (Please specify your reason(s)) [text field]  Q: Information about this factor is for (select all that apply):  (cid:120) Consumers(cid:182) understanding (cid:120) E(cid:91)perts(cid:182) understanding (cid:120) For holding manufacturers accountable, e.g., using regulations (cid:120) Other (Please specify) [Text field]  Q: If the label had separate security, privacy, and general sections, this factor would be most appropriate for: (cid:120) The security section (cid:120) The privacy section (cid:120) Either the privacy or the security section (cid:120) The general information section (cid:120) None (Please specify) [text field]  Q: Please provide any additional arguments you may have for or against including this factor on the label.

[If participants specify a factor as being risky] What kinds of risks do you think
you could be exposed to by the information conveyed by this factor? What bad
things could happen as a result of this information?
If you were looking for a camera that was like this but less risky, what would
you like to see instead of the current information for this factor?

[first without the label, then with the label] I want you to please take a look at this smart
security camera package. Please let me know what can you learn about the privacy and
security of this device?
[Risk Communication in Comparative Purchase Process]
Let’s say you were trying to decide whether to buy the security camera that I just showed
you. The store has this other security camera, which is the same price and has the same
features. However, it has slightly different privacy and security related information, which
is now being presented on the label on the package. Please take a look at these two
devices and tell me
why do you think they are better?
• What are the things that this company has done better over the other one and
• What are the things that this company has done worse and why do you think
•
• What is the most useful piece of information on this label that helped you
they are worse?
Overall, which device would you purchase? Why?
make this decision?
[explain the idea of a layered label] Please scan the QR code or type in the URL on the
primary layer to take a look at the secondary layer of the label.
Except the devices that I showed you in our study, have you ever seen a
