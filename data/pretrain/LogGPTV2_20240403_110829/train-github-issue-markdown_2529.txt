My main issue is with the character "$", currently when trying to select
$myVar the double click only select myVar.  
This is uber annoying since i'm used to call my variable like this.
Moreover when editing php scripts it gets more difficult to avoid this issue.
Overall, the double click selection should stick to the variable name pattern
of the current language if possible, or accept the $ in the word, at least.
