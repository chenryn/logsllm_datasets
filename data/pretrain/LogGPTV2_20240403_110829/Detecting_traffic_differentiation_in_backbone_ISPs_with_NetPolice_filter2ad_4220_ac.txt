ply. As shown in Figure 5, the measured loss rates on 30% of the
paths increase signiﬁcantly when the probing interval changes from
500ms to 300ms. This indicates the rate-limiting threshold of the
routers along those paths is between 300ms and 500ms. The loss
rate curves of 1s, 2s, and 500ms are almost indistinguishable, sug-
gesting that the 1-second interval is sufﬁciently large to avoid trig-
gering ICMP rate-limiting on most routers. Otherwise, we would
have observed the loss rates measured by the 2-second interval to
be much smaller than those measured by the 1-second interval.
5.3 Loss on reverse path
NetPolice relies on single-ended probes to measure loss rate. The
measured loss rate can be inﬂated due to reverse path loss. Since
large packets are more likely to be dropped [20], we use 1000-byte
probe packets to ensure the measured loss is mostly on forward
Figure 7: ReErr before & after ﬁltering.
The loss rate measured by 40-byte probe packets is much
smaller. In fact, we can use this loss rate as the upper bound of the
loss rate on reverse path. To further limit the impact of reverse path
loss, we compute ReErr as the ratio of the loss rate measured by
40-byte packets and that by 1000-byte packets on each path. This
ReErr is a conservative estimate of the relative error of loss rate
measurements induced by reverse path loss. Figure 7 shows that
ReErr is less than 10% on 70% of the paths. We ﬁnd ReErr
tends to be large on paths with high loss rate, e.g., ReErr exceeds
10% on most of the paths with loss rate >7%. By discarding 6%
of the paths with such abnormally high loss rate, ReErr is within
10% on 80% of the remaining paths. In essence, we sacriﬁce path
coverage a little for higher measurement accuracy.
5.4 Load balancing
Per-ﬂow load balancing is observed extensively in our measure-
ments, e.g., BitTorrent trafﬁc and HTTP trafﬁc take different inter-
nal IP-level paths between 48% of the source-destination pairs. To
eliminate the effect of load balancing, we take a conservative ap-
proach in detecting content-based differentiation. We ﬁrst detect
potential differentiation for each application pair from the initial

measurement data. We then verify that the detected differentiation
still exists when the probe packets of the two applications traverses
the same internal IP-level path. Since per-ﬂow load balancing al-
gorithms use the ﬁve tuple (srcip, dstip, srcpt, dstpt, proto) to
choose an internal path, we ﬁx the ﬁve tuple of one application
while only changing the source port of the other application un-
til the probe packets of both applications follow the same internal
IP-level path. The results in §6 are obtained after applying this
controlled procedure to each application pair.
6. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
In this section, we provide concrete evidence of trafﬁc differenti-
ation based on content (§6.1) and routing (§6.3) in backbone ISPs.
We study the types of information used to construct content-based
differentiation policies and the scope of such policies in an ISP
network (§6.4). Without access to ISPs’ proprietary policy conﬁg-
urations, we leverage both TOS value in probe packets (§6.4) and
two-ended controlled probing (§6.2) to validate the detected differ-
entiations. We also provide insight into when differentiations occur
(§6.5) and how signiﬁcant they are (§6.6) in the large ISPs being
studied. Finally, we demonstrate that content and routing based
differentiation can be easily implemented on today’s commercial
routers (§6.7).
6.1 Content-based differentiation
Table 3 presents the detection results of content-based differen-
tiation. We only listed the 4 ISPs that exhibits large degree of dif-
ferentiation. We use the performance of HTTP as a baseline in
comparison with the performance of each of the 4 remaining ap-
plications. For a particular application, the “Paths” column lists
the number and percentage of ISP internal IP-level paths on which
differentiation of the application is detected. Surprisingly, these
4 large ISPs show clear evidence of differentiation of applications
such as BitTorrent, PPLive, SMTP, and VoIP in Table 3. For in-
stance, BitTorrent experiences higher loss rate on 3794 (19%) paths
in ISP12. This is also true for SMTP on 573 (11%) paths in ISP2.
In contrast, ISP2 and ISP3 treat VoIP preferentially on 172 (3.2%)
and 203 (2.1%) internal paths. While content-based differentiation
is known to exist in broadband ISPs [13], we are the ﬁrst to detect
such differentiation in backbone ISPs.
The percentage of internal paths with detected differentiation is
relatively small for some applications. This can be explained by
two reasons: i) the differentiation policies are not universally de-
ployed within the ISPs. By analyzing the TOS marking behavior
of these ISPs (explained in §6.4), we ﬁnd the differentiation poli-
cies are deployed only at certain routers. If we only consider the
internal paths traversing those routers, the percentage of paths with
detected differentiation will become much higher as shown in the
“TOSδ” column in Table 3; ii) trafﬁc differentiation may happen
only during certain periods, e.g., when network is congested. Since
we can only measure the loss rate of a path once every two hours
(explained in §4), we may not observe any loss rate differences on

a path even if it is conﬁgured with differentiation polices. In §6.5,
we will show that there is indeed a strong correlation between dif-
ferentiation and network load.
The loss rate samples may contain noise even after the ﬁlter-
ing process described in §5. The remaining noise may still lead to
false positives in the detection results. Because we do not have the
ground truth, we cannot quantify false positives directly. Instead,
we use the following analysis to show that the detection results in-
deed reﬂect content-based differentiation performed by the ISPs.
The main idea is to compare for the same paths the detected differ-
entiation across different content with any observable differences
due to noise for the same content. Strong evidence of content-based
differentiation is manifested if the former is much more prominent
than the latter.
We ﬁrst randomly divide the loss rate samples of the same ap-
plication measured on the same path into two equally-sized subsets
and apply the K-S test to these two subsets. Since the samples in
both subsets are drawn from the same distribution, an acceptance
of the test indicates a false positive due to noise. The test results are
in the “FP” column in Table 3. We then make the conjecture that
ISPs do not carry out any content-based differentiation. Under this
conjecture, we deduce that: i) the detection results in the “Paths”
column are all “false positives”; ii) the number of false positives
results from the K-S test should be independent of whether it is
conducted between the same application (column “FP”) or between
different applications (column “Paths”). Nonetheless, the numbers
in the “Paths” column are mostly over an order of magnitude larger
than those in the “FP” column, contradicting our conjecture. This
therefore suggests the detection results do reﬂect content-based dif-
ferentiation performed by the ISPs.
In §6.4, we will further cross-validate the detection results and
the TOS values marked by the ISPs (columns “Δtos” and “TOSδ”
in Table 3).
6.2 Validation with two-ended controlled
probing
As mentioned in §5, loss rate measured by TTL-based probing
could be affected by various types of noise. We perform two-ended
controlled probing to partially validate the content-based differen-
tiation results presented in the previous section. Given all the Plan-
etLab node pairs, we ﬁrst select a subset of them that traverse the
ISP internal paths with detected differentiation. In total, we found
13 such pairs, all traversing the internal paths of ISP12 with dif-
ferentiation against BitTorrent. Between each pair of nodes, we
simultaneously measure the one-way end-to-end loss rate as well
as the loss rate between ingress and egress of ISP12 with TTL-
based probing, using both HTTP and BitTorrent probes.
In Fig-
ure 8, the two curves labeled “one-way end-to-end” and “ingress-

tween HTTP and BitTorrent measured by two-ended controlled
probing and TTL-based probing respectively. Clearly, the two
curves match quite well, implying that the differentiation between
HTTP and BitTorrent can also be conﬁrmed by one-way loss rate
measurements.
6.3 Routing-based differentiation
Table 4 summarizes our ﬁndings for the 10 ISPs which appear
to carry out routing-based differentiation. For previous-hop AS
based differentiation, the “AS pairs” column shows the number and
percentage of previous-hop AS pairs in which differentiation is de-
tected. Clearly, previous-hop AS based differentiation is commonly
used by many ISPs, reﬂecting the fact that ISPs usually maintain
different business contracts with their customers and peers. The
number of previous-hop AS pairs exhibiting differentiation can be
as large as 1511 (30%) in ISP16 and 1086 (21%) in ISP3. In con-
trast, next-hop AS based differentiation is far less prevalent. Except
for ISP3, all the other ISPs studied show few cases of next-hop AS
based differentiation. This is likely due to the clear advantage of
previous-hop AS based approach in enabling an ISP to manage its
internal resources to meet its SLAs with customers and peers.
Following the similar logic in §6.1, we show that the detection
results indeed reﬂect previous-hop AS based differentiation per-
formed by the ISPs. We apply K-S test to path pairs that traverse
the same (preAS, ingress, egress, nxtAS), which are not sub-
ject to any routing-based differentiation. Thus, an acceptance of
the test indicates a false positive due to noise, as shown in the “FP”
column in Table 4. Under the conjecture that ISPs do not carry
out any previous-hop AS based differentiation, we deduce that: i)
the detection results in the previous-hop “AS pairs” column are all
“false positives”; ii) the percentage of false positive pairs results
from the K-S test should be independent of whether it is conducted
between the same previous-hop ASes (column “FP”) or between
different previous-hop ASes (column “AS pairs”). Nonetheless,
the percentage numbers in the “FP” column are negligibly small
compared to those in the previous-hop “AS pairs” column, contra-
dicting our conjecture. This again implies that the detection results
indeed reﬂect previous-hop AS based differentiation performed by
the ISPs, which we will further cross-validate in the next section
(columns “Δtos” and “TOSδ” in Table 4).
The neighbors of an ISP can generally be classiﬁed into cus-
tomers and peers based on whether the ISP receives payments from
them. ISPs may have incentives to give customer’s trafﬁc high pri-
ority. We employ the commonly-used relationship inference results
by Gao [16] to classify the previous-hop ASes into customers and
peers. Among all the previous-hop AS pairs consisting of one cus-
tomer and one peer, the “Customers” and “Peers” columns in Ta-
ble 4 shows the number of cases where customer’s trafﬁc receives
better or worse treatment respectively. Seven of the ten ISPs ei-
ther consistently or mostly give customer’s trafﬁc higher priority,
conﬁrming our conjecture.
6.4 Correlation with TOS value
As previously illustrated in §2, trafﬁc differentiation can be im-
plemented in the router by marking the TOS ﬁeld in the IP header.
We develop a method to reveal the TOS ﬁeld marked by the routers
along a path. We then study whether the observed trafﬁc differen-
tiation can be explained by different TOS values.
Our probe packets trigger ICMP time exceeded messages from
routers. These ICMP messages contain the IP header of the orig-
inal probe packets, including the TOS values set by the routers.
Table 5 illustrates an example of the TOS marking behavior of
content-based differentiation. It shows the traceroute output from
a PlanetLab node in University of Arizona traversing ISP12. The
“TOS” column shows the TOS value of original probe packets ex-
tracted from ICMP replies. It is clear that the TOS value of BitTor-
rent probes is set to 128 by the router at the sixth hop while that of
HTTP probes is always 0.
To correlate the loss rate differences with TOS value differences
in the trafﬁc, we ﬁrst need to infer the relationship between TOS
values and priorities. We assume an ISP has a consistent policy
of associating a TOS value with a ﬁxed priority. However, we do
not assume that a large TOS value is always associated with a high
priority. Starting with all the pairs that pass K-S test, we compile a
list of all the distinct TOS values observed in a target ISP. We then
construct a mapping from TOS values to priorities in a way such
that the loss rate differences between the pairs with differentiation
can be best explained. More speciﬁcally, given a pair with differ-
entiation, if the ﬁrst set has lower loss rates than the second set, the
TOS value of the former should map to higher priority.
Can TOS difference explain detected differentiation?
Once
a mapping is constructed for each ISP, we compute Δtos, which
is the percentage of pairs with detected differentiation that can be
explained by differences in priorities inferred from TOS values.
The results are in the “Δtos” columns in Tables 3 and 4, where
“-” means no TOS marking is used. Clearly, a large percentage
of pairs with detected differentiation can be explained by the pri-
ority differences inferred from TOS values. Δtos is 100% for all
the pairs with content-based differentiation (Table 3). For the pairs
with previous-hop AS based differentiation, Δtos is over 80% in 5
ISPs (Table 4). Note that Δtos is not 100% in some ISPs, which
could be caused by ISP’s “passive” differentiation. For instance,
an ISP may route the trafﬁc from a neighbor through an under-
provisioned link, persistently causing high loss rates, even though
the ISP does not “actively” treat the trafﬁc with low priority.
