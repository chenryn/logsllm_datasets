in traffic levels in both time windows (wt30/wt40). In the week after
the seizure, DNS requests fall to a global minimum. The overall
reduction is larger than 20% (red30/red40). No reduction could be
found for the IXP vantage point.
No significant reduction in attack volumes or number of sys-
tems attacked. A surprising finding of this work is that we find
significant reductions for traffic flowing to DDoS reflectors, but
no significant reduction in attack traffic from reflectors to victims,
or in the number of systems attacked. In order to minimize the
probability of false conclusions with respect to this finding, we use
the knowledge of NTP DDoS traffic characteristics from Section
4 to compose a filter for the number of systems under attack (see
Fig. 5). We isolate all IPs receiving NTP traffic with packets > 200
bytes packet size from more than ≤ 10 hosts with more than 1 Gbps
traffic peak. We do not find a significant reduction in the number
of systems attacked (wt30/wt40).
Takeaway. The traffic patterns observed show a correlation with the
FBI seizure. We find significant reductions in DDoS traffic to possible
DNS, NTP, and Memcached reflectors around the takedown operation.
Nevertheless, we could not find any significant reduction in traffic from
reflectors to victims. To exclude false positives, we use more reliable
filters for NTP DDoS learned from our self-attacks, which shows no
significant reduction after the takedown. We conclude that seizing the
front-end of Booter services does not improve the situation for DDoS
victims, as the underlying infrastructure of reflectors remains online
and can be utilized by third-parties without disruption.
6 CONCLUSIONS
This paper studies for the first time the effect of booter-based DDoS
attacks through the lens of a major IXP, a tier-1 ISP, and a tier-2
