### 4.3 TCP Performance for h-Hop Chain with a Single Flow

We analyze the performance of TCP in an equally spaced chain consisting of \( h+1 \) nodes (i.e., \( h \) hops) with a single flow. Each node is 200 meters apart from its adjacent nodes. The TCP packets travel along the chain from the leftmost node (the sender) to the rightmost node (the receiver). Figure 1 illustrates the h-hop chain topology with a single FTP flow and no cross traffic.

As observed in [5], successive packet transmissions of the single flow interfere with each other as they move along the chain. Specifically, a potential sending node \( i \) (where \( i = 4, 5, \ldots, h+1 \)) acts as a hidden terminal to an ongoing transmission from node \( i-3 \) to node \( i-2 \). Node \( i \) cannot detect the ongoing transmission from \( i-3 \) to \( i-2 \) and thus starts transmitting, leading to collisions. This hidden terminal effect occurs because the interference range of each node is much larger than its transmission range. Since the IEEE 802.11 protocol does not support global packet scheduling among all nodes, such effects are inevitable under standard IEEE 802.11 specifications.

In our first experiment, we evaluate TCP Vegas with different values of the parameter \( \beta \). The goal is to determine the optimal value of \( \beta \) for TCP Vegas without ACK thinning. Figures 2 to 4 present performance curves for TCP Vegas with \( \beta \) values ranging from 2 to 4.

- **Figure 2** shows that TCP Vegas with \( \beta = 2 \) achieves the highest goodput for chain lengths between 4 and 20 hops. For longer chains, the goodput is nearly equal for all \( \beta \) values.
- **Figure 3** indicates that the average TCP window size increases with increasing \( \beta \). Therefore, TCP Vegas with \( \beta = 2 \) has the smallest average window size.
- **Figure 4** plots the goodput in a 7-hop chain for different bandwidths. For a 2 Mbit/s bandwidth, TCP Vegas with \( \beta = 2 \) achieves the highest goodput. At 5.5 Mbit/s, TCP Vegas with \( \beta = 2 \) yields only slightly higher goodput than the other two variants. At 11 Mbit/s, all three TCP variants yield the same goodput.

We observe a sub-linear growth in goodput with increasing bandwidth. This is due to the IEEE 802.11 specifications, which require RTS, CTS, and ACK control packets to be sent at 1 Mbit/s, regardless of the data packet bandwidth, to ensure compatibility between different IEEE 802.11 versions. Consequently, the relative overhead for sending control packets on the MAC layer increases with the data rate.
