Hello,

I'm writing to report an issue with IntelliSense functionality in version 0.10.10. After downloading TypeScript, IntelliSense is not working for the modules I have installed via npm, such as Express and Firebase. However, in version 0.10.08, IntelliSense works perfectly without any issues.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
