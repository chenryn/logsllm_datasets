User: My code is broken by eclipse but works normaly if I launch it from command prompt with python and no option. I need to delete -u option when the python interpreter is launched in eclipse and pydev, how can I do that?
Assistant: Actually, so far you can't do that without grabbing the code and changing it yourself (i.e.: that's hardcoded).
But still, if you don't use the unbuffered output (i.e.: -u option), the PyDev console will end up not showing the I/O output as it's printed (as it'll be buffered).
So, what is it that breaks because -u? (maybe it'd be better fixing that then changing PyDev to launch without the -u as you may end up without the output until the run is finished if you do that).
