AFAICT it's impossible to use a **variable** for _ignore_errors_
### Given
    vars:
        ignore_err: no
### Solution Attempts
Interpreted as a string, so always true:
    ignore_errors: $ignore_err
Dito:
    ignore_errors: {{ ignore_err }}
Illegal YAML syntax:
    ignore_errors: {{ ignore_err | bool }}
String again...:
    ignore_errors: "{{ ignore_err | bool }}"
Maybe I'm stupid, but I can't see how to do this. I had to duplicate the task
with one ignore_errors: yes and one no and control it with a when...
