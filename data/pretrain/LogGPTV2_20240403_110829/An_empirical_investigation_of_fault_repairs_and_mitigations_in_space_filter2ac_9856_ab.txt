#### Anonymity and Data Preservation
To maintain anonymity, the information necessary for classifying the associated faults and their mitigating actions has been preserved.

#### First Failure Report: BOH (Mitigated by Source Code Change)
The first failure report in Table II describes a BOH (On-Board Handling) issue that was resolved by modifying the source code. 

**Description of Incident:**
- The initial telemetry from on-board software Version XX indicated that the Emergency Antenna was set to value B, which should be value A. Communication at this point in the mission was not possible with value B.
- If the spacecraft executed Safing, it would require the Command Loss Response Algorithm to swap the antenna configuration to value A to re-establish communication.

**Analysis, Verification, and Real-Time Action:**
- A real-time command was sent to change the RAM configuration to value A (Prime String Only).
- The Online String is currently running Version YY with a RAM value of value A.
- Both Version YY and Version XX in on-board storage require an update to make the Emergency Antenna value A.
- On mm-dd-yyyy, commands were sent to patch the FSW (Flight Software) loads on both on-board storage devices.

**Final Corrective Action and Fault Mitigation Classification:**
- All FSW copies now contain the correct Safing antenna value.
- The update of the Emergency Antenna parameter is being addressed by PFR WWWW, and this anomaly report can be closed.

#### Second Failure Report: BOH (Mitigated by Workaround)
The second failure report also describes a BOH issue, but this one was mitigated using a workaround rather than a fix.

**Description of Incident:**
- After the completion of an on-board operation, a file that was expected to have been deleted was found to remain in the spacecraft file system.

**Analysis, Verification, and Real-Time Action:**
- A new command was written and tested to delete the file from the flyby spacecraft.
- The source code indicates that AutoNav should handle this contingency by ignoring any observation from the opnav file that precedes the beginning of the odfile and issuing an error report.
- A procedural workaround was developed to ensure that operations engineers delete the file after the completion of each such on-board operation by transmitting the appropriate command to the spacecraft.

**Final Corrective Action and Fault Mitigation Classification:**
- The AutoNav Uplink Checklist now includes an item to check that each AutoNav activity has a command to delete the file afterwards.

#### Third and Fourth Failure Reports: NAM (Mitigated by Source Code Change and Workaround)
The next two failures were caused by NAM (Non-Autonomous Mode) issues.

**First NAM (Mitigated by Source Code Change):**
- **Description of Incident:**
  - Unacceptable conflicts in the ADCS (Attitude Determination and Control System) configuration due to unexpected activity in the repair sequence.
- **Analysis, Verification, and Real-Time Action:**
  - Initial assessment indicated that FP (Fault Protection) responses stop the critical sequence, but since COMPONENT NAME autonomously kicks off sequences that perform Activity Type A, these end up running in parallel.
  - Detailed analysis and testing identified the root cause and a code change was implemented.
- **Final Corrective Action and Fault Mitigation Classification:**
  - The MCR (Mission Change Request) was implemented in FSW VV and loaded on the S/C on mm-dd-yyyy.
  - The change is benign on the flyby as the flyby does not use the mode manager for delta-v execution.

**Second NAM (Mitigated by Workaround):**
- **Description of Incident:**
  - One of the instruments on the spacecraft produced anomalous data.
- **Analysis, Verification, and Real-Time Action:**
  - Detailed analysis of the instrumentâ€™s software and method of operation identified previously unknown circumstances under which this failure would occur.
- **Final Corrective Action and Fault Mitigation Classification:**
  - A procedural workaround was developed to re-initialize the instrument using a "Fast Housekeeping" command, setting all conditions to a known state.
  - This problem has not been observed since the procedures have been revised.

#### Fifth Failure Report: ARB (Mitigated by Fix)
The final failure was due to an ARB (Autonomous Reboot) issue that was mitigated with a fix.

**Description of Incident:**
- The instrument software had a gradual stack overflow that eventually stopped the production of a specific type of downlink telemetry.

**Analysis, Verification, and Real-Time Action:**
- The operations team identified and reproduced the problem.
- A modified version of the flight software was uplinked to the instrument.

**Final Corrective Action and Fault Mitigation Classification:**
- The FSW version Y runs stable over many months, and the problem has not recurred.
- It is recommended to close this anomaly report.

#### Classification and Frequency Analysis
The classification of the mitigating actions resulting from each failure occurrence was based on the descriptions provided. This process was conducted in parallel by two individuals, and any disagreements were resolved through detailed analysis and discussion. In approximately 1/3 of the cases, the initial classifications did not match, but a consensus was ultimately reached.
