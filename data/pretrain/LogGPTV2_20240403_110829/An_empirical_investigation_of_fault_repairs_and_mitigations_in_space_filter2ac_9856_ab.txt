All FSW copies now contain the correct
Saﬁng antenna value. Update of the
Emergency Antenna parameter is being
addressed by PFR WWWW and this
anomaly report can be closed.
A real-time command was sent to the
spacecraft to change the RAM conﬁgu-
ration to value A. (Prime String Only)
The Online String is currently running
Version YY with a RAM value of value
A. Both Version YY and Version XX in
on-board storage require an update to
make the Emergency Antenna value A.
On mm-dd-yyyy commands were sent
to patch the FSW loads on both on-
board storage devices.
New command written and tested to
delete ﬁle from the ﬂyby spacecraft.
Source code indicates AutoNav should
handle this contingency – if an ob-
servation from opnav ﬁle precedes the
beginning of the odﬁle, then the obser-
vation should be ignored and an error
report issued. We are playing it safe by
deleting the ﬁle.
Conﬁrmed that there is a sneak path
in the software logic for a latent type
A request to be fulﬁlled in the mid-
dle of a fault response. FSW SCR
XXXX was opened to implement a
software ﬁx to prevent this from occur-
ring. Will retest with faulted COMPO-
NENT NAME encounter runs.
Initial
telemetry from on-board soft-
ware Version XX indicated that Emer-
gency Antenna was set to value B. This
parameter in System Fault Protection
should be value A. Uplink and Down-
link communication at this point in the
mission is not possible with value B. If
the spacecraft executed Saﬁng at this
time, it would require the Command
Loss Response Algorithm to execute
an antenna conﬁguration swap to value
A in order to communicate with the
spacecraft. (About TT time).
A ﬁle named “ﬁlename” was found on
the Flyby ﬁle system as we prepared for
the planet watch activity. Prior AutoNav
activities are supposed to conclude by
copying and deleting this ﬁle – opnav
ﬁle should not exist at the beginning of
an AutoNav activity. Directory times-
tamp indicates opnav ﬁle was modiﬁed
on the preceding planet watch activity.
estimate
the FP attitude
Starting with SEQ SEQ NAME, there
is much unexpected activity (looks
like
re-
pair sequence), apparently competing
with the sequences SEQ NAME and
SEQ NAME2, because the commands
are interleaved. This causes unaccept-
able conﬂicts in the ADCS conﬁgu-
ration. Initial assessment
is that FP
responses stop the critical sequence,
but since COMPONENT NAME au-
tonomously kicks off
the sequences
that speciﬁcally perform the Activ-
these end up running
ity Type A’s,
in parallel. For example,
the below
set of commands (from the integrated
log for
test X) shows a COMPO-
NENT 2 power cycle at time T1, but
a delta-v is still commanded at time
T2. This is completely inconsistent
with the COMPONENT NAME Activ-
ity Type A design, and known time it
takes for COMPONENT 2 to perform
a warm re-start. (test log follows)
Instrument A suddenly
produced
anomalous housekeeping data at about
mm-dd-yyyy hh:mm:ss.
Analysis of instrument operation and
instrument data and ﬂight software
showed that this is an artifact of the
current instrument FSW, which causes
this anomaly under certain conditions.
hh:mm:ss
On mm-dd-yyyy
Instru-
ment A stopped generating valid HK
and science packets. The last valid HK
packet received indicated nominal in-
strument. After successful FSW check-
out, HK SW status counters indicated
two FSW exceptions. After the FSW
load no valid science packets were gen-
erated until the CPU-reset command,
after which both nominal HK and sci-
ence data were generated. But then at
mm-dd-yyyy hh:mm:ss the instrument
stopped producing valid HK.
(Telemetry log excerpt) The CPU-Reset
command was uplinked at mm-dd-yyyy
hh:mm:ss. Operation as expected until
mm-dd-yyyy hh:mm:ss the instrument
stopped producing valid HK only. The
instrument software onboard has been
compared with the ground SW. No dif-
ference has been identiﬁed. The FSW
version X behavior is reproducible on
ground: After many hours, no HK pack-
ets are written to the RTIU. Assump-
tion: The program stack has been too
full.
mm-dd-yyyy AutoNav Uplink Check-
list now has an item to check that each
AutoNav activity has a command to
delete the ﬁle afterwards.

Workaround
This MCR was implemented in FSW
VV, and loaded on the S/C on mm-
dd-yyyy. MCR YYYY to be included
in FSW VV Text of MCR below -
Change/Command Requested: Bracket
Encounter System Saﬁng (Return to
point) with mode block for delta-
v. Reason for Change/Command: On
the COMPONENT NAME,
transition
to delta-v state is done via an asyn-
chronous sequence call
from mode
manager. Faulted testing has show it
possible for an Activity Type A to oc-
cur in the middle of point state re-
covery. Note there is a code change
involved with this MCR. However, the
change is benign on the ﬂyby as the
ﬂyby does not use the mode manager
for delta-v execution. Impact if Not Im-
plemented: Unstable performance, im-
properly executed delta-v maneuver.
Possible mission degradation. Imple-
mentation Approach: (Implementation
details follow).
A procedural work-around has been de-
veloped which has ﬁxed this problem.
Instrument is re-initialized using a “Fast
Housekeeping” command, which sets
all conditions to a known state. This
problem has not been observed since
the procedures have been revised.
This was a ﬂight software related issue.
We found some inconsistencies within
the FSW code and did according cor-
rections. Now the FSW version Y runs
stable over many months. We did not
have this problem again. Recommend
closure of this anomaly report.

sequence encountered an unexpected value for one of the
parameters it read from RAM;
the problem was repaired
by changing the value of the parameter stored in spacecraft
memory. The second failure report also describes a BOH;
however, this one was mitigated using a workaround rather
than a ﬁx. After the completion of an on-board operation, a
ﬁle that was expected to have been deleted was found to have
remained in the spacecraft ﬁle system. Rather than modifying
the on-board software to ensure intermediate ﬁle deletion,
a workaround was developed to ensure that the operations
engineers delete it after the completion of each such on-
board operation by transmitting the appropriate command to
the spacecraft. The next two failures had each been caused
by a NAM. The ﬁrst one was mitigated by modifying the
source code – the fault is a complicated one involving the
potential
interleaving of instructions in different on-board
sequences in such a way that the ability of the spacecraft
to achieve its science goals could be seriously degraded. In
this case, the severity of the consequences was high enough
to warrant repairing the fault; the operations engineers were
able to develop an understanding of the failure mechanism
with enough conﬁdence, which enabled them to make the ﬁx.
The second NAM was mitigated with a workaround: One of
the instruments on the spacecraft produced anomalous data;
detailed analysis of the instrument’s software and method of
operation identiﬁed previously unknown circumstances under
which this failure would occur. The failure was deemed to
be sufﬁciently infrequent, and to not threaten the mission’s
overall science goals so a workaround was determined to
be sufﬁciently effective and involve less risk than a change
to the source code. The ﬁnal failure had been due to an
ARB that was mitigated with a ﬁx – apparently the on-
board software for an instrument had a gradual stack overﬂow
that eventually stopped the production of a speciﬁc type of
downlink telemetry. The operations team was able to identify
and reproduce the problem, and then uplink a modiﬁed version
of the ﬂight software to the instrument.
The classiﬁcation of the mitigating actions resulting from
each failure occurrence was based on such descriptions. It
was conducted in parallel by two persons. After that, the
classiﬁcations were compared to resolve disagreements. In
approximately 1/3 of the cases, the initial classiﬁcations by
the two individuals did not match. In these cases, a detailed
analysis was conducted by the two individuals to achieve a
consensus. In all the cases, both investigators were able to
reach a ﬁnal classiﬁcation agreement.
IV. MITIGATION TYPE FREQUENCY ANALYSIS
Based on the above classiﬁcation, we categorized the failure
reports related to the ﬂight software of the JPL/NASA missions
as shown in Table III. The ﬁrst column in this table lists
20 distinct Corrective Action Sets, each of which contains
one or more instances of one or more of the types of
mitigating actions deﬁned in Table I. A Corrective Action
Set simply identiﬁes the types of mitigating actions associated
with the disposition of an individual failure report. From left
