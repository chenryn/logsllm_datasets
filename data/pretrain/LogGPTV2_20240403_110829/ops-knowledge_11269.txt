To effectively implement CIS Control 18.3, which focuses on remediating penetration test findings, an organization should follow these main procedures:

1. **Define Remediation Scope and Prioritization:**
   - Establish a clear policy that outlines the scope and prioritization of remediation efforts. This policy should consider the criticality of the assets, the severity of the vulnerabilities, and the potential impact on the organization.

2. **Conduct Thorough Analysis:**
   - Analyze the results of the penetration tests to understand the nature and extent of the identified vulnerabilities. This includes categorizing the findings based on their severity and potential impact.

3. **Develop a Remediation Plan:**
   - Create a detailed plan for addressing the identified vulnerabilities. The plan should include specific actions, responsible parties, timelines, and resources required for each remediation task.

4. **Implement the Remediation:**
   - Execute the remediation plan by applying patches, updating configurations, or making other necessary changes to address the vulnerabilities. Ensure that the remediation activities are performed in a controlled and secure manner to avoid introducing new risks.

5. **Verify the Effectiveness:**
   - After implementing the remediation, conduct follow-up testing to verify that the vulnerabilities have been successfully addressed. This may involve re-running the penetration tests or using other validation methods.

6. **Document and Report:**
   - Document the entire remediation process, including the findings, actions taken, and the results of the verification. Provide a comprehensive report to stakeholders, highlighting the improvements made and any remaining areas of concern.

CIS Control 18.3 is categorized under the "Network" asset type and falls within the "Protect" security function, emphasizing the importance of safeguarding the network infrastructure from identified vulnerabilities.
