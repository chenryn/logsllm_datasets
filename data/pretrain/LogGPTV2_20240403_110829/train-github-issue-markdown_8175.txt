# Description of the New Feature/Enhancement
The new feature will include a "Reset Settings" option, allowing users to revert all settings to their default values.

# Proposed Technical Implementation Details (Optional)
To implement this feature, we can:
1. **Store Default Values**: Maintain a set of default configuration values.
2. **Reset Functionality**: Develop a function that restores all user-modifiable settings to these default values.
3. **User Interface Integration**: Add a "Reset Settings" button in the settings menu, which triggers the reset functionality when clicked.
4. **Confirmation Prompt**: Include a confirmation dialog to ensure that users do not accidentally reset their settings.
5. **Logging and Notifications**: Log the reset action for auditing purposes and provide a notification to the user confirming that the settings have been reset.

This approach ensures that the feature is both user-friendly and robust, providing a seamless experience for users who need to revert to default settings.
