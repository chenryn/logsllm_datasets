Assistant: According to the above monitoring indicators, it can be seen that the possibility of system failure is very high. The specific analysis and solutions are as follows: 1. CPU usage: 75% The current CPU usage is high, but it has not yet reached the overload state. If the CPU usage continues to increase, the system may be overloaded. Therefore, it is necessary to further observe the trend of the CPU usage and take timely measures, such as optimizing process resource scheduling or upgrading hardware. 2. Memory usage: 90% The current memory usage is high and is close to the limit. If the memory usage continues to increase, the system will not run normally, so it is necessary to release memory resources or increase memory capacity in time to avoid system crashes. 3. System interruption rate: 100/s The current system interruption rate is too high, which may be caused by program errors, equipment failures or other problems. It is necessary to further analyze the cause of the error and take measures to repair it. Before repairing, you can try to restart the system to Eliminate errors. 4. Disk I/O utilization rate: 60% The disk I/O utilization rate is within an appropriate range, but if the amount of data continues to increase, the data transmission speed may be too slow, causing a bottleneck. Therefore, the performance of disk I/O should be adjusted according to business needs, such as upgrading disks or performing system optimization. 5. Network traffic: 100Mb/s The current network traffic is within the normal range, but in high traffic conditions, delays and other issues may occur. Therefore, adjustments need to be made according to changes in network traffic, such as increasing bandwidth or optimizing network topology. In short, to discover and solve system failures in a timely manner, it is necessary to comprehensively consider the above monitoring indicators, analyze the reasons, and take corresponding effective measures to deal with them in time to ensure the stability and normal operation of the system.
