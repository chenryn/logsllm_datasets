User: It seems obvious that it would use the twisted names api and not any blocking way to resolve host names.
However digging in the source code, I have been unable to find the place where the name resolution occurs. Could someone point me to the relevant source code where the host resolution occurs ( when trying to do a connectTCP, for example).
I really need to be sure that connectTCP wont use blocking DNS resolution.
Assistant: I'm not massively familiar with twisted, I only recently started used it. It looks like it doesn't block though, but only on platforms that support threading.
In twisted.internet.base in ReactorBase it looks like it does the resolving through it's resolve method which returns a deferred from self.resolver.getHostByName.
self.resolver is an instance of BlockingResolver by default which does block, but it looks like that if the platform supports threading the resolver instance is replaced by ThreadedResolver in the ReactorBase._initThreads method.
