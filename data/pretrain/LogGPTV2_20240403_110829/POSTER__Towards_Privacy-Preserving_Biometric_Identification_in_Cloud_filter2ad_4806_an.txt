### Management Applications and Surveillance-Oriented Models

The authentication accuracy in these models is achieved through the use of physically uncorrelated biometrics, which can significantly improve performance even when the quality of the samples is sub-optimal.

### Limitations

A key limitation of our model is related to interoperability issues, particularly concerning the matching sensors used by different service providers. Biometric data is typically matched using sensors from various manufacturers, which restricts the ability to fuse templates from disparate sensors. This challenge highlights the need for standardization and the use of similar types of sensors, which can be costly and resource-intensive. Additionally, the system may be affected by the constraints imposed by the use of Multi-Party Computation (MPC). For instance, a viable protocol might prefer the use of Hamming distance for simplicity, avoiding the complexity of floating-point arithmetic.

### Conclusion and Discussion

We present a model for privacy-preserving fusion in a non-traditional but realistic distrustful environment. Our approach incorporates multiple biometric traits for cloud-based identity authentication and leverages MPC techniques to ensure privacy. Multimodal fusion generally provides better results than single-matching modules in terms of security and reliability. It is evident that biometric fusion plays a critical role in identification systems, with different fusion mechanisms yielding varying outcomes based on the combination of data, rules, and tools. However, achieving optimal retrieval performance can be challenging. Identity-focused biometric databases for online authentication mechanisms pose significant risks from various perspectives. MPC helps mitigate the misuse of private biometric information, making it suitable for real-world applications. Future solutions addressing these challenges could enhance the feasibility of large-scale, privacy-enhancing biometric identity management technologies.

**Abstract:**
The widespread use of biometric architectures necessitates securing highly sensitive data to respect user privacy rights. This paper explores the extent to which biometric designs can be characterized as Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs). We define privacy and security terms for biometric schemes and present current regulations for protecting biometric information. We also analyze and compare cryptographic techniques for secure biometric designs. Finally, we introduce a privacy-preserving approach for biometric authentication in mobile electronic financial applications, utilizing pseudonymous biometric identities for secure user registration and authentication. This work aims to contribute to the development of privacy-by-design biometric technologies.

### 1. Introduction

Biometric systems that recognize a user's identity based on their characteristics are becoming increasingly prevalent. From fingerprint scanners in smartphones to border control infrastructures, the extensive use of biometric authentication has heightened security and privacy concerns. While biometrics were initially introduced to overcome the limitations of traditional authentication methods like passwords or tokens, they rely on who a person is or what they do, potentially revealing more information than necessary. State-of-the-art cryptographic techniques enhance the security of biometric designs, but implementing these requirements remains challenging. The European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has set new standards for processing biometric information, emphasizing the need for privacy-aware approaches. This paper addresses recent privacy regulations and advances in cryptography for secure biometric designs, introducing a privacy-preserving biometric authentication model for eFinance applications.

**Our Contribution:**
- Analyze privacy-preserving cryptographic techniques according to ISO privacy principles and GDPR.
- Present a biometric authentication model for eFinance applications based on pseudonymous biometric identities.
- Evaluate the proposal following the ISO security framework for financial services and discuss how privacy requirements can be met during implementation.

### 2. Definitions

#### 2.1 Privacy
In the era of the Internet of Things, the growing utility of biometric technologies in cloud applications has led to the aggregation of personal data from multiple sources, raising public skepticism. Users are concerned about the collection and sharing of biometric data without their consent, especially in government designs like border control systems. Privacy for biometrics is a fundamental right, and there is an increasing pace of regulation development to protect this right.

#### 2.2 Security
Security in biometric architectures refers to the technical robustness of the system and the protection mechanisms against direct and indirect attacks. Although legislation has strengthened, it is often insufficient to preserve privacy. Cryptographic techniques, such as biometric template protection, have been introduced to address these limitations. A privacy-by-design approach that combines cryptography and respects privacy principles is considered optimal for enhancing both security and user privacy in biometric schemes.

### 3. Privacy Principles and Security Regulations

International and national standards establish criteria for configuring processes, tools, and systems to ensure the security of personal data. For biometric designs, these standards specify formats for data interchange, platform independence, program interfaces, and application profiles. ISO standards set general guidelines for systems, tokens, smart cards, and cybersecurity architectures. They define principles of limitation, minimization, accuracy, completeness, transparency, and rectification for personal data processing. Security requirements include confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, availability, and non-repudiation. Additional recommendations for biometric applications include anonymity, unobservability, revocability, cancelability, non-invertibility, unlinkability, and discriminability. The new term "renewability" has been added to ISO security recommendations, highlighting the need for re-enrollment and the permanence of stored data.

### 4. Literature Review

This section reviews existing cryptographic approaches for enhancing the security of biometric designs and preserving user privacy. These approaches include Template Protection Schemes, Biometric Cryptosystems, and Pseudonymous Biometric Identities.

#### 4.1 Features Transformation
Biometric template protection involves transforming data to prevent leakage. The mechanism transforms the template data before storing it, making it difficult for intruders to retrieve the genuine biometric feature. While this technique offers reliable security, complex transformations can reduce performance, especially in multibiometric designs.

#### 4.2 Cancelable Biometrics
Cancelable or revocable biometrics allow multiple transformed biometric templates, providing higher security levels. This approach covers non-invertibility and revocability but does not preserve renewability. Human characteristics can change over time, leading to high False Rejection Rates (FRR) and decreased system performance.

#### 4.3 Biometric Cryptosystems
Biometric cryptosystems combine cryptographic functions to derive keys from biometric data. There are two main schemes: key-generation and key-binding. Key-generation directly creates keys from biometric features, while key-binding stores information from the combination of biometric data with randomly generated keys. Both schemes are fuzzy, making them suitable for large-scale databases and high-robustness applications. However, they can affect flexibility and are less effective for anonymous database models.

### 5. Background

#### 5.1 Pseudonymous Biometric Identities
Pseudonymous identities from biometric samples are a recent development in privacy-preserving cryptographic approaches. The mechanism utilizes non-invertible transformations to create renewable pseudo-identities, ensuring privacy and security in biometric applications.
