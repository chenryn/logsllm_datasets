management applications and surveillance oriented models. The authentication
accuracy is based on utilizing physically uncorrelated biometrics that can present
signiﬁcant improvements at performance, even when the quality of the samples
is sub-optimal.
Limitations: One clear limitation of our model is related to interoperability
issues, regarding the matching sensors of the involved service providers. This is
due to the fact that biometric data is usually matched by sensors produced by
diﬀerent manufactures, this proposal is restricted in its ability to fuse templates
originating from disparate sensors. For that reason, one of the major challenges
in the biometrics recognition domain is the use of similar types of sensors,
establishing a common technological behavior, something that reﬂects eﬀort and
cost ineﬀectiveness. Moreover, the system might be aﬀected by the restrictions
put in place by the use of MPC, for instance, a viable protocol might prefer
the use of Hamming distance for simplicity and avoid the use of ﬂoating point
arithmetic.
CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION

5 Conclusion and Discussion
We present a model for privacy-preserving fusion in a non-traditional, but reality
representative distrustful environment. We incorporate multiple biometric traits,
for cloud-based identity authentication, and make use of MPC techniques to
oﬀer privacy. Moreover, multimodal fusion gives better results than using a
single matching module in the context of security and reliability. In general, it
is indisputable that biometrics fusion has a critical role to play in identiﬁcation
systems and diﬀerent fusion mechanisms work diﬀerently for every combination
of data, rules and tools, while optimality is conﬂicting with regard to the
retrieval performance rates. Furthermore, identity-purposed biometric DBs
for online authentication mechanisms, seriously enhance risks from diﬀerent
perspectives and for each assessment separately. MPC restricts the misuses of
private biometric information at the levels required by realistic applications.
Future solutions for these major issues can support the feasibility of large-scale
privacy-enhancing biometric identity management technologies.

Abstract. Widespread use of biometric architectures implies the
need to secure highly sensitive data to respect the privacy rights of
the users. In this paper, we discuss the following question: To what
extent can biometric designs be characterized as Privacy Enhancing
Technologies? The terms of privacy and security for biometric
schemes are deﬁned while current regulations for the protection of
biometric information are presented. Additionally, we analyze and
compare cryptographic techniques for secure biometric designs.
Finally, we introduce a privacy-preserving approach for biometric
authentication in mobile electronic ﬁnancial applications. Our
model utilizes the mechanism of pseudonymous biometric identities
for secure user registration and authentication. We discuss how
the privacy requirements for the processing of biometric data can
be met in our scenario. This work attempts to contribute to the
development of privacy-by-design biometric technologies.

Introduction
Systems that automatically recognize a user’s identity based on his biometric
characteristics are becoming increasingly prevalent or even compulsive. From
ﬁngerprint scanners, embedded in smart mobile phones, to border control
infrastructures, the extensive use of biometric authentication applications has
increased the security and privacy concerns [167]. Speciﬁcally, security and
privacy are two diﬀerent complementary ﬁelds [39]. Biometrics were initially
introduced as a technology that overcomes the security limitations of the
traditional authentication approaches, such as passwords or tokens [68]. However,
biometric recognition relies on who a person is, or what someone does [99]. Hence,
biometric data may reveal more information about the user than necessary [122].

PRIVACY-PRESERVING BIOMETRIC AUTHENTICATION MODEL FOR EFINANCE APPLICATIONS
State-of-the-art in cryptographic techniques presents concrete mechanisms that
enhance the security of biometric designs [39]. The research focus on testing the
approaches towards malicious adversaries, and evaluating the implementation in
realistic scenarios [149]. Furthermore, the users’ fundamental right to privacy has
been internationally established and legally supported [115]. Security frameworks
standardize the developments while privacy principles conﬁrm biometric data
sources, ensuring that they are accurate and consistent [166]. However, adopting
the procedures and implementing these requirements are challenging tasks [63].
Cryptography has oﬀered privacy-aware approaches, addressing the practical
diﬃculties on the design of biometric schemes [99,144]. In 2016, the European
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) [66] has set new recommendations
for the processing of biometric information. The criteria should be addressed
from the early stage of the design, characterizing the architecture, and thus
determining the user acceptance, as these are addressed in ISO [96].
Achieving eﬀective and privacy-aware means of authentication has been a long-
recognized issue of biometric security [45]. While passwords are still dominant,
current implementations exhibit a much greater diversity of architectures,
particularly in relation to those used on mobile devices [146]. Nowadays, secret-
based schemes that combine PIN codes and biometrics are widely implemented
in electronic ﬁnancial applications, achieving great public acceptance [19]. This
paper addresses the very recent privacy regulations for biometric data and
the advances in the ﬁeld of cryptography for secure biometric designs. We
deﬁne the terms of privacy and security for biometric designs and discuss the
current legal framework. Additionally, we analyze the security measures and
privacy-preserving cryptographic techniques found in the literature. Finally, due
to the rapid deployment of biometric-based access control systems for electronic
ﬁnancial and payment purposes, we introduce a privacy-preserving biometric
authentication model for eFinance applications.
Our contribution is as follows:
• We analyze the advantages and limitations of privacy-preserving crypto-
graphic techniques according to the current ISO privacy principles for
biometric information protection [92] and the new security recommenda-
tions of the new European GDPR [66].
• We present a biometric authentication model for eFinance applications,
based on the privacy-preserving cryptographic technique of pseudonymous
biometric identities.
• We evaluate our proposal following the ISO security framework for ﬁnancial
services [94]. We discuss how the privacy requirements, presented in
ISO [95] can be satisﬁed during the technical implementation.

Union, such as TURBINE [215] and FIDELITY [67].
2 Deﬁnitions
2.1 Privacy
In the age of the Internet of Things, the growing utility of biometric technologies
in cloud applications has enabled the aggregation of personal data from multiple
sources [19]. This has resulted in a constant criticism, inﬂuencing negatively the
public opinion [99]. Users are skeptical, especially when they cannot prevent the
biometric registration in an access control scheme. For instance, government
designs, such as border control systems that demand the collection of biometric
data without the permission of their users [99]. This information can be
gathered and shared for ambiguous and unintended purposes, without any oﬃcial
approval [115]. It is a common belief that even when a procedure is performed
by a legislative authority, the collection of such a personal data unjustiﬁably
violates the human rights [39]. Privacy for biometrics is a basic user’s right in
a society where anonymity is considered as an inalienable privilege [99]. Thus,
during the last decade, there is an accelerated pace of regulations development
for the legal transmission of biometric data in government and industrial
schemes [45]. Through legislation, European and International organizations
emphasize the importance of privacy for biometric systems [166]. These activities
are analytically discussed in Section 3.
2.2 Security
The concept of security for biometric architectures refers to the technical
characteristics of the system and it is related to its overall robustness [39]. The
protection mechanisms are classiﬁed based on the vulnerable points, where direct
and indirect attacks on a biometric recognition scheme may occur [171]. After
2001, complete collections of targeted attacks and possible security measures
have been presented [139,151,212]. Although the legislation to protect biometric
data has been strengthened, the current legal regime is believed to be insuﬃcient
to preserve privacy [99]. As a supplementary response to that call, cryptographic
techniques have managed to decrease the security limitations of biometric
schemes through biometric template protection mechanisms [166]. Architectures
that are more complex based on the combinations of multibiometrics and
98
PRIVACY-PRESERVING BIOMETRIC AUTHENTICATION MODEL FOR EFINANCE APPLICATIONS
passwords or tokens have been introduced while extra attention has been paid
to anti-spooﬁng measures [176]. A privacy-by-design approach that combines
cryptography and respects the privacy principles is considered to be the optimal
option for enhancing both security and user’s privacy in biometric schemes [115].
Sections 4 and 5 present the most recent privacy-preserving cryptographic tools.
3 Privacy Principles and Security Regulations
For every given technology, international and national standards establish the
criteria for the conﬁguration of a process, tool or system [115]. In this way,
the applicability is resolved according to the requirements that deﬁne the
security for user’s personal data. To such a degree, a common toolkit speciﬁes
the privacy metrics to avoid any misunderstanding among developers and
users. For biometric designs, standards specify the formats for the interchange
of private data, the platform independence, program interfaces, application
proﬁles, calculations and tests for the results [45,99]. Hence, the architecture is
neutral, without being in favor of any particular vendor or modality [66,96].
In terms of security, ISO standards set the general guidelines for systems, tokens,
smart cards, authentication employments, identity management designs and
cyber-security architectures [19]. In the context of privacy for biometric data,
they deﬁne the principles of limitation, minimization, accuracy, completeness,
transparency and rectiﬁcation that regulate the process of personal data and
provide suitable formats for the development of the procedures [96]. The security
requirements of conﬁdentiality, integrity, authenticity, availability and non-
repudiation should be met for every system that is linked to the network [96,151].
Supplementary security recommendations for biometric applications report
the properties of anonymity, unobservability, revocability, cancelability, non-
invertibility, unlinkability and discriminability [39]. They referred mainly to the
data transmission and distribution and the prohibitions towards the parties [92].
Recently, the term of renewability [96] has been added to the ISO security
recommendations for privacy-preserving biometric designs [66]. It is considered
the most challenging regulation as it indicates the necessity of a user’s re-
enrollment in a system for updating his data. Permanence is also included in the
new recommendations. It determines the validity period of the stored data while
it guarantees the uniqueness of an attribute. The new regulation is focused on
the importance of privacy-by-design, underlining that as biometric technology
matures, the interaction increases among users, markets, and the technology
itself [66].

4 Literature Review
In this section, we present the existing cryptographic approaches that have been
proposed for enhancing the security of biometric designs and preserving the
privacy of user’s sensitive data. The literature analyzes the privacy weaknesses in
biometric schemes and suggests ways to secure the implementation process [6,144,
149]. The approaches include: Template Protection Schemes, Biometric
Cryptosystems and Pseudonymous Biometric Identities [39]. The ﬁrst
category includes Features Transformation Mechanisms and Cancelable
Biometrics.
4.1 Features Transformation
Biometric template protection as a term refers to the techniques where data is
transformed to prevent a possible leakage [151]. The mechanism transforms the
template data extracted from the freshly captured biometric before storing it.
Thus, the template stored in the DB is strongly protected with a goal that it
would be almost impossible to retrieve the genuine biometric feature from the
template [39]. In case of attacks, it is computationally hard for an intruder to
ﬁnd the function that was initially applied to the biometric data [124]. Although
the technique oﬀers reliable security, a recent analysis concludes that complex
transformations may reduce the performance [149]. The mechanism can be
utilized in unibiometric and multibiometric templates. However, multibiometric
designs demand more complex parameters and it is not possible to apply one-
way functions with a high cryptographic security level. Consequently, it is very
challenging to make this approach compliant with the privacy recommendations
of non-invertibility and discriminability.
4.2 Cancelable Biometrics
Inducing the privacy recommendations of cancelability and revocability in
biometric systems [96], being presented in Section 3, the purpose is the
user’s data protection, under a threat scenario, by composing quotation to
biometric templates [39,139]. The method of cancelable or revocable biometrics
is introduced as the ﬁrst privacy-preserving mechanism for biometric schemes
that respects these privacy properties for biometric information [171]. The
mechanism allows multiple transformed biometric templates, oﬀering higher
security levels. One of the basic objectives is the diversity that provides a larger
number of protected templates from the same features and it prevents the use of
the same references across the variety of applications. The recommendations of
100 PRIVACY-PRESERVING BIOMETRIC AUTHENTICATION MODEL FOR EFINANCE APPLICATIONS
non-invertibility and revocability are covered, since this approach demands
the re-issuance of biometrics after an attack [111]. However, the privacy
recommendation of renewability introduced in [66] is not preserved. Human
characteristics may change during time or due to other interferences, such as
an injury. In this scenario, the biometric scheme presents high False Rejection
Rates (FRR) and system’s performance is decreased, being vulnerable to
intruders [146].
4.3 Biometric Cryptosystems
Biometric cryptosystems or shortly crypto-biometrics belong to the second
category of privacy-preserving techniques for the protection of biometric data.
They combine cryptographic encryption and decryption functions to derive
keys from biometric data [39]. Mainly, there are two schemes that named
after their role as key-generation and key-binding schemes [6]. For the ﬁrst
group of the classiﬁcation, biometric feature directly creates the generated
keys and their products are shared to the involved entities to secure all the
communication pipelines and tunnels. Key-binding approaches allow only the
storage of information coming from the combination of biometric data with
randomly generated keys. In this case, the keys are non-biometric elements,
such as a PIN, password or credential with certiﬁed container of attributes.
Both schemes are fuzzy, since the demanded samples are slightly diﬀerent each
time, unlike the encryption keys in the traditional cryptography [151]. Crypto-
biometrics are currently a popular technique, being one of the most suitable
ﬁelds for applications that demand large-scale DBs for the storage of biometric
information and high robustness against multiple attacks, such as government or
banking services [122]. It is a privacy-aware cryptographic method that respects
the privacy recommendation of unlinkability. It can be used in access control
mechanisms with high complexity [177]. However, this can aﬀect the ﬂexibility
of the technique. Recent works report that its applicability is ineﬀective for
anonymous DB models [6].
