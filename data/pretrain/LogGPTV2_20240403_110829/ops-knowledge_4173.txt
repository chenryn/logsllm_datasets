User: I'm writing a python application that has a glade gui. Using subprocess to execute some shell commands in the background.
Using a glade GUI which has a scrolledwindow widget and a textview widget inside the scrolledwindow widget. The textview gets populated as the subprocess.Popen object run and display their stdout and stderr to this textview.
My problem is that the textview is constantly populated, but stays still @ scroll position 0, 0 (top-most, left-most)
I want this scrolledwindow widget to stays at bottom-most, left-most at all times... 
Does anyone have any idea which method I need to call scroll this thing downwards?
Assistant: look at gtk.ScrolledWindow.set_placement.
(never tried)
