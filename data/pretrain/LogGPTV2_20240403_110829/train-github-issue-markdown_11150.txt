Hi,
  * I use glide to load gif, it can be loaded and displayed in ImageView, but the display is not normal.
  * I use another open source project(GifDrawable) that also support gif, the gif can be loaded and displayed normally in ImageView.
  * Use glide and gifdrawable to load gif effect is as follows.
Use glide | Use gifdrawable
