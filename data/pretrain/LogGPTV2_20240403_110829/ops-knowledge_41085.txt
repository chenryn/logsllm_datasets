Question: "An Android device manufacturer is facing an issue where certain vendor scripts are failing during the boot process. The scripts are intended to write to system files that are not part of the stable system-vendor ABI. Which of the following actions should the manufacturer take to comply with the vendor init process and resolve the script failures?"
 "A": "Grant the scripts additional permissions in the system `vendor_init.te` file."
 "B": "Reimplement the commands in the scripts through stable interfaces according to the Treble guidelines."
 "C": "Mark the scripts with the `data_between_core_and_vendor_violators` attribute in the system `vendor_init.te` to bypass the restrictions."
 "D": "Remove the scripts from the `/vendor` partition to avoid the SELinux context `u:r:vendor_init:s0` restrictions."
Answer: B
