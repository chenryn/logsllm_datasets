### Chip & PIN is Definitely Broken - v1.3

#### Threats
- **Data Stealing**: We discussed the use of EMV skimming for magstripe cloning and online usage.
- **Card Stealing**: Research from Cambridge University shows that stolen cards can be used without a PIN, though it is hoped that this vulnerability will be addressed.
- **PIN Harvesting**: Does the current state-of-the-art EMV implementation truly protect against PIN harvesting and the subsequent use of stolen cards?

#### Cardholder Verification
- The card communicates its preferred cardholder verification method (CVM) to the terminal via the CVM List (tag 8E).

#### Cardholder Verification Method (CVM) Condition Codes
| Bits | Meaning | Value |
|------|---------|-------|
| 0    | Reserved for Future Use (RFU) | N/A |
| 0    | Fail cardholder verification if this CVM is unsuccessful | N/A |
| 1    | Apply succeeding CV rule if this CVM is unsuccessful | N/A |
| 000000 | Fail CVM processing | 00 or 40 |
| 000001 | Plaintext PIN verification performed by ICC | 01 or 41 |
| 000010 | Enciphered PIN verified online | 02 or 42 |
| 000011 | Plaintext PIN verification by ICC and signature (paper) | 03 or 43 |
| 000100 | Enciphered PIN verification by ICC | 04 or 44 |
| 000101 | Enciphered PIN verification by ICC and signature (paper) | 05 or 45 |
| 000110-011101 | Values reserved for future use | 06-1D/16-5D |
| 011110 | Signature (paper) | 1E or 5E |
| 011111 | No CVM required | 1F or 5F |
| 100000-101111 | Values reserved for future use | 20-2F/60-6F |
| 110000-111110 | Values reserved for future use | 30-3E/70-7E |
| 111111 | Not available | 3F or 7F |

#### CVM List
- The CVM List is now signed on all cards, making it tamper-proof.
- If the preferred authentication method is "Signature (paper)", "Enciphered PIN verified online", or "Enciphered PIN verification by ICC", the PIN is not sent by the terminal to the card.
- It is believed that only when "Plaintext PIN verification performed by ICC" is present and selected from the CVM List can the PIN be harvested by an EMV skimmer.

#### Action Codes
- In a scenario with DDA-only cards and a "secure" CVM List, can we still harvest the PIN?
- Issuer Action Codes (card) and Terminal Action Codes (terminal) specify policies for accepting or rejecting transactions using TVR specifications.
- These codes are OR'ed, and there are three types: Denial, Online, and Default. Online Action Codes specify which failure conditions trigger online transactions.

#### Action Codes Example
- `9f0e` Issuer Action Code - Denial (5 bytes): `00 00 00 00 00`
- `9f0f` Issuer Action Code - Online (5 bytes): `f0 78 fc f8 00`
- `9f0d` Issuer Action Code â€“ Default (5 bytes): `f0 78 fc a0 00`
- Translation: "Do not deny a transaction without attempting to go online. If offline SDA fails, transmit the transaction online."
- In all tested terminals and cards, we were able to manipulate the action codes (when necessary) so that tampering with the CVM List would not result in offline rejection.

#### CVM List Downgrade
- The modified CVM List is honored by the terminal, allowing "Plaintext PIN verification performed by ICC" to be presented, enabling PIN harvesting for SDA/DDA cards.

#### Backend Detection
- The attack execution might be detected by the backend via the TVR, CVM Results, and CVR, which advertise failed data authentication and cleartext CVM. However, blocking a card solely based on this information is not a realistic solution.
- A downgraded CVM List with offline PIN + fallback to online PIN might be used to "hide" cleartext CVM Results and CVR by answering incorrect PIN offline verification to the terminal (without passing the command to the card). The customer would be prompted twice for the PIN.

#### Untested Scenarios
- It might be possible for the skimmer to advertise relevant offline authentication records from a stored valid SDA card with a convenient CVM List for the authentication phase, and use the real card for the transaction, resulting in "clean" TVR, CVM Results, and CVR.
- Terminal Capabilities (9f33), when requested by the card via CDOL1/CDOL2 and sent by the terminal via GENERATE AC, can be intercepted and rewritten to advertise only SDA capability in case of DDA card skimming.
- CDA is designed to protect against this, but it should still be possible for the skimmer to force usage as an SDA card.

#### Summary
- An EMV skimmer poses a serious threat due to ease of installation and difficult detection.
- EMV data allows fraudulent usage on websites that perform insufficient validation (as well as magstripe clone for cards that do not use iCVV).
- The PIN can always be intercepted, regardless of card type (SDA or DDA) and CVM / Issuer Action Codes configuration.
- Stealing an EMV chip & PIN card that was previously skimmed enables full usage and raises serious liability considerations.

#### Vendor Response
- EMVCo announced that the vulnerability will not be fixed, stating that "suitable countermeasures are available when the full payment process is taken into account."
- MasterCard spokesman Jan Lundequist (head of chip product management) said in an interview that the EMV system is too complex for an easy fix.
- In the Netherlands, the vulnerability has reportedly been closed by updating POS firmware with a version that disables plaintext PIN verification for domestic cards (believed to be 100% DDA).

#### Recommendations
- Despite industry claims about reduced fraud levels, EMV is inadequate and overly complex. It should be replaced with a simpler and cleaner solution.
- Correctly implemented cryptography should be performed between the card and the backend (online) or the card and the terminal (offline) for double authentication and preventing interception/man-in-the-middle attacks for every single step of the transaction.
- Terminals cannot be trusted; PIN input and verification should be confined to the card itself (e.g., e-ink scrambled touchpad).

#### Additional Recommendations
- "Patching" EMV is possible by disabling plaintext PIN verification on POS and ATM firmwares, preventing the downgrade attack.
- This would work with every card type, as online PIN verification can be used for SDA.
- Online PIN verification could be used all the time, as both North American and European banks have little use for the entire offline verification process pushed by EMV and could handle everything online.

#### Additional Information
- Chip skimmer installations dated 2008 have been reported by law enforcement authorities after this presentation was made available.
