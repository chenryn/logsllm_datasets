### Describe your issue.
Installing scipy==1.8.0 fails on MacOS M1 with python3.9, because the build
requires numpy 1.20.0 that doesn't build on M1
(https://github.com/scipy/scipy/blob/v1.8.0/pyproject.toml#L30)
Can someone please update this is make it really a minimum requirement to use
1.20.0 and not a hard requirement? So have `numpy >= 1.20.0` and not `numpy ==
1.20.0`. Even better would be 1.20.3, which does install on M1. At the moment,
no matter if I pre-install the latest version of numpy, the install for scipy
fails, because it is trying to get numpy==1.20.0 to be installed.
