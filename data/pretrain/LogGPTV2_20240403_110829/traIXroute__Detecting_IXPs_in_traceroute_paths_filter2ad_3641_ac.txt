with traIXroute to detect IXPs. We repeat our experiments with data from
the three teams to check for the consistency of our results across diﬀerent vantage
points. In addition, we process the collected paths to remove probes without any
reply or with loops. The number of probes after pre-processing dropped from to
31.8 million to 27.8 million probes.
In Table 5 we ﬁrst report the fraction of traceroute paths which go through
an IXP. The monitors are located in a mix of academic and corporate insti-
tutions [2]. We ﬁrst observe that the fraction of paths that cross an IXP is
17.44 %, 17.65 % and 23.64 % in the three teams. We observe a slightly larger
fraction in the 3rd team, because one of the monitors in this team is located
in an IXP (AMS-IX). Despite this, our results are mostly consistent across the
three teams: Approximately one out of ﬁve paths in our datasets go through an
IXP. Furthermore, in paths that go through an IXP we observe 1 to 1.05 IXPs
per path. This is interesting because it conﬁrms the expectation based on the
valley-free model [17] that up to one peering link, and therefore one IXP1, is
crossed in an end-to-end path. Even if BGP allows much more complex policies
and the Internet IXP ecosystem evolves continuously, Internet paths in our mea-
surements largely conform to the well-known valley-free model. Furthermore, we
observe that paths cross on average between 14.06 to 14.77 hops, and the IXP
hop is located near the middle, i.e., on average between hop 5.4 and 6.68 for
the diﬀerent teams. For completeness, we also compute the number of ASes the
paths cross, which ranges between 4.17 and 4.48 ASes.
Top IXPs in Terms of Paths. We next analyze which IXPs attract most
paths and how the number of paths an IXP attracts compares with the number
of their member ASes. In Table 6 we show the top-10 IXPs in terms of paths,
1 IXPs links are typically used for settlement-free peering relationships.

the min and max numbers of paths over the three teams, and number of their
members. We ﬁrst observe that the top-3 IXPs, namely AMS-IX, LINX, and
DE-CIX, are the same both in terms of paths and members. These IXPs are
located in Europe; 5 of the following IXPs are located in the US and 4 of these
are run by Equinix, i.e., the largest IXP corporation in the US. Finally, one IXP
in South America and one more European close the top-10. We note that in
Table 6 the 570 K paths that cross the AMS-IX, is an outlier due to a single ark
monitor located in AMS-IX. Despite this, the ranking does not change if we only
consider the other teams of monitors.
traIXroute: Detecting IXPs in traceroute paths
357
Besides, below the top-3 IXPs we observe signiﬁcant variance between the
number of IXP members and the number of IXP paths. Figure 3 illustrates how
the number of IXP members correlates with the number of paths. The overall
correlation coeﬃcient is 0.8. We observe that the top-3 IXPs are close to the 95-
percentile conﬁdence intervals, which means that compared to the average they
have more members than paths. In contrast, many US IXPs have more paths
than their number of members indicates. Notably, Equinix Palo Alto is in the
4th position with a small diﬀerence in terms of paths from DE-CIX, although
the latter has 520 members and the former only 116.
6 Conclusions
Internet users, network operators, and researchers would beneﬁt if they were
able to know from which IXPs packets go through. To help towards this goal, in
this paper we introduce a tool that extends the commonly used traceroute
with techniques to detect IXPs. Our techniques rely on data about the exact IP
addresses of BGP router interfaces connected to the IXP subnet, i.e., triplets
{IP address −→ IXP, AS}, extracted from the PeeringDB and the Packet
Clearing House. This data has not been previously explored for identifying
IXPs. We show that they are both rich, i.e., we ﬁnd 12,716 triplets for 460 IXPs,
and accurate, i.e., our validation shows 92–93 % accuracy. We also incorporate in
our heuristics an IXP membership check for the adjacent ASes to have stronger
evidence that an IXP was crossed. To demonstrate the utility of traIXroute,
we use it to show that approximately one out of ﬁve paths cross an IXP in our
data. In addition, in most cases, we observe not more than one IXP per path,
which is located near the middle. Furthermore, we observe that although the
top IXPs both in terms of paths and members are located in Europe, US IXPs
attract many more paths than their number of members indicates. In the future,
we plan to investigate how traIXroute could help Internet users to have more
control over their paths.
