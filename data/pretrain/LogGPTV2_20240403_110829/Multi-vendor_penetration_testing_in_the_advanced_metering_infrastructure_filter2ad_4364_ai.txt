develop feeder models to support the designing, upgrading, and operating of 
distribution systems with high penetrations of rooftop photovoltaics and energy 
storage systems. 
Many of the utilities are exploring ways to make better use of AMI deployments through improved 
integration with other corporate functions and information and management systems. For example, 
some of the utility AMI business cases did not anticipate the full extent of benefits of using AMI data for 
outage management and power restoration efforts. These utilities now plan to upgrade OMS to fully 
integrate AMI systems and smart meter data.  
73 
Almost half of the projects implemented AMI in small-scale (<20 percent of customers; 11 projects) or 
partial-scale (20-90 percent of customers; 20 projects) deployments. Many of these utilities now plan 
to expand smart meter deployments to more customers and services. For example, PECO, a large IOU 
in Pennsylvania, used DOE funds to deploy smart meters to about half of its customers, and plans to 
deploy smart meters system-wide. Similarly, Westar Energy in Kansas currently plans to deploy an 
additional 200,000 smart meters over the next five years, building on the initial deployment under SGIG 
of almost 50,000 smart meters. 
Advanced communications networks deployed under SGIG constitute the backbone of not only a 
smart grid, but also future smart cities. Three municipal utilities—which each offer both electricity and 
water services—adopted long-term, comprehensive smart grid strategies that included building 
communications networks with large capacities to handle future smart grid applications, and with high 
bandwidth to accommodate other city services in addition to electricity. Smart grid communications 
networks can be leveraged to provide additional customer services such as internet access, high-speed 
data access, and corporate intranets for companies with geographically dispersed facilities. 
Several municipal utilities provide gas and water services in addition to electricity, and plan to expand 
AMI to cover these other services while leveraging the communications network and MDMS built under 
SGIG. For example, GWP and BWP deployed smart water meters (outside the SGIG project) leveraging 
the AMI communications network.  
5.2  AMI and Customer System Projects Highlighted Continuing R&D 
Challenges 
Advances in data analytics could help utilities extract additional benefits from the large volume of 
interval load data produced by AMI. Utilities require better data processing and management solutions, 
advanced software platforms, and improved models for assessing system conditions and predicting 
demand impacts and energy savings levels.  
Consistent data formats and more comprehensive interoperability standards are needed to achieve 
optimal levels of interoperability for smart meters, customer devices, and communications and 
information systems. Several utilities indicated a desire to see these issues resolved and observe 
sustained system performance at desired levels before considering further investments in AMI and 
customer systems. DOE supports continuing efforts in these areas, including the Green Button Initiative, 
which provides a standard format for energy usage data now used by utilities and vendors serving more 
than 60 million businesses and households. The Smart Grid Interoperability Panel, along with other 
efforts, has also had success in developing tools and techniques for customer data and interoperability.  
AMI deployments raise new questions about the security of customer data, the types of entities that 
can access it, and how the data will be protected from cybersecurity breaches and other data privacy 
intrusions. DOE supports implementation of appropriate data privacy protections and participated in a 
collaborative process through the Voluntary Code of Conduct, which developed general principles for 
ensuring customer energy usage data privacy for utilities and third parties. Cybersecurity and 
interoperability remain important technical challenges for modernizing electric distribution systems. 
Standards, protocols, tools, and techniques are needed for ensuring secure and interoperable 
74

technologies and systems. Success in these areas involves ongoing activities for government and 
industry, including changes in regulations, business practices, and consumer data privacy protections. 
There are many opportunities to make smart appliances and building energy management equipment 
on the customer’s side of the meter more “grid-friendly.” Proper characterization, improved 
interoperability, and new controls are required to enable the optimal coordination of electrical 
resources housed within buildings and industrial plants. Residential and commercial buildings, and 
industrial facilities, consist of many physical assets that can be regarded as an energy ecosystem. From 
power sources (DER), to loads (appliances and machines), to storage (batteries and thermal energy) and 
controls (building energy management systems), buildings and industrial plants can have all the 
components that form an integrated electric power system.  
However, communication and control capabilities are limited among these various assets, and 
interoperability standards are yet to be developed. This results in numerous proprietary control and 
communication standards developed by independent manufacturers. Automated and grid-responsive 
equipment can be designed to detect voltage and frequency fluctuations or respond to signals from 
control systems. However, challenges remain with ensuring that these devices will be capable of 
providing grid services without jeopardizing the quality and reliability of their primary functions of 
serving building and occupant needs.  
Continued innovations in applications and tools that operate on mobile devices (e.g., mobile phones, 
tablets, and laptop computers) can help customers by putting data on consumption and costs into 
their hands when they need it and in forms they can readily use. DOE is supporting innovations in 
devices and software for enhancing consumer engagement in DSM programs. Industry research by the 
Smart Grid Consumer Collaborative and other organizations find that the average consumer knows little 
about how electricity is generated, distributed, and consumed, the impact of using it, or how to 
maximize efficiency and cost savings. DOE participates in Power over Energy, which helps industry 
participants to engage and encourage consumers to become more active and informed participants in 
energy technologies, markets, and discussions about regulatory policies. 
DOE expects to continue being an important contributor to grid modernization through research, 
development, demonstration, analysis, and technology transfer activities, especially in areas where 
there is a demonstrated federal role such as cybersecurity, interoperability, and advanced concepts and 
technologies based on new discoveries in science, engineering, and mathematics.  
While the SGIG program is now complete, grid modernization remains an important national priority. 
DOE through the Grid Modernization Initiative (GMI) recently released a Grid Modernization Multi-Year 
Program Plan (MYPP) that describes the challenges and opportunities for achieving a modern, secure, 
sustainable, and reliable grid and how DOE will help achieve this through programs and activities. The 
Grid Modernization Lab Consortium, a multi-year collaboration among 14 DOE National Laboratories 
and regional networks, will assist DOE in developing and implementing the activities in the MYPP. 23

AMI and Customer Systems: Results from the SGIG Program 
Approach to Analysis and Data Collection 
The 70 Smart Grid Investment Grant (SGIG) advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) and customer 
system projects collected and analyzed data about the deployed technologies and systems, grid impacts, 
benefits, and lessons learned.  
The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) compiled this information for 
analysis of AMI and customer system operations, and for sharing 
with the electric power industry through DOE’s Smart Grid 
Investment Grant (SGIG) website.  
The primary purpose of SGIG’s data collection and analysis activities is to provide electric power industry 
decision makers, public and private, with information to help assess the cost-effectiveness of 
investments in AMI and customer systems. The goal is to help accelerate modernization of the nation’s 
electric distribution systems. 
B.1.  Analysis Approach 
Figure B-1 shows the overall DOE approach for analysis of SGIG AMI and customer system projects.24 
The analysis begins with assessments of the deployed smart grid assets. These assessments include the 
technologies and systems, such as smart meters and in-home displays, and how they can be installed 
and operated by the SGIG utilities, vendors, services providers, and participating customers. The next 
step involves assessments of the new smart grid functions that the new assets enable. This includes 
assessments of the new functions and capabilities, such as remote connections/disconnections and 
demand management, and how to make them operational to achieve certain grid, customer, and 
societal impacts and benefits. 
Figure B-1. SGIG Analysis Approach 
The third step involves assessments of the smart grid impacts, which generally includes analysis of 
specific physical metrics that measure changes resulting from deployment of assets and implementation 
of functions to achieve improvements in operational efficiencies or reductions in peak demands. The last 
step involves the determination of smart grid benefits, which generally includes monetization of the 
impacts for use in business case analysis, such as cost savings or deferral of capital investments.  
24 See DOE, “Analytical Approach” on SmartGrid.gov; Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), Guidebook for Cost/Benefit 
Analysis of Smart Grid Demonstration Projects, Revision 1, (DOE, December 2012); and DOE and EPRI, Methodological Approach 
for Estimating the Benefits and Costs of Smart Grid Demonstration Projects, December 2009.  
79 
Benefits analysis can include utility, customer, and societal perspectives and covers two general types of 
benefits: those that can be monetized, such as cost savings, and those that are difficult to monetize, 
such as reductions in environmental emissions or increases in customer choices, services, and 
satisfaction.  
B.2.  Data Collection Approach 
To conduct effective analysis of the SGIG AMI and customer system projects, accurate data is needed 
from the utilities on the performance of the deployed assets, functions, impacts, and benefits. At the 
outset of the SGIG program in 2009-2010, DOE collaborated with each of the utility project teams to 
develop Metrics and Benefits Reporting Plans (MBRP). Each SGIG project was required to have an 
approved MBRP before equipment installations could begin. The MBRPs were customized to reflect 
each project’s unique scope and objectives.  
The plans were developed through a series of meetings between DOE and the project teams and 
outlined the specific data to be collected and when and how it would be reported to DOE. Each plan 
discussed two separate sets of data collection efforts: Build Metrics and Impact Metrics.25 
•  Build Metrics comprise the set of devices and systems that the projects purchased and installed; 
for the duration of the program, this information was posted and updated on the SGIG website 
every six months to inform stakeholders of SGIG projects’ progress. AMI and customer systems 
build metric data includes information on the numbers and costs of installed devices and 
systems. 
Impact Metrics comprise the set of information developed by the SGIG projects to assess the 
effects of the new technologies and systems on grid and customer operations and business 
practices. Impact Metrics submissions to DOE occurred twice a year and required the projects to 
collect and analyze information to show how the installed technologies and systems operated to 
achieve grid modernization objectives in several key areas: billing and metering services, 
demand management, revenue collections, voltage controls, and outage management.  
• 
The Impact Metric data submissions typically involved the utilities calculating quantitative values that 
showed the effects before and after, or without and with, deployment and operation of AMI and 
customer systems. One of the challenges in estimating AMI and customer system impacts involves the 
need to develop accurate baselines (e.g., before AMI or without AMI) against which impacts can be 
measured.  
B.3.  Scope of Data Collection  
Table B-1 lists the build metrics that were collected for the SGIG AMI and customer system projects. 
Because each of the projects had its own unique scope and objectives, not all of the SGIG AMI and 
customer system projects provided information on all of the build metrics in Table B-1. 
25 DOE’s SGIG website contains addition information on the approach to build and impact metrics.

Because each of the projects had its own unique scope and objectives, not all of the projects provided 
information on all of the impact metrics in Table B-2. In addition, the methods used by the projects to 
estimate impact metrics varied so it was necessary for DOE to categorize and analyze the data for 
presenting appropriate comparisons and information summaries.

B.4.  Challenges and Limitations 
DOE’s data collection and analysis activities have produced a variety of reports and case studies on 
results and lessons learned from the SGIG AMI and customer systems projects.26 The extent of the 
analysis is limited in various ways due to challenges that the SGIG AMI and customer systems projects 
faced during the data collection and analysis process. 
One of the most significant challenges concerned the development of accurate baselines for assessing 
grid impacts. Most of the SGIG utilities encountered challenges in collecting and analyzing appropriate 
data for the development of accurate baselines. Many underestimated the amount of time, effort, 
engineering, and statistical expertise needed for accurate impact metric estimation and reporting.  
For example, some projects used control groups to assess before-and-after impacts from time-based 
rate and other demand response programs. This technique was complicated in many cases by the need 
to make randomized assignments of participating customers to treatment and control groups so that 
the causes of impacts on key metrics such as demand reductions could be determined to be the result of 
project activities versus other, potentially confounding factors such as differences in customer 
demographics. Some projects were successful in accomplishing randomized assignments for treatment 
and control groups and DOE’s analysis focused on the experiences and reported results from these.27 
Another challenge with AMI and customer system data collection and analysis concerned the lack of 
commonality among the projects in their respective goals and objectives. While many of the project’s 
smart meters deployments covered more than 90 percent of their systems, some conducted pilot-scale 
deployments on less than 20 percent of their systems. And, for customer systems, some devices (e.g., 
direct load control [DLC] devices and PCTs) were deployed widely, while others (e.g., IHDs and smart 
appliances) were deployed in relatively small numbers for testing and evaluations. Because of these 
differences, it is not productive to aggregate and analyze data for projects with such starkly different 
sets of objectives.  
A final challenge concerned differences in the level of experience and expertise among the SGIG utilities 
with AMI and customer systems. In many cases, the technologies and systems involved learning curves 
to determine how to optimize new functions and capabilities properly. Projects that were primarily 
interested in learning generated fewer grid and customer impacts.  
26 See Appendix A for a list of documents and web links. 
27 A subset of 10 SGIG utilities conducted Consumer Behavior Studies (CBS) that applied experimental designs and randomized 
samples to evaluate customer enrollments, retention, and response to time-based rates. DOE’s SGIG-CBS website contains 
further information on these projects including project descriptions and analysis reports.
