The form validators are nicely integrated with the translator. The only thing
you have to do is set your language and the messages are automatically
translated.
With the authentication system, this is not the case. A possible, simple,
solution would be to add authMsg.xx.xliff files to
Symfony/Bundle/FrameworkBundle/Resources/translations/ that contain
translations for AuthenticationExceptions. Then you could translate the error
like this:  
`  
{% if error %}  
`
`{{ error.message|trans({}, 'authMsg') }}`
`  
{% endif %}  
`
This is how you should display the error according to the handbook
http://symfony.com/doc/current/book/security.html
Here is an example authMsg.nl.xliff http://.../authMsg.nl.xliff
