the ﬁrst and last letter of the word/phrase that best describes
the inkblot. The letter pairs form the password. The inkblots
are displayed, in order, as cues during login and users enter
each of their 2-character responses. It was suggested [84] that
with time, users would memorize their password and would no
longer need to rely on the inkblots as cues. Twenty-ﬁve users
in a lab study were presented with 10 inkblots and created a
corresponding password. After one day, 80% of users entered
their entire password correctly; 72% were successful after one
week. With only one exception, when users made mistakes,
it was on only one of their 10 character-pairs. The resulting
passwords were relatively strong (20 characters long with no
recognizable words; although some letters were more popular
than others). It is claimed [84] that inkblots should be abstract
enough that an attacker seeing the inkblots would not have an
advantage in guessing a user’s password.
Similarly, Jiminy [85], [86] is a graphical tool for remember-
ing text passwords. A grid of alphanumeric characters is placed
over an image and users are provided with coloured templates
that contain several openings. To log in, users must select the
appropriate template, “anchor” it to the correct location on the
image, then enter the sequence of characters visible through
the openings. Instead of remembering their text password,
users remember the position of the template on the image.
Several users in paper-based and web-based studies selected
the same anchor points, indicating that the security impact of
hotspots in this scheme is an open question.
Alsulaiman and El Saddik [87] proposed a 3D scheme
where users navigate a 3D world and perform actions in-
terpreted as their password. Much like the 2D graphical
passwords above, the 3D environment acts as a cue to prompt
users to perform their actions. The designers envision that
users could perform various actions such as clicking on certain
areas, typing or drawing on a virtual surface, supplying a
biometric, or interacting with parts of the virtual world (like
turning on a light switch). A prototype system [87] implements
a small portion of the scheme (users can walk through a virtual
art gallery and enter text passwords at virtual computers or
select pictures as part of a graphical password). Detail about
other proposed components is conceptual only. No user testing
or security results are reported, making usability or security
evaluations difﬁcult.

presented in sequence, one at a time; this provides one-to-
one cueing. Each image after the ﬁrst
is chosen using a
deterministic function of the current image, the co-ordinates
of the user-entered click-point, and a user identiﬁer. Users
receive immediate feedback if they enter an incorrect click-
point during login, seeing an image that they do not recognize.
At this point they can restart password entry to correct the
error. This implicit feedback [82] is not helpful to an attacker
who does not know the expected sequence of images.
In a lab-based user study [82], users successfully logged in
on the ﬁrst attempt, without errors or restarts, in 96% of trials.
On average, participants took 25 seconds to create a password,
and 7 seconds to login. Analysis of user choice in click-points
revealed that users tended to select click-points falling within
known hotspots [83]. Further analysis [39] showed that simple
patterns of click-points were eliminated (cf. PassPoints above).
Persuasive Cued Click-Points (PCCP) [83] is a variation
of CCP designed to persuade users to select more random
passwords. It functions like CCP, but during password creation
the image is dimmed except for a small square viewport area
randomly positioned on the image. Users select a click-point
from within this viewport (see Figure 8), or may press a
“shufﬂe” button to randomly reposition the viewport until a
suitable location is found. On subsequent logins, images are
displayed in their normal format with no dimming or viewport.
Common wisdom that users choose the path-of-least-resistance
here means selecting a click-point within the ﬁrst or ﬁrst
few viewports. The design intent of the randomized viewport
positions is to ﬂatten the distribution of click-points across
multiple users, to reduce the effects of hotspots.
A lab-based user study [83] found that click-points selected
by PCCP participants did not fall into known hotspots, new
hotspots were not formed, and PCCP passwords did not form
simple patterns of click-points [39]. Login success rates were
similar to the original CCP system. On average, participants
took 50 seconds to create a password (an increase caused

different methods and may represent completely different
measures. In what follows, we provide context and offer
speciﬁc recommendations intended to facilitate comparisons
of such schemes in the future. Some of the observations
are common knowledge to human-computer interaction (HCI)
experts, but are either not widely known, or widely practised,
in the graphical password literature to date.
Design decisions related to usability should be evaluated
jointly with an exploration of their impact on security, since a
usable authentication system without adequate security fails to
meet its primary purpose. For example, a system where users
can choose memorable-but-weak passwords may be usable but
may result in a false sense of security. Interface design changes
that appear to affect only usability may in fact
introduce
additional security vulnerabilities.
The remainder of this discussion is organized under the
headings: target users, tasks, domains.
A. Target Users
As with other systems, characteristics of the intended users
must be taken into account when designing or selecting an
appropriate graphical password scheme. The expertise level
of target users may dictate the acceptable complexity of the
interaction, and the level of training required or expected.
The frequency of use may also have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence
on usability. Frequently accessed systems should be quick
to use, and may rely more heavily on users’ memory, as
frequent repetition aids memory. If passwords are used for
infrequently accessed systems, they must be especially mem-
orable since memory decays over time. There are also issues
of accessibility that arise with graphical passwords since
different user populations, such as the elderly [89], may have
different requirements. Many of the systems we have discussed
implicitly require users with good vision, potentially including
good colour vision (for recognizing cues), and good motor
skills (for entering sketches or accurate clicks on an image).
Design of graphical password systems therefore needs to either
address these issues, provide alternatives, or be very aware of
the limitations they impose on who will be able to successfully
use the software. Because authentication systems by their
nature act as gate-keepers to computer systems and services,
these issues must be taken very seriously.
B. Tasks
Ease of login is the most frequently examined task, but
is only one of many. Ideally, usability should be explored
along several dimensions. For usability, essential elements to
measure and report include: time to create a password, and
time to login; memorability (typically through success rates
and number of errors made during login over an extended
period); and interference, by testing with a normal password
load (as opposed to with only one password at a time).
1) Password Initialization: Authentication systems require
initialization. A graphical password can either be assigned,
or selected by the user. Training may be conducted, per-
haps at least to compensate for the novelty of the scheme
in comparison with more well-known approaches such as
Fig. 9.
Inkblots used in the Inkblot Authentication user study [84]
While some analysis of the above schemes can be done us-
ing standard statistical tests, occasionally novel or specialized
approaches are required. For example, in click-based graphical
passwords, analysis of the two-dimensional space is desirable
to identify patterns in user behaviour. Conventional statistics
do not apply, but point pattern analysis [88] from spatial
statistics has been used [83] to evaluate and compare clustering
of click-points on images.
With click-based graphical passwords, as well as other types
of authentication schemes, getting an accurate measure of the
effective password space remains a challenge when user choice
is involved. One alternative approach is to evaluate whether
the set of passwords (or password components) selected by
users is representative of the full theoretical password space
T . A Monte Carlo approach can determine the likelihood that
a particular set of passwords occurred by chance (and thus is
similar to a random set taken from T ). With Monte Carlo
methods, randomly generated datasets are used to identify
the range of probable analytical measures which can then be
compared to those based on datasets collected from actual
usage. This approach has been used to compare models of the
effective password spaces for PassPoints, CCP, and PCCP [39].
In summary, early cued-recall schemes, such as PassPoints,
offered promise as alternatives to text passwords due to their
large theoretical password space and short login times. How-
ever, analysis revealed reduced security due to the existence
of hotspots and geometric patterns in user selection of click-
points. Later schemes, such as PCCP, aim to explicitly address
these issues without resorting to system-assigned passwords,
and have introduced other features such as implicit feedback,
and graphical aids for text passwords that might beneﬁt other
next generation authentication schemes as well.
VII. USABILITY ASPECTS
This section is based on an examination of the literature
reporting results of usability testing of graphical password
systems. As there has been essentially no coordinated work to
date towards an accepted standard for evaluating the usability
of graphical password schemes, nearly every system evaluated
(if at all), has been tested using different criteria. This makes
comparison difﬁcult at best. Even when apparently similar
measures are reported, they have often been calculated using
TR-09-09: GRAPHICAL PASSWORDS

text passwords. Password conﬁrmation is usually involved to
ensure that users have not made trivial entry errors, and can
accurately remember and enter their password after a short
time before testing longer term memorability.
Allowing users to select their own password can aid us-
ability since a chosen password having personal meaning
may be easier to remember. However, this design decision
has security disadvantages. As discussed later under security,
graphical password systems that suffer from predictability
problems related to user choice include the canonical examples
of all three main categories: PassFaces, DAS (Pass-Go), and
PassPoints. For example, from their study of Faces and Story,
Davis et al. [51] conclude that allowing user choice leads to
predictable patterns that can be exploited by attackers.
Allowing user-chosen passwords can also encourage pass-
word reuse across accounts. Despite obvious usability advan-
tages (e.g., reduced memory load, and no need to think of
new creative passwords for each new account), password reuse
implies that an attacker who gains access to an account on a
weakly protected system may then have sufﬁcient information
to log in to that user’s higher value accounts. If permitted,
users often reuse passwords verbatim; Florencio et al. [90]
found that text passwords are reused on an average of 6 differ-
ent accounts. Many users also form some common strategy or
pattern across accounts [91]. Both situations may be exploited
by an attacker who acquires one of the passwords.
Systems which assign randomly selected passwords re-
move predictability, and also eliminate the potential for cross-
account password reuse. However, such systems may require
a time-consuming training process to help users remember
their passwords (e.g., recall Weinshall’s scheme [57]). Even
with training, such passwords may remain more difﬁcult to
remember since opportunities for leveraging are removed. In
the PassFaces study of Everitt et al. [55], which assigned
passwords to avoid the predictability seen in earlier PassFaces
studies, the order of password acquisition and login frequency
signiﬁcantly impacted password memorability.
It is possible for a system to allow partial user choice in
password selection. For example, in PCCP (see Section VI-B),
the middle-ground between allowing user choice and system-
assigned passwords led to passwords nearly indistinguishable
from random on the measures examined [39]. Further work is
needed to evaluate the effect on long-term memorability.
2) Login: Login should be quick and simple since it is the
most common task completed by users of an authentication
system. Deviation from this rule may be acceptable under
certain circumstances (see section VII-C below).
Text passwords have an advantage of being ubiquitous,
and can be typed in a few seconds. It is thus natural to
compare the time to enter a graphical password to that for
a text password. Recognition-based schemes typically have
the slowest password entry times, as users iterate through
several rounds of images. On the other hand, some cued-recall
schemes have been shown to have login times nearly as fast
as text passwords [28].
Error and success rates on login are the usability measures
most often reported in user studies of graphical passwords.
Unfortunately, they are often calculated in different ways and
measured at different points in time. For example, some studies
consider the trial a success if users can log in within three
attempts, while others count only trials that are successful with
no errors. For the purpose of comparison, we recommend that,
at minimum, success rates be reported for the ﬁrst attempt and
after three attempts (due to the common practice of lockout
after three failed attempts).
Memorability issues are important when discussing login
performance since memorability is a main factor determining
whether login will be successful. Measures of memorability
address whether passwords can be remembered over short-
and long-term and with varying login frequencies. Strategies
for testing memorability are discussed in Section IX-A.
Interference issues are also important. Most graphical pass-
word studies to date have required users to remember only one
password at a time, whereas in real-life users must remember
many passwords and may get them confused. In the cognitive
psychology literature [92], memory interference is “the im-
paired ability to remember an item when it is similar to other
items stored in memory”. With authentication, interference
occurs when remembering a password for one system impairs
the user’s memory of a password for another system. This may
be of particular concern with graphical passwords since expo-
sure to similar images from multiple concurrent passwords or
from password resets may aggravate the problem. Although
an important usability concern, published studies [28], [55],
[59] evaluating interference from multiple passwords are only
now beginning to appear.
3) Password reset and password change: The tasks of
resetting or changing passwords are not typically examined
during usability testing of new graphical password schemes,
but these are often required in practice when users forget
passwords. The process may involve the user interacting only
with the system, or may require contact with help desk
personnel. Both involve conﬁrming the user’s identity through
some secondary means, and issuing a new password (which
often must be changed immediately on the next login). New
text passwords can easily be communicated by phone or
through email; graphical passwords cannot be communicated
as easily. While this provides protection against some social
engineering attacks, it also poses a usability challenge. One
solution is to assign temporary non-graphical password during
password reset, giving system access to create a new password.
