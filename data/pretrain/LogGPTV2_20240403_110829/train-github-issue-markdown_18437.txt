**Issue with Service Selector in Kubernetes:**

I am encountering an issue when trying to define a selector for a Kubernetes service that includes multiple values for the `track` label. The following configuration was attempted:

```yaml
spec:
  selector:
    app: foobar-service
    track: prod
    track: post-prod-staging
```

However, this resulted in only the last value being used, as shown by the output of `kubectl describe svc svc-prod-svc`:

```plaintext
Name:                   svc-prod-svc
Namespace:              default
Labels:                 
Selector:               app=foobar-service,track=post-prod-staging
```

It appears that Kubernetes does not support defining multiple values for a single key in the selector using the syntax I provided. 

**Expected Behavior:**

Kubernetes should ideally notify the user of the duplication and fail, or at least print a warning. This would help avoid confusion and ensure that the desired selection logic is correctly implemented.
