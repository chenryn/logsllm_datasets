    spec:
      selector:
        app: foobar-service
        track: prod
        track: post-prod-staging
I can't seem to find how to define _IN_ semantic for svc's selector, I tried
to above and it resulted in only the last one being used:
    > kubectl describe svc svc-prod-svc
    Name:                   svc-prod-svc
    Namespace:              default
    Labels:                 
    Selector:               app=foobar-service,track=post-prod-staging
kubectl should probably notify of duplication and fail, or are least print
warning.
