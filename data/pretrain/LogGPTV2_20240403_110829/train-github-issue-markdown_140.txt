hi.
Thank you for using bebel. I have a question.  
After I used bable, my code changed from
    var obj = {
      // key wrapped '
      'key': "value"
    };
to
    var obj = {
      // ' is rejected
      key: "value"
    };
Almost all transform is ok.  
But to change from `'key'` to `key` is not ok for me.  
I want the result to be `'key' -> 'key'`, so I want to keep `'key'` as it.  
In order to do it, what I should do?
