Hello,

Thank you for using Babel.

I have a question regarding the transformation of my code. After using Babel, my code changed from:

```javascript
var obj = {
  // key wrapped in single quotes
  'key': "value"
};
```

to:

```javascript
var obj = {
  // single quotes removed
  key: "value"
};
```

While most of the transformations are fine, I would like to keep the key in single quotes, i.e., `'key'` should remain as `'key'`.

Could you please advise on how I can configure Babel to achieve this?

Thank you.
