Although I have used Eclipse and installed PyDev before, this is the first time I've encountered a situation where the installation both succeeded and failed. 

The installation process appeared to be successful, as PyDev is listed as an installed component, and there were no issues during the setup. However, when I attempt to use PyDev, it seems as though it is not actually installed. There is no Python perspective, no PyDev views in the view list, no new projects under PyDev, and no PyDev preferences.

One difference in my approach this time was that I extracted the latest version of Eclipse into a folder called `~/eclipse` and created a shortcut to run it from there. Typically, I would install Eclipse using `apt-get`, only to realize it's an older version (missing C++11 support), and then upgrade. In these cases, PyDev usually carries over seamlessly.

I am unsure how PyDev can be listed as installed but still not function properly. Any assistance you can provide would be greatly appreciated.

**Potential Solutions:**

It is possible that the issue is related to the 3.x version of PyDev, which requires Java 7. Here are two potential solutions:

1. **Install Java 7:**
   - Install Java 7.
   - Restart Eclipse.
   - PyDev should now function correctly.

2. **Install the Latest 2.x Version of PyDev:**
   - **Remove the Existing PyDev Installation:**
     1. Open the "About Eclipse" window.
     2. Click on the "Installation Details" button.
     3. Use the controls provided to remove the PyDev plugin.
   - **Install the 2.x Version of PyDev:**
     1. Go to `Eclipse > Help > Install New Software`.
     2. Uncheck the "Show only the latest versions" checkbox at the bottom of the dialog.
     3. Select the PyDev update site from the list.
     4. Choose the latest version in the 2.x branch to install.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue and get PyDev working properly in your Eclipse environment.
