User: Please explain what virtualization technology is, including container virtualization and hardware virtualization, and compare their advantages and disadvantages.
Assistant: Virtualization is a technology used to run multiple virtual machines (VMs) on a single physical server. This allows server resources to be split among multiple VMs, with each VM appearing the same as if they had their own computer. Container virtualization and hardware virtualization are two different types of virtualization technologies. Container virtualization Container virtualization is a process-based virtualization technology. It leverages an existing operating system core and allows multiple userspace applications to run in isolated containers. Each container is managed by the container manager and is treated as an independent process. Container virtualization can effectively reduce the usage of system resources, because on each operating system core, multiple containers can run at the same time, which means it can handle more load and respond to requirements faster. Advantages: - It is more efficient to use system resources in containers because they can share the same operating system core. - Containers are generally faster to start and stop than VMs and take up less disk space. - They have a smaller "footprint", enabling more containers to run on a single host. Disadvantages: - Because all containers share the same operating system core, they cannot support multiple different OS (Operating System). - Because they are just apps - the way to manipulate the kernel of the system, which means they may have some security issues like the risk of breaking the isolation between containers. Hardware virtualization Hardware virtualization is a virtualization technology that enables multiple VDs (Virtual Machines) to run on one physical host. It is equivalent to providing each VMs with a virtualization layer for hardware resources, and each VMs has its own operating system. The virtualization layer controls the allocation of system resources to the appropriate VMs. This results in each VMs appearing to be its own computer and able to run its own applications, drivers, libraries etc. as needed. Advantages: - Each VD can run on its own operating system, making it easy to move applications or configurations between different operating systems. - VDs are highly isolated, and each system runs in an independent container. - VDs can be moved or replicated among multiple physical machines, thus providing higher fault tolerance and usage elasticity. Disadvantages: - Often need to run multiple VDs on the same physical server, which will take up a lot of system resources. - Significant time and complexity of starting VDs and allocating resources to a new VD. - This technique requires an additional software stack, at a performance cost.
