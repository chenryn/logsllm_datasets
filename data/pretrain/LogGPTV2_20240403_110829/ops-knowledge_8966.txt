User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题how to use authconfig for ssh through LDAP connection I'm newbies on Centos7. The ssh connection is working for all user which is the /etc/passwd. That's meaning I can connect to my server with this kind of users I added 
The other users which are present in the LDAP 've got this error in the /var/log/secure file :

Nov  3 16:58:59 ghost sshd[7853]: pam_sss(sshd:account): Access denied for user user1: 6 (Permission denied)
Nov  3 16:58:59 ghost sshd[7853]: fatal: Access denied for user user1 by PAM account configuration [preauth]
Nov  3 16:59:25 ghost su: pam_unix(su-l:session): session opened for user user1 by system(uid=0)
Nov  3 16:59:28 ghost su: pam_unix(su-l:session): session closed for user user1


The id users1 is working and the su - users1 is working too.

The command authconfig --test shows me the line :

pam_pwquality is enabled (try_first_pass local_users_only retry=3 authtok_type=)


local_users_only is disturbing me but may wrong

What's the right option to give at the authconfig command

Thanks for your help

Assistant: PAM saves it configurations per daemon in directory /etc/pam.d/. You should check the sshd configuration in that directory.
