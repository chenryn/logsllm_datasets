**Question: How to Use `authconfig` for SSH via LDAP on CentOS 7**

I am new to CentOS 7 and need assistance with configuring SSH authentication through an LDAP connection. Currently, SSH connections are working for all users listed in the `/etc/passwd` file, meaning I can successfully connect to the server using these local users.

However, when attempting to connect with users present in the LDAP, I encounter the following errors in the `/var/log/secure` log file:

```
Nov  3 16:58:59 ghost sshd[7853]: pam_sss(sshd:account): Access denied for user user1: 6 (Permission denied)
Nov  3 16:58:59 ghost sshd[7853]: fatal: Access denied for user user1 by PAM account configuration [preauth]
Nov  3 16:59:25 ghost su: pam_unix(su-l:session): session opened for user user1 by system(uid=0)
Nov  3 16:59:28 ghost su: pam_unix(su-l:session): session closed for user user1
```

Despite these errors, the `id user1` command works, and I can also switch to the `user1` account using `su - user1`.

When I run the `authconfig --test` command, it shows the following line:

```
pam_pwquality is enabled (try_first_pass local_users_only retry=3 authtok_type=)
```

The `local_users_only` option seems to be causing the issue, but I may be incorrect.

**What is the correct `authconfig` command to enable SSH authentication via LDAP?**

Thank you for your help.

**Response:**

PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) stores its configurations per service in the `/etc/pam.d/` directory. To resolve the issue, you should check the `sshd` configuration file located at `/etc/pam.d/sshd`. This file contains the PAM settings specific to the SSH daemon and may provide clues about why LDAP authentication is failing.

Additionally, ensure that the `sssd` (System Security Services Daemon) is correctly configured to use LDAP. The main configuration files for `sssd` are typically found in `/etc/sssd/`, specifically `/etc/sssd/sssd.conf` and `/etc/sssd/sssd-ldap.conf`.

Here are some steps to troubleshoot and configure LDAP authentication for SSH:

1. **Check PAM Configuration:**
   - Open `/etc/pam.d/sshd` and verify that it includes the necessary lines for `pam_sss.so`:
     ```plaintext
     auth        required     pam_env.so
     auth        sufficient   pam_sss.so
     account     [default=bad success=ok user_unknown=ignore] pam_sss.so
     password    sufficient   pam_sss.so
     session     optional     pam_sss.so
     ```

2. **Check SSSD Configuration:**
   - Ensure that `/etc/sssd/sssd.conf` is properly set up to use LDAP. A basic example might look like this:
     ```ini
     [sssd]
     services = nss, pam
     config_file_version = 2
     domains = mydomain

     [domain/mydomain]
     id_provider = ldap
     auth_provider = ldap
     ldap_uri = ldap://ldap.example.com
     ldap_search_base = dc=example,dc=com
     ```

3. **Restart SSSD and SSHD:**
   - After making changes, restart the `sssd` and `sshd` services to apply the new configuration:
     ```sh
     sudo systemctl restart sssd
     sudo systemctl restart sshd
     ```

4. **Test LDAP Authentication:**
   - Try logging in again with an LDAP user to see if the issue is resolved.

If you continue to experience issues, please provide the relevant configuration files (`/etc/pam.d/sshd` and `/etc/sssd/sssd.conf`) for further analysis.
