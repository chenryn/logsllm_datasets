Note that, (i) ‚ÄúNormal‚Äù means that the volunteer regards the audio as a normal audio. (ii) ‚ÄúNoise‚Äù means that the volunteer can feel some noises. (iii) ‚ÄúTalking‚Äù means that the
volunteer can hear talking in the audio. If the volunteer thinks there is talking in the audio, he/she is then asked to recognize the content of the talking. (iv) The audio will be labeled
as ‚Äúonce-recognize‚Äù or ‚Äútwice-recognize‚Äù if the volunteer recognizes over half of the content after listening to the audio once or twice, respectively.

generate 10 AEs for each SNR group. As shown in Table 11, when
the SNR increases (i.e., the noise becomes smaller), more volunteers
consider the AE as a normal one. Specifically, when the SNR is lower
than 8dB, over 84% of volunteers can hear talking in the AE audios,
and more than 31% of volunteers can recognize the commands in
the AEs. The results validate that if the SNR is low, it is easy for
the users to notice or even recognize the AEs. Since the audio AEs
need to be stealthy enough to fool the human, AEs with high SNRs
are considered more in practice.
Figure 10: Waveforms and spectrograms of the original au-
dio and adversarial audios generated by the targeted attacks
against Alibaba SSR. The audio AEs can be recognized as
‚Äúcall my wife‚Äù.
Recall that we use two important metrics to evaluate the effective-
ness of the audio AEs, i.e., the SRoA (Success Rate of Attack) and
SNR. Both metrics are crucial to determine whether an AE can
successfully attack the target system, since an effective AE needs to
fool both the model and the human simultaneously. To demonstrate
the necessity of SNR as an evaluation criterion, we conduct a small
human study to help understand how the metric of SNR affects the
effectiveness and quality of an audio AE.
In this experiment, we surveyed 30 volunteers who are sensitive
to sound, including 17 males and 13 females. Similar to the human
perception experiment (See Section 5.3), we first show some exam-
ples of ‚Äúnoise‚Äù, ‚Äúnormal‚Äù, ‚Äútalking‚Äù, and ‚Äúrecognized‚Äù, and then ask
the volunteers to listen to the audio AEs and tell their views about
them. The audio AEs are generated from Occam against Alibaba
and Tencent, with SNRs ranging from 6dB to 16dB. Specifically, we
Due to the space limitation, we provide the detailed results of four
countermeasures against our attacks in this section. Table 14 shows
the performance of our attacks against different countermeasures,
including local smoothing, downsampling and temporal depen-
dency based approach, and Table 15 presents the performance of
our NI-Occam against adversarial training.
In our experiment of adversarial training, we adversarially train
Kaldi (the aforementioned Mini LibriSpeech model) on the Mini
LibriSpeech dataset14. We set ùëù to ‚àû, iterations to 10, and the step
size ùõº to ùúñ/5 for PGD, which are the same with [50, 51]. Since
the prior work [51] demonstrates that adversarial training with
ùúñ > 0.01 will be not able to converge, we set ùúñ to 0.002, 0.004 and
0.006. For evaluation, we also generate 10 audio AEs from Mini
LibriSpeech model.

F SUPPLEMENTARY EVALUATION OF
NI-OCCAM
As a supplement to Section 4.3, here we provide the detailed results
of our NI-Occam on 10 target phrases in Table 12. Besides, we also
conduct an experiment on the impact of the number of attempts.
In previous experiments on NI-Occam, the default setting for the
number of query attempts is 3 times, and Devil‚Äôs Whisper [32]
adopted a number of 30 attempts. Theoretically, more attempts will
lead to higher SRoAs. To illustrate this statement, we conduct an
experiment with a range of [1, 30] query attempts using NI-Occam,
and the results are given in Figure 11. As shown, at the very start,
the increasing number of query attempts can help increase the
SRoA. However, when the number of attempts is larger than 17,
the SRoA will remain at 70% and no longer increases, indicating a
performance limit. In practice, however, more attempts also require
longer attacking periods, making the attack less stealthy. Hence,
we suggest the attacker conduct as few attempts as possible.
G EVALUATION OF OCCAM AND NI-OCCAM
ON LARGE COMMAND SETS
As illustrated before, the target phrases in Devil‚Äôs Whisper [32] are
restricted to several phrases for a substitute model. Different from
Devil‚Äôs Whisper, Occam is not restricted to the number of targeted
phrases, where the adversary can express freely. To illustrate this
point, we evaluate Occam and NI-Occam on 60 targeted phrases.
In the experiment of Occam, we generate 60 audio AEs with 60
different targeted voice commands by querying Alibaba SSR 30,000
times and feed them into it. The target commands and SNRs of the
AEs are presented in Table 13. The 60 AEs have an average SNR
of 17.27dB, and all of them can be recognized as the target com-
mands successfully. For NI-Occam, we also generate 60 audio AEs
with 60 different voice commands and play the AEs to a Samsung
C9 running Cortana and an iPhone 11 running Siri. As shown in
Table 13, in total, 43 AEs have successfully attacked Cortana, i.e.,
the SRoA is 71.7%. For Siri, there are 35 effective AEs that can be
recognized as the target commands, i.e., the SRoA is 58.3%. The
results indicate that both Occam and NI-Occam can perform well
on large command sets.
