Certainly! Here is a more polished and detailed version of your text:

I have created a Docker image that includes Python libraries and Jupyter. To start the container, I use the `-p 8888:8888` option to map the ports between the host and the container.

When I launch a Jupyter kernel inside the container using the command `jupyter notebook`, it runs on `localhost:8888` and does not automatically open a browser. 

From my host machine, what IP address should I use to access the Jupyter notebook in my browser? When I run the `ifconfig` command, I see interfaces such as `eth0`, `docker0`, `wlan0`, and `lo`.

Thank you!

**Response:**

To make the Jupyter notebook accessible from your host machine, you need to bind the Jupyter server to all available network interfaces within the container. You can do this by running the following command inside the container:

```sh
jupyter notebook --ip=0.0.0.0 --port=8888
```

By binding to `0.0.0.0`, the Jupyter server will listen on all network interfaces, making it accessible from your host machine. 

Once you have started the Jupyter notebook with the above command, you can access it from your host machine by navigating to `http://<host-ip>:8888` in your web browser. The `<host-ip>` can be determined by checking the IP address of the appropriate network interface (e.g., `eth0` or `wlan0`) on your host machine.

If you are unsure which IP address to use, you can typically use `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` if you are accessing the Jupyter notebook from the same machine where the Docker container is running. If you are accessing it from a different machine, use the IP address of the host machine.

Thank you for your question!
