Hi all,  
I am getting segfaults when running the test suite. Specifically, they occur
in the manifold module.  
Furthermore, all of the examples in that module end in segfaults.
I am using Mac OS X Lion 10.7,  
the latest scipy superpack (superpack_10.7_2011.11.04.sh)  
gcc version i686-apple-darwin11-gcc-4.2.1 (GCC) 4.2.1 (Apple Inc. build 5666)
(dot 3)
I use the following flags:
declare -x CC="gcc-4.2"  
declare -x CXX="g++-4.2"  
declare -x FFLAGS="-ff2c"
Maybe I should try with different permutations of these flags.
I have to mention that I have a failing numpy test (tests polyfit) and a lot
of failing scipy tests (specifically all the ones related to symmetric arpack
modes). Detailed version and output is in this pastebin:
