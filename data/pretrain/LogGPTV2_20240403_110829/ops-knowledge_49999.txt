User: so I am trying to install kivy on my mac.From their instructions page, I am on step 2, and have to enter the command $ USE_OSX_FRAMEWORKS=0 pip install kivy. However, when I put this in terminal, I get the error error: command '/usr/bin/clang' failed with exit status 1, and as a result Failed building wheel for kivy. Does anyone know how to address this issue?
Assistant: Just had this issue, and was able to fix it following the directions on the kivy mac OS X install page, with one modification as follows:
$ brew install pkg-config sdl2 sdl2_image sdl2_ttf sdl2_mixer gstreamer
$ pip3 install Cython==0.25.2
$ pip3 install kivy
pip3 is my reference to pip for Python 3.6 as I have two different versions of python on my system. May just be pip install for you.
Hope this helps!
