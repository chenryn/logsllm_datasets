I am currently trying to install Kivy on my Mac. According to the instructions on their website, I am at step 2, which requires me to enter the following command in the terminal:

```sh
$ USE_OSX_FRAMEWORKS=0 pip install kivy
```

However, when I run this command, I encounter the following error:

```
error: command '/usr/bin/clang' failed with exit status 1
```

As a result, the wheel build for Kivy fails. Does anyone have any suggestions on how to resolve this issue?

**Solution:**

I recently faced the same problem and was able to resolve it by following the directions on the Kivy macOS installation page, with a slight modification. Here are the steps I took:

1. Install the necessary dependencies using Homebrew:
   ```sh
   $ brew install pkg-config sdl2 sdl2_image sdl2_ttf sdl2_mixer gstreamer
   ```

2. Install Cython (version 0.25.2 is recommended):
   ```sh
   $ pip3 install Cython==0.25.2
   ```

3. Finally, install Kivy:
   ```sh
   $ pip3 install kivy
   ```

Note that `pip3` refers to the Python 3.6 version of `pip` on my system, as I have multiple versions of Python installed. If you only have one version of Python, you may use `pip` instead.

I hope this helps!
