### Scaling Parameters for Feature Set \( f \)

The feature set \( f \) can be one of four different combinations of features (high/low bins of CANH/CANL). To enhance our Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to account for variations in the supply voltage level, we need to leverage this knowledge. Specifically, we extracted features from available training data at various supply voltage levels and scaled them to a specific target voltage domain. This process helps mitigate the drift in fingerprints caused by voltage variations.

Next, we need to extend this approach to supply voltage levels for which training data is not available, leading to a generalized solution. The goal is to compensate for supply voltage changes. In previous discussions, we defined different voltage domains for generating features and used regression to map features from one domain to another. We now apply this idea to our scenario.

### Estimating Matrices \( A \) and \( B \)

We estimate matrices \( A \) and \( B \) as \( n \times 1 \) matrices, where each row corresponds to a voltage level varying in the interval [3.00, 3.25] V with steps of 50 mV. The columns in \( A \) and \( B \) hold the values of \( a_0 \) and \( a_1 \) as defined in Equation 10. Depending on the type of feature \( f \) (low/high of CANH/CANL), the values of \( A \) and \( B \) are:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
a_0(v_1) \\
a_0(v_2) \\
\vdots \\
a_0(v_n)
\end{bmatrix}^\top, \quad
B = \begin{bmatrix}
a_1(v_1) \\
a_1(v_2) \\
\vdots \\
a_1(v_n)
\end{bmatrix}^\top
\]

After generating the \( A \) and \( B \) matrices, we fit another linear regression to the elements of each matrix to estimate the corresponding \( \hat{a}_0 \) and \( \hat{a}_1 \) for a new voltage level \( \hat{\nu} \) in the source domain, for which we do not have training data. This allows us to estimate the scaling parameters for mapping the features.

### Impact of Temperature

During all rounds of data collection, temperature values are recorded and stored on a per-frame basis for further analysis. We investigate the possibility of a linear relationship between the features and temperature in a controlled setup, which emulates the rise in temperature when the engine starts. This relationship can be modeled using Equation 12:

\[
F = c_0 \cdot T + c_1
\]

where \( F \) is the vector of features, \( T \) is the internal temperature, and \( c_0 \) and \( c_1 \) are the estimation parameters for the feature set \( f \), which can be one of the four different combinations of features (high/low bins of CANH/CANL). This model is validated in Section 6.2.

### Evaluation

#### Experimental Setup

An experimental setup is used to emulate ECUs connected via a CAN bus, sending messages based on the CAN protocol. The setup includes TM4C123GXL micro-controllers integrated on a TivaC launchpad, programmed to send extended CAN (2.0b) messages with 29-bit identifiers. The identifier and data section for each frame in each round of data collection are configured to be random. These devices have the same configuration, manufacturer, and purchase date. The ECUs send a CAN message every second at a data rate of 110 Kbps, and a USB2523-MCC DAQ with 12 bits of resolution is used to sample at a rate of 500 Ksps on each channel associated with CANH and CANL. Figure 7a illustrates the basic setup used for data collection.

#### Results for Constant Voltage with Natural Variations in Temperature

We emulate 10 ECUs in this setup and collect 10,000 CAN frames from each. We randomly select 2% of the data to extract feature templates and generate thresholds. The remaining data is used for the testing phase. The ECUs take turns being the legitimate device in each round of analysis, indicated as Case i, where the ith ECU is the legitimate one. The Equal Error Rates (EERs) and their corresponding thresholds are reported in Table 3a.

Table 3a shows that the features generated using SIMPLE can perfectly distinguish between the devices when \( V_{cc} \) is constant, resulting in EER values close to 0%.

#### Results for Changing Voltage with Natural Variations in Temperature

We collect new rounds of data from devices when \( V_{cc} \) is reduced by steps of 50 mV within the operating voltage range of the transceivers, covering \( V_{cc} \in \{3.00, 3.05, 3.10, 3.15, 3.20, 3.25\} \). The primary analyses show low EER results, as low as 0%, which are not presented due to space limitations.

Next, we validate the proposed solution in Section 6.1, which accounts for variations in voltage levels without exact scaling parameter training data. We collect new data at different voltages within the operating range of our transceiver (3.3 V with a drop value of within 0.3 V). Results for two sample voltage levels, \( V_{sr} = 3.275 \) V and \( V_{sr} = 3.225 \) V, are given in Tables 3b and 3c, showing EER values and their corresponding thresholds after using the estimated scaling parameters for mapping features from the source domain (no training data) to the target domain (\( V_{tg} = 3.30 \) V).

Figure 6b plots the Mahalanobis distances of features calculated during the test phase of Case 2, demonstrating SIMPLE's capability to compensate for \( V_{cc} \) variation.

#### Results for Constant Voltage with Natural Variations in Temperature

In all rounds of data collection, temperature values are collected with an ADC and temperature sensor integrated into the TivaC LaunchPad, and stored for each frame for further analysis. We train our templates for each device on different days under varying conditions, such as no air conditioning. Figure 6a shows a sample result where other ECUs take turns performing a masquerade attack on ECU01. After accounting for \( V_{cc} \) level variations, we can identify malicious frames with an EER of zero, regardless of temperature differences during the training and testing phases. Repeating the analysis over more than 70 rounds of data collection on different days, with an EER of zero, confirms that the features used by SIMPLE are robust to natural temperature changes up to ±6°C.

### Experimental Validation

#### In-lab Experiments

Using commonly available parts, we determined the factors affecting ECU fingerprints. In this section, we extend the analysis by examining emulated ECUs architected to reflect actual automotive ECUs and built using automotive-grade parts.

**Automotive Grade Transceivers:**
- **CAN Transceiver:** TJA1050, NCV7340, HA13721, TCAN332, MAX3051
- **Manufacturer:** NXP, ON Semiconductor, Renesas, Texas Instruments, Maxim Integrated
- **Quantity:** 3, 1, 2, 2, 2
- **Voltage Regulator:** TLV1117-50, TLV1117-33

**Results for Varying Voltage with Natural Variations in Temperature:**
The lab experiments in Section 6.2.1 show that fingerprints deviate mainly due to changes in voltage source values. In this setup, \( V_{cc} \) is tightly controlled via a voltage regulator. To analyze how voltage drops change the fingerprints, we tested extreme cases where \( V_{cc} \) was dropped by steps of 1 Volt, covering values \( V_{sr} = \{8, 9, 10, 11, 12\} \) V, and collected 10,000 sample frames. We then performed feature transformation to scale features collected in a source voltage level domain (any value out of \( V_{sr} = \{8, 9, 10, 11\} \) V) to a target voltage domain (12 V). Using the method from Section 6.1.1, we estimated new scaling coefficients (Equation 10) for a randomly selected voltage level in the continuous interval \( V_{sr} \in [8 : 12] \) V without collecting training data. Table 3d shows conventional analysis with 10,000 sample frames from the ECUs on the bus when \( V_{cc} = 12.00 \) V, using K-fold cross-validation for EER analysis. Table 3f shows the feature transformation coefficients trained on data collected at \( V_{sr} = \{9, 10, 11\} \) V and validated on data collected at \( V_{sr} = 8.00 \) V. Figure 6c shows a sample result where data from ECU with HA13721-02 (HA02) transceiver at \( V_{sr} = 8.00 \) V was scaled up to \( V_{tg} = 12.00 \) V and tested against other ECUs. Natural temperature variations did not affect SIMPLE's performance.

**Results for Constant Voltage with Controlled High Temperature:**
We modified the benchtop setup using a cardboard cover and increased the temperature of the ECUs using a heat gun during data collection. Figure 8a shows how the first feature of NCV7340 changed over time, with temperature changes depicted in the lower graph. We use the linear regression model (Equation 12) to correlate the features of each device to temperature values, as shown in Figure 8b for NCV7340. The average \( R^2 \) values of this fitting model are given in Table 4, validating a linear relationship between features and temperature. Both positive and negative correlations were observed, consistent across repetitive experiments. The trained linear model was tested in another round (round-b), with average MSE values close to zero, confirming the goodness of fit. In summary, SIMPLE is robust to variations in temperature and supply voltage values.

#### In-vehicle Experiments

We collected CAN messages from two vehicles, a Nissan Sentra 2016 and a Subaru Outback 2011, via the OBD-II port using a Tektronix DPO 3012 oscilloscope. The oscilloscope sampled at 50 Msps per channel with 8 bits of resolution and sent records to a computer via USB. We drove the vehicles for about forty minutes in each round, including local and highway driving.
