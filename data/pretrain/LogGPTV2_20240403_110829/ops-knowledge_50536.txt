User: Do you think that Twisted Spread may be suitable (in terms of performance) for a multiplayer racing simulator? The rest of the application is based on Python-Ogre.
Can Perspective Broker run upon (reliable?) UDP?
Assistant: It's almost certainly a reasonable protocol to start with.  Remember the cardinal rule of optimization: don't do it.  Working with any TCP-based protocol is going to be considerably easier than working with any UDP-based protocol.  This is initially much more important to the success of your project than whether it takes 30 milliseconds or 45 milliseconds to send a message between your client and server.  Eventually, when you've gotten to the point where it's clear your project might actually succeed and you really need to make up those 15 (or however many) milliseconds, you can revisit the network layer and consider whether the performance bottleneck (be it latency or some other metric) is due to your choice of protocol.  If so, that is the time to spend time evaluating various alternatives.  It's only at that point that the effort of selecting the ideal protocol might pay off (since you're that much closer to a completed project) and by then you will have a significantly improved understanding of the problem and should have nailed down your requirements very specifically, two more things which will make the task of selecting the appropriate protocol (be it TCP- or UDP-based) that much easier and more likely to be correct.
