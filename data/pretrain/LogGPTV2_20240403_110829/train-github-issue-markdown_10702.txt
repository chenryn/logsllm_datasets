# Bug report
## Describe the bug
In some circumstances, `next build` is failing in CI environment (CircleCI)
with the exception `Callback was already called'.
There is a random factor and it's not happening 100% of the time, but more
than 50% at the moment.
This is triggered from the `neo-async` package which is used by `webpack`:
    /home/circleci/project/node_modules/neo-async/async.js:14
        throw new Error('Callback was already called.');
        ^
    Error: Callback was already called.
