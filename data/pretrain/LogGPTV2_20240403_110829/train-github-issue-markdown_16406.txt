### Proposed new feature or change:
Currently we can use `median()` and `nanmedian()` to calculate the median of
an array along an axis, and we can compute other basic statistical metrics
similarly. However, there are no methods to calculate the modes of an array
directly.
I would suggest adding the method `mode()`, which returns an array of modes,
and `nanmode()`, which does the same but ignoring `NaN`s. They would work in
the same fashion as `median()` and `nanmedian()`, and I reckon that they would
be useful even to applications that are not related to statistics.
I would appreciate any suggestions or constructive criticism
