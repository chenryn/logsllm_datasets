### I. Introduction to Computer Network Operations (CNO) and the Actors Involved

#### Introduction to CNO
- Joint Pub 3-13 categorizes cyber acts under the domain of Computer Network Operations (CNO).

#### Computer Network Operations
- **Computer Network Defense (CND)**
  - Includes actions taken via computer networks to protect, monitor, analyze, detect, and respond to network attacks, intrusions, disruptions, or other unauthorized actions that would compromise or cripple defense information systems and networks.
- **Computer Network Exploitation (CNE)**
  - Includes enabling actions and intelligence collection via computer networks that exploit data gathered from target or enemy information systems or networks.
- **Computer Network Attack (CNA)**
  - Includes actions taken via computer networks to disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy the information within computers and computer networks and/or the computers/networks themselves.

#### The Actors Involved
- **Nation State vs. Nation State**
- **Nation State vs. Non-State Actor**
  - Post-9/11: UNSCR 1368
  - This study does not concern international cyber crimes or private hacker vs. private hacker scenarios.
  - **Attribution**: A significant issue but outside the scope of this study.

### II. A Brief Overview of Cyber Warfare’s Current Legal Framework

The two principal questions facing military operations in cyberspace are:
1. Which interstate activities in cyberspace constitute a threat or use of force under international law?
2. When such a threat or use of force constitutes an armed attack under international law, how does the law of armed conflict apply to the lawful exercise of the inherent right of self-defense in cyberspace?

**Two Regimes:**
1. **Pre-Hostilities Law (Jus ad Bellum)**
   - **UN Charter Article 2(4)**
     - All members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.
     - The UN Security Council has the exclusive power to determine when an act is a use of force and respond to such acts.
   - **Article 51: Right to Self-Defense**
     - Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense.
   - General prohibition against all uses of force, except those sanctioned by the UN Security Council or done in self-defense.

2. **Post-Hostilities Law (Jus in Bello)**
   - Once two nations are in armed conflict, the law of war applies.
   - The law of war must apply in all military operations, including cyber operations.
   - Only lawful military targets may be attacked.
   - When deciding if a target can be attacked, a combatant commander must consider:
     - **Distinction**
     - **Balancing Military Necessity with Humanity**
     - **Proportionality**

#### Distinction
- **Formal distinction between combatants and non-combatants**
- **Duty to conduct warfare in manners that minimize harm to civilians**
  - **Article 50**: Defines who are civilians and civilian populations.
  - **Article 51**: Describes protections to be given to civilian populations.
  - **Article 52**: Regulates targeting civilian objects.
  - **Article 57**: Outlines specific steps commanders must take to verify what isn't a civilian object.

#### Distinction: Cyber Implications
- Example: Releasing a computer virus in a network essential to civilian function (e.g., banking or electrical power) will likely violate the principle of distinction.
- **Interconnective nature of the internet causes networks to have dual use.**
- **Civilian ISPs provide online networks to civilians and support military objectives of communication.**
- **Commanders must take reasonable steps to limit attacks on parts of a network used by the enemy combatant.**

#### Military Necessity and Humanity
- **Necessity**: Attack on a target must further legitimate military objectives or grant a definite military advantage.
- **Humanity**: Attack shouldn't cause unnecessary suffering or unwarranted injury for a military purpose.
- **Cyber Example**: Attack on an enemy computer system that controls the enemy's power supply (SCADA). Necessity is clear, but humanity is more complex, especially if the power also supplies a civilian hospital.

#### Proportionality
- Determine if the benefits from winning military objectives outweigh the negative collateral effects, such as extensive power loss to civilian populations.
- **Deontology**: "Ends justify the means."
- **Business Language**: Essentially a ROI analysis.
- **Tool for balancing military necessity and humanity.**
- **Attacker has the responsibility to take reasonable steps to determine the potential collateral damage of the contemplated attack.**

### III. Popular Issues Intensifying the Cyber Warfare Debate

#### The “Use of Force?” Debate
- **Schmitt/Wingfield Multifactor Tests**
- **Security Council Authority**: Sole authority and discretion to ratify any use of force, including mild cyber attacks.
- **Article 51 of the UN Charter**: Provides for the right of countries to engage in military action in self-defense, including collective self-defense.
- **Should the Security Council Adopt a Multifactor Test?**
- **All Uses of Force are Presumed to be Forbidden**
- **Criticisms of Multifactor Tests**

#### The “Use of Force?” Debate
- **Rule (In Dondi’s Opinion)**: A nation conducting any CNA, prior to hostilities, is legally doing so only in the case of reasonable self-defense. If self-defense is not involved, the nation actor is conducting CNA with the risk of being sanctioned by the UN Council.
- **Implication**: The UN Council needs to implement means of monitoring all state-sponsored acts of CNA and become more aggressive in holding countries accountable for cyber acts, which is a challenge in itself, but it does not imply that the international laws of war are inadequate.

#### The “Cyber Arms Race” Analogy
- **“A ‘dead heat’ is a race, campaign, or other contest that is so close that it is impossible to predict the winner. That’s what it looks like when it comes to the continuing race for cyber warfare supremacy, and experts agree this will be the case for the foreseeable future. With images of the Cold War and its associated arms race, as cyber warfare, cyber espionage, cyber attacks, and cyber terrorism continue to evolve, the top three leaders (US, Russia, and China) are jockeying for position.” —Defense Tech**
- **Nuclear Weapons vs. Cyber Weapons**
- **The Cyber Threat is Real, but Shouldn’t Be Compared to Nuclear Weapons**
- **Nuclear Treaties vs. Cyber Treaties**

#### The Cyber Threat Debate
- On June 8, 2010, Booz Allen Executive Vice President Mike McConnell and his debate partner, Harvard law professor Jonathan Zittrain, jointly debated two opponents on the topic of cyber threat titled “The Cyber War Threat Has Been Grossly Exaggerated.” McConnell and Zittrain faced off against privacy advocate Marc Rotenberg and security technologist Bruce Schneier, who argued in favor of the measure—that the threat has been exaggerated.
- At the close of the fast-paced and entertaining discussion, the McConnell/Zittrain arguments had swayed 71% of the audience to their position, vs. 23% for the opponents and only 6% undecided.
- **Dondi’s Opinion**: Cyber is the new Fire. Cybersecurity awareness must become ingrained in our society like fire safety.
  - It is hard to exaggerate the threat or dangers of fire.
  - **Dondi’s “Fire-Marshal Bill” Test**: The threat is real, but when it comes to cybersecurity, we should only throw the flag in the event of gross exaggeration.

### IV. Arguments Against Creating a Distinct Body of International Treaty for Cyber Warfare Law

#### Fields of Law Are Seldom Demarcated by Technology
- **Sommer Argument**
  - **Laws of Spears, Bows, Arrows, and Shields**
  - **Treaty Against Imitating Paranormal Activity During Warfare**
  - **Law of Equestrian Warfare (Horse Law)**
  - **Law of the Semi-Automatic Rifle**
  - **Hague Rules of Aerial Warfare**
  - **Treaty Banning the Use of Environmental Modification Techniques in Warfare**
  - **Protocol Banning Weapons Whose Fragments Cannot be Detected by X-ray**
  - **Protocol Banning the Use of Blinding Lasers**
- **Current Rules of War**: Prior to and during hostility, encompass cyber warfare.

#### Undue Limitations on a Primarily Non-Lethal Strategic Deterrence
- Because cyber warfare is primarily non-lethal and due to its deterrence capability, it may be the greater of two evils when compared to traditional kinetic weaponry such as missiles.
- In light of the UN Charter’s guiding principle of preserving human life, proponents of the creation of a cyber warfare treaty should consider that such a treaty may have the effect of limiting a primarily non-lethal weapon and possibly shift the weaponry trend back to the use of kinetic weapons.

#### Our Real Adversaries Are Unlikely to Comply with a Cyber Treaty
- Creating an international law will, therefore, have the actual effect of crippling our warfighting ability while our real adversaries continue to run rogue.
- If we were to enter into a cyber warfare treaty, we would essentially be volunteering to fight war “with one hand behind our back,” while those we are likely to fight against will do so with no rule of law in mind—let alone a rule governing cyber warfare.

#### The Rate of Technology Will Outpace the Ability for an International Cyber Regime to Produce Responsive Policy
- While the flexibility allotted by the UN Charter can absorb technological advances, the rate of technology will outpace the ability for an international cyber regime to produce responsive policy.

### Conclusion
- The laws of war will be tested by cyber warfare in two situations: first, prior to the commencement of an armed conflict; second, when an armed conflict is ongoing.
- In each of these situations, the current laws of war can address the emerging issues raised by cyber warfare.
- Although several hot-button issues related to cyber warfare are often discussed and fuel the cyber warfare debate, they may not be issues at all. A careful analysis shows that the current UN Charter and Laws of War should continue to govern cyber warfare.
- Creating an international treaty or law for cyber warfare would do more harm than good and seriously cripple our ability to conduct war.
