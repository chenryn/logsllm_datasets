Introduction to CNO
Joint Pub 3-13 Categorizes Cyber Acts Under the Domain of 
Computer Network Operations (CNO)
6
Computer Network Operations
 The term ―Cyber‖ is used in a overly broad manner
 It is necessary to understand Cyber within the context of which of the 
three CNO domains are being referenced
 Computer Network Defense (“CND”)
– Includes actions taken via computer networks to 
protect, monitor, analyze, detect and respond to 
network attacks, intrusions, disruptions or other 
unauthorized actions that would compromise or cripple 
defense information systems and networks
 Computer Network Exploitation (“CNE”)
– Includes enabling actions and intelligence collection 
via computer networks that exploit data gathered from 
target or enemy information systems or networks
 Computer Network Attack (“CNA”)
– Includes actions taken via computer networks to 
disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy the information 
within computers and computer networks and/or the 
computers/networks themselves

II. A Brief Overview of Cyber Warfare’s 
Current Legal Framework
The two principle questions facing military operations in cyberspace are:
1. Which interstate activities in cyberspace constitute a threat or use of force 
under international law, and
2. When such a threat or use of force does constitute an armed attack under 
international law, how does that law of armed conflict apply to the  lawful 
exercise of the inherent right of self defense in cyberspace.*
Two regimes: (1) Pre-Hostilities Law; and (2) Post-Hostilities Law
* Thomas C. Wingfield & James B. Michael, An Introduction to Legal Aspects of Operations in Cyberspace 10 (Naval Postgraduate School) (explaining that two 
important legal issues related to cyber warfare are (1) when does a CNA constitute a threat or use of force, and (2) how do the laws of armed conflict govern 
cyber warfare) (2004); see also Jeffrey Carr, Inside Cyber Warfare 31-43 (Mike Loukides ed., O’Reilly Media 2010) (2009).

Pre-Hostilities Law (Jus ad Bellum)
 UN Charter Article 2(4)
– All members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat 
or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence 
of any state, or any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of 
the United Nations
– UNSC has the exclusive power to determine when an act is a use of 
force and respond to such acts.
 Article 51: Right to Self Defense
– Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of 
individual or collective self defense…
 There is a general prohibition against ALL uses of force, except those:
– Sanctioned by the UN Security Council; OR
– Done in Self-Defense
10
Post-Hostilities Law (Jus in Bello)
 Once two nations are in armed conflict with each other, the law of war 
applies.
 The Law of War must apply in ALL military operations. Cyber operations 
NOT exempt.
 Only Lawful Military Targets may be attacked. 
 When deciding if a target can be attacked, a combatant commander must 
consider:
– Distinction
– Balancing Military Necessity With Humanity
– Proportionality
11
Distinction
1) Must  be formal distinction between combatant and non-combatants 
AND
2) Duty to conduct warfare in manners that minimize harms to civilians
• Article 50: defines who are civilians and civilian populations
• Article 51: describes protections to be given to civilian populations
• Article 52: regulation of targeting civilian objects
• Article 57: outlines specific steps commanders must take in order to 
verify what isn‘t a civilian object in nature
12
Distinction: Cyber Implications
Example: Releasing a comp virus in a network essential to civilian 
function such as a banking or electrical power will likely violate the 
principle of distinction.
 Interconnective nature of 
internet causes networks to 
have duel use
 Civilian ISP provide online 
networks to civilians and 
support military objectives of 
communication
 Commanders must take 
reasonable steps to limit 
attacks on part of a network 
used by the enemy combatant 
13
Military Necessity and Humanity
Caveats:
A. Necessity:  Attack on target must 
further legit military objectives or 
grant a definite military advantage.
B. Humanity:  Attack shouldn‘t cause 
unnecessary suffering or 
unwarranted injury for a military 
purpose.
Cyber ex:
 Attack on enemy computer system that controls 
enemy‘s power supply (SCADA)
 Necessity here is easy…
 Humanity…. NOT SO EASY
 What if that power also supplies a civilian 
hospital?
14
Proportionality
٭ Determine if benefits from 
winning military objectives 
outweigh its negative collateral 
effects like extensive power 
loss to civilian populations
1. Deontology: ―ends justify the means‖
2. Business Language: Essentially a ROI Analysis
3. Tool for balancing military necessity and humanity
4. Attacker has responsibility to take reasonable 
steps to determine what collateral damage to 
contemplated attack can cause
15
III. Popular Issues Intensifying 
Cyber Warfare Debate
16
The “Use of Force?” Debate
 Schmitt/Wingfield Multifactor Tests
 The Security Council has the sole authority and discretion to ratify any use of 
force; to include a very mild cyber attack
 Article 51 of the UN Charter provides for the right of countries to engage in 
military action in self defense, including collective self-defense
– Should the Security Counsel Adopt a Multifactor Tests?
– All Uses of Force are Presumed to be Forbidden
– Criticisms of Multifactor Tests
17
The “Use of Force?” Debate
 The Rule (In Dondi‘s Opinion): A nation conducting any CNA, prior to 
hostilities, is legally doing so only in the case of reasonable self-defense; if 
self-defense is not involved, then the nation actor is conducting CNA with the 
risk of being sanctioned by the UN Council
– This may imply that the UN Council needs to implement means of 
monitoring all state-sponsored acts of CNA and become more aggressive 
in holding countries accountable for cyber acts, which is a challenge in 
and of itself, but it does not imply that the international laws of war are 
inadequate
18
The “Cyber Arms Race” Analogy
 ―A ‗dead heat‘ is a race, campaign or other contest that is so close that it is 
impossible to predict the winner. That‘s what it looks like when it comes to 
the continuing race for cyber warfare supremacy, and experts agree this will 
be the case for the foreseeable future. With images of the Cold War and its 
associated arms race, as cyber warfare, cyber espionage, cyber attacks and 
cyber terrorism continues to evolve the top three leaders (US, Russia and 
China) are jockeying for position.‖ —Defense Tech
 Nuclear Weapons -vs- Cyber Weapons
 The Cyber threat is real, but shouldn‘t 
be compared to Nuclear Weapons
 Nuclear Treaties  Cyber Treaties
19
The Cyber Threat DebateThe “Cyber Arms Race” 
Analogy
 On June 8, 2010, Booz Allen Executive Vice President Mike McConnell and 
his debate partner, Harvard law professor Jonathan Zittrain, jointly debated 
two opponents on the topic of cyber threat titled “The Cyber War Threat Has 
Been Grossly Exaggerated,” and McConnell and Zittrain faced off against 
privacy advocate Marc Rotenberg and security technologist Bruce Schneier, 
who argued in favor of the measure -- that the threat has been exaggerated.
 At the close of the fast paced and entertaining discussion, the 
McConnell/Zittrain arguments had swayed 71% of the audience to their 
position, vs. 23% for the opponents and only 6% undecided.
 Dondi’s Opinion: Cyber is the new Fire. Cybersecurity awareness must 
become engrained in our society like fire safety. 
– It is hard to exaggerate the threat or dangers of fire.
 Dondi‘s ―Fire-Marshal Bill‖ Test: The threat is real, but when it comes to cyber  
security, we should only throw the flag in the event of Gross Exaggeration.

IV. Arguments Against Creating a Distinct Body of 
and International Treaty for Cyber Warfare Law
21
Fields of Law are Seldom Demarcated by Technology
 Sommer Argument
– The Laws of Spears, Bows, Arrows and Shields 
– The Treaty Against Imitating Paranormal 
Activity During Warfare
– The Law of Equestrian Warfare (Horse Law)
– The Law of the Semi-Automatic Rifle
– The Hague Rules of Aerial Warfare
– The treaty Banning the Use of Environmental 
Modification Techniques in Warfare
– Protocol Banning Weapons whose Fragments 
Cannot be Detected by X-ray
– Protocol Banning the use of Blinding Lasers
 The current rules of war, prior to, and during 
hostility, encompass cyber warfare
22
Undue Limitations on a Primarily Non-Lethal 
Strategic Deterrence
 Because cyber warfare is primarily non-lethal, and due to its 
deterrence capability, it may be the greater of two evils when it is 
compared to traditional kinetic weaponry such as missiles
 In light of the UN Charter‘s guiding principle of preserving human life, 
proponents of the creation of a cyber warfare treaty should consider 
the fact that such a treaty may have the effect of limiting a primarily 
non-lethal weapon, and possibly shift the weaponry trend back to the 
use of kinetic weapons
23
Our Real Adversaries are Unlikely to Comply with a 
Cyber Treaty
 Creating an international law will, therefore, have the actual effect of crippling 
our warfighting ability, while our real adversaries continue to run rogue
 If we were to enter into a cyber warfare treaty, we would essentially be 
volunteering to fight war ―with one hand behind our back,‖ while those we are 
likely to fight against will do so with no rule of law in mind—let alone a rule 
governing cyber warfare
24
The rate of technology will outpace the ability for an international cyber 
regime to produce responsive policy, while the flexibility allotted by the 
UN Charter are able to absorb technological advances.
25
Conclusion
 The laws of war will be tested by cyber warfare in two situations: first, prior to 
the commencement of an armed conflict; second, when an armed conflict is 
ongoing.  In each of these situations, the current laws of war can address the 
emerging issues raised by cyber warfare.  
 Although several hot-button issues related to cyber warfare are often 
discussed and fuel the cyber warfare debate, they may not be issues at all.   
A careful analysis shows that the current UN Charter and Laws of War 
should continue to govern cyber warfare.  
 Creating an international treaty or law for cyber warfare would do more harm 
than good and seriously cripple our ability to conduct war.
