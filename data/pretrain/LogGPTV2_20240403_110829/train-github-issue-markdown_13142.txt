When building a Pipeline with custom transformers, what is the best way to
serialize that for later use?
If you use pickle, you need to define those functions in the new environment,
so that doesn't seem like a solution to me. I ran into the same issue with
dill and joblib.
What is the best practice here?
Thanks!
