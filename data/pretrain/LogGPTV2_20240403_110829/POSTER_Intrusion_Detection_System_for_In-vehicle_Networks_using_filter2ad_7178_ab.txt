| Y-rate               | ±30 [deg/s]     | 0.76                        |
| B-Torque             | ±210 [Nm]       | 1e-4                        |

**Note:** Variable ranges are estimates based on traffic data.

### Detection Performance

The proposed system was evaluated for its spoofing message detection performance, alongside two conventional systems. The first conventional system monitored message reception intervals, while the second monitored time-series variations of the control data. The latter system used previously received normal data to estimate the current value of the control data. If the difference between the current value and the estimate exceeded a predefined threshold, the message was determined to be a spoofing message.

#### Evaluation Indices
- **Sensitivity (True Positive Rate):** The proportion of actual spoofing messages that were correctly identified as such. A sensitivity of 1 indicates that all inserted spoofing messages were detected.
- **True Negative Rate:** The proportion of actual normal messages that were correctly identified as such. A true negative rate of 1 implies that no normal messages were incorrectly identified as spoofing messages.

These indices are expressed by the following equations:

\[
\text{Sensitivity} = \frac{\text{True Positives}}{\text{True Positives} + \text{False Negatives}}
\]

\[
\text{True Negative Rate} = \frac{\text{True Negatives}}{\text{True Negatives} + \text{False Positives}}
\]

#### Test Setup
The test used an attack model where vehicle speed data (approximately 60 km/h) was repeatedly sent. The attacker ECU then sent spoofing messages using two methods: a straight attack and a jab attack.

- **Straight Attack:** The tampered speed of 81 km/h was repeatedly sent.
- **Jab Attack:** The attacker ECU gradually increased the speed from 60 km/h to 81 km/h at 1.5 km/h intervals, followed by repeated transmission of the tampered speed of 81 km/h.

#### Results
- **Conventional System (Message Reception Intervals):**
  - **Sensitivity:** 1 (for both straight and jab attacks)
  - **True Negative Rate:** 0.7
  - **Observations:** This system failed to distinguish between normal and spoofing messages when both were within the allowable range of message reception intervals, leading to a low true negative rate.

- **Conventional System (Time-Series Variation):**
  - **Sensitivity (Straight Attack):** 1
  - **True Negative Rate (Straight Attack):** 1
  - **Sensitivity (Jab Attack):** 0
  - **True Negative Rate (Jab Attack):** 0.5
  - **Observations:** During the jab attack, the system initially failed to detect the gradual increase in speed, leading to all spoofing messages being incorrectly identified as normal. Once the tampered speed reached 81 km/h, the system incorrectly identified all normal messages as spoofing messages.

- **Proposed System:**
  - **Sensitivity (Straight Attack):** 1
  - **True Negative Rate (Straight Attack):** 1
  - **Sensitivity (Jab Attack):** 0.99
  - **True Negative Rate (Jab Attack):** 0.99
  - **Observations:** The proposed system showed higher detection performance, with only one minor error occurring immediately after the jab attack began. The system correctly identified all subsequent spoofing messages.

### Conclusion
The proposed anomaly-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for in-vehicle networks demonstrated superior performance in detecting both straight and jab attacks compared to conventional systems. The system uses a vehicle data model based on correlated control data to monitor sensor-based control data, achieving high accuracy and reliability. This system can help identify and mitigate cyberattacks, reducing the time and scope of countermeasures needed.
