# Estonian Measurement Study on TLS Client Certificate Authentication (CCA)

## A. Background

In Estonia, every citizen aged 15 and above is required to obtain a state-issued ID card in the form of a smart card. This card contains two public-key certificates and corresponding RSA key pairs, one for TLS CCA and the other for qualified digital signatures. This has led to the widespread adoption of TLS CCA in Estonia, with most major service providers offering it as an authentication option for their e-services.

To understand the practical deployment of TLS CCA and how the issues described in this paper are handled, we conducted a measurement study on 87 public Estonian websites that provide a TLS CCA option. The tests were performed using a black-box method between March 5, 2013, and April 19, 2013. The results may have alternative explanations, but they provide valuable insights into the current state of TLS CCA implementation.

### B. Evaluation and Results

#### 1. Testing Methodology and Results

**Spare Certificate Authorities (CAs):**

The certificates included in an Estonian ID card are issued by the SK intermediate CA ESTEID-SK 2007. Since the SK root CA certificate will expire soon, certificates issued after July 2011 are now issued by the intermediate CA ESTEID-SK 2011, which is signed by the new SK root CA. Therefore, the server-side trust store should contain four certificates: two SK root CA certificates and two corresponding intermediate CA certificates.

We analyzed the list of CA DNs provided in the server's `CertificateRequest` message to identify spare (potentially superfluous) and missing certificates in the serverâ€™s trust store. We removed certificates issued by the two SK root CAs from the list of spares, as the presence of intermediate certificates in the trust store does not affect trust settings, as discussed in Section III-B.

A positive number in the "Spare" column likely indicates a server misconfiguration. This misconfiguration could allow an attacker to impersonate a user if the attacker obtains a client certificate containing the user's personal data, signed by any of the spare CAs or their subordinate CAs.

### Additional Security Considerations

**Strong Locked Same-Origin Policy:**

Implementing a strong locked same-origin policy would enhance the security value of Extended Validation (EV) server certificates. An attacker who fraudulently obtains a low-assurance Domain Validation (DV) certificate would not be able to hijack an EV-authenticated connection to the legitimate server. However, this opt-in policy would not protect against attackers capable of impersonating TLS servers if the website imports or exports content from/to other origins.

### Conclusion

This study provides a comprehensive analysis of TLS CCA deployment in Estonia, highlighting the importance of proper configuration and the potential risks associated with misconfigurations. The findings underscore the need for robust security practices and continuous monitoring to ensure the integrity and security of TLS CCA implementations.
