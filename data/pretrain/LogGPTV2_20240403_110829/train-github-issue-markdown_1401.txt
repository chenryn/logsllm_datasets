### Actual behavior
### How to reproduce
Tray works in development, but once I run build and install the app, tray
doesn't work.
$ git clone https://github.com/ehguo/ZenFocus -b tray  
$ yarn  
$ yarn run package-win
Installer found in the "release" folder in root directory
$ yarn run dev  
will confirm that it works in development.
Relevant files can be found in `app/electron/tray/index.js` and
`app/main.dev.js` (very last line)
