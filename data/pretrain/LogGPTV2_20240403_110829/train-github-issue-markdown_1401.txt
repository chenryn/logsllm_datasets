### Issue Details

- **Electron Version:** 1.6.10
- **Operating System:** Windows 10

### Expected Behavior
The tray icon should function correctly both in the development environment and after the application is built and installed.

### Actual Behavior
The tray icon works as expected during development, but it fails to function after the application is built and installed.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   $ git clone https://github.com/ehguo/ZenFocus -b tray
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies:
   ```sh
   $ cd ZenFocus
   $ yarn
   ```

3. Build the application for Windows:
   ```sh
   $ yarn run package-win
   ```

4. The installer will be located in the `release` folder at the root of the project directory.

5. Verify that the tray icon works in the development environment by running:
   ```sh
   $ yarn run dev
   ```

6. Install the built application and observe that the tray icon does not work.
