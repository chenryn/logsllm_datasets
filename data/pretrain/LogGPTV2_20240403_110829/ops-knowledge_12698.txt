User: How to achieve zero-downtime upgrades to ensure business continuity and stability?
Assistant: 1. Using containerization technology Containerization technology can package the application and its dependencies into a complete runtime environment and deploy it to the cloud server. When the program needs to be updated, it only needs to install the new version in the new container. Version program, and then move the traffic to the new container, the whole process without downtime. 2. Using grayscale release The grayscale release method can release the new version of the program to the production environment in batches. Let some users use the new version of the program first to observe whether its operation is stable. If it is stable, gradually release all Users switch to the new version of the program, which enables zero-downtime upgrades. 3. Using dual-system hot backup Dual-system hot backup refers to purchasing two servers and deploying the same program to the two servers. One of the servers serves as the main server to provide business services, and the other serves as the backup server. When the main server appears In case of failure, the backup server will immediately take over business services, thus ensuring business continuity and stability. 4. Using online database migration The database is an important part of the application program. When migrating the database, it needs to be shut down for maintenance. If the online database migration technology can be used, it can avoid downtime maintenance, that is, it can be used between different servers without stopping the database service. Migrating databases between. 5. Adopt distributed architecture Under the distributed architecture, the application program is split into multiple services, and each service can be upgraded independently, so that each service can be upgraded with zero downtime, which improves the reliability and fault tolerance of the business system sex.
