INTRODUCTION
Organizations are increasingly choosing EDB Postgres
Enterprise as a standard Relational Database Management
System for new and existing applications.
EDB Postgres Enterprise provides the performance, security, manageability features, and capabilities
required to power enterprise workloads. This frees up expensive proprietary database money that can
be redirected to new applications and digital transformation initiatives.
This potential to free up money in core IT is especially true for organizations using Oracle because EDB
Postgres Enterprise is also compatible with Oracle. EDB Postgres’ compatibility allows it:
• To be used as a substitute for Oracle for new applications,
• To migrate existing Oracle apps preserving investments in PL/SQL,
• To complement and coexist with their existing Oracle infrastructure.
This guide is intended to help you evaluate EDB Postgres’ capabilities and identify the workloads and
applications where EDB Postgres Enterprise can be used in place of Oracle.

In the pages that follow, you will find:
• A comparison of various aspects of Oracle Enterprise Edition from Oracle with EDB Postgres
Enterprise (EPE) featuring the EDB Postgres Advanced Server (EPAS) database from
EnterpriseDB (EDB).
• An emphasis on the issues of greatest interest to EDB prospects and customers as communicated
to us since EDB’s founding in 2004.
• A limited compilation of some options and tools used in the database or with the database software
in common deployments.
Also note that the following information is not intended to be:
• A competitive comparison of all of Oracle’s or all of EDB Postgres’ capabilities and
business practices.
• A comparison of capabilities specific to any one version of Oracle. It’s also important to note that
EDB’s database compatibility features are driven specifically by customer requests, which span
many versions of Oracle.
• Product documentation. This information does not reflect Oracle or EDB’s product documentation.
It also does not include all of EDB Postgres Advanced Server’s compatibility features - only the
most popular ones. For a comprehensive list of features and official documentation, refer to the
information links below.

Notes on Compatibility with Oracle
Database administrators and application developers commonly ask, “Which version of Oracle are you
compatible with?” EDB has developed database compatibility for Oracle based on popular features
across many versions of Oracle. EDB’s goal has always been to create a critical mass of compatibility
for the most popular features regardless of Oracle version to enable EDB Postgres Enterprise to support
Oracle workloads and provide end users significant cost savings for a large portion, or in some cases all,
of their Oracle footprint.
In selecting new features for every software release, EDB focuses on the most popular features whose
value to customers meets one or more of the following criteria:
Reduced Technical Risk: This refers to objects or code created in Oracle that
can be migrated and executed “as is” against or inside an EDB Postgres
Advanced Server database and behave or produce the identical result as
they would in Oracle.
Reduced Re-Training Risk: This means that knowledge, skills, and tools most
frequently used with Oracle can also be used with EDB Postgres Advanced Server,
significantly reducing the learning curve needed to be productive quickly in either
creating new applications or migrating old ones.
Reduced Integration Risk: This means that EDB Postgres Advanced Server
databases and applications can integrate well with existing Oracle infrastructure
and non-database software that will be retained or cannot be changed for the
foreseeable future.

General / Capabilities
There are a few foundational details prospective users should understand straight away when
comparing Oracle’s database with EDB Postgres Advanced Server. Both are mature, enterprise-class
object-relational databases that meet the industry standards for atomicity, consistency, isolation, and
durability (ACID) compliance. It’s also important to note the products were both developed from the same
seminal IBM research on System R, and designed to solve many of the same problems and so there is a
great deal of similarity.

Terminology
For all the work that has gone into making SQL a standard, there are still differences in nomenclature
used in many SQL based products. Some of the more important and perhaps non-obvious differences
are noted below.
Terminology Oracle Enterprise EDB Postgres Enterprise
TABLE OR INDEX Table or Index Table, Index, or Relation
ROW Row Row or Tuple
COLUMN Column Column or Attribute

DATA BLOCK Data Block
When Block is on Disk.

Each instance of EDB Postgres Advanced Server is referred to as a “cluster.” A cluster is comprised of a data
directory that contains all data and configuration files and can be referred to in two ways: by location of the data
directory or by port number. A single server can have many installations and you can create multiple clusters using
the command: initdb.

Capacities
Some of the first questions raised when considering a new database involve capacity. DBAs and
developers need to understand whether a new solution has the capacity to support existing application
data designs, workloads, and anticipated growth. Applying the capacity of a new solution to an
organization’s workloads and future applications means understanding how it supports data across
multiple structures within the database.
Capacities Oracle Enterprise EDB Postgres Enterprise
MAX. DATABASE SIZE Unlimited Unlimited
MAX. TABLE SIZE 4 GB x Block Size 32 TB
MAX. ROW SIZE 4 TB 1.6 TB
For BLOB:

Tables and Partitioning
The range of constructs within the database and how much flexibility DBAs have in organizing these
structures can impact performance as well as maintenance and other operational requirements. The
ability to partition a database improves performance, for example. Organizing data into distinct structures
and distributing them across the infrastructure also improves manageability, availability, and load
balancing. Materialized views allow DBAs to replace slow, resource-intensive runtime queries, complex
joins, or lengthy scans of data with simple, faster reads from pre-joined, pre-sorted, and stored results.

Data Types
Data types provide various ways for a DBMS to define, implement, and use information within the system
and put constraints on how data is interpreted by the database when multiple data types are in use.
EDB Postgres Advanced Server has very strong compatibility with Oracle data types and is highly
extensible allowing it to very quickly support new and emerging data types and workloads as they
become popular.
