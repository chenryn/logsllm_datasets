## Introduction to SHODAN

### What is SHODAN?

**SHODAN (http://www.shodanhq.com/)** is a specialized search engine designed by web developer John Matherly (http://twitter.com/achillean). Unlike traditional content search engines like Google, Yahoo, or Bing, which index web pages, SHODAN interrogates ports and indexes the resulting banners. This allows users to find specific nodes (e.g., desktops, servers, routers, switches) with specific content in their banners.

#### Key Differences:
- **Content Search Engines:** Crawl and index web pages.
- **SHODAN:** Interrogates ports and indexes banners, helping users locate specific devices and services.

#### Banner Knowledge:
To optimize search results, it is essential to have a basic understanding of banners, as they advertise service and version information. Banners can be spoofed, but this is uncommon.

## Basic Operations

### SHODAN Helper and Add-ons
- **Firefox Add-on:** SHODAN Helper
- **Search Provider:** SHODAN Search Provider

### Search
- **Search Terms:** Enter terms into a text box.
- **Quotation Marks:** Narrow the search.
- **Boolean Operators:** Use `+` and `-` to include and exclude query terms (default is `+`).

### Login
- **Account Creation:** Create and log in using a SHODAN account.
- **Alternative Logins:** Use Google, Twitter, Yahoo, AOL, Facebook, or OpenID.
- **Login Benefits:** Country and net filters are available only after logging in. Exporting data also requires a login.

### Filters
- **Country:** Filter by two-letter country code.
- **Hostname:** Filter by specified text in the hostname or domain.
- **Net:** Filter by specific IP range or subnet.
- **OS:** Search for specific operating systems.
- **Port:** Narrow the search for specific services.

### Example Filters
- **Country Filter:** Click on the country map for the number of scanned hosts.
- **Hostname Filter:** Search for specific hostnames or domains.
- **Net/OS Filters:** Refine searches by IP/CIDR notation or operating system.
- **Port Filter:** Current collection includes ports 21 (FTP), 22 (SSH), 23 (Telnet), and 80 (HTTP). More ports/services are coming.

### Searches
- **Popular Searches:** Available on the main page.
- **Save and Share:** Logged-in users can save and share searches.

### Export
- **Export Data:** Up to 1,000 results per credit in XML format.
- **Credits:** Purchase credits online.
- **Sample Data:** A sample export file is available.

## Penetration Testing with SHODAN

### Ethical Considerations
- **No Authentication:** Is it acceptable to view the configuration of a device that requires no authentication?
- **Default Credentials:** Is it ethical to use default usernames and passwords?
- **Unique Credentials:** Is it ethical to use unique usernames and passwords?
- **Configuration Changes:** Is it ethical to change the configuration of any device?

### HTTP Status Codes
- **200 OK:** Request succeeded.
- **401 Unauthorized:** Request requires authentication.
- **403 Forbidden:** Request is denied regardless of authentication.

### Assumptions
- **200 OK:** Banners will load without initial authentication.
- **401 Unauthorized:** Banners with `Www-authenticate` indicate a username and password pop-up box.
- **Banners Advertise Defaults:** Some banners may advertise default credentials.

## Case Studies

### Case Study 1: Cisco Devices
- **401 Unauthorized Banner:** Indicates the requirement for a username and password.
- **200 OK Banner:** No `Www-authenticate` line, suggesting no initial authentication required.
- **Comparison:** The `Last-modified` line is often mutually exclusive with `Www-authenticate`.

### Case Study 2: Default Passwords
- **Search Term:** "default password" locates servers with these words in the banner.
- **Low-Hanging Fruit:** These devices may be using default credentials, making them easy targets.

### Case Study 3: Infrastructure Exploitation
- **Example:** Two Cisco 3750 infrastructure switches with direct access to a Cisco 7606 Router.
- **VLAN IDs:** For internal ISP networks, hotels, condos, apartments, convention centers, and public backbones.
- **SNMP Information:** Server IP address and community strings.

### Other Examples
- **General Observations:** Various HTML links and configurations that may not require additional authentication.

## The Future of SHODAN

- **API Integration:** An API is in development for program integration.
- **Summary Reports:** Export options for summary reports.
- **Software Fingerprints:** Enhanced software fingerprinting.
- **HTTPS Collection:** Expanded collection to include HTTPS.

## Conclusions

- **Information Aggregation:** SHODAN aggregates a significant amount of information in an easy-to-understand format.
- **Passive Vulnerability Analysis:** Allows for passive vulnerability analysis.
- **Game-Changer:** SHODAN is a potential game-changer for penetration testers, shaping the future of vulnerability assessments.
