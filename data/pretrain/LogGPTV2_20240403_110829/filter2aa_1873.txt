### Conducting Massive Attacks with Open Source Distributed Computing

#### How to (Almost) Get Fired from Your Job

1. **Speak at a Hacker Conference on Your Open-Source, Community-Focused Side Project (PunkSPIDER):**
   - Combined distributed computing (my main area of research) with web application fuzzing.
   - It was pretty cool (if I do say so myself).

2. **Have a Friend of a High-Level Executive at Your Company Stumble Upon Your Talk:**
   - This friend confuses your community-focused web app security side project for a “cyber weapon” and tells the executive that you’re building a cyber weapon in your spare time.

3. **The Result:**
   - You almost get fired.

#### Why Did I Just Tell You That Story?

- **Inspiration for This Talk:**
  - It got me thinking about:
    - What it would take to build true distributed network attack tools.
    - Where distributed computing can be most helpful.
    - How to simply and quickly build distributed attack tools for various purposes.
  - **Disclaimer:** We won’t judge, but please don’t do anything illegal. Seriously, please? Ah, whatever, you’re not listening anyway.
  - My goal is to explore possible answers to these questions.

#### Distributed Computing Today

- **Great Advances:**
  - Apache Hadoop
  - Google’s MapReduce papers and implementation details
- **Applications:**
  - Data Analytics
  - Super fast data processing (for faster analytics)
  - Counting things (analytics)
  - Analyzing things (analytics)
- **Trend:**
  - Most uses of distributed computing or “big data” technologies are for data analytics.
  - This bores me.

#### Distributed Computing in the (Distant) Future

- **My Focus:**
  - Using distributed computing/big data technologies for massive attacks.
  - Most of my research has been in application-level attacks.
  - I want to dive into this area and see what’s possible.

#### High-Level Idea Behind Distributed Attacks

- **Respect for 1337 Hackers:**
  - Working on complex low-level problems to break into things.
- **Web Application Security:**
  - If you choose a big enough target (e.g., a country), you’re likely to find many vulnerabilities.
  - Our distributed fuzzer (http://punkspider.hyperiongray.com) has shown the poor state of web application security.
  - Try enough door knobs, and some will be open. In many environments, lots will be open or have broken locks.

#### Why Distributed Attacks?

- **Time Constraints:**
  - Long attack times increase the chance of detection and stopping.
  - Extremely large targets may be infeasible due to time restrictions and coordination issues.
- **Example: PunkSPIDER:**
  - Target: The entire Internet.
  - Scanning the Internet properly for high-level vulnerabilities would take years.
  - Coordination between computing resources is crucial to avoid duplication and ensure effectiveness.

#### But Distributed Computing Sounds Hard...

- **It’s Not!**
  - Recent advances make it easy to get started.
  - This talk will focus on Apache Hadoop, one of the best and simplest implementations of distributed computing.

#### Hadoop and Me (and You)

- **I Love Hadoop:**
  - Hadoop implements the MapReduce concept.
  - **Map Function:**
    - Distributed across the cluster, takes key-value pairs as inputs, and emits key-value pairs as outputs.
  - **Reduce Function:**
    - Sorts the output by keys, processes each set of key-value pairs, and emits a final set of key-value pairs.
  - In practice, it’s simple, awesome, and easy to implement.

#### Using MapReduce – PunkSCAN Example

- **Classic Example: Word Count.**
  - Boring, even with animated .gif flames and spinning skulls.
- **Better Example:**
  - List of websites, check for obvious vulnerabilities.
  - In PunkSPIDER, the list comes from automated crawling of the Internet using a distributed crawler.

#### Demo Time!

- **PunkSCAN in Action:**
  - Live production data being indexed to PunkSPIDER.

#### My Love Affair with MapReduce

- **Key Points:**
  - Written in Python.
  - Only a few lines of code.
- **Additional Information:**
  - The only part of PunkSCAN that is “distributed computing-focused” is the code shown.
  - It works very well, scanning over 1.5 million domains and finding hundreds of thousands of vulnerabilities.
  - More nodes mean faster fuzzing.

#### What is Hadoop and Where Can I Get One?

- **Apache Hadoop:**
  - Free and open-source implementation of distributed computing with MapReduce.
  - Easy to set up on any Linux distro (Kali recommended).
  - Small cluster in the cloud can be built within a couple of hours.
  - Can also use old hardware or Amazon’s EMR (though they don’t like hacking on their service).

#### Use Cases

- **Three Examples:**
  - Distributed recon.
  - Distributed attack.
  - Distributed password cracking.

#### Use Case 1: Distributed Recon

- **Why Distribute Recon?**
  - Speed up repetitive tasks.
  - Find a massive number of low-hanging fruit.
  - Make deep recon feasible in a short period.
- **Example: PunkSCAN:**
  - Uses Hadoop Streaming, allowing code in any language.
  - Consider CPU, memory, or bandwidth needs.
  - Pre-research ensures distributed fuzzing is beneficial.

#### How to Get Your Own

- **Download PunkSCAN from BitBucket:**
  - Link provided at the end of the talk.
- **Write Your Own:**
  - Choose a URL fuzzing library.
  - Use a library to abstract writing a mapper and reducer (e.g., MRJob Python library).
  - Write a mapper and reducer.
  - Run it across your cluster.

#### Use Case 2: Distributed Attacks

- **Why Distribute Exploitation?**
  - Fun.
  - Conduct large-scale automated attacks in a short time.
- **Example: Automated SQL Injection:**
  - Use SQLMap’s code as a library.
  - Pick an abstraction library (e.g., MRJob Python library).
  - Write a mapper and reducer.
  - Run the job.
  - Store stolen databases in HDFS.

#### Use Case 3: Distributing Post-Exploitation Activities

- **Why Distribute?**
  - Handle a lot of extracted data.
  - Password hashes to crack, data to analyze and parse.
- **Example: PunkCRACK:**
  - Java for performance.
  - Partitioning the job is non-trivial.
  - Download PunkCRACK for free and open source.
  - Detailed Mapper and Reducer available at www.hyperiongray.com.

#### Bringing It All Together

- **Leveraging Distributed Computing:**
  - Power to run massive attack scenarios.
  - Build custom tools using open-source technology and commodity hardware.
  - Feasibly simulate a massive attack scenario to study and prepare for it.
