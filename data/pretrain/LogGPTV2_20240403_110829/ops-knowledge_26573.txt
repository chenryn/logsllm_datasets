User: I installed Anaconda a while ago but recently decided to uninstall it and just install basic python 2.7.
I removed Anaconda and deleted all the directories and installed python 2.7.
But when I go to install PyGTK for Windows it says it will install it to the c:/users/.../Anaconda directory - this doesn't even exist. I want to install it to the c:/python-2.7 directory. Why does it think Anaconda is still installed? And how can I change this?
Assistant: It looks that some files are still left and some registry keys are left. So you can run revocleaner tool to remove those entries as well. Do a reboot and install again it should be doing it now.
I also faced issue and by complete cleaning I got Rid of it.
