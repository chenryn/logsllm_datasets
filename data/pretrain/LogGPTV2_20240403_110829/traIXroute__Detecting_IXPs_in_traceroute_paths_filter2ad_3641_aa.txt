Abstract. Internet eXchange Points (IXP) are critical components of
the Internet infrastructure that aﬀect its performance, evolution, secu-
rity and economics. In this work, we introduce techniques to augment
the well-known traceroute tool with the capability of identifying if
and where exactly IXPs are crossed in end-to-end paths. Knowing this
information can help end-users have more transparency over how their
traﬃc ﬂows in the Internet. Our tool, called traIXroute, exploits data
from the PeeringDB (PDB) and the Packet Clearing House (PCH) about
IXP IP addresses of BGP routers, IXP members, and IXP preﬁxes. We
show that the used data are both rich, i.e., we ﬁnd 12,716 IP addresses
of BGP routers in 460 IXPs, and mostly accurate, i.e., our validation
shows 92–93 % accuracy. In addition, 78.2 % of the detected IXPs in
our data are based on multiple diverse evidence and therefore help have
higher conﬁdence on the detected IXPs than when relying solely on IXP
preﬁxes. To demonstrate the utility of our tool, we use it to show that
one out of ﬁve paths in our data cross an IXP and that paths do not
normally cross more than a single IXP, as it is expected based on the
valley-free model about Internet policies. Furthermore, although the top
IXPs both in terms of paths and members are located in Europe, US
IXPs attract many more paths than their number of members indicates.
1 Introduction
A few hundred IXPs worldwide host more than one hundred thousand
interconnections between Autonomous Systems (ASes) [10,14,20]. As critical
components of the Internet infrastructure, IXPs inﬂuence its expansion [16],
performance [11], and security [7]. However, their centralized nature is also a
limitation that can be exploited for mass surveillance of Internet users or for
targeted attacks. Although IXPs exist since the early days of the Internet, they
have recently attracted intense interest from the academic community in part
because the last decade the Internet topology is ﬂattening [16,18,21,23], which
implies an even more central role for IXPs.
In this work we extend the well-known and widely-used traceroute tool with
the capability of inferring if and where an IXP was crossed. This is useful not
only for end-users in having more transparency over where their traﬃc goes,
but also for operators in troubleshooting end-to-end paths and for researchers

in understanding the evolving IXP ecosystem. Our tool, called traIXroute,
detects IXPs based on data from the PeeringDB (PDB) and the Packet Clearing
House (PCH). In particular, it uses the (i) exact IP addresses of BGP routers
connected to IXP subnets; (ii) IXP member ASes; (iii) IXP preﬁxes; and (iv) IP
addresses to AS mappings; and combines multiple information to detect IXPs
with higher conﬁdence than simply relying on IXP preﬁxes.
Our second contribution is that we evaluate the coverage and accuracy of the
IXP router IP addresses, which we denote with a triplet {IP address −→ IXP,
AS}, in PDB and PCH. We ﬁnd in total 12,716 triplets for 460 IXPs worldwide.
Using the exact router IXP addresses along with checking the IXP membership
of the two adjacent ASes, we classify 78.2 % of the IXP paths. Therefore, in most
cases we can detect an IXP with strong evidence. In addition, we ﬁnd that 92–
93 % of the triplets {IP address −→ IXP, AS} extracted from PDB and PCH are
consistent with the corresponding information extracted from live BGP sessions
of route collectors at IXPs.
Third, to illustrate how traIXroute can be useful,
in particular for
researchers in Internet measurement studies, we use it to answer the following
questions: (i) how often paths cross IXPs? (ii) which IXPs attract most paths?
and (iii) how many IXPs are encountered per path? We apply traIXroute on
31.8 million traceroute probes collected from the ark measurement infrastruc-
ture [1]. We ﬁnd that approximately one out of ﬁve paths crossed an IXP and
that IXP-paths normally cross no more than a single IXP. The IXP hop is located
on average near the 6th hop at the middle of the route. Finally, we show that
the top IXPs in terms of paths diﬀer in part from the top IXPs in terms of AS
members.
The rest of this paper is structured as follows. In the next section, we discuss
the related work and provide background into the problem of detecting IXPs in
traceroute paths. Next, in Sect. 3 we describe traIXroute and its IXP detection
techniques. In Sect. 4, we evaluate the coverage and accuracy of the data used
by traIXroute and discuss the hit rate of its detection rules. Finally, in Sect. 5
we outline our IXP measurement study using traIXroute and in Sect. 6 we
conclude.
2 Related Work and Background
Previous studies have examined the problem of mapping traceroute paths to
AS-level paths [15,25]. Mapping IP addresses to ASes is not straightforward
because routers can reply with source IP addresses numbered from a third-party
AS. These studies ignore hops with IXP IP addresses. These addresses are used
to number BGP router interfaces connected to the IXP subnet and it is hard to
identify to which AS they belong.
Besides, a group of previous studies, starting with Xu et al. [27] and then
followed by He et al. [22] and Augustin et al. [13], focus on inferring participating
ASes and peerings at IXPs from targeted traceroute measurements. Compared
to these studies, our goal is diﬀerent: we build a general-purpose traceroute

tool, while they aim at discovering as many peering links as possible. The basic
methodology developed in [27] and then signiﬁcantly extended in [13,22] detects
IXPs based on assigned IP address preﬁxes and uses various heuristics to infer
peering ASes. The seminal work of Augustin et al. [13] exploited also data for
BGP routers at IXP, but by querying 1.1K BGP Looking Glass servers, which
had signiﬁcant processing cost. In contrast, we extract corresponding data from
PDB and PCH, with low processing cost, and show that they are both rich and
mostly accurate.
Recently, Giotsas et al. [19] introduced techniques to identify the physical
facility where ASes interconnect using targeted traceroute measurements and a
combination of publicly available facility and IXP based information.
Our starting point in this work is that observing an IP address from
an IXP preﬁx is not suﬃcient evidence to conclude that the IXP was
crossed. This happens for multiple reasons: (i) the available IXP IP address
preﬁx data may be inaccurate; (ii) IXPs could use allocated addresses not only
in the IXP subnet but also in other operational subnets; and (iii) third-party
IP addresses from IXP subnets. To illustrate the latter consider the following
example (cf. Fig. 1). A router connected to the IXP fabric could reply to tracer-
oute probes using a source IP address from any of its interfaces, including the
interface on the IXP subnet. Traceroute paths that do not cross the IXP, like
the dotted one in Fig. 1, can include a reply with a source IP address from the
IXP subnet. Therefore, the path appears to have an IP address from an IXP
subnet, even if the IXP is not crossed. Our goal is to detect paths that cross the
IXP fabric, like the dashed one in Fig. 1.

a reply with an IXP IP address, even if the IXP is not crossed. Our goal is to identify
paths that cross the IXP, like the dashed one.
To be more conﬁdent that an IXP is crossed, we exploit speciﬁc information
about the IP addresses of BGP router interfaces connected to the IXP subnet.
This data enable us also to associate IP addresses to ASes and IXPs. Further-
more, we check if the ASes before and after the IXP IP address are members

of the candidate IXP based on the IXP membership data from PCH and PDB,
which have not been explored in the previous studies for this purpose.
3 traIXroute Design and Heuristics
In this section, we ﬁrst outline the design of traIXroute and then its IXP
detection heuristics.
3.1 traIXroute Design
traIXroute is written in python and operates like traceroute. It can be
conﬁgured to use either the standard traceroute tool in the background or
the scamper tool [24], which implements the Paris traceroute technique [12].
It has a modular design and can be easily extended with new IXP data and
detection rules. An example of the output of traIXroute is shown in Fig. 2.
In this example the Vienna IX is detected between hops 5 and 6. The tool also
prints the AS that corresponds to each hop based on simple origin AS lookups.
traIXroute exploits three datasets to identify IXPs in traceroute paths which
can be updated automatically from the command line:
1. IXP Memberships Dataset: We use IXP membership data from the
PeeringDB (PDB) [4] and the Packet Clearing House (PCH) [3]. They
provide: (1) exact IP addresses of router interfaces connected to the IXP
network; and (2) the ASes which these routers belong to. Therefore, this
dataset provides an association from IXP IP addresses to ASes and IXPs,
i.e., a triplet of the form {IP address −→ IXP, AS}, which we mainly exploit
in our heuristics.
2. IXP IP Address Preﬁxes Dataset: We use, in addition, two datasets
of IPv4 address preﬁxes assigned to IXPs. The ﬁrst is provided by PDB,
while we extract the second from PCH. These addresses are typically used to
number the interfaces of the BGP routers connected to the IXP subnet. We
organize the dataset in the form {IP preﬁx −→ IXP} to map IP addresses
to IXPs.

3. Routeviews Preﬁx to AS mappings Dataset: We use IP address preﬁx
to AS mappings, i.e., {IP preﬁx −→ AS}, provided by CAIDA [5] based on
data from RouteViews [9], to associate IP addresses to ASes. Also, we ﬁlter
the IANA reserved IP addresses, which should not be announced to BGP,
to protect from route leaks and other misconﬁgurations. When encounter-
ing multi-origin-as [28] IP addresses, we check the IXP membership of all
the ASes.
PCH and PDB do not use consistent identiﬁers for IXPs and therefore if one
naively matched the IXP identiﬁers would introduce artifacts. For this reason, we
merge the two datasets by matching the IXP IP addresses, preﬁxes and names.
We ignore matched records that include inconsistent attributes. In addition, we
ﬁlter data for IXPs marked as inactive.
3.2
IXP Detection
Next, we describe our methodology to detect and identify at which hop we cross
an IXP in traceroute paths. When observing an IP address from an IXP subnet,
we ask what information we know, based on our data, for this and the adjacent
IP addresses. In particular, to infer an IXP crossing we follow three steps:
(Step 1) - Does the IP Address Match an Exact BGP Router IP
Address from an IXP Subnet? In this case, we have a speciﬁc triplet {IP
address −→ IXP, AS}, which gives us also additional information about the
AS of the router on the IXP. If an exact router IP address is not matched,
then we check if an IXP preﬁx is matched, like in previous works [13,22]. How-
ever, in this case we do not have any information about the AS that owns
the router. If an IP address in the k-th hop of a traceroute path IPk belongs
to the interface of a router connected to the IXP subnet, then we denote this
inf−−→ IXP, ASk, where IXP is the IXP and ASk the AS of the router.
with IPk
Otherwise, if we can associate IPk only with an IXP IP preﬁx, then we denote
this with IPk
(Step 2) - Are the Adjacent ASes Members of the IXP? We map the IP
addresses 1-hop adjacent to the observed IXP IP address to ASes and, consider-
ing also the AS of the IXP IP address (if this information is available), we check
the IXP membership of the ASes. We distinguish four possible cases: (i) both
ASes are members, (ii)-(iii) only the AS in the left or right of the IXP IP address
is a member; and (iv) none of the ASes is an IXP member. Our assessment is
based on the available data about the ASes from triplets and from mapping IP
addresses to ASes using the Routeviews Preﬁx to AS mappings Dataset. Such
mappings could be wrong [25], therefore we do not consider this evidence alone
