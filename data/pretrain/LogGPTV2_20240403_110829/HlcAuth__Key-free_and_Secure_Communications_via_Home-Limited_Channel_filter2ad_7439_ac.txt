### Infrared Receiver and Associated Components

The system employs an infrared receiver, a KY-008 650nm red MVL transmitter, a GY-485-44009 RS485 light intensity sensor, and an HC-SR04 ultrasound transducer. To ensure that the Home-Limited Channel (HLC) signals cover the entire room, the gateway is equipped with two sets of HLC sensors on both sides. The experimental setup was deployed in a room measuring 3m x 2.5m x 3m, as shown in Figure 4.

### Attacker Positions

We assume that attackers can position themselves at any location outside the house. For the experiments, we selected four specific positions:
1. Behind a 6cm thick metal door.
2. Behind a 30cm thick wall.
3. Behind a 3cm covered window.
4. Behind a 3cm glass window.

### Evaluation Metrics

To quantify usability, we use the True Positive Rate (TPR). TPR is defined as the number of legal commands that are correctly executed (TP), divided by the sum of TP and the number of commands that the device fails to execute as expected (FN).

\[ \text{TPR} = \frac{\text{TP}}{\text{TP} + \text{FN}} \]

To measure security, we use the False Positive Rate (FPR). FPR is defined as the number of forged commands from the attacker that are executed (FP), divided by the sum of FP and the number of forged commands that are successfully rejected (TN).

\[ \text{FPR} = \frac{\text{FP}}{\text{FP} + \text{TN}} \]

### Experimental Results

Figure 5 illustrates the TPR of infrared, ultrasound, and MVL-based HLC at various distances. Both infrared and MVL achieve a TPR of 100% within 4.2 meters and 96% at 5 meters. In contrast, ultrasound achieves a TPR of 100% only between 0.6 meters and 2.6 meters.

### Security Against External Attackers

We simulated a malicious gateway mimicking a local outside attacker positioned as close as possible to the smart home. We then moved the indoor victim from 0 meters to 3 meters away from the boundary in 10cm increments, calculating the FPR at each step.

The results show that the FPR is 0 when using infrared, ultrasound, or MVL signals to build HlcAuth. This indicates that attackers cannot reliably send or receive packets when located outside the boundary of the smart home. Although high-power infrared and MVL signals have a small chance of penetrating a glass window, attackers still fail to conduct successful attacks due to the constrained timing. The constrained timing means that the attacker must complete the transmission of the entire response message before the user’s gateway begins to send the legal response message. Since the infrared receiver cannot demodulate successfully when two infrared messages collide, the attack fails. Tests show that the transmission duration of a response message is approximately 325ms to 350ms, which is much longer than the 27ms processing time for the challenge message.

### Related Work

#### Smart Home Security

Current smart home security efforts focus on smart devices and communication protocols. Denning et al. [2] outlined emergent threats to smart homes due to the vulnerability of smart devices. Notra et al. [15] dissected the behavior of three household devices, showing that these devices can be compromised. Molina [13] exploited KNX package flaws to remotely control a home automation (HA) system.

To improve the security of communication in smart home systems, existing work focuses on lightweight authentication schemes. Kumar et al. [8] used a short authentication token and established a secure session key to reduce the cost of public key operations. However, their scheme requires a third-party service provider and pre-stored secure information. Li et al. [10] proposed that each node obtain a private/public key pair from a certificate authority (CA) over an out-of-band (OOB) channel, followed by an authenticated key exchange protocol. However, this work lacks implementation details and security analysis for OOB data distribution. Our proposed HlcAuth is a secure, lightweight communication protocol based on home-limited channels with minimal additional cost.

#### Out-of-Band (OOB) Channels

OOB channels are typically used for device pairing during the bootstrap phase. These channels can be categorized based on the physical medium, such as acoustic [4], light [16], seismic, magnetic, thermal, and movement [12]. Traditional OOB channel-based pairing methods are generally considered secure. However, Halevi et al. [6] demonstrated the feasibility of eavesdropping on acoustic OOB channels. In our protocol design, we utilize the home limitation of OOB channels to establish a secure communication protocol against local outside attacks from both RF and OOB channels.

### Conclusion

We studied the Home-Limited Channel (HLC) to enhance the security of existing smart homes through HlcAuth. Based on the boundary-attenuated property of HLCs, HlcAuth uses a challenge-response mechanism to achieve mutual authentication between the gateway and smart devices without key management. Security analysis revealed that HlcAuth can defend against replay attacks, message-forgery attacks, and man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attacks. Our validation showed that HlcAuth provides high usability (e.g., 100% TPR within 4.2 meters, low time and energy consumption, and low cost) while being resilient against various attacks conducted by local outside attackers. Future work will focus on studying the impact of house boundaries, such as the thickness and materials of walls.
