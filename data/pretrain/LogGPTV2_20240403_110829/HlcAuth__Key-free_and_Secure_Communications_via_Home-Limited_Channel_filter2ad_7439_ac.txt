infrared receiver, a KY-008 650nm red MVL transmitter, a GY-485-
44009 RS485 light intensity sensor, and an HC-SR04 ultrasound
transducer. To guarantee the HLC signals can cover the whole
room, the gateway is equipped with two sets of HLC sensors on its
both sides. We also deploy our prototype in a 3m ∗ 2.5m ∗ 3m room.
The experiment setup is shown in Fig. 4.
We assume that attackers can locate at any position outside the
house. We select four positions in the experiments: an attacker
stays behind 1) a 6cm thick metal door, 2) a 30cm wall, 3) a 3cm
covered window, and 4) a 3cm glass window, respectively.
Evaluation Metrics. To quantify usability, true positive rate (TPR)
is used. TP denotes the number of legal commands that are correctly
executed, while FN represents the number of commands that the
device doesn’t execute as expected. We utilize false positive rate
(FPR) to quantify security. FP denotes the number of the forged
commands from the attacker that are executed, while TN denotes
the number of forged commands being rejected successfully.

Figure 5: The TPR of infrared, ultrasound, and MVL-based
HLC at various distances. Both infrared and MVL can
achieve a TPR of 100% within 4.2m and 96% at 5m while ul-
trasound can only achieve a TPR of 100% between 0.6m to
2.6m.

who tries to stay as close as possible to the smart home. Then we
move the indoor victim from 0m to 3m away from the boundary at
a 10cm step and calculate FPR.
The results show that the FPR is 0 when using infrared, ultra-
sound or MVL signals to build HlcAuth. Thus, attackers cannot
successfully send or receive packets reliably when locating outside
the boundary of the smart home. Although the high-power infrared
and MVL signals can have small chance to penetrate glass window,
attackers still fail to conduct various attacks due to the constrained
timing. The constrained timing means that when the attacker have
received the challenge message, she must finish the transmission
of the entire response message before the user’s gateway begins to
send the legal response message. Since the infrared receiver cannot
demodulate successfully when two infrared messages collide, the
attack fails. Tests show that the transmission duration of a response
message is around 325ms to 350ms, which is much longer than the
27ms processing time of the challenge message.

7 RELATED WORK
Smart Home Security. Current smart home security focus on
smart devices and communication protocols. First, Denning et al.
outlined a set of emergent threats to smart homes due to the vulner-
ability of the smart devices [2]. Notra et al. [15] dissect the behavior
of three household devices, and the results show that these devices
can be compromised. The communication protocols applied in the
smart home was also found insecure. Molina [13] utilized the KNX
package flaws to realize the remote control on a HA system.
To improve the security of the communication in smart home
systems, existing work focuses on building up a lightweight au-
thentication scheme between smart home devices. Kumar et al. [8]
used a short authentication token and established a secure session
key to reduce the cost of the public key operations. However, the
system setup in this scheme requires a third-party service provider
involvement, and the secure information that used to produce a
session key has to be stored in home devices in advance. Li et
al. [10] proposed that each node get private/public key pair from
a certificate agent(CA) over an OOB channel and then carry out
an authenticated key exchange protocol. However, this work does
not include the implementation and no security analysis on OOB
data distribution provided. Different from the above schemes, we
propose a secure lightweight communication protocol based on
home-limited channel with minimal additional cost.
OOB Channel. Typically, Out-of-band (OOB) Channels are used
for device pairing [4, 12, 16] at bootstrap phase. According to the
physical channel that signals communicate over, OOB channels
can be categorized into acoustic [4], light [16], seismic, magnetic,
thermal, and movement [12]. Traditional device pairing methods
based on OOB channels are generally considered as secure. How-
ever, Halevi et al. [6] demonstrate the feasibility of eavesdropping
acoustic OOB channels, which should be taken into account in our
protocol design. In this paper, we utilize the home limitation of
OOB channels to establish a secure communication protocol against
local outside attacks from both RF and OOB channels.
8 CONCLUSION
We studied Home-Limited Channel (HLC) that can enhance the
security of existing smart home– HlcAuth. Based on the boundary-
attenuated property of HLCs, HlcAuth utilized challenge-response
mechanism to realize the mutual authentication between the gate-
way and smart devices without key management. The security anal-
ysis revealed that the HlcAuth can defend against replay attacks,
message-forgery attacks, and man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attacks.
Our validation showed that HlcAuth can satisfy the usability (e.g.,
100% TPR within 4.2m, low time and energy consumption, and low
cost) for the in-home devices while being resilient against various
attacks conducted by local outside attackers. As a direction for
future work, it is worth studying the impact of house boundaries,
e.g., the thickness and materials of the walls.
