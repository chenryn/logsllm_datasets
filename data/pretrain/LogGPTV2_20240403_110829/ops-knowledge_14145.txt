**Question: How to Use a Multi-SAN Certificate on Both Lync and Exchange Servers?**

I have a Multi-SAN certificate issued by GoDaddy, which includes four Subject Alternative Names (SANs). To use this certificate in an Exchange environment, I added the external and internal hostnames of my Exchange server as SANs. This configuration allows both internal and external Outlook Web Access (OWA) users to access the server without encountering certificate errors.

Recently, I added a Lync server to the environment and installed the same Multi-SAN certificate on that machine, intending to use one of the other SAN names for the Lync service. While Lync users can connect without issues, OWA integration fails, displaying the error message: "Instant Messaging is not available right now."

I suspect that using the same certificate on both the OWA and Lync servers, even though they reference different SANs, might be causing the problem. 

**Any suggestions?**

**Response:**

Using the same Multi-SAN certificate across multiple applications, such as Lync and Exchange, is generally not a problem. The issue likely lies in a misconfiguration on the Lync side rather than with the certificate itself.

To troubleshoot, you should verify the following:

1. **Lync URLs:** Ensure that all URLs used by Lync (e.g., SIP, Autodiscover, Meet, Dialin, etc.) are correctly configured and that the certificate contains all the necessary names.
2. **DNS Configuration:** Verify that DNS records are correctly set up and resolve to the appropriate IP addresses.
3. **Firewall Settings:** Check that firewalls are not blocking necessary ports or protocols.
4. **Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDNs):** Ensure that all FQDNs used by Lync and Exchange are included in the certificate and properly configured.
5. **Updates and Patches:** Make sure that both Lync and Exchange servers are up to date with the latest patches and updates.
6. **Event Logs:** Review the event logs on both the Lync and Exchange servers for any relevant errors or warnings.

There are many potential points of failure when setting up Lync, and the symptoms can range from straightforward to complex. By systematically checking each of these areas, you should be able to identify and resolve the issue.
