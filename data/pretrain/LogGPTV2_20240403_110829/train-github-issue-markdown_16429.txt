I ran a few benchmarks on the server (modifying
https://github.com/paulshen/react-bench to not use jsdom). The results were
surprising, as the browserified `react.js` was about **30% faster** than the
npm version, even with `NODE_ENV=production`.
The performance ranking (test run time) was `react.min.js` < `react.js` <
`NODE_ENV=production node react` < `node react`.
I suspect `process.env` is not a regular js object but perhaps a getter and
thus carries a penalty when you test for `"production" !==
process.env.NODE_ENV` everywhere.
Also the minified version might still perform best of all, as at least some
time ago V8 used function source length (including comments) as a heuristic
for function complexity / compilation time and thus affecting chances for
optimization in some cases, but the effect might be negligible.
