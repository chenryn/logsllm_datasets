I conducted several benchmark tests on the server, modifying the `react-bench` repository (https://github.com/paulshen/react-bench) to exclude the use of jsdom. The results were quite surprising: the browserified version of `react.js` outperformed the npm version by approximately **30%**, even with the `NODE_ENV` set to `production`.

The performance ranking, based on test run times, was as follows:
- `react.min.js` (fastest)
- `react.js`
- `NODE_ENV=production node react`
- `node react` (slowest)

I hypothesize that `process.env` may not be a standard JavaScript object but rather a getter, which could introduce a performance penalty when checking for `process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production"` throughout the code.

Additionally, the minified version (`react.min.js`) might still offer the best performance. Historically, V8, the JavaScript engine used in Google Chrome and Node.js, has used the length of function source code (including comments) as a heuristic for determining function complexity and compilation time. This could influence optimization opportunities, although the impact might be minimal in this case.

Overall, these findings suggest that the choice of React build and environment configuration can significantly affect performance, and further investigation into the specific behaviors of `process.env` and V8 optimizations could provide additional insights.
