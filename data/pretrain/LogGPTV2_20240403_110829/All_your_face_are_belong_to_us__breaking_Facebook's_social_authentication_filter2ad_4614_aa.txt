## Abstract
Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a widely adopted security measure used by high-value services to prevent account compromise through stolen credentials. Facebook has recently introduced a 2FA mechanism known as Social Authentication (SA), which requires users to identify some of their friends in randomly selected photos. A recent study provided a formal analysis of the weaknesses of SA against attackers within the victim's social circles.

In this paper, we extend the threat model and examine the attack surface of SA in practice. We demonstrate how any attacker can obtain the information needed to solve the challenges presented by Facebook. We implement a proof-of-concept system that uses widely available face recognition software and cloud services, and evaluate it using real public data collected from Facebook. Our results show that an attacker can access (sensitive) information for at least 42% of a user’s friends used in generating SA challenges. By relying solely on publicly accessible information, a casual attacker can solve 22% of the SA tests automatically, and gain a significant advantage for an additional 56% of the tests. Additionally, we simulate a scenario where a determined attacker places themselves inside the victim’s social circle using dummy accounts. In this case, the accuracy of our attack increases to 100% when 120 faces per friend are accessible, even though it remains highly accurate with as few as 10 faces.

## 1. Introduction
Online social networks (OSNs) have become some of the fastest-growing web services, with a massive user base and an attractive target for malicious activities. As of March 2012, Facebook reported over 900 million active users, encouraging them to share more information online for a richer experience. This accumulated data and the interconnections between users make OSNs an appealing target for internet miscreants, who harvest account credentials using both technical and social-engineering attacks. Studies have shown that traditional underground economies have shifted their focus from stolen credit card numbers to compromised social network profiles, which are sold at high prices. Recent studies also report that most spamming accounts in OSNs are not dummy profiles but legitimate, existing user accounts that have been compromised. New Facebook phishing attacks use compromised accounts to steal personal information.

To strengthen the security of online user accounts, high-value services such as online banking and Google services have adopted two-factor authentication (2FA). Typically, the two factors consist of something the user knows (e.g., a password) and something the user possesses (e.g., a hardware token). However, physical tokens are inconvenient for users and costly for the service provider.

In 2011, Facebook introduced Social Authentication (SA) as a second authentication factor based on user-related social information. After standard password-based authentication, if Facebook deems it necessary, users are presented with photos of seven of their friends and asked to identify them. SA appears more user-friendly and practical, as users are required to identify photos of people they know and are accustomed to tagging photos of their friends, thus providing the necessary labeled dataset for Facebook.

In this paper, we identify the vulnerabilities of SA and empirically confirm a series of weaknesses that enable an adversary to carry out an effective automated attack against Facebook’s SA. The key to SA is the knowledge a user has about their online social circle, which an attacker with stolen credentials lacks. Facebook acknowledges that its heuristics and threat model do not cover the case of friends and family hacking into one's account. Our research shows that any stranger who obtains a user’s password can gain enough data to defeat the SA mechanism.

We conduct experiments to validate our assumptions about the access an adversary might have to such information. The core of this paper is the design and implementation of an automated, modular system that defeats Facebook’s SA mechanism. During a preparatory reconnaissance phase, we obtain a victim’s list of friends and the photos accessible from their OSN profile. This includes crawling the publicly-accessible portion of the victim’s social graph and (optionally) performing actions that bring us inside the restricted part of the social circle, such as issuing friendship requests to the victim’s friends. We then process the collected photos using face detection and recognition software to build each friend’s facial model. When the SA test is triggered, we look up the identity of the depicted friends and provide an answer.

Our experiments show that 71% of Facebook users expose at least one publicly-accessible photo album, and an attacker has good chances of gaining access to profiles with private photo albums through online friendship requests. Even if a user’s photos are protected, another user might have a photo of them tagged, making the tags implicitly exposed to crawling. Overall, the dynamics of OSNs like Facebook make it difficult for users to control their data, thereby increasing the attack surface of threats against SA. We show that anyone can gain access to crucial information for at least 42% of the tagged friends used to build SA challenges.

Under minimal attack-surface assumptions, our implemented SA breaker, powered by a face recognition module, solves 22% of the real SA tests presented by Facebook (28 out of 127 tests) in less than 60 seconds per test. Moreover, our attack gives a significant advantage to an attacker, solving 70% of each test (5 out of 7 pages) for 56% of the remaining tests (71 out of 99 tests). Our simulations demonstrate that within a maximized attack surface, the success rate of our attack increases to 100% with as little as 120 faces per victim for training, taking about 100 seconds per test.

A recent study provided a formal analysis of the social authentication weaknesses against attackers within the victim’s social circle. We expand the threat model and demonstrate in practice that any attacker, inside and outside the victim’s social circle, can carry out automated attacks against the SA mechanism efficiently. Therefore, we argue that Facebook should reconsider its threat model and re-evaluate this security mechanism.

### Key Contributions
- We systematize and expand previous work, pointing out the feasibility of recognizing people’s faces using Facebook photos and the theoretical issues with face-based SA.
- We present a black-box security analysis of Facebook’s SA mechanism, highlighting its weaknesses and implementation flaws.
- We design and implement an automated, modular system that leverages face detection and recognition to break Facebook’s SA efficiently, demonstrating the feasibility of such an attack at scale.
- We show that publicly-available face recognition services offer a very accessible and precise alternative to building a custom face recognition system.
- We discuss how Facebook’s SA scheme should be modified to ensure users can trust it as a second authentication factor.

## 2. Social Authentication
### 2.1 How Social Authentication Works
After standard password-based authentication, the user is presented with a sequence of seven pages featuring authentication challenges. Each challenge consists of three photos of an online friend; the names of six people from the user’s social circle are listed, and the user must select the one depicted. The user is allowed to fail in two challenges or skip them but must correctly identify the people in at least five to pass the SA test.

### 2.2 Requirements for Triggering
Based on our analysis, Facebook activates SA only for accounts with enough friends and a sufficient number of tagged photos containing human faces.

- **Friend List**: SA requires the user to have a reasonable number of friends. From our experiments, a user must have at least 50 friends to trigger SA.
- **Tagged Photos**: The user’s friends must be tagged in an adequate number of photos. Since these are user-submitted tags, Facebook’s dataset can get easily tainted. People often erroneously tag objects as their friends or publish photos with many friends tagged, several of whom may not actually be present in the photo.
- **Faces**: SA tests must be solvable by humans within the 5-minute time window enforced by Facebook. We argue that Facebook employs a face detection algorithm to filter the dataset of tagged people to select photos with tagged faces. From our manual inspection of 127 instances of real SA tests (2,667 photos), 84% contained at least one human-recognizable face, and about 80% contained at least one face discernible by advanced face detection software. To validate our argument, we repeated the same manual inspection on a different set of 3,486 photos drawn at random from our dataset of 16,141,426 photos. Only 69% of these photos contained at least one recognizable human face, confirming our hypothesis that Facebook employs filtering procedures to ensure each SA test page shows the face of the person in question in at least one photo.
- **Triggering**: Facebook triggers SA when it detects a suspicious login attempt, such as logging in from a different geographical location or using a new device for the first time.

### 2.3 Advantages and Shortcomings
The major difference from traditional 2FA mechanisms (e.g., confirmation codes sent via text message or OTP tokens) is that Facebook’s SA is less cumbersome, especially because users are accustomed to tagging friends in photos. However, designing a usable yet secure SA scheme is challenging in tightly-connected social graphs, such as university networks. Our evaluation suggests that SA carries additional implementation drawbacks. The number of friends can influence the applicability and usability of SA. Users with many friends may find it more difficult to manage and complete the SA process.
