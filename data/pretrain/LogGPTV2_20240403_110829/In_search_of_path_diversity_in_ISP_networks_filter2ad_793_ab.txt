a single node in the topology.
Because the Sprint topology used above was at the PoP level,
we focus here on inter-PoP path diversity in Rocketfuel topologies.
Since PoPs represent physical locations, we group all routers lo-
cated in the same city in the Rocketfuel topologies into a PoP and
consider only links between routers in different PoPs.
We have measured the path diversity for all the topologies de-
scribed in [7]. Based on our results, we divide this set of topologies
into two groups:
low contains topologies with a signiﬁcant per-
centage of pairs of PoPs with only one path between them, and
high contains topologies with a higher level of path diversity. Here
we only present results for one representative topologies of each
group. We select Tiscali, an European ISP, to represent the ﬁrst
group and Sprint to represent the other. To distinguish the Sprint
topology inferred by Rocketfuel from the real Sprint topology, we
call the former Sprintinf and the latter Sprintreal.
For the sake of comparison, we eliminate PoPs in Sprintinf that
are not present in Sprintreal. We also remove non-European PoPs
from the Tiscali topology so that both topologies contain only the
main PoPs of their networks. The resulting Sprintinf topology
has 17 PoPs and the Tiscali topology has 49 PoPs. We compute
path diversity between every pair of PoPs in both topologies.
Figure 2 shows the cumulative distribution function of the num-
ber of link- and PoP-disjoint paths for every pair of PoPs. There is
a large difference between the amount of path diversity in the two
topologies. The Sprintinf topology has at least two PoP-disjoint
paths between all of its PoPs, whereas Tiscali has only one path
between 80% of its PoPs. The difference is more pronounced for
link-disjoint paths. Sprintinf has at least ﬁve link-disjoint paths
between all of its PoPs and Tiscali has less than ﬁve link-disjoint
paths between almost 85% of its PoPs.
One can only compute active path diversity from Rocketfuel-

generated topologies. Hence, the lack of path diversity in the Tis-
cali topology does not mean that a single link or router failure will
necessarily disconnect the network. Most likely, Tiscali has backup
links that can be used in the case of failure or use optical-level pro-
tection mechanisms. But the results do indicate that Sprint has a
more robust network because it has a higher path diversity. Sprint
has also more potential for balancing trafﬁc between PoPs as indi-
cated by the number of link-disjoint paths.
More surprising is the difference between the diversities of the
Sprintinf and Sprintreal topologies3. Because active measure-
ments do not capture all the links in the network, we expected that
the path diversity in the Sprintinf topology would be lower than
that of the Sprintreal topology. More speciﬁcally, we expected
the set of disjoint paths between a pair of PoPs in Sprintinf to be
a subset of the set of disjoint paths (including backup links) found
for the same pair of PoPs in Sprintreal. Comparing Figures 1
and 2, we see that, instead, Sprintinf has higher path diversity.
We discuss this issue in the next section.
4. ACCURACY OF PATH DIVERSITY IN
INFERRED TOPOLOGIES
Topologies generated from active measurements are an approxi-
mation of the real ISP network. There may be actual links that are
not in the generated topology, and there may be links in the gener-
ated topology that do not actually exist. As a metric path diversity
is particularly sensitive to such errors, since each error changes the
path diversity by one for at least one pair of PoPs. This contrasts
with other metrics [8], such as node diameter and average pairwise
shortest path, which are relatively insensitive to a small number of
erroneous links.
4.1 Comparison of Inferred and Real
Topologies
Let LI (i, j) and PI (i, j) be the number of link- and PoP-disjoint
paths, respectively, in Sprintinf for a pair of PoPs (i, j). Let
LR(i, j) and PR(i, j) be the corresponding values for Sprintreal.
We further investigate the discrepancies in path diversity between

imately six months apart, but the Sprint topology did not change
much during that period.

the two topologies by computing the ratios:
RLI (i, j) = LI (i, j)/LR(i, j), and
RPI (i, j) = PI (i, j)/PR(i, j) for every pair of PoPs (i, j).
Figure 3 presents the cumulative distribution of RLI (i, j) and
Figure 4 presents the cumulative distribution of RPI (i, j) for all
pair of PoPs (i, j). When RLI (i, j) or RPI (i, j) is 1, the path di-
versity measured for (i, j) in Sprintinf matches that of Sprintreal.
When RLI (i, j) or RPI (i, j) is greater than 1, Sprintinf overes-
timates path diversity, and when RLI (i, j) or RPI (i, j) is less than
1, Sprintinf underestimates path diversity.
Figure 3 shows that the number of link-disjoint paths in Sprintinf
varies from 1.25 to 4.4 times the number of link-disjoint paths in
Sprintreal. On average, there are 158% more link-disjoint paths
in Sprintinf than in Sprintreal. Sprintinf underestimates path
diversity for 9% of the pairs of PoPs, but, averaged over all pairs of
PoPs, it overestimates by 37%.
An inspection of both topologies shows that there is a consider-
able number of false links in the Rocketfuel topology. There are
two kinds of false links in Sprintinf : links between PoPs that are
not connected in Sprintreal and extra links between PoPs that are
connected. Both kinds of false links explain the higher path di-
versity in the inferred topology. False links between PoPs that are
connected in Sprintreal only increase the number of link-disjoint
paths, whereas false links connecting PoPs that are not connected
in Sprintreal increase both the number of link- and PoP-disjoint
paths.
We discuss the origins of these false links and other limitations
of active measurements techniques for capturing path diversity in
the next section.
Some of the false links are easy to identify as being false. For
example, there are inter-PoP links in Sprintinf connecting an ac-
cess router in one city to a backbone router in another city. Such
links cannot exist in the Sprint network. In fact, in our PoP-level
topologies, all inter-PoP links should be between backbone nodes.
Therefore, we remove all links connected to access nodes from
Sprintinf . We call this new version of the topology Sprintinf -
bb. As another example, in [16], the authors of Rocketfuel present
techniques for inferring IGP weights in ISP networks using the
Rocketfuel topologies. For this follow-up work, they used a modi-
ﬁed version of the Rocketfuel topologies. In this new version that
we call Sprintinf -rev, they eliminated all links for which there
was not a corresponding reverse link.
To quantify the impact of these heuristics on improving the ac-
