User: I'm using celery and django-celery. I have defined a periodic task that I'd like to test. Is it possible to run the periodic task from the shell manually so that I view the console output?
Assistant: I think you'll need to open two shells: one for executing tasks from the Python/Django shell, and one for running celery worker (python manage.py celery worker). And as the previous answer said, you can run tasks using apply() or apply_async()
I've edited the answer so you're not using a deprecated command.
