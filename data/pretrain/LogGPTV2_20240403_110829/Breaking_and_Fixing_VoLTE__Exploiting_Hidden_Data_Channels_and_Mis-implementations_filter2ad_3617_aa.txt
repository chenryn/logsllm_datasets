## Abstract
Long Term Evolution (LTE) is becoming the dominant cellular networking technology, shifting from circuit-switched to packet-switched networks. To support voice calls over LTE, operators have introduced Voice-over-LTE (VoLTE), which significantly changes how voice calls are handled. This shift opens up new attack surfaces that have not been previously explored. This paper presents a systematic security analysis of VoLTE.

Unlike traditional call setups, VoLTE call setup is controlled by the Application Processor (AP) using SIP over IP. A legitimate user with control over the AP can potentially exploit the call setup process to establish a VoLTE channel. Combined with legacy accounting policies (e.g., unlimited voice and separation of data and voice), this leads to several free data channels. In the process of uncovering these free data channels, we identify additional vulnerabilities in early VoLTE implementations, leading to serious exploits such as caller spoofing, over-billing, and denial-of-service attacks. We propose immediate countermeasures and discuss the need for a comprehensive solution to eliminate the root causes at mobile devices, mobile platforms, and the core network.

## 1. Introduction
Due to the increasing demand for data-centric services, mobile network operators are rapidly transitioning to high-speed networks. Long Term Evolution (LTE) has become the dominant cellular network technology, offering higher bandwidth and lower latency. LTE operates through packet-based switching, unlike traditional cellular networks (e.g., 2G or 3G) which rely on circuit-based switching for voice services. To serve voice calls on a packet-switching network, operators have adopted Voice-over-LTE (VoLTE), similar to Voice-over-IP (VoIP).

Mobile network operators are aggressively deploying VoLTE services. By April 2015, 16 operators in 7 countries had commercially launched VoLTE services, and 90 operators in 47 countries were investing in VoLTE deployment. Despite this trend, little research has systematically examined the security issues in VoLTE services, both in terms of end-facing interfaces and cellular infrastructure.

The use of packet-switching in VoLTE introduces a large, unexplored attack surface. Unlike circuit-switching, where signal processing is conducted by a proprietary communication processor (CP), VoLTE-compatible devices perform signal processing in their application processor (AP) using SIP over IP. This exposes VoLTE to well-known IP-based attacks.

Several studies have explored potential attacks and countermeasures in SIP and VoIP services, including breaking authentication, bypassing accounting, man-in-the-middle attacks, and various hacker-induced attacks. Since VoLTE operates on the cellular network, it inherits security issues from both VoIP and the cellular network, such as adversaries interposing the signal processing itself.

In this paper, we present problems in commercially deployed VoLTE services from 5 operators in the United States and Korea. These problems are mainly caused by legacy policies and immature software infrastructure. We demonstrate various attacks that exploit hidden, free data channels, bypass VoLTE’s accounting system, and abuse the VoLTE service (e.g., caller spoofing, overbilling). We propose immediate and potential countermeasures, including deploying Deep Packet Inspection (DPI), strict session management, and fixing cellular gateways. For a long-term solution, we suggest changing the accounting policy and implementing tighter security at mobile devices.

### Contributions
- **First Analysis**: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to analyze the security loopholes of commercially deployed VoLTE services. We identified three previously unknown security issues: hidden data channels, mis-implementation by cellular operators, and fundamental problems in mobile devices.
- **Demonstration of Attacks**: We successfully demonstrated an attack that enables a free data channel and various abuse attacks, including call spoofing and denial-of-service. All bugs and exploits were reported to operators.
- **Countermeasures and Solutions**: We proposed effective, immediate countermeasures and devised a long-term, comprehensive solution to eliminate current security issues in VoLTE services.

## 2. Background

### 2.1 LTE Network Infrastructure
A cellular network consists of two components: the access network and the core network. The access network connects the User Equipment (UE) to a base station (e.g., NodeB in 3G and eNodeB in LTE). The core network handles service-level connections such as voice calls and the Internet. The major difference between 3G and LTE networks is in the core network's data delivery method. 3G separates network domains into packet-switching for the Internet and circuit-switching for phone calls, while LTE operates solely through packet-switching, providing VoLTE for voice calls.

### 2.2 VoLTE Service
VoLTE delivers voice calls over the packet-switching based LTE network, utilizing an IMS network based on SIP. To establish a voice call, a UE follows standard procedures:
1. Connects to the eNodeB.
2. Registers to the Evolved Packet System (EPS), establishing an IP connection.
3. Connects to the IMS network and authenticates.
4. Makes a voice call through SIP signaling.
5. Creates a dedicated bearer for voice traffic.
6. Transfers voice packets through the dedicated bearer.
7. Releases the bearer upon call termination.

Two bearers are used: the default bearer for call signaling and the dedicated bearer for voice traffic. The default bearer has the highest priority, ensuring QoS for voice calls.
