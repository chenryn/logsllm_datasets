## Abstract
Product vendors and vulnerability researchers often work with the same software artifacts but may have conflicting goals. The potential for conflict, combined with the legal instruments available to product vendors (e.g., End User License Agreements (EULAs), Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)), raises concerns about "chilling effects" that may deter researchers from rigorously evaluating product security. While there are well-known examples of legal action against individual researchers, these are inherently anecdotal, and skeptics argue that there is no systematic evidence to support such concerns. This paper aims to address this issue by providing quantitative and empirical data. We first seek explicit permission from a range of product companies to conduct security assessments, characterizing the degree of support for vulnerability research activities and how it varies based on the researcher's nature. Second, we conduct an online sentiment survey of vulnerability researchers to understand their abstract concerns or concrete experiences with legal threats and how these shape their choices.

## 1. Introduction
Software of any complexity invariably contains design flaws or deviations from the designer's intent, which can produce unexpected side effects. While most bugs are benign, some security vulnerabilities allow adversaries to violate key security properties. These vulnerabilities rarely manifest without specific adversarial inputs, making them challenging to find. Development practices like the Microsoft Security Development Lifecycle (SDL) aim to reduce their prevalence, but it is widely understood that all software ships with security vulnerabilities. Modern operational security practice focuses on managing these issues after deployment.

### Discovery of Security Vulnerabilities
Third-party vulnerability researchers, who audit software independently, identify the majority of critical vulnerabilities. These researchers play a crucial role in identifying significant flaws and incentivizing developers to fix them. However, the costs of such discoveries, including labor and brand damage, can create an adversarial relationship between developers and researchers. Under U.S. law, software developers have several legal theories to challenge third-party security research, including violations of EULAs, DMCA, CFAA, and other privacy and intellectual property laws.

### Legal Challenges and Chilling Effects
The DMCA, designed to protect media publishers, has been interpreted to cover software protection mechanisms encountered during security audits. Threats under the DMCA have been documented in high-profile cases, such as the 2000 Princeton researchers' case. Industry groups have resisted efforts to create additional safe harbors for security researchers, leading to claims that the DMCA has a "chilling effect" on security research. Advocates argue that this harms consumers, while opponents claim there is no systematic evidence to support these claims.

### Key Results
Our study reveals two key findings:
1. **Company Response to Permission Requests:** While some product manufacturers embrace third-party vulnerability research and provide explicit or implicit consent, most are reluctant to surrender legal recourse and either refuse to engage or impose significant restrictions. There is a notable difference in the responsiveness to academic versus independent security researchers.
2. **Legal Concerns Among Researchers:** Legal concerns are significant for many vulnerability researchers, with almost a quarter reporting having experienced legal threats or actions during their research.

## 2. Study Methodology

### 2.1 Researcher Selection
We hypothesized that the reputation and affiliation of the researcher might influence a company's willingness to grant permission. We approached four security-vulnerability experts: two academics and two independent researchers. Academic researchers benefit from institutional support and public mission, while independent researchers may be more vulnerable to legal threats. Our group included one senior and one junior academic, and two independent researchers, one based in the U.S. and another in the E.U.

### 2.2 Company Selection
We focused on the consumer electronics and software industry, as these companies are likely to have established procedures for handling security vulnerability reports. We excluded non-profits and primarily enterprise-focused companies. Using five sources—Fortune 1000, large retailers, stock indices, press lists, and Y Combinator—we identified approximately 120 companies. Our final sample includes companies with diverse revenues, ranging from $250 thousand to $250 billion, to represent a wide range of products and policies.

### 2.3 Product-Selection Protocol
We used a multi-step approach to select companies and products. We compiled a list of companies from various sources, ensuring a mix of large, mid-sized, and early-stage firms. This diversity was intended to capture a broad spectrum of vulnerability-related policies and experiences.

## 3. Data and Analysis
The remainder of the paper presents the methodology, data, and analysis for both our measurement instruments. We discuss the implications of our findings and provide insights into the current state of legal risks faced by vulnerability researchers.
