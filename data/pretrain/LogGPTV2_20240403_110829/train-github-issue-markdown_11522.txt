I see the following error after choosing to restart VSCode after prompting to
install the update.
> The setup files are corrupted. Please obtain a new copy of the program.

I've attempted to uninstall and reinstall VSCode but that hasn't seemed to
help at all. I still get the same attempted update behavior.
