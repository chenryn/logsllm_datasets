It would be great if VS Code supported the paradigm of semantic highlighting.  
In short, it makes syntax highlighting more useful, by varying the colors of
the same syntax-types of different names in a given scope. This makes it
easier to catch mistakes and to see the flow of variables (since every
variable in a given scope has a unique color, yet based of the same color
range).  
Here's an in depth explanation of what is is with some examples:
