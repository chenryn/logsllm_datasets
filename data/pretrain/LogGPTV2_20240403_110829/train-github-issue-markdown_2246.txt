**Current behavior**  
In our project we use system js in order to create our application bundles.
Because we split our project into several applications, we build one bundle
for all common services and components (lib.bundle.js) and one bundle per app
(app.bundle.js) which does not include what is already available in
lib.bundle.js. We are using https://github.com/systemjs/builder (Version
0.15.35) to build the bundles.
Further we are using baseUrl and paths in tsconfig in order to be able to
import our core files with an absolute import path. Example:  
tsconfig:
        "baseUrl": "./",
        "paths": {
          "@our-lib/*": [
            "src/our-lib/*"
          ]
When transpiling without AoT, the import statements remain absolute and we are
able to configure SystemJS (0.19.42) in order to load the file from the
lib.bundle.js
Now we want to use AoT. ngc runs successfully and we can bundle the files by
using index-aot.ts (bootstraps the module factory) instead of index.ts.
We can't find a way to configure SystemJS in order to locate the modules in
our lib.bundle.js. We see that ngc replaces the absolute import by a relative
import although it uses the same baseUrl/paths configuration.
**Expected behavior**  
ngc should produce absolute imports if there is a path mapping in tsconfig or
we need a way to map relative imports to absolute imports in system js config.
**Minimal reproduction of the problem with instructions**
**What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**  
Use AoT in a complex project which uses system js / system js builder and
later on lazy loading.
**Please tell us about your environment:**
  * **Angular version:** 4.0.0-rc.3
  * **Browser:** Chrome
  * **Language:** TypeScript 2.1.6
  * **Node (for AoT issues):** `node --version` = v6.10.0
