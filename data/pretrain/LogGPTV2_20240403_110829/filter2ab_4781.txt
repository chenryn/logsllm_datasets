titleblackhat:asia-19 Decisions and Revisions - The Ever Evolving Face of the Black Hat NOC
This session is your chance to get up close and personal with the Black Hat NOC. We'll walk you through the process of deciding what equipment and services we deploy on the Black Hat network, and our reasoning around those decisions. We'll also discuss the changes we make when deploying and securing a network in the U.S., Europe, and Asia, and will share some of the behavioral differences we see in the attendees of those shows, both good and bad. And of course, there will be stories and stats! We'll provide a full debrief of the activity we experienced this year, what has changed since past shows, and what that means for our industry as whole.
