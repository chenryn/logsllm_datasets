**ATT&CK ID:** T1090.002  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** External Proxy

Adversaries may employ an external proxy to act as an intermediary for network communications with a command and control (C2) server, thereby avoiding direct connections to their infrastructure. This technique helps to obfuscate the origin and destination of the traffic, making it more difficult for defenders to detect and trace malicious activity.

Several tools are available that enable traffic redirection through proxies or port redirection, such as HTRAN, ZXProxy, and ZXPortMap. Adversaries use these types of proxies to manage C2 communications, provide resiliency in the event of connection loss, and leverage existing trusted communication paths to evade suspicion. By routing traffic through an external proxy, adversaries can maintain persistent and stealthy control over compromised systems.
