title:blackhat:asia-22 A False Door: Crack the Bluetooth Digital Vehicle Key
In an era of intelligent vehicles, smartphones have gradually become the main carrier of vehicle keys, making people's lives more convenient. At present, digital vehicle keys mainly include Bluetooth and NFC keys, and the advantages of Bluetooth keys are more obvious. The Bluetooth PKE (Passive Keyless Enter) provides users with a more convenient experience. As long as users get close to the vehicle, they can unlock the door and start the engine automatically. These functions are applied by many new energy automakers. But, what is the security of these functions?In this talk, we will focus on the remote attack surface of Bluetooth digital key and PKE, and introduce the security solutions provided by some established Tier1 suppliers in the industry. At the same time, we will share the solutions of some famous automakers in the industry. Each solution has its security design highlights, but it is not invincible. We found some security problems of various solutions by using several general attack methods. We will demonstrate practical attack videos in which we successfully unlock the car and drive away with very cheap equipment.Finally, we will put forward our thoughts and suggestions on defending the current Bluetooth digital key attack, and introduce the development trend and future research of digital vehicle keys.
