### Title: BlackHat Asia 2022 - A False Door: Cracking the Bluetooth Digital Vehicle Key

In the era of intelligent vehicles, smartphones have become the primary medium for vehicle keys, enhancing convenience in our daily lives. Currently, digital vehicle keys primarily utilize Bluetooth and NFC technologies, with Bluetooth keys offering more pronounced advantages. The Bluetooth Passive Keyless Entry (PKE) system provides users with a seamless experience, allowing them to unlock their vehicles and start the engine simply by approaching the car. This functionality is widely adopted by many new energy automakers.

However, what about the security of these systems? In this presentation, we will delve into the remote attack surface of Bluetooth digital keys and PKE systems. We will also discuss the security solutions provided by leading Tier 1 suppliers in the automotive industry and share insights from some of the most renowned automakers. Each solution has its unique security design features, but none are entirely impervious to vulnerabilities. Using several common attack methods, we have identified various security issues in these solutions. We will demonstrate practical attack scenarios through videos, showing how we successfully unlocked and drove away with vehicles using inexpensive equipment.

Finally, we will present our thoughts and recommendations on defending against current Bluetooth digital key attacks. Additionally, we will explore the development trends and future research directions for digital vehicle keys.
