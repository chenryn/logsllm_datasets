*Electron version: 1.3.4
Operating System (Platform and Version): OSX 10.13.5  
Expected behavior  
We have a system that we connect into that starts off with a microsoft login.
It then redirects to a VPN login popup that uses NTLM authentication. The page
should show a popup to enter the credentials and allow the ability to send the
NTLM creds to the redirected page.
Actual behavior  
In electron I get the microsoft login but then get a blank page for the
redirect for the NTLM popup.  
I see a 401 unauthorized on the redirect call.
Electron shows blank page where as in chrome you get a popup for credentials.
Also, there is no way to send the NTLM cred to the redirected page.
I was able to successfully log in from Postman using the redirect link and
sending the user name and password in NTLM format.
