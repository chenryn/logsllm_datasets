### Follow-Up on Discourse Post

According to @stevengj, this issue might be resolved by addressing the related Yggdrasil issue.

I am encountering an unusual error when using Julia 1.7.0 on my 2017 MacBook Pro (Intel i7) with macOS 12.0.1. Specifically, when executing the following code:

```julia
n = 1000
A = randn(Float32, n, n)
inv(A)
```

I receive the following error:

```
ERROR: StackOverflowError:
```

with no further stack trace printed.

- The same error occurs with `ComplexF32` and `ComplexF64` types, but not with `Float64`.
- According to @carstenbauer, this issue is also present in versions 1.6.4, 1.7.0.rc-2, 1.7.0.rc-3, and 1.7.0.
- Versions 1.6.3 and the current master branch do not exhibit this issue.

### Additional Details

On my machine, the `inv` function works for all element types up to a certain matrix size. For `Float32`, the failure occurs at a matrix size of 514x514, and for complex types (`ComplexF32` and `ComplexF64`), the failure occurs at a matrix size of 258x258. Below these cutoff sizes, everything works as expected.
