I am running into an odd error when using Julia 1.7.0 on my 2017 Mac Book Pro
(Intel i7) on Mac OS 12.01. In particular, executing
    n = 1000;
    A = randn(Float32, n, n);
    inv(A)
       ERROR: StackOverflowError:
With no further stack trace printed afterwards.
  * The same error occurs with `ComplexF32` and `ComplexF64` types, but not `Float64`.
  * According to @carstenbauer, the issue is also present in 1.6.4, 1.7.0.rc-2, 1.7.0.rc-3, 1.7.0.
  * 1.6.3 and the current master branch do not exhibit the issue.
More detailed info: On my machine, inv works for all element types up to a
certain size. For `Float32`, the failure size is 514 by 514 and for the
complex types, itâ€™s 258 by 258. Below these cutoffs, everything works as
usual.
