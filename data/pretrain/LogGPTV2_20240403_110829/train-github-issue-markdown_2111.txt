I just reviewed a PR with the line `case err.Error() == "http: can't write
HTTP request on broken connection"`. That's brittle code, and it's hard to
test in a way that ensures it stays in sync with any changes to the error
message wording in net/http--but there's no way to improve upon it given the
errors the http package emits.
Possible improments:
  * net/http could predeclare its errors
  * or make a custom error type
Any mechanism is fine as long as it lets the compiler check that people are
referring to the error they intend to.
(I realize this is probably low priority.)
