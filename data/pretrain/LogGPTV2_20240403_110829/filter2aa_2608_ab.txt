# LAN Device Detection Techniques

## 1. Using Request Sequences as Feature Codes
- **Rationale**: The request list in DHCP packets can vary based on the implementation of different DHCP clients.
- **Example (Windows 7 Packet)**:
  - Locate Option 55/0x37 and skip one byte (length).
  - Compare the following sequence: 0x01, 0x0f, 0x03, 0x06, 0x2c, 0x2e, 0x2f, 0x1f, 0x21, 0x79, 0xf9, 0x2b.
  - Decimal equivalent: 1, 15, 3, 6, 44, 46, 47, 31, 33, 121, 249, 43.

## 2. Checking DHCP Options
- **DHCP Option 55 Characteristics**:
  - **Windows 7/Server 2008**: 1, 15, 3, 6, 44, 46, 47, 31, 33, 121, 249, 43.
  - **Windows 8**:
    - 1, 15, 3, 6, 44, 46, 47, 31, 33, 121, 249, 252, 43.
    - 1, 3, 6, 15, 33, 44, 46, 47, 121, 249, 43, 60, 212.
  - **Apple iPod, iPhone, or iPad**:
    - 1, 3, 6, 15, 119, 78, 79, 95, 252.
    - 1, 3, 6, 15, 119, 252.
    - 1, 3, 6, 15, 119, 252, 46, 208, 92.
    - 1, 3, 6, 15, 119, 252, 67, 52, 13.

## 3. Analyzing HTTP User-Agent Strings
- **Rationale**: Sometimes, checking the user-agent string for specific keywords is a viable option.
- **Considerations**:
  - While user-agent strings are easier to spoof compared to MAC addresses or DHCP Option 55, they can still be useful.
  - Examples:
    - **Internet Explorer 11 on Windows 7**:
      ```plaintext
      User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/7.0; rv:11.0; GTB7.5) like Gecko
      ```
    - **iPhone**:
      ```plaintext
      User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; U; CPU iPhone OS 4_3 like Mac OS X; en-gb) AppleWebKit/533.17.9 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/5.0.2 Mobile/8F190 Safari/6533.18.5
      ```

## 4. Identifying Applications
- **Challenges**:
  - Some devices do not have Ethernet/Wi-Fi and must communicate through an IoT Gateway.
  - Traditional methods include using IP addresses, domain names, traffic patterns, or string-based patterns.
- **AppID Techniques**:
  - **Pattern-Based AppID**: Early identification and labeling of connections for Quality of Service (QoS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS).
  - **SSL-Based AppID**: Identify SSL connections by examining certificate keywords.
  - **Encrypted AppID**: For private encryption or encoding, use direction, packet length, and finite state machines (FSM) to match connections.

## 5. Suitable Devices for LAN Device Identification
- **IoT Home Routers/Gateways**:
  - These are strategic points for data exchange between LAN and WAN.
  - True source MAC addresses and DHCP Option 55 are typically visible only in the LAN.
- **Resource Constraints**:
  - Most home routers have limited RAM (typically 32MB to 128MB), which limits the functionality that can be implemented.
  - Security functions often receive minimal resources, making it a significant challenge.

## 6. Threat Intelligence with LDI
- **Collaboration with Home Router Vendors**:
  - Collect user-consented logs and aggregate them in the cloud for timely, accurate, and relevant threat intelligence.
- **Anonymized Statistics**:
  - Provide insights into device types, traffic patterns, and security events.

## 7. Summary
- **Key Points**:
  - In the IoT era, automated network device identification is essential.
  - On the LAN side, we can use MAC OUI and DHCP packets to gather brand and operating system information.
  - Accurate device identification, combined with big data analytics, is crucial for effective threat intelligence.
