When using Google Chrome on a Windows system, I encountered an issue with the modal on the demo page at <http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/>. 

Upon opening a new browser session and launching the modal, the "Close" button and the "X" icon function correctly the first time. However, when attempting to close the modal a second time, it fails to close.

Here is a more detailed description:

1. **Environment:**
   - Browser: Google Chrome
   - Operating System: Windows
   - URL: <http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/>

2. **Steps to Reproduce:**
   1. Open a new browser session in Google Chrome.
   2. Navigate to the demo page at <http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/>.
   3. Launch the modal from the demo page.
   4. Click the "Close" button or the "X" icon to close the modal. (This works as expected the first time.)
   5. Re-launch the modal.
   6. Attempt to close the modal again by clicking the "Close" button or the "X" icon. (The modal fails to close.)

3. **Expected Behavior:**
   - The modal should close successfully each time the "Close" button or the "X" icon is clicked.

4. **Actual Behavior:**
   - The modal closes successfully the first time but fails to close on subsequent attempts.

Please let me know if you need any further information or if there are additional steps to troubleshoot this issue.
