of the antennas that he uses. Despite considering a strong
attacker, the work focuses the evaluation of the proposed
scheme on an attacker with a single antenna.
III. JAMMING MITIGATION USING CHANNEL
RESOLUTION
Friendly jamming can only achieve data conﬁdentiality if
the attacker cannot recover the data signal. Remote jammer
schemes, where the friendly jammer is far (> λ/2) from
the transmitting device, were studied in prior work and their
limitations in terms of attacker placement as well as number
and directionality of his antennas are well known. Nearby
jammer schemes promised to signiﬁcantly raise the security
guarantees, based on the assumption that the friendly jammer
and the transmitting device are collocated. They pose no
special restrictions on the attacker, except that he is not too
close to the jammer or the transmitter. We focus on nearby
jammer schemes and show that their security guarantees are
weaker than it was so far believed.
The security of friendly jamming schemes is typically
argued by considering signal strengths, non-separability of
channels using MIMO techniques, and the information rate
of the combined data/jamming signal. Here, we investigate
channel non-separability arguments in more detail and ana-
lyze whether it is possible for the attacker to use techniques
similar to MIMO in order to separate the jamming and data
signal even if the jammer and transmitter are close.
We begin with a brief example of the attack to give an
intuition, and then derive why the attacker, in our setting, is
able to separate the data signal from the jamming signal.
A. Example of our Attack
Consider the following scenario shown in Figure 3b. The
attacker is equipped with two antennas (A and B) which
are equidistant from the jamming source (AJ = BJ), but
not equidistant from the data source (AD (cid:2)= BD). Both
antennas receive a composite signal, consisting of a data
component as well as a jamming component. As a result,
the received signal at A and B have each a different relative
phase offsets between the data and signal component.
Because both antennas of the attacker are equidistant to
the jammer, the signal received by both antennas will contain
the jamming signal with same phase. The data component
is received with some phase offset δ depending on the geo-
metric setting. Lets assume that in this example, the phase
shift is equal to half a wavelength, i.e., δ = π (in radians).
In Figure 3a we depict the two received signals as well
as their individual components. By subtracting the received
signals, the attacker can remove the jamming component
and obtain an ampliﬁed data component. Since the jamming
components have the same amplitude and phase, it is easy
to see that they are eliminated when the signals are sub-
tracted. Differently, when two λ/2-shifted data components
are subtracted, they constructively interfere, resulting in an
ampliﬁed data signal.
From this example, it follows that there are indeed con-
stellations in which the attacker can recover the data signal.
We now investigate these conditions in more detail. We
ﬁrst brieﬂy review a standard MIMO line-of-sight (LOS)
channel model which states that the channel should not be
resolvable and signals should not be separable. We show
why this channel model does not exactly capture our use case
here—it requires a certain minimal distance between sender
and receiver. We then compute the approximation error of
this standard model for the nearby jammer case. Finally, we
identify a way to separate the data and jamming channel
leveraging the observation on the approximation error and
show, for selected settings, resulting bit error rates of the
attacker when he recovers the data signal.
B. MIMO Basics
In this
context, multiple-input
and multiple-output
(MIMO) denotes a setting in which a transmitter uses mul-
tiple antennas to transmit a wireless message to a receiver
with multiple antennas. Among other aspects, the channel
diversity between the transmitting and receiving antennas
enables the receiver to improve the received signal quality in
presence of fading channels and can also be used to improve
spectral efﬁciency. For example, multiple antennas can pro-
vide a simple power gain when aligned correctly. Multiple
antennas can also help to mitigate random effects of channel
fading. A normal MIMO setting assumes that sender and
receiver are collaborating to improve their communication.
In our setting, we are investigating whether the attacker can
recover signals sent by the transmitter in the presence of

the data source.
a jammer, without the collaboration of neither jammer nor
transmitter. For a thorough introduction into MIMO, we refer
to [24].
C. Line-of-Sight MIMO Model
For our discussion, we assume that the attacker has two
omni directional antennas (A, B) which he can place at any
distance to the jammer J that is greater than the distance
between the jammer J and the data source D antennas. We
further consider a case in which the transmitting antennas
(D and J) are placed less than λ/2 apart from each other.
A standard way to model wireless transmissions in our
setting is the following description:
y = Hx + w
Applied to our use-case, y = [sA sB]T is the column
vector of signals received by the attacker, H is a channel
matrix, x = [sd sj]T is the vector of source signals and
w is additional random channel noise. For the following
discussion, we omit the noise to simplify the equations.
The channel matrix H depends on the chosen channel
model. Here, we approximate the channel as several line-
of-sight paths. For this setting, a standard channel model
can be found in § 7.2.3 in [24], on which we will base
our discussion. We call the resulting channel matrix H m to
differentiate from a second model we will introduce later.

only with small phase offsets approximated based on the
geometric setup. To simplify the computations, the model
assumes that all signals are received along the same direc-
tion between A and D (shown in Figure 4). The relative
position of the other receiving antenna with regards to A
is expressed as distance Δrλ and the angle φr, the same
for the transmitting array with φt and Δtλ, respectively. Δt
and Δr are the length of the transmit and receive arrays,
normalized to the wavelength λ. To simplify the formulas,
we deﬁne Ω := cos φ. Based on these variables, the model
presents H m as:

and an attenuation factor a.
It can be seen that H m has rank 1 and thus y must also
have rank at most 1. Indeed, although y has a dimension
equal to the number of antennas of the receiver, all antennas
essentially receive a linear combination of the same signals
if the rank of y is 1. It follows that the sources cannot be
separated based on these linear combinations alone.
In this way, the channel model H m states that the attacker
cannot eliminate a second nearby signal source such as a
friendly jammer.

For simplicity, we will start with showing the approx-

distance d between the RX/TX arrays and each arrays with
two antennas Δr = Δt apart (both distances measured in
carrier wavelengths). For this, we insert φt = φr = 90◦ (via
Ωr and Ωt) into Equation 2 and Equation 3, which allows
us to rewrite Equation 1 as the following channel matrix,

“Assuming again that the antenna array sizes are
much smaller than the distance between the trans-
mitter and the receiver [...]”
We now examine the approximation error of this LOS
MIMO model for our use case (in which the antenna array
sizes is not “much smaller” than the distance) and how this
approximation error inﬂuences the security of the proposed
friendly jamming scheme.
To summarize the parameters for the model,
in our
use case we have two antenna arrays (RX/TX), with two
antennas each. The two antennas of the transmitting array
are set up such that Δt ≤ 0.5. The distance d between
the transmitting and receiving array is between 1 and 10
wavelengths , thus violating the model assumption regarding
distance. In this setting, we are in particular interested in the
phase offset between the two transmitted signals sd, sn at the
two receiving antennas.
As H g is clearly different to H m (e.g. H g has rank 2 for
Δt > 0 and a (cid:2)= 0), the simpliﬁed model H m has to have
some approximation error. In particular, we are interested
in the difference of phase offsets of the data and jamming
signal, i.e. δ = ∠h11 − ∠h12 − ∠h21 + ∠h22, where ∠hij is
the phase of the ith row and jth column entry of a channel
matrix H. For the model from [24], δ(d) = 0. In Figure 5,
we show the approximation error of the model for small
distances d, up to 20 times the carrier wavelength. It can be
seen that up to a distance of 2.5 wavelengths, δ can reach
0.1 and more. As we show later, such values for δ can allow
the attacker to eliminate the noise signal and recover the data
signal perfectly. Thus, the simpliﬁed approximation in H m
should only apply to values of d much larger than λ, as was
the condition stated for the model.
