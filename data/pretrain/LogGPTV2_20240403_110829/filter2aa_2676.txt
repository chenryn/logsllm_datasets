Notice to CD Users
 If you are reading this off of the CD, 
please note that I have a lot of info in 
the speakers notes, I like to keep the 
slides terse, and put most of what I will 
discuss in the speakers notes of the 
PowerPoint. Also check to see if a newer 
revision of the slide deck has been 
released

Different Approaches
 For some the current mission is free 
public Internet Access
 For some the mission is to build 
Infrastructure that is completely 
community owned, does not rely on 
existing Telco lines, and may not 
necessarily provide Internet access

Why is this happening?
 Standards based technology is finally available 
 Extremely inexpensive gear
 Growing desire for connectivity anywhere
 Techies/Hackers feel like they are being 
screwed over by ISPs
 Think BBS, Fidonet etc... (Geeks like to connect 
computers together)

Confusion
 Why would anyone do anything for free?
 Venture Capitalists want to know the 
secret plan?
 Who pays for it?
 Will this hurt or hinder other models
