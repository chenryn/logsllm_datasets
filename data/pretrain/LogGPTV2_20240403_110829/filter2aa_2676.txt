#### What are Freenetworks?
- **Open Peering/Free Transit:** Anyone can join and start routing packets.
- **Community Wireless Networks:** These networks are free as in "free speech," emphasizing open access and community ownership.

---

#### Different Approaches
- **Mission: Free Public Internet Access:** Some groups aim to provide free internet access to the public.
- **Mission: Community-Owned Infrastructure:** Other groups focus on building infrastructure that is entirely community-owned, independent of existing telecom lines, and may not necessarily provide internet access.

---

#### Why is This Happening?
- **Standards-Based Technology:** Finally, accessible and standardized technology is available.
- **Inexpensive Gear:** The cost of networking equipment has significantly decreased.
- **Growing Connectivity Demand:** There is an increasing desire for connectivity anywhere.
- **Techies and Hackers:** Many feel exploited by ISPs and are motivated to create their own solutions.
- **Historical Context:** Similar to BBS (Bulletin Board Systems) and Fidonet, geeks have a long-standing interest in connecting computers.

---

#### Potential Foes
- **ISPs:** Providers of unlimited data plans are already feeling the pressure.
- **3G Deployment:** Questions about the availability and reliability of 3G services.
- **WISPs (Wireless Internet Service Providers):** Concerns about crowded frequency bands.
- **Regulatory Issues:** Devices like Pringles Can-tennas are not FCC certified.

---

#### Potential Friends
- **Geek Community:** Always critical of traditional telcos.
- **Media:** Loves the "controversy" surrounding these initiatives.
- **ISPs:** Another point of contention for them to address.

---

#### Common Confusions
- **Why Free?** People often wonder why anyone would offer something for free.
- **Venture Capitalists:** Curious about the underlying business model.
- **Funding:** Questions about who pays for the infrastructure.
- **Impact on Models:** Concerns about whether these networks will harm or help other models.

---

#### Privacy Benefits
- **Decentralized Ownership:** Network ownership is distributed, making it harder to establish a single inspection point.
- **No Personal Data Required:** Users do not need to provide personal information to join or use the network.

---

#### Community vs. Independently Owned Infrastructure
- **New Paradigm:** A different approach from the traditional centralized model.
- **Local Loop Monopoly:** Breaking down the monopoly on local loop infrastructure.
- **Rapid Deployment:** Faster implementation of new technologies.
- **Promoting R&D:** Encourages research and development in the field.

---

#### Peer-to-Peer Advantages
- **Location-Based Apps:** Enhanced location-based applications.
- **Efficiency in P2P:** Increased efficiency in peer-to-peer file sharing.
- **Local Sharing:** Why download from the internet when your neighbor has the file on a wireless link?

---

#### How to Start
1. **Check Local Groups:** See if there is an existing group in your area.
2. **Organize:** Start a mailing list and website to organize meetings and events.
3. **Research:** Read through the mailing lists and websites of existing groups.
