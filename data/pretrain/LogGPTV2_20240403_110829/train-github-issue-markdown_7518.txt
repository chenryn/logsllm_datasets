It looks like when using the JSONLoader in r74, the first named bone in an
exported Maya scene gets a duplicate of all the geometry.
Here's a JSFiddle that shows my current code and the issue.
In this example I have 2 boxes. Each box is bound to a single bone, and each
of those bones has keyframes that animate the position and rotation. There is
another bone that has no geometry bound to it, and has keyframes that make no
change to its position or rotation.
The stationary bone is called "joint1" in Maya. The bones that actually have
geometry bound to them are called "joint2" and "joint3". If I were to rename
the stationary bone "joint4" the result would be a duplicate of both boxes
attached to the currently animating "joint2".
