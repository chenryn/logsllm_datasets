estimate would be that at least 645 devices could be accessed in 
this manner. 
Based  on  the  priorities  assigned  to  threats  and  the 
information we collected, we designated three levels of risk to 
classify  the devices  to assist with  guiding remediation  efforts.  
Table  II  shows  our  descriptions  of  the  three  categories  and 
Table III shows the number of devices classified into each level 
of risk.  Devices in the “high” risk category require immediate 
action to reduce the threat of information disclosure.  Device in 
the “medium” risk category should be addressed next to reduce 
the threats of information disclosure and/or privilege elevation 
(which  could  be  used  to  make  changes  leading  to  increased 
threat  of  information  disclosure).    Following  these  actions, 
policies  and  procedures  could  be  developed  and  distributed 
campus-wide 
recommended 
configurations  and  access  controls  to  improve  the  security  of 
the  lower  risk  devices.    We  did  not  include  a  fourth  category 
for  “secure”  devices—while  there  are  probably  some  present 
on the campus network, most likely our scans and information 
gathering  procedures  would  not  have  been  able  to  access  the 
devices.    Therefore  we  are  unable  to  estimate  the  number  of 
“secure” devices at this time.

most  severe  applicable  risk. 
  We  found  essentially  no 
difference between our on-campus and off-campus scans in the 
context  of  our  defined  risk  categories.    While  in  a  few  cases 
some  services  available  from  on-campus  were  not  directly 
reachable  from  off-campus,  these  instances  were  rare  and  did 
not result in changing the risk category for the device. 
IV.  RECOMMENDATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS 
Based on our findings, we note there are several steps that 
can be taken to improve the security of these devices.  To help 
prevent  the  disclosure  of  PII  or  sensitive  information,  users 
should be specifically informed of the capabilities of the device 
they  are  using.    If  a  device  has  the  ability  to  store  and  serve 
documents, users should know this when they use the device to 
scan  or  copy  documents  with  PII  or  sensitive  information.  
From  an  examination  of  the  documents  and  from  anecdotal 
examples, it was clear that in some cases the user did not know 
or  intend  for  a  document  to  be  stored  on  the  device.    This 
seemed  more  likely  when  the  devices  were  used  for  personal 
use (documents copied or scanned with information pertaining 
to the user) but also seems to have occurred when the devices 
were used in an official capacity (for example, copies made by 
a  staff  or  faculty  member  with  information  pertaining  to 
applicants).    Users  of  these  devices  should  be  aware  of  their 
potential  to  store  this  information  and  the  users  should  know 
how  to  check  if  this  has  occurred  or  should  know  who  to 
contact  to  verify  that PII  or  sensitive  information  is  not being 
stored  unsecured  or  made  publicly  available.    Many  devices 
allow  users  to  delete  their  stored  documents  (depending  on 
access  and  authentication  configurations)  and  we  feel  more 
would  choose  to  check  for  and  delete  stored  PII  if  they  were 
more aware that such PII was potentially being stored. 
requiring  authentication 
Next,  the  combination  of  properly  configuring  network 
access  controls  and 
to  make 
configuration changes (especially via the web interface) would 
help  reduce  many  of  the  other  threats  as  well  as  limiting  the 
pool  of  attackers  who  could  potentially  access  stored 
documents.  While ideally network access should be restricted 
to the smallest amount needed to perform necessary functions, 
some  devices  are  used  by  groups  or  departments  which  may 
span  many  separate  subnets.   At  a  minimum,  access  could  be 
restricted to on-campus only and require the use of a VPN for 
off-campus  access.    However,  this  still  requires  individual 
configuration of devices and not some type of blocking at the 
borders of the campus network. 
Shrinking  the  pool  of  potential  attackers  using  network 
access  restrictions  is  still  not  a  substitute  for  disabling 
unneeded services.  Reducing the attack surface of the devices 
by only running necessary services can also reduce risk.  It is 
difficult  to  access  or  exploit  services  that  are  not  enabled.  
Again,  this  needs  to  be  coupled  with  requiring  authentication 
for  configuration  changes  to  be  most  effective.    Otherwise  it 
may be trivial for an attacker to simply re-enable a service they 
wish to access or exploit. 
Updating  firmware  is  also  a  good  practice.    Some  newer 
firmware  version  have  actually  added  useful  features  for 
security the devices which were not present in older versions of 
the  firmware.    Other  updates  to  firmware  may  specifically 
address security vulnerabilities discovered in previous versions.  
We  examined  the  ability  of  an  attacker  with  access  to  a 
machine  on  the  campus  network  to  obtain  passwords  from 
vulnerable  devices  and  found  cases  where 
this  could 
successfully be applied. 
While  there  are  many  different  manufacturers  and  models 
of  these  networked  office  devices,  potentially  with  unique 
features and settings, guides for securing specific models on the 
campus network could be made available along with including 
recommendations  for  proper  handling  of  PII  and  sensitive 
information  relative  to  these  devices.    The  specific  models  to 
address first would be ones most likely to be in the “high” risk 
category,  even  if  they  are  not  as  common  as  other  models.  
Next to address would be models most commonly seen in the 
“medium” to “low” risk categories.

university.    We  identified  1,823  devices  and  classified  them 
into  three  risk  levels  based  on  the  information  we  collected.  
We confirmed that some of these devices currently posed some 
immediate  privacy  risks  based  on  finding  some  PII  and 
sensitive  information  that  was  publicly  accessible.    We  also 
assessed the risk of some threats to security based on properties 
of  devices  configurations  and  settings.    While  the  risks  to 
security were judged to be less severe than the risks to privacy, 
the  prevalence  of  security  risks  was  much  greater.  We 
discussed  some  recommendations  would  help  reduce  both  the 
risks to privacy and security to the university environment that 
these devices currently present.
