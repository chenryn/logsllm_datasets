ABSTRACT 
In  this  paper,  a  framework  of  end  to  end  (E2E)  trusted  cloud 
infrastructure is proposed. On one end of the cloud provider, the 
trusted  chain 
trusted 
measurement and remote attestation, which can assure the trust of 
VMM and VM. On another end of the cloud terminal, the trusted 
mechanism is used to protect the terminal security.  For the trust 
of cloud network, trusted network connect (TNC) is leveraged to 
protect the security of communication between the loud provider 
and  the  cloud  terminal.  The  E2E  trusted  cloud  infrastructure 
provides  an  E2E  trusted  protection  for  cloud  computing.  In 
addition, it can support the Chinese cryptographic algorithm (SMx) 
based on TPM 2.0.

infrastructure.  However, 
The  secuirity  of  cloud  infrastuctre  is  the  fundation  of  cloud 
security.  Trusted  computing  is  a  feasible  approach  of  establishing 
trusted  cloud  computing 
the  current 
approach for protecting cloud infrastucture is still faced with  some 
chanledges, for example, there is a lack of trust protection mechanism 
for  VMs  themseleves  in  cloud  and  an  overall  trust  protection 
approach for cloud platform. Existing techniques like Terra [1], TXT 
[2]  and  tboot  [3]  mainly  focus  on  the  trust  of  VM  running 
environment, such as the trust of hosts and virtual machine monitors 
(VMM) [4, 5], but attacks still probaly compromize the users' virtual 
machines  by  exploiting  the  vulnerabilities  of  vitalization  programs 
[6]. In addtion, a cloud terminal is a part of the cloud platform. Its 
security is also crucial to cloud enviorment. Hence, an overall trust 
protection is required for protecting cloud environments.

To  address  such  challenges,  we  propose  a  comprehensive  trusted 
protection  approach  for  cloud  infrastucture.  On  one  end  of  cloud 
provider,  we  extend  the  trusted  chain  to  VMM  and  VM  by  the 
trusted measurement and remote attestation, which can assure the 
trust of VMM and VM. On another end of cloud terminal, we use 
trusted  computing  mechanism  to  protect  the  security  of  the 
terminal.  For the trust of cloud network, trusted network connect 
(TNC)  is  leveraged  to  protect  the  security  of  communication 
between  the  cloud  provider  and  the  cloud  terminal.  Thus,  the 
solution  provides  an  overall  trusted  protection  mechanism.  In 
addition, it can support the Chinese cryptographic algorithm(SMx) 
based on TPM 2.0.  
Related Work. Santos et al. [7] presented the design of a trusted 
cloud compute platform, which leverages trusted coordinator and 
a trusted virtual machine monitor to ensure VMs are running on a 
trusted cluster. The limitation of such a solution is that a trusted 
coordinator (TC) which is inside an external trusted entity beyond 
the cloud platform like VeriSign is needed, making it hard to be 
adopted in practice. Mudassar Aslamet al. [9] proposed a secure 
VM  launch  protocol  using  Trusted  Computing.  However,  they 
still  focused  on  the  integrity  of  VM  running  environment,  and 
ignored the security of the VMs themselves. Schiffman et al. [8] 
proposed  a  centralized  verification  service  called  cloud  verifier 
(CV). A user can request to CV to verify the trust of a VM and a 
host. Nicolae Paladi et al. [10] provided a protocol to ensure the 
launch of a VM instance. But their method lacks the measurement 
and  remote  attestation  mechanism  for  VMs.  Moreover,  they 
cannot provide a proof-of-concept implementation. Chen Chen et 
al.[11]  presents  cTPM,  an  extension  of  the  TPM’s  design  that 
adds an additional root key to the TPM and shares that root key 
with  the  cloud.  Therefore,  it  enables  the  simple  sharing  of  keys 
and data across a user’s multiple devices. We provide the trusted 
protection approach for VM themselves besides the trust of VM 
running  environment.  In  addition,  we  give  an  overall  trusted 
protection approach for cloud infrastucture. 
Contributions: our contributions are summarized as follows: 
(1)  We  present  a  trusted  protection  mechanism  for  virtual 
machines in cloud. 
(2)  We  provide  a  framework  of  end  to  end  (E2E)  trusted  cloud 
infrastructure. 
(3)  Our system firstly uses the TPM 2.0 chip which can support 
Chinese  cryptographic  algorithm,  such  as  SMx.  Moreover  we 
firstly  implement  a  subset  of  TSS  2.0  in  order  to  achieve  the 
trusted features in cloud.

2.  FRAMEWORK & IMPLEMENTATION 
Our  trusted  protection  framework  is  depicted  in  fig.  1.  The 
framework is comprised of trusted launch and running of virtual 
machines, trusted network connect and trusted cloud terminal. We 
realize  the  trusted  boot  process  of  a  platform  and  remote 
attestation  based  on  Tboot  (Trusted  boot)  and  OAT  in  trusted 
servers with TPM2.0/SMx. Based on it, we extend the trust chain 
to the inside of virtual machines, so as to build a complete trust 
chain from the bottom to the top. Furthermore, through mandatory 
access control based on domain-type enhancement and the static 
measurement  and  dynamic  measurement  of  a  host  or  VM,  the 
system  can  provide  comprehensive  security  for  VMM  and 
VMs,so  as  to  effectively  prevent  computer  viruses  and  Trojan 
horses  from  attacking  or  tampering  with  the  system  running 
environment. In addition, a cloud terminal also embeds TPM2.0 
chip so that it can be measured while accessing the trusted cloud 
platform. Moreover the communication between the VMs and the 
cloud  terminal  is  also  protected  by  TNC  mechanism  as  well.  In 
brief,  through  trusted  launch  and  running  of  a  virtual  machine, 
trusted  cloud  terminal  and  TNC  mechanism,  we  can  establish  a 
more secure end to end (E2E) trusted computing environment in 
IaaS cloud. 
Trusted Virtual Machines. Virtual machines that store user 
data  including  some  sensitive  information  are  leased  to  users  in 
IaaS  cloud.  Once  the  data  is  leaked  outside  of  the  virtual 
machines, it will definitely damage interests of users. Thus, how 
to protect the security of virtual machines is crucial in IaaS cloud.  
To address such a critical problem, we propose a trusted launch 
approach for virtual machines. For our approach, three systematic 
mechanisms  including  image  encryption,  measurement,  and 
remote attestation are used to protect virtual machines. The image 
encryption  mechanism  can  prevent  illegal  users  from  starting  a 
VM, while measurement and attestation mechanisms can protect 
the integrity of a VM. Consequently, our approach can protect the 
whole launch process of a VM in cloud computing.  
For image encryption, considering a tradeoff between security 
and performance, we only encrypt the main disk information of a
