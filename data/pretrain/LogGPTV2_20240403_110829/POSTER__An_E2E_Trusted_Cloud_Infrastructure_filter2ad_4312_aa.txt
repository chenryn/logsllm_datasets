## Abstract
This paper introduces a framework for an end-to-end (E2E) trusted cloud infrastructure. At the cloud provider's end, the trusted chain is extended to the Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM) and Virtual Machines (VMs) through trusted measurement and remote attestation, ensuring their trustworthiness. On the cloud terminal side, trusted computing mechanisms are employed to protect terminal security. For secure cloud network communication, Trusted Network Connect (TNC) is utilized to safeguard data exchange between the cloud provider and the cloud terminal. This E2E trusted cloud infrastructure provides comprehensive protection for cloud computing and supports Chinese cryptographic algorithms (SMx) based on TPM 2.0.

## 1. Introduction
The security of cloud infrastructure is fundamental to the overall security of cloud environments. Trusted computing is a viable approach to establishing trusted cloud computing. However, current methods for protecting cloud infrastructure face several challenges, such as a lack of trust protection mechanisms for VMs and an overall trust protection approach for the cloud platform. Existing techniques like Terra [1], TXT [2], and tboot [3] primarily focus on the trust of the VM running environment, including the trust of hosts and VMMs [4, 5]. Nevertheless, these solutions can still be compromised by exploiting vulnerabilities in virtualization programs [6].

Additionally, the security of cloud terminals, which are integral to the cloud platform, is also crucial. Therefore, a comprehensive trust protection mechanism is required to safeguard the entire cloud environment.

To address these challenges, we propose a comprehensive trusted protection approach for cloud infrastructure. On the cloud provider's end, we extend the trusted chain to the VMM and VMs using trusted measurement and remote attestation, ensuring their trustworthiness. On the cloud terminal side, we employ trusted computing mechanisms to protect terminal security. For secure cloud network communication, TNC is used to protect data exchange between the cloud provider and the cloud terminal. This solution provides an overall trusted protection mechanism and supports Chinese cryptographic algorithms (SMx) based on TPM 2.0.

### Related Work
- **Santos et al. [7]**: Presented a trusted cloud compute platform leveraging a trusted coordinator and a trusted VMM to ensure VMs run on a trusted cluster. The limitation is the need for an external trusted entity, making it difficult to adopt in practice.
- **Mudassar Aslam et al. [9]**: Proposed a secure VM launch protocol using Trusted Computing, focusing on the integrity of the VM running environment but ignoring VM security.
- **Schiffman et al. [8]**: Introduced a centralized verification service called Cloud Verifier (CV), allowing users to verify the trust of a VM and host.
- **Nicolae Paladi et al. [10]**: Provided a protocol to ensure the launch of a VM instance but lacked measurement and remote attestation mechanisms.
- **Chen Chen et al. [11]**: Presented cTPM, an extension of TPM’s design that adds an additional root key to the TPM and shares it with the cloud, enabling simple sharing of keys and data across multiple devices.

Our approach provides trusted protection for VMs themselves, in addition to the trust of the VM running environment, and offers an overall trusted protection mechanism for cloud infrastructure.

### Contributions

- We provide a framework for an end-to-end (E2E) trusted cloud infrastructure.
- Our system uses TPM 2.0 chips to support Chinese cryptographic algorithms (SMx) and implements a subset of TSS 2.0 to achieve trusted features in the cloud.

## 2. Framework & Implementation
Our trusted protection framework, depicted in Figure 1, includes trusted launch and running of VMs, trusted network connect, and trusted cloud terminal. We realize the trusted boot process and remote attestation using Tboot (Trusted Boot) and OAT in trusted servers with TPM2.0/SMx. This extends the trust chain to the inside of VMs, building a complete trust chain from the bottom to the top. Through mandatory access control based on domain-type enhancement and static and dynamic measurements of the host or VM, the system provides comprehensive security, effectively preventing computer viruses and Trojan horses from attacking or tampering with the system running environment.

Cloud terminals also embed TPM2.0 chips, allowing them to be measured while accessing the trusted cloud platform. Communication between VMs and the cloud terminal is protected by the TNC mechanism. In summary, through trusted launch and running of VMs, trusted cloud terminal, and TNC mechanism, we establish a more secure E2E trusted computing environment in IaaS cloud.

### Trusted Virtual Machines
In IaaS clouds, VMs store user data, including sensitive information. Data leakage can severely damage user interests. To address this, we propose a trusted launch approach for VMs, using three systematic mechanisms: image encryption, measurement, and remote attestation. Image encryption prevents unauthorized users from starting a VM, while measurement and attestation mechanisms protect the integrity of the VM. This approach ensures the security of the entire VM launch process in cloud computing.

For image encryption, we balance security and performance by encrypting only the main disk information of the VM.
