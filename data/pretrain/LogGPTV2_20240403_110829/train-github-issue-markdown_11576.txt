##### ISSUE TYPE
  * Feature Idea
##### COMPONENT NAME
Windows
##### ANSIBLE VERSION
v2.5
##### SUMMARY
Much like sudo on Unix, it would be nice to be able to run modules as any user
(from an Administrator account) without the need to use passwords (which you
may not know). When managing multi-user systems this is a necessity in order
to manage configuration items of user environments.
This is a continuation of #34214
