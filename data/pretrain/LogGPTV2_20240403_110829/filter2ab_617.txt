### Title: When Lightning Strikes Thrice: Breaking Thunderbolt 3 Security

**Abstract:**

Thunderbolt, a high-bandwidth interconnect promoted by Intel, is widely used in laptops, desktops, and other systems. As a PCIe-based interface, Thunderbolt devices have Direct Memory Access (DMA)-enabled I/O, making them a potential entry point for "evil maid" DMA attacks. In such attacks, adversaries with brief physical access to the victim's system can steal data from encrypted drives and read or write all system memory. To mitigate these risks, Intel introduced "Security Levels," a security architecture designed to allow users to authorize only trusted Thunderbolt devices. This system also includes cryptographic authentication of connections to prevent device spoofing.

In this paper, we present **Thunderspy**, a series of attacks that compromise the primary security claims of Thunderbolt 1, 2, and 3. Our research has identified seven vulnerabilities:

1. Inadequate firmware verification schemes
2. Weak device authentication scheme
3. Use of unauthenticated device metadata
4. Downgrade attack using backward compatibility
5. Use of unauthenticated controller configurations
6. SPI flash interface deficiencies
7. No Thunderbolt security on Boot Camp

We also present nine practical exploitation scenarios. Under an "evil maid" threat model and varying Security Levels, we demonstrate the ability to:

- Create arbitrary Thunderbolt device identities
- Clone user-authorized Thunderbolt devices
- Obtain PCIe connectivity to perform DMA attacks

Additionally, we show how to override Security Level configurations without authentication, including the ability to disable Thunderbolt security entirely and restore Thunderbolt connectivity if the system is restricted to passing through USB and/or DisplayPort. We conclude by demonstrating the ability to permanently disable Thunderbolt security and block all future firmware updates.

**Impact:**

- All Thunderbolt-equipped systems shipped between 2011 and 2020 are vulnerable.
- Some systems providing Kernel DMA Protection, which began shipping in 2019, are partially vulnerable.
- The Thunderspy vulnerabilities cannot be fixed via software updates and will impact future standards such as USB4 and Thunderbolt 4.
- A silicon redesign will be required to address these vulnerabilities.

This research highlights the critical need for robust hardware-level security measures to protect against sophisticated attacks on high-speed interconnects like Thunderbolt.
