## The Algorithm of Adversarial Path Reconnaissance

**Algorithm 1: Improved Adversarial Path Reconnaissance**

**Input:**
- η: Number of repeated reconnaissances for each data path and the number of data in each group used in the t-test.
- twait: Waiting time for rules to expire.
- tmax: Maximum waiting time for each timing packet to get a response in the target network.
- α: Significance level used in the t-test.

**Output:**
- h: Host that is part of a data path crossing with control paths.

**Steps:**
1. **ScanAllHosts()**: Get all hosts in the network to explore the data paths between the compromised host and them.
2. **Initialize kmax**: Set the maximum number of data paths that can be explored within two timeout values.
3. **Main Loop (Step 4 to Step 29)**: In each iteration, test kmax data paths.
   - **Step 5 to Step 20**: Collect 2η latencies of the crossed control paths for each of the kmax data paths.
     - **Step 7 to Step 10**: Obtain the delay of crossed control paths when the testing stream is not transmitted.
     - **Step 13 to Step 18**: Obtain the delay while transmitting the testing stream.
     - **Step 11 and Step 19**: Pause the program to ensure old rules expire before the next reconnaissance.
4. **t-test (Step 21 to Step 27)**: Apply the t-test to determine if a data path crosses with control paths.
   - If the group of latencies with the testing stream is significantly higher, output the destination host and terminate.
   - Otherwise, prepare for the next round of iteration.

**Experimental Settings:**
- **twait**: 30 seconds, larger than the default timeouts in the Floodlight controller.
- **tmax**: 1 second for each timing packet to get a response.
- **η and α**: Vary as needed.

## Defense Against the CrossPath Attack

We explore two defense schemes to mitigate the CrossPath attack:
1. **High-Priority Delivery of Control Traffic**:
   - Use Priority Queue (PQ) or Weighted Round Robin (WRR) queuing mechanisms in SDN switches.
   - Network administrators can add SetQueue actions to flow rules associated with switch ports in the control paths.
   - Control traffic is directed to a high-priority queue, ensuring it is forwarded without disturbances from other traffic.

2. **Proactive Bandwidth Reservation for Control Traffic**:
   - Use OpenFlow meter tables to limit the total rate of packets matching data traffic flow rules.
   - Reserve bandwidth for control traffic by assigning each data traffic flow rule a meter entry with the SetMeter action.
   - This ensures proprietary bandwidth for control traffic, even if some switches do not support PQ or WRR mechanisms.

**Evaluation:**
- **PQ or WRR Mechanisms** (Figure 18a and 18b):
  - Effective protection of control traffic with throughput reaching approximately 1,000 pps.
  - Delays of more than 99% of control packets are less than 10 ms.
- **Proactive Bandwidth Reservation** (Figure 19a and 19b):
  - Larger reserved bandwidth results in higher throughput and better delay performance.
  - 16 Mbps reserved bandwidth is sufficient to ensure control traffic forwarding.
  - Requires proactive reservation of enough bandwidth, which may be in the order of several Gbps in large networks.

**Table 1: Flow Rule Settings for Defense Strategies**
| Defense Strategy | Match | Actions |
|------------------|-------|---------|
| High-Priority Control Traffic | Control flows | OutPort(x), ..., SetQueue(ID=highPriQueue) |
| Data Flows | Data flows | OutPort(x), ..., SetQueue(ID=lowPriQueue) |
| Proactive Bandwidth Reservation | Data flows | OutPort(x), ..., SetMeter(ID=RateLimit) |

**Table 2: SDN Switches with PQ or WRR Support**
| Brand | Model | Queue Support |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| Pica8 | All switches loaded with PicOS | √ PQ, √ WRR |
| Cisco | Catalyst 4500 Series Switches | × PQ, √ WRR |
| Brocade | NetIron XMR Series, MLX Series, CES 2000, CER 2000 Series | √ PQ, √ WRR |
| Dell | S4810, S4820T, S6000, Z9000, Z9500, MXL switches | √ PQ, √ WRR |
| Huawei | CloudEngine 8800 Series | √ PQ, √ WRR |
