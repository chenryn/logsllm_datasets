#### P-559: Automated Annotation of Untargeted LC-MS Metabolomics Data Using All-Ion LC-MS/MS and In-Silico Fragmentation Information
**Presenting Author**: Gonçalo Graça, Imperial College London, United Kingdom  
**Co-Authors**: Yuheng Cai, ChungHo Lau, Panagiotis Vorkas, Elizabeth J. Want, David Herrington, Timothy M. D. Ebbels

Untargeted metabolomics LC-MS experiments generate complex datasets with tens to hundreds of thousands of features (m/z-retention time pairs) from thousands of molecules. The annotation of these features is a significant bottleneck, even for known compounds, often requiring additional MS/MS experiments and expert knowledge of molecular fragmentation [1]. In all-ion LC-MS/MS schemes, such as alternated low and high collision energy acquisitions (MSe or MSall) and sequential window acquisition of all theoretical mass spectra (SWATH), provide MS fragmentation data at no additional experimental time cost [2]. However, reconstructing parent-fragment relationships is challenging, especially in wide fragmentation window experiments (MSe or MSall), which generate spectra composed of fragments from multiple parent ions.

In this work, we propose a novel approach for automated annotation of LC-MS using all-ion fragmentation data, combining correlation-based parent-fragment ion reconstruction with in-silico molecular fragmentation and retention-time information. This strategy correctly annotated 155 out of 207 features (75%) from XCMS outputs [3] in a set of human serum samples, corresponding to different isotopologues, adducts, and fragments from lipids and other small metabolites. This approach provides a useful framework for the annotation and interpretation of untargeted LC-MS metabolomics data and can be easily adapted to other samples and experimental settings. An R package, including dedicated visualization tools, is planned for release in the near future.

#### P-560: Facilitating Interpretation of Metabolomics Data Using KEGG and HMDB Databases
**Presenting Author**: Cédric Bovet, Bern University Hospital, Switzerland  
**Co-Authors**: Zhaoyue He, Stefan Zahnd, Katrin Freiburghaus, Carlo R. Largiadèr, Martin G. Fiedler

The annotation of metabolic ions and their assignment to pathways remains a major challenge in non-targeted metabolomics by high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). To gain confidence in annotations, laboratories often measure hundreds of metabolite standards and generate in-house spectral libraries. However, only a small proportion of detected ions are annotated using this strategy. To enhance the annotation of unknown ions, we developed R and Python packages to extract the most probable metabolites and chemical taxonomy (i.e., class, sub-class, etc.) from HMDB and KEGG databases based on measured m/z ratios. After tentative annotation of ions and pathways using Mummichog (http://mummichog.org/), our R package assigns the generated list of empirical compounds to the corresponding fold changes of the input file, downloads the corresponding KEGG maps, and generates a comprehensive overview of impaired metabolic pathways. Potentially identified metabolites are shown as nodes colored and sized according to their fold change and p-value, respectively. The Python package extracts potential metabolite identities for each measured m/z ratio and the chemical taxonomy from HMDB. An annotation tolerance for the taxonomy of interest can be specified, and the filtered annotation is used to reveal collectively regulated classes.

To test our approach, we reanalyzed a dataset obtained from male adults with type-1 diabetes undergoing exercises [1] and successfully annotated unknown ions and isolated regulated pathways (i.e., purines, steroids, and amino acids). Our approach facilitates the annotation of ions and the interpretation of complex non-targeted HRMS data.

#### P-561: A Novel UHPLC-MS Method for Global Profiling of Cholesteryl Esters and Potential Biomarkers Discovery in Hyperlipidemic Golden Hamsters
**Presenting Author**: Miao Lin, Institute of Materia Medica, CAMS & PUMC, China  
**Co-Authors**: Zhe Wang, Dongmei Wang, Xiong Chen, Jin-Lan Zhang

Cholesteryl esters (CEs) play crucial roles in cholesterol homeostasis, and abnormal levels of CEs result in various diseases, such as Wolman disease, hyperlipidemia, atherosclerosis, and cancer. Global profiling of CEs in biosamples would be beneficial for the discovery of disease biomarkers. In our study, we reported the global profiling of CEs in plasma and three different lipoproteins (VLDL, LDL, and HDL) of golden hamsters using a mathematical model-assisted ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS) method. Seventy-four CEs (50 newly reported CEs) were identified in golden hamsters with the validated mathematical strategy based on chromatographic retention behavior, structural features, and CE standards. Then, 74 CEs were quantified by dynamic multiple reaction monitoring (dMRM) for the discovery of potential biomarkers in hyperlipidemic golden hamsters. A total of 57, 52, 42, and 41 CEs were indicated as potential biomarkers in the plasma, VLDL, LDL, and HDL of hyperlipidemic golden hamsters, respectively. We found that 24 CEs were shared in plasma and lipoproteins. Additionally, 11 CEs were reported to be closely related to metabolic disorders and heart diseases, while 13 CEs were novel potential biomarkers of hyperlipidemia. Our study expands the scope of CE compound analysis in biosamples and can be applied for the discovery of biomarkers for human diseases.

#### P-562: Metabolomics Analysis in Rat Plasma During Short-Term Abstinence Following Methamphetamine Self-Administration
**Presenting Author**: Suji Kim, College of Pharmacy, Keimyung University, South Korea  
**Co-Authors**: Hyerim Yu, In Soo Ryu, Sooyeun Lee, Sangkil Lee

Drug addiction is a chronic, relapsing brain disease that is strengthened by a dynamic process of repeating drug reward and withdrawal. Drug withdrawal, usually starting within hours of the last dose, is a critical step in the transition from reward to addiction. Methamphetamine (MA) is a highly addictive central nervous system stimulant, and its abuse has become a serious global public health concern. In this study, a time-series metabolomics analysis was performed to uncover metabolic changes associated with MA short-term abstinence. Metabolic alterations were investigated in rat plasma collected immediately after 16 days of MA self-administration (SA) and after 12 and 24 hours of abstinence using both non-targeted UPLC-QTOF-ESI-MS and targeted MS of amino acids, biogenic amines, acylcarnitines, glycerophospholipids, and sphingolipids. Principal component analysis revealed the highest level of separation between the 24-hour and control groups from the UPLC-QTOF-ESI-MS data. We detected 358/445/453 and 521/618/584 significantly different ion features in the SA/12h/24h groups in positive and negative ESI, respectively, including 5-methylcytosine, deoxycytidine, glycocholate, nicotinamide, corticosterone, hydroxyisobutyric acid, linolenic acid, hippurate, 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)lactate, taurine, urate, and uridine. We also found that during the short-term abstinence from MA self-administration, the levels of many amino acids, biogenic amines, and glycerophospholipids were significantly altered. Specifically, distinct changes were observed in the metabolic pathways involved in energy metabolism, the nervous system, and membrane lipid metabolism. These findings provide essential knowledge of the dynamic metabolic effects associated with short-term MA abstinence and may help identify early warning signs of MA dependence.

#### P-563: Improved Metabolite Identification in a Single Injection with SWATH Acquisition for Untargeted Metabolomics Workflow
**Presenting Author**: Robert Proos, SCIEX, United States

Comprehensive metabolite identification with MS/MS library spectral matching can be problematic for data-dependent acquisition (DDA) workflows, as it often requires multiple injections for each sample. SWATH Acquisition, a Data Independent Acquisition (DIA) method, with optimized variable windows, provides a powerful workflow requiring only a single injection per sample for each polarity. In addition to capturing product ion spectra for all ionizing analytes, SWATH also offers the option of quantitation at either the MS or MS/MS level, allowing a comprehensive qualitative and quantitative analysis of metabolites in complex biological samples like plasma.

#### P-564: The GERSTEL Metabolomics Prepstation
**Presenting Author**: Nathan Hawkins, GERSTEL GmbH & Co. KG, Germany

Robust, reproducible sample preparation methods are fundamental to delivering high-quality metabolomics and metabolic phenotyping datasets. While the last decade has seen great improvements in instrumental precision, sensitivity, and robustness, most sample preparation is still done manually, which is a significant bottleneck to sample throughput and the principal source of experimental error. Some labs have automated sample preparation to reduce human error and improve analytical precision, but most laboratory robotics systems are either dedicated liquid handling systems or expensive bespoke systems designed and programmed to automate a single protocol in batches. Dedicated liquid handling robots have limited sample preparation capability (cannot automate evaporation, vortexing, centrifugation, and solid phase extraction), and bespoke systems lack the flexibility to modify the protocol to deal with different samples/matrices to meet changing laboratory needs or improve methods to meet quality or regulatory requirements. Furthermore, preparing samples in batches works for molecular biology and proteomics, but metabolites (or their derivatives) that are not stable are excluded during data pre-processing prior to statistical analysis. We have therefore developed a flexible, modular, user-configurable, and programmable Prepstation that can fully automate the most commonly used LC/LC-MS, GC/GC-MS, and NMR protocols for lipidomics, metabolomics, and metabolic phenotyping, including:
- The Fiehn Protocol (MOX-TMS)
- Biomedical research into inborn errors of metabolism (tBDMS)
- Amino Acid analysis as their Alkyl Chloroformates
- Metabolic phenotyping of microbial, plant, and animal FAMEs

The GERSTEL Metabolomics Prepstation can be configured for a wide range of metabolomics and lipidomics protocols, including those for commercially available kits.

#### P-565: Untargeted Metabolomics Application to Monitor Urine Samples by Ultra-High-Pressure Liquid Chromatography Coupled to High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry
**Presenting Author**: Csaba Laszlo, Philip Morris International, Switzerland  
**Co-Authors**: A. Haiduc, E. Dossin, F. de Jong, C. Beecher, A. Kamleh, P.A. Guy, N.V. Ivanov, M. Peitsch

To meet the demands of high-throughput metabolomics analysis, we established a urine sample preparation method on 96-well plates and an efficient liquid chromatography (LC) coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (MS) method using the latest model of the Vanquish™ Tandem LC system. The separation of urine metabolites was performed using two Hypersil GOLD™ C18 columns (150 x 2.1 mm, 1.9 µm) operating in parallel and running with a fast linear gradient of acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid, ramping from 5% to 95% in 10 minutes, alternating between the two columns. Dual-column operation with column reconditioning maintains full occupancy of the MS instrument (MS acquisition of column A during re-equilibration of column B). MS detection was realized on a Q Exactive™ HF mass spectrometer operating in positive and negative electrospray ionization acquisition modes. Data quality consistency was assessed through various pooled urine quality control samples injected on both columns processed by principal component analysis. To prevent possible drift in retention time across the columns, various reference index markers eluting across the gradient were analyzed at the beginning and end of the 96-well plate series on each column. Retention index values were calculated to provide reproducible results over time. Additionally, we assessed the 13C yeast extract (TruQuant IQQ Workflow Kit, IROA®) to obtain a more robust method for metabolite identification and quantification.

#### P-566: Electromembrane Extraction for the Analysis of Betaine, Carnitine, Choline, Deoxycarnitine, and TMAO in Plasma
**Presenting Author**: Drouin Nicolas, Leiden University, Netherlands  
**Co-Authors**: Amy Harms, Tim Kloots, Julie Schappler, Serge Rudaz, Isabelle Kohler, Petrus Wilhelmus Lindenburg, Thomas Hankemeier

Choline, trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), carnitine, deoxycarnitine, and betaine are routinely quantified as potential biomarkers of cardiovascular disease. The common analytical workflow typically relies on protein precipitation and flow injection combined with the use of deuterated internal standards for high-throughput analysis. However, this approach leads to significant matrix effects and up to an 80% sensitivity decrease due to the presence of salts and phospholipids. In this context, electromembrane extraction (EME) appears to be a promising alternative to selectively extract polar ionizable compounds from complex matrices such as plasma. In this study, EMEs were performed in parallel using an in-house Parallel-EME device, and experimental parameters were optimized. Nitrophenyl pentyl ether (NPPE) was selected as the supported liquid membrane based on the physico-chemical properties of the targeted compounds. Intrinsic parameters such as voltage and applied current, as well as sample composition (i.e., simple plasma dilution, MeOH addition, and protein precipitation), were evaluated. Optimal conditions, namely 400 μA/well, 1400 rpm, 15 min, and protein precipitation using trichloroacetic acid to reduce the ionic strength and buffer capacity of plasma, led to repeatable extraction with a process efficiency lower than 20%.

#### P-569: Micro-LC-MS Versus UHPLC-MS Analysis of Endocannabinoids in Cerebrospinal Fluid: The Potential Role of the Endocannabinoid System in Migraine Pathology
**Presenting Author**: Xinyu Di, LACDR, Netherlands  
**Co-Authors**: Faisa Guled, Elke Krekels, Isabelle Kohler, Thomas Hankemeier

Experimental and clinical data have suggested a link between migraine pathology and the endocannabinoid system (ECS). In this study, we aim to compare endocannabinoid levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma samples in migraine patients (N = 195) versus healthy controls (N = 94). The problem is that the concentration of several endocannabinoids in CSF is very low (sub-ng/mL range), lower than the limits of detection (LODs) offered by conventional UHPLC-MS techniques, highlighting the need for highly sensitive detection methods. To achieve this goal, a micro-LC-MS method has been developed and optimized for the targeted analysis of 17 endocannabinoids. The separation was performed using a micro Acquity HSS T3 column (0.3 × 100 mm, 1.8 μm) at a flow rate of 10 μL/min. An injection volume of 4 μL was applied by utilizing the enrichment function of the column. Electrospray ionization and selective Multiple Reaction Mode were used for data acquisition. The lower limits of quantification (LLOQs) obtained with the developed micro-LC-MS method were 5 to 10 times lower than the LLOQs obtained with state-of-the-art UHPLC-MS methods using the same mass analyzer. The developed method enabled the detection of the 17 targeted endocannabinoids in human CSF. This method will be applied to the analysis of migraine patient samples.

#### P-570: Balancing Quantitative and Qualitative LC-HRMS for Simultaneous Targeted and Non-Targeted Metabolomics
**Presenting Author**: Anne-Charlotte Dubbelman, Leiden University, Netherlands  
**Co-Authors**: Filip Cuyckens, Lieve Dillen, Rob J. Vreeken, Thomas Hankemeier

A typical trend in metabolomics is to do more for less. In mass spectrometry (MS), this induces a shift from using triple quadrupole MS for targeted and more quantitative metabolomics versus high-resolution MS (HRMS) for non-targeted metabolomics, towards using HRMS for both at the same time (Quan/Qual). Although theoretically attractive, practically, optimizing HRMS parameter settings for qualitative analysis can compromise the quantitative analysis and vice versa. Therefore, we investigated the often underestimated effect of selected HRMS parameter settings on the quantitative and qualitative performance. Human plasma was used for all evaluations, and a wide variety of drugs were spiked to optimize for (pharmaco-)metabolomics. On ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) coupled to quadrupole Time-of-Flight MS systems, we varied and evaluated the effects of varying the scan protocol, mass resolution, scan time, and smoothing on the measurements. It was found that, especially for high-throughput UHPLC, the scan time (cycle time) is critical in Quan/Qual analysis. A longer cycle time allows more elaborate qualitative scan protocols, e.g., including fragmentation without or after ion mobility separation, apart from just ToF-MS. However, a too long scan time (here already observed from 200 ms) resulted in the co-detection of chromatographically separated isomers. Using a Synapt G2S MS, the amount of qualitative information correlated negatively with the quantitative performance (precision, accuracy, linear dynamic range, sensitivity). To conclude, optimizing HRMS settings for simultaneous targeted and non-targeted metabolomics requires balancing parameter settings for quantitative and qualitative performance. This study resulted in recommendations to help future Quan/Qual LC-HRMS method development.

#### P-571: A Real-Time Metabolomics Profiling Approach Using Rapid Evaporative Ionization Mass Spectrometry (REIMS) to Classify Meat Samples
**Presenting Author**: Yann Guitton, Laberca, France  
**Co-Authors**: G. Dervilly-Pinel, S. Stead, B. Le Bizec

In recent years, the development of Ambient Mass Spectrometry (AMS) techniques has boomed. AMS techniques are convenient for high-throughput and complex sample analysis, as they allow the analyst to bypass long sample preparation steps and get "instantaneous" results. Among them, Rapid Evaporative Ionization Mass Spectrometry (REIMS) is promising for the classification of tissue samples. In short, samples are simply "burned," and the created aerosol is ionized and directly analyzed in full scan mode. On tissue samples, the REIMS-generated mass spectrometric profiles are dominated by lipids. This specificity is used to discriminate samples by their lipidic fingerprint. The combination of REIMS with an untargeted metabolomics workflow was investigated to identify carcasses from pigs treated with Ractopamine, a β-agonist substance used in some parts of the world as a growth promoter in livestock, although forbidden in many countries. The strategy was found successful when tested on different muscle types (loin, shoulder, and ham). Multi-variate statistical software package LiveIDTM (Waters) was used as a model builder and direct recognition tool. Classification performances were 0% false negative and 10% false positive, which fully meets the requirements of a screening strategy. REIMS implemented in an untargeted metabolomics workflow can be considered a high-throughput and powerful strategy for real-time meat classification in relation to Ractopamine treatment in pigs.

**Presenting Author**: Therese Koal, Biocrates Life Sciences AG, Austria  
**Co-Authors**: Hai Pham Tuan, Doreen Kirchberg, Barbara Wolf

Quantitative metabolite analysis of related biochemical pathways is of high interest for a better understanding of health and disease. Mass spectrometry is a key analytical technique presently used in metabolomics. Reliable analytical results and improved inter-laboratory comparability, automation, and standardization of a metabolomics workflow are of utmost importance to deliver translational data for next-gen metabolomics. Here, we present the standardized, quantitative AbsoluteIDQ® p180 kit-assay as a solution for metabolic phenotyping on an Agilent triple quadrupole LC/MS system, allowing the multiplexed and targeted analysis of up to 188 endogenous metabolites and lipids from six different key metabolite classes (21 amino acids, 21 biogenic amines, 40 acylcarnitines, hexoses, 15 sphingolipids, and 90 glycerophospholipids). The AbsoluteIDQ® p180 kit is applicable to a broad range of biological matrices (blood, tissue, cell culture, etc.) and species and requires only 10 µL of sample volume. An easy-to-use and rapid sample preparation protocol with a specially designed 96-well filter plate allows high-throughput analysis. The LC-MS/MS instrument consists of the 1290 Infinity II LC system coupled to a 6470 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. Automated data analysis of >22K MRM chromatograms from >230 metabolites and internal standards analyzed in 96 tests (blanks, QC, standards, and samples) was performed using Biocrates’ MetIDQ™ software, which automatically controls the entire workflow, from sample registration to data processing and result reporting. Analytical performance, including lower and upper limits of quantitation, intra- and inter-batch accuracy, and precision, will be presented. Additionally, a comparative study of common biofluids relevant for metabolomics will be shown.
