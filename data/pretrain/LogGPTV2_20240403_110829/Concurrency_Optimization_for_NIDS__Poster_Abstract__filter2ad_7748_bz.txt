Automated annotation of untargeted LC-MS metabolomics data using all-ion LC-MS/MS and in-silico fragmentation information
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Gonçalo Graça, Imperial College London, United Kingdom
CO-AUTHORS: Yuheng Cai, ChungHo Lau, Panagiotis Vorkas, Elizabeth J. Want, David Herrington, Timothy M. D. Ebbels
Untargeted metabolomics LC-MS experiments produce complex datasets containing tens to hundreds of thousands of features (m/z_retention 
time pairs) from thousands of molecules The annotation of such features is a bottleneck, even for known compounds, requiring additional MS/
MS experiments and expert knowledge of molecular fragmentation [1] In all-ion LC-MS/MS schemes such as alternated low and high collision 
energy acquisitions (MSe or MSall) and sequential window acquisition of all theoretical mass spectra (SWATH) provide MS fragmentation data at no 
additional experimental time cost [2] However, reconstruction of parent-fragment relationships is a difficult task, particularly for wide fragmentation 
windows experiments (MSe or MSall) which generate spectra composed of fragments from multiple parent ions In the presented work we propose 
a novel approach for automated annotation of LC-MS using all-ion fragmentation data, which combines correlation-based parent-fragment ion 
reconstruction with in-silico molecular fragmentation and retention-time information This strategy allowed the correct annotation of 155 of 207 
features (75%) from XCMS outputs [3] in a set of human serum samples These corresponded to different isotopologues, adducts and fragments 
from lipid and other small metabolites This approach provides a useful framework for the annotation and interpretation of untargeted LC-MS 
metabolomics data and can be easily adapted to other samples and experimental settings An R package, including dedicated visualisation tools, is 
planned to be released in the near future References: [1] Domingo-Almenara et al Anal Chem (2018), 90, 480−489 [2] Broeckling et al Anal Chem

Facilitating interpretation of metabolomics data using KEGG and HMDB databases
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Cédric Bovet, Bern University Hospital, Switzerland
CO-AUTHORS: Zhaoyue He, Stefan Zahnd, Katrin Freiburghaus, Carlo R. Largiadèr, Martin G. Fiedler
The annotation of metabolic ions and their assignment to pathways remains the main challenge in non-targeted metabolomics by high-resolution 
mass spectrometry (HRMS) To gain annotation confidence, laboratories are often measuring hundreds of metabolite standards and generate in-
house spectral libraries Usually, only a small proportion of the detected ions is annotated with this strategy To enhance the annotation of unknown 
ions, we developed R and Python packages to extract the most probable metabolites and chemical taxonomy (ie, class, sub-class, etc) from 
HMDB and KEGG databases based on measured m/z ratios After tentative annotation of ions and pathways using Mummichog (http://mummichog
org/), our developed R package assigns the generated list of empirical compounds to the corresponding fold changes of the input file, downloads 
the corresponding KEGG maps and generates a comprehensive overview of impaired metabolic pathways Potentially identified metabolites are 
shown as nodes colored and sized according to their fold change and p-value, respectively The Python package extracts the potential metabolite 
identities for each measured m/z ratio and the chemical taxonomy from HMDB An annotation tolerance for the taxonomy of interest can be 
specified and the filtrated annotation is used to reveal collectively regulated classes To test our approach, we reanalyzed a dataset obtained from 
male adults with type-1-diabetes undergoing exercises [1] and successfully annotated unknown ions and isolated regulated pathways (ie, purines, 
steroids and amino acids) In conclusion, our approach facilitates the annotation of ions and the interpretation of complex non-targeted HRMS data

A novel UHPLC-MS method for global profiling of cholesteryl esters and potential biomarkers discovery of hyperlipidemic 
golden hamsters
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Miao Lin, Institute of Materia Medica, CAMS & PUMC, China
CO-AUTHORS: Zhe Wang, Dongmei Wang, Xiong Chen, Jin-Lan Zhang
Cholesteryl esters (CEs) play crucial roles in cholesterol homeostasis, and abnormal levels of CEs result in various diseases, such as Wolman 
disease, hyperlipidemia, atherosclerosis, and cancer Global profiling of CEs in biosamples would be beneficial to the discovery of disease 
biomarkers In our study, we reported the global profiling of CEs in plasma and three different lipoproteins (VLDL, LDL, and HDL) of golden hamsters 
by a mathematical model-assisted ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS) method Seventy-four CEs (50 
newly reported CEs) were identified in golden hamster with the validated mathematical strategy based on the chromatographic retention behavior, 
structural features and CE standards Then, 74 CEs were quantified by dynamic multiple reaction monitoring (dMRM) for the discovery of potential 
biomarkers in hyperlipidemic golden hamsters A total of 57, 52, 42, and 41 CEs were indicated as potential biomarkers in the plasma, VLDL, LDL, 
and HDL of hyperlipidemic golden hamsters, respectively We found that 24 CEs were shared in plasma and lipoproteins And 11 CEs were reported 
to be closely related to metabolic disorders and heart diseases, while 13 CEs were novel potential biomarkers of hyperlipidemia Our study expands 
the scope of CE compound analysis in biosamples and can be applied for the discovery of biomarkers for human diseases

Metabolomics analysis in rat plasma during short-term abstinence following methamphetamine self-administration
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Suji Kim, College of Pharmacy, Keimyung University, South Korea
CO-AUTHORS: Suji Kim, Hyerim Yu, In Soo Ryu, Sooyeun Lee, Sangkil Lee
Drug addiction is a chronic, relapsing brain disease that is strengthened by a dynamic process of repeating drug reward and withdrawal Drug 
withdrawal, usually starting within hours of the last dose, is a critical step in the transition from reward to addiction Methamphetamine (MA) is a 
highly addictive central nervous system stimulant and its abuse has become a serious global public health concern In the present study, a time-
series metabolomics analysis was performed to uncover metabolic changes associated with MA short-term abstinence Metabolic alterations were 
investigated in rat plasma collected immediately after 16 d of MA self-administration (SA) and after 12 and 24 h of abstinence using both non-targeted 
UPLC-QTOF-ESI-MS and targeted MS of amino acids, biogenic amines, acylcarnitines, glycerophospholipids, and sphingolipids Principal component 
analysis revealed that the highest level of separation occurred between the 24 h and control groups from the UPLC-QTOF-ESI-MS data We detected 
358/445/453 and 521/618/584 significantly different ion features in the SA/12 h/24 h groups in positive and negative ESI, respectively, including 
5-methylcytosine, deoxycytidine, glycocholate, nicotinamide, corticosterone, hydroxyisobutyric acid, linolenic acid, hippurate, 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)
lactate, taurine, urate, and uridine We also found that, during the short-term abstinence from MA self-administration, the levels of many amino acids, 
biogenic amines, and glycerophospholipids were significantly altered Specifically, distinct changes were observed in the metabolic pathways involved 
in energy metabolism, the nervous system, and membrane lipid metabolism These findings provide essential knowledge of the dynamic metabolic 
effects associated with short-term MA abstinence and may help identify early warning signs of MA dependence

Improved Metabolite Identification in a Single Injection with SWATH Acquisition for Untargeted Metabolomics Workflow
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Robert Proos, SCIEX, United States
Comprehensive metabolite identification with MS/MS library spectral matching can be problematic for data dependent acquisition (DDA) workflows 
as it often requires multiple injections for each sample SWATH Acquisition, a Data Independent Acquisition (DIA) method, with optimized variable 
windows, provides a powerful workflow requiring only a single injection per sample for each polarity In addition to capturing product ion spectra 
for all ionizing analytes, SWATH also provides the option of quantitation at either the MS or MS/MS level allowing a comprehensive qualitative and 
quantitative analysis of metabolites in complex biological samples like plasma

The GERSTEL Metabolomics Prepstation
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Nathan Hawkins, GERSTEL GmbH & Co.KG, Germany
Robust, reproducible sample preparation methods are fundamental to the delivery of high-quality metabolomics and metabolic phenotyping 
datasets Whilst the last decade has seen great improvements in instrumental precision, sensitivity and robustness, most sample preparation is 
still done manually, and is a significant bottleneck to sample throughput and the principal source of experimental error Whilst some labs have 
automated sample preparation to reduce human error and improve analytical precision, most laboratory robotics systems are either dedicated liquid 
handling systems or expensive bespoke systems designed and programmed to automate a single protocol in batches Dedicated liquid handling 
robots have limited sample preparation capability (cannot automate evaporation, vortexing, centrifugation and solid phase extraction) and bespoke 
systems lack the flexibility to modify the protocol to deal with different samples/matrices to meet changing laboratory needs or improve methods to 
meet quality or regulatory requirements Furthermore, whilst preparing samples in batches works for molecular biology and proteomics, metabolites 
(or their derivatives) that are not stable are excluded during data pre-processing prior to statistical analysis We have therefore developed a 
flexible, modular, user-configurable and programmable Prepstation that can fully automate the most commonly used LC/LC-MS, GC/GC-MS and 
NMR protocols for lipidomics, metabolomics and metabolic phenotyping including: The Fiehn Protocol (MOX-TMS)Biomedical research into inborn 
errors or metabolism (tBDMS) Amino Acid analysis as their Alkyl ChloroformatesMetabolic phenotyping of microbial, plant, and animal FAMEs The 
GERSTEL Metabolomics Prepstation can be configured for a wide range of metabolomics and lipidomics protocols including those for commercially 
available kits

Untargeted metabolomics application to monitor urine samples by ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography coupled to 
high-resolution mass spectrometry
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Csaba Laszlo, Philip Morris International, Switzerland
CO-AUTHORS: A. Haiduc, E. Dossin, F. de Jong, C. Beecher, A. Kamleh, P.A. Guy, N.V. Ivanov, M. Peitsch
In order to meet the demands of high-throughput metabolomics analysis, we established urine sample preparation method on 96-well plates and 
an efficient liquid chromatography (LC) coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (MS) method using the latest model of the Vanquish™ Tandem 
LC system The separation of urine metabolites was performed using two Hypersil GOLD™ C18 columns (150 x 21 mm, 19 µm) operating in parallel 
and running with a fast linear gradient of acetonitrile containing 01% formic acid, ramping from 5% to 95% in 10 minutes, alternating between the 
two columns Dual-column operation with column reconditioning maintains full occupancy of the MS instrument (MS acquisition of column A during 
re-equilibration of column B) MS detection was realized on a Q Exactive™ HF mass spectrometer operating in positive and negative electrospray 
ionization acquisition modes Data quality consistency was assessed through various pooled urine quality control samples injected on both columns 
processed by principal component analysis In order to prevent possible drift in retention time across the columns, various reference index markers 
eluting across the gradient were analyzed at the beginning and the end of the 96-well plate series on each column Retention index values were 
calculated to provide reproducible results over time In addition, we have assessed the 13C yeast extract (TruQuant IQQ Workflow Kit, IROA®) to 
obtain a more robust method for metabolite identification and quantification

Electromembrane extraction for the analysis of betaine, carnitine, choline, deoxycarnitine and TMAO in plasma
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Drouin Nicolas, Leiden University, Netherlands
CO-AUTHORS: Amy Harms, Tim Kloots, Julie Schappler, Serge Rudaz, Isabelle Kohler, Petrus Wilhelmus Lindenburg, Thomas Hankemeier
Choline, trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), carnitine, deoxycarnitine and betaine are now routinely quantified as potential biomarkers of 
cardiovascular disease The common analytical workflow typically relies on protein precipitation and flow injection combined with the use of 
deuterated internal standards for high-throughput analysis However, this approach leads to significant matrix effects and up to a 80% sensitivity 
decrease due to the presence of salts and phospholipids In this context, electromembrane extraction (EME) appears to be a promising alternative 
to selectively extract polar ionizable compounds from complex matrices such as plasma In this study, EMEs were performed in parallel using an 
in house Parallel-EME device and experimental parameters were optimized Nitrophenyl pentyl ether (NPPE) was selected as supported liquid 
membrane based on the physico-chemical properties of the targeted compounds Intrinsic parameters such as voltage and or applied current 
evaluated as well as sample composition (ie, simple plasma dilution, MeOH addition, and protein precipitation) were Optimal conditions, namely 
400 μA/well, 1400 rpm, 15 min, protein precipitation using trichloroacetic acid to reduce the ionic strength and the buffer capacity of plasma, lead 
to repeatable extraction as the observed process efficiency as lower than 20%, and further improved to 099) with the QQQ, while only 29% with 
the HRMS Selected pathway coverage was improved up to 3-fold by the QQQ: 62% metabolite coverage of purine metabolism and 33% coverage of 
citric acid cycle were achieved Our screening strategy enhanced metabolic profiling in serum of T1D patients by combining the benefits of unbiased 
full-scan HRMS acquisition with extended insights into specific pathways by QQQ analysis

Micro-LC-MS versus UHPLC-MS analysis of endocannabinoids in cerebrospinal fluid: the potential role of the 
endocannabinoid system in migraine pathology
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Xinyu Di, LACDR, Netherlands
CO-AUTHORS: Faisa Guled, Elke Krekels, Isabelle Kohler, Thomas Hankemeier.
Experimental and clinical data have suggested a link between migraine pathology and the endocannabinoid system (ECS) In this study, we aim to 
compare endocannabinoid levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma samples in migraine patients (N = 195) versus healthy controls (N = 94) 
The problem here is, the concentration of several endocannabinoids in CSF is very low (sub-ng/mL range), lower than the limits of detection (LODs) 
offered by conventional UHPLC-MS techniques, which highlights the need for highly sensitive detection methods To achieve this goal, a micro-
LC-MS method has been developed and optimized for the targeted analysis of 17 endocannabinoids The separation was performed using a micro 
Acquity HSS T3 column (03 × 100 mm, 18 μm) at a flow rate of 10 μL/min An injection volume of 4uL is applied by utilizing the enrichment function 
of the column Electrospray ionization and selective Multiple Reaction Mode was used for data acquisition The lower limits of quantification (LLOQs) 
obtained with the developed micro-LC-MS method were 5 to 10 times lower than the LLOQs obtained with state-of-the-art UHPLC-MS method using 
the same mass analyzer The developed method enabled the detection of the 17 targeted endocannabinoids in human CSF This method will be 
applied to the analysis of migraine patient samples

Balancing quantitative and qualitative LC-HRMS for simultaneous targeted and non-targeted metabolomics
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Anne-Charlotte Dubbelman, Leiden University, Netherlands
CO-AUTHORS: Filip Cuyckens, Lieve Dillen, Rob J. Vreeken, Thomas Hankemeier
A typical trend in metabolomics is to do more for less In mass spectrometry (MS), this induces the shift from using triple quadrupole MS for targeted 
and more quantitative metabolomics versus high-resolution MS (HRMS) for non-targeted metabolomics, towards using HRMS for both at the 
same time (Quan/Qual) Although theoretically attractive, practically, optimizing HRMS parameter settings for qualitative analysis can compromise 
the quantitative analysis and vice versa Therefore, we investigated the often underestimated effect of selected HRMS parameter settings on 
the quantitative and qualitative performance Human plasma was used for all evaluations and a wide variety of drugs was spiked to optimize for 
(pharmaco-)metabolomics On ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) coupled to quadrupole Time-of-Flight MS systems, we varied 
and evaluated the effects of varying the scan protocol, mass resolution, scan time and smoothing on the measurements It was found that especially 
for high-throughput UHPLC, the scan time (cycle time) is critical in Quan/Qual analysis A longer cycle time allows more elaborated qualitative scan 
protocols, eg including fragmentation without or after ion mobility separation, apart from just ToF-MS However, a too long scan time (here already 
observed from 200 ms) resulted in the co-detection of chromatographically separated isomers Using a Synapt G2S MS, the amount of qualitative 
information correlated negatively with the quantitative performance (precision, accuracy, linear dynamic range, sensitivity) To conclude, optimizing 
HRMS settings for simultaneous targeted and nontargeted metabolomics requires balancing parameter settings for quantitative and qualitative 
performance This study resulted in recommendations to help future Quan/Qual LC-HRMS method development

A REAL TIME METABOLOMICS PROFILING APPROACH USING RAPID EVAPORATIVE IONIZATION MASS SPECTROMETRY 
(REIMS) TO CLASSIFY MEAT SAMPLES
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Yann Guitton, Laberca, France
CO-AUTHORS: G. DERVILLY-PINEL, S. STEAD, B. LE BIZEC
In recent years the development of Ambient Mass Spectrometry (AMS) techniques has boomed AMS technics are convenient when it comes 
to high-throughput and complex samples analysis, as it allows the analyst to bypass long sample preparation steps and gets “instantaneous” 
results Among them, Rapid Evaporative Ionization Mass Spectrometry (REIMS) is promising for classification of tissue samples In short, samples 
are simply “burned” and the created aerosol is ionised and directly analysed in full scan mode On tissue samples, the REIMS generated mass 
spectrometric profiles are dominated by lipids That specificity is used to discriminate samples by their lipidic fingerprint The combination of REIMS 
with untargeted metabolomics workflow was investigated to identify carcasses from pig treated animals on the basis of a modification of indirect 
metabolites profile due to the use of Ractopamine, a β-agonist substance that may be used in some parts of the world as growth promoter in 
livestock, although forbidden in a number of countries The strategy was found successful when tested on different muscle types (loin, shoulder 
and ham) Multi-variate statistical software package LiveIDTM (Waters) was used as a model builder and direct recognition tool Classification 
performances were 0% false negative and 10 % false positive, which fully answers requirements of a screening strategy REIMS implemented in an 
untargeted-metabolomics workflow can be considered as a high-throughput and powerful strategy for real-time meat classification in relation to 
Ractopamine treatment in pig [1] Guitton et al DOI: 101080/1944004920171421778 *: Corresponding author: e-mail: laberca@oniris-nantesfr

PRESENTING AUTHOR: Therese Koal, Biocrates Life Sciences AG, Austria
CO-AUTHORS: Hai Pham Tuan, Doreen Kirchberg, Barbara Wolf
Quantitative metabolite analysis of related biochemical pathways is of high interest for a better understanding of health and disease Mass 
spectrometry is a key analytical technique presently used in metabolomics Reliable analytical results and improved inter-laboratory comparability, 
automation, and standardization of a metabolomics workflow is of utmost importance to deliver translational data for next-gen metabolomics Here, 
we present the standardized, quantitative AbsoluteIDQ® p180 kit-assay as a solution for metabolic phenotyping on an Agilent triple quadrupole 
LC/MS system allowing the multiplexed and targeted analysis of up to 188 endogenous metabolites and lipids from six different key metabolite 
classes (21 amino acids, 21 biogenic amines, 40 acylcarnitines, hexoses, 15 sphingolipids, and 90 glycerophospholipids) The AbsoluteIDQ® p180 
kit is applicable to a broad range of biological matrices (blood, tissue, cell culture etc) and species and requires only 10 µL of sample volume An 
easy-to-use and rapid sample preparation protocol with a specially designed 96-well filter plate allows high-throughput analysis The LC-MS/MS 
instrument consists of the 1290 Infinity II LC system coupled to a 6470 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer Automated data analysis of >22K MRM 
chromatograms from >230 metabolites and internal standards analyzed in 96 tests (blanks, QC, standards, and samples) was performed using 
Biocrates’ MetIDQ™ software, which automatically controls the entire workflow, from sample registration to data processing and result reporting 
Analytical performance, including lower and upper limits of quantitation, intra- and inter-batch accuracy, and precision will be presented In addition, 
a comparative study of common biofluids relevant for metabolomics will be shown
