### MTD Framework: Existing Work and Our Focus

Previous research on Moving Target Defense (MTD) has primarily focused on the strategic and outcome aspects of security. In contrast, our work aims to identify the most effective MTD techniques based on the results of security analysis using Attack Representation Models (ARMs). 

- **Zhuang et al. [2]** introduced an MTD system that proactively changes network configurations. They compared a simple MTD system (random adaptations) with an intelligent MTD system (adaptations based on attack detection alerts) in [3]. Their primary focus was to determine the optimal frequency for applying MTD techniques, without assessing the security implications of these assignments.
  
- **Manadhata [4]** proposed a two-player stochastic game model to determine an optimal MTD strategy, including a method to quantify the shift in the attack surface. The goal was to reduce the attack surface by balancing security and usability, but the effectiveness of specific MTD techniques was not considered.

- **Crouse et al. [5]** used a Genetic Algorithm to find temporally and spatially diverse configurations, which increased spatial diversity and reduced vulnerability scores. However, they did not perform a proper security assessment (e.g., using ARMs) to ensure the security of these configurations.

- **Evans et al. [6]** classified diversity MTD techniques (e.g., address, instruction set, and data randomization) with respect to different types of attack strategies. However, their work did not account for specific network configurations.

### MTD Applications

A wide range of applications utilize MTD frameworks, including:
- **Self-shielding Dynamic Network Architecture (SDNA) [7]**
- **Security layer (diversity on cryptosystems) and physical layer (diversity on firmware) of networked systems [8]**
- **Advanced Adaptive Applications environment [9]**

### MTD Techniques

MTD techniques can be deployed across various layers of a networked system, as shown in Table IV, and they can enhance the MTD framework. However, previous studies have not thoroughly evaluated the effectiveness of these schemes. We list some recent MTD techniques, whose effectiveness can be measured using our proposed approach.

#### Shuffle
Shuffle-based MTD techniques rearrange system settings in different layers:
- **TCP/IP Layer**: Jafarian et al. [10] demonstrated changing IP addresses in a Software-Defined Network (SDN) to maximize unpredictability and mutation rate. Antonatos et al. [11] shuffled IP addresses to harden networks against Hitlist Worms.
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Danev et al. [12] used VM live migration in private clouds, focusing on software integrity before migration. Zhang et al. [13] considered VM live migration in clouds, emphasizing practicability in terms of availability and duration. Okhravi et al. [14] explored environment migration, such as migrating applications to new hosts with different operating systems.
- **Application Layer**: Vikram et al. [15] randomized HTML elements to mitigate web bots. Jia et al. [16] provided secure service access by relocating secret proxies and shuffling client-to-proxy assignments.

#### Diversity
Diversity-based MTD techniques maintain equivalent functionalities but vary in implementation across different layers:
- **Topology Layer**: Rohrer et al. [17] formalized path diversity metrics (e.g., reliability and resilience) and proposed a path diversification selection algorithm. Newell et al. [18] assigned diversity to nodes to increase attack path diversity, solving the diversity assignment problem (DAP) and computing optimal solutions for medium-sized networks, with a greedy approximation for large networks.
- **Application Layer**: Glynis et al. [19] applied diversity to active software components to continuously change their implementation versions and resources. Jackson et al. [20] used compiler-based software diversity techniques to create multiple functionally equivalent but internally different program variants. Huang et al. [21] created virtual servers with unique software mixes. Nguyen et al. [22] used data diversity to increase the difficulty for attackers. Williams et al. [23] applied data diversity to VMs. Cox et al. [24] used address space partitioning and instruction set tagging as examples of diversity.

#### Redundancy
Redundancy techniques involve creating multiple replications of nodes or services to enhance availability, such as software redundancy [25]. However, this paper focuses on more specific attacks, namely Shuffle and Diversity.

### Security Modeling and Analysis

Many studies have attempted to demonstrate the effectiveness of MTD techniques. However, existing studies have not used ARMs to analyze security, making it difficult to compare different MTD techniques. In large networked systems, not all components can be secured due to constraints and limited resources. 

In this paper, we incorporate MTD techniques into security modeling and analysis using the Hierarchical Attack Representation Model (HARM). We analyze the security of Shuffle and Diversity, comparing their effectiveness to support security decisions. Additionally, we propose using Importance Measures (IMs) [38], [39] to deploy MTD techniques on critical nodes, where Node Centrality Measures (NCMs) are used to rank important hosts and security metrics to rank important vulnerabilities in a host (e.g., CVSS Base Score). 

Our results show that security analysis and deploying MTD techniques using IMs and the Exhaustive Search (ES) method are nearly equivalent, with significantly improved performance in terms of time. However, we only considered changes in the networked system from deploying MTD techniques. Other factors in virtualized systems can also cause updates, complicating security analysis. Future work will address these complex scenarios.

### Conclusion

Moving Target Defense (MTD) is a promising network defense strategy that has been studied recently. MTD techniques aim to thwart attacks by continuously changing the attack surface of a system. Various MTD techniques have been proposed to enhance security, but they often lack a formal security analysis to determine their effectiveness. Additionally, only a subset of MTD techniques may be applicable due to constraints, making it challenging to decide how to deploy them effectively in large networked systems.

In this paper, we incorporated two MTD techniques, Shuffle and Diversity, into security modeling and analysis using HARM. We provided a formal security analysis of these techniques and compared their effectiveness in various scenarios. We also used IMs to select highly important nodes in the networked system (e.g., hosts and vulnerabilities) for MTD deployment, demonstrating the effectiveness of IMs through simulations.
