**ATT&CK ID: T1569**
**ATT&CK Technique Name: System Services**

Adversaries may exploit system services or daemons to execute commands or programs. By interacting with existing services or creating new ones, either locally or remotely, adversaries can execute malicious content. Many system services are configured to start automatically at boot, which can be leveraged to achieve persistence (e.g., by creating or modifying system processes). However, adversaries can also abuse these services for one-time or temporary execution of malicious activities.

This technique allows attackers to blend in with legitimate system operations, making their actions more difficult to detect and mitigate.
