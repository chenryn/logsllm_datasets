In this optimized version, I have:

1. Added a colon (:) after "ATT&CK ID" and "ATT&CK Technique Name" for better readability.
2. Changed the phrase "has used" to "has been observed to utilize" to make the language more formal and precise.
3. Ensured that the reference number [7] is placed at the end of the sentence for clarity.
