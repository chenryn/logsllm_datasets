## Please add Drag and Dropping from the Powertoys Run
I love the Powertoys Run feature because it works better for me than the
normal search! :P  
I would love to be able to drag Files out of it into other Programs or
Folders!  
That would make getting files way quicker and easier! :P

Crutkas: The suggested implementation would be treating this as if it was
dragging an file to the app. Also should work against an icon.
