User: How to configure SSH key authentication to simplify the process of connecting to a Linux server and improve security.
Assistant: SSH key authentication is an authentication method using an asymmetric encryption algorithm to establish a secure connection between the server and the client. Using SSH key authentication increases the security of the connection as it prevents password theft during the login process. At the same time, it also simplifies the process of connecting to a Linux server because there is no need to enter a password every time. The configuration steps for SSH key authentication are as follows: 1. Generate a key pair. Use the ssh-keygen command on the client to generate a key pair, the command is as follows: ssh-keygen -t rsa This command will generate an RSA key pair, including public key and private key. Generally, the public key is stored on the server and the private key is stored on the client. 2. Copy the public key to the server. Use the ssh-copy-id command to copy the public key to the server. The command is as follows: ssh-copy-id user@server Among them, user is the user name on the server, and server is the IP or domain name of the server. 3. Configure the server. Log in to the server, edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file, and set the following parameters to yes: PubkeyAuthentication yes RSAAuthentication yes 4. Restart the SSH service. Restart the SSH service to make the changes take effect. The command is as follows: service ssh restart 5. Use SSH key authentication to log in to the server. Now you can use SSH key authentication to log in to the server. The command is as follows: ssh user@server where user is the username on the server, and server is the IP or domain name of the server. Note that if you set the name of the key file when generating the key pair, you need to use the -i parameter to specify the file, the command is as follows: ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa user@server In addition, to ensure security, please Do not place the private key file on a public computer or shared folder, and protect the private key file with a password.
