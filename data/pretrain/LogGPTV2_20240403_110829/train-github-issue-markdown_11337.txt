### Issue Submission

I have thoroughly searched the issues and FAQs of this repository and confirmed that this issue is not a duplicate.

### Environment
- Dubbo version: 2.6.6
- Operating System: MacOS 10.14.3
- Java version: 1.8.0_151

### Steps to Reproduce the Issue
1. Execute the `sh bin/start.sh` command.

### Expected Result
The Dubbo service should start successfully without any errors.

### Actual Result
When running the `sh bin/start.sh` command, the following error messages are displayed:
```
sh: bin/start.sh: No such file or directory
sh: 7: No such file or directory
sh: 13: No such file or directory
bin/start.sh: line 93: syntax error: unexpected end of file
```

These errors indicate that the script either cannot be found, or there is a syntax error in the script preventing it from executing properly.
