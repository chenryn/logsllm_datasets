APPENDIX
A. PROOFS
In this section we present the proofs of the lemmas and the-
orems omitted from the main body of the paper. First we
prove Lemma 1, which was used in the proof of Theorem 1.
Next, we present and prove Lemma 2, which then used to
prove Theorem 3. The proof of Theorem 4 is nearly identi-
cal, and thus omitted.
Proof. (Lemma 1.) We need to prove that all 3 condi-
tions of Deﬁnition 10 hold.
1. ∀A ∈ Vcor, ∀Bcast(A; t; m) ∈ θ(cid:48), Bcast(m) ∈ P(θ(cid:48)|A,t)
Take any event Bcast(A; t; m) ∈ θ(cid:48). Based on Condi-
tion 6.1, it holds that Bcast(t; m) ∈ θ(cid:48)|A = θ|A. Using
Condition 6.1 again, we get that Bcast(A; t; m) ∈ θ.
Since θ is feasible with respect to T-protocol model P,
Condition 10.1 gives us Bcast(m) ∈ P(θ|A,t). Using
again the assumption θ(cid:48)|A = θ|A we get the desired
Bcast(m) ∈ P(θ(cid:48)|A,t).
Neighbor(B, t(cid:48)) ∈ P(θ(cid:48)|A,t)
The proof is identical as for Condition 1.
 ∈ P(θ(cid:48)|A,t), where
2. ∀A ∈ Vcor, ∀Neighbor(A; t; B, t(cid:48)) ∈ θ(cid:48),
3. ∀A ∈ Vcor, ∀t ∈ X(cid:48)
A,
A = R(cid:62)0 \ start(θ(cid:48)|A ∩ E),
X(cid:48)
{Neighbor(t; B, t(cid:48)) | B ∈ V, t, t(cid:48) ∈ R(cid:62)0}.
E = {Bcast(t; m) | m ∈ M, t ∈ R(cid:62)0} ∪
As θ satisﬁes Condition 10.3, we have ∀t ∈ XA,
 ∈ P(θ|A,t), where XA = R(cid:62)0 \ start(θ|A ∩ E). Since
θ(cid:48)|A = θ|A, we have X(cid:48)
A = XA and P(θ(cid:48)|A,t) = P(θ|A,t),
which implies that θ(cid:48) satisﬁes Condition 3.
Lemma 2. For every trace θ feasible with respect to the
adversary model AT
∆relay and some setting S it holds:
∀A ∈ Vadv, ∀Dcast(A; t1; α, β, authB(t)) ∈ θ,
(B ∈ Vadv) ∨ (∃C ∈ Vcor, ∃δ (cid:62) ∆relay + dist(C,A)
Bcast(C; t1 − δ; authB(t)) ∈ θ)
vadv
,
Proof. The 1st disjunct (B ∈ Vadv) follows immediately
from 17.2, so we assume that B ∈ Vcor and focus on the
2nd disjunct. We prove it by contradiction: assume that
Dcast(A; t1; α, β, authB(t)) ∈ θ, but Bcast(C; t; authB(t)) /∈
θ, for any correct C and and τ (cid:54) t1 − ∆relay − dist(C,A)
((cid:63)).
vadv
We use the following reasoning: Apply 17.2 to obtain
Receive(D; t1 − δ; E, authB(t)) ∈ θ), where δ (cid:62) ∆relay +
dist(D,A)
vadv
. Next, apply 4.1 to get
v
; α(cid:48), β(cid:48), authB(t)) ∈ θ; the other
Dcast(E; t1 − δ − dist(E,D)
disjunct of 4.1 is ruled out by 17.1, assumption ((cid:63)) and
vadv (cid:62) v, as dist(D,A)
. This reasoning
can be repeated recursively, showing an inﬁnite number of
events in θ with start time below t1. This gives a contradic-
tion with the ﬁnite cut condition.
(cid:62) dist(E,A)
+ dist(E,D)
vadv
vadv
v
Proof. (Theorem 3.) First, we prove ND1, which is re-
peated below for readers convenience:
ND1 ∀S ∈ Σ, ∀θ ∈ ΘS,P,A, ∀A, B ∈ Vcor,
Neighbor(A; t; B, t(cid:48)) ∈ θ =⇒ t(cid:48) :: B→A
Consider a setting S and a trace θ ∈ ΘS,P T,AT
such that
Neighbor(A; t0; B, t1) ∈ θ, where A, B ∈ Vcor. We want to
show that t1 :: B→A.
∆relay
First, as A is correct, we can apply 16.2 and get
Receive(A; t1; C1, authB(t)) ∈ θ, where t1 + |authB(t)|  t + R
Next, consider case (b). We can apply Lemma 2, to obtain
Bcast(D; t1−δ1−δ2; authB(t)) ∈ θ, where δ2 > ∆relay. Refer
to 16.1 to get D = B and t = t1 − δ1 − δ2  0, ∀S ∈ Σ, ∀A, B ∈ Vcor, ∀t1, t2 (cid:62) 0,
(t2− t1 (cid:62) T ∧ [t1, t2] :: B→A ∧ dist(A, B) (cid:54) R) =⇒
(∃θ ∈ ΘS,P,A, ∃t(cid:48) ∈ [t1, t2],
Neighbor(A; t; B, t(cid:48)) ∈ θ)
Let T = sup{|authA(t)||A ∈ V, t ∈ R(cid:62)0} (we assume it
is ﬁnite). Consider a setting S, where nodes A, B ∈ Vcor,
dist(A, B) = d (cid:54) R and [t1, t2] :: A↔B, where t2 − t1 (cid:62) T .
Denote t0 = t1 − d
v . Obviously, the following trace satisﬁes
Neighbor(A; t; B, t(cid:48)) ∈ θ, for t(cid:48) = t1 and t = t1+|authB(t0)|+
1:
˘
θ =
Bcast(B; t0; authB(t0)),
Receive(A; t1; B, authB(t0)),
Neighbor(A; t1 + |authB(t0)| + 1; B, t1)
¯
It suﬃces to show this trace is feasible; this is easy to check
with respect to the setting S and trivial with respect to the
adversary model. Trace θ is also feasible with respect to the
T-protocol model P T: Condition 16.1 is obviously satisﬁed,
and Condition 16.2 follows from d
v (cid:54) R
v .
