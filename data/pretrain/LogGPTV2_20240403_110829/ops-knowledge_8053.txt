User: I'm just starting out with Python, and have found out that I can import various libraries. How do I find out what libraries exist on my Mac that I can import? How do I find out what functions they include?
I seem to remember using some web server type thing to browse through local help files, but I may have imagined that!
Assistant: On Leopard, depending on the python package you're using and the version number, the modules can be found in /Library/Python:
/Library/Python/2.5/site-packages
or in /Library/Frameworks
/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/lib/python2.6/site-packages
(it could also be 3.0 or whatever version)...
I guess it is quite the same with Tiger
