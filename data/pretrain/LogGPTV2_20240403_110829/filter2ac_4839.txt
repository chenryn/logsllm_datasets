### Title: Blackhat EU-22 {JS-ON: Security-OFF}: Exploiting JSON-Based SQL Queries

In recent years, major SQL-based database engines such as PostgreSQL, SQLite, Microsoft SQL Server, and MySQL have introduced native JSON features. These features enable complex data interactions with JSON-type objects, which are often enabled by default. However, developers and security researchers may not fully appreciate the risks associated with these new capabilities.

To explore these risks, we conducted a comprehensive study to determine whether these native JSON features can be exploited. Our findings reveal that the integration of native JSON has created a new and fertile ground for security research. This new landscape allows attackers to bypass web application firewalls (WAFs), exploit object-relational mappings (ORMs), and even circumvent prepared statements.

In this presentation, we will delve into the world of JSON in SQL, introducing you to its new operators (such as "?&" and "#>>"), syntax, and novel SQL injection payloads. We will demonstrate how these new features can be abused to create vulnerabilities in popular applications, libraries, and ORMs.

Our research uncovered a generic WAF bypass technique that affects major WAF providers, including Amazon AWS, Palo Alto, Cloudflare, F5, and others. To share our findings, we will provide a Git repository containing the results of our research, newly developed JSON SQL injection payloads, and a tool for exploiting this new attack vector.

Join us to learn about the potential risks and how to mitigate them, ensuring your applications remain secure in the face of these emerging threats.
