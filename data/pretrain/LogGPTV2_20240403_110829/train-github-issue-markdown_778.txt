In Bootstrap 3.2.0 it is at the moment possible to have more accordion items
at once open. But normally only entry should be open.
How i made this:
  1. Normal Click on accordion item "`Collapsible Group Item #3`"
  2. Fast Click on accordion item "`Collapsible Group Item #2`"
  3. Fast Click on accordion item "`Collapsible Group Item #1`" (as soon as possible after step 2))
Result (Image below -> two open accordion items):
