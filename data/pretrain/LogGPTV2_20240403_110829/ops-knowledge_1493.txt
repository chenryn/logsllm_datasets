User: How do I get IPython to notify me when a command has been executed? Can I get it to use the bell/alert, or by pop-up? I'm running Anaconda on iTerm on OS X 10.8.5.
Assistant: Recent versions of iTerm send notifications to notification center when there is output in a non-visible tab. They fold into notification center by default, but you can change them to stay on the screen in the Notifications preferences in System Preferences.
