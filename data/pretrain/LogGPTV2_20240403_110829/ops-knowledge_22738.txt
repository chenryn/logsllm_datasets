User: I've been using Python3.4 to complete certain tasks, though I still use Python2.7 as default. 
I think I should be able to begin downloading py34 ports from using sudo port install py34-whatever in the same location as my Python2.7 ports. 
However, I am running into significant downloading errors doing this. 
Is it possible to download both py27 and py34 ports into the same location? Will there be problems doing this?
Assistant: Your problems appear to be a generic Macports download problem. Resetting the download process via sudo port clean <portname> should help.
As to the general question of using multiple versions:
Macports allows you to install an arbitrary number of different versions in parallel. You switch between them using port select --set <application> <portname>, for example sudo port select --set python python34.
For easier access, you can define your own shell alias (e.g. python3 or python34), pointing to /opt/local/bin/python34.
