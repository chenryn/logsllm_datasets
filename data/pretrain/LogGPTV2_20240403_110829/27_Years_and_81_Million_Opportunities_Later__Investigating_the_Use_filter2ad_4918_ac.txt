### Risks to Individuals and Data Protection Measures

We concur with the assessment that answering our research questions is beneficial for future end-to-end encryption research, ultimately benefiting society. Importantly, no harm was done to any participants based on potentially re-identifiable metadata. We will not publish the collected metadata; only an encrypted copy will be stored at the university data center for ten years, without access by researchers, to adhere to good scientific practice. As is standard in research, we will only publish aggregate data, ensuring that no email accounts can be re-identified through the publication of this paper.

As part of the joint development of our data collection plan, we implemented the following measures to protect users' privacy and comply with GDPR, German, and state laws:

- **Access Control**: The involved researchers never had access to raw data. The data collection pipeline was executed by the university’s IT staff, who operate the email servers and have access to backup data. They transferred pseudonymized data to the researchers via a secure server.
- **Data Minimization**: We reduced the amount of data to the absolute minimum required to investigate our research questions.
- **Pseudonymization**: We used cryptographically secure hash functions with salts unavailable to the researchers to pseudonymize user data.
- **Secure Storage**: Pseudonymized data (refer to Table IV in the appendix) was stored exclusively on secured university servers.
- **Data Sharing**: We did not and will not share any data other than the aggregate numbers in the paper with anyone outside the team of involved researchers.
- **Non-De-identification**: We assured the data protection officer and the works committee that we would not take any actions to de-identify users.

These data protection precautions ensured a necessary balance between user privacy and data utility, enabling us to perform the analyses reported in Section V.

### Limitations

#### Data Set
Our dataset includes email data from January 1994 to July 2021, covering 81,647,559 emails from 37,463 users at a large German university with over 30,000 students and 5,000 employees. However, the dataset may not be complete, as it does not include emails deleted by users or sent to deleted accounts. Additionally, some research groups and departments use their own email servers, and their emails were not included. Therefore, the dataset should not be assumed to encompass all emails sent or received during the specified period. Furthermore, we do not assume that our dataset is representative of all email data in Germany or globally. Our dataset might overreport the use of email encryption, as most users are highly educated, and the university offers free S/MIME certificates to all email users.

Despite these limitations, we believe our dataset is one of the largest and most valuable for the type of analysis we perform, and our results provide a significant contribution to the security research community.

#### Data Analysis
We could not analyze all cryptographic details, such as verifying digital signatures, because we were not allowed to parse the body content of emails. We also could not extract details for certificates or signatures used in encrypted emails, as this data is also encrypted.

Our pipeline was thoroughly tested but still missed some edge cases, which are inevitable in mail software that evolves over a long time span. Our pipeline processed 99.91% of all emails, with processing failing for the remaining 0.09%. Errors during S/MIME and PGP parsing were logged separately. We encountered 1,199 S/MIME and 23,168 PGP emails where parsing failed (see Appendix A for more details). We deemed this margin of error acceptable compared to the high organizational costs of refining and repeating the entire process.

#### Distinction Between Sent and Received Emails
The dataset did not contain information on whether an email was sent or received. Grouping emails based on the folder they were stored in would introduce challenges, such as different names for sent folders or users using their own folder names. Therefore, we identified emails based on multiple parameters. Sent emails were not allowed to contain a return_path header, as it is added by outgoing mail servers, and emails were only allowed to go through at most one mail relay. Most incoming emails have more than five email relays.

#### Mail Client Behavior
The macOS and iOS clients Apple-Mail, iPhoneMail, and iPadMail generally identify themselves using the X-Mailer header in emails, but the copy placed in the sent folder by these clients does not contain this header. As a result, these clients could only be correctly detected on received emails, and their sent mails are included in the "No User Agent" group. The ticket system used by the university data center automatically deletes mails in its inbox and does not place a copy in the sent folder, so only answered tickets are available in our dataset.

### Replication Package
To improve the replicability of our work, we provide a replication package including:
- The complete processing pipeline consisting of multiple Python scripts to process and pseudonymize emails from Dovecot mail servers.
- The analysis scripts to replicate our results on different datasets.
- The agreement with our data protection officer.

Due to the sensitive nature of our measurement study, we cannot make raw email data available. We hope this replication package helps future studies to better compare and position themselves relative to our work and encourage others to replicate our work on different email datasets to enhance our community's understanding of email encryption. The replication package is available on our website at [39].

### Results

#### Dataset Summary
We analyzed metadata for 81,647,559 emails from 37,089 email accounts. Overall, the university’s email users exchanged 40,540,140 (49.67%) emails internally.

Figure 2 illustrates the use of email at our university over the past 27 years. While we found only 350 emails in 1994, we detected an almost exponential growth, reaching 17,190,472 emails in 2020. This reflects the enormous relevance of email as a communication tool and aligns with reports on global email usage.

**Use of Email Encryption and Signatures:**
- 2,334,042 (2.86%) emails were either encrypted or signed using S/MIME or PGP.
- 46,973 (0.06%) emails were encrypted: 26,105 (55.57%) using S/MIME and 20,868 (44.43%) using PGP.
- 2,287,922 (2.8%) emails were signed: 2,040,794 (89.2%) using S/MIME and 247,128 (10.8%) using PGP.

Figure 2 illustrates the use of S/MIME and PGP between 1994 and 2020. The first S/MIME signed email appeared in 1998, and the first S/MIME encrypted email in 1999. The first PGP signed email appeared in 1994, and the first PGP encrypted email in 1997.

**Key Insights:**
- Exponential growth in email usage between 1994 and 2020.
- Only 0.06% of emails were encrypted.
- 2.8% of emails were signed.
- S/MIME was more widely used than PGP.

#### S/MIME Certificates and PGP Keys
We provide an overview of the S/MIME certificates and PGP keys found, including those from internal and external senders. Overall, we collected 9,765 S/MIME certificates, 3,741 primary PGP keys, and 3,840 subkeys (refer to Table II for details).

**S/MIME Certificates:**
- All but one certificate that used an elliptic curve encryption algorithm supported RSA encryption.
- 2048 bits was the most widely used RSA key size (91.58%); 5.54% of the RSA keys had 4096 bits. In 237 cases, we saw 1024 bits RSA keys; 6 RSA keys had 512 bits.
- 7,472 (76.52%) certificates supported the SHA-256 signature algorithm. Outdated algorithms, including SHA-1 (2,028; 20.77%) and MD5 (148; 1.52%), were also found. Surprisingly, 11 certificates issued in 2020 used SHA-1. The last certificate using MD5 was generated in 2017.
- 5,194 (53.19%) of all certificates expired in 2020 or earlier. The mean validity period for S/MIME certificates was 3.13 years (sd= 2.70), ranging from a minimum of 4.00 weeks to a maximum of 99.99 years.
- 6,953 (71.20%) certificates were created between 2015 and 2020, with a peak of 1,654 certificates (16.94% of all S/MIME certificates) in 2019.
- We found 671 different issuer names. 1,150 (11.78%) certificates had no issuer. The most prominent issuer was the DFN, issuing 3,209 (32.86%) certificates. 622 (6.37%) were issued by our university. Another German university issued 563 (5.77%) of all S/MIME certificates. In 332 (3.40%) cases, a distinct issuer only signed a single certificate. 89 (0.91%) issuers signed only two certificates. 137 of them (32.54%) had no root CA.

**PGP Keys:**
- Detailed information on PGP keys is provided in Table II.

This comprehensive analysis provides valuable insights into the adoption and use of email encryption and signatures at our university, contributing to the broader understanding of email security practices.
