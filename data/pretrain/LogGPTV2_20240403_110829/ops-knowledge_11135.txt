User: I'm running Ubuntu to compile a set of code which requires python 2.4.
How can I setup a terminal launcher so that when I open that launcher all python related commands will use python 2.4 instead of the python 2.6 that is defaulted in Ubuntu?
Assistant: Watch out for using the alias when wanting to use the python you want.  If the python script uses $0 to figure out, how it was called, then uses that answer to execute another python script. The other script will be called with whatever version that matches the link name, not the version the link points to.
