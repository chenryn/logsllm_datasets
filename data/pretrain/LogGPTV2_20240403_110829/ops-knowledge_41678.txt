User: I would like to connect to a Bluetooth LE device and receive notifications from it in python. I would like to use the Bluez dbus API, but can't find an example I can understand. :-)
With gatttool, I can use the following command:
gatttool -b C4:8D:EE:C8:D2:D8 --char-write-req -a 0x001d -n 0100 â€“listen
How can I do the same in python, using the dbus API of Bluez?
Assistant: See 'test/example-gatt-client' from bluez package
