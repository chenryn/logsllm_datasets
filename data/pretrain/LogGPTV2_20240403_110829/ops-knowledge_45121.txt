Assistant: This log chunk shows the discovery and monitoring of two node cards. The first node card was found to be not fully functional, and the second node card was found to have mismatched VPD ecid. Both node cards had multiple errors, including PGOOD and MPGOOD not being asserted, and multiple idoproxydb hit ASSERT conditions.
