**Description:**

After updating Symfony from version 3.3.2 to 3.3.5, I am unable to properly shut down the local web server running on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

**Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Install Symfony 3.3.5 (This issue is reproducible on a fresh Symfony installation).
2. Start the web server using the command:
   ```sh
   php bin/console server:start
   ```
3. Attempt to stop the web server using the command:
   ```sh
   php bin/console server:stop
   ```
4. Verify that the web server is still running by checking `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. You will notice that the server is still active.
5. Subsequent attempts to stop the server will result in the following error message:
   ```
   [ERROR] No web server is listening.
   ```

However, the web server is still running.
