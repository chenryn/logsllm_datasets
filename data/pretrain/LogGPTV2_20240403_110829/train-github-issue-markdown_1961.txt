Symfony version | 3.3.5  
After updating Symfony (v3.3.2 => v3.3.5) I can't shutdown local web server
http://127.0.0.1:8000
How to reproduce:
  * install symfony 3.3.5 (reproducible on fresh Symfony)
  * php bin/console server:start
  * php bin/console server:stop
  * check http://127.0.0.1:8000 \- it is still up and next stop commands doesnt work: "[ERROR] No web server is listening." - but it is running
