Question: When evaluating the use of AES-EMAC versus alternative MAC algorithms for securing a web application's communications, which of the following considerations are valid? Select all that apply.
"A": "AES-EMAC's use of two different AES keys might complicate key management compared to algorithms that use a single key, potentially increasing the risk of key mismanagement.",
"B": "The simplified nature of AES-EMAC compared to AES-CMAC suggests that it may have a reduced security level, which could be a concern for highly sensitive data transactions.",
"C": "Due to the provably secure nature of AES-EMAC when assuming AES is a secure block cipher, it provides a strong guarantee against tag forgery, desirable for preventing message tampering.",
"D": "The computational efficiency of AES-EMAC could be less than that of other schemes that do not use block ciphers, which might affect the performance in high-throughput scenarios."
Answer: ACD
