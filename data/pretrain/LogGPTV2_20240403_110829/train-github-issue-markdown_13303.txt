### Summary
The versioned API types should be self-contained within a single package. Currently, the file `pkg/api/v1beta3/types.go` is not self-contained and has dependencies on other internal types. This makes it difficult for external clients to import only the necessary source code from Kubernetes (k8s) to use its APIs. It would be beneficial to have a single package that contains all the API object definitions, such as those used for JSON unmarshalling.

### Dependencies in `pkg/api/v1beta3/types.go`
1. **`pkg/runtime`**:
   - The `List` type includes a field `Items []runtime.RawExtension`.
   - `RawExtension` is a simple struct containing a `[]byte`.

2. **`pkg/types`**:
   - Several places use the `types.UID` struct, which is an alias for `string`.

3. **`pkg/util`**:
   - Two types from this package are used: `util.Time` and `util.IntOrString`.
     - `util.Time` is a wrapper around Go's `time.Time` with additional functions for custom JSON serialization (RFC3339 compliant), defined in `pkg/util/time.go`.
     - `util.IntOrString` is a dual-mode struct that can hold either an integer value or a string, defined in `pkg/util/util.go`.

4. **`pkg/api/resource`**:
   - The `ResourceList` object is a map with keys of type `resource.Quantity`.
   - The `Quantity` object contains a field of type `inf.Dec`, which is an infinite-precision decimal package imported from `speter.net/go/exp/math/dec/inf`. This is the only external dependency outside of k8s.

### Additional Notes
- Some of the JSON annotations added are to support Swagger. However, the go->Swagger->go process introduces unnecessary complexity.

### Recommendation
To improve the modularity and ease of use for external clients, it is recommended to refactor the versioned API types into a self-contained package. This will allow clients to import only the necessary API object definitions without pulling in additional dependencies.
