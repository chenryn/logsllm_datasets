**ATT&CK Technique Name:** DNS

Adversaries may leverage the Domain Name System (DNS) application layer protocol to communicate with remote systems, thereby blending in with legitimate network traffic and evading detection or filtering. This technique involves embedding commands and, often, the results of those commands within the DNS traffic exchanged between the client and server. By doing so, adversaries can maintain covert communication channels that are difficult to distinguish from normal DNS queries and responses.
