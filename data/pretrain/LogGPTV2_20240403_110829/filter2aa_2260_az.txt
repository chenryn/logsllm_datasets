Concord has used the TICP process to document and expand previously informal interoperability procedures.  
SOPs have been disseminated, but additional steps need to be taken to promulgate these policies among 
included agencies. The area implemented National Incident Management System (NIMS) more than a year 
ago as part of the statewide certification process.  During the TICP exercise, evaluators commended the area 
for exceptional communication among Unified Commanders.  The communications unit and 
Communications Unit Leader (COML) have begun being implemented into the area’s response structure; 
however, some gaps with the use of the latter position were noted in the exercise.

Concord regularly provides interoperable communication through the area’s very high frequency (VHF) 
systems.  Additionally, the state has implemented a series of gateways, as well as two state radio caches, 
through the Statewide Infrastructure Interoperability Project.  During the TICP validation exercise, the radio 
cache deployment was noted as well done by evaluators.  Some coverage problems were encountered in the 
use of shared channels during the exercise.  Communications to the dispatch center were not always clear or 
understood and often had to be repeated, which was attributed to coverage issues.  Additionally, it was 
unclear whether announcements were made before gateway activation.  The National Guard was also 
actively involved in the TICP planning and exercise. 
Recommendations: 
• 
Regularly test and exercise deployment of regional interoperability resources to improve proficiency, and 
include federal agencies 
• 
Consider adding communications interoperability as a component of all future exercises

The City of Concord maintains several radio systems.  Concord Fire, Concord Police, and Bow Police run a 
predominantly simplex mode VHF high band analog radio system. They also maintain an ultra high frequency (UHF) 
repeater for fire alarm and administrative functions, as well as UHF links for transmitter sites.  Concord Police now 
operate on a Project 25 (P25) compliant, VHF high band, digital radio system that is used in simplex and duplex modes.  
Merrimack County uses a VHF dual mode digital/analog radio system and provides dispatch services for 10 
communities around the Concord area.  The State’s Radio Interoperability Frequency Subcommittee has established a 
standard VHF radio programming template that is used in all VHF Fire and Emergency Medical Services radios, 
providing interoperability across the state.  The area is working toward acquiring a single, shared, fully P25-compliant 
trunked radio system.  The New Hampshire Statewide Interoperability Expansion Project has been under development 
for quite some time and is divided into three areas.  The Project has acquired and installed ACU-1000 audio matrix 
switches at designated communications sites to provide on-site connectivity of multiple frequency band base stations.  
The Statewide Infrastructure Interoperability Expansion Project will require additional VHF low band, UHF, and 
700/800 megahertz base stations or repeaters to achieve interoperability for console-to-base, base-to-base, base-to-
mobile, and mobile-to-mobile communications.  A shared mobile command post platform will provide a movable 
source of infrastructure resources such as dispatch consoles, multiple frequency band base or control station repeaters, 
computer telecommunications facilities, telephone facilities, and wireless access points.

The Middle Rio Grande Valley/Greater Albuquerque Metro Planning Area (Middle Rio Grande Planning 
Area) established the Communications Committee in March 2006 to develop the Tactical Interoperable 
Communications Plan (TICP). The Committee includes public safety support agencies (Public Health, 
Utilities, and the Mayor’s Office) and state and federal agencies. With the creation of the TICP, the 
metropolitan area has published and active agreements among the regional agencies, but they are not yet 
fully in practice across the area. The Mid Rio Grande Planning Area does not have an interoperability 
strategic plan in place and hopes to work with the state to further develop the statewide plan.  The individual 
organizations in the Mid Rio Grande Planning Area maintain their own budgets independent of regional 
strategic planning.  The area obtains most of its communications funding through grants and does not appear 
to have a long-term funding plan.  While public safety communications is a priority at the state level, the 
leadership at the local level has not clearly demonstrated fiscal or political support for interoperable 
communications. 
Recommendations:  
• 
Ensure that all applicable local, state, federal, and tribal agencies (taking into account international 
interoperability efforts) are involved in the decision-making group and define roles and responsibilities 
as part of the group 
• 
Continue to support the decision-making group through regularly scheduled meetings (consider more 
frequent meetings) and actively working issues to address regional (tactical and strategic) interoperability 
• 
Document and put into practice agreements (e.g., memoranda of understanding, mutual aid agreements) 
among all participating agencies to support partnerships on regional interoperability 
• 
Develop and implement a strategic plan (beyond the operational focus of the TICP), with participant 
approval, adoption, and acceptance 
• 
Align local and statewide strategic planning efforts to ensure that regional interoperability needs are met 
• 
Incorporate regional interoperability funding strategy into a strategic plan, including considering funding 
models (in addition to grants) that can leverage local, regional, and statewide strategic planning efforts 
• 
Identify a champion (or group) to motivate and promote continued interoperability progress in the area  
• 
Consider the direct involvement of a high-level official, with political and fiscal authority, to effectively 
and specifically focus on interoperability

began, Albuquerque has worked well with many local, state, federal, and tribal agencies (e.g., Utilities, 
Mayor’s Office, State Police, Customs and Border Protection, Kirkland Air Force Base) to further develop 
regional interoperability SOPs.  It is unclear whether there is full participation with all of the jurisdictions in 
the area (e.g., Valencia County did not attend the planning meeting or exercise).  It is also unclear whether 
the area has actively disseminated the SOPs.  In December 2005, the area created an All-Hazards Plan that 
mandated National Incident Management System (NIMS)/Incident Command System (ICS). Although 
NIMS/ICS was recently implemented, the exercise participants demonstrated proficiency with command and 
control, including the Communications Unit Leader responsibilities.  
Recommendations: 
• 
Encourage full participation of all first responders (e.g., Valencia County) incorporated into regional 
interoperability SOPs  
• 
Continue to develop SOPs within the TICP framework and disseminate throughout area 
• 
Continue basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs (include communications unit

The area operates on a shared system for daily interoperable solutions.  During the TICP validation exercise, 
the participants demonstrated familiarity and proficiency with the area’s interoperable communications 
equipment.  Albuquerque ensured the participation of state and federal agencies (e.g., State Police, Federal 
Bureau of Investigation) in their TICP validation exercise, which allowed for a valuable opportunity for area 
first responders to familiarize themselves with the challenges of interoperating with public safety officials 
who are not as familiar with the area shared system.  The area effectively used the radio cache, gateways, 
shared channels, and the shared system.  The area’s day-to-day usage of the shared system and exercise have 
demonstrated proficient use of interoperable solutions across jurisdictions and agencies; however, it is 
unclear whether all local and tribal first responder agencies are able to demonstrate the same level of 
proficiency.  Albuquerque relies on the use of shared channels and rarely uses gateways for interoperability 
purposes.  The National Guard Civil Support Team participation during the exercise was commendable.  
Recommendation: 
• 
Consider adding communications interoperability as a component of all future exercises (e.g., regional 
first responders should incorporate use of gateways)

The Morton/Stark County Working Group (MSCWG) is beginning to establish interoperability as a priority 
for the area.  The MSCWG was created in 2005 for the development of the Tactical Interoperable 
Communications Plan (TICP). While the TICP takes a positive step in establishing a governance committee, 
the group does not currently have any formalized agreement establishing mission, roles, or authorities (e.g., 
charter).  The area has some formal agreements across public safety agencies in the area but relies primarily 
on informal partnerships among the jurisdictions in the area. The area lacks a formal leadership position or 
body that is helping prioritize communications interoperability; likewise, the area does not currently have a 
strategic plan that incorporates interoperable communications efforts beyond the operational focus of the 
TICP.  There appears to be strong support among the local first responders for emphasizing interoperability 
as a funding priority (e.g., cooperation to fund equipment within jurisdictions); however, the individual 
jurisdictions currently procure communications equipment without a regional plan guiding their decisions.  
Funding is currently based on federal grants, and there is no long-term regional funding plan for recurring 
expenses without which there is no guarantee of continued ability to operate and maintain existing 
interoperable infrastructure.. 
Recommendations:  
• 
Identify state, federal, and tribal representatives to participate in the existing decision-making group, 
develop roles and responsibilities, and establish a charter  
• 
Document, formalize, and put into practice the necessary interoperability agreements (e.g., memoranda 
of understanding) with state, federal, and tribal partners to ensure consistent communications plans 
(including more than existing local mutual aid agreements)  
• 
Develop and implement a strategic plan to chart longer term communications interoperability goals 
(beyond the operational plan put forth in the TICP), and ensure its acceptance by all participating 
agencies; align local and state strategic planning efforts to ensure that regional interoperability needs are 
met 
• 
Initiate the development and implementation of a regional approach to long-term (e.g., 3 to 5 years) 
interoperability planning and sustainable funding  
• 
Consider the direct involvement of a high-level official with political and fiscal authority to specifically 
focus on interoperability 
• 
Consider establishing a direct line of communication among local and state level agencies to advocate 
the importance of interoperable communications

steps to disseminate the communications interoperability SOPs to all agencies in the area, including the 
dispatch centers.  The area also held a TICP Workshop to further distribute the information. The area began 
National Incident Management System (NIMS)/Incident Command System (ICS) training 1 year ago at the 
100 and 200 course levels and is currently working to implement 300 and 400 level series courses. During 
the exercise, however, command and control issues arose, indicating that further practice and training is 
needed on following these SOPs.  For example, a Communications Unit Leader was designated, but did not 
announce his duties over the radio.   
Recommendations: 
• 
Review and revise shared channel SOPs to enhance efficiency and use of channels 
• 
Ensure that regional SOPs are aligned with statewide planning efforts 
• 
Practice NIMS/ICS through training and exercises, and establish a regular training schedule, to improve 
interoperable communications

Regular use of interoperable communications equipment is limited in the area. Stark and Morton counties 
regularly use shared channels to communicate. During the exercise, however, the area relied mainly on 
commercially provided communications devices, which were not accounted for in its TICP. They also 
encountered a channel overload issue among the Incident Commander, emergency operations center, 
emergency medical services command, etc., and available steps were not used to remedy the situation (e.g., 
other available channels were not accessed).  In an attempt to communicate among two sets of first 
responders on separate State Radio Channels, a dispatcher at first manually relayed transmissions, followed 
by the ad-hoc development of a patch; neither of these solutions conforms to the SOPs laid out in TICP.    
Recommendations: 
• 
Consider developing policy on use and limitations of commercial services (e.g., cellular telephones) 
• 
Involve private, state, federal, and tribal agencies in training and exercises 
• 
Consider adding communications interoperability as component for all future exercises

The statewide channels that North Dakota uses are currently being upgraded to digital Project 25 compliant 
conventional channels.  New base stations/repeaters are being purchased and additional frequencies are being licensed 
to support this upgrade.

Providence has a Communications Working Group, which reports to the Domestic Preparedness 
Subcommittee of the Lieutenant Governor’s Advisory Board on Emergency Management.  Although the 
group has been formalized with a mission, authority, and responsibilities, it appears to be driven by the state 
and lacks sufficient local and federal involvement (e.g., law enforcement, fire services, and U.S. Coast Guard 
[USCG]).  There are informal agreements and a mix of formal and informal partnerships among the public 
safety organizations in the area.  The continued development of documented agreements would support the 
formalization of these partnerships to ensure clear roles and responsibilities relating to communications 
interoperability issues and decisions.  The State of Rhode Island is developing plans for a statewide 800 MHz 
system, but Providence does not have a locally driven strategic plan for regional interoperable 
communications that supports both the local and the state long-term interoperability goals.  Officials in the 
area reported that most interoperability funding came from federal grants, and budgets were developed 
annually without a regionwide plan for the procurement, distribution, or spending of grant dollars.  Because 
there is no local tax base or other local funding vehicle for interoperable communications, it appears that
