## Abstract
We have designed and developed DNS X-Ray, a tool that performs comprehensive analyses of DNS platforms on the networks where it is invoked. The analysis identifies the caches and IP addresses used by the DNS platform, fingerprints the DNS software on the caches, and evaluates vulnerabilities that allow the injection of spoofed records into the caches. DNS X-Ray is the first tool to perform an extensive analysis of the caching component in DNS platforms.

Additionally, DNS X-Ray provides historical statistics, enabling networks to check for popular DNS software on the caches, the typical number of caches used on DNS platforms, and more. The tool is accessible online at [dns.xray.sit.fraunhofer.de](http://dns.xray.sit.fraunhofer.de).

## 1. Introduction
The Domain Name System (DNS), as defined in [RFC1034] and [RFC1035], was conceived in the 1980s as a basic lookup functionality. Over time, DNS has evolved into a complex ecosystem, facilitating a wide range of applications and serving as a critical building block in scalable network architectures. Modern DNS resolution platforms typically consist of multiple IP addresses and caches, which may be hosted on different networks and operated by various entities. The configuration, software, and location of these components directly impact the security and performance of networks. However, network operators often have limited knowledge about their DNS platform configurations, including the devices connected, the number of caches used, the operating systems (OSes) and DNS software (SW) running, and the networks and Internet Service Providers (ISPs) hosting the resolving machines.

Understanding the inner workings of DNS is crucial for designing defenses against DNS attacks and mechanisms that utilize DNS, such as client subnet in DNS queries [RFC7871].

### Measuring DNS Platforms
Given the significance and increasing complexity of DNS, the research and operational communities have invested considerable effort in studying DNS infrastructure. For example, [9] measured the client side of the DNS infrastructure of open resolvers to identify the hosts that communicate with clients and nameservers during DNS lookups. More recently, [6] studied vulnerabilities in caches to the injection of spoofed records, while [5] developed approaches for measuring the internal components of DNS infrastructure.

Building on the methodologies presented in [5], we designed and implemented DNS X-Ray, a tool for evaluating DNS resolution platforms. DNS X-Ray is accessible via a webpage at [dns.xray.sit.fraunhofer.de](http://dns.xray.sit.fraunhofer.de). When invoked, it analyzes the DNS platform on the network on which it is run, identifying different components, discovering and characterizing the DNS caches, and evaluating vulnerabilities that allow the injection of DNS records.

DNS X-Ray also provides statistics from all the DNS platforms it has evaluated, allowing clients to compare their results with other platforms on the Internet. The challenge in studying caches is that they cannot be directly accessed by clients or nameservers, and all communication with the caches is performed via the ingress and egress resolvers on DNS platforms (see Figure 1). Additionally, there are intermediate caches, such as those in operating systems or browsers, which DNS X-Ray can bypass.

DNS X-Ray identifies all the IP addresses used by the tested DNS platform, the networks and ISPs hosting the DNS platform, and checks for the adoption of best security practices, such as secure selection of ports and transaction identifiers (TXIDs), and vulnerability to the injection of spoofed records. This enables both security experts and non-experts to learn about misconfigurations or vulnerabilities on their networks and allows researchers to gain insights into DNS resolution platforms in different networks and countries.

### DNS Resolution Platforms
DNS X-Ray can analyze both complex and simple DNS platforms. A general model for DNS resolution platforms is illustrated in Figure 1. The platform consists of a set of ingress IP addresses that handle DNS queries from clients, a set of n caches, and a set of egress IP addresses that communicate with nameservers if the queries cannot be satisfied from the caches.

This infrastructure corresponds to complex platforms like Google Public DNS and can be abstracted to include simple platforms with a single IP address performing both ingress and egress functionalities and using a single cache.

## 2. Related Work
Recently, Schomp et al. [9] measured the client side of the DNS infrastructure of open recursive resolvers to identify the hosts participating in DNS lookups. Their study focused only on IP addresses communicating with nameservers or clients and did not delve into the caching components or the mapping between IP addresses and caches. In contrast, DNS X-Ray provides insights into the caching component and its interaction with other components in DNS platforms.

Several studies have been conducted on open resolvers, such as [7, 10], where the IPv4 address block is scanned for hosts responding to requests on port 53. However, recent work by [2, 15] has shown that most open resolvers are either misconfigured home routers, mismanaged networks, or malicious networks operated by attackers. Our study focuses on the internal structures of DNS platforms, fingerprinting DNS cache software, evaluating vulnerabilities to cache injection, and other properties of DNS resolvers.

To optimize content distribution networks (CDNs), [11] associated DNS resolvers with their clients and designed approaches to passively fingerprint DNS software using nslookup and tracing query patterns. This work was extended by [1], which fingerprinted a limited set of DNS software without using active fingerprinting methods. Both works [1, 11] use flags and fields in the DNS header, including CD, DO, EDNS, and CNAME chains, and patterns in DNS queries to fingerprint DNS software. Turning off DNSSEC (DO bit in EDNS) and IPv6 would prevent them from distinguishing between different resolver software.

Prior work by [14] used server selection mechanisms to perform in-lab fingerprinting of resolver software, including Bind, PowerDNS, Unbound, DNSCache, and MicrosoftDNS. The nameserver selection allows characterization of the software used by the egress DNS resolver. Server selection behavior can be modified in the configuration file by adjusting the target-fetch-policy to 0 0 0 0 0 in Unbound, causing the resolver to use only one nameserver.

In contrast, DNS X-Ray allows repetitive evaluation of networks, identifies a wide range of DNS software, and can detect vulnerabilities in caches it has not previously modeled.

A study by [8] suggested removing DNS resolution platforms and leaving resolution to end hosts, arguing that the overhead on existing end hosts would not be significant. Our study can be used to analyze the complexity of the caching component and its impact on networks if it were removed.

DNS cache poisoning attacks exploit vulnerabilities in caches to inject spoofed records [3, 4, 12]. Relevant to our research are online tools for measuring zone configuration in nameservers and tools for measuring DNS performance and security.
