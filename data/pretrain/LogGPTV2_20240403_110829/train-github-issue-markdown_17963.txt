### Issue Description

I have thoroughly searched the issues in this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.

#### Expected Behavior
When using a mobile device, touching the Tooltip should activate it and display the configured text.

#### Current Behavior
- **Chrome Device Emulator:** Clicking directly on the icon does not activate the Tooltip. Only a small area to the right of the icon consistently activates it.
- **iPhone 7:** The Tooltip occasionally activates, but it is difficult to trigger consistently as the touch area is not reliably registering every touch.

#### Steps to Reproduce
1. Visit the demo page: [Material-UI Tooltips Demo](https://material-ui.com/demos/tooltips/)
2. Test the Tooltip functionality using either:
   - A Chrome Device Emulator
   - An actual mobile device (e.g., iPhone 7)

**GIF Demonstration:**

- At the start of the GIF, I am clicking directly on the icon.
- After a few attempts, I find that the hit area is below the icon.

#### Environment
