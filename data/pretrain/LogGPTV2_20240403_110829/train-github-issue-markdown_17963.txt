## Expected Behaviour
When on a mobile device, touching the ToolTip should activate it, showing the
configured text
## Current Behaviour
Chrome Device Emulator -> clicking on the icon itself does not activate the
ToolTip, only a small area to the right consistently activates it
iPhone 7 -> the ToolTip occasionally fires, it's hard to get is consistently
as the hit area isn't registering every touch.
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
This can be reproduced by testing the demo page in device emulation or on an
actual device:

Start of the gif i'm clicking directly on the icon, after a couple of attempts
i find the hit area below the icon
