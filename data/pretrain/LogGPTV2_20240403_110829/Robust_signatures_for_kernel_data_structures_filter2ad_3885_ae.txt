#### 7. OTHER STRUCTURES
Although our experiments have focused on the `EPROCESS` structure, we are confident that our technique can be generalized to other data structures. Notably, threads (represented by `ETHREAD` in Windows) and file objects (`FILE_OBJECT`) are strong candidates for signature generation, as they contain valuable information about the runtime state of the system, which is useful for forensic analysis. We will briefly discuss the necessary modifications to generate signatures for these structures.

**Profiling Stage:**
The profiling stage remains largely the same for any structure. The objects are created by a user-level program (e.g., by spawning a thread or opening a file), their memory location is determined, and the memory region is monitored to log access to the structure.

**Fuzzing Stage:**
In the fuzzing stage, the main challenge is to create an appropriate functionality test \( \phi \). For threads, which contain executable code, the same test used for processes can be applied: attempt to create a file and ensure its successful creation. For file objects, the functionality can be tested by performing a range of operations on the open file, such as reading, writing, seeking, and closing the file.

**Signature Generation:**
Our signature generator is not specific to any one object type and can be used as-is. The only required input is a list of observed values for each field in the data structure.

**Handling Small Structures:**
A potential complication arises if the target structure is small. In this case, after eliminating weak features, there may not be enough remaining to create a reliable signature with few false positives. To address this, a more sophisticated search technique can be employed. Instead of using basic pattern matching, we can leverage additional contextual information, such as the types of objects to which the structure points. This approach has been successfully used in previous work to identify heap object types [32], and it could improve signature accuracy.

#### 8. FUTURE WORK
As discussed in Section 4.4, achieving full coverage during fuzzing is impractical. However, it may be possible to improve coverage through more judicious selection of random data. For example, we might incorporate mutation fuzzing [29], which generates fuzz data by creating small, random variations on existing values. This would help us more efficiently explore the space of possible values, as legal values for many fields tend to cluster closely together.

**Enhancing Profiling:**
The profiling stage could also be made more accurate by switching from simply monitoring whether a field is accessed to attempting to determine how it is used. This would involve using taint tracking [4] to determine whether the value of a given field actually influences the execution of the OS. We expect this to significantly reduce the number of fields that need to be fuzzed.

**Combining Dynamic and Static Analysis:**
Although the automatically generated signatures from our method appear to work well, they are based on dynamic analysis and may suffer from coverage problems. Gaps in coverage could lead to false negatives and evasions in the signature matching process. To improve confidence in the constraints, static analysis could be used to prove that the inferred constraints hold in all cases.

#### 9. CONCLUSIONS
We have successfully demonstrated that it is possible to automatically select robust features of data structures and generate evasion-resistant signatures based on them. More importantly, we have described a systematic way of determining which features to use when creating a data structure signature. To our knowledge, no such method was previously available, and we believe that many applications will benefit from this technique.

Our work resulted in a new signature for process data structures on Windows, which can be immediately used by applications requiring the ability to locate processes in memory. We also showed that existing signatures used by memory analysis applications were vulnerable to evasion, and in the case of PTFinder, we described precisely which constraints could be violated by an attacker. These contributions significantly increase the difficulty of hiding process objects from signature scans on Windows systems.
