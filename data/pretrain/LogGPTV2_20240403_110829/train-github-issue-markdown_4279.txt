PR ##26089 moved some PD tests to flaky to resolve issue #26127 (and duplicate
#26076). These tests started failing due to PR #21709.
@rootfs is working on a patch to de-flake the tests.
This issue is to track the fix and should be closed when:
  1. The PD tests have been deflaked (verify by running the "pd.go" e2e tests back to back for a couple of hours to verify the issue is fixed).
  2. The flaky label has been removed from the "pd.go" tests that were marked flaky in #26089
