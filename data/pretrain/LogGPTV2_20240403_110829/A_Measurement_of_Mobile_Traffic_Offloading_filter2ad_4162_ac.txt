Fig. 7. WiFi traﬃc usage patterns
– other (130 ESSIDs) is named ESSIDs, i.e., administrators of APs explicitly
changed their ESSIDs. This can be located in homes, oﬃces, shops, etc. Also,
it included unclassiﬁed ESSIDs.
Figure 7 indicates the variation of traﬃc volumes for diﬀerent categories of SSIDs
users associated with: (a) home, (b) mobile, (c) other, and (d) public. We conﬁrm
that the variation of traﬃc volume in home dominates the total amount of the
WiFi traﬃc volume shown in Figure 1. Similarly, the traﬃc variation of the other
category is similar to that of home users, indicating that most of these APs are
also likely located at home. One interesting point in the mobile category is that
its traﬃc pattern was closer to that of 3G traﬃc shown in Figure 1 than that of
the home category; high traﬃc in the morning and evening on Sunday and the
evening on Monday. The usage pattern of a portable WiFi router is similar to
that of the 3G device, indicating that such users save 3G traﬃc costs by paying
the cheaper monthly fee for a portable WiFi router as an alternative. Indeed,
the correlation coeﬃcient of wRx bytes of the mobile category and mRx bytes is
higher (0.16) than that of wRx bytes of the mobile category and wRx bytes of
the home category (−0.01) Also, one unexpected result is a much smaller traﬃc
volume in public WiFi. Sharp and discrete spikes indicate that a small number
of users generate traﬃc volume in a short time; indeed, the biggest peak of the
spikes was traﬃc volume via a FON AP.
In summary, traﬃc oﬄoading in homes currently works well, though that in
public WiFi APs is not very high in our dataset.

4 Related Work
There have been many measurement activities to understand wireless network
traﬃc better, including traﬃc from 3G and WiFi networks.
3G Smartphone Usage: There have been attempts to characterize 3G smart-
phone traﬃc in some countries by measurements at backbone networks or at
smartphones. These studies mainly showed the diversity of usage of smartphones
in many aspects; diﬀerences in device types and carriers [9], user pattern and
protocol [4], application [14,15], geolocation [1], geographical diﬀerences [15], and
mobility [14,10,16]. Related to our work, Ref [14] pointed out the diﬀerence in
usage of applications depending on the stationarity of users. Our data had no
application information, but the penetration of traﬃc volume to WiFi in homes
suggests that the application is used diﬀerently inside and outside homes.
WiFi Usage: The network usage of campus WiFi networks has also been well
studied [8,6]. They pointed out that the application mixtures in the campus
WiFi network diﬀered from those in 3G mobile traﬃc because a wide variety
of devices were connected to the campus WiFi network. Moreover, the WiFi
network usage of specialized public transportation has also been analyzed [7]. A
recent study of WiFi traﬃc of hand-held devices focused on home WiFi traﬃc
in residential traﬃc [12]. It reported that hand-held devices were appeared in up
to 3% of residential DSL traﬃc in 2009.
Availability of 3G and WiFi: 3G and WiFi availability and performance
have been compared in [2,11,5]. They investigated availability and performance
by vehicle and/or walking based measurements. However, some studies only
discussed availability of the WiFi network by the appearance of APs rather than
actual connectivity.
The originality of our work to others is to characterize the 3G traﬃc oﬄoad-
ing through WiFi on the basis of a large-scale device-based measurement and
analysis of a combination of 3G and WiFi traﬃc.
5 Discussion
Our monitors were recruited by a web-based application and most have APs
at home. This means that they are more familiar with using the Internet and
smartphones than the average user. Thus, our results are likely biased towards
the behavior of such advanced users, and the user and traﬃc oﬄoading ratios
of the current average users will be smaller than in our results. However, these
results can be interpreted as corresponding to the situation in the very near
future if 3G carriers successfully promote to average users the option of oﬄoading
more of their traﬃc volume to WiFi, considering the fact that the majority of
residential users have high-speed Internet connections at home. Even in the
current results, the high usage of WiFi was only by a relatively small number
of users, and still 17.4% of the total volume was generated by users whose WiFi
traﬃc volume was less than 1MB. In addition, over 50% of users turned oﬀ their

WiFi interface in business hours, and most of the traﬃc volume of some hybrid
users was downloaded via WiFi in shorter durations. Therefore, the traﬃc and
user oﬄoading ratios could have been higher if the promotion by 3G carriers had
been more eﬀective.
Diﬀerent from the high traﬃc oﬄoad ratio in homes, we observed lower traﬃc
volumes in public WiFi. We cannot currently identify the exact reason for this
low availability of public WiFi, but there are several plausible reasons: (1) Most
users turned oﬀ WiFi connectivity outside the home to save energy. (2) Handover
of WiFi APs did not work well due to fast movement of users. (3) Outside of
downtown areas, the availability of public WiFi may be not very high. (4) There
is wave interference due to a large number of APs at downtown areas. Our
results at least demonstrated the possibility of reason (1) being true as shown in
Figure 2(b). In particular, the advanced users may proactively save the battery
by turning oﬀ the WiFi interface. Also, considering the usage of WiFi and 3G
networks outside homes and oﬃces, users likely need Internet connection only for
e-mail checking or simple web browsing, rather than rich bandwidth applications
such as streaming. Such short and simple usage of smartphones generates a
smaller amount of traﬃc volume. In this sense, the availability and connectivity
are likely more important than bandwidth for such public WiFi.
Connecting a user’s private smartphone to APs at oﬃces is currently not com-
mon in Japan because of security policies of companies, and we also conﬁrmed a
low traﬃc volume of named WiFi in oﬃce hours. However, some companies have
started to allow their employees to connect their private smartphone to APs at
oﬃces. In future, WiFi oﬄoading at oﬃces may become more common.
6 Conclusion
We reported the results of our measurement of mobile traﬃc oﬄoading. We ﬁrst
pointed out that the variation of aggregated traﬃc volume via WiFi is much
greater than that via 3G in our dataset. The average traﬃc oﬄoad ratio was
0.64 and the peak traﬃc oﬄoad ratio could reach 0.95 at midnight. On the
other hand, the user oﬄoad ratio stayed lower, meaning that a small fraction
of users contributed to a large fraction of traﬃc oﬄoading. In fact, our user
level data revealed that the top 30% of users downloaded over 90% of their total
traﬃc volume via WiFi, while 10% of users only used WiFi. However, 20% of
users only stuck to 3G, whose traﬃc volume accounted for 9.4% of the total
traﬃc volume, and over 50% of users turned oﬀ their WiFi interface in business
hours. Moreover, we observed that some hybrid users downloaded most of their
traﬃc via WiFi in shorter durations. In this sense, there is more room to improve
the current situation of traﬃc oﬄoading by promoting users to use WiFi more
eﬀectively. We also showed that WiFi oﬄoading was mainly performed by APs
in homes, and public WiFi APs are still not very commonly used in our dataset.
