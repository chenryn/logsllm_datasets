User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How to get notifications when Google Compute Engine automatically migrate an instance I want to be alerted when instances are migrated. I can see the list of operations in Console (http://d.pr/i/16fpz), but how to get it in realtime (via email or in Slack)?

Assistant: You can use Google Cloud Logging to create a log based Metric and set an alert on that metric using Google Cloud Monitoring. You can refer to this link for steps and more details. However, one thing to keep in mind is that Google Cloud Logging is Beta release and is not covered by any SLA.
