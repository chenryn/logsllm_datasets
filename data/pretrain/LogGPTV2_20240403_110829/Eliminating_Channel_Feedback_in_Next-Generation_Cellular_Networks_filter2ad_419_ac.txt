signal paths, F−1 (cid:126)h1. Observe that, S depends solely on the
directions of the underlying paths (ψn). Thus, in order to
compute S, we need to ﬁnd {ψn}N−1
n=0 for each of the N sinc
functions that sum up to yield this proﬁle. We pose this prob-
lem as an L-2 norm minimization problem. We optimize for
1,n}N−1
{a(cid:48)
1||2 is mini-
mized. Let us write this objective function as:
n=0 such that ||F−1 (cid:126)h1 − S(cid:126)a(cid:48)
n=0 and {ψn}N−1
O({a(cid:48)
1,n, ψn}N−1
n=0 ) = ||F−1 (cid:126)h1 − S(cid:126)a(cid:48)
1||2
(10)
where a(cid:48)
1,n denotes the nth element of (cid:126)a(cid:48)
1
In order to simplify the problem, observe that, if we know
S, the optimization problem becomes a linear optimization
problem and can be solved for (cid:126)a(cid:48)
1 in the closed form. In
particular, the minimum value can be attained by setting
1 = S†F−1 (cid:126)h1, where S† denotes the pseudo-inverse of S.
(cid:126)a(cid:48)
Thus, the objective function in equation 10 can be re-
framed as:
O({ψn}N−1
n=0 ) = ||F−1 (cid:126)h1 − SS†F−1 (cid:126)h1||2
(11)
We have, now, reduced the problem to identifying the di-
rections of the signal paths that contribute to the directional
signal proﬁle. This objective function, however, is non-linear
and non-convex. We discuss in §5.3 how we ﬁnd a solution
to this optimization problem.
Accounting for Phase Variation: Finally, in order to in-
fer channels at a different wavelength, λ(cid:48), we need to ﬁt in
another missing piece. Recall that the phase of a(cid:48)
1,n inferred
at wavelength, λ1 for each of the paths, is dependent on the
wavelength (since a(cid:48)
+jφn). In order to infer the
frequency-dependent component of a(cid:48)
1,n, we leverage the fact
that for cellular systems, the wireless signal is transmitted
at multiple frequencies, called the OFDM subcarriers. This
gives us access to channel measurements on multiple fre-
quencies. Thus, we add the distance dn for each of the paths
as a parameter of the optimization problem given in equation
10. This allows us to solve the optimization problem jointly
for multiple subcarriers and adds constraints to the solutions
returned by the optimization at different frequencies.
1,n = ane−j 2πdn
λ1
In particular, let us denote the channel measurements at
wavelength, λi, by (cid:126)hi, i = 0, 1, . . . , I − 1. We deﬁne (cid:126)Pi =
F−1(cid:126)hi, and Si to be the matrix S corresponding to wave-
length λi. Let, Di be the N × N diagonal matrix such that
Di(k, k) = e−j 2πdk
λi and (cid:126)a be the N dimensional vector such
that ith element is aiejφi. Let (cid:126)P denote the IK dimensional
vector formed by the concatenation of the vectors (cid:126)Pi and S
be the IK × N matrix formed by the concatenation of the
matrices SiDi. Speciﬁcally:
 S =

Thus, the modiﬁed objective function can be written as:
O({ψn, dn, an}N−1
n=0 ) = || (cid:126)P − S(cid:126)a||2
(13)
This objective function is similar to equation 10. Like be-

5.3 Solving the Optimization
In this section, we describe how we solve the optimization
problem that transforms channels to paths. Our goal is to ﬁnd
the values of {ψn, dn}N−1
n=0 , such that:
n=0 = arg min
ψn,dn
{ψn, dn}N−1
s.t. − 1 ≤ψn ≤ 1 ∀n ∈ {0, 1, . . . , N − 1}
O({ψn, dn}N−1
n=0 )
This optimization problem is non-convex and constrained.
In order to solve this optimization problem, we use the well-
known interior-point method. However, since the function
is non-convex, the optimization is prone to convergence to
a local minimum, which is not the global minimum. Thus,
a good initialization is important to ensure that the correct
solution is determined.
• Initialization: R2-F2 computes an approximate solution
in order to initialize the minimization of the objective
function described in equation 14. We compute an approx-
imate probability distribution, P such that P(d, ψ) indi-
cates the probability of the existence of a path from direc-
tion ψ and distance d. A natural candidate to do so is the
power of the inverse Fourier transform of the channel it-
self (akin to Fig. 3(c)-(c’)), which while prone to the win-
dowing and superposition effects provides an approximate
understanding of where signal paths emerge from. Gen-
eralizing the inverse Fourier transform to operate across
both distance and angle-of-arrival, we deﬁne P to be:
(cid:88)
P(d, ψ) = ||
i=1,...,I;k=1,...,K
hi,kej 2π(d+klψ)
λi
||2
where hi,k denotes the channel measured at antenna k and
wavelength λi and l is the inter-antenna separation on the
antenna array. Once, P has been computed for different
values of d and θ, we pick the N largest peaks to initialize
the optimization problem with N paths.
• Stopping Criterion: So far, we have assumed that we
know the number of paths, N, a priori. However, that is
not the case in practice. Notice that, as we increase the
number of paths, N, in our objective function, the mini-
mum value attained on the objective function decreases.
In other words, the algorithm keeps ﬁnding a better ﬁt.
However, after certain number of paths, we start to over-
ﬁt, i.e., the additional paths being found do not correspond
to physical paths, but to signal noise. This could lead to
decrease in the accuracy of our channel estimation algo-
rithm. In order to avoid overﬁtting and yet achieve a good
ﬁt, we incrementally add paths to the solution till one of
the two conditions is met. Either, the value of the objec-
tive function drops below a threshold,5 or decrease in the
value of the objective function is small. When that hap-
pens, we select that value of N as the number of paths.
• Conditioning: When the number of paths, N, is greater
than 1, the optimization can ﬁnd solutions, such that
(ψi, di) is very close to (ψj, dj) for i (cid:54)= j, i.e. two paths
come from nearly the same angle and distance. In that
case, the matrix S becomes ill-conditioned and can lead to
poor solutions. In such cases, R2-F2 rejects one of these
paths and reduces the number of paths by 1. This improves
the condition number of the matrix and avoids overﬁtting.

INTEGRATING R2-F2 WITH THE LTE ARCHI-
TECTURE
This section describes R2-F2’s end-to-end system design,
and how it interacts with the LTE protocol. R2-F2 takes as
inputs wireless channels measured on the uplink at the base
station for a particular user. It outputs the estimated wire-
less channels at the downlink frequency band for that user.
These channels can then be used to perform beam-steering
for advanced MIMO techniques (coherent beamforming, in-
terference nulling, etc.).
The following steps summarize R2-F2’s approach: (1) R2-
F2 runs an iterative algorithm to ﬁnd a representation of sig-
nal paths that ﬁt the observed uplink channels. This is done
by solving the optimization in Eqn. 14 as described in §5.3.
(2) R2-F2 use the recovered 4-tuple signal paths to map the
uplink channels to the frequency used on the downlink chan-
nel (Eqn. 9). (3) Now that it has the values of the uplink chan-
nels for the downlink frequency, R2-F2 applies standard reci-
procity [16] to infer the downlink channels.6 Fig. 5 presents
an overview of R2-F2’s architecture.
We next discuss a couple of issues that arise when inte-
grating the above steps with LTE cellular systems.
6.1 Measuring the Uplink Channels
5We set  to 0.01 × IK, where IK is the number of elements
in h.
6Standard reciprocity infers the forward channels from the
reverse channels by multiplying by calibrated reciprocity
constants, which are computed once for the lifetime of the
device as described in [16].
portance is not the exact value of the wireless channels,
but the relative change in the channels across the antennas.
As a result, a constant multiplied to the channel measure-
ments on all antennas does not affect our ability to perform
all MIMO techniques. Thus, since all antennas on the base
station experience the same CFO, we can eliminate the
phase rotation caused by CFO by dividing the channel of
each base station antenna by the channel of the ﬁrst an-
tenna, measured at the same point in time. This division
scales all channels by the same value and hence does not
affect MIMO techniques.
• Frame Detection Delay: There is a time delay between
the moment the signal reaches the radio and the moment
when it actually gets detected. This delay causes an addi-
tional phase rotation in the measured channels. If we de-
note this detection delay by td, the additional phase ro-
tation is given by 2πftd. The channel measurements on
all the antennas get effected by this quantity. This detec-
tion delay varies per measurement and thus, makes it in-
feasible to combine information across different measure-
ments without eliminating the phase rotation due to the
detection delay. To overcome this challenge, observe that
across OFDM subcarriers any delay in time manifests it-
self as rotation in phase across subcarrier frequency whose
slope is exactly 2πtd. As a result, R2-F2 can enforce con-
sistency between measurements of the wireless channel at
any given frequency by ensuring they have zero relative
slope in phase.
• Hardware Delay: The hardware across different anten-
nas introduces a ﬁxed delay to the different receive chains.
Thus, the wireless channel measured at each antenna suf-
fers a phase rotation. In particular, the channel measured
at an antenna with hardware delay t experiences an ad-
ditional offset e−j 2πct
λ , where λ is the wavelength of the
signal and c is the speed of light. Further, this offset is dif-
ferent for different receive chains. Fortunately, hardware-
induced phase offset is ﬁxed for the lifetime of the base
station and can be calibrated once, apriori and applied to
all future channel measurements.
6.2
Inter-cell Interference
R2-F2’s channel estimates can be used to improve overall
throughput by reducing inter-cell interference at edge clients
– devices that are close to cell boundaries and hence, receive
signal from multiple base stations. R2-F2 adopts two strate-
gies to limit the interference caused at edge clients by neigh-
boring base stations: (1) It encourages sharing of information
between adjacent base stations to predict uplink channels to
users across base stations. This allows the base station to es-
timate the client channels and learn any potential interfer-
ence from the channel estimates of its neighboring base sta-
tions. (2) Base stations can use the channel estimates they
infer from R2-F2 to transmit to their clients while nulling
interference to clients of other base stations that happen to
be at cell edges. Indeed, the same wireless channels used
for beamforming can be employed for interference nulling
as well. Our results in §8 show that interference nulling at
Figure 5: R2-F2’s System Design: The above diagram sum-
marizes the steps in R2-F2’s system design in translating
channels at the base station measured on the uplink to chan-
nels at the user on the downlink frequency bands.
In R2-F2, the base station measures the uplink channels
in order to infer the downlink channels. However, since LTE
uses SC-FDMA on the uplink, the client transmits its data
only on a subset of all OFDM subcarriers. Thus, while LTE
uses one thousand subcarriers, only a subset of those sub-
carriers can be used to measure the uplink channels for a par-
ticular client at any point in time. However, in LTE, a client
does not only send data. It also sends signaling information.
In particular, the LTE standard uses Sounding Reference Sig-
nals (SRS) [3] which the client sends periodically across
OFDM subcarriers. The period of the SRS signal is conﬁg-
urable and takes values between 2ms and 320ms. Thus, R2-
F2 measures the uplink channels using the SRS transmis-
sions. It further reﬁnes these channels with measurements
from uplink data and acknowledgments, which can provide
new measurements every 1 ms, but span only a subset of
the OFDM sub-carriers. Combining all these measurements
allows R2-F2 to obtain a better estimate of the uplink chan-
nels, which naturally improves its inference of the downlink
channels.
One however has to be careful when combining channel
measurements that did not occur at exactly the same time.
Measurements taken at different times can be affected by the
carrier frequency offset (CFO) between the transmitter and
receiver, frame detection delay as well as inherent delays in
hardware. We discuss these effects and how we compensate
for them before combining the channel measurements.
• Frequency Offset: Between any client and the base sta-
tion, there always exists an offset in frequency (CFO), δf .
The CFO causes a phase rotation over time. Thus, two
measurements of the same channel that are taken τ sec-
onds apart, exhibit a phase difference of 2πτ δf . This phase
difference is a measurement artifact; the channels over the
air have not changed. To overcome this issue, we lever-
age the fact that for all MIMO techniques (beamforming,
nulling, interference alignment, etc.) the parameter of im-
