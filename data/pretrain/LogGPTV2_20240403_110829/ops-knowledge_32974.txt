User: i have no way of upgrade to python 2.7 or 3.1 so i am stuck with python 2.6 on my ubuntu 10.04 machine.
will i still be able to find host that supports  python 2.6?
is using python 2.6 still consider outdated or bad practice?
Assistant: Python 2.6 will probably still be around for a while, as Python 2.7 was released only a few months ago.
You can always use from __future__ import ... to make use of some of the newer features from Python 3.x
