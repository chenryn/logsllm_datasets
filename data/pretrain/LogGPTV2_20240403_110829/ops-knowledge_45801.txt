User: Is it possible to access the arguments with which a parent task A was called, from its child task Z? Put differently, when Task Z gets called in a chain, can it somehow access an argument V that was invoked when Task A was fired, but that was not passed through any intermediary nodes between tasks A and Z? And if so, how?
Using Celery 3.0 with RabbitMQ for results backend.
Assistant: I think you can, at least in chord. When you bind=True your task, you can access self.request. In self.request.chord You can find a detailed dict. In its kwargs or options['chord'] you will find what you're looking for, but it's not an elegant solution. Also, if the parent has been replaced, you will only be able to see the final state.
