`tensorflow` currently handles duplicates in `SparseTensor` by keeping the
value for the last index of a repeated coordinate. However, some operations
for this would come in quite handy, namely non-max or non-min suppression
(keeping the maximum or minimum values for repeated coordinates), sum (summing
the values for repeated coordinates) or mean (averaging the values for
repeated coordinates).
There is currently a solution for this in

sparse-tensor. It works great, but to be honest it feels a bit clunky to use.
