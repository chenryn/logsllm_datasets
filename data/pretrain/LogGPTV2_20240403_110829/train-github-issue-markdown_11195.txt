@ symbol is not working with German keyboard layout. Nothing appears in
editor, neither with hardware, nor with virtual keyboard. Works in all other
software. There is no other keybinding set for this in Atom, as far as i can
see.  
If i switch to English layout, it works, but screws all the other symbols,
obviously.
Win 8.1/64bit  
Atom 0.113.0
