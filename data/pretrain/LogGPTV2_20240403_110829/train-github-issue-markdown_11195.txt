I am experiencing an issue with the "@" symbol not functioning properly on a German keyboard layout in Atom. When I attempt to type the "@" symbol, nothing appears in the editorâ€”neither with the hardware keyboard nor the virtual keyboard. However, the "@" symbol works correctly in all other software applications.

I have checked and confirmed that there are no other keybindings set for the "@" symbol in Atom. Switching to the English keyboard layout does resolve the issue, but it causes other symbols to be incorrect, which is not a viable solution.

System Details:
- Operating System: Windows 8.1 (64-bit)
- Atom Version: 0.113.0

Could you please provide any suggestions or solutions to this problem?
