When editing Python scripts, especially for projects involving Google App Engine, I recommend using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that offers robust features such as syntax highlighting and auto-completion. One popular choice is Eclipse, which can be enhanced with the official Google Plugin for Eclipse and the PyDev plugin. This combination provides excellent support for developing applications on the Google App Engine platform.

However, there are other IDEs and editors that you might also consider, depending on your preferences:

- **PyCharm**: A powerful and widely-used IDE specifically designed for Python development. It has built-in support for Google App Engine and offers advanced features like code analysis, debugging, and version control integration.
- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**: A lightweight but highly extensible editor that supports a wide range of programming languages. You can install extensions like "Python" by Microsoft and "Google Cloud Tools" to get comprehensive support for Google App Engine.
- **IntelliJ IDEA**: Another robust IDE that, like PyCharm, is developed by JetBrains. It offers similar features and can be extended with plugins for Google App Engine.

These tools will provide you with the necessary features to enhance your productivity and code quality when working with Google App Engine.
