User: Which editor or IDE do you use when you edit Python scripts? Especially when you are working on Google App Engine.
Do you know any editor/IDE which support Syntax highlighting and auto-completion for Google App Engine modules?
Thanks in advance for any suggestion.
Assistant: Eclipse with the official google appenine plugin and the pydev plugin.
