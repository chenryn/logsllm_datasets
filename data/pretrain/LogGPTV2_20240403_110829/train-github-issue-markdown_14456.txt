  * VSCode Version: 1.0

In LICENSE file it says that VS Code is licensed under MIT. However, when
installing it, you have to agree to a completely different license, which says
that you can't not only "reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the
software" but also "share, publish, or lend the software". In my opinion it
quite contradicts the MIT license:

Should it be like that or is it a mistake?
