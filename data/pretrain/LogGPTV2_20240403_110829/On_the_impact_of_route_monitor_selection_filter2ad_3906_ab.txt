selection again performs best as additional edge links for multi-
homed stub ASes are more likely discovered. The difference be-
tween random and greedy can be up to several hundred, indicat-
ing that we may not have a complete set of multi-homed customer
ASes.

Figure 5: Observed AS path count (including subpaths)
As we have shown, accurate AS path prediction is still quite chal-
lenging. One way to lower the difÔ¨Åculty is to collect as many em-
pirically observed AS paths as possible, as depicted in Figure 5.
Greedy performs the best, followed by the degree-based scheme.
Note that the absolute difference in observed paths for the same
number of vantage points among various schemes can be as large
as one million.
4.3 Discovery of dynamic network properties
We study two applications relying on monitoring of dynamic
routing events.
