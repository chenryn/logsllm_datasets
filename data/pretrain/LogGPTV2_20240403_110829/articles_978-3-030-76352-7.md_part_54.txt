### Stage-Based Process Performance Analysis

**Abstract**
Process performance mining utilizes event data generated and stored during the execution of business processes. For successful application, reliable performance statistics based on an understandable process representation are essential. However, existing techniques typically focus on either interpretability or performance metrics, leaving the challenge of obtaining higher-level performance statistics unaddressed. Using the concept of process stages, we propose an approach that supports human analysts in analyzing performance at the process-stage level. Extensive experiments show that our approach provides reliable results with minimal user effort.

**Keywords:** Process performance analysis, Event abstraction, Process stage, Performance visualization

### 1. Introduction
The goal of businesses is to maximize return on investment, often achieved by improving the efficiency of business processes. Analyzing process efficiency helps companies identify and diagnose bottlenecks, optimizing workload scheduling and resource distribution. Process mining is a technology that enables companies to analyze processes using event logs. Process performance mining, a subfield, focuses on the time dimension to identify and diagnose inefficiencies.

Effective process performance analysis depends on two aspects: interpretability of results and reliability of performance metrics. Most techniques project performance information onto discovered or predefined process models. However, as process behavior becomes more complex, results may become unreliable and difficult to interpret. For example, in Fig. 1, bottlenecks occur infrequently, making diagnosis challenging.

**Problem Statement:**
Consider the medical domain, where specific activities are performed before, during, and after surgery. The exact scheduling of activities within these parts of the process can be arbitrary, leading to complex behavior. This complexity, due to the original granularity of the process, results in unreliable and non-interpretable results, as shown in Fig. 1.

Moreover, diagnosing inefficiencies requires context. For instance, if the average duration of conducting a surgery is 5 hours and preparation is 15 minutes, the efficiency of the surgery might depend on the preparation. Without performance statistics in the context of cases, the bottleneck might be misidentified. This paper aims to enable analysts to locate and diagnose inefficiencies in complex processes by addressing the following questions:

- **Q1:** What is the major part in a complex process that forms the bottleneck, causing additional costs?
- **Q2:** What causes the bottleneck, and how does it impact subsequent parts of the process?
- **Q3:** How reliable are the performance statistics?

**Solution Overview:**
We define "stages" to elevate process performance analysis to a higher level. By focusing on activities that determine stage performance, we provide an overview of stage performance, including throughput time and active time. Details of stage executions are not considered, as they may obscure the big picture. We visualize performance metrics for diagnosis at the stage level.

This approach makes the process easier to understand and diagnose, enhancing the reliability of results by including sufficient performance measurements. Visualizations emphasize performance statistics in the context of cases, supporting the identification of bottlenecks and root causes.

Our implementation and datasets are available for replicating experiments. We evaluate our solution by analyzing two event logs and comparing results with existing techniques. Contributions include:

1. Developing an approach to extract stage executions defined by users, balancing usability and result reliability.
2. Introducing straightforward performance metrics for unbiased analysis.
3. Providing visualizations showing performance evolution and interactions between stages, along with performance distributions for diagnosis.

### 2. Related Work
To our knowledge, this is the first work focusing on performance analysis at a coarser granularity level by extracting instances and computing and visualizing durations. Existing techniques may achieve this through filtering or combining different methods. Filtering based on coarse-granular instances can lead to biased results, while combining techniques involves event abstraction and performance analysis.

**Event Abstraction:**
Techniques can be classified into model-based and non-model-based. Model-based approaches decompose process models into groups of activities, mimicking human intuition [15, 14]. Non-model-based approaches use supervised learning to predict stages [18, 19] or cluster activities based on patterns [12]. These techniques require additional performance analysis techniques to project performance metrics.

**Performance Analysis:**
Model-based techniques project performance statistics onto predefined or discovered process models [5, 9, 21], providing context but potentially biased results. Non-model-based techniques aim to present unbiased results by showing raw performance measures, such as dotted charts [17] and parallel plots [2, 3]. These methods, however, lose context and require additional calculations.
