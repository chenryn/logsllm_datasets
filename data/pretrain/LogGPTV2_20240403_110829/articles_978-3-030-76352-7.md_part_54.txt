Abstract. Process performance mining utilizes the event data gener-
ated and stored during the execution of business processes. For the
successful application of process performance mining, one needs reliable
performancestatisticsbasedonanunderstandablerepresentationofthe
process. However, techniques developed for the automated analysis of
event data typically solely focus on one aspect of the aforementioned
requirements, i.e., the techniques either focus on increasing the anal-
ysis interpretability or on computing and visualizing the performance
metrics. As such, obtaining performance statistics at the higher level
of abstraction for analysis remains an open challenge. Hence, using the
notion of process stages, i.e., high-level process steps, we propose an
approach that supports human analysts to analyze the performance at
the process-stage-level. An extensive set of experiments shows that our
approach, without much effort from users, supports such analysis with
reliable results.

1 Introduction
The goal of all the business is to maximize the return on investment, which
can be realized through improving the efficiency of their business processes [10].
Analyzingprocessefficiencyenablescompaniestolocateanddiagnosethecauses

on the process performance, often referred to as the time dimension, to identify
and diagnose the inefficiencies during the operation of a business process [4].
The effectiveness of the analysis of the process performance depends on two
aspects, i.e., interpretability of the results as well as the reliability of the per-
formance metrics provided. To achieve this, most process performance mining

techniques project the performance information on a discovered or predefined
process model [5,9,21]. However, as the behavior in a process becomes more
complex, theresultsmaybenolonger reliable andinterpretablefor humanana-
lysts. For example, as shown in Fig.1, each of the bottlenecks highlighted only

Problem Statement. Consider the medical domain, where specific activities
are performed prior, during, and after the surgery. In some cases, the exact
scheduling of activities within such a part of the process might be arbitrary,
leading to the complex behavior. Such complexity results from the original level
of granularity of the process, i.e., activities. As shown in Fig.1, the complexity
leads to the unreliable diagnosis due to the noninterpretable results and the
relatively low frequency of the bottlenecks.
Moreover, an effective diagnosis of the inefficiencies in a process requires
the context of cases. Consider the same example of performing a surgery in
the medical domain. Assume that the average duration of conducting a surgery
(during) is 5h and preparation for a surgery (prior) is 15min. Suppose that the
efficiencyofconductingasurgerydependsonhowmuchthenecessarymaterials
orinformationareprepaidforthesurgeryinadvance.Withouttheperformance
statistics presented in the context of a case, the bottleneck may be identified
as performing the surgery. However, the cause of the bottleneck, i.e., how well
the surgery is prepared in advance, may not be diagnosed. The paper aims to
enable analysts to locate and diagnose the inefficiencies in complex processes by
addressing the following questions:
Q1. What is the major part in a complex process that forms the bottleneck
which actually causes the additional costs in the process?
Q2. What causes the bottleneck and how does the bottleneck impact the fol-
lowing parts of the process?
Q3. How reliable is the performance statistics given?
SolutionOverview. Inthispaper,weformallydefinesuchparts astheconcept
of stages to elevate the analysis of process performance to the stage level. By
only consider the activities that would determine the performance of a stage,
we provide an overview of the stage performance with the throughput time of
a stage and the time that the stage is in active in a process. The details of a

stage, i.e., the executions within the stage, are not of concern considering such
detailsmayresultinlosingthefocusofthebigpictureasshowninFig.1.Then,
we visualize the performance metrics for the diagnosis at the stage level.
By doing so, the process can be easier understood and, thus, diagnosed at
a higher level of abstraction. Moreover, the reliability of the results can be
enhanced by including a sufficient number of performance measurements (com-
pared with the bottleneck that occurs only once in the process). Meanwhile, to
supportthediagnosis,thevisualizationsemphasizeontheperformancestatistics
in the context of cases. To summarize, the proposed approach supports an ana-
lyst to identify the bottlenecks at the stage level and diagnose the root causes
before drilling down the process at the original granularity level.
Our implementation and the datasets used for evaluation are available for
replicating the experiments. We evaluate our solution by analyzing two event
logsandcomparetheresultswiththeexistingtechniques.Thecontributionsare
summarized as follows:
1. We develop an approach to extract the execution of stages defined by a
user. According to our evaluation, the proposed approach reaches the bal-
ance between the usability and the reliability of the results compared with
the existing techniques.
2. Provided the definition of stages, we introduce performance metrics that are
straightforward for a user, allowing one to perform an unbiased analysis.
3. Weprovideavisualizationthatshowstheevolutionoftheperformanceatthe
stage level and the interaction between stages. Meanwhile, the performance
distribution of cases are presented together at a glance for diagnosis.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section2 introduces
related work in the field of process mining. The proposed approach is presented

2 Related Work
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that focuses on the perfor-
mance analysis at a coarser granularity level by extracting the instances at the
corresponding abstraction level and compute and visualize the duration accord-
ingly.Usingtheexistingtechniques,suchanalysismaybeperformedbyapplying
filtering or combining different techniques. Filtering based on per target coarse-
granular instance may result in biased performance results. Alternatively, one
may combine different techniques, which we classified into event abstraction
and performance analysis techniques, to analyze the performance based on the
instances extracted at a coarser granularity level.

In [15], the authors decompose a process model into groups of activities, i.e.,
well-defined process steps, by mimicking the intuition of a human analyst iden-
tifying stages according to the modularity of the graph. Mannhardt and Tax
identify the coarse-granular instances based on user-defined patterns which are
represented by process models [14]. However, both approaches do not guarantee
the availability of the results as shown in the experiments.
Other approaches do not require a process model. A supervised learning
technique predicts the stage of an event using a probabilistic model [18,19].
The prediction model is trained with an event log in which all the events are
labeledwiththetargetinstancesatthecoarsergranularitylevel.Assumingthat
thereexistpatternsoftheoccurrenceoftheactivitieswithinauser-definedtime
interval, de Leoni and Du¨ndar cluster activities and annotate the corresponding
clusters to the events [12]. To analyze the performance of the process at the
abstracted level, one has to apply other performance analysis techniques on top
of the results of using the event abstraction techniques. For example, one may
discover a process model at a higher granularity level from an abstracted event
log and project the performance statistics on the model [9,11,21].
Performance Analysis. Similarly, we categorize the techniques into model-
based and non model-based. Model-based techniques project the performance
statisticsonapredefinedordiscoveredprocessmodel[5,9,21].Theperformance
can be analyzed with the context that is presented with the model. Neverthe-
less, due to the modeling formalism, i.e., certain process models do not allow
for expressing all possible control-flow behaviors, the resulting process behav-
ior highly depends on the discovery technique or the modeling method applied.
Theperformancemetricsmay,thus,presentbiasedresults.Also,theaggregated
performance metrics on a model limits the depth of the diagnosis. One needs to
look into the cases in order to identify the root causes.
Other performance analysis techniques do not require a process model. The

technique applied. Generally speaking, they aim to present unbiased results by
showing the raw performance measures. For example, the dotted chart is a sim-
ple, yet powerful, technique that allows batched executions to be observed [17].
However,additionalcalculationisrequiredtoquantifytheobservedbehaviorand
the context, i.e., relationship between activities, is lost. Another work focuses
on the process performance over time with a parallel plot showing the duration
of each process step on a absolute timeline [2,3]. The batched executions, which
