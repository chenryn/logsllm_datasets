### 2.3 Data Collection Strategy

To collect the necessary data, we utilized a combination of tools and techniques, including the `tsocks` tool. We observed that the AppChina app store employs IP address blacklisting, where a host with a specific IP address may be blocked for a period if it exceeds a maximum request limit within a certain interval. To circumvent this issue, we employed a large set of PlanetLab nodes (approximately 100) running a lightweight HTTP proxy in Python. When a crawler instance is about to send an HTTP request to the AppChina app store, it randomly selects one of the PlanetLab proxies to make the request and receives the forwarded response.

Another challenge was the frequent changes in the web graphical interface of some app stores, particularly 1Mobile and AppChina, during the measurement period. This resulted in our previously defined XPATH rules, used in Scrapy XPATH selectors, becoming ineffective. To address this, we monitored the graphical interface structure of each app store on a daily basis and adjusted our XPATH rule set accordingly.

Figure 2.1 provides an overview of the data collection strategy we followed to gather the information needed for our analysis.

### 2.4 Collected Data

The crawling process described above resulted in the following datasets:

| App Store | First Crawl Date | Last Crawl Date | Period | Number of Apps | Number of APKs (All Versions) |
|-----------|------------------|-----------------|--------|----------------|-------------------------------|
| SlideMe   | 2012-03-01       | 2012-08-01      | 5 months & 3 days | 22,184         | 31,731                        |
| 1Mobile   | 2012-05-15       | 2012-08-01      | 2 months & 18 days | 156,221        | 219,508                       |
| AppChina  | 2012-03-30       | 2012-06-03      | 2 months           | 55,357         | 81,969                        |
| Anzhi     | 2012-06-04       | 2012-08-03      | 2 months           | 60,197         | 89,441                        |

**Summary:**
- **Total number of monitored apps:** 316,143
- **Total number of APK files:** 454,427

For each application, we collected all versions of the APK files within the measurement interval. The detailed breakdown is as follows:

- **SlideMe:** The database contains information on 22,184 apps available from March 1, 2012, to August 1, 2012. Of these, 25.3% (5,606) were paid apps, and 74.7% (16,578) were free apps. The total number of collected APK files is 31,731.
- **1Mobile:** The database includes information on more than 150,000 apps from May 15, 2012, to August 1, 2012. This app store is the largest in our dataset and contains only free apps. The total number of collected APK files is 219,508.
- **AppChina:** The database contains information on 55,357 apps from March 30, 2012, to June 3, 2012. The total number of collected APK files is 81,969.
- **Anzhi:** The database includes information on 60,197 apps from April 4, 2012, to August 3, 2012. The total number of collected APK files is 89,441.

### 3. The Rise

In this chapter, we explore the size of the monitored marketplaces in terms of the number of available apps and how this number changes over time. Additionally, we investigate the frequency of app downloads by users and the growth in downloads among different applications.

#### 3.1 Number of Apps

In our first experiment, we examined the number of apps hosted in each marketplace over time. Figure 3.1 plots the number of apps hosted in each app store as a function of time. Each app store hosts tens of thousands of apps, with SlideMe hosting about 24,000, 1Mobile hosting about 160,000, AppChina hosting around 60,000, and Anzhi hosting almost 64,000. Notably, app developers add new apps on a daily basis, resulting in a linear increase in the total number of hosted apps. However, the rate of increase varies among the app stores. For example, AppChina's growth rate is 75% in 62 days, or approximately 1.2% per day, which is higher than the average daily growth of the official Android Market (0.4%).

This rapid growth can be partly attributed to the high demand for mobile devices in China, as reported by Flurry, which noted a 401% growth in iOS and Android active devices between July 2011 and July 2012. Another factor is the blocking of the Android Market in China in 2011, which led many smartphone users to rely on local marketplaces for downloading applications.

**Table 3.1: Marketplaces' Growth Rate in Terms of Number of Available Apps**

| Marketplace | Total Growth (%) | Days | Monthly Growth (%) | Daily Growth (%) |
|-------------|------------------|------|--------------------|------------------|
| SlideMe     | 36.2             | 154  | 7.0                | 0.2              |
| 1Mobile     | 15.2             | 78   | 5.8                | 0.2              |
| AppChina    | 74.9             | 62   | 36.2               | 1.2              |
| Anzhi       | 3.5              | 61   | 1.7                | 0.05             |

#### 3.2 Total Downloads

Next, we investigated the total number of downloads for all apps hosted in each app store as a function of time. Figure 3.2 shows that the number of downloads increases rapidly, approaching a straight line in all app stores. The most rapid increase in downloads is observed in AppChina, where the total number of downloads nearly doubled in a month and a half. In Anzhi, the total downloads nearly doubled within two months.

**Table 3.2: Total Downloads Growth Rate**

| Marketplace | Total Growth (%) | Days | Monthly Growth (%) | Daily Growth (%) |
|-------------|------------------|------|--------------------|------------------|
| SlideMe     | 59.9             | 154  | 11.6               | 0.4              |
| 1Mobile     | 65.9             | 78   | 25.3               | 0.8              |
| AppChina    | 159.5            | 62   | 77.2               | 2.6              |
| Anzhi       | 96.2             | 61   | 47.3               | 1.6              |

These results confirm the significant market share of active smartphones in China and highlight the potential for app developers to gain popularity through these marketplaces. For example, Trilena Games reported collecting over 1,100 downloads in a single week by listing their application in Anzhi.

#### 3.3 Mean Downloads Through Time

To further explore the potential for app developers in Chinese marketplaces, we plotted the mean number of downloads of apps in each app store over time. Figure 3.3 shows that the regression lines for AppChina and Anzhi are steeper, with significantly greater slope values compared to the other app stores. The slope values for the Chinese app stores are one order of magnitude greater than those of the other monitored marketplaces, indicating a much faster increase in the mean number of downloads.

**Figure 3.3: Mean Downloads of Apps Through Time**

- **SlideMe (Mean):** Slope = 4.1
- **1Mobile (Mean):** Slope = 11.2
- **AppChina (Mean):** Slope = 214.0
- **Anzhi (Mean):** Slope = 327.3

These findings suggest that Chinese marketplaces are highly favorable for app developers aiming to achieve a high number of downloads and gain popularity quickly.
