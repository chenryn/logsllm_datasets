(based on the tsocks 3 tool).
Furthermore, we noticed that AppChina appstore uses IP address black-
listing in which a host with a speci(cid:12)c IP address may be blocked from the
appstore for a period of time, if it exceeds a maximum request’s limit within

CHAPTER 2. DATA COLLECTION
a certain interval. To overcome this issue we used a big set of PlanetLab
nodes (roughly around 100) running a lightweight HTTP proxy in Python.
When a crawler instance is about to send an HTTP request to AppChina
appstore, it picks randomly one of the PlanetLab proxies to make this re-
quest instead and receives the forwarded response.
Finally, another one challenge was the fact that some of the apptores,
particularly 1Mobile and AppChina, changed their web graphical interface
during the measurement interval. This had as a result the XPATH rules, we
had de(cid:12)ned in Scrapy XPATH selectors, not to be e(cid:11)ective according to the
new changes. To address this problem we monitored the graphical interface
structure of every appstore in our dataset on a daily basis and adjusted our
XPATH rule set to any of these changes.
In Figure 2.1, there is an overview of the data collection strategy we
followed in order to gather the information needed for our analysis.

that were available in SlideMeappstore from 1st of March until 1st of
August 2012 (5 months). The 25.3% (5,606) of these apps were paid

bilemarketplace in the database for the period between May 15th and
August 1st 2012 (2 and a half months). This appstore is the largest, in
terms of number of apps, in our dataset and contains only free apps.
The total amount of collected APK (cid:12)les is 219,508.
(cid:15) AppChina: The database contains information of 55,357 apps of this
Chinese appstore for the period between 30th March and 3rd June
2012 (2 months). The total APK (cid:12)les collected by this appstore is
81,969.

The total number of monitored apps is 316,143, while the total number of

In this chapter we explore the size of the monitored marketplaces in terms
of number of available apps and investigate how this number changes over
time. Moreover, we further investigate how these apps are consumed by
the users, that is, how frequently these apps are downloaded though time.
Finally, we examine this downloads’ growth among di(cid:11)erent applications,
where we are interested to see whether there are apps whose number of
downloads increase very rapidly through time or apps with no downloads at
all.
3.1 Number of apps
In our (cid:12)rst experiment, we set out to explore how many apps are hosted
in each marketplace. Figure 3.1 plots the number of apps hosted in each
appstore as a function of time for our measurement interval. We can see
that each appstore hosts tens of thousands of apps. For example, SlideMe
hosts about 24 thousands of apps, 1Mobile hosts about 160 thousands of
apps, AppChina hosts around 60 thousands of apps and (cid:12)nally Anzhi hosts
almost 64 thousands of apps. Interestingly, we see that app developers add
new apps on a daily basis. Indeed, as Figure 3.1 shows the total number
of apps hosted increases linearly with time. Note, however that the rate of
increase is di(cid:11)erent for each appstore. For instance, we see that AppChina
rises much faster than the other marketplaces, achieving an increase of 75%
in 62 days, reaching an increase rate of close to 1.2% per day, greater than
the average daily growth of the o(cid:14)cial Android Market (which is in average
0.4%, as we have already shown in Section 1.1). This outcome can be veri(cid:12)ed

in part by Flurry, which claims that China is the fastest growing share of iOS
and Android active devices with a 401 percent growth between July 2011
and July 2012 [14]. This remarkably vast share of mobile devices in China
seems to attract the interest of app developers, who try to promote their
software in this large market for pro(cid:12)t. Another possible reason that could
explain this extraordinary rise may be the fact that Android Market was
blocked from China in 2011 [11]. This fact may have led many smartphone
users to rely on other local marketplaces for downloading applications.

Table 3.1 presents the growth rate in terms of number of apps for the 4
monitored marketplaces. We can see that except from AppChina, the rest
marketplaces note reasonable daily growth rate from 0.05% to 2%, that is
about the half of the one observed in the o(cid:14)cial Android Market.

Figure 3.2: Number of total downloads in the marketplaces as a function
of time.
Figure 3.1 shows that the number of apps produced and hosted in app-
stores increases linearly with time. It would be interesting to see how fre-
quently are these apps downloaded (i.e. consumed) by the users. Figure 3.2
shows the total number of downloads for all apps, hosted in each appstore,
as a function of time. Interestingly, we see that the number of downloads
increases rapidly with time, and in all appstores approaches a straight line.
The most rapid increase in downloads can be found in AppChina, where
the total number of downloads almost doubled in a month and a half. The
next largest increase appears to be in Anzhi, where the total downloads were
nearly twice in number within 2 months. More speci(cid:12)cally, in Table 3.2 we
see that in the two Chinese appstores, the monthly growth rates of down-

loads (77% for AppChina, 47% for Anzhi) are much higher than those of the
other two marketplaces (11% for SlideMe and 25% for 1Mobile). This result
con(cid:12)rms the huge size of market share in terms of active smartphones, in
China. Moreover, these appstores seem to be very promising for mobile app
developers who aim to increase the number of downloads (hence popularity)
of their apps. For instance, the video game company Trilena Games 1 states
that by putting one of their applications in Anzhi marketplace resulted in
collecting over 1100 downloads within a single week [10].

Figure 3.3: Mean downloads of apps through time.
In this section, we try to explore a little deeper the perception that Chinese
marketplaces are very propitious for app developers, who intend to earn
many downloads from their apps, thus to gain much popularity, within a
short time period.
In order to investigate deeper this issue, we plot the
mean number of downloads of apps in each appstore through time. The
results are illustrated in Figure 3.3. We see that regression lines of (cid:12)tted
data curves for AppChina and Anzhi are steeper than those of two other
appstores, with signi(cid:12)cantly greater slope values. Surprisingly, we see that
slope values of (cid:12)tted lines in Chinese appstores are one order of magnitude
greater than those of the other monitored marketplaces.
