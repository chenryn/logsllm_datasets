There are a few countermeasures you could follow to keep your wireless
network safe from hackers.
1. Change your routers default password and make sure you have WAP
encryption enabled. If your router doesn’t have a WAP option, use WEP. It
is better than nothing.
2. Use a long secure password for your router. Include numbers, lowercase
letters, uppercase letters and other symbols. The more obscure the better.
3. Make sure your router has the option to not broadcast your SSID enabled.
This will prevent some programs like Net Stumbler from locating your
wireless network.
4. Use MAC filtering on your router. Every wireless card and wireless adapter
has a MAC address. By choosing to allow only your MAC addresses onto the
network, you can keep a lot of attackers out.
5. To prevent packet sniffing attacks from affecting you, make sure the
important sites you use, like banks, use SSL (Secure Socket Layer)
encryption. You can tell if the site has SSL enabled if the URL begins with
https:// instead of http:/.
6. In cafés or other hotspots where internet is free, packet sniffing is very
common. To avoid being affected use a VPN (Virtual Private Network)
service to encrypt the data you send across the internet.

Windows Hacking
79
NetBIOS
NetBIOS stands for Network Basic Input Output System. It allows your LAN
or WAN to share drives, folders, files and printers. Gaining access to a computer
through NetBIOS is very simple and easy. The only thing required is for the target
machine to have file and printer sharing enabled and to have port 139 open.
Below I will show you an example of what a hacker would do to gain access to a
Windows machine through NetBIOS.
1. First the hacker would search for a target. A common tool used by hackers
is Angry IP Scanner . Download and install it.
2. Next the hacker would insert the IP range he would like to scan. If the
hacker was connected to a WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network) he would
scan the local computers like I have shown below.
3. Since the hacker’s goal is to gain access to a system through NetBIOS, which
runs on port 139, he will choose to scan each found host for that port. Click
the downward arrow on the right and check the Scan ports box. A popup
will come up asking you if you would like to select a new port. Click YES.
80
4. Type in the port number 139 into the first box and click OK.
5. Click start. The program will begin scanning and when it’s complete a box
with the results will come up.
6. As you can see 224 Ips were scanned. Out of those only one was alive and
luckily it has port 139 open.
81
7. Open the Command Prompt by going to Start -> Run -> Type in cmd ->
 .
8. Now the hacker would run the “nbtstat –a TargetIPaddress” this will tell us
if the target has file and printing enabled. Without it, this attack is not
possible.
82
9. In the above image DAVIDS-MACHINE is the name of the target computer.
If you look to the right of it you will see the number . This means that
file and printer sharing is enabled. If there was no  then you could not
go any further and would have to find a new target.
10. Next the hacker would run the command “net view \\TargetIPaddress”.
This command will display any shared drives, folders, files or printers. If
nothing comes up, you won’t be able to gain access to anything since there
is nothing being shared. In my case, I got the following:
11. In my example, I have two printers shared and one disk named
SharedDocs. The hacker would be able to take control of my printers and
view everything in my SharedDocs disk.
12. To gain access to my SharedDocs disk, the hacker would have to map out
the drive onto his computer. If successful, the hacker will have all the
contents of my drive on his computer.
13. To map out my drive onto his computer the hacker would use the
command “net use G: \\TargetIPaddress\DriveName”. So in my case I
would run the command “net use G:\\192.168.1.101\SharedDocs”. You
can use any letter in place of G:\\. This just tells the computer what to
name the drive on your computer.
14. What’s this? Looks like I already have a drive G. To avoid this problem, go
to My Computer where it will show all of your current Drives. To fix this
simply change the letter G to a nonexistent drive letter.
83
15. Once the command is completed successfully, go to My Computer and you
should see a new drive under Network Drives. Double clicking it brings up
all of the targets documents.
Cracking Windows Passwords
To crack Windows XP and Windows Vista passwords, we will use the
program called ophcrack. Ophcrack is a Windows only password cracker, and it
uses rainbow tables to get the job done quickly. It cracks passwords for both
Windows XP and Vista but it is more powerful on XP because Vista fixed the
security hole that allowed XP to crack passwords easily. Windows uses a couple a
couple types of hashes. One of them is the LM (Lan Manager) hash. If a password
is longer than seven characters, then it is split into seven character chunks, made
into all uppercase, and then hashed with the DES encryption. Because it is split
into parts and made all uppercase, the total number of different password
combinations goes down significantly, and makes it easier for hackers to crack the
password. The Windows password hashes are stored in a couple places:
84
• In the C:\WINDOWS\system32\config directory where it is locked to all
accounts but the system account which you don’t have access to.
• In the registry: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESAM where it is also locked for all
users.
So you might be wondering, how can I get a copy of those hashes? There are a
couple ways.
• Boot from a Linux live CD and copy the SAM file onto a USB or floppy
disk.
• Use the PWDUMP program that comes with ophcrack to trick the
registry into giving up the hashes.
1. First download and install ophcrack. As you can see there are two
versions. In this example we will be using the program itself in windows,
so download the first option.
2. Once you have it downloaded, install it. When the option comes up to
download rainbow tables, unclick them all and just install the program.
It is better to download the rainbow tables separately.
85
3. Once it is installed, go to the ophcrack website and click on Tables in the
navigation. This will display all the tables you can download. As you can
see, the more characters covered, the bigger the table gets. Choose the
correct table for your operating system.
86
4. In the example, I chose the largest possible free table. Next run
ophcrack and click on tables. Select the table you downloaded and click
Install to locate the file on your computer. Hit OK to continue.
87
5. Next we will be running PWDUMP to obtain the password hashes. Make
sure all of your anti-virus and anti-spyware programs are disabled
because most anti-virus programs mistake PWDUMP for a malicious
program since it accesses the system files. If you don’t disable the anti-
virus program PWDUMP will fail in retrieving the hashes.
6. Click Load and select Local SAM. This will load all the password hashes
for all the users on your computer and display them.
7. Next click Crack and the program will begin to crack the password
hashes.
8. Once the program finishes cracking, you should see a screen similar to
the following:
88
9. As you can see, two out of three of my account passwords were cracked
in a matter of a couple minutes.
• Bob : lolcats
• David M: not found
• Pushkin: Christmas02
Ophcrack LiveCD
The next method to crack the Windows hashes I will show you is
through an ophcrack LiveCD.
1. Go to the ophcrack website and choose the correct operating system
LiveCD to download.
2. With the downloaded .ISO, create a LiveCD the same way you did with
the Ubuntu LiveCD in the Linux chapter.
3. Put the CD in your CD-Drive and restart to boot from the CD.
4. You will see the following screen:
89
5. Hit  or wait six seconds to boot into the Ophcrack Graphic
mode. If something goes wrong and the screen won’t show the
Graphics, restart and go into the Ophcrack Graphic VESA mode. If this
also fails, go into Ophcrack Text mode.
6. Once it ophcrack loads completely, it will automatically get your
Windows password hashes and begin the cracking process.
90
Countermeasures
There are a couple things you can do to prevent NetBIOS and Ophcrack
password cracking attacks.
1. To keep computer from being a target of NetBIOS attacks, simply disable
file and printer sharing. In Windows Vista, it is disabled by default but you
must do a little work in Windows XP.
• Go to Start -> Control Panel -> Network Connections.
• Double click on your active connection. In my case it is the Wireless
Network Connection 2.
• Click on Properties.
• If File and Printer Sharing is selected, deselect it and click OK.

Chapter Eight
Malware
93
Malware is a big problem today. Everyday thousands of innocent people
are getting infected by different types of malware. The most common types of
malware today are viruses, worms and Trojans. In this chapter we will discuss all
the types of malware, and give you an example of a windows trojan in use. The
reason we will use Windows is because malware is very rare in Linux and Mac
computers.
Definitions
1. Viruses – Viruses cannot spread without the help of us humans. They are
like parasites because they need a host to attach themselves to. The
host is usually a legitimate looking program or file. Once this program is
launched, the virus is executed and infects other files on your computer.
Viruses can be very destructive. They can do damage to your computer
hardware, software and files. Viruses are spread through the sharing of
files and are many times sent within emails via attachments.
2. Worms – A worm is a malicious program that can replicate itself onto
other computers on a network. Unlike a virus, worms don’t need a
human to be able to spread and infect systems. Once it infects a system,
it uses that system to send out other copies of itself to other random
systems attempting to infect them.
3. Trojan Horse – A trojan horse is a malicious program that can be used to
do silly things to a system like changing its desktop, mess with the user
interface, and take control of your mouse. It can also be used for some
serious things like accessing your data, erasing your files, stealing your
passwords, and capturing your keystrokes.
4. Logic Bombs – Logic bombs are usually pieces of code that are
programmed into a program that lie dormant until a certain time or until
a user does a certain action which causes it to be executed. When it is
triggered it performs a certain function that the program wasn’t
intended to do.
5. Bacteria – Bacteria make many copies of themselves and eventually end
up taking up all of the computers recourses such as all of its processor
power, memory and disk space. This results in the legitimate user losing
access to those resources.
94
6. Blended Threats – Blended threats combine all of the characteristics of
the above and use them along with system vulnerabilities to spread and
infect machines.
ProRat
To show you an example of a malicious program, I will use a well known
Windows Trojan, ProRat.
1. Download ProRat. Once it is downloaded right click on the folder and
choose to extract it. A password prompt will come up. The password will be
“pro”.
2. Open up the program. You should see the following:
95
3. Next we will create the actual Trojan file. Click on Create and choose Create
ProRat Server.
4. Next put in your IP address so the server could connect to you. If you don’t
know your IP address click on the little arrow to have it filled in for you
automatically. Next put in your e-mail so that when and if a victim gets
infected it will send you a message. We will not be using the rest of the
options.
96
5. Click on the General Settings button to continue. Here we will choose the
server port the program will connect through, the password you will be
asked to enter when the victim is infected and you wish to connect with
them, and the victim name. As you can see ProRat has the ability to disable
the windows firewall and hide itself from being displayed in the task
manager.
6. Click on the Bind with File button to continue. Here you will have the
option to bind the trojan server file with another file. Remember a trojan
can only be executed if a human runs it. So by binding it with a legitimate
file like a text document or a game, the chances of someone clicking it go
up. Check the bind option and select a file to bind it to. In the example I
will use an ordinary text document.
97
7. Click on the Server Extensions button to continue. Here you choose what
kind of server file to generate. I will stick with the default because it has
icon support, but exe’s looks suspicious so it would be smart to change it.
98
8. Click on Server Icon to continue. Here you will choose an icon for your
server file to have. The icons help mask what the file actually is. For my
example I will choose the regular text document icon since my file is a text
document.
99
9. Finally click on Create Server to, you guessed it, create the server file.
Below is what my server file looks like.
10. A hacker would probably rename it to something like “Funny Joke” and
send it as an attachment to some people. A hacker could also put it up as a
torrent pretending it is something else, like the latest game that just came
out so he could get people to download it.
11. Now, I will show you what happens when a victim installs the server onto
his computer and what the hacker could do next.
12. I’m going to run the server on my own computer to show you what would
happen. Once I run it the trojan will be installed onto my computer in the
background. The hacker would then get a message telling him that I was
infected. He would then connect to my computer by typing in my IP
address, port and clicking Connect. He will be asked for the password that
he made when he created the server. Once he types it in, he will be
connected to my computer and have full control over it.
100
13. Now the hacker has a lot of options to choose from as you can see on the
right. He has access to all my computer files, he can shut down my pc, get
all the saved passwords off my computer, send a message to my computer,
format my whole hard drive, take a screen shot of my computer, and so
much more. Below I’ll show you a few examples.
14. The image below shows the message I would get on my screen if the
hacker chose to message me.
101
15. Below is an image of my task bar after the hacker clicks on Hide Start
Button.
16. Below is an image of what the hacker would see if he chose to take a
screen shot of the victims screen.
102
As you saw in the above example, a hacker can do a lot of silly things or a
lot of damage to the victim. ProRat is a very well known trojan so if the victim has
an anti-virus program installed he most likely won’t get infected. Many skilled
hackers can program their own viruses and Trojans that can easily bypass anti-
virus programs.
Countermeasures
There are a couple things you can do to prevent yourself from being infected
by the malware discussed in this chapter.
1. Make sure you have good and up-to-date anti-virus software installed on
your computer. Also if there is an automatic update option on your anti-
virus software, make sure it is enabled.
2. Make sure you have a firewall installed on your computer and make sure
that it is actually enabled. Firewalls protect against unauthorized inbound
and outbound connections.
