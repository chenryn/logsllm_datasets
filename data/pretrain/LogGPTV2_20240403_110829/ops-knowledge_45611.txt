Similar to a tiling server for spatial image data, I need to display many on-the-fly generated images in my Django-based web application. These images may involve merging, color correction, and other manipulations. Since a single client can easily request over 100 images in a short time, it is easy to overwhelm the web server (Apache + mod_wsgi).

To address this, I am exploring alternative approaches. Given that we already use Celery, asynchronous image processing seems like a promising solution. I have switched the WSGI server to gevent, with Apache serving as a proxy. However, I have not yet managed to implement the push mechanism, and I am uncertain if this is the right direction.

Based on this, I have three questions:

1. **Is using Celery, gevent, and Socket.IO a sensible approach to handle many clients without overwhelming the web server? Are there any alternatives?**
2. **If I offload the image processing to Celery and let it push the image data to the browser when it is done, will the connection bypass Apache?**
3. **If a push mechanism is used, would it be better to use a single connection or one for each image (and close it when done)?**

### Background

The Django application I am working on allows users to display very large images. This is achieved by tiling the large images and showing only the currently relevant tiles in a grid. This method is standard in the field of mapping and spatial image data (e.g., OpenStreetMap). Unlike typical mapping data, our application also includes multiple Z slices that users can scroll through (biological images).

This setup works well when the tiles are statically served. However, I recently added the option to generate tiles on the fly, which involves merging different images, color correction, and other manipulations. This process is resource-intensive, with each image taking about 0.1 seconds to generate. Using Apache with mod_wsgi (WSGIRestrictedEmbedded On), the server easily becomes overwhelmed. Browsing through the image stack can cause the web server to hang. I have tried adjusting MaxClients, turning KeepAlive off, and experimenting with different thread/process combinations for mod_wsgi, but these changes have not been sufficient to support more than one user.

### Proposed Solution

A potential solution is to use a load balancer with a front-end server (e.g., NginX) that can multiplex and cache requests, distributing the load across multiple backend servers. This approach is well-suited for distributed computing environments, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS). You could store the tiles in S3 storage or NFS over EBS, with all image manipulation servers accessing a single image repository.

Initially, you can run both the web application and one instance of the image manipulation server on the same machine. The architecture would consist of three main components:

1. **Web Server**: Handles the calculation of image URLs and encodes the required manipulations as parameters in the URLs.
2. **Image Server**: Receives the "image formula" and generates the JPEG tile.
3. **File Server**: Provides access to the large images or original tiles.

I have experience with similar architectures where image layers are stored in a single file (e.g., five zoom levels, each with fifteen channels from FIR to UV, totaling 75 "images" up to 100K pixels on a side). The client can request specific tiles, such as 'Zoom level 2, red channel plus double of difference between UV-1 channel and green, tiles from X=157, Y=195 to X=167, Y=205'.
