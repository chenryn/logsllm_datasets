### Structured Users to Install the Kazakhstan Root Certificate

The government of Kazakhstan instructed users to install a root certificate, claiming its purpose was to protect against fraud, hacking, and illegal activities. However, the actual intention may have been to surveil users' online interactions and communications.

### Impact and Response

Despite the government's claims, it is unclear how many users were affected, and none were able to share their data. In response to our findings, two major browser vendors, Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome, took action on August 21, 2019, by implementing changes that completely blocked the use of the Qaznet root certificate, even if manually installed [33]. Although this step was taken after the interception system was shut down, it prevents the system from being used again without users having to install a different certificate.

We advocate for an even quicker response in the event of similar incidents in the future. Given the prevalence of network security products that require users to install custom certificates, the option to add trusted certificates remains necessary. However, we recommend that browsers add non-intrusive visual indicators to alert users about potential security risks each time a custom root certificate is in use.

### Further Recommendations

Additionally, we recommend further research into and higher adoption of defense mechanisms against large-scale Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks in the HTTPS ecosystem [28]. We also encourage content providers to employ techniques to detect and share information regarding large-scale HTTPS interception attacks from particular countries or networks. As described in §4.2.4, interception systems may have unique TLS fingerprints, which would allow content providers to alert users whose connections are intercepted or take other protective actions.

### Longitudinal Analysis

Our longitudinal measurements, shown in Figure 3, reveal daily patterns (likely due to routing changes) and an extended outage during which the system was tuned. Interception was paused on the evening of Friday, July 26, and resumed four days later, on the morning of July 30, with some changes to the logic for setting certificate validity periods. This suggests that the system was under active testing and development. Overall, we observed a median of 340 TLS hosts experiencing interception when it was active. We noticed some periodic trends, such as a daily increase from 9 P.M. to midnight. Further investigation revealed that TLS hosts from four subnets belonging to mobile providers observed the interception only during this period, indicating a possible routing change.

### Discussion

Kazakhstan's HTTPS interception attacks represent an escalation in efforts by certain governments to gain access to encrypted communications. Unlike previous state-sponsored interception attacks, which were limited in scope and sophistication [19, 24], this attack covered a wide range of popular sites and lasted several weeks, potentially allowing the government to capture data and credentials for many thousands of users.

Significantly, Kazakhstan was able to intercept HTTPS traffic without compromising a browser-trusted Certificate Authority (CA), as in some previous incidents [5]. Instead, users were forced to trust the government’s custom root CA (and allow interception), or access to many of the targeted sites would be effectively blocked. Because of misleading communication from ISPs suggesting the certificate was intended to protect users’ security, many users may have installed it without knowing its adverse effects. Browser security indicators would then give them a false sense of security, as the lock icon would be displayed even when the custom certificate was in use.

### Conclusion

With countries such as China and Russia practicing extensive censorship and moving closer to a controlled and balkanized Internet, end-to-end encryption is more important than ever for keeping users safe. In this paper, we explored Kazakhstan’s government-sanctioned HTTPS interception attack in detail using direct and remote measurements. Such attacks threaten the protection offered by HTTPS and weaken security and privacy for the country’s Internet users. It appears that the Kazakh government is willing to conduct further interception in the future, and other governments may adopt similar techniques. We urge the Internet security community to prepare for such events by performing closer monitoring and instituting policies for how to respond. If such interception attacks become normalized, decades of progress towards an end-to-end encrypted web will be lost for many of the Internet’s most vulnerable users.

### Appendix

**Certificate Chain:**
Figure 4 shows the parsed certificate chain from our measurements. The root certificate (top left) with the subject "Qaznet Trust Network" has a validity period of 30 years. The intermediate Security Certificate (bottom left) has a three-year validity period, and the leaf certificate (right) has the same validity period as the original certificate (but shifted by six hours).
