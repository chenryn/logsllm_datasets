**OS version** : OS X 10.10.5
**Description of the problem including expected versus actual behavior** :
Response to `_cat/fielddata` when there is an actual "ip" field in the indexed
data reports the IP address of the node in the column where the size of
fielddata used by the "ip" field should appear.
**Steps to reproduce** :
    #0. Delete the index
    DELETE test_field_data
    #1. Create the index with a document:
    POST test_field_data/test_field_data
    {"reason": "something is off", "ip": "192.168.1.0"}
    #2. Flush
    POST _flush
    #3. Perform a search that loads fielddata
    GET test_field_data/_search
    {
      "query": {
        "match_all": {}
      },
      "aggs": {
        "ip": {
          "terms": {
            "field": "ip",
            "size": 10
          }
        },
        "reason": {
          "terms": {
            "field": "reason",
            "size": 10
          }
        }
      }
    }
    #4. Inspect the fielddata
    GET _cat/fielddata/ip,reason?v
The return looks like:
    id                     host      ip        node total reason ip

I have also seen a response from a 3 node cluster, also v 2.3.1, where two of
the nodes are reported as shown above, and the third node actually has the
fielddata usage reported, both in the correct place and in the column where
the node ip address is supposed to appear.
