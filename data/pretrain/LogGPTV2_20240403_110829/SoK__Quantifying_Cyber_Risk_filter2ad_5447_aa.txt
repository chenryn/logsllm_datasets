Abstract—This paper introduces a causal model inspired by
structural equation modeling that explains cyber risk outcomes
in terms of latent factors measured using reﬂexive indicators.
First, we use the model to classify empirical cyber harm studies.
We discover cyber harms are not exceptional in terms of typical
or extreme losses. The increasing frequency of data breaches
is contested and stock market reactions to cyber incidents are
becoming less damaging over time. Focusing on harms alone
breeds fatalism; the causal model is most useful in evaluating
the effectiveness of security interventions. We show how simple
statistical relationships lead to spurious results in which more
security spending or applying updates are associated with greater
rates of compromise. When accounting for threat and exposure,
indicators of security are shown to be important factors in
explaining the variance in rates of compromise, especially when
the studies use multiple indicators of the security level.

I. INTRODUCTION
Unsupported claims about
the increasing risk of cyber
attacks pervade introductions to security talks and papers. Or-
ganisations are expected to invest more in security even though
research has inconsistently demonstrated how interventions
reduce risk. This state of affairs leads to perceptions that cyber
risk is more art than science.
With this in mind, our paper aims to systematise what is
known about quantifying cyber risk. Risk estimates can justify
additional resources for mitigation or be used to guide post-
incident response. The term cyber will bristle with many in
the security community. However, it is the concept of choice
for policymakers and business leaders who make many of the
decisions that security research should hope to inﬂuence. Such
decisions are premised on foundational questions like:
RQ1 How much harm results from cyber incidents?
RQ2 Which security interventions effectively reduce harm?
RQ3 Have these answers changed over time?
Whereas security vendors scramble to provide self-interested
answers with shaky methodologies [7, 82], this paper ﬁnds

answers in empirical studies of real-world security outcomes.
We systematise the literature using a causal model linking
latent variables for security, exposure, and threat to security
outcomes. The proposed model captures empirical cyber risk
research ranging from machine learning models predicting
web server compromise through to ﬁnance studies quantifying
shareholder losses resulting from cyber incidents.
We focus on classifying studies quantifying cyber risk in
organisations. The term cyber risk has two components, risk
describes possible negative consequences (harm) weighted by
the probability of occurrence. Cyber restricts our scope to
incidents caused by logical (as opposed to physical) force [17].
Under this deﬁnition a ﬁre (physical force) in a data centre
(information harm) is not a cyber risk, whereas ﬁre damage
(physical harm) caused by compromised control systems (log-
ical force) would be. Incidents within scope include denial
of service attacks, machine and web-resource compromise,
and organisational incidents. Associated harms range from lost
shareholder value to ransomware payments to wasted time.
Our literature search ﬁrst identiﬁed relevant works in top
security conferences and the Workshop on the Economics
of Information Security. We used backwards and forwards
reference searches to identify additional relevant works until
saturation was reached. Doing so captured relevant studies
from disciplines including law, information systems, ﬁnance,
and physics. We included studies that empirically measure
real-world compromise or harm affecting organisations, which
is a minority approach within the science of security [60,
p. 12]. Studies providing promising ways of measuring secu-
rity, exposure or threat were also included even when harm
was not considered. We point readers to Anderson et al. [7]
for aggregate estimates of cybercrime costs, and Dambra et
al. [32] for cyber risk transfer research.
Section II introduces the causal model. Section III sur-
veys harm studies speaking to RQ1. Section IV identiﬁes
mitigation studies that address RQ2. Temporal
trends are
identiﬁed throughout (RQ3). Section V discusses progress
towards RQ1–3, model limitations, and future work.
II. A CAUSAL MODEL OF CYBER RISK
Risk is unobservable but we can indirectly measure its re-
alisation as losses. Figure 1 uses artiﬁcial data to illustrate the
stochastic relationship; the highest observed loss has multiple
twins with similar security levels but much smaller losses.

Regression analysis is designed to explore relationships in
the presence of statistical noise. The Appendix contains a brief
tutorial on regression analysis but the conﬁdent reader may
continue. Putting measurement issues to one side, ﬁtting a
linear model in which security is the only explanatory variable
(the blue line) suggests increasing security is associated with
greater losses. This result has been found empirically—higher
IT security budgets are associated with greater frequency of
data breaches [105]. Research designs based on observational
data are vulnerable to confounding variables and so we need
to add relevant variables to the regression model.
Adding threat level leads to a better ﬁt (see the Appendix
for more detail) and provides insights into cross-dependencies.
In Figure 1, the red dotted line slopes downwards while the
green dashed line has a (not statistically signiﬁcant) upward
slope, which suggests security only reduces harm when it is
implemented by the high-threat population. In fact, threat is
the only necessary condition for harm to occur. As such, secu-
rity should be conceptualised as moderating the relationship
between threat and harm, such that more security translates
into less expected harm.
level
The intuition that security effectiveness depends on the
threat
is baked into risk management. If security is
mitigation in risk management, then a third variable, exposure,
is analogous to the amount of risk acceptance. More exposure
means more vectors can be used to gain access (surface
exposure) and a greater value of assets can be compromised
(asset exposure), both of which amplify the effect of threat on
expected harm. Figure 2 represents the relationship between
threat level and expected harm as moderated by security and
exposure. The notation E(+) denotes a positive relationship
in which more exposure ampliﬁes the link between threat
and harm, and S(−) denotes a negative relationship. Many
research designs fail to account for all three variables.
Measuring these abstract variables is challenging in practice.
Reported losses ignore the full spectrum of harms [2] and harm
is often avoided thanks to luck alone. The effect of security
in moderating this stochastic relationship between threat and
harm is even more difﬁcult to measure. No single indicator
captures the sum of preventive and reactive measures across
an organisation’s technology, processes and people. Modelling
security as a latent variable overcomes this issue by linking
noisy, observable indicators to the high-level concept.
Figure 2 shows this graphically as the latent variable for se-
curity has reﬂexive indicators I1,...,Ik, which can be measured
with mi. The arrows ﬂow from security to the indicators Ii
because the indicators do not cause security, rather the security
level inﬂuences the likelihood of a given measurement mi. The
latent variable must be inferred from these reﬂexive indicators.
Although Figure 2 describes the ideal research design,
relationships like S(−) can still represent statistical models
comprised of manifest variables in which variables like se-
curity or threat are assumed to be directly measurable. This
allows us to systematise a diverse body of literature on cyber
risk quantiﬁcation and show which factors determining risk
outcomes are under consideration.
Very few studies directly link security interventions to
harm outcomes. It is useful to introduce a mediating factor,
compromise, which may or may not result in harm. Studies
investigating the effectiveness of security controls tend to
focus on an indicator of compromise without quantifying
the resulting harm, whereas studies quantifying harm tend to
sample exclusively from compromised entities (C = 1 in our
model). Doing so cannot quantify how preventative security
affects incident likelihood because C = 1 for all ﬁrms.
Often these studies explore how harm varies based not on
the threat level, which is stochastic and difﬁcult to measure,
but based on the threat actor (e.g. ransomware gang) who
caused an incident. While this provides some information
about the threat level (e.g. a more sophisticated actor suggests
a higher threat level), it cannot be measured for ﬁrms who
were not compromised (C = 0). We denote this special case

T|C, namely the type of threat conditioned on compromise.
Figure 3 shows the extended model using SEM notation.
To make this concrete, a 2017 study [116] is illustrated
on Figure 3 using red arrows and indicators Ix. The authors
argue that although indicators of security (e.g. hiding version
numbers or the SSL conﬁguration) correlate with less abuse
when aggregated across web hosting providers, these vari-
ables do not directly cause security improvements. Rather
the indicators are assumed to be reﬂexive indicators of an
unobservable security level. The authors [116] construct four
latent variables for preventive security Sp in order to explain
website compromise C when controlling for surface exposure
Es. Table VI (in the Appendix) describes the corresponding
technical indicators.
The rest of this paper systematises literature on cyber risk
according to which of the relationships depicted in Figure 3
are explored. We focus on the statistical tests in the main
contribution and ignore preliminary results or tables. This
will be summarised in Table III. Our classiﬁcation requires
a fair amount of interpretation because assumptions are often
unstated. For example, many data breach studies do not control
for the size or industry of the victim, which we suggest is
an implicit assumption that threat and exposure are constant
