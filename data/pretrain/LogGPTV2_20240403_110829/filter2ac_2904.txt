title:blackhat:asia-23 Hand Me Your SECRET, MCU! Microarchitectural Timing Attacks on Microcontrollers are Practical
The discovery of Spectre and Meltdown has turned systems security upside down. These attacks have opened a novel frontier for exploration to hackers and shed light on the untapped potential of hidden transient states created by shared microarchitectural resources. Since then, we have witnessed the rise of a plethora of effective software-based microarchitectural timing side-channel attacks capable of breaking and bypassing the security (isolation) boundaries of numberless processors from mainstream CPU vendors (Intel, AMD, Arm). Notwithstanding, one class of computing systems apparently is resilient to these attacks: microcontrollers (MCUs). MCUs are shipped in billions annually and are at the heart of every embedded and IoT device. There is a common belief that MCUs are not vulnerable to these attacks because their microarchitecture is intrinsically simple.In this talk, we challenge the status quo by unveiling a novel class of microarchitectural timing side-channel attacks affecting MCUs. First, we provide evidence of the existence of this channel on multiple platforms. Then, we explain the building blocks, the overall methodology, and the main challenges we faced in successfully mounting the attack. To close our talk, we discuss and demonstrate how to bypass the isolation guarantees of a reference TEE architecture on a state-of-art MCU. We perform a live demo of this attack emulating a secure smart lock IoT application.
