**Date:** Thursday, September 26, 2013  
**Location:** Beijing, China

#### Overview
In this presentation, Rich Mogull shares some of his most memorable and instructive failures from the year 2011. The key points include:

- **Student Involvement:** 25 students participated in the project.
- **Instances and Connections:** 50 instances and 50 SSH connections were managed.
- **IP Address:** All activities were conducted using a single IP address.

#### Key Incident: "Heap Spray" Attack
- **Incident Description:** A "heap spray" attack was executed, originating from Amazon's infrastructure, targeting a college.
- **Explanation:** A heap spray is a technique used to increase the likelihood of successful exploitation by overwriting memory with a large amount of data.

#### ISACA and COBIT 5
- **Introduction:** On behalf of ISACA (formerly known as the Information Systems Audit and Control Association), I would like to discuss how IT can transform cybersecurity using COBIT 5.
- **COBIT 5 Framework:** COBIT 5 is a framework designed to integrate cybersecurity with an overall approach to security governance, risk management, and compliance.
- **Importance for IT Teams:** This is particularly critical given the increasing threat of Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs).
- **Survey Results:** According to a survey of 1500 security professionals, more than 80% admit they are not prepared for APTs.
- **Challenges:** The rise of APTs is especially daunting in a world characterized by always-on connectivity, an increasingly IT-centric society, and a new class system that separates people by their technology skills.

This presentation aims to provide insights into the importance of learning from past failures and the role of frameworks like COBIT 5 in enhancing cybersecurity.
