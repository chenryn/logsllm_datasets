I am contacting you on behalf of ISACA, formerly the Information 
Systems Audit and Control Association Trade Association, who 
would like to speak with you about how IT can transform 
cybersecurity using COBIT 5 – a framework to integrate 
cybersecurity with an overall approach to security governance, risk 
management and compliance. This is critical for IT teams  in the 
wake of escalating Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). More than 
80 percent of 1500 security professionals surveyed by ISACA admit 
they are not prepared for APTs. The challenge of APTs is 
particularly daunting in the face of always-on connectivity, an 
increasing IT-centric society and a new class system that separates 
people by technology skills.
