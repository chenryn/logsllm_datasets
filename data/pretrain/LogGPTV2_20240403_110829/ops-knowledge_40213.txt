User: After uploading a binary distribution of my Python C extension with python setup.py bdist upload, easy_install [my-package-name] fails on "error: Couldn't find a setup script in /tmp/easy_install/package-name-etc-etc".
What am I doing wrong?
Assistant: Sometimes you don't actually really intend to easy_install the 'directory', which will look for a setup.py file.
In simple words, you may be doing easy_install xyz/
while what you really want to do is easy_install xyz
