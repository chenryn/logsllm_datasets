User: Please explain how to use VPN technology at the network layer to realize a secure connection for remote access to internal network resources.
Assistant: VPN (Virtual Private Network) technology can establish an encrypted communication tunnel through the Internet and other public networks, convert the access data of external users into encrypted data, and then transmit it to the internal network of the enterprise through the tunnel. In a small-scale local area network, a point-to-point VPN can be used to establish an encrypted communication tunnel between two terminals, so that the communication data between the two terminals can be encrypted and transmitted. In a large-scale enterprise network, a set of VPN servers can be set up, which will be encrypted and transmitted to the VPN client deployed on the local network in a centralized manner. The secure connection of VPN technology to remotely access local network resources mainly includes the following steps: 1. Build a VPN server inside the enterprise network, and configure the server's network address, VPN protocol, encryption algorithm and other parameters. 2. Connect to the VPN server through the VPN client software on the external terminal device, and establish an encrypted tunnel. 3. The encrypted data is transmitted through the Internet to the VPN server for decryption, and then enters the internal network to access the required network resources. In this way, VPN technology is used to encrypt and protect the communication between the external terminal and the enterprise network, which can effectively prevent unauthorized access and attacks such as hackers and malicious software, and improve the security of network resource access.
