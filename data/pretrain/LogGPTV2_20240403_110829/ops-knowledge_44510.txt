Assistant: This log chunk shows the process of a server instance being resumed. The process begins with a GET request to the server detail, followed by the image cache checking the image and confirming it is in use. A POST request is then made to the server external events, followed by the instance being spawned successfully and resumed. The instance took 19.74 seconds to spawn and 20.55 seconds to build. The image cache is checked again and confirmed to be in use.
