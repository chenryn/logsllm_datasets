### Key Focus: Per-Anycast Site and Per-Client AS Analysis

Our primary focus is on the per-anycast site analysis and per-client Autonomous System (AS) analysis, ranking each by median latency, interquartile range (IQR) of latency, and query volume. We prioritize anycast sites because they are under operator control. If we identify sites with high latency, we can investigate and potentially correct routing issues [7, 68].

#### Client AS Analysis
We also examine client ASes to address the user-side of the problem, specifically at recursive resolvers, as minimizing client latency is a key goal in DNS services. Although improving performance in client ASes can be challenging due to the lack of a direct relationship with network operators, we demonstrate in Section 4 that some issues can be addressed.

#### Prioritization Metrics
To prioritize our investigation, we consider:
1. **Median Latency**: A proxy for overall latency at the site.
2. **Interquartile Range (IQR)**: The difference between the 75th percentile and 25th percentile latencies, capturing the spread of possible latencies.
3. **Query Volume**: Identifies locations where improvements will affect more users.

We sort by overall query rate rather than the number of unique sources to prioritize large ASes that send many users through a few recursive resolvers (high rate, low number of recursive IPs).

### Prioritization by Site

**Figure 5** shows the per-site latency for .nl, broken down by protocol (IPv4 and IPv6) and site, for two anycast services (A and B). For each site, we display two bars: the fraction of total queries and the number of ASes (filled and hatched bar in each cluster). We overlay these with whiskers for latency, showing the median, 25th percentile, and 75th percentile. Some sites, such as CDG for Anycast B in IPv6, exhibit high IQRs, while others, like LAX-A and NRT in IPv4, show lower IQRs. We provide detailed analysis of these cases in Section 4.

### Prioritization by Client AS

**Figures 6 and 19** (Appendix B) illustrate the latency distribution for the ten ASes with the largest query volume for Anycast A and B of .nl. Many ASes show good latency (low median and small IQR), but the top two busiest ASes for Anycast A in IPv4 (Figure 6a) have a high median and large IQR (Figure 6b). This indicates anycast polarization, a problem described in Section 4.3.

**Figure 7** shows latencies for the top ASes for B-root, with quartile ranges as boxes and the 10th and 90th percentiles as whiskers. We rank ASes by query rate (Appendix B) on the x-axis. While rank provides a strict priority, showing ASes by rate helps evaluate the importance of addressing more ASes. If the next AS has a much lower rate, addressing its problems will not significantly impact user experience.

### Problems and Solutions

Given new information about IPv4 and IPv6 latency from DNS/TCP (Section 2) and priorities (Section 3), we examine anycast performance for two of the four anycast services operating for .nl and for B-root. For each problem, we describe how it was found, the root causes, and, when possible, solutions and outcomes. We present two previously documented problems (Sections 4.1 and 4.2) and a new problem (Section 4.3). Our near-real-time monitoring (Section 4.4) helped us discover these issues before user complaints.

#### 4.1 Distant Lands

The first problem is "distant lands," where a country lacks local anycast servers and has limited connectivity to the rest of the world. This issue occurred for Australia and New Zealand when trans-Pacific traffic was metered, and today, it affects China. China has a large population of internet users, but its international network connections can be congested [73].

**Detection**: We observed large IQR latency for .nl’s Anycast B in both IPv4 and IPv6 at Tokyo (NRT), Singapore (SIN), and CDG (v6), all with 75th percentiles over 100 ms. Many queries come from Asian ASes, particularly Chinese ISPs (Figure 9).

**Resolution**: The best resolution would be deploying new anycast servers for Anycast B inside China or manipulating BGP to steer traffic to nearby sites. However, foreign operation of sites in China has only recently been allowed [73], and anycast operation from China risks service for non-Chinese clients traversing the national firewall.

#### 4.2 Prefer-Customer to Another Continent

The second problem is when an AS prefers a distant anycast site, often on another continent, because that site is a customer of the AS. This is a common BGP routing policy, where an AS prefers routes through its customers over peers or transit providers.

**.nl Detection**: We detected this problem for .nl Service B by observing high IPv6 median latency (124 ms) for queries in São Paulo, Brazil (GRU). Many high-latency queries were from Comcast (AS7922), a large U.S.-based ISP. We confirmed that North American clients of this AS were routing to the Brazil site (Figure 8).

**.nl Resolution**: We contacted .nl Anycast B’s operator, who determined the issue was with one of their upstream providers. After deploying BGP communities to limit the IPv6 route, Comcast traffic remained in the US, reducing the 75th percentile latency by 100 ms.

**B-root Detection**: B-root observed high latencies for traffic going to a South-American anycast site. We identified a primarily-North American ISP sending all its traffic to the South American site, ignoring lower-latency sites.

**B-root Resolution**: We poison the route to prevent latency problems, significantly reducing traffic arriving at this site.

#### 4.3 Polarization with Google and Microsoft

Anycast polarization is a problem where traffic is needlessly sent to another continent, following from BGP’s limited knowledge of latency and the flattening of the Internet [27].

**Detecting the Problem**: We discovered this problem by examining DNS/TCP-derived latency from the top two ASes sending queries to .nl Anycast A. AS8075 (Microsoft) and AS15169 (Google) showed very high IPv4 median latency (74 ms and 99 ms), and Google had a high IQR (99 ms) and high IPv6 median latency (104 ms).

**Conforming the Problem**: .nl Anycast A has six sites, and nearly all queries go to a single anycast site due to routing preferences (Table 5). For Google, this site is in Amsterdam, and for Microsoft, it is in Miami.

**Depolarizing Google to .nl Anycast A**: We investigated Google’s preference for AMS and determined that Google has a direct BGP peering with the site at AMS. We worked with the AMS operators and Google to resolve this problem by withdrawing the AMS peering, spreading queries across multiple anycast sites, and reducing median latency from 100 ms to 10-40 ms (Figure 11).

### Conclusion

By prioritizing and analyzing per-anycast site and per-client AS, we can identify and address high-latency issues, improving overall DNS service performance. Continuous monitoring and collaboration with operators are essential for maintaining optimal service.
