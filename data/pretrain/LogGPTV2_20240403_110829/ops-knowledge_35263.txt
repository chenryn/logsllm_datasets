User: I am stuck here trying to make a python script to access windows registry. My issue is that I get an error file not found using the following path:

"SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows
  NT\CurrentVersion\NetworkList\Signatures\Unmanaged"

It works until NetworkList and afterwards it just returns the error of file not found. I tried using different folders in the directory NetworkList but it gives error file not found for any of them. Using ragedit I can see that the directories that I am trying to access do exist. Any ideas?
Assistant: Fixed it be deleting python 32 bit and installing python 64 bit, works like a charm
