Using `.table-reponsive` only works on the smallest screen size.
Solution 1: Use `@grid-float-breakpoint` so it becomes responsive when the
navbar does (currently what we do in projects)  
Solution 2: Use another variable that defaults to `@screen-sm-max` that can be
overwritten in another less file
