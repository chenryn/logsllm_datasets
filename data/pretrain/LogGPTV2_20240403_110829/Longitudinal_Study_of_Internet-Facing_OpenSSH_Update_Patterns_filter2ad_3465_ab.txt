### 3.3 Do Cloud-Hosted Servers Update Faster?

Next, we examine whether major cloud providers exhibit different updating behaviors compared to the rest of the Internet. We focus on three major hosting providers: Amazon Web Services (specifically EC2), Azure Cloud, and Google Cloud. To analyze their update patterns, we map their IP addresses based on the publicly announced netblocks.

Figure 3b compares the OpenSSH patch superseded dates on Ubuntu for these cloud providers against the remainder of the Internet. The results show that all three cloud providers have relatively similar patch level distributions, while the rest of the Internet lags behind. These cloud providers collectively account for approximately one-third of all hosted Ubuntu OpenSSH servers, indicating that their improved performance has a significant impact overall.

### 4. How Vulnerable is Outdated Software?

With a more accurate understanding of the software patch levels of OpenSSH, we now examine the distribution of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) over time to determine if CVEs influence patch speed. We have collected additional snapshots from Censys, ranging from late 2015 through 2020, on a nearly weekly basis. These snapshots include SSH banners for the entire IPv4 address space collected by Censys. We parse each SSH banner and map it to a backported patch version where applicable.

We analyzed CVEs announced between August 2015 and the end of 2019. For each of these 27 CVEs, we created a mapping of which backported patches are affected by which CVEs. This mapping starts by checking which upstream versions are affected by each CVE from the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). If the upstream OpenSSH version of a given security patch is not affected by a CVE, then that patch version is also not considered affected. For security patches where the upstream version is affected, we inspect the changelog text available on Launchpad to see if the patch or a previous patch in its tree claims to fix the CVE.

Table 2 summarizes the CVEs with their initial publish dates, the earliest upstream patch date, and the earliest Ubuntu backport patch date (if available). We also compute the lag between when a given CVE was announced and when it was patched in the upstream or backported fix. In cases where the lag for the OpenSSH fix is negative, the CVE affected older versions but not the most recent one released at that time. In the few cases where the Ubuntu backport lag is negative, the CVE appeared as fixed in the changelog before the official publish date on the NVD website.

We note that 7 out of the 27 CVEs are not fixed in any backports, so the only way to eliminate these vulnerabilities is to manually update the OpenSSH software to a newer upstream version. One CVE (2016-8858) was disputed in the community as to whether it was even a vulnerability, and no backport was issued.

Using the mapping of CVEs to vulnerable Ubuntu backports, we compute the number of OpenSSH servers that are vulnerable and not vulnerable to each CVE for each Censys snapshot within 2015 and 2019. We then combine these over time to show the total number of IPs that are and are not vulnerable to a given CVE over time. An example of this for CVE-2016-10009 is shown in Figure 4. In this figure, the blue line represents the number of IP addresses that are vulnerable to CVE-2016-10009 over time, while the orange line represents the number of IPs that are not vulnerable. The sum of the orange and blue lines at a given point on the x-axis equals the number of servers in that Censys snapshot running OpenSSH on Ubuntu with a security patch available on Launchpad. The noise in the data is related to the number of IP addresses Censys scanned at each point in time. The number of Ubuntu servers that Censys scans generally increases over time, except for a sharp drop in early 2016, which might be attributed to large providers opting out of Censys scanning. The gaps in the lines indicate periods where no scan data was available from Censys. Several snapshots between 2016 and 2018 contain significantly fewer IP addresses than adjacent snapshots, but we chose not to omit these scans from the plots because they accurately reflect variations in how much scanning Censys completed at those times. These dips should be ignored when drawing conclusions.

We observe that the near-simultaneous publication of the CVE and upstream patch has very little impact on the deployment of vulnerable servers. The steady increase in vulnerable OpenSSH servers continues for slightly more than one year until the Ubuntu backport is published, at which point the patch is rapidly applied to more than one million machines, followed by a steady linear increase in the subsequent months and years. From this example, it appears that the availability of backports is the dominant factor in applying updates to eliminate software vulnerabilities.

**Figure 4: Number of IP Addresses Affected by CVE-2016-10009 Over Time**

We analyzed the plots of all 27 CVEs (available in Appendix A) to see if the same trend held true. We found that many IP addresses patch very quickly as soon as a backported patch for a CVE is released, although some never patch. For the CVEs that do not have a security backport (indicated by darker backgrounds), the results are less predictable. Often, the number of vulnerable servers naturally decreases over time as users update their software for other reasons (e.g., CVE-2015-6563). In other cases, the number of vulnerable servers continues to increase well after the CVE was published (e.g., CVE-2018-15919).

Another consistent finding from inspecting the graphs is that the publication of the CVE and upstream patch is not the catalyst for updates. Instead, it is consistently the backport that sparks an uptick in patches to plug vulnerabilities.

Finally, we collapse the 27 individual plots in Appendix A, which capture exposure to individual CVEs, into a single, aggregated view of the presence of vulnerabilities in OpenSSH over time. Ultimately, what matters from a security perspective is whether systems have any unpatched vulnerabilities present.
