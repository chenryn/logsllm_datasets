User:  Please analyze whether there is a problem in the following log 20171223-22:15:29:648|Step_ExtSDM|30002312|calculateAltitudeWithCache totalAltitude=240
Assistant: Whether there is an exception: no exception Description: The log information is a normal application log. It can be seen from the log information that when the application calculates the height information related to the number of steps in the current day, it calls the "Step_ExtSDM" function and outputs the calculation result in the form of a string. The calculation result is the altitude information corresponding to the number of steps in the current date. Therefore, the log information does not contain any abnormal information.
