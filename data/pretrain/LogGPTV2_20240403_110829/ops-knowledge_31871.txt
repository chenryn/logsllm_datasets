I have a sub-directory containing my Python files for compilation. Recently, I added a new file but forgot to include it in the `CMakeLists.txt` file. Despite this, the build was successful.

My question is: Does CMake automatically detect all the files in the specified sub-directory? Or does it only detect files that have dependencies with other files already listed in the `CMakeLists.txt`?

Thank you.

**Response:**

In CMake, any file that needs to be included in the build process should be explicitly mentioned in the `CMakeLists.txt` file. This ensures that CMake can track changes to these files. 

Using the `GLOB()` command to collect source files is generally not recommended because CMake will not automatically detect when a new source file has been added. As a result, the build system may not be updated correctly, leading to potential issues.

To ensure that your new file is included, you should add it explicitly to the `CMakeLists.txt` file. For example:

```cmake
set(SOURCES
    file1.py
    file2.py
    new_file.py  # Add your new file here
)
```

This way, CMake will include the new file in the build process and track its changes appropriately.
