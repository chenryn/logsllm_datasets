User: I have a sub-directory in which i have my python files for compilation
I added a new file and accidentally forgot to add it to CMakeList.txt
The problem is that the build was successful. 
My question is does CMake detect automatically all the files in the indicated sub-directory? or does it detect any files that have dependencies with other files added to CmakeList.txt?
Thanks.
Assistant: Any file should be explicitely mentioned in CMakeLists.txt in some way for track its changes in CMake.
That is why using GLOB() command for collect sources is not recommended: CMake will not detect automatically whether new source file has been added.
