The `top` command in Linux is a powerful, real-time system monitoring tool that provides a dynamic, real-time view of a running system. It displays a list of active processes, sorted by their resource usage, such as CPU and memory.

Key features and information provided by the `top` command include:

1. **Process Information**: 
   - **PID (Process ID)**: A unique identifier for each process.
   - **User**: The user who owns the process.
   - **PR (Priority)**: The scheduling priority of the process.
   - **NI (Nice Value)**: The nice value, which affects the process's priority.
   - **VIRT (Virtual Memory Size)**: The total amount of virtual memory used by the process.
   - **RES (Resident Set Size)**: The non-swapped physical memory used by the process.
   - **SHR (Shared Memory Size)**: The amount of shared memory used by the process.
   - **%CPU**: The percentage of CPU time used by the process.
   - **%MEM**: The percentage of physical memory used by the process.
   - **TIME+**: The cumulative CPU time consumed by the process.
   - **COMMAND**: The name or command line of the process.

2. **System Summary**:
   - **Uptime**: The time the system has been running.
   - **Number of Tasks**: The number of running, sleeping, stopped, and zombie processes.
   - **Load Average**: The average system load over the last 1, 5, and 15 minutes.
   - **CPU Usage**: The percentage of CPU time spent on user, system, and idle tasks.
   - **Memory Usage**: The total, used, and free physical and swap memory.

3. **Interactive Commands**:
   - **h**: Display help and a list of interactive commands.
   - **k**: Kill a process by specifying its PID.
   - **r**: Change the priority (nice value) of a process.
   - **M**: Sort processes by memory usage.
   - **P**: Sort processes by CPU usage.
   - **q**: Quit the `top` command.

The `top` command is particularly useful for system administrators and developers to monitor and manage system performance, identify resource-intensive processes, and troubleshoot issues in real-time.
