User:  How to set timed tasks in Linux system? Can you provide an example to illustrate.
Assistant: In the Linux system, you can use the crontab command to set up scheduled tasks. Here is an example: 1. Open a terminal and enter the following command: ``` crontab -e ``` 2. In the opened editor, enter the following: ``` * * * * * /bin/echo "Hello World" >> /home/user/hello.txt ``` The meaning above is to execute the command "/bin/echo "Hello World"" every minute and append the output to "/home/user/hello .txt" file. 3. Save and exit the editor, thus completing the setting of the scheduled task. Note: When creating a scheduled task, you need to pay attention to determine the time point and the command to execute. In addition, if there are multiple scheduled tasks, each task should occupy one line, separated by a line break, for example: ``` * * * * * command1 15 2 * * * command2 ``` The above scheduled tasks mean that every Execute the command1 command every minute, and execute the command2 command at 2:15 a.m. every day.
