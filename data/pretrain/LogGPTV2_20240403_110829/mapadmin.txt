Parameters
Parameter
Description
Specifies the remote computer running the User Name Mapping service that you want to administer. You can specify the computer using a Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) name or a Domain Name System (DNS) name, or by Internet Protocol (IP) address.
-u 
Specifies the user name of the user whose credentials are to be used. It might be necessary to add the domain name to the user name in the form domain\username.
-p 
Specifies the password of the user. If you specify the -u option but omit the -p option, you are prompted for the user's password.
start | stop
Starts or stops the User Name Mapping service.
config
Specifies general settings for User Name Mapping. The following options are available with this parameter:-r ::: Specifies the refresh interval for updating from the Windows and NIS databases in days, hours, and minutes. The minimum interval is 5 minutes.-i {yes | no}: Turns simple mapping on (yes) or off (no). By default, mapping is turned on.
add
Creates a new mapping for a user or group. The following options are available with this parameter:-wu : Specifies the name of the Windows user for which a new mapping is being created.-uu : Specifies the name of the UNIX user for which a new mapping is being created.-wg : Specifies the name of the Windows group for which a new mapping is being created.-ug : Specifies the name of the UNIX group for which a new mapping is being created.-setprimary: Specifies that the new mapping is the primary mapping.
setprimary
Specifies which mapping is the primary mapping for a UNIX user or group with multiple mappings. The following options are available with this parameter:-wu : Specifies the Windows user of the primary mapping. If more than one mapping for the user exists, use the -uu option to specify the primary mapping.-uu : Specifies the UNIX user of the primary mapping.-wg : Specifies the Windows group of the primary mapping. If more than one mapping for the group exists, use the -ug option to specify the primary mapping.-ug : Specifies the UNIX group of the primary mapping.
delete
Removes the mapping for a user or group. The following options are available for this parameter:-wu : Specifies the Windows user for which the mapping will be deleted, specified as \.You must specify either the -wu or the -uu option, or both. If you specify both options, the particular mapping identified by the two options will be deleted. If you specify only the -wu option, all mappings for the specified user will be deleted.-uu : Specifies the UNIX user for whom the mapping will be deleted, specified as .You must specify either the -wu or the -uu option, or both. If you specify both options, the particular mapping identified by the two options will be deleted. If you specify only the -uu option, all mappings for the specified user will be deleted.-wg : Specifies the Windows group for which the mapping will be deleted, specified as \.You must specify either the -wg or the -ug option, or both. If you specify both options, the particular mapping identified by the two options will be deleted. If you specify only the -wg option, all mappings for the specified group will be deleted.-ug : Specifies the UNIX group for which the mapping will be deleted, specified as .You must specify either the -wg or the -ug option, or both. If you specify both options, the particular mapping identified by the two options will be deleted. If you specify only the -ug option, all mappings for the specified group will be deleted.
list
Displays information about user and group mappings. The following options are available with this parameter:-all: Lists both simple and advanced mappings for users and groups.-simple: Lists all simple mapped users and groups.-advanced: Lists all advanced mapped users and groups. Maps are listed in the order in which they are evaluated. Primary maps, marked with an asterisk (*), are listed first, followed by secondary maps, which are marked with a carat (^).-wu : Lists the mapping for a specified Windows user.-wg : Lists the mapping for a Windows group.-uu : Lists the mapping for a UNIX user.-ug : Lists the mapping for a UNIX group.
backup
Saves User Name Mapping configuration and mapping data to the file specified by .
restore
Replaces configuration and mapping data with data from the file (specified by ) that was created using the backup parameter.
adddomainmap
Adds a simple map between a Windows domain and an NIS domain or password and group files. The following options are available for this parameter:-d : Specifies the Windows domain to be mapped.-y : Specifies the NIS domain to be mapped. You must use the -n  parameter to specify the NIS server for the NIS domain specified by the -y option.-f : Specifies the fully-qualified path of directory containing the password and group files to be mapped. The files must be located on the computer being managed, and you can't use mapadmin to manage a remote computer to set up maps based on password and group files.
removedomainmap
Removes a simple map between a Windows domain and an NIS domain. The following options and argument are available for this parameter:-d : Specifies the Windows domain of the map to be removed.-y : Specifies the NIS domain of the map to be removed.-all: Specifies that all simple maps between Windows and NIS domains are to be removed. This will also remove any simple map between a Windows domain and password and group files.
listdomainmaps
Lists the Windows domains that are mapped to NIS domains or password and group files.
