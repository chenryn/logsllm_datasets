User: I am working on a mac, a quick question, could someone told me the difference of these two directories? 
/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/site-packages/
/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/
Assistant: python.org
The installer from python.org installs to /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/, and only that python executable looks in the contained site-package dir for packages.
/Library/Python
In contrast, the dir /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/ is a global place where you can put python packages, all python 2.7 interpreter will. (For example the python 2.7 that comes with OS X).
~/Library/Python
The dir ~/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages, if it exists, is also used but for your user only.
sys.path
From within python, you can check, which directories are currently used by import sys; print(sys.path)
homebrew
Note, a python installed via homebrew, will put it's site-packages in $(brew --prefix)/lib/python2.7/site-packages but also be able to import packages from /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages and ~/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages.
