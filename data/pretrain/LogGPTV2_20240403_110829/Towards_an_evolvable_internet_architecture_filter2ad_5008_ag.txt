Within the naming [36, 46, 47], addressing [13, 37], and robustness [12] domains, several issues plague the current architecture. These include name resolution [16], quality of service (QoS) [6], congestion control [8, 44, 45], security [2, 3, 17], routing [43], mobility [7, 35], and intermittent connectivity. The literature is replete with proposals for architectural solutions that address these problems, often bridging the gap to the next generation of IP support, such as IPvM.

General techniques like tunneling and anycast forwarding can enable IPvM and PIM-SSM to run natively, even with partial deployment. This framework allows SSM to be universally accessible, meaning multicast traffic can be forwarded through the (S, G) tree, constructed as described. Packets are picked up by the Designated Router (DR) of the source, S, and forwarded through the group, G.
