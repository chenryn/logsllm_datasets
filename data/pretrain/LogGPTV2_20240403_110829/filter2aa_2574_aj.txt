these pages (results) to search engine servers that organize the results in a search index. 
The search index contains hundreds of billions of indexed pages. Finally, a user submits 
a search query, and the search engine responds by ranking pages that match the user 
query and returning an ordered list (see Figure 3-1).
Figure 3-1. How search engines index websites (source: www.darknessgate.com)
Note! If you want to understand how search engines index websites, Google 
offers a simple tutorial describing this issue. You can find it at https://www.
google.com/search/howsearchworks/.
As of November 2017, Google is aware of about 130 trillion pages. The numbers 
change continually because of the fast-changing nature of the Web.

As mentioned, search engine web crawlers discover new pages through clicking 
links. However, this method is not perfect, and a vast volume of data will remain 
unindexed as search engines crawlers cannot reach them through web crawlers.
As an example, say you want to know the Canadian dollar exchange rate in the 
year 2000. There are many websites that offer currency exchange rates over time. So, 
for this example, you go to the www.xe.com website to see the Canadian exchange 
rate in the year 2000. But wait, there is a problem here. If you want to act as a regular 
search engine crawler, you can only click hyperlinks! But this will not give you the 
result you need. However, if you act as a human and went to the search form at  
www.xe.com/currencytables and entered the specific search date (2000/01/01) 
and clicked the Submit button, then the website would retrieve the historical result 
from its database and present it to you (see Figure 3-2). This result cannot be fetched 
using conventional search engines because it requires you to use a search box on the 
website and enter a search query to retrieve it. The fetched result is a clear example of 
deep web content.

Many Internet users—and even some experts—use the terms deep web and darknet 
synonymously, but there is a difference between them. The term deep web describes all the 
online resources that are not indexed using conventional search engines such as Google, 
Bing, or Yahoo, but the deep web can still be accessed like any regular website using the 
standard HTTP/HTTPS web protocol and typical web browsers without using any special 
software. Any Internet user has certainly used some type of deep web while browsing the 
Internet; however, most users may not know that such resources belong to the deep web.
Deep web resources are usually buried within databases accessible to online public 
view, but the user needs to type a query (for example, into a web search form) or use a 
Figure 3-2. Historical data extracted from a website’s database is an example of 
deep web data

drop-down menu to set some search values to retrieve the contents of these databases. 
This is what makes its contents hidden; it cannot be seen by typical search engines because 
it cannot be accessed through hyperlinks. The same thing applies to websites that require 
registration (username and password) to access content and websites that are purposefully 
designed to keep search crawlers out. Encrypted networks and websites that require 
payment to view content also fall under the category of the deep web. No one can know 
the accurate volume of deep web websites because of the ever-changing nature of web 
content, but many studies suggest that it is approximately 500 times that of the surface web.
Here are some examples of major deep web websites:
• 
The Library of Congress (https://www.loc.gov) This is the largest 
national library in the world, it includes a huge collections of 
resources -like books, photographs, newspapers archive, maps and 
manuscripts- in different topics.
• 
Vital Records (www.vitalrec.com) gives access to U.S. birth 
certificates, death records, and marriage licenses.
• 
Science.gov (https://www.science.gov) gives access to more than 
200 million pages of authoritative federal science information.
• 
Alexa (https://www.alexa.com) gives detailed analytical information 
about websites.
• 
Directory of Open Access Journals (https://doaj.org) gives access 
to high-quality, open-access, peer-reviewed journals.
• 
The Online Books Page (http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu) 
gives free access to more than two million books that are accessible 
(and readable) on the Internet.
As you already saw, finding content on the deep web is not a straightforward task for 
a typical user, and most of the valuable deep web contents must be extracted manually. 
However, there are many approaches to simplifying this task:
• 
Specialized search engines: This includes any search engine that 
helps you locate deep web content within one subject or more. The 
following are some examples:
a. https://www.doi.org helps you to resolve the digital object 
identifier (DOI) of any publication.
ChApTer 3  The UNderGroUNd INTerNeT
100
b. https://www.100searchengines.com contains specialized 
search engines for almost any topic online. It allows you to 
search multiple search engines at the same time (although 
searching multiple search engines at the same time may omit 
some results because not all search engines use the same 
mechanism to fetch data from their index).
c. https://books.google.com/?hl=en is one of the biggest deep 
web databases that contains millions of books. Google includes 
results from this database when conducting regular searches.
d. www.academicindex.net is a scholarly academic search 
engine accessing only a selected set of websites that are 
specialized in academic and research papers.
e. https://www.truthfinder.com searches social media, photos, 
police records, background checks, contact information, and 
more. The result will be fetched from TruthFinder’s database 
of deep web sources.
• 
Web directories: A directory is a website that shows a list of websites 
organized into categories. A user enters a search query, and the 
directory gives the user the relative subjects to the entered query. 
Each subject may contain hundreds and even thousands of websites 
that fall into that category. To browse a directory, a user selects the 
topic and then moves down from the broadest to the narrowest. 
Some directories are paid, while others are free and maintained by 
a community of volunteer editors. Web directories are smaller than 
search engines as they are maintained by humans, unlike search 
engines, which are mainly maintained by spiders (web crawlers). The 
following are some famous web directories:
a. https://www.hotfrog.com.au is the largest online business 
directory; it lists 120 million businesses in 38 countries.
b. www.akama.com is a U.S. business directory.
c. http://vlib.org is the WWW Virtual Library.
d. http://dmoztools.net closed in March 2017. It is still 
considered the largest web directory online.

• 
Internet of Things (IoT) search engines: The term Internet of Things 
is used to describe any device that can connect to the Internet and 
can collect and exchange data. The list of devices includes routers, 
servers, traffic lights, cell phones, coffee makers, washing machines, 
headphones, lamps, wearable devices such as watches, security systems 
including alarms, Wi-Fi cameras, baby monitors, smart refrigerators, 
smart TV sets, smart air-conditioning systems that can adjust the 
heat remotely, and almost anything else you can imagine that can be 
connected to the Internet and controlled remotely. Shodan (https://
www.shodan.io) is a sophisticated search engine that specializes in 
searching Internet-connected devices through finding where they are 
located and who is using them. Shodan collects data mostly on these 
ports: HTTP (80), FTP (21), SSH (22), Telnet (23), and SNMP (161). 
Shodan allows both individuals and corporations to secure their IoT 
devices by discovering which one is vulnerable to outside attack or 
misconfiguration (for example, still uses the default manufacturer 
username and password). This search engine can be used effectively to 
find information about active IoT devices worldwide.
Now, we have reached to the third layer of the Web. This is the deepest one and 
called the darknet. The darknet—or dark web—is an online resource that has been 
designed purposefully to be hidden and anonymous. The darknet forms a small part of 
the deep web, but unlike the deep web, this one cannot be accessed using typical web 
browsers. It needs special software to access it such as Tor (short for The Onion Router).
Darknet—or anonymity—networks are composed of collections of computers 
spread all over the world that form a decentralized web. These anonymity networks form 
collectively what is known as the darknet. Users can access these networks to surf the 
Web anonymously or to visit the anonymous hidden websites within these networks.
Individuals get to the darknet for various purposes, and a significant number of them 
are unlawful. While there are no accurate statistics on the quantity of illicit sites (called 
Tor services or hidden services on the Tor Network), the Intelliagg group in 2015 reviewed 
more than 1,000 samples of Tor hidden services and found that 68 percent of Tor darknet 
contents are unlawful.iii Criminals are not only visiting the darknet to look for illegal 
products but are utilizing it as a medium to anonymize their online correspondences 
and keep others from following them when utilizing the surface web. Still, even though 
most darknet websites are associated with illegal activities, many people utilize it for 
ChApTer 3  The UNderGroUNd INTerNeT
102
legitimate purposes (for example, using a Tor Browser to conceal a user IP and machine 
digital footprint when surfing the ordinary Internet). 
There are different anonymity networks. The following are the most popular:
• 
Tor Network (https://www.torproject.org/index.html.en)
• 
I2P network (https://geti2p.net/en/)
• 
Freenet (https://freenetproject.org/index.html)
As you already saw, deep web resources can be found by searching for them within 
target websites or by using specialized search engines, directories, and other online 
paid services that offer access to nonfree contents (such as gray literature). The same 
thing does not apply to the darknet. As an OSINT analyst, you need to understand where 
to start your darknet investigations and how to access and search within the darknet. 
OSINT investigators usually use darknet networks—especially the Tor Network—to 
browse the surface web anonymously. This will effectively help them to conceal their 
online activities from outside observers (see Figure 3-3). The rest of this chapter will 
explore what the darknet is and how to access and exploit its resources.

 Darknet Users
Darknet has a bad reputation for being the preferred place for malicious actors to 
conduct their criminal activities online. The following are some bad actors:
• 
Drug dealers exploit the anonymity feature of the darknet to conduct 
their illegal sales safely.
• 
Arm dealers use the darknet for illegal buying and selling of weapons.
• 
People buy false government papers (such as passports and national IDs).
• 
Black hat hackers use it to download and share exploit tools; sell ready- 
to- launch distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, ransomware, 
and security exploits; and offer espionage services to customers.
• 
Terrorists use the darknet to share information and trade unlawful 
goods in addition to concealing their activities on the surface web.
• 
Gambling and betting websites are on the darknet.
• 
Sellers of stolen information—such as corporate secrets, credit card 
numbers, and the personal information of people obtained during 
fraudulent activities—use the darknet to sell their stolen information 
to interested parties.
Even though many darknet sites are directed toward criminal activities, there are 
many legal uses for the darknet. Some of these include the following:
• 
Human rights activists, journalists, and whistleblowers use it to reveal 
secret contents to the public without uncovering their identity.
• 
Privacy advocates use the darknet anonymously away from 
governments and corporate surveillance.
• 
Law enforcement uses the darknet for different purposes (e.g., 
tracking criminals and collecting information about them).
• 
Individuals, governments, and corporations use anonymity networks 
as a secure medium to exchange top-secret information.
ChApTer 3  The UNderGroUNd INTerNeT
104
• 
Intelligence services and military organizations use the darknet to 
gather open source intelligence information and to counter terrorism 
activities.
• 
Business corporations may monitor darknet forums and blogs to see 
their own leaked proprietary information.
Maybe you wonder how traders do their business anonymously on the darknet. The 
answer is simple. Every dark website accepts payment via bitcoins. We already covered 
the concept of cryptocurrency in Chapter 2; bitcoin (https://www.bitcoin.com) is the 
most popular one and can be used to conduct online money transactions anonymously.
 Accessing the Darknet
The Tor Network is the most popular anonymous network in the world, so we will focus 
on it in this chapter to describe the darknet. However, before we begin, remember the 
essential precautionary steps upon accessing the darknet.
Note! Although accessing the Tor Network is considered legal in most countries, 
its usage can arouse suspicion with the law. And some countries consider 
accessing the Tor Network as an illegal practice that can lead to questions by 
authorities. A rule by the U.S. Supreme Court gives permission to the FBI to search 
and seize any computer around the world that is found using the Tor Network or 
even a VpN service.iv Make sure to read the section on how to conceal your Tor 
usage in the previous chapter.
 Security Checks When Accessing the Darknet
Chapter 2 was dedicated entirely to personal cybersecurity; however, it is worth 
remembering the following main points before accessing the darknet (detailed descriptions 
on how each precaution works technically are available in the previous chapter):
• 
Make your entry to the Tor Network hidden by using pluggable 
transports, custom bridges, or a VPN before starting your Tor 
Browser.
ChApTer 3  The UNderGroUNd INTerNeT
105
• 
Cover your webcam and microphone.
• 
Prepare your anonymous e-mail (like the Protonmail.com service) or 
use a free disposal e-mail service.
• 
Generate a false digital identity in case you need to register at some 
websites to access some locked contents. Make sure not to use any 
personal details that relate to you.
• 
Make sure that your Tor Browser is up-to-date to avoid leaking your 
real IP address—the Tor Browser will warn users to update it upon 
launch in case it becomes outdated.
• 
Make sure that your OS and antivirus software are up-to-date. 
The presence of a dedicated anti-malware software is highly 
recommended.
• 
Disable JavaScript on your Tor Browser by activating the NoScript 
add-on that comes preinstalled with the Tor Browser (see Figure 3-4).
Figure 3-4. Disabling JavaScript on all websites before accessing the dark web
• 
It is advisable to change your online identity and hence the IP 
address for each visited site on the dark web, as in Figure 3-5. 
Selecting the New Identity option will require restarting the Tor 
Browser and lose the current session.
ChApTer 3  The UNderGroUNd INTerNeT
106
• 
Do not download anything from the darknet to your computer, 
especially software and pirated media such as songs and movies.
• 
Be suspicious before clicking any hyperlink because you do not know 
who operates darknet websites and the destination that such links 
will take you to.
 Accessing the Darknet from Within the Surface Web
Some websites offer a functionality to access the Tor hidden websites (hidden services) 
from within the surface web—using regular browsers—without using the Tor Browser 
or Tor software. The following list shows some websites that connect Internet users to 
content hosted inside the Tor Network. Bear in mind that accessing the darknet in this 
way does not guarantee that you can surf it as you would do with the Tor Browser. This 
method is more convenient—for a casual user—to surf the Tor Network easily. However, 
you will lose the anonymity that Internet users seek when using the Tor Browser in 
addition to making your browsing history susceptible to interception.

Warning! If you want to access the darknet (Tor Network) from within regular 
web browsers using proxy websites, make sure to encrypt your connection first 
using a VpN.

 Using Tor
We already covered how the Tor Network works in Chapter 2; however, we will give you a 
brief description of how data flow works within this network.
Tor sends user requests across many relays (also known as a server or router); 
usually, at least three relays are used. The entire connection within these relays is 
encrypted. The first relay establishes the user connection to the Tor Network. This relay 
knows your current location, so it is advisable to use a VPN connection first to mask this 
or to use custom bridges/pluggable transports to mask your entry to the Tor Network 
from your ISP/government or any other outside adversary.
The second relay knows that the data is coming from the first relay, the third relay 
knows that the data is coming from the second rely, and so on. The last relay—also 
known as the exit relay—cannot know the origin of the data.
Tor relays do not record any activity pass through them, and all connections within 
these relays are totally encrypted. However, the weakest link resides on the last relay—
the exit relay—as this relay can intercept data flowing through it if it is not already 
encrypted. There are some cases when this relay got comprised by intruders to unmask 
Tor users and to sniff their unencrypted traffic.
To mitigate the risk of someone intercepting your data at the exit relay, you should 
encrypt everything before sending it across the Tor Network. The Tor Browser comes 
with an add-on named HTTPS Everywhere (https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere) 
that forces your browser to encrypt your communication transparently—with major 
websites using the SSL protocol.
Websites hosted on the Tor Network end with the .onion extension. Unlike normal 
web addresses that end with .com or .net, Tor websites can be accessed only through the 
Tor Browser.
To access the Tor Network, all you need to do is to download and use the Tor 
Browser; you can always download the latest version from https://www.torproject.
org/download/download. Download the version that matches your current OS and 
then launch the browser. The Tor Browser is a hardened version of Firefox that comes 
occupied with the Tor software to enable transparent access to the Tor Network. The Tor 
Browser can also be used to browse the public Internet.

If you do not know where to start after launching the Tor Browser, go to the hidden 
wiki (see Figure 3-6) at http://zqktlwi4fecvo6ri.onion/wiki/index.php/Main_Page. 
This site provides a directory of the most active darknet websites organized into 
categories. Bear in mind that some websites may not work instantly; however, this does 
not mean the darknet is offline. Many websites run for specific number of hours daily, so 
return and visit later.
Figure 3-6. The hidden wiki—beginner entry to the darknet
Tor was primarily created to allow users to access regular (surface) Internet 
anonymously. This fact is considered a disadvantage for it when compared with other 
anonymity networks (like I2P, which was created as a stand-alone network within the
