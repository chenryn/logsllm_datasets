User: Running Windows 7.  2.7, 3.3 and 3.4 installed.
I just installed Python 3.3 for a recent project.  In the command prompt, python launches 3.4, and py launches 3.3.  I can access 3.3 using the 3.3 version of IDLE, but how can I access it via the command prompt?
Is there a shortcut like py that I can use?  Do I need to define this on my own like an alias?
Or is the best route to somehow change the path to temporarily make 3.3 the default?
Just downloaded virtualenv, maybe that might be part of the solution.
Assistant: If you want to male a file specifically open with a version you can start the file with #! python3.x the x being the version you want. If you want to be able to right click and edit with that version youll need to do some tweaking in the registry
