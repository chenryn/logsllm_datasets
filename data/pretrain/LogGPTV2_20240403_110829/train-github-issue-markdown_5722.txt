I'm not sure if this is a bug or not but the behavior doesn't make sense. I'm
using a model driven form on my page and one of the controls has two
synchronous validators (required and minlength) and a custom asyncValidator.
When the page initially loads the form control is empty so it should be
failing the required and minlength validations. The custom validator will
return valid when the field is empty. However, the state of the control is
being set Valid on form initialization. Previously my custom async validator
had been a synchronous validator and it worked as expected, i.e. the custom
validator is initially valid but the form control is still invalid due to the
other validations being invalid.
The following plnkr illustrates the behavior:

Also, note that the after form initialization the async validator only runs
after satisfying the minlength requirement (in this case upon typing the 6th
character) while the sync validator runs on every key press and the sync
validator is run twice on form initialization while the async validator only
runs once. Another thing is that the form control with the async validator
will report invalid if you type some characters then delete them all making
the field empty.
