Bluetooth
● IEEE 802.15.1
● Low Power / Short Range
● Ad-Hoc (Piconet)
● Deployed on over 1 billions devices worldwide

Cloning/Spoofing Profile
● Bluetooth Profile:
– Device Address, Device Class, Device Name
● Bluetooth Profile Cloning:
– Modify host Bluetooth Adapter profile to match 
the profile of another device
– Done manually using hciconfig and bdaddr
● Bluetooth Profile Spoofing:
– Creating a misleading profile of host Bluetooth 
Adapter

SpoofTooph
● Automate / simplify Bluetooth profile 
modification process
● Useful for
– Obfuscation
– Impersonations
– Observation
● 5 different modes
© Shadow Cave LLC
SpoofTooph
● Mode 1: > spooftooph -i hci0 -s -d scan.log
– Scan local area for devices
– Save list of devices found
– Select a device from the list to clone
● Mode 2: > spooftooph -i hci0 -r
– Randomly generate Bluetooth profile
● Device Class – Random Valid Class
● Device Name - 100 most popular Ameraican 
names + device type
● Device Addr – Random MAC

SpoofTooph
● Mode 3: > spooftooph -i hci0 -n new_name -a 
00:11:22:33:44:55 -c 0x4a010c
– Specify Name, Class, and Address
● Mode 4: > spooftooph -i hci0 -l scan.log
– Read in previously logged scan
– Select a device from the list to clone
● Mode 5: > spooftooph -i hci0 -t 10
– Incognito: Scan for devices every X seconds 
and clone the first profile on the list

Bluetooth Profiling Project
● Collect Device Name, Device Address and 
Device Class on as many devices as possible
● Same idea as Josh Wright's Bnap,Bnap, but 
collecting device profiles from others devices 
instead
● Collected over 1,500 device profiles so far

Bluetooth Profiling Project
● Use for this data:
– Mapping the address range of Bluetooth
● Improve Redfang discovery scans
● Matching address range with device model
– Research
– Discovering information disclosure
© Shadow Cave LLC
Bluetooth Profiling Project
● Disclosure of sensitive information
● What information can be gathered from the 
device profile?
– Can the Device Address be used to identify the 
device modes?
– What can be extracted from the device name?
© Shadow Cave LLC
Bluetooth Profiling Project
● Can the Device Address be used to identify the 
device modes?
– Yes, the addresses used for Device Address 
(MAC) are the same as those used by 
Ethernet or ZigBee
– The first 24-bits are Organizationally Unique 
Identifiers (OUI), registered to specific entities, 
often often use a subset of those address 
ranges for a specific model of device
– The reverse can be done to attempt to guess 
the address based on the device model

Bluetooth Profiling Project
● What can be extracted from the device name?
– First Name – A first name, presumably the first 
name of the device owner.  
– Last Name – A last name, presumably the last 
name of the device owner.  
– Nickname – What appears to be a user name or 
'handle'.  
– Location – Information that can be used to 
determine the location of the device.
– Device Model – Identifying information that could 
lead to profiling the device as a specific model.

Mall Nibbling
Dropping by your local mall to collect information 
on the cornucopia of Bluetooth devices.

Mall Nibbling
● Performing Mall Nibbling: Things to Know
– Come equipped with a Class 1 bluetooth dongle 
(cantenna attachment optional, but 
recommended :) ) 
– Obfuscate your Bluetooth interface
– While device discovery takes less then 2 
seconds, getting the name of the device 
requires a follow up request.  Plan on 
spending at least 1 minute per location for 
each scan.

vCardBlaster
● vCard - “Virtual Business Card”
– Used to exchange personal information 
● Many Bluetooth devices allow exchange of 
vCards 
– Phones, PDAs, PCs, etc
© Shadow Cave LLC
vCardBlaster
● vCardBlaster is capable of sending a constant 
stream of vCards over Bluetooth
– Users can select a single target or attack all 
devices in range 
– vCards can be specified or generated by 
vCardBlaster

Bluetooth vCard Contact List DoS
● vCardBlaster can be used to preform a DoS on 
a Contact List
● Vuln:
– Some devices, upon receiving a vCard, will 
automatically add the information to the local 
Contact List.
– Each name provided in the vCard must be 
unique.
– Sending a flood of vCards fills up the contact list 
with new false contacts

Blueper
● Blueper is capable of sending a constant 
stream of files over Bluetooth
– Users can select a single target or attack all 
devices in range 
– Files can be specified or generated
– User can specify file size
© Shadow Cave LLC
Bluetooth OBEX Disk Cache DoS
● Blueper can be used to preform a DoS using 
the systems caching of file data
● Vuln:
– Some devices cache files sent over Bluetooth 
OBEX before prompting user to accept or 
reject the file transfer.
– Sending files over extended periods of time can 
fill up disk.
– It can cause system crash.

Pwntooth
● Suite of Bluetooth attack tools
● Designed to automate multiple attacks against 
multiple targets.
● Comes bundled with tools like: 
– Bluetooth Stack Smasher
– BT_AUDIT
– Bluesnrf
– Blueper / vCardBlaster
© Shadow Cave LLC
Pwntooth
● Pwntooth uses a user defined config file as an 
attack script
● This config file uses * as a wild card character 
for device address
© Shadow Cave LLC
pwntooth.conf
© Shadow Cave LLC
Pwntooth
● Default config /etc/bluetooth/pwntooth.conf
● If a address device is detected in multiple 
iterations of scans, the attacks listed in the 
config file are only run the first time
● Example: Scan area 10 times and save output 
to logfile.txt using default config. 
> pwntooth -l logfile.txt -s 10
