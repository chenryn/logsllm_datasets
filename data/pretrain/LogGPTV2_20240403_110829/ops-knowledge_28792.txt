Assistant: This log chunk shows the DataNode and NameSystem components of a distributed file system communicating with each other. The DataNode components are receiving blocks of size 67108864 from various sources, and the NameSystem component is updating the blockMap with the IP addresses of the DataNode components. The PacketResponder components are also terminating.
