User: What would be the best way to execute shell commands on remote servers and get output without actually logging in. 
Maybe with shh keys. Preferably with python.
Assistant: Paramiko is really good and convenient for transferring files and executing commands in remote server. 
But, the problem is that we won't be able to catch the output of the command. It will be difficult to understand whether the command executed properly or not.
