**ATT&CK ID:** G0122  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Silent Librarian

**Description:**
Silent Librarian, a threat actor, has been known to acquire domains for the purpose of establishing credential harvesting pages. These pages often mimic the target organization's legitimate websites and frequently use free top-level domains (TLDs) such as .TK, .ML, .GA, .CF, and .GQ. This tactic is designed to deceive victims into entering their credentials on what they believe to be a trusted site, thereby enabling the attacker to collect sensitive information.
