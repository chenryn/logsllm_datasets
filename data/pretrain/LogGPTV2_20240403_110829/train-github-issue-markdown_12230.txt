### Performance and Error Issues with `df.T.duplicated()` in Pandas 0.16.0 and 0.16.1

**Summary:**
- The following code runs efficiently in Pandas 0.15.2 but encounters performance issues with the `df.T.duplicated()` operation in versions 0.16.0 and 0.16.1.
- Additionally, on a private dataset that works correctly in 0.15.2, an error occurs in 0.16.0 and 0.16.1 during the same `df.T.duplicated()` operation.

**Code:**

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Small DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame({'A': [1 for x in range(1000)],
                   'B': [1 for x in range(1000)]})

print(np.count_nonzero(df.duplicated()))
print(np.count_nonzero(df.T.duplicated()))

# Large DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame({'A': [1 for x in range(1000000)],
                   'B': [1 for x in range(1000000)]})

print(np.count_nonzero(df.duplicated()))
print(np.count_nonzero(df.T.duplicated()))
```

**Error on Private Dataset:**
- The error has not yet been reproduced with synthetic data, but it occurs on a private dataset.
- The error message is as follows:

```python
File "C:\Anaconda3\lib\site-packages\pandas\util\decorators.py", line 88, in wrapper
    return func(*args, **kwargs)
  File "C:\Anaconda3\lib\site-packages\pandas\core\frame.py", line 2867, in duplicated
    labels, shape = map(list, zip(*map(f, vals)))
  File "C:\Anaconda3\lib\site-packages\pandas\core\frame.py", line 2856, in f
    labels, shape = factorize(vals, size_hint=min(len(self), _SIZE_HINT_LIMIT))
  File "C:\Anaconda3\lib\site-packages\pandas\core\algorithms.py", line 135, in factorize
    labels = table.get_labels(vals, uniques, 0, na_sentinel)
  File "pandas\hashtable.pyx", line 813, in pandas.hashtable.PyObjectHashTable.get_labels (pandas\hashtable.c:14025)
ValueError: Buffer has wrong number of dimensions (expected 1, got 2)
```

**Conclusion:**
- The `df.T.duplicated()` operation exhibits a performance issue in Pandas 0.16.0 and 0.16.1.
- A `ValueError` is raised on a private dataset in these versions, which does not occur in 0.15.2.
