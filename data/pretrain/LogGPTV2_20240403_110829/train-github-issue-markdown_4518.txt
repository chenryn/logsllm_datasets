A checkbox or toggle in the General Settings page to disable the Power Toys system tray icon would be useful. 

Alternatively, and perhaps more effectively (although it would require more development work), a Power Toy could be created to enable or disable all system tray icons. This would be particularly beneficial since some applications do not provide an option to completely disable their system tray icons.
