I have developed a basic Flutter plugin, which can be found at the following GitHub repository:  
[https://github.com/shehabic/dhplugin](https://github.com/shehabic/dhplugin)  

This plugin is utilized in the module located here:  
[https://github.com/shehabic/flutter-test-module](https://github.com/shehabic/flutter-test-module)  

The purpose of this module is to serve as a central repository for all custom plugins that our company will develop. By importing this module into our existing applications, we can easily incorporate all of our custom plugins.

Despite spending five days troubleshooting, I have been unable to resolve the issues. Below are the details and steps to reproduce the problem:

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Clone the module from the repository: [https://github.com/shehabic/flutter-test-module](https://github.com/shehabic/flutter-test-module)
2. Run `flutter packages get` to fetch the dependencies.
3. Execute `flutter build ios --debug` to build the iOS app.
