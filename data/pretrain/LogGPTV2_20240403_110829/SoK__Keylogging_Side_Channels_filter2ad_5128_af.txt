the application which, if too large, may be noticeable to some
users. Longer delays enable greater obfuscation ability at the
expense of a reduction in perceived application responsiveness.
VI. DISCUSSION
The keylogging side channel attacks in Table II summarize
nearly two decades of research, which has it roots toward the
end of WWII [2] and seems to have advanced considerably
behind closed doors during the Cold War era as evidenced
by revelations such as the Selectric Bug [1]. Comparatively,
there is a much smaller body of research directed towards
keylogging side channel defenses (Table III), none of which
have been widely adopted. This may change in the near future,
as some low-cost (in terms of usability, performance overhead,
and cost of deployment) countermeasures against host-based
and network-based attacks have recently emerged [10], [89].
It is worth noting, keylogging attacks that exploit device
behavior, such as EM emanations and cache usage, generally
achieve higher performance than those that exploit human
behavior, such as smartwatch motion and packet timing. Ar-
guably, this gap is due to differences in regularity between user
and device behavior. An attack that exploits microarchitectural
side effects is expected to work across all devices of the same
make and model, dependent on the highly-consistent behavior
across devices. In contrast, an attack that exploits human
behavior must adapt to changes behavior over time (non-
stationarity) and between users. These observations allude to a
fundamental relationship between behavior homogeneity and
attack severity with regard to side channels, whereby users
and devices who behave contrary to the norm are rewarded
by being less susceptible to attack. On the other hand, doing
so may actually compromise anonymity, i.e., enable behavior-
based identiﬁcation, an issue not considered in this work.
Temporal keylogging side channels actually exploit a well-
established phenomenon in transcription typing, that is, differ-
ent users can be expected to operate a keyboard within similar
time constraints, enabling an adversary to make general infer-
ences about user actions based on temporal behavior. For the
touch typist, shorter time intervals usually correspond to keys
that are far apart compared to longer time intervals for keys
that are close together. This is a result of having to reuse the
same ﬁnger or hand for neighboring keys while distant keys
are pressed in quicker succession through parallel processing
by alternate ﬁngers [43]. Consistent with this phenomenon, in
Section III-C3, we found typing speed to be somewhat indica-
tive of how susceptible a user is to a temporal attack whereby
the faster touch typists were more vulnerable. This dichotomy
in performance is reminiscent of the biometric menagerie,
which speciﬁes that biometric identiﬁcation systems work well
for some users (sheep) but are problematic for others (goats)
[94]. Given that some users are more susceptible to temporal
attacks than others, a better understanding of what other user-
speciﬁc factors inﬂuence temporal information gain could shed
some light on new effective countermeasures.
Finally, consistency in HCI behavior across a population
is not restricted to typing, and the presence of temporal
keylogging side channels reﬂects a much broader problem
potentially faced by interactive client-server applications. Sim-
ilar phenomena exist with other modalities, such as Fitts’
Law in navigating the mouse pointer on a computer screen
[95] and more recently Finger-Fitts’ (FFitts) Law for touch
screen behavior [96]. This raises the question as to what
other HCI modalities are subject to such attacks whereby
temporal patterns can reveal user actions, and what defenses
must necessarily be deployed to mitigate this class of human-
based timing side channels. Given the proliferation of real-
time client-server applications, where the real-time constraint
dictates that human input events must propagate to the network
layer, this issue warrants further investigation.
VII. CONCLUSION
The keyboard is ubiquitous in human-computer interaction.
Even with alternatives, such as voice and eye movement, the
keyboard remains an integral device for textual input. This is
likely due to familiarity, speed, and the relative accuracy with
which the keyboard can be operated. Keylogging side channels
will likely remain just as ubiquitous due to the increasing
complexity and sensing capabilities of computing devices.
Physiological signals [48] and microarchitectural side ef-
fects have proven to be especially pervasive [93], with recent
attacks highlighting the copious number of ways to eavesdrop
keyboard input. User actions captured through the keyboard
and other peripheral devices permeate network communication
channels and can have unforeseen side effects on the device.
The difﬁculty in mitigating these types of attacks highlights
the importance of empirical studies to evaluate device security
[92] and calls for deeper understanding of the security and
privacy implications in human-computer interaction.
