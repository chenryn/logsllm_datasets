Abstract—Many office devices have a history of being networked 
(such  as  printers)  and  others  without  the  same  past  are 
increasingly  becoming  networked  (such  as  photocopiers).    The 
modern networked versions of previously non-networked devices 
have  much  in  common  with  traditional  networked  servers  in 
terms of features and functions.  While an organization may have 
policies and procedures for securing traditional network servers, 
securing  networked  office  devices  providing  similar  services  can 
easily  be  overlooked.    In  this  paper  we  present  an  evaluation  of 
privacy  and  security  risks  found  when  examining  over  1,800 
networked office devices connected to a large university network.  
We  use  the  STRIDE  threat  model  to  categorize  threats  and 
vulnerabilities  and  then  we  group  the  devices  according  to 
assessed  risk  from  the  perspective  of  the  university.    We  found 
that  while  steps  had  been  taken  to  secure  some  devices,  many 
were using default or unsecured configurations.

 INTRODUCTION 
Modern  office  devices  such  as  photocopiers  and  printers 
often  have  additional  capabilities  and  features  not  present  in 
older  and  single  function  devices  [1].    Many  photocopier 
machines  can  also  function  as  network  printers  as  well  as 
providing  scanning  and  network  storage  and 
retrieval 
capabilities  [2].    Network  printers  may  also  include  data 
storage  and  retrieval  features.    These  devices  may  also  be 
referred  to  as  multifunction  devices  or  multifunction  printers 
(MFPs). 
These  networked  devices  include  some  type  of  network 
interface  and  basic  operating  system.    In  some  cases,  the 
operating  system  is  based  on  or  is  similar  to  the  operating 
systems  running  on  traditional  personal  computer  (PC)  based 
network servers [3,4,5].  However, since these devices may not 
physically  resemble  traditional  computer  servers,  established 
security practices and measures may be overlooked when they 
are connected to networks [6].  Vendors may also be inclined to 
enable  most  or  all  features  by  default,  leaving  security

decisions to customers and end users.  Once the devices are up 
and running, they may be neglected from a security perspective 
as long as they continue to print, copy, or serve their intended 
purpose.

procurement,  installation,  configuration  and  management  of 
networked  office  devices  is  often  handled  locally  by  units 
within colleges, departments and institutes.  Individuals and/or 
smaller internal research groups may also acquire and use these 
devices  often  without  knowledge  or  oversight  of  security 
practices.    The  focus  is  typically  on  using  the  devices  to 
perform an intended function and not on restricting unintended 
uses  or  unauthorized  access.    Documents  with  personally 
identifiable  information  (PII)  [7]  are  often  photocopied  or 
scanned.    Inadequately  or  improperly  secured  devices  can  in 
some  cases  allow  this  information  to  be  accessible  to 
unauthorized  users.    The  same  or  other  devices  may  also  be 
used by unauthorized users to store and share pirated or stolen 
content. 
Recent  news  outlets  have  discussed  the  security  threats 
related  to  retired  copiers  with  hard  drives  [8,9,10].  These 
devices often still have valuable content on them in the form of 
scanned or copied documents stored on the hard drives.  After 
being resold, in many cases these documents can be recovered 
or accessed. 
These  reports  have  focused  on  what  could  be  accessed 
when  a  person  or  attacker  has  physical  access  to  the  machine 
and its hard drive.  Our study examines what information may 
be  available  while  the  machine  is  in  use  and  connected  to  a 
network.  The information and access examined do not require 
physical access to the machine to obtain or review. 
Our research focuses on identifying some of the risks posed 
by such devices which are accessible on a university network.  
Our objective is to quantify both the prevalence and severity of 
some of the existing known problems in order to form a clearer 
picture  of  the  current  and  existing  risks  posed  from  the 
organization’s  perspective.    We  identify  vulnerable  settings,

categorize the devices based on the overall risks they pose.  We 
consider risks from both privacy and security perspectives. 
For  the  purposes  of  this  paper,  privacy  issues  specifically 
relate  to  the  stored  content  on  the  devices  that  contain  PII  or 
other  information  sensitive  to  the  functions  of  the  university.  
Security  issues  relate  to  other  aspects  that  could  affect 
availability, integrity or abuse of resources—such as being able 
to  modify  configurations  or  use  the  devices  for  unintended 
purposes (such as  a  repository  for pirated,  stolen or  malicious 
files).  The distinction between privacy and security is one that 
is often discussed when applied to higher education institutions 
[11] and is applicable to other institutions (such as healthcare) 
that handle PII. 
We use the STRIDE [12,13] threat model to identify threats 
as the model contains components for both security and privacy 
aspects.    Based  on  identified  threats,  we  then  examine  and 
evaluate vulnerabilities present in the devices relevant to these 
threats.    We  then categorize the  devices into  groups based on 
their  assessed  risk.    The  objective  of  this  practical  experience 
report  is  to  determine  if  there  are  significant  privacy  and 
security  risks  present  due  to  networked  office  devices  in  use 
and  connected  to  the  campus  network,  and  if  so,  to  create  a

A.  Identification of devices 
The  university  network  to  which  the  office  devices  are 
attached can include over 40,000 unique active IP addresses at 
any  time.    The  first  step  we  needed  to  explore  was  how  to 
easily  and  quickly  identify  which  active  members  of  the 
network  were  the  type  of  devices  (printers,  photocopiers, 
scanners) we wanted to examine and assess.  These devices are

dispersed  throughout  many  of  the  colleges,  departments,  and 
units which are attached to the campus network.  These devices 
are  usually  procured,  deployed  and  managed  locally  and  not 
centrally by the university. 
We  employed  two  different  tools  for  identifying  such 
devices.    We  used  the  security  scanner  nmap  [14]  (version 
5.21)  to  discover  which  hosts  on  the  campus  network  were 
likely to be networked office devices.  Nmap provided us with 
information  regarding  the  accessibility  of  the  host  along  with 
status (open/closed/filtered) of different network ports. In some 
cases  it  could  also  provide  details  regarding  the  operating 
system  on  the target  and  the versions of  the  services listening 
on  open  ports.    The  scan  results  used  for  analysis  were 
performed from an on-campus location.  However, some scans 
were  also  performed  from  off-campus  to  compare  and  verify 
results  and  to  gain  insight  into  what  an  off-campus  attacker 
would be able to determine.  
Because of the number of initial hosts to be scanned, we did 
not include scanning of all ports on reachable hosts.  We came 
up with a list of seven TCP ports to initially include in the scan.  
Since  many  networked  printers  and  photocopiers  have  TCP 
ports 515 [15] and 9100 [16] open, we focused on identifying 
hosts with these two ports open. While these two ports would 
be  open  to  facilitate  printing  to  the  devices,  we  also  included 
scanning  for  other  TCP  ports  which  correspond  to  network 
services  which  may  be  running  on  the  devices  to  assist  with 
remote  administration  of  the  devices  and/or  allowing  remote 
access to documents stored on the devices.  For example, TCP 
port  514  is  often  enabled  by  default  on  many  Ricoh  Aficio 
multifunction  devices  and  these  models  often  have  the 
document  server  function  also  enabled  by  default.    The 
presence  of  this  open  port  along  with  some  of  the  common 
printing  ports  can  provide  a  rough  fingerprint  for  these 
particular  devices.  Table I  summarizes  the targeted ports  and
