User: I'm new to python, I'm using Windows 10 and have  python36  and I basically have to use nltk for my project and i basically have two questions.

1 I heard pip is automatically downloaded for versions 3+ but when I type pip install nltk in command prompt im getting the following error even though i added its path "C:\Users\dheeraj\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36\Scripts\pip36" in advanced settings and ya in above path i tried pip36 and pip in both cases result is same.

'pip' is not recognized as an internal or external command,"

2 In www.nltk.org I found nltk for mac, unix and windows32 but not for windows64 ,does that mean it doesnt support for 64bit or is there any way for me to install nltk.
Assistant: Directly Search for pip folder and navigate throught that path example:
C:\Users\PAVAN\Environments\my_env\Lib\site-packages\pip> 
Run cmd
and then run the command 
    pip install -U nltk
