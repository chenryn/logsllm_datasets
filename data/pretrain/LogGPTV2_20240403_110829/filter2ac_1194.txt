**ATT&CK ID:** T1547.015  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Login Items

Adversaries may add login items to a system in order to execute specific applications, documents, folders, or server connections automatically upon user login. This technique can be used for gaining persistence or escalating privileges. 

Login items can be added through two primary methods:
1. **Shared File List:** Adversaries can use scripting languages such as AppleScript to set and manage login items.
2. **Service Management Framework (SMF):** The SMF provides an API call, `SMLoginItemSetEnabled`, which can be used to enable or disable login items programmatically.

By leveraging these methods, adversaries can ensure that their malicious code is executed each time a user logs into the system, thereby maintaining a persistent presence or elevating their privileges.
