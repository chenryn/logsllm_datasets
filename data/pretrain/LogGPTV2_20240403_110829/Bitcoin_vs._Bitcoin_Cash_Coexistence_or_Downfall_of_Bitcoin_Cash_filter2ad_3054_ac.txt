mining, and mining powers of coinA and coinB are stably
maintained. On the other hand, if rB is cstick, only coinB-
factions Ωstick would conduct coinB-mining after an increase
in the mining difﬁculty of coinB. In other words, in this case,
only the factions remain as loyal miners for coinB. Therefore,
if the number of such factions (|Ωstick|) is small, the state
would be a lack of loyal miners. Note that loyal miners refer
to players who continue to conduct coinB-mining even after
an increase in coinB-mining. In particular, if all coinB-factions
stop coinB-mining for higher payoff (i.e., |Ωstick| = 0), rB is
0, and no player conducts coinB-mining after an increase in
the mining difﬁculty of coinB. Note that the coinB-mining
difﬁculty cannot decrease in this case because Nde cannot
be zero. Therefore, the case rB = 0 indicates the complete
downfall of coinB while only coinA survives.
Parameters used in this paper are summarized in Table I.
The last parameter in the table will be introduced later.

and Nin are deﬁned in Assumption 2 and 3.
Note that fε(cstick) is 1 − cstick for a small value of cstick
while fε(cstick) is 0 for a large value of cstick. The above
lemma implies that, considering miners with small computa-
tional power, if a Nash equilibrium exists, only Ωstick would
remain as loyal miners to coinB in the equilibrium. This is
because (rF , rB) would continually change when rB is greater
than cstick. From Lemma V.1, we can characterize the set
E(c, cstick) as stated in Theorem V.2. We present the proof
of Lemma V.1 and Theorem V.2 in the full version of this
paper [31].

As described above, Theorem V.2 shows that, in a game
where players except for Ωstick possess small computational
there exist only Nash equilibria where the coinB-
power,
factions sticking to coinB-mining are loyal miners for coinB.
In the case where cstick is small, we can certainly see that
the overall health of the coinB system would be weakened in
terms of scalability, decentralization, and security, which will
be discussed in more detail in Section VII-A. Indeed, even
if cstick is large, the case where rB is equal to cstick would
make the coinB system signiﬁcantly centralized because only
a few players possessing large power are loyal miners to coinB
(this example is presented in Section VII-B). In particular, if
Ωstick is empty, no miner exists in the coinB system in all
Nash equilibria. Remark that this case indicates the complete
downfall of coinB. As a result, Theorem V.2 implies that ﬁckle
mining can be dangerous.

Section VII) due to a large degree of freedom in c. Thus, we
further assume that players except for Ωstick (i.e., Ω\Ωstick)
possess inﬁnitesimal computational power (i.e., (cid:7)c(cid:7)2 ≈ 0).
We show that this assumption is reasonable by analyzing the
real-world dataset in the Bitcoin system (see Section VI). We
again study the equilibria of G(c, cstick) in this case.

We present the proof of Theorem V.3 in the full version
of this paper [31]. Comparing with Theorem V.2, the state
(0, k
k+1 ) also becomes another Nash equilibrium when the
computational power possessed by players (except for Ωstick)
is inﬁnitesimal. Note that this state indicates the stable coex-
istence of coinA and coinB. Indeed, when (cid:7)c(cid:7)2 is closer to
0, the difference among payoffs of players in MF , MA, and
MB would also be closer to 0 at the state (0, k
k+1 ). Therefore,
under the assumption that players possess inﬁnitesimal power,
payoffs of players in MF , MA, and MB are the same at the
state (0, k
k+1 ) while the mining difﬁculties of coinA and coinB
k
are maintained as
k+1, respectively. Meanwhile, at
the remaining equilibria except for the state (0, k
k+1 ), only the
coinB-factions Ωstick conduct coinB-mining after the coinB-
mining difﬁculty increases. In particular, if no coinB-faction
