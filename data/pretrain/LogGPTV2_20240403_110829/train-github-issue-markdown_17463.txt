Could you please provide official chart for your image.
The stable/airflow chart was created for image puckel/docker-airflow.
There are specific features in the puckel/docker-airflow entrypoint you don't
have
such as  
https://github.com/puckel/docker-airflow/blob/master/script/entrypoint.sh#L13  
https://github.com/puckel/docker-airflow/blob/master/script/entrypoint.sh#L57
So your image won't work with stable/airflow correctly
