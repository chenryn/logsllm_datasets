User: I installed Python 3.4.3 and then installed Python 2.7.9 on Mac Air. If I run Python on a command line, it shows Python 2.7.9. I removed Python 2.7.9, it still shows Python 2.7.9. What is the problem? Thanks.
Assistant: Probably the links are not working
To solve this, backup your current python link:
cp /usr/bin/python ~/Desktop
Remove the old soft link and create a new soft link pointing to Python 3.4.3 installation:
rm -f /usr/bin/python
ln -s /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.4/bin/python3.4 /usr/bin/python
