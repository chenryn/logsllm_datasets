User: I generally use Python 2.7 but recently installed Python 3.5 using Miniconda on Mac OS X. Different libraries have been installed for these two versions of python. Now, the entering either of the keywords 'python' or 'python3' in terminal invokes python 3.5, and 'python2' returns '-bash: python2: command not found'. How can I now invoke them specifically using aliases 'python2' and 'python3' respectively?
I am currently using OS X El Capitan.
Assistant: OSX's Python binary (version 2) is located at /usr/bin/python
if you use which python it will tell you where the python command is being resolved to. Typically, what happens is third parties redefine things in /usr/local/bin (which takes precedence, by default over /usr/bin). To fix, you can either run /usr/bin/python directly to use 2.x or find the errant redefinition (probably in /usr/local/bin or somewhere else in your PATH)
