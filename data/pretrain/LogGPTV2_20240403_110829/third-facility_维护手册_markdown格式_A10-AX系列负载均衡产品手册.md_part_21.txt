**A10 Thunder Series and AX Seriesâ€”Command Line Interface Reference**

### SYN Cookies
SYN cookies can be confusing to clients because they expect only one SYN-ACK in response to their SYN.

#### Example
The following command enables hardware-based SYN cookies:
```plaintext
ACOS(config)#syn-cookie enable
```

The following command configures dynamic SYN cookies when the number of concurrent half-open TCP connections exceeds 50,000, and disables them when the number falls below 30,000:
```plaintext
ACOS(config)#syn-cookie enable on-threshold 50000 off-threshold 30000
```

### System All-VLAN Limit
Set the global traffic limits for all VLANs. The limit applies system-wide, and collectively, all ACOS device VLANs cannot exceed the specified limit.

To configure the limit per individual VLAN, use `system per-vlan-limit` (see page 199).

#### Syntax
```plaintext
[no] system all-vlan-limit {bcast | ipmcast | mcast | unknown-ucast} num
```

#### Parameters
- **all-vlan-limit**: Applies system-wide to all VLANs.
- **per-vlan-limit**: Applies to each VLAN individually.
- **bcast**: Limits broadcast traffic.
- **ipmcast**: Limits IP multicast traffic.
- **mcast**: Limits all multicast packets except for IP multicast packets.
- **unknown-ucast**: Limits all unknown unicast traffic.
- **num**: Specifies the maximum number of packets per second allowed for the specified traffic type.

#### Default
5000 packets per second.

#### Mode
Configuration mode

#### Example
The following command limits each VLAN to 1000 multicast packets per second:
```plaintext
ACOS(config)#system per-vlan-limit mcast 1000
```

### System Anomaly Log
Enable logging for packet anomaly events, which applies to system-wide attacks such as SYN attacks.

#### Syntax
```plaintext
[no] system anomaly log
```

#### Default
Disabled

#### Mode
Configuration mode

### System Attack Log
Enable logging for DDoS attacks.

#### Syntax
```plaintext
[no] system attack log
```

#### Default
Disabled

#### Mode
Configuration mode

### System CPU Load Sharing
The CPU Round Robin feature mitigates the effects of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks targeting a single CPU on the ACOS device. This command configures thresholds for CPU load sharing. If a threshold is exceeded, CPU load sharing is activated, and additional CPUs are enlisted to help process traffic and relieve the burden on the targeted CPU. A round robin algorithm distributes packets across all other data CPUs on the device. Load sharing remains in effect until traffic no longer exceeds the thresholds that originally activated the feature.

#### Syntax
```plaintext
[no] system cpu-load-sharing
{
cpu-usage low percent |
cpu-usage high percent |
disable |
packets-per-second min num-pkts
}
```

#### Parameters
- **cpu-usage low percent**: Lower CPU utilization threshold. Once the data CPU utilization rate drops below this threshold, CPU round robin redistribution stops. Default is 60%.
- **cpu-usage high percent**: Upper CPU utilization threshold. Once the data CPU utilization rate exceeds this threshold, CPU round robin redistribution begins. Default is 75%.
- **disable**: Disables CPU load sharing.
- **packets-per-second min num-pkts**: Maximum number of packets per second any CPU can receive before CPU load sharing is used. You can specify 0-30 million packets per second.

#### Default
- **cpu-usage low**: 60%
- **cpu-usage high**: 75%
- **packets-per-second**: 100,000

#### Mode
Configuration mode

#### Usage
If a hacker targets the ACOS device by repeatedly flooding it with many packets that have the same source and destination ports, this could overwhelm the CPU being targeted. The CPU load sharing feature (enabled by default) protects the device by using a round robin algorithm to distribute the load across multiple CPUs when an attack is detected.

ACOS will activate round robin distribution across multiple CPUs if all of the following conditions occur:
1. The utilization rate of the CPU being targeted exceeds the configured high threshold (default is 75%).
2. The CPU being targeted is receiving traffic at a rate that exceeds the minimum configured threshold (default is 100,000 packets per second).
3. The CPU being targeted is receiving significantly more traffic than the other CPUs on the ACOS device. Specifically, the CPU being targeted must have an elevated utilization rate that is at least 50% higher than the median utilization rate of its peer CPUs.

ACOS will deactivate CPU round robin mode and return to normal mode when the first criterion, and either the second or third condition, are no longer true.

For example, CPU round robin mode will cease if:
1. The targeted CPU utilization rate drops below the low threshold (default is 60%), and
   - The targeted CPU is receiving packets at a rate below the minimum configured packets-per-second threshold, or
   - The utilization rate of the targeted CPU is no longer 50% higher than the median of its neighboring CPUs.

### System DDoS Attack
Enable logging for DDoS attack events.

#### Syntax
```plaintext
[no] system ddos-attack log
```

#### Mode
Configuration mode

### System GLID
Apply a combined set of IP limiting rules to the whole system.

#### Syntax
```plaintext
[no] system glid num
```

Replace `num` with the global LID you want to use.

#### Default
None

#### Mode
Configuration mode

#### Usage
This command uses a single global LID. To configure the global LID, see "glid" on page 123.

#### Example

- **crypto-mem percentage**: Percentage of memory that can be assigned for IPsec processing.

#### Default
N/A

#### Mode
Configuration mode

### System Log CPU Interval
Log occurrences where the CPU is at a high usage for a specified duration.

#### Syntax
```plaintext

- **medium**: Throttles CLI and SNMP output when control CPU utilization reaches 25%.
- **high**: Throttles CLI and SNMP output when control CPU utilization reaches 45%. This is the least aggressive setting.

#### Default
Not set. Throttling does not occur.

#### Mode
Configuration mode

#### Usage
The command takes effect only for new CLI sessions that are started after you enter the command. After entering the command, close currently open CLI sessions and start a new one.

### System Per-VLAN Limit
Configure the packet flooding limit per VLAN. The limit applies to each VLAN, and no individual can exceed the specified limit.

To configure a global limit for all VLANs, use `system all-vlan-limit` (see page 195).

#### Syntax
```plaintext
[no] system per-vlan-limit {bcast | ipmcast | mcast | unknown-ucast} limit
```

#### Parameters
- **bcast**: Configure the limit for broadcast packets.
- **ipmcast**: Configure the limit for IP multicast packets.
- **mcast**: Configure the limit for multicast packets.
- **unknown-ucast**: Configure the limit for unknown unicast packets.
- **limit**: Configure the number of packets per second (1-65535).

#### Default
1000 packets per second.

#### Mode
Configuration mode

#### Example
The following example sets the packet limit to 5000 broadcast packets per second:
```plaintext
AOCS(config)#system per-vlan-limit bcast 5000
```

### System Promiscuous Mode
Enable the system to pass traffic in promiscuous mode. This setting enables an interface to pass all received traffic directly to the CPU, instead of passing only the packets intended for that interface. Promiscuous mode is commonly used as a tool to help diagnose network connectivity problems.

#### Syntax
```plaintext
[no] system promiscuous-mode
```

#### Default
Not enabled.

#### Mode
Configuration mode

### System Resource Usage
Change the capacity of a system resource.

#### Syntax
```plaintext
[no] system resource-usage resource-type
```

#### Command Description
- **resource-type**: Specifies the resource type and the maximum allowed:
  - **auth-portal-html-file-size num**: Maximum file size allowed for AAM HTML files (4-120 Kbytes).
  - **auth-portal-image-file-size num**: Maximum file size allowed for AAM portal image files (1-80 Kbytes).
  - **class-list-ac-entry-count**: Maximum SNI entries allowed per ACOS device for Aho-Corasik class-lists (when used for SSL Insight bypass).
  - **class-list-ipv6-addr-count**: Maximum number of IPv6 addresses allowed within each IPv6 class list (524288-1048576).
  - **l4-session-count num**: Maximum number of Layer 4 sessions supported (32768-524288).
  - **max-aflex-file-size num**: Maximum size of an aFleX script in Kbytes (16-256). The default maximum allowable file size is 32K.

#### Mode
Configuration mode

#### Usage
- To place a change to `l4-session-count` into effect, a reboot is required. A reload will not place this change into effect.
- For changes to any of the other system resources, a reload is required but a reboot is not required.

### System Template
Globally applies a template to the ACOS device.

#### Syntax
```plaintext
[no] system template template-type template-name
```

#### Default
N/A

#### Mode
Configuration mode

#### Usage
This command applies only to certain template types. For each valid option, a section in the configuration guide describes its use.

### System VE MAC Scheme
Configure MAC address assignment for Virtual Ethernet (VE) interfaces.

#### Syntax
```plaintext
[no] system ve-mac-scheme {round-robin | system-mac | hash-based}
```

#### Parameters
- **round-robin**: In the shared partition, assigns MAC addresses in round-robin fashion, starting with the address for port 1. Each new VE, regardless of the VE number, is assigned the MAC address of the next Ethernet data port. This option is not supported in L3V partitions.
- **system-mac**: In the shared partition, assigns the system MAC address (the MAC address of Ethernet data port 1) to all VEs. In an L3V partition, allocates a system MAC for the partition and assigns the system MAC address of the partition to all VLANs and VEs in the partition. This is useful when configuring cross connect between partitions.
- **hash-based**: In the shared partition, uses a hash value based on the VE number to select an Ethernet data port and assigns that data portâ€™s MAC address to the VE. This method always assigns the same Ethernet data portâ€™s MAC address to a given VE number, on any model, regardless of the order in which VEs are configured. This option is not supported in L3V partitions.

#### Default
hash-based

#### Mode
Configuration mode

#### Usage
This command can be configured only in the shared partition, not in L3V partitions. A reload or reboot is required to place the change into effect.

#### Example
Below is an example of the `system-mac` parameter and how it is used with L3V partitions. First, assume we have partitions "p1" and "p2" on the device, then execute the command:
```plaintext
ACOS(config)#system ve-mac-scheme system-mac
```

After rebooting or reloading the device, examine the MAC addresses to see the mac-scheme applied on the VEs.

First, in partition "p1":
```plaintext
ACOS[p1](config)#show interfaces brief | sec ve600
ve600 Down N/A N/A N/A 600 021f.a008.01f7 0.0.0.0/0 0
ACOS[p1](config)#
```

Next, in partition "p2":
```plaintext
ACOS[p2]#show interfaces brief | sec ve800
ve800 Down N/A N/A N/A 800 021f.a008.02f7 0.0.0.0/0 0
ACOS[p2]#
```

Finally, in the shared partition:
```plaintext
ACOS(config)#show interfaces brief | sec ve
ve500 Down N/A N/A N/A 500 021f.a008.00f7 51.51.51.2/24 1
ACOS(config)#
```

The MAC address for each partition is unique to the partition.

### System Jumbo Global Enable Jumbo
Globally enable jumbo frame support. In this release, a jumbo frame is an Ethernet frame that is more than 1522 bytes long.

**Note**: Jumbo frames are not supported on all platforms. For detailed information, refer to the Release Notes.

#### Syntax
```plaintext
[no] system-jumbo-global enable-jumbo
```

**Note**: This is the only command required to enable jumbo support on FTA models. See the Usage section below for details on enabling jumbo support on non-FTA models.

#### Default
Disabled

#### Mode
Configuration mode

#### Usage
- If your configuration uses VEs, you must enable jumbo on the individual Ethernet ports first, then enable it on the VEs that use the ports. If the VE uses more than one port, the MTU on the VE should be the same or smaller than the MTU on each port.
- Enabling jumbo support does not automatically change the MTU on any interfaces. You must explicitly increase the MTU on those interfaces you plan to use for jumbo packets.
- Jumbo support is not recommended on 10/100 Mbps ports.
- On FTA models only, for any incoming jumbo frame, if the outgoing MTU is less than the incoming frame size, the ACOS device fragments the frame into 1500-byte fragments, regardless of the MTU set on the outbound interface. If it is less than 1500 bytes, it will be fragmented into the configured MTU.
- Setting the MTU on an interface indirectly sets the frame size of incoming packets to the same value (this is the maximum receive unit [MRU]).
- In previous releases, the default MTU is 1500 and cannot be set to a higher value.

**Caution**: On non-FTA models, after you enable (or disable) jumbo frame support, you must save the configuration (`write memory` command) and reboot (`reboot` command) to place the change into effect. If jumbo support is enabled on a non-FTA model and you erase the startup-config, the device is rebooted after the configuration is erased.

### System Reset
Restore the ACOS device to its factory default settings.

#### What is Erased
- Saved configuration files
- System files, such as SSL certificates and keys, aFleX policies, black/white lists, and system logs

#### What is Preserved
- Running configuration
- Management IP address
- Admin-configured admins
- Enable password
- Imported files
- Inactive partitions

#### Syntax
```plaintext
system-reset
```

#### Default
N/A

#### Mode
Configuration mode

#### Usage
This command is helpful when you need to redeploy an ACOS device in a new environment or at a new customer site, or you need to start over the configuration at the same site. The command does not automatically reboot or power down the device. The device continues to operate using the running-config and any other system files in memory until you reboot or power down the device.

Reboot the ACOS device to erase the running-config and place the system reset into effect.

#### Example
The following commands reset an ACOS device to its factory default configuration, then reboot the device to erase the running-config:
```plaintext
ACOS(config)#system-reset
ACOS(config)#end
ACOS#reboot
```

### TACACS+ Server Host
Configure TACACS+ for authorization and accounting. If authorization or accounting is specified, the ACOS device will attempt to use the TACACS+ servers in the order they are configured. If one server fails to respond, the next server will be used.

#### Syntax
```plaintext
[no] tacacs-server host {hostname | ipaddr} secret secret-string [port portnum] [timeout seconds]
```

#### Parameters
- **hostname**: Host name of the TACACS+ server. If a host name is used, make sure a DNS server has been configured.
- **ipaddr**: IP address of the TACACS+ server.
- **secret-string**: Password, 1-128 characters, required by the TACACS+ server for authentication requests.
- **portnum**: The port used for setting up a connection with a TACACS+ server. The default port is 49.
- **seconds**: The maximum number of seconds allowed for setting up a connection with a TACACS+ server. You can specify 1-12 seconds. The default timeout is 12 seconds.

#### Default
See descriptions.

#### Mode
Configuration mode
