client expects only one SYN-ACK in reply to the client’s SYN.
Example The following command enables hardware-based SYN cookies:
ACOS(config)#syn-cookie enable
The command in the following example configures dynamic SYN cookies when the number
of concurrent half-open TCP connections exceeds 50000, and disables SYN cookies when
the number falls below 30000:
ACOS(config)#syn-cookie enable on-threshold 50000 off-threshold

system cpu-load-sharing
Description The CPU Round Robin feature can be used to mitigate the effects of Denial of Service (DoS)
attacks that target a single CPU on the ACOS device. You can use this command to configure
thresholds for CPU load sharing. If a threshold is exceeded, CPU load sharing is activated, and
additional CPUs are enlisted to help process traffic and relieve the burden on the targeted
CPU. A round robin algorithm distributes packets across all of the other data CPUs on the
device. Load sharing will remain in effect until traffic is no longer exceeding the thresholds
that originally activated the feature. (See the “Usage” section below for details.)
Syntax [no] system cpu-load-sharing
{
cpu-usage low percent |
cpu-usage high percent |
disable |
packets-per-second min num-pkts
}
Parameter Description
cpu-usage low Lower CPU utilization threshold. Once the data CPU utilization rate drops below this thresh-
percent old, then CPU round robin redistribution will stop. The default is 60, but you can specify 0-
100 percent.
cpu-usage high Upper CPU utilization threshold. Once the data CPU utilization rate exceeds this threshold,
percent then CPU round robin redistribution will begin. The default is 75, but you can specify 0-100
percent.
Document No.: 410-P2-CLI-001 - 6/17/2016 | page 196
A10 Thunder Series and AX Series—Command Line Interface Reference
Parameter Description
disable Disables CPU load sharing. The CPU round robin feature is not used, even if a triggering
threshold is breached.
packets-per-second Maximum number of packets per second any CPU can receive, before CPU load sharing is
min num-pkts used. You can specify 0-30000000 (30 million) packets per second.
Default The CPU load sharing feature is enabled. The thresholds have the following default values:
• cpu-usage low – 60 percent
• cpu-usage high – 75 percent
• packets-per-second – 100000
Mode Configuration mode
Usage If a hacker targets the ACOS device by repeatedly flooding the device with many packets
that have the same source and destination ports, this could overwhelm the CPU that is being
targeted. However, the CPU load sharing feature (which is enabled by default) protects the
device by using a round robin algorithm to distribute the load across multiple CPUs when
such an attack is detected.
ACOS will activate this round robin distribution across multiple CPUs if all of the following
conditions occur:
1.If the utilization rate of the CPU being targeted exceeds the configured high threshold
(which has a default value of 75%), AND
2.If the CPU being targeted is receiving traffic at a rate that exceeds the minimum config-
ured threshold (the default is 100,000 packets per second), AND
3.If the CPU being targeted is receiving significantly more traffic than the other CPUs on
the ACOS device. If all CPUs are under a heavy load, there would be no advantage to
using round robin to distribute the traffic. Therefore, the CPU being targeted must have
an elevated utilization rate that is at least 50% higher than the median utilization rate of
its peer CPUs. (For example, this criterion would be met if the non-targeted CPUs have a
median packet flow of 100,000 packets per second, but the targeted CPU is receiving
packets at a rate exceeding 150,00 packets per second, in which case it would be 50%
higher than the median of the rate of the other processors).
ACOS will de-activate CPU round robin mode and return to normal mode when the first
criterion, and either 2 or 3 above are no longer true.
For example, CPU round robin mode will cease:
1.If the targeted CPU utilization rate drops below the low threshold (default is 60%), AND
• If the targeted CPU is receiving packets at a rate below the minimum configured
packets-per-second threshold, OR
• If the utilization rate of the targeted CPU is no longer 50% higher than the median
of its neighboring CPUs.

system ve-mac-scheme
Description Configure MAC address assignment for Virtual Ethernet (VE) interfaces.
Syntax [no] system ve-mac-scheme {round-robin | system-mac | hash-based}
Parameter Description
round-robin In the shared partition, this option assigns MAC addresses in round-robin fashion, beginning with the
address for port 1. Each new VE, regardless of the VE number, is assigned the MAC address of the next
Ethernet data port. For example:
• The MAC address of Ethernet data port 1 is assigned to the first VE you configure.
• The MAC address of Ethernet data port 2 is assigned to the second VE you configure.
• The MAC address of Ethernet data port 3 is assigned to the third VE you configure.
This process continues until the MAC address of the highest-numbered Ethernet data port on the
ACOS device is assigned to a VE. After the last Ethernet data port’s MAC address is assigned to a VE,
MAC assignment begins again with Ethernet data port 1. The number of physical Ethernet data ports
on the ACOS device differs depending on the ACOS model.
This option is not supported in L3V partitions.
system-mac In the shared partition, this option assigns the system MAC address (the MAC address of Ethernet data
port 1) to all VEs.
In an L3V partition, this option allocates a system MAC for the partition and assigns the system MAC
address of the partition to all VLANs and VEs in the partition. This is useful when configuring cross con-
nect between partitions.
hash-based In the shared partition, this option causes ACOS to use a hash value based on the VE number to select
an Ethernet data port, and assigns that data port’s MAC address to the VE. This method always assigns
the same Ethernet data port’s MAC address to a given VE number, on any model, regardless of the
order in which VEs are configured.
This option is not supported in L3V partitions.
Default hash-based
Mode Configuration mode
Usage This command can be configured only in the shared partition, not in L3V partitions. A
reload or reboot is required to place the change into effect.
Example Below is an example of the system-mac parameter and how it is used with L3V partitions.
First, assume we have partitions “p1” and “P2” on the device, then execute the command:
ACOS(config)#system ve-mac-scheme system-mac
After rebooting or reloading the device, examine the MAC addresses to see the mac-scheme
applied on the VEs.
First, in partition “p1”:
ACOS[p1](config)#show interfaces brief | sec ve600
Document No.: 410-P2-CLI-001 - 6/17/2016 | page 202
A10 Thunder Series and AX Series—Command Line Interface Reference
ve600 Down N/A N/A N/A 600 021f.a008.01f7 0.0.0.0/0 0
ACOS[p1](config)#
Next, in partition “p2”:
ACOS[p2]#show interfaces brief | sec ve800
ve800 Down N/A N/A N/A 800 021f.a008.02f7 0.0.0.0/0 0
ACOS[p2]#
Finally, in the shared partition:
ACOS(config)#show interfaces brief | sec ve
ve500 Down N/A N/A N/A 500 021f.a008.00f7 51.51.51.2/24 1

The MAC address for each partition is unique to the partition.
system-jumbo-global enable-jumbo
Description Globally enable jumbo frame support. In this release, a jumbo frame is an Ethernet frame
that is more than 1522 bytes long.
NOTE: Jumbo frames are not supported on all platforms. For detailed information, refer to
the Release Notes.
Syntax [no] system-jumbo-global enable-jumbo
NOTE: This is the only command required to enable jumbo support on FTA models. See
the Usage section below for details on enabling jumbo support on non-FTA mod-
els.
Default Disabled
Mode Configuration mode
Usage Notes about the usage of this command:
• If your configuration uses VEs, you must enable jumbo on the individual Ethernet ports
first, then enable it on the VEs that use the ports. If the VE uses more than port, the MTU
on the VE should be the same or smaller than the MTU on each port.
• Enabling jumbo support does not automatically change the MTU on any interfaces.
You must explicitly increase the MTU on those interfaces you plan to use for jumbo
packets.
• Jumbo support is not recommended on 10/100 Mbps ports.
• On FTA models only, for any incoming jumbo frame, if the outgoing MTU is less than
the incoming frame size, the ACOS device fragments the frame into 1500-byte frag-
page 203 | Document No.: 410-P2-CLI-001 - 6/17/2016
A10 Thunder Series and AX Series—Command Line Interface Reference
ments, regardless of the MTU set on the outbound interface. If it is less than 1500 bytes,
it will be fragmented into the configured MTU.
• Setting the MTU on an interface indirectly sets the frame size of incoming packets to
the same value. (This is the maximum receive unit [MRU]).
• In previous releases, the default MTU is 1500 and can not be set to a higher value.
CAUTION: On non-FTA models, after you enable (or disable) jumbo frame support, you must
save the configuration (write memory command) and reboot (reboot com-
mand) to place the change into effect.
If jumbo support is enabled on a non-FTA model and you erase the startup-config, the
device is rebooted after the configuration is erased.Configuration mode.
system-reset
Description Restore the ACOS device to its factory default settings.
The following table summarizes that is removed or preserved on the system:

Mode Configuration mode
Usage This command is helpful when you need to redeploy an ACOS device in a new environment
or at a new customer site, or you need to start over the configuration at the same site.
The command does not automatically reboot or power down the device. The device
continues to operate using the running-config and any other system files in memory, until
you reboot or power down the device.
