I've just changed a component from `class Header extends React.Component` to
`const Header = (props) => (/*JSX here*/ )`.
Now one of my tests is failing because it can't find an instance of that
component where there should be one. This line of code:
    import Header from '../../header';
    //...
    let header = TestUtils.findRenderedComponentWithType(myRenderedPage, Header);
    //I then need to simulate a click on a button that's inside the header component.
Gives this error:
    Error: Did not find exactly one match for componentType:function Header(props) {
          return _react2['default'].createElement(
            //component implementation here
          );
        } (found 0)
I'm _guessing_ it's because the function that I'm importing in my test file
(i.e. `Header`) is not the same one that was used to create the component in
my actual code, because each place that imports a function gets its own
instance of it. Which means that the types never match according to TestUtils.
And before it must have worked because ES6 classes are unique somehow, so you
always import the same thing?
Is this expected behaviour when using functional components, or is there
something I'm missing?
