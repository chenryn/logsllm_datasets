User: I have python 2.6.6 and python 3.1.3 currently installed on my machine (Windows Vista 64 bit)
My path variable includes the directory of both versions. How can I specify which python I want to run a program in. For instance, if I want to run a program in python 3, it works but if I want to run a different program in python2 I get a syntax error. So how can I run a python 2 program in the cmd?
Typing python in my command line, python 3.1.3 is the only one that shows up.
Assistant: Instead of just typing "python" on the command line, use the full path the python.exe that you want to run: FULL_PATH_TO_PYTHON_2.6.6\python.exe or FULL_PATH_TO_PYTHON_3.1.3\python.exe should distinguish between the two.
