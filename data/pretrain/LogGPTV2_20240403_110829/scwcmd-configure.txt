**Applies to:**

- Windows Server 2012 R2
- Windows Server 2012

**Description:**
The `scwcmd configure` command applies a Security Configuration Wizard (SCW)-generated security policy to a computer. This command-line tool can also accept a list of computer names as input.

**Syntax:**
```shell
scwcmd configure [[[/m: | /ou:] /p:] | /i:] [/u:] [/pw:] [/t:] [/l] [/e]
```

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `/m:` | Specifies the NetBIOS name, DNS name, or IP address of the computer to configure. If this parameter is used, the `/p` parameter must also be specified. |
| `/ou:` | Specifies the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of an organizational unit (OU) in Active Directory Domain Services. If this parameter is used, the `/p` parameter must also be specified. All computers in the OU will be configured against the given policy. |
| `/p:` | Specifies the path and file name of the .xml policy file to be used for the configuration. |
| `/i:` | Specifies the path and file name of an .xml file that contains a list of computers along with their expected policy files. All computers in the .xml file will be analyzed against their corresponding policy files. A sample .xml file is located at `%windir%\security\SampleMachineList.xml`. |
| `/u:` | Specifies an alternate user credential to use when performing the configuration on a remote computer. The default is the logged-on user. |
| `/pw:` | Specifies an alternate password to use when performing the configuration on a remote computer. The default is the password of the logged-on user. |
| `/t:` | Specifies the number of simultaneous outstanding configuration operations that should be maintained during the analysis. The value range is 1-1000, with a default value of 40. |
| `/l` | Causes the analysis process to be logged. One log file will be generated for each computer being analyzed. The log files will be stored in the same directory as the result files. Use the `/o` option to specify the directory for the result files. |
| `/e` | Logs an event to the Application Event log if a mismatch is found. |
| `/?` | Displays help at the command prompt. |

**Examples:**

1. **Configure a security policy against the file `webpolicy.xml`:**
   ```shell
   scwcmd configure /p:webpolicy.xml
   ```

2. **Configure a security policy for the computer at `172.16.0.0` against the file `webpolicy.xml` using the credentials of the `webadmin` account:**
   ```shell
   scwcmd configure /m:172.16.0.0 /p:webpolicy.xml /u:webadmin /pw:password
   ```

3. **Configure a security policy on all computers listed in `campusmachines.xml` with a maximum of 100 threads:**
   ```shell
   scwcmd configure /i:campusmachines.xml /t:100
   ```

4. **Configure a security policy for the `WebServers` OU against the file `webpolicy.xml` using the `DomainAdmin` credentials:**
   ```shell
   scwcmd configure /ou:OU=WebServers,DC=Marketing,DC=ABCCompany,DC=com /p:webpolicy.xml /u:DomainAdmin /pw:password
   ```

**Note:**
- Ensure that the paths to the policy files and the list of computers are correct.
- When using the `/u` and `/pw` parameters, provide valid credentials to avoid authentication issues.
