User: I want the program to wait like 5 seconds before exiting the console after finishing whatever it does, so the user can read the "Good Bye" message, how can one do this?
Assistant: If it's not a multithreaded program, then just let the program do whatever it needs and then: raw_input("Press Enter to stop the sharade.\n")

Maybe it's not exactly what you're looking for but on the other hand you should not rely on a predefined sleep time.
