of 2018 presented by IndustryARC [91] concludes that multimodal models
are practical and robust while it addresses their applicability in the next
generation biometric systems. Finally, according to the results from a recent
survey commissioned by VISA in 2018 [220], biometrics win the favor of users
and the day when biometric implementations completely substitute the other
traditional recognition technologies is drawing nearer.
Over the last years, the biometric veriﬁcation of a claimed identity in online
services is growing rapidly [15]. According to the study of Acuity 2018 [5], all
smartphone devices will have at least some kind of an embedded biometric
technology by 2019, while by 2020 the technology will be applicable to wearable
tech and tablets. Such expectations induce an enormous increase of the amount of
biometric data, requiring suﬃcient storage capacity and a signiﬁcant processing
power [163]. In the age of the Internet, the need for highly accessible, scalable
INTRODUCTION

and secure biometric deployments leads to the move of the existing biometric
technology to the cloud [15]. This is mainly due to the cloud computing promising
beneﬁts of unbounded resources, parallel processing capabilities, better ﬂexibility
and cost reduction [11]. In addition to the widespread use of mobile devices,
the cloud provides an accessible entry point for various services for mobile
consumers [202]. Thus, the remote computation environment in the cloud is
capable of addressing operational issues on large-scale datasets originated from
various platforms and handling eﬃciently the challenges related to the next
generation of biometrics [99]. Finally, it enables advanced applications including
smart spaces, access control schemes, ePayment architectures and ambient
intelligence systems, among others.
Furthermore, Acuity [5] estimates that biometric data will be outsourced to
the cloud and more than 5.5 billion biometrically-enabled devices will create a
global platform by 2022. It is expected that the cloud computing services will
become even easier to use and service providers will be capable of authenticating
more than one trillion transactions annually while the market volume will rise
rapidly. A governance cloud-based Biometrics-as-a-Service (BaaS) framework
leverages the cloud computing infrastructure, allowing for component developers
to outsource custom tools for biometric recognition to the cloud [11]. Similarly
to the Single Sign-On designs, BaaS oﬀers identity management services via
cloud-based Identity-Management-as-a-Service (IdMaaS) providers. Acuity [5]
predicts that during the next years, many services will rely heavily on IdMaaS
vendors that develop and outsource biometric extraction methods and matching
algorithms for multiple biometric modalities, allowing for convenient and secure
user authentication. Therefore, Authentication-as-a-Service (AaaS) is being
studied as a new cloud service model that provides ubiquitous network access
for performing on-demand authentication processes [202]. Although biometric
local processing is usually seen as more convenient for the privacy of the users,
there are numerous use cases, including these of the government and ﬁnancial
sectors, which can be beneﬁt from the existing biometric datasets. For these
scenarios motivated by law enforcement (e.g., ﬁghting identity fraud and money
laundering), the access and usage of large-scale information in the cloud are
essential.
However, the protection of user’s data remains the biggest challenge for
the migration of biometrics to the cloud, preventing service providers and
organizations from trusting the cloud and taking advantage of its computing
resources [11]. Biometric data are sensitive personal information by nature
and their storage, transmission and processing across third parties could result
in compromise [96, 99]. Thus, the European Regulatory Technical Standards
for Strong Customer Authentication [183], following the European General
Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) [66] deﬁne the privacy principles and
112
SECURE AND PRIVACY-FRIENDLY MULTIMODAL BIOMETRIC AUTHENTICATION USING
CLOUD-BASED IDENTITY PROVIDERS
the security requirements for cloud schemes that support diﬀerent security
objectives for the storage of biometrics. The regulatory compliance requires the
incorporation of cryptographic techniques for the security of biometrics in order
to address the threats to the privacy of the user when his data are stored in a
Centralized Biometric Database (CBDB). Additionally, cloud providers that
perform IdMaaS and AaaS tasks must use encryption schemes to protect data
and must oﬀer to the users the control over their own data in accordance with
the security recommendations of the legal framework [27]. Traditional encryption
does not allow processing of encrypted data and therefore it cannot preserve the
privacy of biometric information processed in the cloud. Current secure cloud
storage schemes rely on diﬀerent cryptographic primitives, such as homomorphic
encryption and template protection mechanisms as privacy-friendly approaches
in an environment with untrusted parties [109]. Nevertheless, users’ proﬁles
including information such as access patterns and cloud connections may still
remain available to the parties involved in the computation, thus disclosing
information that aﬀects the users’ rights to privacy [39]. The rise of BaaS
schemes in a variety of applications has led to the necessity for more secure
practices, taking into account data leakage and attacks [202].
Currently used commercial BaaS oﬀers unimodal biometric AaaS as described
by IndustryARC [91]. Figure 1 illustrates a typical architecture. 1) The user
requests the registration to a service. The service provider (SP) authenticates
the user based on biometric data. However, it does not have the authorization or
expertise to process the biometric features. For that reason, the SP redirects the
user to the cloud-based BaaS third-party provider that performs the biometric
authentication. 2) During the enrollment phase, through the use of a mobile-
enabled web application of the SP and the embedded camera on his smartphone,
the user provides identity credentials and presents his facial biometric to the
cloud computing infrastructure. The interface involves a unimodal IdMaaS
provider that establishes the list of user identities while it manages authorization
and maintains user permissions. Additionally, this provider is in charge of
extracting the biometric features and securely storing the biometric data while
it outsources the algorithms for the template generation which includes the
binary representation of the extracted samples. Hence, it can oﬀer AaaS services.
It is noted that the IdMaaS developers may follow and outsource diﬀerent
methods to determine a matching result. 3) The third stage of the enrollment
involves the secure transmission of the user’s biometric information that are
placed in the encrypted DB of the IdMaaS which includes the stored templates
of the enrolled users. 4) During the authentication process, the user who wants
to login to the service, is redirected by the SP to the IdMaaS. 5) The user
presents his fresh biometrics. 6) In the computing infrastructure through the
tools of the IdMaaS provider, the biometric data are securely extracted and the
new template is created. 7) During the matching operation or module, which is
INTRODUCTION
113
the term used in the area of pattern recognition [122], the new and the stored
templates are securely transmitted and compared. 8) The decision module
involves the comparison of the matching score with a predeﬁned threshold. 9)
The SP communicates the result of this ﬁnal module that determines the access
of the user.
Figure 1: Unimodal biometric recognition as a cloud-based service.
Biometrics in cloud-based services and user authentication using remote IdMaaS
providers have an enormous market potential and present important research
challenges [5, 11, 15]. However, the available literature on multimodalities in
BaaS is still scarce. Motivated by biometric recognition services adopting cloud
computing, we introduce a less invasive, secure and privacy-preserving system
for multimodal biometric authentication in the cloud. Similar to the previous
example, the SP that requires the biometric authentication of the user redirects
him to a cloud-based multimodal AaaS computation environment. The purpose
of our approach is to reduce the privacy risks of an additional re-enrollment phase
such as the collection and access to more individual’s data and their possible
misuses. In this way, we avoid an auxiliary temporary or permanent storage of
user’s biometrics in a CBDB, in order to decrease any further inappropriate use
of personal information that can lead to users’ identity tracking and monitoring.
The main contributions of our work are:
• We introduce a protocol for biometric authentication that exploits prior
stored unimodal templates collected in distinct DBs by AaaS providers that
we call unimodal authenticators (UAs).
114
SECURE AND PRIVACY-FRIENDLY MULTIMODAL BIOMETRIC AUTHENTICATION USING
CLOUD-BASED IDENTITY PROVIDERS
• To obtain a multimodal result, the matching scores of the distinct unimodal
subsystems of the UAs are combined to determine a ﬁnal fusion score. We
use Hamming Distance matching algorithms and a user-speciﬁc weighted
score level fusion method for the integration of unimodal matching scores
into a ﬁnal fused score.
• Our distributed approach involves a multimodal identity provider (MIP)
that is responsible for the cooperation of the UAs and their communication
between the SP and consequently the user. The MIP performs the IdMaaS
tasks for the transmission of the user’s new templates to the UAs while
it receives the fused score, sets the system’s ﬁnal decision threshold and
communicates the authentication result to the SP.
• Taking into account the strict privacy concerns that may limit the design
and implementation we use Multi-Party Computation (MPC) techniques to
utilize the stored templates in a privacy-preserving decentralized manner
and to achieve secure multimodal fusion.
• Using a virtualized computation environment, no sensitive privately held
data are exposed to any untrusted third party involved in the computation.
The MIP and the UAs do not learn the freshly acquired biometric data,
the stored templates, the unimodal matching scores, the fusion score or any
derived information from them. There is no leakage of data towards the SP
except of the unique output for the acceptance or rejection of the user.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the related
work. Section 3 presents design preliminaries on multimodal authentication
and on the MPC techniques used for building the security protocol. Section 4
elaborates the proposed system, which is followed by a security and privacy
analysis in Section 5, and a performance evaluation in Section 6. Finally,
Section 7 outlines the potential advantages and limitations of our approach
while Section 8 concludes this paper and describes future work.
2 Related Work
During the last years, research has been focused on biometric authentication
schemes as a secure method to access cloud services [99]. There are several
studies, such as the works in [160,163] that address the advantages that cloud
can oﬀer to biometric schemes, while the work in [21] underlines the security and
privacy threats of this integration to an untrusted infrastructure. In the context
of unimodal user authentication, the authors of [134] proposed an iris recognition
system implemented in the cloud to speed up the matching process of biometric
traits. Similarly, Blanton and Aliasgari in [25] designed a secure framework
RELATED WORK

for outsourced computation for iris matching that can be implemented in a
cloud setting. Additional unimodal architectures include the model of Zhu et al.
in [231] performed a voice-based authentication using homomorphic encryption
to secure the matching phase in the cloud. The work of Xiang et al. in [225]
introduced a privacy-preserving protocol for face recognition with outsourced
computation. Moreover, Omri et al. in [155] proposed a cloud-based design for
handwriting recognition using classiﬁer algorithms to handle the degradation
of the recognition accuracy, while the authors in [230] presented a complete
analysis on the biometrics extraction, storage and matching for a cloud-based
mobile signature authentication.
Wang et al.
in [222] presented a remote privacy-preserving biometric
identiﬁcation based on ﬁngerprints placed in an outsourced domain. The protocol
is built on a prototype encryption model for distance-computation. However,
the authors of [162] showed that the security assumptions for the scheme of
Wang et al. were not realistic and failed to take into consideration possible
privacy issues created by the information collection and distribution over several
SPs. Based on these ﬁndings, the work in [84] showed a practical attack that
enrolls fake ﬁngerprint data and then manipulates them to recover the encrypted
identiﬁcation request. The authors also addressed the fact of the performance
degradation of the approach of Wang et al. while they suggested several solutions
for improvements. Zhu et al. in [232] focused on the encryption scheme that
provides an eﬃcient model for privacy-preserving unimodal identiﬁcation in
the cloud, while Talreja et al. in [202] designed a generic AaaS framework for
remote user-speciﬁc unimodal authentication, providing a selection on matching
algorithms to achieve an ecosystem that beneﬁts both SPs and users.
Furthermore, Sarier [187] introduced the ﬁrst protocol resistant to hill-climbing
attacks for multimodal biometric authentication in the cloud, working with
Euclidean Distance for the matching procedures on encrypted stored templates.
However, the recognition is performed on unimodal templates of ﬁngerprints or
stored multimodal biometrics, where data recollection and transmission may
violate the privacy regulations as described in [183]. In the context of the MPC
techniques for BaaS purposes, the authors of [88] proposed a unimodal matching
on ﬁngerprints using MPC to enhance privacy during the calculation stages of
authentication. Finally, Blanton and Saraph in [26] described a secure framework
for unimodal matching that can be applied in a cloud. The design avoids the
storage of biometrics and the usage of MPC helps to protect the results from
the untrusted parties.
Unlike the related works, our system oﬀers AaaS using distinct cloud-based
providers, without an additional enrollment phase and the presence of an
additional CBDB. It performs multimodal fusion on already stored unimodal
sets through Hamming Distance matching algorithms and MPC techniques,
116
SECURE AND PRIVACY-FRIENDLY MULTIMODAL BIOMETRIC AUTHENTICATION USING
CLOUD-BASED IDENTITY PROVIDERS
and thus it avoids the loss of recognition accuracy and functionality. There is
no storage of multimodal templates while the stored unimodal biometrics, the
matching scores and the fused result are unaccessible by the remote providers.
The studies presented in [208,209] described a new fusion model, an overview
of how MPC can be combined with biometrics and an attempt to focus on
the privacy violation concerns that may occur during the calculation phases of
recognition, from the interactions between untrusted parties. In this paper, we
use part of their insights and present an integrated secure system. Moreover, we
take into consideration the work of Bringer et al. in [36] on the impact of MPC
techniques on identiﬁcation schemes in terms of accuracy, security and privacy.
To the best of our knowledge, our work is the ﬁrst to present such conﬁguration
in a detailed fashion, providing an eﬃcient secure and privacy-preserving system
that follows a less invasive process for multimodal biometric AaaS and addresses
the recommendations of the new European GDPR [66].
3 Preliminaries
This section includes the concepts and terms for our system related to the
feature recognition, matching and fusion. Additionally, the assumptions and
requirements used in the design of our secure protocol are detailed.
3.1 Background on Multimodal Authentication
Unimodal Biometric Recognition
Biometrics are based on pattern recognition techniques applied to the statistically
unique parts of biometric modalities in order to allow recognition [99]. For the
use-case scenario of our multimodal AaaS system introduced in Section 4, we
selected face, ﬁngerprint and iris biometrics. These biometric features have
gained considerable attention leading to their broader acceptance and trust in
schemes that integrate these features; they are currently preferred over other
modalities, as indicated in [20]. Below, recent state-of-the-art approaches for
face, ﬁngerprint and iris recognition are summarily presented; their extensive
analysis is outside the scope of this paper. According to the ﬁndings that are
presented in [36,122,229] the technique of Hamming Distance for biometrics
recognition is widely used in current commercial deployments, presenting reliable
results in terms of accuracy. For that reason, our system performs the matching
process of unimodal sets based on Hamming Distance algorithms. It is noted
that the authentication protocol can be adapted to support diﬀerent (or even
PRELIMINARIES
117
more than three) biometrics and recognition methods that can be calculated
over an arithmetic or Boolean circuit, as presented in [25,26].
Face Recognition Euclidean Distance and facial texture features are the
newest techniques in the ﬁeld of face recognition that can oﬀer an improved
accuracy in face recognition. In the literature, there are several approaches
that take advantage of statistical facial characteristics that are robust to noise.
Ahdid et al. in [7] introduced a notable face recognition scheme that outperforms
the classical Euclidean Distance approaches, as proposed in [70]. However, the
Hamming Distance technique is considered to be an easily applicable and eﬃcient
way to perform matching in various infrastructures as underlined in [15].
Fingerprint Recognition Fingerprint recognition is a challenging task since a
varying number of minutia features and ridges from ﬁngerprint characteristics
need to be matched. Recently, the technique suggested by Palanichamy and
Marimuthu in [161] shows that matching based on distance algorithms can oﬀer
promising recognition accuracy. Although their work contributes to the ﬁeld of
ﬁngerprint recognition, the performance of their proposed image alignment and
the minutia matching algorithms are still under evaluation. The mixed model
of Martin and Cao in [138] is based on a Hamming Distance algorithm. The
authors experimentally analyzed the applicability of their method and presented
the performance improvements, showing reliable results. Therefore, nowadays
their approach is considered to be the basis for the next generation of highly
secure ﬁngerprint-based schemes.
Iris Recognition Hamming Distance algorithms are popular and widely used
in iris recognition methods. Rai and Yadav [169] proposed a technique that
correlates the area of iris for the extraction of the feature, capturing only a
small part of the biometric pattern. The method of minimal data is used in
