User: When using Git to manage code, how to undo the submitted changes and restore to a previous version?
Assistant: You can use the following steps to undo the submitted changes and revert to a previous version: 1. Use the `git log` command to view the previously submitted version number and determine which version to roll back to. For example, the latest version number to fall back to can be found to be `abc123`. 2. Use the `git reset` command to roll back to the specified version. The following command can be used: `git reset --hard abc123`. This will undo all local uncommitted changes and rollback to the specified revision. 3. If the previous version has been pushed to the remote warehouse, you need to use the `git push` command to push the undone changes to the remote warehouse after the rollback, for example: `git push --force origin master`. Note: When rolling back to a previous version, all changes committed after that will be deleted, so use this command with caution.
