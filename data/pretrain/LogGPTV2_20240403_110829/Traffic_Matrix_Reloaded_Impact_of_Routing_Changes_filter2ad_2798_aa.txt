Abstract. A trafﬁc matrix represents the load from each ingress point to each
egress point in an IP network. Although networks are engineered to tolerate some
variation in the trafﬁc matrix, large changes can lead to congested links and poor
performance. The variations in the trafﬁc matrix are caused by statistical ﬂuctua-
tions in the trafﬁc entering the network and shifts in where the trafﬁc leaves the
network. For an accurate view of how the trafﬁc matrix evolves over time, we
combine ﬁne-grained trafﬁc measurements with a continuous view of routing, in-
cluding changes in the egress points. Our approach is in sharp contrast to previous
work that either inferred the trafﬁc matrix from link-load statistics or computed it
using periodic snapshots of routing tables. Analyzing seven months of data from
eight vantage points in a large Internet Service Provider (ISP) network, we show
that routing changes are responsible for the majority of the large trafﬁc varia-
tions. In addition, we identify the shifts caused by internal routing changes and
show that these events are responsible for the largest trafﬁc shifts. We discuss the
implications of our ﬁndings on the accuracy of previous work on trafﬁc matrix
estimation and analysis.

Introduction
The design and operation of IP networks depends on a good understanding of the offered
trafﬁc. Internet Service Providers (ISPs) usually represent the trafﬁc as a matrix of load
from each ingress point to each egress point over a particular time interval. Although
well-provisioned networks are designed to tolerate some ﬂuctuation in the trafﬁc matrix,
large variations break the assumptions used in most designs. In this paper, we investigate
the causes of the trafﬁc matrix variations. Identifying the reasons for these disruptions
is an essential step toward predicting and planning for their occurrence, reacting to them
more effectively, or avoiding them entirely.
The trafﬁc matrix is the composition of the trafﬁc demands and the egress point
selection. We represent the trafﬁc demands during a time interval t as a matrix V (·,·, t),
where each element V (i, p, t) represents the volume of trafﬁc entering at ingress router i
and headed toward a destination preﬁx p. Each ingress router selects the egress point for
each destination preﬁx using the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). We represent the BGP
routing choice as a mapping ε from a preﬁx to an egress point, where ε(i, p, t) represents

the egress router chosen by ingress router i for sending trafﬁc toward destination p. At
time t each element of the trafﬁc matrix T M is deﬁned as:

matrix for this network is T M(i, e, t) = V (i, p1, t) + V (i, p2, t) and T M(i, e(cid:2), t) = 0.

Fluctuations in the trafﬁc demands and changes in the preﬁx-to-egress mapping cause
the trafﬁc matrix to vary. This paper considers the natural question: what are the causes
of large variations in the trafﬁc matrix?
Most previous work on measuring [1–4] and analyzing trafﬁc matrices [5, 6] has
assumed that the preﬁx-to-egress mapping ε is stable. However, relying on periodic
snapshots of routing data runs the risk of associating some trafﬁc measurements with
the wrong elements in the trafﬁc matrix, obscuring real variations in the trafﬁc. In this
paper, we study how changes in ε impact the trafﬁc matrix. A previous analysis of ﬁve
traces of 6–22 hours in duration on the Sprint network [7] shows that most BGP routing
changes do not lead to large trafﬁc shifts. However, given that large trafﬁc variations are
infrequent (yet signiﬁcant) events, we believe that longer traces are necessary to draw
meaningful conclusions. Our previous work [10] shows that internal routing can cause
ε to change for a large number of preﬁxes at the same time, which can potentially cause
a large trafﬁc shift. Neither [7] nor [10] study the signiﬁcance of trafﬁc shifts caused by
routing relative to regular trafﬁc ﬂuctuations, which is the topic of this paper.
In this paper, we study the impact of routing changes on the trafﬁc matrix over a
seven-month period in a tier-1 ISP network. Using Cisco’s Sampled Netﬂow feature [8]
and feeds of internal BGP (iBGP) messages, we compute the trafﬁc demands V and the
preﬁx-to-egress mapping ε for eight ingress routers. Joining these two datasets allows

us to construct a detailed view of the variation of the trafﬁc matrix over time. We also
collect measurements of the intradomain routing protocol [9] in order to identify the
changes in ε that were caused by internal network events, using the algorithm described
in [10]. Our analysis shows that:
1. Although the likelihood of large trafﬁc ﬂuctuations is small, big changes do
sometimes occur. In any given ten-minute time interval, less than 0.02% of the
trafﬁc matrix elements studied have a trafﬁc variation of more than 4 times the
normal trafﬁc variations. However, some elements vary by more than 4 times the
normal variations several times a week.
2. Most routing changes do not cause much variation in the trafﬁc matrix. Previous
studies [7, 11] have shown that routing changes typically do not cause large trafﬁc
shifts; most BGP routing changes affect destination preﬁxes that receive very little
trafﬁc.
3. Routing changes are responsible for many of the large trafﬁc shifts: 58.6% of
instances where a trafﬁc matrix element ﬂuctuated by more than 10 times the normal
variation for that element could be explained by a BGP routing change.
Although routing changes usually do not affect much of the trafﬁc, many of the
large trafﬁc shifts are triggered by routing changes. Large trafﬁc shifts caused by rout-
ing are rare, but important events. After introducing our measurement methodology in
Section 2, we identify the causes of the big variations in Section 3. Section 4 discusses
the implications of our results on other studies of trafﬁc matrices. Section 5 concludes
the paper.
2 Measuring Trafﬁc Matrix Variation
Studying the variation of trafﬁc matrix elements over time requires collecting ﬁne-
grained measurements of trafﬁc and routing. We analyze data collected from a tier-
1 ISP network for 173 days from March to September 2004. We collect data from
eight aggregation routers that receive trafﬁc from customers destined to peers and other
customers. The eight routers are located in major Points of Presence (PoPs) that are
spread throughout the United States.
We compute eight rows of the trafﬁc matrix, considering all trafﬁc from these eight
ingress aggregation routers to all of the egress PoPs. This section describes how we com-
pute the preﬁx-to-egress mapping ε(i, p, t) from the BGP data and the trafﬁc demands
V (i, p, t) from the Netﬂow data. Once we have computed ε and V , we use Equation 1
to compute the elements of the trafﬁc matrix TM(i, e, t). The BGP monitor and the
Netﬂow collection servers are NTP-synchronized, allowing us to use the timestamps to
join the two datasets.
2.1
Preﬁx-to-Egress Mapping
A BGP monitor collects internal BGP update messages directly from each vantage point.
Conﬁgured as a route-reﬂector client of each vantage point, the BGP monitor receives
254
R. Teixeira et al.
updates reporting any change in the best BGP route at each router for each destina-
tion preﬁx. The monitor records each BGP update with a timestamp at the one-second
granularity.
A single network event, such as a failure or policy change, can lead to a burst of
BGP updates messages as the routers explore alternate paths. Rather than studying the
details of routing convergence, our analysis focuses on the changes from one stable
route to another. Similar to previous studies [10, 11], we group the BGP updates for the
same destination preﬁx that have an interarrival time of 70 seconds or less. Our analysis
considers the stable route that existed before the ﬂurry of updates and the new stable
route that exists at the end.
Based on an initial BGP table dump and a sequence of BGP updates, we generate
the preﬁx-to-egress mapping ε(i, p, t) for any given time. The egress point corresponds
to a PoP rather than a speciﬁc router. We associate each egress router with a PoP based
on the router name and conﬁguration data.
2.2
Trafﬁc Demands
Every vantage point has the Cisco’s Sampled Netﬂow feature [8] enabled on all links
that connect to access routers and exports ﬂow records to a collection server at the same
location. The collection server samples the ﬂow records using the technique presented
in [12] in order to reduce processing overhead, and computes 10-minute aggregated
trafﬁc volumes for each destination preﬁx. We use these aggregated reports to extract
V (i, p, t) for each vantage point i and destination preﬁx p at every 10-minute interval.
Consequently, a reference to a time t indicates the end of a 10-minute interval.
Because of sampling, the volumes V (i, p, t) are random quantities that depend on
the sampling outcomes. Through a renormalization applied to the bytes reported in
sampled ﬂow records, the quantities V (i, p, t) are actually unbiased estimators of the
volumes of the original trafﬁc from which they were sampled, i.e., their average over all
possible sampling outcomes is the original volume. The standard error associated with an
aggregate of size V is bounded above by
k/V for some constant k that depends on the
sampling parameters [12]. For the parameters employed in the current case, k < 21MB.
Note that the standard error bound decreases as the size of the aggregate increases. This
property aligns well with our focus on the largest changes in trafﬁc rates: these are the
most reliably estimated. As an example, for a 10-minute aggregate of trafﬁc at a rate of
10 MB per second, the standard error due to sampling is no more than 6%.
(cid:2)
Even though the trafﬁc data is divided into 10-minute intervals, our 70-second group-
ing of BGP updates is important for cases when path exploration crosses the boundary
between two ten-minute intervals. This ensures that we focus our analysis on stable
changes of ε. If the mapping ε(i, p, t) changes more than once in a 10-minute interval,
then we cannot distinguish the volume of trafﬁc affected by each of them individually.
Therefore, we exclude those cases from our analysis by ignoring intervals with preﬁxes
that have more than one stable routing changes in that bin; this excludes 0.05% of the
(i, e, t) tuples from our study. We also exclude all trafﬁc for the small number of ﬂows
that had no matching destination preﬁx in the BGP routing tables or update messages;
we veriﬁed that these ﬂows corresponded to an inﬁnitesimal fraction of the trafﬁc.

3 Causes of Large Trafﬁc Variations
In this section, we explore the contributions of changes in the trafﬁc demands V and
preﬁx-to-egress mapping ε to the variations in the trafﬁc matrix elements TM. Our
analysis shows that, although most changes in ε have a small effect on the trafﬁc matrix,
many of the large variations in the trafﬁc matrix are caused by changes in ε. Also, we
show that, while most changes in ε are caused by external routing events, the small
number of internal routing events are more likely to cause larger shifts in trafﬁc.
3.1
Deﬁnition of Trafﬁc Variations
Figure 2 shows an example of how two trafﬁc matrix elements (with the same ingress
point i) change over the course of a day. The total trafﬁc entering at the ingress point
varies throughout the day, following a typical diurnal cycle. For the most part, the
trafﬁc TM(i, e1, t) has the same pattern, keeping the proportion of trafﬁc destined to e1
relatively constant. For most of the day, no trafﬁc travels from ingress i to egress point
e2. The most signiﬁcant change in the two trafﬁc matrix elements occurs near the end
of the graph. The trafﬁc leaving via egress point e1 suddenly decreases and, at the same
time, trafﬁc leaving via egress point e2 increases. This shift occurred because a routing
change caused most of the trafﬁc with egress point e1 to shift to egress point e2. The
egress point e2 also starts receiving trafﬁc that had previously used other egress points
(not shown in the graph), resulting in an increase for e2 that exceeds the decrease for
e1. In the meantime, the total trafﬁc entering the network at ingress i remained nearly
constant.
The trafﬁc experiences other relatively large downward spikes (labeled as load vari-
ation). These spikes may very well be associated with a routing change in another AS in
