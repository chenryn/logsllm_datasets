A CLUSTERING PARAMETER SELECTION
Our implementation uses the DBSCAN algorithm with a clustering
threshold equal to 8. To select this threshold, we perform the clus-
tering step while varying the distances. Table 6 shows the number
of clusters and the percentage of images that are regarded as noise
by the clustering algorithm for varying distances. We observe that
for distances 2-4 we have a substantially larger percentage of noise,
while with distance 10 we have the least percentage of noise. With
distances between 6 and 8 we observe that we get a larger number

to how “legitimate” some of the content is. To this end, we set out
to measure the quality of KYM by sampling a number of pages and
manually examining them. This is clearly a subjective task, and a
fully specified definition of what makes a valid meme is approx-
imately as difficult as defining “art.” Nevertheless, the authors of
this paper have, for better or worse, collectively spent thousands
of hours immersed in the communities we explore, and thus, while
we are not confident in providing a strict definition of a meme, we
are confident in claiming that we know a meme when we see it.
Using the same randomly selected 200 clusters as mentioned in
Appendix A, we visited each KYM page the cluster was tagged with
and noted whether or not it properly documented what we consider
an “actual” meme. The 200 clusters were mapped to 162 unique
KYM pages, and of these 162 pages, 3 (1.85%) we decided were
“bad.” This is mainly due to the lack of completeness and relatively
high number of random images in the gallery (see [38, 52] for some
examples of “bad” KYM entries).
Next, we set out to determine whether the label (i.e., KYM page)
assigned to each of our randomly sampled clusters was appropriate.
Using three annotators, for each cluster we examined the KYM
page, the medoid of the cluster, and the images in the cluster itself
and noted whether the label does in fact apply to the cluster. Here,
again, there is a great degree of subjectivity. To reign some of the
subjectivity in, we used the following guidelines:
• If the exact image(s) in the cluster appear in the KYM gallery,
then the label is correct.
• For images that do not appear in the KYM gallery, if the label
is appropriate, then it is a correct labeling.
There are some important caveats with these guidelines. First,
KYM galleries are crowdsourced, and while curated to some extent,
the possibility for what amounts to random images in a gallery does
exist; however, based on our assessment of KYM page validity, this
occurs with low probability. Second, we considered a label correct
if it was appropriate, even if it was not necessarily the best possible
label. For example, as our results show, many memes are related,
and many images mix and match pieces of various memes. While
it is definitely true that there might be better labels that exist for
a given cluster, this straightforward and comprehensible labeling
process is sufficient for our purposes. We leave a more in-depth
study of the subjective nature of memes for future work. Finally, it is
important to note that memes are a cultural phenomenon, thus the
potential for cultural bias in our annotation is possible. To that end,
we note that our annotators were born in three different countries
(USA, Italy, and Cyprus), only one is a native English speaker, and
two have spent substantial time in the US.
After annotating clusters, we compute the Fleis agreement score
(κ). With our cluster samples, we achieve a κ of 0.67, which is con-
sidered “substantial” agreement. Finally, for each cluster we obtain
the majority agreement of all annotators to assess the accuracy
of our annotation process; we find that 89% of the clusters had a
legitimate annotation to a specific KYM entry.

of clusters than the other distances, while the noise percentages
are 73% and 63%, respectively. To further evaluate the clustering
performance for varying distances, we randomly select 200 clus-
ters and manually calculate the number of images that are false
positives within each cluster. Fig. 13 shows the CDF of the false
positive fraction in the random sample of clusters for distances 6,8,
and 10 (we disregard distances 2-4 due to the high percentage of
noise). We observe that with distance 10 we have an unacceptably
high fraction of false positives, while for distances 6-8 we observe a
similar behavior with slightly more false positives with distance 8
(in both cases the overall false positives are below 3%). A question
that arises here is what is the impact of those false positives in the
overall dataset? To shed light to this question, we find all posts that
contain false positives and true positives ( from the random sample
of 200 clusters with distance 8). We find that the false positives have
little impact as they occur substantially fewer times than true posi-
tives: the percentage of true positives over the set of false positives
and true positives is 99.4%. Therefore, due to the larger number of
clusters, the acceptable false positive performance, and the smaller
percentage of noise (when compared to distances 2-6), we elect to
use as a threshold the perceptual distance that is equal to 8.
B KYM AND CLUSTERING ANNOTATION
EVALUATION
While KYM might not be a house hold name, the site is seemingly
the largest curated collection of memes on the Web, i.e., KYM is as
close to an “authority” on memes as there is. That said, crowdsourc-
ing is an aspect of how KYM works, and thus there are questions as
