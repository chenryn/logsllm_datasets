User: I wrote an application that stores several things in the registry. When I first started, I added them to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, but kept getting permission errors writing to the. So, it was suggested that I use HKEY_CURRENT_USER, that worked until I realized that I am not able to access them from another account. How can I write to the registry but allow all accounts to access read and write to it?
I used the Python module _winreg.
Assistant: If you want to write to the registry so that all users can read it, you will need to run your program with administrator privileges.  
You might be happier storing your information in a file instead, which will be easier to manage.
