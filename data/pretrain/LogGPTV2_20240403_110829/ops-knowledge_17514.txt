User: Please describe the identity authentication and authorization method based on cryptography technology, and provide an application scenario.
Assistant: The identity authentication and authorization methods based on cryptography technology mainly include the following two types: 1. The identity authentication and authorization method based on certificates, which confirm the user's identity and authority by using certificates. 2. A token-based identity authentication and authorization method, through the use of tokens to confirm the user's identity and authority. One application scenario is online banking. Users need to perform identity authentication and authorization when logging in to online banking to ensure transaction security. In this case, certificate-based authentication and authorization methods are relatively more reliable and secure. Users can prove their identity to the bank through digital certificates stored locally, and ensure the security of transactions through digital signatures and encryption. At the same time, the bank can confirm the user's identity and authority by sending a mobile token or hardware token to the user after the user logs in, and perform authorization operations to ensure that only authenticated and authorized users can conduct transactions. This can effectively protect the interests of users and the safety of the bank.
