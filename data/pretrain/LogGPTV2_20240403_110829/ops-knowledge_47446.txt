Assistant: Existence of exception: Existence of exception Exception type: System exception Exception reason/solution: The error log is the RAS KERNEL INFO log generated by the IBM RS/6000 AIX operating system, showing that a CE sym 2 error has occurred. According to IBM's official documentation, CE sym errors refer to the detection of single or multiple bit errors in system memory. This error is usually caused by a hardware failure, such as a failure in system memory or other storage devices, or because of a problem with a hardware component such as the CPU. Therefore, you should check the hardware devices of the system to confirm whether there are faults in hardware components such as system memory, CPU, and storage devices. If a hardware component is faulty, the faulty part needs to be replaced, and if the hardware is normal, a complete system check of the system needs to be performed. After checking, the operating system needs to be restarted to restore the service.
