### Analysis
**LinkedIn:**
- LinkedIn is primarily used for professional networking, such as finding jobs or employees. It is natural to expect that users on LinkedIn focus more on browsing profiles and creating connections with other professionals rather than engaging in extensive messaging.

**MySpace:**
- Despite the similarity in services offered by MySpace and Orkut, MySpace showed a different activity profile. Specifically, there was much lower interaction through photos on MySpace.
- A detailed analysis of the data revealed that 90% of MySpace users also accessed one of the other three social networks, with 75% of them accessing Orkut. This suggests that users who accessed MySpace through a social network aggregator were likely using it in conjunction with other platforms.

This structured format and clear labeling should make the information more accessible and easier to understand.
