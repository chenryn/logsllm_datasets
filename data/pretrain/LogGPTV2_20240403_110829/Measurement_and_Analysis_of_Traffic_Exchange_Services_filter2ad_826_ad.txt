### Exclusion of Top Domains from the Study

The top domains—twistrix.com, hitlink.com, paragonmailer.com, and paragontrafﬁc.com—were not included in our study. Upon reviewing their websites, we found that these exchanges offer a share in a cash pot (worth approximately $10) at the end of every month to the top 25 active users. Members can earn activity points towards a share in the cash pot by submitting their member-specific exchange promotion link on other exchanges.

### Traffic Quality and Size of Exchange Networks

In this section, we analyze the quality of traffic delivered by exchange networks and measure the scale and characteristics of the IP address population participating in these exchanges. Our observations are based on purchasing bulk views from the exchanges over five consecutive days and recording the characteristics of the visitors.

#### Infrastructure Setup

We set up eight websites, one for each exchange, on Amazon EC2, configured to auto-scale to handle large traffic peaks. The websites were designed to be simple and identical, resembling a photo blog. We used JavaScript instrumentation to detect:
- Mouse movement
- Whether the visitor was logged into Google, Twitter, or Facebook at the time of the visit

While not perfect, this instrumentation provides a sense of organic (real) user participation. Where possible, we requested views with a duration of at least 30 seconds to allow the JavaScript to execute. We also set cookies to study the behavior of returning visitors.

We signed up for two premium accounts on each exchange, allowing us to access more website slots and submit multiple pages to receive bulk traffic. This approach enabled us to collect independent samples of the IP addresses in each exchange.

#### Purchases and Order Completion

Table 6 details the breakdown of traffic we purchased from each exchange. For each exchange, we started with a pilot measurement of 100K visitors per day for autosurf and 10K visitors per day for manual exchanges. Subsequent purchases were scaled down, requesting at least twice as many visitors as the number of unique IP addresses observed in the pilot measurement.

For each purchase, we requested visitors distributed across multiple pages of our corresponding website, with a maximum rate of 250 visitors per hour per page. This ensured the expected completion time for the purchase order was one day. The exchanges varied in their ability to fulfill orders. HitSafari, 247AutoHits, and 10Khits fulfilled only 50%, 63%, and 68% of the orders, respectively, and charged us only for what they could deliver. Our measurements indicate that these three are the smallest of the eight exchanges, with around a thousand IP addresses each, explaining their inability to fulfill larger orders within a day. Other exchanges claimed to fulfill complete orders but had some losses, with discrepancies between the exchange's reported data and our web server logs. Specifically, Jingling fulfilled only 61% of the order on average, while others had losses ranging from 2% to 12%.

### Quality of Delivered Views

The views were delivered from a variety of User-Agents, with most exchanges delivering traffic from several hundred different User-Agents. Notably, Jingling delivered traffic from approximately 33,000 different User-Agents, primarily different versions of Internet Explorer. Since we did not request a custom Referer, the Referer received was the link of the traffic exchange for all exchanges except Jingling, where it was absent.

Page components (stylesheets, JavaScript) hosted on the same domain were fetched for 92–100% of IP addresses across the different exchanges. An image embedded from a different domain was fetched for 86–100% of IP addresses for all exchanges except Jingling, where only 1% of the IP addresses fetched the image. JavaScript was executed for 83–97% of the IP addresses on six of the exchanges. On Jingling, the execution rate was much lower (37%), possibly due to high load on the machines running Jingling. For 10Khits, the JavaScript instrumentation fired for only 20% of the IP addresses, and upon investigation, our web logs indicated that the POST request paths were malformed, resulting in no data being logged for mouse movement and social-network login instrumentation. This is likely because 10Khits was in a transitional phase, using a potentially buggy version of their autosurf tool.

### Characterization of View Sources/IP Addresses

Over the five days, we received visits from approximately 204,000 unique IP addresses across the eight exchanges, corresponding to about 93,000 unique /24 network prefixes. 77–95% of the /24 prefixes had only one IP address, suggesting that a significant fraction of these IP addresses belong to individual machines (or NATs), with little IP aliasing.

#### Manual Exchanges

- **HitSafari**: Recorded 1,000 IP addresses from 73 countries.
- **EasyHits4U**: Recorded 6,000 IP addresses from 128 countries.

On HitSafari, 40% of the IP addresses had an account logged into a social network, and 10% showed mouse movements. On EasyHits4U, 65% of the IP addresses had a social network login, and 21% showed mouse movements. The low percentage of mouse movements suggests that users do the bare minimum required to get paid.

Geolocation data indicates that 52% of the IP addresses on EasyHits4U come from Europe, with Asia as the second major contributor (25%). In HitSafari, North America has a 40% contribution, followed by Europe (31%) and Asia (22%).

#### Autosurf Exchanges

- **247AutoHits and 10Khits**: Small in size, with about 1,500 IP addresses each.
- **Otohits**: Approximately 4,000 IP addresses.
- **eBesucher, HitLeap, and Jingling**: An order of magnitude larger.

**Geolocation:**
- **eBesucher**: Highly concentrated in Europe (80%), with Russia, Ukraine, and Germany predominant.
- **Jingling**: Highest representation in Asia (70%), with China contributing 56% of the IP addresses.
- **HitLeap**: Predominantly based in North America (63%), with 60% of IP addresses from the US.
- **Otohits**: Representation in North America (47%) and Europe (26%), with the US predominant (45%).

**Organic Visitors:**
- **247AutoHits**: 43% of visitors from machines where a user was logged into a social network, but only 6% showed mouse movements.
- **eBesucher and Otohits**: Approximately 12% and 13% of visitors, respectively, from machines with a social network login.
- **Jingling**: Only 0.1% of visitors appeared organic, with 1–4% showing mouse movements.

**Popular ASNs:**
- **HitLeap and Jingling**: A significant portion of IP addresses belong to Amazon (≈ 38,000 IP addresses).
- **Autosurf Exchanges**: A significant portion of IP addresses from Google’s cloud (≈ 27,000 IP addresses).

### Overlap Across Exchanges

There was very little overlap across the IP address space of the manual and autosurf exchanges. However, within these categories, we observed significant overlaps. For example, 17% of HitSafari’s IP address space overlapped with EasyHits4U, and 43% of 10Khits’ IP address space overlapped with HitLeap, 247AutoHits, and eBesucher.
