changes that appear in the top domains—twistrix.com, hitlink.com,
paragonmailer.com, and paragontrafﬁc.com—were not included in
our study. Looking through their websites, we ﬁnd that these ex-
changes offer a share in a cash pot (worth ≈ $10) at the end of
every month to the top 25 active users. Submitting the member-
speciﬁc exchange promotion link on other exchanges is one of the
ways in which members can earn activity points towards a share in
the cash pot.
6. TRAFFIC QUALITY & SIZE OF EX-
CHANGE NETWORKS
In this section we study the quality of trafﬁc that the exchange
networks deliver, and measure the scale and characteristics of the
IP address population that participates in these exchanges. We base
our observations on buying bulk views from the exchanges for ﬁve
consecutive days and recording the characteristics of the visitors.
Infrastructure: We set up eight websites, one per exchange,
on Amazon EC2, conﬁgured to auto-scale in order to handle large
peaks of trafﬁc. The websites themselves were fairly simplis-
tic, and identical in content, appearing to be a photo blog. We
employed Javascript instrumentation on the websites to detect (i)
mouse movement, and (ii) whether at the time of visit the visitor
was logged into any of Google, Twitter, or Facebook.5 While not
perfect, this instrumentation gives us a sense of organic (real) users
participating in these exchanges. Where possible, we requested
views for a view-length of 30s or greater, in order to allow enough
time for the instrumentation Javascript to execute. We also set
cookies to study the behavior of returning visitors.
We signed up for two premium accounts on each exchange, and
purchased views from the exchanges alternating between the ac-
counts every other day. Premium accounts gave us access to more
website slots on the exchanges, enabling us to submit multiple
pages of our websites in order to get bulk trafﬁc. Making purchases
from two accounts arguably enables us to collect independent sam-
ples of the IP addresses in an exchange.
Purchases: Table 6 lists the breakdown of trafﬁc we bought
from each exchange. For each exchange, we started with a pilot
measurement of 100K visitors per day for autosurf and 10K visi-
tors per day for manual exchanges,6 and scaled down the number of
visitors in subsequent purchases, requesting at least twice as many
visitors as the number of unique IP addresses observed in the pilot
measurement.
Purchase Order Completion: For each purchase, we requested
visitors distributed across multiple pages of our corresponding
website (at a maximum rate of 250 visitors per hour per page),7
so that the expected completion time for the purchase order was
one day. The exchanges varied in the completion of purchase or-
der. HitSafari, 247AutoHits, and 10Khits on average fulﬁlled only
50/63/68% of the order, and charged us only for what they were
able to fulﬁll. Our measurements indicate that these three are the
smallest of the eight exchanges we measured (on the order of a
thousand IP addresses), explaining the inability to fulﬁll larger or-
5We used the methodology described at http://www.tomanthony.co.uk/
blog/detect-visitor-social-networks/.
6We made smaller purchases from manual exchanges due to higher
cost of manual trafﬁc.
7The exchanges set upper bounds on the number of visits per URL
per hour, e.g., 500 for HitLeap and 1,000 for eBesucher. We re-
quested a limit lower than the upper bound based on a pilot run that
found the upper bound did not get delivered in a timely fashion.

ders within a day. Others claimed to fulﬁll the complete orders, but
had some losses—the instrumentation reported by the exchange did
not match that recorded by our web server logs. Speciﬁcally, Jin-
gling fulﬁlled only 61% of the order on average; others had a loss
in the range 2–12%.
6.1 Quality of delivered views
The views were delivered from a variety of User-Agents by de-
fault, on the order of several hundred for most of the exchanges.
Most notably, Jingling delivered trafﬁc from ≈ 33K different
user-agents (dominated by different versions of Internet Explorer).
Since we did not request a custom Referer, the Referer we
received was the link of the trafﬁc exchange for all the exchanges
except Jingling, for which it was not present.
The page components (stylesheet, Javascript) hosted on the same
domain were fetched for 92–100% of IP addresses of the differ-
ent exchanges. An image embedded from a different domain was
fetched for 86–100% of IP addresses for all exchanges except Jin-
gling, for which only 1% of the IP addresses fetched the image.
We found that Javascript was executed for 83–97% of the IP ad-
dresses on six of the exchanges. On Jingling, the number is much
lower (37%)—this could be due to high load on the machines that
run Jingling, because it initiates multiple threads and views multi-
ple websites in parallel. For 10Khits, the Javascript instrumentation
ﬁred for only 20% of the IP addresses. Further, upon investigation,
our web logs indicated that for the IP addresses where it did ﬁre,
the POST request paths were malformed, hence no data was logged
in our database for the mouse movement and social-network login
instrumentation. This is presumably because at the time of our data
collection, the 10Khits website indicated it was in a transitional
phase, soon to launch their own autosurf tool. Perhaps the hits to
our websites were delivered by a buggy version of the tool.
6.2 Characterization of View Sources/IP ad-
dresses
Over the ﬁve days, we received visits to our websites from
≈ 204K unique IP addresses across the eight exchanges, corre-
sponding to ≈ 93K unique /24 network preﬁxes. 77–95% of the
/24 preﬁxes have only one IP address, suggesting that a signiﬁcant
fraction of these IP addresses belong to individual machines (or
NATs), with little IP aliasing.
6.2.1 Manual Exchanges
We recorded 1K IP addresses on HitSafari from 73 countries, and
6K on EasyHits4U from 128 countries. Of these, 40% on HitSafari

Table 6: Our purchases from various exchanges to study the quality of trafﬁc. We purchased trafﬁc in varying quantities, and recorded the
HTTP requests, page rendering, and organic-visitor instrumentation over ﬁve days.
and 65% on EasyHits4U had an account logged into a social net-
work, indicating that a signiﬁcant fraction of views came from real
users (or compromised machines). Our instrumentation recorded
mouse movements for 10% and 21% of IP addresses on HitSafari
and EasyHits4U respectively. The low percentage is presumably
because the users do the bare minimum required to get paid.
Finding these organic visitor indicators, we next investigate
whether this trafﬁc comes from real users in low-wage countries
who click intentionally in the hope of earning money. We looked at
the top ASNs, and ﬁnd that the trafﬁc mostly comes from residen-
tial networks, with no single dominant contributor. Surprisingly,
geo-location (using the MaxMind database) indicates that 52% of
the IP addresses in EasyHits4U come from Europe, with Asia the
second major contributor (25%). The IP addresses from Europe
are dominated by Russia, Romania, and Ukraine with each hav-
ing 5–6% representation. IP addresses from Asia are dominated
by India and Indonesia. In HitSafari, North America has a 40%
contribution, followed by Europe (31%), and Asia (22%). We ﬁnd
that the country distribution in HitSafari differs from that in Easy-
Hits4U, with UK and Germany having the top representation (but
only 4–5% each) in Europe, and China and Singapore dominating
IP addresses from Asia.
In light of this geographic diversity and the signiﬁcant contribu-
tions from North America and Western Europe, click farms in low-
wage countries do not appear to be the principal source of clicks on
manual exchanges.
6.2.2 Autosurf Exchanges
Our measurements ﬁnd that
the basic autosurf exchanges,
247AutoHits and 10Khits, are small in size, on the order of 1.5K IP
addresses each. However, in the advanced autosurf category Oto-
hits has ≈ 4K IP addresses, while the other three are an order of
magnitude larger.
Geolocation: We received hits from 80–147 different countries
across the various autosurf exchanges. The spread over countries
for the smaller networks differed from that of the larger ones:
eBesucher is highly concentrated (80%) in Europe, with Russia,
Ukraine and Germany predominant. Jingling has the highest rep-
resentation in Asia (70%), with China contributing 56% of the IP
addresses. The second major contributor in both eBesucher and Jin-
gling is North America, with 15% and 28% representation respec-
tively. HitLeap’s network is predominantly based in North America
(63%), with 60% of IP addresses from the US. 20% of HitLeap’s
IP address space is based in Europe, with Italy and Germany the
top contributors (but only 4–5% IP addresses each). Similar to
HitLeap, Otohits has representation in North America (47%) and
Europe (26%), with the US predominant (45%), and Taiwan, Viet-
nam and Germany each at 5%.
For the smaller networks, 247AutoHits and 10Khits, Asia and
Europe have 74% representation. The country distribution is dis-
persed, with Vietnam, Indonesia, India, Germany, and the UK as
the popular countries (4–8% representation).
Organic Visitors: The trafﬁc recorded from 247AutoHits had
the highest percentage of visitors from machines where a user was
logged in to a social network (43%), but only 6% indicated a mouse
movement. For the advanced autosurf exchanges, it is possible that
the user uses a browser different than that used by the autosurf tool.
Hence we treat the estimates we discuss below as a lower bound.
We ﬁnd that on average ≈ 12% of the visitors from eBesucher, and
≈ 13% on Otohits, were from machines where a user was logged in
to a social network.8 In contrast, the number is much lower for Jin-
gling; only 0.1% of the visitors appear organic. We recorded mouse
movement for only 1–4% of IP addresses on these exchanges.
We could not carry out this analysis for HitLeap and 10Khits,
because (i) HitLeap’s autosurf tool uses a built-in browser rather
than a browser on the user’s machine, and thus none of the visitors
appeared to have logged in, when in fact they might have been, and
(ii) as described in Section 6.1, the 10Khits surf tool had malformed
URL request paths, due to which we did not log any data in our
database.
Popular ASNs: We next take a look at the popular enti-
ties/organizations to which the IP addresses of exchange networks
belong. We obtain the ASNs of the IP addresses via Team Cymru’s
IP-to-ASN mappings database [36]. Table 7 lists the popular ASNs
(those having at least a 5% representation), and the corresponding
percentage of IP addresses observed for each exchange. We ﬁnd
that a striking percentage of the IP addresses in the HitLeap and Jin-
gling exchanges belong to Amazon, totaling ≈ 38K IP addresses.
Similarly, a signiﬁcant portion of IP addresses in the autosurf ex-
changes comes from Google’s cloud, totaling ≈ 27K IP addresses.
We also observe other smaller cloud providers and Internet host-
ing/data centers in the top ﬁve ASNs. For example, the second-
highest contribution in eBesucher’s network comes from Hetzner
Online (5%), an Internet hosting provider and data center operator
based in Germany. Similarly, HitLeap addresses also appear from
other smaller cloud providers such as Limestone Networks [17] and
OVH [21].
6.2.3 Overlap across exchanges
We ﬁnd very little overlap across the IP address space of the man-
ual and autosurf exchanges. However, within these categories, we
observe signiﬁcant overlaps. 17% of HitSafari’s IP address space
8Conceivably, there is a small chance that there is a fraudster run-
ning social media promotion tools in parallel; we do not have a
method for verifying whether the user on a machine is genuine.
