(b) considering all domains
Fig. 1. Content delivery potential of the top 20 ASes.
Figure 1a shows that the ASes of the examined ISP indeed hosts most of the
popular domains. For instance, 95% of the popular domains can be served by
ISP-AS4, and the top ranked one hosts about 60%. This observation implies that
popular domains are well replicated in the examined ISP. The Apple’s AS has a
lower CDP, indicating that it appears in the list because of the frequent access
of its domains from smartdevices, rather than hosting lots of domains.
When considering all domains in Fig. 1b, no AS hosts over 6% of the domains.
This is within our expectation because most of the domains are only available
in one single AS. It is also interesting to see that Alibaba cloud hosts the largest
number of domains; Tencent cloud also hosts a signiﬁcant fraction. The reason
should be that some content owners, especially those of non-popular domains,
outsource their domains to the clouds for easy maintenance and low access delay.
We further examine whether the listed ASes serve diﬀerent or similar content
in Fig. 2. An AS is associated with a content serving vector, and the i-th element
is , where hi is a SLD and ci is the number of queries on hi that
are mapped to the AS. We compute the similarity between two ASes using

Fig. 2. Cosine similarity between each pair of ASes
the cosine similarity between their content serving vectors. Several observations
are notable. First, the similarity values between the examined ISP’s ASes are
relative low, despite of the high content availability in the ASes. It seems that
the ISP hosts diﬀerent content in diﬀerent ASes. Second, the relatively high
similarity between Akamai’s ASes and ISPs’ ASes is an evidence that Akamai has
already replicated content into ISPs, including the examined one and those that
own China169 and Chinanet. Third, Alibaba and Tencent clouds host content
that other ASes do not have, evidenced by the low similarity with other ASes.
This is also conﬁrmed by the high CMI values of these two ASes (see the last
column of Table 1). Fourth, the high similarity between Apple and the ASes of
Chinanet implies that Apple’s content is available in Chinanet’s ISP, but not
the examined one. This is a potential performance bottleneck for the ISP’s users
to access Apple’s content. Last but not least, Yahoo and Google’s ASes host
totally diﬀerent content from others. This is because domains like google.com,
ﬂickr.com are blocked for access in China, so their content is not replicated to
the ASes under consideration [8].
The above analysis, however, does not reveal the reasons of the presence
of ISPs’ ASes in Table 1. In fact, there are two possibilities. First, ISPs host
content of popular domains that other ASes do not have, so that the queries of
these domains can only be mapped to the ISPs’ ASes. Second, content hosting
providers deploy their content servers into the ISPs to boost the content delivery
performance. Both cases may lead to a high CDP of an AS.
The content monopoly index (CMI, see Sect. 2) is used to investigate the ﬁrst
possibility. We observe low CMI values when considering only the top 10,000
domains (see the 4th column of Table 1), indicating that these ASes do not
exclusively host content of popular domains that others do not have. When
considering all domains, we observe high CMI values for some ASes, because they
106
Z. Li et al.
host lots of non-popular domains that are only available in the ASes. Moreover,
the extremely high CMI values of the Alibaba cloud and Tencent cloud are
further evidence of the trend of outsourcing content to clouds for non-popular
domains that are less replicated.
For the second possibility, we aim at identifying the major content hosting
providers. We do so in the next subsection by applying spectrum clustering on
the bipartite graph formed by IP /24 subnets and domains.
3.2 Content Hosting Provider Analysis
Let M ∈ R
We identify major hosting providers by clustering servers (identiﬁed by IP
addresses) that are run by the same hosting provider. For this purpose, we
form a bipartite graph, where one type of nodes is SLD, and the other is IP
/24 subnet. An edge is present between a SLD node and a subnet node if the
domain is mapped to the subnet in our dataset. Each edge is associated with a
weight, which is deﬁned later in this section. The key idea of clustering is that
the /24 subnets used by a hosting provider serve the similar domains, and thus
are densely connected through domains. Graph partitioning algorithms can thus
be used for the clustering purpose.
m×n be the matrix representation of the bipartite graph. M would
be a sparse matrix, where rows are domains (i.e., SLDs), and columns represent
/24 subnets. Mij is the weight of the edge between the i-th domain and the j-th
subnet. We set Mij = 1.0+log(qij), where qij is the number of queries of the i-th
domain that are mapped to the j-th subnet. The intuition of weight setting is
that the higher qij is, the more likely that the j-th subnet belongs to the hosting
providers that deliver the i-th domain’s content. We discard domains that are
mapped to only one subnet to reduce the dimensionality. We ﬁnally apply a
graph partitioning algorithm based on spectral clustering [14], as summarized in
Algorithm 1, on M.

Each cluster yielded from the above algorithm represents a content hosting
provider. To label the owners of clusters, we resort to the IP usage information
from the examined ISP as well as third parties. The examined ISP maintains a
table recording who uses which IP addresses (often represented in IP ranges). If
there is one /24 subnet in a cluster belonging to the examined ISP, we looked
up the table using the /24 subnet as key and get the entity name of the /24
subnet, which is further used as the owner of the clusters. Otherwise, we looked
up third-party databases (e.g., whois utility, MaxMind1) to infer cluster owners.
We ﬁnd two exceptions during the labeling process. First, some clusters are
labeled multiple owners. This happens because some domains, may leverage
several CDNs for content distribution. For instance, Both Netﬂix and Hulu use
three CDNs: Akamai, LimeLight and Level-3 [6]. The /24 subnets of these CDNs
may be clustered into one cluster as they are connected by the same domains. We
label them as mixed. Second, some owners have multiple clusters. This happens
because an owner may provide multiple types of services, and it slices up its
hosting infrastructure to host diﬀerent services. For instance, Tencent uses one
cluster of subnets for multimedia objects delivery and one for social network
service hosting. In this case, we further infer the major services that a cluster
provides by examining the domains in the cluster.
In total, we get 922 clusters. Table 2 lists the top 15 clusters, along with
their network footprints and owners2 These clusters account for over 50% of the
queries. We can see the owners indeed are the major providers that provide a
large amount of mobile content in China. As expected, the mixed ones contain
more /24 subnets and have footprints in much more ASes than other clusters,
because they contain several CDNs. The major CDN players in China, like Chi-
naCache and ChinaNetCenter, are included in the mixed clusters, because they
are used by several popular Internet video providers (e.g., PPTV, iQiyi).
The four clusters owned by Tencent distinguish from each other in the services
that they provide. For instance, the ﬁrst-ranked cluster hosts Tencent multime-
dia objects, while the second hosts Tencent social networks. We make similar
observations for the Baidu’s clusters. Xiaomi (a smartphone maker) appears in
the list, because of the huge number of users using its smartphones, which fre-
quently contact its cloud center for storage/retrieval of personal data, software
download etc. Alibaba, on the other hand, hosts its own services (like alipay),
as well as the outsourced content to it.
Akamai’s clusters were identiﬁed by the prevalence of akacdn.com and
akamaiedge.net in the clusters. Nevertheless, the /24 subnets do not neces-
sarily belong to Akamai’s AS, but the partners that Akamai collaborate with in
China. Finally, we see Apple and Google in the list because of their prevalence in
1 MaxMind: www.maxmind.com.
2 We manually cross-checked the CNAMEs of the popular domains (FQDNs) in non-
mixed clusters to validate the clustering approach. For example, the popular domains
in both Baidu clusters use the CNAMEs with the same suﬃx shifen.com, which is
run by Baidu.

3.3 Summary and Discussion
Our analysis in this section has revealed that the cellular content infrastructure
is mostly concentrated in the examined ISP’s ASes. This implies a signiﬁcant
