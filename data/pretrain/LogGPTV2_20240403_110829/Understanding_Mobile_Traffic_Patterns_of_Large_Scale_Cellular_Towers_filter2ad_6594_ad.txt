traﬃc X. Figure 12(a) shows the DFT of the aggregate
traﬃc of all cellular towers, where three peaks are observed,
i.e. k =4, 28, 56. Since the duration of our series is 4 weeks,
the 4th point is corresponding to time-domain periodic pat-
terns of one week. Similarly, the 28th and 56th points stand
for the time-domain periodic patterns of one day and half a
day, respectively. The absolute values of the three compo-
nents are much higher than the rest of points, which suggests
that most information of the time-domain traﬃc could be
retained by the three components. Motivated by this hint,
we use the three components for presenting the time-domain
traﬃc. To evaluate the information loss of ignoring the rest
of frequency components, we reconstruct the time-domain
traﬃc using the three main frequency components, which is
expressed as follows:
0,
ˆX r[k] =( ˆX[k],
N PN −1
xr[n] = 1
k=0
if k =0, 4, 28, 56, N -4, N -28, N -56,
otherwise,
ˆX r[k]e2πikn/N ,
where xr[n] is the reconstructed time-domain traﬃc. The
reconstructed time-domain traﬃc of the aggregate traﬃc
of all cellular towers is also shown in Figure 12(b). From
the result, we can observe that the reconstructed curve is
very close to the original curve. Speciﬁcally, the lost energy,
n=1 x[n]2, is less than 6% relative to the to-
n=1 x[n]2, which suggests
the negligible energy contributed by frequency components
beyond the three main components.

To further understand the capability of signal reconstruc-
tion using the three points, we analyze the variance of am-
plitude of DFT at each frequency component for diﬀerent
cellular tower, and the result is shown in Figure 13. We can
observe that the DFT variances of the three frequency com-
ponents are larger compared to the rest. In addition, we use
the DFT to analyse the aggregate traﬃc for cellular towers

of the four primary traﬃc patterns in Figure 14. We can
ﬁnd that the reconstructed curves are also very close to the
original curves, and their DFT spectrum varies most signif-
icantly at the three frequency components, which suggests
that these three frequencies are the most important compo-
nents in distinguishing towers of diﬀerent traﬃc patterns as
well as constructing a time-domain traﬃc.
5.2 Visualized Analysis in Frequency Domain
In order to better understand the ﬁve traﬃc patterns of
towers in frequency domain, we now provide visualized fre-
quency analysis of them. In addition, based on our earlier
observation in Section 5.1, we only analyze the three fre-
quencies corresponding to one week, one day, and half a
day. Since each DFT point is a complex number, we ana-
lyze the distribution of its amplitude and phase extracted

by the following expressions:

k and P m
where Am
k are the amplitude and phase of DFT
for tower m at the kth frequency component. The larger
amplitude reﬂects the stronger periodicity at corresponding
frequency, while diﬀerent phases of DFT indicate diﬀerent
peak time or valley time. Intuitively, for example, larger Am
indicates the cellular tower m is located at the area that
is signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by the holiday at the weekend,
such as oﬃce and entertainment area. On the other hand,
since the traﬃc peak at oﬃce area tends to be reached at
weekdays, while it at entertainment area tends to be reached
at weekends, their P m
28 will have much diﬀerence. Thus,
by frequency analysis, we can quantify the inherent time-
domain periodicity of traﬃc, which is diﬃcult to achieve by
the time domain analysis.

Figure 15 shows the distribution of the amplitude and
phase of towers deployed in the comprehensive, residential,
oﬃce, transport, and entertainment areas. Meanwhile, mean-
s and standard deviations of the amplitude and phase for
towers at the three frequency components of towers in the 4
types of areas are presented in Figure 16.
From Figure 15(a) and Figure 16(a), we can observe that
towers in oﬃce area have the strongest periodicity of one
week. Their phases mainly concentrate around 1.35, while
the phase of towers in residential and entertainment area
centers around -1.65, about π away from 1.35. This π sepa-
ration suggests that towers in residential and entertainment
area have reverse traﬃc characteristics as that in the oﬃce
area in the scale of one week.
As we can observe in Figure 15(b), the distribution of
towers is continuous with respect to the phase of one day.
Moreover, it shows a smooth traﬃc transition from residen-
tial area to comprehensive and transport area, and ﬁnally
to oﬃce area. On the other hand, according to our priori
knowledge, the human migration ﬂow usually leads to the
peaks of traﬃc of areas appear sequentially with the same
order that the ﬂow passes through, which coincides with
our observed phenomenon. Thus, such transition suggests
the human migration ﬂow from home to oﬃce via transport
during rush hours.
In Figure 16(b), we can also observe
that the means of their phase are incremental with the same
order.
Figure 15(c) and Figure 16(c) show characteristics of the
amplitude and phase of the frequency component which s-
tands for half a day. The amplitude of this frequency com-
ponent indicates the strength of double-hump characteris-
tic.
In Figure 16(c), we can observe that the amplitude
of towers in transport area is the largest, indicating their
strongest double-hump characteristic. This result coincides
with our priori knowledge that there are two rush hours of
transport area in the morning and evening, respectively. In
Figure 15(c), we ﬁnd that traﬃc of residential and oﬃce area
are not separated by traﬃc of transport area. This observa-
tion is not contradictory to our pervious analysis because the
234directions of people commute in the morning and afternoon
are reversed.
Overall, the amplitude and phase of the three frequency
components show a strong capability of diﬀerentiating tow-
ers with diﬀerent traﬃc patterns. Based on the observations,
we make the following statements. First, the most represen-
tative tower in each cluster is not the centroid. In fact, it
is the farthest non-noise point from the hyperplanes, which
separate clusters. To understand this problem, let us think
about the points around a hyperplane, where we observe
similar traﬃc patterns of points even though they belong
to diﬀerent clusters. In geographical context, these towers
are deployed in areas of mixed urban functions. In contrast,
the points far from the separating hyperplane are located
at areas of a single urban function. Although perhaps not
the most representative points, cluster centroids can well
characterize the traﬃc patterns since they are distant from
others clusters.
Second, the frequency-domain features of towers are dis-
tributed in a polygon. Such polygon is formed because the
proﬁle of each cluster in Figure 15 has a cigar shape. Thus,
diﬀerent features of towers can be regarded as being linear
relevant or piecewise linear relevant approximately, which
overlayed with a Gaussian noise can form the cluster with
the cigar shape. As a result, a point in the frequency domain
can be seen as a linear combination of the four vertex of the
polygon, i.e., the four most representative points, which we
call as the four primary components.
To illustrate these two statements, we plot the distribu-
tion of towers and corresponding polygon in Figure 17. For
better understanding, we only show three features, includ-
ing amplitude and phase of one day, and amplitude of half
day. According to our ﬁrst statement, the most representa-
tive tower in each cluster is the furthest one from the hyper-
plane. Speciﬁcally, we do not calculate the hyperplanes, and
only search for points with largest distance from points of
other clusters. In addition, we use the density of the towers,
i.e., the number of towers within a ﬁxed distance away from
it in the feature space, as a decision function to ensure that
the tower is not a noise point. Figure 17 shows that all the
towers are distributed in or along the edge and plane of the
polygon, as we discussed above.
5.3 Component Analysis of Cellular Towers
in Comprehensive Area
Based on the statements above, we may use a linear com-
bination of the four most representative cellular towers to
present each point in the polygon. By looking at the coef-
ﬁcient of each primary component, we can obtain the per-
centage of corresponding urban function of the area where
an arbitrary cellular tower is deployed. We formulate the
process of obtaining the coeﬃcients as a quadratic program-
ming problem, which is shown below:
where ||·|| is the 2-norm of a vector, F is the feature of the
target tower, F 0
is the feature of the most representative
i
tower for cluster i in the frequency domain, and xi is the
obtained coeﬃcient for cluster i. In this example, the fea-
ture of tower m, F m, is (Am
