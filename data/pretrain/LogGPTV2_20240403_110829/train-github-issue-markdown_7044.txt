#### What I expect to happen:
Given the following file:
    // Polygon.js
    class Polygon {  
      constructor(height, width) {
        this.height = height;
        this.width = width;
      }
      get area() {
        return this.calcArea()
      }
      calcArea() {
        return this.height * this.width;
      }
    }
I would expect the command _`babel Polygon.js`_ to emit ES5-compatible code.
#### What _actually_ happens:
The same ES6 file is returned, unmodified.
There are no errors to report.
#### Other
  * I installed `babel` and then `babel-cli` globally. I tried on Node 4.2.1 and Node 0.12.7. I am running on Ubuntu 15.04.
  * I got the above code example from _this tutorial_.
  * This problem is not specific to the _Polygon.js_ example above. I used that as an example. I tried `babel` with numerous stand-alone scripts (including ones _without_ classes) and the problem persists.
