Previously with the chocolatey based install I was able to open a command
prompt and type `atom .` to open atom in the current folder, and after that
command executed, my prompt would simply continue and allow me to do other
things in the folder.
After the new install, when I type `atom .` I get the following output:
    Î» atom .
    App load time: 147ms
    [4124:1211/011828:INFO:renderer_main.cc(204)] Renderer process started
    [4656:1211/011830:INFO:CONSOLE(64)] "Window load time: 2304ms", source: file:///C:/Users//AppData/Local/atom/app-0.156.0/resources/app/static/index.js (64)
    [4656:1211/011833:INFO:CONSOLE(536)] "Error deactivating package 'keybinding-resolver'", source: c:\Users\\AppData\Local\atom\app-0.156.0\resources\app\src\package.js (536)
And it blocks my prompt. I can either close Atom to get back to my prompt or
CTRL-C (which obviously kills Atom)
Is it possible to get the old behaviour back?
