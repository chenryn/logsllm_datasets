# XSS Worms and Their Evolution

## Introduction to XSS Worms
XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) worms are a type of malicious script that can propagate through web applications, exploiting vulnerabilities in user input sanitization. One well-known example is the Samy worm, but more recent instances, such as the StalkDaily worm, which affected Twitter on April 11, 2009, have also been significant.

### Example of an XSS Worm
Consider the following code snippet:
```javascript
var xss = encodeURIComponent('http://www.stalkdaily.com">'); 
document.write("<a href='" + xss + "'>Click me</a>");
```
This script injects a malicious URL into a webpage, potentially leading to the spread of the worm.

## Potential Future Threats
The evolution of XSS worms could lead to more severe and widespread issues:
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility:** Worms that can infect users across all major browsers.
- **Site/Flaw Independence:** Worms that do not rely on specific vulnerabilities or sites.
- **Intelligent/Hybrid/Super Worms:** More sophisticated worms that can adapt and learn, as proposed by PDP and B. Hoffman.
- **DDoS Attacks:** Using infected machines to launch Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.

## Web 2.0 and New Vulnerabilities

### Feed Aggregators
Feed aggregators, which compile data from various untrusted sources, can be exploited to deliver malicious content. This can lead to feed injections, where attackers insert malicious scripts into the aggregated data.

#### Example: Ninja News
```xml
<rss version="2.0">
  <channel>
    <title>News for the discerning ninja</title>
    <link>http://examplesite.com</link>
    <description>Latest news and updates</description>

```

### Remote and Local Zone Risks
- **Remote Zone Risks:** Web browsers and web-based readers are susceptible to attacks like XSS and CSRF.
- **Local Zone Risks:** If a feed is written to a local HTML file, vulnerabilities can allow reading from the file system, leading to potential data theft.

#### Example: Yassr 0.2.2 Vulnerability
- **Issue:** GUI.pm failed to sanitize URLs correctly.
- **Exploit:** Malicious URL used in `exec()` to launch a browser and execute arbitrary code.

### Mashups and Widgets
Mashups and widgets, core components of Web 2.0, can be exploited through XSS and CSRF attacks. The rich functionality they provide can be a double-edged sword if not properly secured.

#### Examples:
- **Mashup Site Trust:** Users must trust the mashup site, which acts as a middleman.
- **Widget Security:** Widgets developed and uploaded by anyone can introduce vulnerabilities, such as function hijacking and data theft.

### Information Leakage
Information leakage occurs when applications unintentionally reveal sensitive information due to poor error handling or other security flaws.

#### Example: Error Handling
```plaintext
Microsoft OLE DB Provider for ODBC Drivers(0x80040E14)
[Microsoft][ODBC SQL Server Driver][SQL Server]Invalid column name
/examplesite/login.asp, line 10
```
Adding a parameter to the URL can exploit this:
```plaintext
http://www.examplesite.com/home.html?day=Monday AND userscolumn=2
```

### Authentication and Authorization Flaws
These flaws can lead to account hijacking, privilege escalation, and privacy violations. Common issues include weak password policies, lack of brute force protection, and predictable session IDs.

#### Example: Facebook Album Security Bypass
- **Vulnerability:** Predictable URLs for picture album access.
- **Exploit:** Manipulating parameters to gain unauthorized access.
- **Credit:** David Rook for discovering this issue.

### Insecure Storage and Communications
Insecure storage and communications can lead to data breaches. Issues include not encrypting sensitive data, hard-coding keys, and failing to use strong encryption mechanisms.

#### Example: Emailing Clear Text Passwords
- **Issue:** Sending passwords in clear text via email.
- **Solution:** Use secure communication channels and encryption.

### Preventing Vulnerabilities
To prevent these vulnerabilities, follow a set of secure development principles:
- **Input Validation:** Protect against XSS and injection attacks.
- **Output Validation:** Ensure proper encoding and sanitization.
- **Error Handling:** Prevent information leakage.
- **Authentication and Authorization:** Implement strong access controls.
- **Session Management:** Use strong session IDs and timeouts.
- **Secure Communications:** Encrypt sensitive data in transit.
- **Secure Storage:** Protect stored data with strong encryption.
- **Secure Resource Access:** Restrict access to sensitive resources.

### Secure Development Lifecycle
1. **Requirements:** Define security requirements.
2. **Design:** Create a threat model and design to eliminate threats.
3. **Code:** Build security into the code.
4. **Review:** Conduct code reviews for security flaws.
5. **Testing:** Perform manual and automated security tests.
6. **Deployment:** Deploy securely and monitor for vulnerabilities.
