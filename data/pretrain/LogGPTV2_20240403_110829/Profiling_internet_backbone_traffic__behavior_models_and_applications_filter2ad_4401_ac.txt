the two ends, 0 and 1. Similar observations also hold for
dstIP, srcPrt and dstPrt clusters extracted on these links.
As a convenient way to group together clusters of similar
behaviors, we divide each RU dimension into three cate-
gories (assigned with a label): 0 (low), 1 (medium) and 2
(high), using the following criteria:
0(low),
1(medium),
2(high),
8>:
L(ru) =
if 0 ≤ ru ≤ ,
if   0}|, and Ui be the number of unique
clusters belonging to BCi over the entire observation pe-
riod. Then the popularity of BCi is deﬁned as Πi = Oi/T ;
T
j=1 Cij/Oi; and its (membership)
its average size Σi = 
T
j=1 Cij = Ui/(ΠiOi). If a BC contains
volatility Ψi = Ui/
the same clusters in all time slots, i.e., Ui = Cij, for every
j such that Cij > 0, then Ψi = 0. In general, the closer Ψi
is to 0, the less volatile the BC is. Note that the member-
ship volatility metric is deﬁned only for BC’s with relatively
high frequency, e.g., Π > 0.2, as otherwise it contains too
few “samples” to be meaningful.
In Figs. 4(a), (b) and (c) we plot Πi, Σi and Ψi of the
srcIP BC’s for the srcIP clusters extracted using link L1
over a 24-hour period, where each time slot is a 5-minute
interval (i.e., T = 288). From Fig. 4(a) we see that 7 BC’s,
BC2 [0,0,2], BC6 [0,2,0], BC7 [0,2,1], BC8 [0,2,2], BC18
[2,0,0], BC19 [2,0,1] and BC20 [2,0,2], are most popular, oc-
curring more than half of the time; while BC11 [2,0,2] and
BC12 [2,1,0] and BC24 [2,2,1] have moderate popularity, oc-
curring about one-third of the time. The remaining BC’s
are either rare or not observed at all. Fig. 4(b) shows that

Figure 3: The distribution of relative uncertainty on free dimensions for srcIP clusters from L2,3,4,5 during a 1-hour period.
the ﬁve popular BC’s, BC2, BC6, BC7, BC18, and BC20,
have the largest (average) size, each having around 10 or
more clusters; while the other two popular BC’s, BC8 and
BC19, have four or fewer BC’s on the average. The less
popular BC’s are all small, having at most one or two clus-
ters on the average when they are observed. From Fig. 4(c),
we see that the two popular BC2 and BC20 (and the less
popular BC11, BC12 and BC24) are most volatile, while the
other ﬁve popular BC’s, BC6, BC7, BC8, BC18 and BC19
are much less volatile. To better illustrate the diﬀerence in
the membership volatility of the 7 popular BC’s, in Fig. 4(d)
we plot Ui as a function of time, i.e., Ui(t) is the total num-
ber of unique clusters belonging to BCi up to time slot t. We
see that for BC2 and BC20, new clusters show up in nearly
every time slot, while for BC7, BC8 and BC19, the same
clusters re-appear again and again. For BC6 and BC18,
new clusters show up gradually over time and they tend to
re-occur, as evidenced by the tapering oﬀ of the curves and
the large average size of these two BC’s.
4.3 Behavior Dynamics of Individual Clusters
We now investigate the behavior characteristics of indi-
vidual clusters over time. In particular, we are interested in
understanding i) the relation between the frequency of a clus-
ter (i.e., how often it is observed) and the behavior class(es)
it appears in; and ii) the behavior stability of a cluster if it
appears multiple times, namely, whether a cluster tends to
re-appear in the same BC or diﬀerent BC’s?
We use the set of srcIP clusters extracted on links with
the longest duration, L1 and L2, over a 24-hour period as
two representative examples to illustrate our ﬁndings. Fig.5
shows the frequency distribution of clusters in log-log scale,
where the x-axis is the cluster id ordered based on its fre-
quency (the most frequent cluster ﬁrst). The distribution is
“heavy-tailed”: for example more than 90.3% (and 89.6%)
clusters in L1 (and L2) occur fewer than 10 times, of which
47.1% (and 55.5%) occur only once; 0.6% (and 1.2%) oc-
cur more than 100 times. Moreover, the most frequent
clusters all fall into the ﬁve popular but non-volatile BC’s,
BC6, BC7, BC8, BC18 and BC19, while a predominant ma-
jority of the least frequent clusters belong to BC2 and BC20.
The medium-frequency clusters belong to a variety of BCs,
with BC2 and BC20 again dominant.
