User: I need help understanding what the advantage of using an asynch framework is. Suppose I want to develop a simple chat web app. Why cant I write python code in the Django framework that does long polling where I dont send a response back the server until someone enters a new msg. What does Twisted provide that gives it an advantage for real-time apps like the chat app?
Sorry I am obviously little confused about the need for an asynchronous framework.
Assistant: The biggest advantage for me is that Twisted gives me an application that has state, and can communicate with many different clients using many protocols.
For me, my Twisted server communicates with a number of sensors installed in houses and businesses that monitor power usage. It stores the data and keeps recent data and state in handy-dandy python classes in memory. Requests via xmlrpc from django get this state and can present recent data to the user. My Gridspy stuff is still in development so the actual site at your.gridspy.co.nz is a bit pre-alpha.
The best part is that you need surprisingly little code to make an effective server. An amazing amount of the work is done for you.
