User: How to deploy a highly available database? Please provide a plan, including data backup and recovery, data synchronization and disaster recovery, etc.
Assistant: To deploy a highly available database, the following aspects need to be considered: 1. Data backup and recovery plan: Regularly perform data backup and store the backup in different places to prevent single point of failure. Backups can use physical backups or logical backups. Physical backup: copy the database file system level backup to disk or cloud storage. Logical backup: back up the data logical structure and data content of the database, and the backup format is generally sql script. 2. Data synchronization scheme: Data synchronization is performed between the master node and the backup node. When the master node fails, the backup node can automatically take over the work of the master node to ensure high availability of data. Synchronization mode: asynchronous replication and synchronous replication. Asynchronous replication: After the master node writes data, it does not wait for the response of the standby node, and continues to write the next time, and asynchronously replicates to the standby node in the background. Synchronous replication: After the primary node writes data, it needs to wait for the response from the standby node to ensure that the data can be received by the standby node in time. 3. Disaster recovery plan: Deploy the master and backup nodes in different geographical locations to ensure that when the master node fails, the backup node can quickly take over the work of the master node. Disaster recovery methods: off-site disaster recovery and intra-city disaster recovery. Remote disaster recovery: The master node and standby node are deployed in different geographical locations. Intra-city disaster recovery: The master node and backup node are located in the same geographical location, but in different computer rooms or data centers. Generally speaking, deploying a highly available database needs to consider many factors, including backup and recovery, data synchronization and disaster recovery, etc., which need to be designed and implemented with comprehensive consideration.
