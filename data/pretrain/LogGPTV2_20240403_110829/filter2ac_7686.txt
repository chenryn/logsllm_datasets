### Title: Black Hat US-18: Deep Dive into an ICS Firewall, Looking for the Fire Hole

**Abstract:**

Over the past few years, the security of Industrial Control Systems (ICS) has emerged as a significant concern. Real-world attacks on ICS systems have underscored the need for robust security measures. Many critical systems cannot be taken offline for security updates, making the protection of these highly sensitive assets a formidable challenge.

As the ICS security market continues to grow, specialized firewalls have been developed to address this issue by inspecting and filtering industrial control protocols. However, the effectiveness and uniqueness of these solutions compared to standard network firewalls remain in question. What are their attack surfaces, and what types of vulnerabilities might they harbor?

In this presentation, we will delve into the Tofino Xenon firewall to answer these questions. We will outline our methodology for reverse-engineering equipment that uses a custom, encrypted administration protocol and has fully encrypted firmware. Our process will cover everything from reverse-engineering a rich client to gaining root shell access to the appliance.

We will then explore the internal workings of the firewall, including its attack surface and the security features it provides to protect vulnerable ICS equipment. Finally, we will present the vulnerabilities we discovered (CVE-2017-11400, CVE-2017-11401, and CVE-2017-11402), their potential impact, and the attack scenarios that could exploit them.

This deep dive aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the security landscape for ICS firewalls and highlight the importance of rigorous testing and continuous improvement in this critical domain.
