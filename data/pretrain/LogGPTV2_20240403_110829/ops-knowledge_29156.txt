User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Sometimes PowerShell stops sending output until I press enter. Why? Periodically I notice PowerShell seems to take forever to finish doing whatever it is I told it to do until it occurs to me to "wake it up" by pressing enter. This is not the fault of any one process as best I can tell, as I have even run custom apps that just log their output to the screen every few seconds and even in these cases, PowerShell will stop doing anything after a while until I "give it a kick" by pressing enter.

Any ideas what might be causing this?

Assistant: If the QuickEdit Mode and\or Insert options are checked within the console\window properties, and you click within the console, it will pause the output. If those options are not checked, the output can't be paused by clicking within the console.


To get to these settings, right-click on the PowerShell-Logo in the top-left of your terminal window, then select 'Properties' (at least that's one way to do it)
