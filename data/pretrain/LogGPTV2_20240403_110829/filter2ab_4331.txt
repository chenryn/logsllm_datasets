**ATT&CK ID:** T1619  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Cloud Storage Object Discovery

Adversaries may enumerate objects within cloud storage infrastructure. This enumeration can provide valuable information that adversaries can use to shape their subsequent actions, such as requesting all or specific objects from the cloud storage. This technique is analogous to File and Directory Discovery on a local host. After identifying available cloud storage services (as part of Cloud Infrastructure Discovery), adversaries may then access the contents or objects stored in the cloud infrastructure.

### Key Points:
- **Objective:** Enumerate objects in cloud storage.
- **Purpose:** Shape follow-on behaviors, such as accessing specific or all objects.
- **Comparison:** Similar to File and Directory Discovery on a local host.
- **Prerequisite:** Identification of available cloud storage services (Cloud Infrastructure Discovery).

By enumerating cloud storage objects, adversaries gain insights into the structure and content of the cloud environment, which can be leveraged for further malicious activities.
