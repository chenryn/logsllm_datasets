### Primary Goal of the Pilot Studies

The primary goal of the four pilot studies is to examine different levels of priming. We used Bankofamerica.com as an example:

- **Low Priming Level**: Participants were shown a screenshot and asked, "Is this the real bankofamerica.com?" The aim was to avoid priming users to focus on the address bar.
- **Medium Priming Level**: Participants were asked, "Is the domain name in the browser address bar bankofamerica.com?" By explicitly mentioning the address bar, we cued users to examine it.
- **High Priming Level**: Participants' attention was drawn even more to the domain name by directly including a homograph domain name in the question. For instance, "Is bankofamerl,ca.com the same as bankofamerica.com?" This essentially asked users to compare the two domain names side-by-side.

We also tested two different designs for the answer options:
1. **Binary Answers**: Participants could choose from "Yes," "No," or "I can't tell."
2. **5-Point Likert Scale**: Participants rated their confidence on a scale.

### Feedback from Participants

After the study, several participants thanked us for educating them about homograph IDNs.

### Screenshot Design

In the address bar of the screenshots, we always displayed the Unicode version of the homograph IDNs to examine how users perceive them and to fairly compare homograph IDNs missed by Chrome with those that were blocked. We aimed to understand whether the missed IDNs are more or less difficult to detect by users compared to the blocked ones in the Unicode format.

**Figure 3: Example Screenshot**
- The screenshot always shows the real webpage.
- The address bar was artificially added to display either the real domain name or a homograph IDN in Unicode (e.g., www.bankofamerl,ca.com).
- Below the screenshot, we asked, "Is the domain name in the browser address bar bankofamerica.com?"
- Participants could choose one of three answers: "Yes," "No," "I can't tell."

### Final Design

After comparing the results of the pilot studies, we decided to use the medium priming level and binary answer (plus "I can’t tell") for the final design. The question was, "Is the domain name in the browser address bar [the real domain name]?" Participants could choose from "Yes," "No," or "I can’t tell." This decision was based on two reasons:
1. **Simplicity and Clarity**: A 5-point Likert scale did not provide additional insights and could complicate the task. A binary answer (plus "I can’t tell") reduces ambiguity.
2. **Suitability**: The medium priming level (mildly cuing users to check the address bar) is more appropriate since our research questions focus on domain names. Pilot studies showed higher accuracy in labeling domain authenticity under a higher priming level (see Appendix-A).

### Main User Study

#### Setups

- **Websites**: We used a diverse set of 90 websites, 45 from the Chromium top domain list (popular) and 45 not on the list (unpopular). These websites were selected from five common categories: "Shopping," "Banking," "Social Networking," "Education," and "Government & Military" (18 websites per category).
- **Domain Types**:
  - **Real**: Displayed the real domain name.
  - **IDN-Block**: Homograph IDNs that can be blocked by the latest Chrome.
  - **IDN-Pass**: Homograph IDNs that bypass Chrome’s policies.
- **Ratio**: Out of the 90 websites, the ratio of "Real," "IDN-Block," and "IDN-Pass" was roughly 1:1:2. We included more IDN-Pass domains because they are less understood and studied.
- **Specific Distribution**:
  - 23 websites displayed the real domain names.
  - 23 websites displayed homograph IDNs that can be blocked by Chrome.
  - 44 websites displayed homograph IDNs that bypass Chrome’s policies.

#### Factors

- **Website Category and Popularity**
- **Demographics and Experience**: Age range, gender identity, years of using web browsers, computing background, etc. (Questions available [here](https://github.com/stevetkjan/IDN_Testing/blob/master/Questions-IDN.pdf)).

#### Study Process

- **Conducted in April 2020 on MTurk**.
- **Participants Examined 30 Websites**: The 90 websites were divided into 3 blocks (each block has 30 websites). Each participant was randomly assigned to one block.
- **Attention Check Questions**: Two questions were designed to filter out non-attentive participants.
- **Participant Filters**: U.S. workers with an approval rate >90% and >50 approved tasks. Compensation: $1 per participant, taking 8 minutes on average ($8/hour).

#### Results

- **Correct Answer Rates**:
  - Real: 94.6%
  - IDN-Block: 48.5%
  - IDN-Pass: 55.2%

- **CDF of Labeling Accuracy**: All participants had an accuracy above 20%, with 15% achieving 100% accuracy. About half had an accuracy below 60%.

- **Statistical Significance**: Pair-wise comparisons using Chi-square tests with Bonferroni correction (adjusted p-value threshold = 0.01) showed significant differences among the conditions.

#### Regression Analysis

- **Logistic Regression** to predict whether the authenticity of a website domain name was correctly labeled.
- **Predictor Variables**:
  - **Domain Type**: Real, IDN-Pass, IDN-Block (baseline).
  - **Website Category and Popularity**.
  - **User Factors**: Web browsing experience, computing background, gender, age, education level.

- **Results**:
  - **Domain Type**: Participants were significantly more likely to label real and IDN-Pass domains correctly compared to IDN-Block.
  - **User Factors**: Longer web browsing experience, male participants, older participants, and higher education levels were positively correlated with better performance.
  - **Website Category and Popularity**: Not significantly associated with user performance.

### Conclusion

The results suggest that the majority of users struggle to correctly identify homograph IDNs, especially those that bypass Chrome’s policies. Several user factors, such as experience and demographics, were significantly associated with better performance in detecting these deceptive domain names.
