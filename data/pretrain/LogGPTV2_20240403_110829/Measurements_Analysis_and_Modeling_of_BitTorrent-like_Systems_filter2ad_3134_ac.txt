idea of the ﬂuid model, but using the evolution of peer
arrival rate described in Equation 3.1. The basic ODE
(ordinary differential equation) set for the ﬂuid model is
dx(t)
dt
dy(t)
dt
= λ0e− t
τ − µ(ηx(t) + y(t)),
= µ(ηx(t) + y(t)) − γy(t),
(3.7)
x(0) = 0, y(0) = 1,
where the meanings of the parameters in our ﬂuid model
are listed in Table 1. These notations are adopted from
work [18, 23].
When the ODE set has two different real eigenvalues
ψ1 6= ψ2, the resolution can be expressed as:
(cid:26) x(t) = aeψ1t + beψ2t + d1e− t
τ ,
y(t) = c1aeψ1t + c2beψ2t + d2e− t
τ ,
(3.8)
where d1, d2, c1, c2, a, b are constant. The value of these
constants and the detailed resolution of the ﬂuid model
can be found in our technical report [13].
The average downloading speed of peers at time t is
u(t) = µ
ηx(t) + y(t)
x(t)
= µ(η +
y(t)
x(t)
).

We use the tracker trace to validate the torrent evolu-
tion model. Similar to the peer arrival rate, the modeling
results ﬁt the trace better for torrents with larger popula-
tions. Figure 7(a) shows the torrent evolution by both our
ﬂuid model and the analysis results of a typical torrent in
the trace. The ﬁgure shows that the number of down-
loaders increases exponentially in a short period of time
after the torrent’s birth (the ﬂash crowd period), and then
decreases exponentially, but at a slower rate. The num-
ber of seeds also increases exponentially at ﬁrst, and then
decreases exponentially at a slower rate. The peak time
of the number of seeds lags behind that of the number
of downloaders. As a result, u(t) increases until the tor-
rent is dead, and the resources of seeds cannot increase
in proportion to service demand. Furthermore, due to the
random arrival of downloaders and the random depar-
ture of seeds, average downloading performance ﬂuctu-
ates signiﬁcantly when the number of peers in the torrent
is small, as shown in Figure 7(b).
Figure 8(a) shows the performance variations of the
torrent under two kinds of granularities. The instant
speed represents the mean downloading speed of all
peers in the torrent at that time instant, sampled every
half an hour. The average speed represents the average
value of the instant speed over the typical downloading
time (the average downloading time of all peers). The
ﬁgure shows that the client downloading speed at dif-
ferent time stages is highly diverse and can affect client
downloading time signiﬁcantly. The reason is that seeds
play an important role in the client downloading perfor-
mance. However, the generation of seeds is the same
as the completeness of peer downloading, so the random
ﬂuctuation of downloading speed cannot be smoothed in

the scale of typical downloading time when the number
of peers is small.
Figure 8(b) shows the number of downloaders and
seeds (a stack ﬁgure), and the average downloading
speed for each torrent in the trace at 12:00:01 on 2003-
11-15.
In this ﬁgure, each point in x-axis denotes a
torrent, while the left y-axis denotes the number of
downloaders and seeds in this torrent (stacked), and the
right y-axis denotes average downloading speed of this
torrent. The torrents in the x-axis are sorted in non-
ascending order of the number of downloaders and seeds
of torrents. The results at other time instants are similar.
In general, peers in torrents with larger population have
relatively higher and more stable downloading speed,
while the downloading speed in torrents with small popu-
lations disperses signiﬁcantly. When the number of peers
in the torrent is small, the client downloading perfor-
mance is easily affected by the individual behavior of
seeds.
Figure 8(c) shows the total number of peers in all tor-
rents (a stack ﬁgure) and the average downloading speed
of all downloaders in the trace at different time stages.
The average downloading speed of all torrents is shown
to be much more stable than that of one torrent. The rea-
son is that the downloader/seed ratio is much more stable
due to the large population of the system. This motivates
us to balance the service load among different torrents,
so that each torrent can provide relatively stable down-
loading performance to clients in its lifespan.
3.4 Service Fairness Study in BitTorrent
In a BitTorrent system, the service policy of seeds favors
peers with high downloading speed, in order to improve
the seed production rate in the system, i.e., to have these
high speed downloaders complete downloading as soon
as possible and wish they will then serve other download-
ers. In this subsection, we investigate whether this wish
comes true in practice.
We deﬁne the contribution ratio of a peer as the to-
tal uploaded bytes over the total downloaded bytes of the
peer. Figure 9(a) shows the peer downloading speed and
the corresponding contribution ratio extracted from the
trace. In this ﬁgure, each point in the x-axis denotes a

tribute. This indicates that peers with high speed ﬁn-
