#### Introduction
- Basic introduction with in-depth analysis
- No affiliation with major companies or cryptocurrencies

#### Why Was Bitcoin Created?
- High fees associated with current e-payment solutions
- Centralized control by entities like PayPal
- Rise of decentralized digital technologies, such as torrents

#### What is Bitcoin and Who Made It?
- A decentralized peer-to-peer currency
- No central authority
- Transactions verified by network participants
- Total value exceeds $100,000,000 USD
- "Money" generated through GPU mining
- Developed by the enigmatic Satoshi Nakamoto, who left the project in 2010

#### The Economics of Bitcoin
- **Fiat Currency Comparison**: Bitcoin functions similarly to fiat currencies like the USD.
- **Deflationary Nature**: Maximum supply capped at 21,000,000 BTC.
- **Divisibility**: Can be traded down to 0.00000001 BTC.
- **Generation and Backing**: Generated by GPUs (or ASICs), backed by the marginal utility of a semi-anonymous virtual currency.
- **Not a Ponzi Scheme**: Early adopters benefited, but it is not a traditional Ponzi scheme.
- **Price Volatility**: Price increased over 200,000% due to media coverage and the novelty of the currency type.
- **Equilibrium Price**: Likely to stabilize due to various market factors.

**Price Chart:**
- From $0.06 to $30 in a few months (logarithmic scale).
- Early adopters made significant profits.

#### SHA-256, the Blockchain, and GPUs
- **Algorithm**: Bitcoin uses the SHA-256 algorithm.
- **GPU Efficiency**: GPUs are hundreds of times faster than CPUs for mining.
- **Blockchain**: Every transaction is hashed and becomes part of the blockchain.
- **Wallet Storage**: Coins are stored in a `wallet.dat` file.
- **Network Power**: The entire Bitcoin network is more powerful than projects like Folding@home or the RIKEN supercomputer.
- **Mining Pools**: Mining is often pooled, and top pool operators can become wealthy from fees.

#### Attack Vectors: Botnets and Bitcoin
- **Network Overload**: Attacks involve overwhelming the network with illegitimate clients or high hashing power.
- **Blockchain Forking**: Controlling over 50% of the network's hashing power allows for forking the blockchain.
- **Cancer Nodes**: Refusing to relay blocks and process transactions, enabling double-spending and network stoppage.
- **Financial Incentives**: Half of the hashing power could represent over $120,000 per day for an attacker.
- **Rule-Abiding Botnets**: Botnets that follow the rules could represent a significant portion of today's hashing power without detection.

#### Timejacking and DoS
- **Timejacking**: Requires a small botnet to manipulate a node's clock.
- **DoS Mitigation**: Bitcoin drops connections to peers sending too much data, making DoS attacks harder.
- **Botnet Detection**: No way to distinguish between a rule-abiding botnet and legitimate users.

#### Wallet Security
- **User Vulnerability**: Not all users are security experts.
- **Unencrypted Wallets**: `wallet.dat` files are unencrypted.
- **Trojan Horses**: Specialized malware targets Windows users.
- **Security Best Practices**: See [en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Securing_your_wallet](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Securing_your_wallet).

#### Third-Party Attacks
- **Currency Exchanges and Gift Card Services**: Fertile ground for attacks.
- **Mt. Gox**: Compromised, leading to a $9 million attempted sell-off and a trading freeze.
- **Deepbit.net**: Unspecified amount stolen when payout addresses were changed.
- **Security Awareness**: Many Bitcoin-related sites lack the security measures of established banks.

#### User Gullibility
- **Scams and Frauds**: Bitcoin 419 scams, fake gift card payouts, investment sites, and currency exchanges.
- **Human Factor**: There is no patch for human stupidity; gullible users are easily parted from their bitcoins.

#### High-Frequency Trading
- **Market Manipulation**: High-frequency trading based on minor market fluctuations.
- **Market Power**: High rollers can move the market and execute trades with good results.
- **Third-Party Execution**: High-frequency trading is slow on the Bitcoin network and is usually carried out through third parties.

#### The Finney Attack
- **Zero-Confirmation Transactions**: Accepting unconfirmed transactions creates vulnerabilities.
- **Attack Mechanism**: Attacker sends coins to themselves in an unbroadcasted block, then spends them, overriding the original transaction.

#### Illicit Activities
- **Silk Road Marketplace**: Trades in illegal goods, relying on Bitcoin's anonymity for plausible deniability.
- **Money Laundering**: Trivial with Bitcoin, again relying on the supposed anonymity of the network.
- **Media Attention**: These activities attract negative press.

#### Anonymity Concerns
- **Public Information**: Addresses and their associated bitcoins are public.
- **Identity Ties**: If addresses can be linked to individuals, anonymity is compromised.
- **Network Monitoring**: High-level monitoring can identify many Bitcoin users.
- **eWallet Providers**: Offer some anonymity but introduce third-party risks.

#### ASICs: The Dark Horse
- **Energy Efficiency**: A few watts per chip compared to 100+ for a GPU.
- **High Development Costs**: Significant upfront investment required.
- **Hashing Capability**: Potential to create substantial network-scale hashing power.
- **Current Deployment**: Already in use in some mining operations.
- **Secretive Influence**: May already represent a significant portion of the network's hashing power.

#### GPU Market Impact
- **Global Shortages**: AMD Radeon HD 5000 series GPUs are in short supply.
- **Resale Prices**: Used GPUs sell for up to 150% of retail on platforms like eBay and Craigslist.
- **Hoarding and Mining**: Individuals hoard GPUs for resale or mining.
- **Rapid Sellouts**: Newegg restocks sell out within minutes.
- **Competitive Performance**: Radeon HD 6000 and Nvidia GPUs are less efficient for Bitcoin mining.
- **Future Models**: Radeon HD 7000 series specs suggest comparable performance to the 5000 series.

#### Miscellaneous
- **Law Enforcement Misunderstandings**: High power bills led to a fruitless raid on a suspected weed growing operation.
- **Humor and Criticism**: Websites like buttcoin.org and bitcoinminingaccidents.com highlight flaws and incidents.

#### Conclusion
- **Questions?**
