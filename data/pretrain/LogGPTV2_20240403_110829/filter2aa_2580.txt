WHY was Bitcoin created?
● High fees with current e-payment solutions
● Paypal (and others) playing big brother
● Increase in decentralized digital technologies, eg torrents
WHAT is Bitcoin and WHO made it?
● A decentralized Peer-to-Peer currency
● No central authority
● Transactions verified by peers
● Over $100,000,000 US in value
● “Money” printed by GPUs
● Enigmatic developer Satoshi Nakamoto who left in 2010
The Economics of Bitcoin
Hackers? In my Economy? It's more likely than you think!
● Bitcoin is Fiat currency, just like USD
● It has built in deflation, never more than 21,000,000 BTC
● Can be traded down to 0.00000001BTC
● Generated by GPUs (or ASICs?), backed by the marginal 
utility of a Semi-Anonymous virtual currency
● Not a Ponzi Scheme, but the early adopters got rich
● Price up over 200,000%, rampant speculation due to    
media coverage and novelty of currency type
● Will likely find an equilibrium price due to many factors
A chart is fine too...
● $0.06 to $30 in a few months, this scale is logarithmic!
● Who made big bucks?
SHA-256, the block chain and GPUs
● Bitcoin algorithm based on SHA-256
● GPUs are hundreds of times faster than CPUs
● Every transaction is hashed and becomes part of the       
“block chain”
● Coins stored in a wallet.dat file
● The entire network is many times more powerful than 
folding@home or the RIEKN supercomputer
● Mining pooled to a large degree, fees are making top pool 
operators rich
Attack Vector: Botnets and Bitcoin
● These attacks rely on overwhelming the network with        
illegitimate clients or a lot of hashing power
● Forking the block chain if you control over 50% of the net-
work hashing power
● “Cancer nodes” refusing to relay blocks and process trans-
actions, allowing double-spending and network stoppage
● Half of the hashing power would represent over $120,000 
per day for the attacker, making an attack attractive
● A botnet for financial gain that doesn't harm the network 
could be running today
● A supermassive botnet can create total market-power
Attack Vector: Botnets and Bitcoin
● “Timejacking” a node requires a fairly small botnet
● Bitcoin will drop a connection to a peer sending too much data, 
making DoS a bit harder, at least requiring more nodes.
● No way to tell the difference between a botnet that “plays by the 
rules” and a bunch of legitimate users
● The most lucrative use of a botnet in the long term may not be 
attacking the network, but contributing to it
● “Rule abiding” botnets could represent a significant fraction of 
today's hashing power and we wouldn't know
Attack Vector: Pickpocketing wallet.dat
● Not all users are level 31337 computer scientists
● wallet.dat is unencrypted
● Many daytraders and speculators, a few dimwits
● Specialized Trojan Horses target Windows
● Limewire. Wait, Limewire!?
● Don't put all your eggs in one unprotected basket, just ask 
“Allinvain” who lost $500,000 in a single wallet.dat file
● See en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Securing_your_wallet
Attack Vector: Third Parties
● Third-parties such as currency exchanges and giftcard services 
provide fertile attack ground, each attack would be site specific
● Mt. Gox 0wned, had old unsalted password hashes, $9 million 
attempted sell off of compromised accounts crashed market, 
forced a freeze on trading for almost a week
● Deepbit.net 0wned, unspecified amount taken when payout 
addresses changed, cost eaten by site admin
● Many bitcoin related sites don't yet take as security-conscious a 
view as established banks
Attack Vector: The Gullible Users
● Bitcoin 419 Scams
● Fake Giftcard payouts
● Fake investment sites
● Fake currency exchanges
● “I'm a Nigerian Prince who has won 89 Million Bitcoins and I just 
need you to pay my Bitcoin transfer fee so you can claim 10%”
● There is no patch for human stupidity, a fool and their bitcoins 
are soon parted
Attack Vector: High Frequency Trading
● Constant computerized trading of a financial holding based 
miniscule market fluctuations with the intent to turn a small 
profit thousands of times
● “High rollers” can assert partial market power, execute high 
frequency trading with good results by single handedly moving 
the market
● High Frequency Trading is quite slow on the actual Bitcoin 
network, would be carried out through third parties
Attack Vector: The “Finney” Attack
● Accepting a 0-confirmation transaction creates the problem
● Attacker sends coins to himself in an unbroadcasted block, 
“spends” coins, the coins sent to the attacker's own address 
take precedence
● The problem with a bitcoin vending machine
Drugs, Weapons and Money Laundering
Oh, so that's where the bad press is from?
● Silkroad marketplace trades in (mostly) illegal wares, relies on 
the supposed anonymity of Bitcoin for plausible deniability of 
financial transfers proceeding shipment
● Money laundering is trivial with Bitcoin, again relying on the 
supposed anonymity of the network
● Represents a nice shiny object for the media to peck at
P.W.N.T. by a L.E.A.: So maybe Bitcoin isn't so 
anonymous after all... 
● It is public information what address has what bitcoins, and 
from who they were received
● If you can tie a few addresses to a few people, and people use 
only one address, anonymity is out the window
● High level network monitoring can possibly identify many bitcoin 
users
● eWallet providers are somewhat of a solution, but introduce 
third party issues
ASICs: The Darkhorse
● A few watts per chip, versus 100+ for a GPU
● Very high upfront development costs and effort
● Possibility to create network-scale hashing capability with 
millions in investment
● Already deployed in at least one mining operation
● May already represent a substantial portion of network hashing 
power in relative secrecy
I accidentally the GPU market...
● Global shortages of AMD Radeon HD 5000 series GPUs
● Best price/performance GPUs selling used for upwards of 150% 
retail on ebay, craigslist, etc
● Individual buyers hoarding dozens of GPUs for resale or mining
● Sellouts within minutes of restocking on Newegg
● Radeon HD 6000 series and Nvidia are lower performing
● Radeon HD 7000 series leaked specs reveal rough 
comparability with 5000 series for bitcoin mining
Miscellaneous
● “But I'm growing currency, officer” - high power bill leads to 
fruitless raid of suspected weed growing operation
● buttcoin.org, humorously pointing out flaws in Bitcoin
● bitcoinminingaccidents.com, heat stroke case
