### Bug report
**Bug summary**
When using both `title` and `suptitle` with `constrained_layout`, titles
overlap.
**Code for reproduction**
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    plt.rcParams = plt.rcParamsDefault
    plt.rcParams['figure.constrained_layout.use'] = True
    plt.title('Test with b')
    plt.suptitle('Test with p')
Other possibility is the exact demonstration that is used to work by @jklymak
here, hence the “Regression?” tag in the title. I don’t have time to bisect
currently though…
**Actual outcome**
test.pdf
**Expected outcome**
Titles are spaced correctly.
**Matplotlib version**
  * Operating system: ArchLinux
  * Matplotlib version: 3.1rc2
  * Matplotlib backend (`print(matplotlib.get_backend())`): multiple
  * Python version: 3.7.3
Python and matplotlib are distro packages.
