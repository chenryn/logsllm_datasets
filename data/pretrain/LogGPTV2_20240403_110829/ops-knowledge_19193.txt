User: I know there are multiple solutions online, but some are for windows, some are environmental variable, etc..
What is the best way?
Assistant: I personally just define PYTHONPATH in ~/.bashrc, as for what's the "best" approach? I think that's hard to answer (or rather, there's no correct answer). It depends.
