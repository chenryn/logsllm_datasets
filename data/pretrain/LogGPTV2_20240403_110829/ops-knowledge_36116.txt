User: Use Ansible automation tool to deploy a web server environment, including Apache, PHP and MySQL.
Assistant: Following are the steps to deploy a web server environment using Ansible automation tool. 1. Install Ansible First, you need to install Ansible. Ansible can be installed on a Linux system using a package manager such as apt, yum, or dnf. On Ubuntu and Debian systems, use the following command to install Ansible: ``` sudo apt update sudo apt install ansible ``` On CentOS and Fedora systems, use the following command to install Ansible: ``` sudo dnf install ansible # Fedora sudo yum install ansible # CentOS ``` Or use pip to install Ansible: ``` sudo pip install ansible ``` 2. Install Apache, PHP, and MySQL Use Ansible's package module to install Apache, PHP, and MySQL packages. Add the following tasks to the Ansible playbook: ``` - name: Install Apache web server package: name: httpd state: installed - name: Install PHP and related packages package: name: - php - php-mysql state: installed - name: Install MySQL database server package: name: mysql-server state: installed ``` 3. Configure the Apache service After the installation is complete, you need to configure the Apache service. Create a new configuration file to set parameters such as virtual host and document root. Add the following tasks to the Ansible playbook: ``` - name: Create Apache configuration file template: src: apache.conf.j2 dest: /etc/httpd/conf.d/myapp.conf mode: '0644' notify: - restart apache - name: Create document root directory file: path: /var/www/myapp state: directory owner: apache group: apache mode: '0755' ``` Among them, apache.conf.j2 is a Jinja2 template file that contains Configuration of parameters such as Apache virtual host and document root directory. 4. Start and configure the MySQL service Start the MySQL service and set the password of the root user. Add the following tasks to the Ansible playbook: ``` - name: Start MySQL service service: name: mysqld state: started - name: Secure MySQL installation mysql_user: name: root password: "{{ mysql_root_password }}" login_unix_socket: /var/ lib/mysql/mysql.sock state: present update_password: on_create - name: Remove anonymous users mysql_user: login_user: root login_password: "{{ mysql_root_password }}" host: "{{ item }}" user: '' state: absent loop : - 'localhost' - '{{ ansible_hostname }}' when: item == 'localhost' or item == ansible_hostname - name: Remove test database mysql_db: name: test state: absent - name: Flush MySQL privileges mysql_db: name: '' state: flush_privs ``` Among them, {{ mysql_root_password }} is an Ansible variable used to set the password of the MySQL root user. 5. Restart the Apache service Finally, restart the Apache service to make the configuration take effect. Add the following tasks to the Ansible playbook: ``` - name: Restart Apache service service: name: httpd state: restarted ``` Complete Ansible playbook: ``` - name: Deploy web server environment hosts: all become: yes vars : mysql_root_password: mypassword123 tasks: - name: Install Apache web server package: name: httpd state: installed - name: Install PHP and related packages package: name: - php - php-mysql state: installed - name: Install MySQL database server package : name: mysql-server state: installed - name: Start MySQL service service: name: mysqld state: started - name: Secure MySQL installation mysql_user: name: root password: "{{ mysql_root_password }}" login_unix_socket: /var/lib/ mysql/mysql.sock state: present update_password: on_create - name: Remove anonymous users mysql_user: login_user: root login_password: "{{ mysql_root_password }}" host: "{{ item }}" user: '' state: absent loop: - 'localhost' - '{{ ansible_hostname }}' when: item == 'localhost' or item == ansible_hostname - name: Remove test database mysql_db: name: test state: absent - name: Flush MySQL privileges mysql_db: name: '' state: flush_privs - name: Create Apache configuration file template: src: apache.conf.j2 dest: /etc/httpd/conf.d/myapp.conf mode: '0644' notify: - restart apache - name: Create document root directory file: path: /var/www/myapp state: directory owner: apache group: apache mode: '0755' - name: Restart Apache service service: name: httpd state: restarted handlers: - name: restart apache service: name: httpd state: restarted ``` After running the above playbook, Apache, PHP, and MySQL will be automatically installed and related configurations will be completed.
