Answers to Domain 3 Review Questions
1. Answer: C
Explanation: In this scenario, the existing model focused on confidentiality. To round out the model and meet the
goal of preventing “write up,” you need to supplement the existing model with a model that focuses on integrity
(such as Biba). Focusing on integrity will ensure that you don’t have “write up” (or “read down” either, although that
wasn’t a requirement in this scenario).
2. Answer: D
Explanation: An injection attack provides invalid input to an application or web page. The goal is to craft that input
so that a backend interpreter either performs an action not intended by the organization (such as running
administrative commands) or crashes. Injection attacks are mature and routinely used, so it is important to be
aware of them and how to protect against them.
3. Answer: C
Explanation: When designing a PKI, keep in mind the basic security tenets — the more tiers, the more security, and
the more flexibility. Of course, having more tiers also means more cost and complexity. In this scenario, to
maximize security and flexibility, you need to use a three-tier hierarchy with the root CAs and the policy CAs being
offline. Offline CAs enhance security. Multiple tiers, especially with the use of policy CAs, enhance flexibility because
you can revoke one section of the hierarchy without impacting the other (for example, if one of the issuing CAs had
a key compromised).

Domain 4. Communication and Network
Security
Networking can be one of the most complex topics on the CISSP exam. If you are lucky enough to have a network
background, then you won’t find this domain difficult. However, if your background doesn’t have much networking, spend
extra time in this section and consider diving deep into topics that still don’t make sense after you go through this section.
4.1 Implement secure design principles in network architecture
This section addresses the design aspects of networking, focusing on security. While networking’s primary function is to
enable communication, security will ensure that the communication is between authorized devices only and the
communication is private when needed.
 Open System Interconnection (OSI) and Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) models.
The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is the more common of the two prevailing network models.
However, in the context of CISSP, you must also be aware of the TCP/IP model and how it compares to the OSI
model. The TCP/IP model uses only four layers, while the OSI model uses seven. The following table summarizes
the layers of each model.
Layer Number OSI Model TCP/IP Model
7 Application
6 Presentation Applications
5 Session
4 Transport TCP (host to host)
3 Network IP
2 Data link
Network access
1 Physical
Many people use mnemonics to memorize the OSI layers. One popular mnemonic for the OSI layers is “All People
Seem To Need Data Processing.”
 Internet Protocol (IP) networking. IP networking is what enables devices to communicate. IP provides the
foundation for other protocols to be able to communicate. IP itself is a connectionless protocol. IPv4 is for 32-bit
addresses, and IPv6 is for 128-bit addresses. Regardless of which version you use to connect devices, you then
typically use TCP or UDP to communicate over IP. TCP is a connection-oriented protocol that provides reliable
communication, while UDP is a connectionless protocol that provides best-effort communication. Both protocols
use standardized port numbers to enable applications to communicate over the IP network.
 Implications of multilayer protocols. Some protocols simultaneously use multiple layers of the OSI or TCP/IP
model to communicate, and traverse the layers at different times. The process of traversing theses layers is called
encapsulation. For example, when a Layer 2 frame is sent through an IP layer, the Layer 2 data is encapsulated into
45
a Layer 3 packet, which adds the IP-specific information. Additionally, that layer can have other TCP or UDP data
added to it for Layer 4 communication.
 Converged protocols. Like encapsulation, converged protocols enable communication over different mediums.
For example, FCoE sends typical fibre channel control commands over Ethernet. Voice over IP (VoIP) sends SIP or
other voice protocols over typical IP networks. In most cases, this provides simplicity, since the same infrastructure
can be used for multiple scenarios. However, it can also add complexity by introducing more protocols and devices
to manage and maintain on that same infrastructure.
 Software-defined networks. As networks, cloud services and multi-tenancy grow, the need to manage these
networks has changed. Many networks follow either a two-tier (spine/leaf or core/access) or a three-tier (core,
distribution, edge/access) topology. While the core network might not change that frequently, the edge or access
devices can communicate with a variety of devices types and tenants. Increasingly, the edge or access switch is a
virtual switch running on a hypervisor or virtual machine manager. You must be able to add a new subnet or VLAN
or make other network changes on demand. You must be able to make configuration changes programmatically
across multiple physical devices, as well as across the virtual switching devices in the topology. A software-defined
network enables you to make these changes for all devices types with ease.
 Wireless networks. Wireless networks can be broken into the different 802.11 standards. The most common
protocols within 802.11 are shown in the table below. Additional protocols have been proposed to IEEE, including
ad, ah, aj, ax, ay and az. You should be aware of the frequency that each protocol uses.
802.11 protocol Frequency Data stream rate
a 5 GHz Up to 54 Mbps
b 2.4 GHz Up to 11 Mbps
g 2.4 GHz Up to 54 Mbps
n 2.4–5 GHz Up to 600 Mbps
ac 5 GHz Up to 3466 Mbps
You should also be familiar with the wireless security standards:
 Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP). WEP is a legacy security algorithm for wireless networks. Originally, it
was the only encryption protocol for 802.11a and 802.11b networks. WEP used 64-bit to 256-bit keys, but
with a weak stream cipher. WEP was deprecated in 2004 in favor of WPA and WPA2. Today, WEP should be
avoided.
 Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA). WPA uses Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP) with a 128-bit per-packet
key. However, WPA is still vulnerable to password cracking from packet spoofing on a network. WPA
typically uses a pre-shared key (PSK) and Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP) for encryption. This is
known as WPA Personal (which is typically used in a home environment). There is also a WPA Enterprise
which can use certificate authentication or an authentication server (such as a RADIUS server).
 Wi-Fi Protected Access II (WPA 2). WPA2 is the current standard for wireless encryption. WPA2 is based
on the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) cipher with message authenticity and integrity checking. AES is
stronger than TKIP. Like WPA, WPA2 offers a PSK mode (for home or small business) and an enterprise
mode (known as WPA2-ENT). WPA2-ENT uses a new encryption key each time a user connects. The
46
password is not stored on the client devices (unlike PSK mode, which stores the passwords locally on
clients).
Regardless of the security method you use, you should also use TLS or IPsec for network communication. Finally,
remember that wireless networks use collision avoidance, instead of the collision detection used on wired
networks.
4.2 Secure network components
The components of a network make up the backbone of the logical infrastructure for an organization. These components
are often critical to day-to-day operations, and an outage or security issue can cause millions of dollars in business losses.
Here are issues to pay attention to:
 Operation of hardware. Modems are a type of Channel Service Unit/Data Service Unit (CSU/DSU) typically used
for converting analog signals into digital. In this scenario, the CSU handles communication to the provider network,
while the DSU handles communication with the internal digital equipment (in most cases, a router). Modems
typically operate on Layer 2 of the OSI model. Routers operate on Layer 3 of the OSI model, and make the
connection from a modem available to multiple devices in a network topology, including switches, access points
and endpoint devices. Switches are typically connected to a router to enable multiple devices to use the connection.
Switches help provide internal connectivity, as well as create separate broadcast domains when configured with
VLANs. Switches typically operate at Layer 2 of the OSI model, but many switches can operate at both Layer 2 and
Layer 3. Access points can be configured in the network topology to provide wireless access using one of the
protocols and encryption algorithms discussed in section 4.1.
 Transmission media. Wired transmission media can typically be described in three categories: coaxial, Ethernet
and fiber. Coaxial is typically used with cable modem installations to provide connectivity to an ISP, and requires a
modem to convert the analog signals to digital. While Ethernet can be used to describe many mediums, it is typically
associated with Category 5 and Category 6 unshielded twisted-pair (UTP) or shielded twisted pair (STP), and can be
plenum-rated for certain installations. Fiber typically comes in two options, single-mode or multi-mode. Singlemode is typically used for long-distance communication, over several kilometers or miles. Multi-mode fiber is
typically used for faster transmission, but with a distance limit depending on the desired speed. Fiber is most often
used in the datacenter for backend components.
 Network access control (NAC) devices. Much as you need to control physical access to equipment and wiring,
you need to use logical controls to protect a network. There are a variety of devices that provide this type of
protection, including the following:
 Stateful and stateless firewalls can perform inspection of the network packets that traverse it and use
rules, signatures and patterns to determine whether the packet should be delivered. Reasons for dropping
a packet could include addresses that don’t exist on the network, ports or addresses that are blocked, or
the content of the packet (such as malicious packets that have been blocked by administrative policy).
 Intrusion detection and prevention devices. These devices monitor the network for unusual network
traffic and MAC or IP address spoofing, and then either alert on or actively stop this type of traffic.
47
 Proxy or reverse proxy servers. Proxy servers can be used to proxy internet-bound traffic to the internet,
instead of having clients going directly to the internet. Reverse proxies are often deployed to a perimeter
network. They proxy communication from the internet to an internal server, such as a web server. Like a
firewall, a reverse proxy can have rules and policies to block certain types of communication.
 Endpoint security. The saying “a chain is only as strong as its weakest link” can also apply to your network.
Endpoint security can be the most difficult to manage and maintain, but also the most important part of securing
a network. It can include authentication on endpoint devices, multifactor authentication, volume encryption, VPN
tunnels and network encryption, remote access, anti-virus and anti-malware software, and more. Unauthorized
access to an endpoint device is one of the easiest backdoor methods into a network because the attack surface is
so large. Attackers often target endpoint devices hoping to use the compromised device as a launching spot for
lateral movement and privilege escalation. Beyond the traditional endpoint protection methods, there are others
that provide additional security:
 Application whitelisting. Only applications on the whitelist can run on the endpoint. This can minimize
the chances of malicious applications being installed or run.
 Restricting the use of removable media. In a high-security organization, you should minimize or
eliminate the use of removable media, including any removable storage devices that rely on USB or other
connection methods. This can minimize malicious files coming into the network from the outside, as well
as data leaving the company on tiny storage mechanisms.
 Automated patch management. Patch management is the most critical task for maintaining endpoints.
You must patch the operating system as well as all third-party applications. Beyond patching, staying up to
date on the latest versions can bring enhanced security.
 Content-distribution networks (CDNs). CDNs are used to distribute content globally. They are typically used for
downloading large files from a repository. The repositories are synchronized globally, and then each incoming
request for a file or service is directed to the nearest service location. For example, if a request comes from Asia, a
local repository in Asia, rather than one in the United States. would provide the file access. This reduces the latency
of the request and typically uses less bandwidth. CDNs are often more resistant to denial of service (DoS) attacks
than typical corporate networks, and they are often more resilient.
 Physical devices. Physical security is one of the most important aspects of securing a network. Most network
devices require physical access to perform a reset, which can cause configurations to be deleted and grant the
person full access to the device and an easy path to any devices attached to it. The most common methods for
physical access control are code-based or card-based access. Unique codes or cards are assigned to individuals to
identify who accessed which physical doors or locks in the secure environment. Secure building access can also
involve video cameras, security personnel, reception desks and more. In some high-security organizations, it isn’t
uncommon to physically lock computing devices to a desk. In the case of mobile devices, it is often best to have
encryption and strong security policies to reduce the impact of stolen devices because physically protecting them
is difficult.
