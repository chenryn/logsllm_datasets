location of the related control station.
According to the RemoteID specification, UAVs must periodically
broadcast messages containing at least the following information.
• A unique identifier of the identity of the drone.
• An indication of the drone’s current location, expressed in
terms of latitude, longitude, geometric altitude, and speed.
• The indication of the current location of the control station
piloting the drone, expressed in terms of latitude, longitude,
and geometric altitude.
• A timestamp of the message.
• An indicator of the emergency status of the drone.
The discussed requirements apply from the take-off to shutdown.
UAVs should broadcast the messages on an unlicensed radio fre-
quency (e.g., the worldwide ISM frequency band [2.4 − 2.5] GHz),
with a transmission rate of at least 1 message per second and maxi-
mum allowed latency of 1 second from the location acquisition.
The specification applies independently from the weight of the
UAV and the presence of an Internet connection on board or on
the control station (exceptions exist [22]). Overall, the operators
can assure the compliance of their UAVs to the RemoteID speci-
fication either through a built-in module or through a remote ID
broadcast module, integrated after deployment on an UAV via a soft-
ware update. Operation without a remote identification strategy
in compliance with the RemoteID specification is possible only at
specific areas, namely FAA-Recognized Identification Areas (FRIAs),
governed by community-based organizations or educational insti-
tutions.
We notice that although the specification aims to enhance the
safety and security of UAVs, the RemoteID specification does not
take cybersecurity into account. Indeed, the specification aims to
provide minimum performance requirement for the operation of
UAVs, while the implementation of dedicated security and privacy
strategies is left to UAV operators. Therefore, the specification does
not mandate the usage of any message authentication techniques
but only imposes that the FAA must be able to trace back the long-
term identity of the UAV and its owner through the unique identifier
broadcasted in the RemoteID messages.
According to the final rule, the unique identifier can be either
the serial number of the UAV, generated by the manufacturer, or
a session identification number (session ID). However, the session
IDs must allow the FAA and authorized entities to go back to the
long-term identity of the UAV. Note that the rule does not provide
any further detail on the deployment of session identifiers.
The rule just became effective in April 2021 [43]. However, the
UAV manufacturers will be required to comply with the direction
starting from September 2022, while this requirement will apply to
the pilots beginning from September 2023 [24].
4 SCENARIO AND ADVERSARIAL MODEL
This section describes the scenario and the adversary model con-
sidered in our work. Specifically, Section 4.1 illustrates the system
model, while Section 4.2 describes the adversary model.
4.1 System Model and Assumptions
The scenario assumed in this work is depicted in Figure 1.
We assume a generic UAV dn, that can be either an autonomous
vehicle or a Remotely-Piloted Aircraft System (RPAS), piloted via
a controller. We assume that dn would like to be compliant with
the latest specifications of the FAA on the remote identification.

the invading UAV as evidence of the invasion. The TA is the only
entity that can unveil the long-term identity of the UAVs carrying
out the invasion, in a way that the UAVs and their operators can
be accountable for the event.
In this context, the ARID solution we describe in this manu-
script aims at ensuring anonymity and message authenticity for
UAVs, protecting their long-term identity while operating in the
wild. Moreover, ARID enables CI operators to report eavesdropped
packets to the TA, to identify UAVs invading protected areas.

4.2 Adversary and Threat Models
The adversary assumed in our work, namely A features both pas-
sive and active features. On the one hand, A is a global eavesdrop-
per on the bandwidth B = [2.4 − 2.5] GHz. Thus, A can detect
and decode any message sent by UAVs on any of the channels
in B to identify and track a specific UAV. On the other hand, A
Figure 1: Scenario assumed in this work.
Therefore, dn broadcasts information about its location, speed, lo-
cation of the remote controller, time mark, emergency status, and
a unique identifier, as presented in Section 3. However, dn would
like to maintain anonymity, i.e., it would like not to share publicly
any information that would lead to the immediate and uncontrolled
identification of its serial number, MAC address, and owner infor-
mation. A solution to this issue, is for dn to transmit a pseudonym
that would allow only the authorized entities to disclose its real
identity.
We also assume that dn features enough processing capabilities
to support the execution of symmetric and asymmetric encryp-
tion operations. This latter is a realistic assumption, since all the
commercial drones available on the market feature CPUs able to
control the motors and the flight through dedicated algorithms,
much more expensive and complex than traditional symmetric
and asymmetric encryption schemes, often available also through
dedicated hardware support [38].
Without loss of generality, we assume that dn does not feature
an Internet connection and cannot communicate with any other
infrastructure element than its remote controller. At the same time,
in line with the FAA RemoteID specification, dn uses one of the WiFi
channels on the unlicensed frequency band B = [2.4 − 2.5] GHz to
communicate with the remote controller. In addition, we assume
that dn is fully compliant with the RemoteID specification. There-
fore, it does not shut down the RemoteID module, and it does not
falsify its location intentionally. To comply with the anonymity
requirement, we also assume that any RemoteID packet delivered
by dn contain an anonymized (e.g., nullified) MAC address.
Our scenario also assumes the presence of multiple CI operators,
e.g., the ones controlling airports, nuclear plants, military infrastruc-
tures, and other CIs. Such operators are interested in monitoring
the nearby of their physical premises, looking for UAVs approach-
ing and invading sensitive areas. To this aim, such entities leverage
multiple receiving radios, tuned on the unlicensed frequency band
B = [2.4 − 2.5] GHz, to listen for RemoteID messages. Whenever
any UAVs enter the monitored area, the legitimate receivers would
like to detect the event and identify the owner of the UAV. The iden-
tification of the owner can occur through communication between
the CI operator and a Trusted Authority (TA).
The TA is responsible for regulation and accountability of UAVs
activities. Before flying time, manufacturers and UAV operators
register the unique identity and additional information of their
UAVs with the TA. If an invasion attack occurs, the CI operators can
report the incident to the TA, providing the packets emitted from

also features active capabilities. For instance, it can replay packets
previously listened to and transmit rogue packets on the wireless
communication channel, trying to impersonate a specific drone
and falsifying its location reports. The combination of the passive
and active features described above contribute to defining A as an
adversary following the well-known Dolev-Yao attacker model [18].
Overall, the goal of the adversary is three-fold. First, the adver-
sary would like to obtain the long-term identity of a specific UAV
by simply listening to the broadcast RemoteID packets. Second, the
adversary would like to track the drone passively. Third, the adver-
sary would like to cheat the whole RemoteID system by making a
specific UAV appear in a given sensitive location.
5 ANONYMOUS REMOTE IDENTIFICATION
FRAMEWORK
This section provides all the details of the ARID scheme. Section 5.1
introduces the actors involved in ARID, while Section 5.2, Sec-
tion 5.3, and Section 5.4 illustrate the Registration, Online, and
Reporting Phase of ARID, respectively.
5.1 Actors
ARID involves the following actors.
• UAV dn. It is a generic UAV, compliant with the RemoteID rule.
While turned on, it emits on the bandwidth B anonymous
RemoteID packets, i.e., messages not directly leading to its
long-term identity, owner, and manufacturer.
• CI Operator r. It is a generic wireless receiver, deployed by
the operator of a CI, such as an airport. Its role is to listen to
the bandwidth B for wireless packets emitted by RemoteID-
compliant UAVs to timely detect any invasion. When an
invasion is detected, it reports such an event to the Authority
for follow-up investigation.
• Authority Auth. It is a Trusted Third-Party (TTP), such as the
Federal Avionic Administrator. Its role includes: (i) storing
the information on UAVs compliant with ARID, (ii) providing
cryptography materials for the correct operations of ARID,
and finally, (iii) analyzing reports provided by CI operators
on invasions of sensitive areas by UAVs, in a way to identify
the authenticity of the provided evidence and trace back
the long-term identity and owner of the UAV. Note that the
Authority does not need to communicate with the UAV dn
after the Registration, while it is supposed to host an online
service for reports submitted by CI operators.

ARID.
• Assume that the UAV dn has a private-public key pair(skn, pkn),
and a public-key certificate Cn, signed by a TTP (e.g. Veri-
zon [52]). After the establishment of the TLS connection, dn
provides to Auth the long-term identity IDn and the public
key certificate Cn (including the public key pkn).
• Assume that Auth has a private-public key pair (skA, pkA),
and a public-key certificate CA, signed by a Certification
Authority (CA). At the reception of the information from
dn, Auth stores in a local Registration Table the entry for Dn,
containing the tuple . Then, it provides to dn
the cryptography materials necessary to run ARID. These
materials include the public key pkA and the set of public
parameters of the cryptography system L, including, in turn,
the prime number p, the parameters a and b of the selected
elliptic curve, the generator point G of the elliptic curve, the
cyclic group G of the elliptic curve, the order n of the elliptic
curve, and the co-factor γ. Moreover, L also includes the defi-
nition of the cryptography algorithms necessary to run ARID,
i.e., the symmetric encryption scheme S, the public-key en-
cryption scheme E (implying the corresponding decryption
scheme D), the hashing function H, and the signature gener-
ation scheme siдn (implying the corresponding verification
scheme veri f y).
• At the reception of the message from Auth, dn locally stores
the public key pkA and the parameters L for use in the fol-
lowing Online Phase.
5.2 Registration Phase
The aim of the Registration Phase of ARID is to register an UAV with
the Authority, in a way to enable unique identification. At the same
time, the UAV receives the cryptography materials necessary to
run ARID. Figure 2 shows the sequence diagram of the Registration
Phase of ARID. Note that the interactions between the UAV (or
its owner, or its manufacturer) and the Authority occur through
a regular Internet connection, e.g., secured via the well-known
Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol.
The operations in this phase are described below.
After the completion of this phase, dn does not need any further
communication with the Authority. When an UAV cannot connect
to the Internet, the owner/operator can execute this phase on behalf
of the UAV, e.g., on a secure Internet-connected terminal. However,
the values of PA and L have to be stored manually on dn before any
operations.
Moreover, note that the Registration Table hosted on the Author-
ity can also be publicly available. Indeed, the information in the
table do not allow tampering or de-anonymization of ARID mes-
sages. We will formally verify this property of ARID in Section 6.
