This is not cloning the card its relaying it X distance. There are 
about 1 min windows.
4 stages of EMV transaction are being captured and released into a 
tunnel to speak to another ATM or POS.
The cash out device regurgitates the exact “send and receive” from 
a shimmed device to the cash out device.
The shimmed device is told to hold while the tunneled transaction 
happens.
PIN information is also passed in real time to cash out device.
POS limit shimmed will not count against the ATM daily limit.

Introducing La-Cara
Why would criminals automate cashout?
People are un-trustable
Cashout crews brag about it on social media
Busted humans rat out their accomplices
Machines don’t usually have twitter accounts.
Defcon Theme this year is Rise of the machines
@LaCaraATM
ATMs don’t have a twitter account ….
