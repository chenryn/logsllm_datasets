The above inequality gives the lower bound for Kh. Although Kh is 
related  to  the  number  of  active  flows  and  propagation  delay,  the 
restriction  is  substantially  loose.  If  Kh  is  two  or  three  magnitudes 
larger than the lower bound determined by a certain network, it will 
be applicable for a broad network condition. 
Now,  we  will  give  a  proposition  for  the  design  of  a  stable 
compensation system.

The  reference  queue  size  in  PI  is  20  and  other  parameters  are 
consistent with default settings in ns. Assume N-=60, R+=0.22sec, C 
is 1250pkt/s which corresponds to 10Mbps with an average packet 
size of 1KB. According to the conditions described in (5)~(7), the 
parameters of PIP can be selected as Kh=0.0014,τ=0.4,T=200.

A. Experiment 1 
In this experiment, we compare the responsiveness and queue size of 
PIP  and  PI  in  the  presence  of  long-lived  FTP  flows  only.  The 
number of FTP flows is 100 at the beginning and 100 additional FTP 
flows arrive at the link 50 seconds later. The total simulation lasted 
for 100s. The queue lengths for the two algorithms are depicted in 
Figure 4a. As shown in the figure, the queue length of PI climbs to 
the highest point when the number of FTP flows increases from zero 
to  100,  then  falls  towards  the  target  value  when  the  load  level 
stabilizes.  Once  the  number  of  FTP  flows  increases  suddenly,  the 
queue length increases as before and converges slowly once again. 
On the contrary, PIP keeps the queue length at the desired value with 
little oscillations even in the face of abrupt load variations. So we 
can see PIP reacts reasonably promptly. 
In  contrast  to  the  100  additional  FTP  flows  added  in  the  forward 
path, we introduce them gradually in the reverse path at 50 seconds. 
In this experiment, both r1 and r2 run PIP. The queue lengths of r1 
and  r2  are  depicted  in  Figure  4b  and  Figure  4c  respectively.  The 
dynamics  of  the  queues  in  r1  are  the  same  as  before  during  the 
beginning 55 seconds. When the reverse traffic is totally activated at 
55 second, the queue length of PI falls sharply. About 35 seconds 
later, it rises again. This can be better explained by the ACK queuing 
in the reverse path. In Figure 4c, it is shown that the queue length in 
the reverse congested link is high from 55 to 90 second, which aptly 
corresponds  to  the  low  queue  size  in  the  forward  congested  link. 
Before the delayed ACK arrives at the source, the sending rate in the 
forward path is slow, so the queue length of r1 is small. In PIP, such 
an anti-phase property in large time scale is not very evident because 
the queue sizes in both congested links are small. 
From the conditions described in (6), we have

demonstrates  that  the  packet  drop  probability  is  increased  when 
either the current queue length is larger than the reference value or 
the increment value of the queue length is great. Under the opposite 
conditions, it is decreased. So, PIP can keep the queue around the 
target  value  with  constrained  oscillations.  The  packet  drop 
probability  is  updated  in  a  constant  frequency,  typically  around 
200Hz. Furthermore, the performance of PIP is not very sensitive to 
the value of the frequency. 
4.  SIMULATIONS 
In this section we evaluate our design by NS simulator. We study the 
performance  of  PIP  in  various  traffic  conditions  and  specially 
compare  it  with  PI.  In  addition  to  infinite,  greedy  flows,  we 
introduce  short,  bursty  flows  and  unresponsive  flows  to  generate 
more realistic scenarios.  
We  use  simple  network  topology  with  a  single  bottleneck  link 
between  r1  and  r2  as  depicted  in  Figure  3.Connections  are 
established  between  si  and  di.  The  propagation  delay  ranges 
uniformly between 40ms and 220ms.Unless otherwise specified, the 
buffer  size  in  r1  is  500  packets.  r1  runs  PIP  and  supports  ECN 
marking,  while  the  other  router  runs  Drop  Tail.  To  imitate  real 
network situations, we adopt four ordinary traffic types, i.e., infinite 
FTP flows and burst HTTP flows based on TCP-Reno, CBR flows 
and exponential ON/OFF flows based on UDP. Among them, FTP 
flows  always  have  data  to  send  during  simulation  runtime.  In 
contrast to long-lived FTP flows, HTTP flows are short-lived with 
an  average  page  size  of  1024B  and  an  average  request  interval  of 
1s.The packet size of CBR flows is 500B and the sending interval is 
0.5s.The burst and idle times of the ON/OFF service model are 10s

B. Experiment 2 
In this experiment, we use a mixture of FTP and HTTP flows and 
remove all time varying dynamics. The number of FTP flows is kept 
at 80 and that of HTTP sessions is 100. The queue dynamics of PI 
and PIP are plotted in Figure 5. Again, fast responsiveness and small 
oscillations  for  PIP  are  observed.  The  queue  length  of  PI  is  very 
large compared to PIP at any time.

C. Experiment 3 
Here, we use two mixtures: FTP and CBR flows as well as FTP and 
ON/OFF  flows.  The  number  of  FTP  flows  is  kept  at  100.  The 
number  of  CBR  flows  and  the  number  of  ON/OFF  flows  are  50 
respectively. The queue lengths, plotted in Figure 6a and Figure 6b, 
show that PIP reaches the steady state in a short time, whereas PI 
takes a much longer time to stabilize.

improved in the case of a light load while the oscillation seriously 
deteriorates.  At  the  other  end  of  load  spectrum,  PI  takes  a  longer 
time to converge. On the contrary, under PIP, there is no significant 
difference between the two extremes.
