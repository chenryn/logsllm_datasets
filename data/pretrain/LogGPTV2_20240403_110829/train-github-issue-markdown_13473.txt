[x ] I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is
not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
Text field of this select field should not be cleared when its dropdown is
opened.
## Current Behavior
Text field is cleared
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
http://www.material-ui.com/#/components/select-field
  1. Select someting in select field.
  2. Open the select field dropdown again.
  3. With dev inspector, move the overlaying dropdown. You will see text field without value.
## Context
It triggers me the change of select field which I need to detect. But the
change should only happen if the user actually selected something differently
than the current value.
