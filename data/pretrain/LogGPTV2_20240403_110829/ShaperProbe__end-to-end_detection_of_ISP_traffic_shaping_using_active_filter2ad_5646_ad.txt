and an associated burst size mode (for ﬁgure, see [17]).
About 80% of 333 runs that have the shaping rate modes
come from hostnames that resolve to the domain mchsi.com,
owned by the cable ISP Mediacom [9]. So, it is possible
(though we can not be certain) that these shaping detec-
tions were not errors afterall.
5. CONCLUSION
In this work, we presented an end-to-end active prob-
ing, detection, and estimation method of traﬃc shaping in
ISPs. Our evaluation using controlled experiments and in
two known ISP deployments shows that ShaperProbe has
false positive and false negative detection rates of less than
5%. We presented a ﬁrst large-scale study of shaping at
four large ISPs, and validated some of our observations us-
ing ISP advertised tier data. A strong modality of shaping
rates and burst sizes suggests that ISPs typically deploy a
small set of shaping conﬁgurations. We found some shap-
ing detections for which the ISPs do not mention shaping
in their service descriptions4. Lack of publicly-available in-
formation, however, does not necessary imply that these are
false detections. We are currently working on passive shap-
ing detection methods (for preliminary results, see [17]).
4ISPs, however, typically mention in their SLAs that “listed
capacities may vary”.

“ShaperProbe: End-to-End Detection of ISP Traffic 
Shaping Using Active Methods” 
Authors: P. Kanuparthy, C. Dovrolis 
Reviewer #1 
Strengths:	 Traffic  shaping  is  a  timely  problem;  residential 
networking is interesting in general. The paper is relatively well-
written. Collecting a taxonomy of service tiers is significant.  
Weaknesses: Very mature work; references to a tech report that 
would  seem  to  have  the  interesting  components  of  the  tool’s 
design;  unsurprising  conclusions  and  no  clear  statement  about 
traffic  shaping  as  good  or  evil.  No  experimentation  into  per-
application (or port) shaping. 
Comments  to  Authors:  This  work  is  complete  enough  to  get 
press  coverage,  therefore  it  is  complete  enough  to  have  a  full 
paper worth of submission and not be presented as an abstract of a 
longer tech report. It does not fit the description “Short papers (up 
to 7 two-column pages) can convey work that is less mature but 
shows  promise,  articulating  a  high-level  vision,  describing 
challenging  future  directions,  critiquing  current  measurement 
wisdom or offering results that do not merit a full submission.”

The  one  paragraph  “ShaperProbe  Implementation”  section  was 
most disappointing. To understand the quality of your tool, I don’t 
need an equation for the median (2.2); I do need a sense for the 
tradeoffs in parameters: what if I believe that the buckets are just 
too small for you to detect? How do you generate traffic at a truly 
constant  rate?  How  do  you  filter?  Submit  the  12-14  pager;  it 
might  be  more  interesting.  Conversely,  perhaps  your  passive 
shaping  detection  method  (conclusion  section)  would  be  a  good 
topic for a 6 page submission. 
Reviewer #2 
Strengths:  Interesting  and  timely  topic;  publicly  release  tool; 
real-world data; interesting findings. 
Weaknesses: Some graphs are a bit hard to read. 
Comments  to  Authors:  This 
everything one could ask for.  
I really appreciate you making the tool available to the Internet at 
large and collecting data from real users for your analysis.  
The presentation is also very well done; I only have some minor 
issues with some of the graphs in page 5 and 6. Fig. 4 and 7 are 
hard to parse; it would help if you could “read” one of them when 
you introduce them in page 4. You jump too quickly to the tables 
that  summarize  the  data  but  the  figures,  if  explained,  offer  an 
interesting perspective.  
is  great  work  with  almost 
How  common  would  you  expect  cross  traffic  to  result  on  an 
empty  token  bucket  and  make  it  impossible  for  ShaperProbe  to 
detect shaping? 
Reviewer #3 
Strengths:  The  paper  presents  a  clear  method  to  detect  traffic 
shaping.  A  large  data  set  is  available  to  the  authors.  There  is  a 
comparison with ground truths. 
Weaknesses:  This  should  have  been  a  long  paper:  not  enough 
details about the methodology (e.g. detection of C, the capacity) 
and  not  enough  results  shared  (e.g.  you  got  results  about  5700 
ISPs  and  you  only  discuss  4  ISPs.  In  how  many  ISPs  did  you 
detect  traffic  shaping?).  The  false  positive  rate  claimed  in  the 
conclusion is not backed up by content in the paper. Where does 
the number come from? 
Comments to Authors: I tried your tool. I liked it; it was simple 
and clear to use.  
You  mentioned  that  the  data  collected  is  publicly  available. 
Where is it? I couldn’t find the data. Maybe I missed something, 
you should make it more clear where it is located.  
You have a 14 page version on your homepage, you should have 
submitted it. This is mature work, and there are enough questions 
to answer and enough data for a full evaluation to fill up 14 pages. 
The 6 page paper skips a lot of them.  
What  happens  if  the  bucket  size  is  really  small?  Wouldn’t  you 
simply not detect traffic shaping with your methodology?  
In  the  intro,  you  mention  “services  up  to  6  Mbps”.  This  is 
typically  for  DSL  services  and  has  nothing  to  do  with  traffic 
shaping. I wouldn’t make that third point.  
You may want to better articulate the differences with Glasnot in 
the related work section  
In  the  active  probing  method,  you  mention  that  Rs=C  without 
explaining  how  you  measure  C  and  more  importantly  whether 
your  method  of  measuring  C  could  be  influenced  by  traffic 
shaping in place or not. If some settings of traffic shaping could 
influence your detection of C, then you could have a lot of false 
negatives. 
You  don’t  discuss  enough  the  robustness  of  your  tool  to  the 
impact of cross traffic.  
I am really pleased to see a parameter selection section! I like it.  
How can some burst last 5mn in traffic shaping environments on 
figure 3? Is that really traffic shaping?  
480Your results section doesn’t discuss your millions of results from 
5700 ISPs. You go through 4 ISPS as case studies. Case studies 
are great after you present your overall results which are missing. 
For  instance,  were  all  your  cases  of  traffic  shaping  for  cable 
providers (good point about DSL vs. cable)?  
“non shaped runs”: while you say the distributions are similar. It 
is interesting to note that you see a step function for the capacity 
of the shaped traffic.  
The  AT&T  case  study  seems  to  be  an  issue  where  you  include 
traffic  from  multiple  ISPs  (Mediacom).  If  that’s  the  case,  why 
don’t you just present the results per ASN? This should solve the 
issue. AT&T would probably not use the same ASN for its own 
subscribers  and  for  the  subscribers  of  companies,  such  as 
Mediacom, buying transit from its tier 1 network.  
The  false  positive  and  false  negative  rates  are  important  when 
presenting these kinds of results. You claim specific rates in the 
conclusion (less than 5%), yet you didn’t explain how you came 
up with these numbers. 
Reviewer #4 
Strengths:  Reasonable  tool  and  design.  Lots  of  great  data  from 
the  wild  to  work  with.  Confirmation  of  at  least  some  of  the 
results, which suggests that the tool is fairly accurate. 
Weaknesses: A more serious and extensive evaluation of the tool 
in a controlled setting would improve confidence in it, and help to 
better understand its weaknesses. 
Comments  to  Authors:  Fun  paper.  I’ve  used  the  tool  a  couple 
different times in the past (it wasn’t able to detect known shaping 
in my campus network, fwiw). I like the presentation of results in 
the form of case studies.  
In most cases it appears that shaperprobe detects the right thing, 
but  there  are  clearly  some  fraction  of  runs  in  which  the  tool  is 
wrong.  It  would  have  been  nice  to  have  some  experiments  in  a 
controlled  setting  using  “real”  routers  and  other  devices,  along 
with  some  cross  traffic,  to  get  a  better  sense  of  the  tool’s 
limitations.  The  minimal  Linux  experiments  are  nice,  but  aren’t 
terribly  enlightening  since they’re run in a setting in which you 
don’t have control to create conditions that could be problematic 
for  the  tool,  e.g.,  congestion  somewhere  on  the  path  that  might 
cause a level shift-like event.  
Reviewer #5 
Strengths: A method to detect and infer the parameters of “token 
bucket” mechanism employed in most of today shapers. Analysis 
of a large scale measurement of the tool that provides interesting 
information about today’s networks. 
Weaknesses:  The  method  is  susceptible  to  cross  traffic.  More 
extensive  evaluation  of  the  tool  under  different  cross-traffic 
settings is needed. 
Comments to Authors: I like the idea of detecting and inferring 
parameters of the packet shapers. Your effort in implementing and 
performing large scale validation of your tools is commendable. 
Below are detailed comments.  
Section  2,  by  having  large  $\Delta$  you  will  need  long 
measurement  time.  How  does  the  measurement  time  affect  the 
accuracy of your estimations?  
Section  2.1,  The  receiving  rate  highly  depends  on  cross-traffic, 
not  just  the  shapers.  How  does  cross  traffic  affect  the  received 
rate, hence your estimations? I would like to see more evaluation 
of the method with regards to the cross traffic.  
Section 2.3, You mention in Section 2.1 that $N_L$ and $n_R$ 
will be selected from the ISP data, but you do not actually explain 
how  do  you  set  these  parameters  in  your  measurements. 
Furthermore, you set the other parameters, e.g. $\gamma$, using 
data  from  some  specific  ISPs.  You  then  use  these  parameter 
values  for  measurements  on  other  networks.  As  networks  are 
different, you should really change these parameters for different 
networks too.  
Section  4.1,  you  mention  that  you  verify  your  results  with 
Comcast  listings.  Where  are  the  results  of  the  verification?  In 
general, it is very hard to verify the results in Section 4 as ground-
truth data is not available. You should consider cross validation. 
Using a subset of measurements for inference and another subset 
to validate the inference results.  
Section 5, where does the accuracy result come from? 
Response from the Authors 
Regarding the ``long versus short paper’’ issue: there is indeed a 
longer version of this work that includes, first, more detail about 
the  implementation  of  the  tool,  and  second,  a  method  to  detect 
traffic  shaping  passively  given  packet-level  traces.  The  passive 
estimation  algorithm  is  significantly  different  than  ShaperProbe, 
and  its  evaluation  also  follows  a  different  approach.  So,  we 
decided to split the work in two papers: this IMC short paper and 
a  second  paper  (passive  detection)  that  will  be  published  later. 
This  short  IMC  paper  cannot  describe  all  the  implementation 
details  of  ShaperProbe  --  if  we  would  include  those  details  in  a 
long  paper,  we  suspect  that  most  readers  would  find  them 
uninteresting.  Additionally,  we  note  that  it  is  not  true  that  IMC 
short  papers  are  not  ``less  mature’’  than  long  papers.  IMC  has 
published many short but mature research papers in the last few 
years, which is great. Not every significant research contribution 
requires 12 pages. 
We  have revised the paper to address the presentation problems 
that  the  reviewers  identified.  Additionally,  we  have  added  a  bit 
more information in Section 3 about how the tool works. 
There  are  also  some  comments  that  we  could  not  address  (e.g., 
additional  validation  results  or  a  more  thorough  study  of  the 
robustness with respect to cross traffic). Due to space constraints, 
we focus here on two comments that appear in several reviews: 
(1) It is true that if the token bucket is too small we may not be 
able to detect it. However, such a traffic shaper would not make 
much performance difference at the first place. In practice, we see 
that  Cable-access  ISPs  typically  use  a  bucket  size  of  at  least  5-
10MB, and ShaperProbe can detect that.  
(2) If the path has significant cross traffic, ShaperProbe will abort 
the measurements (because it will detect packet losses). So, even 
though it is true that cross traffic can cause the token bucket to be 
non-full,  ShaperProbe  will  avoid  producing  erroneous  results  in 
that case.
