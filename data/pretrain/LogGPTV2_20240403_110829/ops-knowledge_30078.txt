User: I already have a web application in written in Python 2 that runs over WSGI (specifically, OpenERP web server).
I would like to write a new web application that would run on the same server (Apache 2 on Ubuntu), but using WSGI and Python 3. The two applications would be on different ports.
Is that possible?
Assistant: Its quite possible. This is what virtualenv as all about. Set up the second app in a virtualenv , with python3 .
You an add it in a virtualhost configuration in apache.
