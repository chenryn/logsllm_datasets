### Automated Search Tools and Caller ID Services

Among the various automated search tools, this one stands out for its time-saving capabilities. You can input an area code, prefix, and number to execute comprehensive queries. Additionally, I have included a section for Caller ID services that allow you to query via direct URLs. To use these services, you must add your API keys to the source code of the page. While I prefer the previously explained script, I want to provide you with multiple options.

The search tool includes a number and word area that replicates techniques mentioned earlier, which attempt to search both the numbers and words of a target telephone number within Google, Bing, and Craigslist. Figure 18.03 illustrates the current state of the tool.

### Chapter 19: Online Maps

#### Google Maps (maps.google.com)

**Satellite View:**
- The lower left area of any map offers a satellite view, providing a direct, top-down view from the sky.
- A satellite view of your target location is essential for every investigation.

**Globe View:**
- The Globe view (globe icon) in the lower right corner provides a unique perspective from a different date.
- It also offers a rotation option. Click on the "3D" icon and then the small "rotation" icon to shift the view by 45 degrees, allowing for new angles of your target.

Google continually updates its online Maps service to enhance usability. Over the past two years, features have been added and removed, but the following basics are now default for all users:

**Search Bar:**
- The search bar accepts a wide range of inputs, including full or partial addresses, GPS coordinates, company names, and types of businesses like "cafe."
- This search field is the first stop for any relevant search. You can collapse the menu by clicking the left arrow next to the search field to return to a full-screen map view.

**Online Satellite Images:**
- The availability of detailed satellite images is no longer a novelty. Most people have "Googled" their own address to view their home from the sky.
- The zoom feature reveals hidden details such as alleys, sheds, and extended driveways. Tactical units often use this data before executing a search warrant at a residence.
- Aerial maps help in identifying exit doors, escape routes, stairs, and obstructions. The Street View option provides even more detailed information.

**Street View:**
- If available, Street View allows you to see a ground-level photo of the location. Dragging and dropping the small orange person in the lower right menu opens a street view.
- Navigation is possible by clicking forward, dragging, or scrolling and zooming. Double-clicking an area refreshes the window to that location.
- Clicking the map in the lower left returns you to the standard map view.

**Historic Street View:**
- In late 2014, Google introduced the ability to view all stored street view images for a single location.
- This feature is accessible within the standard street view layout. Clicking the small clock icon launches a pop-up window with a slider bar to view different images, along with the month and year of capture.
- Figure 19.01 shows an example of a parking lot from a few years prior, revealing additional vehicles or missing structures.

**Distance Measurement:**
- Right-click on your starting point and choose "Measure distance." Click anywhere on the map to create a path and measure it. You can drag points to move them or click to remove them.
- The total distance in miles or kilometers appears under the search box. When finished, right-click and select "Clear measurement."

**URL Queries:**
- For the search tool, always identify the GPS coordinates of your target. In the examples, 41.947242 is the latitude and -87.65673 is the longitude.
- Static URLs for various Google Maps views are provided to quickly query multiple services once a target location is identified.

**Bing Maps (bing.com/maps):**
- Similar to Google Maps, Bing offers map, satellite, angled, and street views.
- The imagery provided by Bing is often unique compared to Google Maps. Custom URLs can replicate all views.

**Other Mapping Services:**
- **Zoom Earth (zoom.earth):** Offers full-screen satellite images without branding, menus, or borders.
- **Here (wego.here.com):** Provides historical and current satellite imagery.
- **Yandex (yandex.com/maps):** Often has poor-quality satellite images for U.S. locations but clearer results for international locations.
- **Descartes Labs (maps.descarteslabs.com):** Offers unique image-based search options.
- **Snapchat (map.snapchat.com):** Allows viewing of public stories posted through Snapchat.
- **Wikimapia (wikimapia.org):** Combines various satellite options and crowd-sourced data.
- **Dual Maps (data.mashedworld.com/dualmaps/map.htm):** Displays satellite views from Google and Bing simultaneously.
- **Real Estate (zillow.com, redfin.com, etc.):** Provides interior images of homes for sale or recently sold.
- **Vidi (vidi.world):** Combines satellite options and crowd-sourced data.
- **Historic Imagery:**
  - **Historic Aerials (historicaerials.com):** Offers historical aerial images.
  - **World Imagery Wayback (livingadas.arcgis.com/wayback):** Provides high-quality, high-number satellite views.
  - **Old Maps Online (oldmapsonline.org):** Offers road maps from the past 100 years.

**Crowd-Sourced Street Views:**
- **Mapillary (mapillary.com):** Allows viewing of crowd-sourced street-level images.
- **Land Viewer (eos.com/landviewer):** Provides weather satellite images and historic imagery.
- **Karta (kanaview.org):** Previously called Open Street Cam, offers unique street-level images.

**Real-World Application:**
- Combining several satellite views can provide valuable information about a target's residence. Before executing a search warrant, police can collect updated views, satellite imagery, and street views to identify potential threats and escape routes.

**Landsat Look (landsatlook.usgs.gov):**
- Offers three unique maps with additional historic images, viewable within a browser.

By leveraging these tools and services, investigators can gather comprehensive and detailed information about a target location, enhancing the effectiveness of their investigations.
