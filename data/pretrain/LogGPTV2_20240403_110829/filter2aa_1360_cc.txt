Of all the automated search tools, this one may save the most time. You can submit an area code, prefix, and 
number and execute all queries. I also added a section of Caller ID services which allow query via direct URL. 
If you want to use those, you must add your API keys to the source code of the page. I prefer the script 
previously explained, but I want you to have options. The number and word area on the search tool replicates 
the techniques mentioned previously which attempt to search both the numbers and words of a target telephone 
number within Google, Bing, and Craigslist Figure 18.03 displays the current state of the tool.

Satellite View: The lower left area of any map will offer a satellite view. The satellite view is a direct view from 
the sky looking almost straight down. A satellite new of your target location is always vital to ever}’ investigation.

Globe View: The Globe view (globe icon) in the lower right is similar, but usually offers a unique view from a 
different date. It also presents a rotation option. While in die Globe view, click on the "3D" icon and then the 
small "rotation1’ icon to the right of the map. This will shift the view 45 degrees and a second click will shift an 
additional 45 degrees. This presents new angles of your target
Google constandy makes changes to their online Maps service, attempting to streamline the entire Maps 
experience to make everything easier to use. Over the past two years, we have witnessed features come and go, 
only to randomly re-appear. The following basics of Google Maps are now default for all users.
Search Bar: The Google Maps search bar can now accept practically any type of input A full address, partial 
address, or GPS coordinates will immediately present you with a mapped view. Company names and types of 
businesses, such as "cafe’’ will highlight locations that may be of interest. This search field is the first stop. 
Attempt any search relevant to your investigation and you may be surprised at how accurate Google is. You can 
collapse this entire menu by clicking the left arrow next to the search field. This will return you to a full screen 
view of the map.
The presence of online satellite images is not news anymore. Most of you have already "Googled" your own 
address and viewed your home from the sky. This view can get surprisingly detailed when using the zoom 
feature. Alleys, sheds, and extended driveways that are hidden from the street are now visible thanks to this free 
service. Many tactical units will examine this data before executing a search warrant at a residence. Aerial maps 
arc helpful for viewing the location of exiting doors, escape routes, stairs, and various obstructions. The rapidly 
growing availability of the Street View option now gives us more data. This chapter explains detailed use of 
Google, Bing, and other mapping services. At the end, I present my custom maps tool which provides an 
automated solution to collecting ever}’ possible view associated with your target of interest
Street View: If the Street View option is available, Google has been in the area and captured a photo of the 
location from the street. Dragging and dropping the small orange person in the lower right menu will open a 
street view from ground level at the area specified. You can navigate through this view by clicking forward, 
clicking and dragging, or scrolling and zooming. This view can be zoomed in by double-clicking and panned left 
and right by dragging the mouse while holding a left click. Double-clicking an area of the street will refresh the 
window to the view from that location. Clicking the map in the lower left will return you to the standard map 
view.
Historic Street View: In late 2014, Google began offering the ability to view all stored street view images for 
any single location. This option is available within the standard street view layout within the search area of the 
upper left comer. Click on the small clock in order to launch a pop-up window. This new view will allow you to 
move a slider bar which will present different views. The month and year of image capture will also appear for 
documentation. Figure 19.01 displays this method which presents an additional view of a parking lot from a few 
years prior. Additional options include views from several years prior. This can often reveal additional vehicles 
or missing structures associated with an investigation.

Distance Measurement: Google Maps reintroduced die distance measurement tool after completely disabling 
the classic maps interface in 2015. While in map or satellite view, right-click on your starting point and choose 
"Measure distance". Click anywhere on the map to create a path you want to measure. Further clicks add 
additional measuring points. You can also drag a point to move it, or click a point to remove it. The total distance 
in both miles or kilometers will appear under the search box. When finished, right-click on the map and select 
clear measurement.
Google Street Views possess multiple options, including a 360-degree horizontal scope and vertical pitch. I have 
created the following URLs which we will use in our custom tools. These offer a view of north, east, south, and 
west with no pitch. After each URL loads, you can use the cursor to drag the view to fit your needs.

URL Queries: For the purposes of the search tool, which is explained at the end of the chapter, we always 
want to identify the GPS coordinates of our target. In my examples throughout the chapter, 41.947242 is the 
latitude coordinate and -87.65673 is the longitude. The static search URLs I explain throughout this chapter will 
assist us in quickly querying multiple services once we identify a target location. The static URL displaying 
various Google Maps views of our target location is as follows.
GPS Coordinates: Clicking on any point will load a small window in the bottom center that identifies the exact 
GPS coordinates of the chosen location. If this is not visible, right-click any point and select "What’s here". 
Searching via GPS will be more precise than other queries.

Similar to Google Maps, Bing offers a map view, satellite view, angled view, and street view. In my experience, 
the imagery provided by Bing will always be unique to the images available in Google Maps. A side-by-side 
comparison can be seen in a few pages with the custom maps tool. Bing does not always present the various 3D 
view options, which they call "Bird's Eye View". Fortunately, we can replicate all views with the following custom 
URLs.

This sendee has experienced a lot of transformation over the past ten years. Originally a Nokia company with a 
unique set of satellite imagery, it now mostly contains identical images to Bing Maps. However, I find unique 
images on occasion, and we should always consider every resource. The static URL with satellite view is as 
follows.
This multiple satellite imagery website presents views from NASA, Bing, and ArcGIS. Occasionally, the ArcGIS 
data is more recent than Google or Bing. The smooth interface will easily provide a comparison of the available 
images for any location. One advantage of Zoom Earth is the ability to view satellite images in true full-screen 
mode. This allows creation of full-screen captures without branding, menus, or borders. This could be more 
appropriate for live demonstration instead of a standard Google or Bing window. The static URLs with satellite 
view are as follows. The "20z" is the maximum zoom level. The second URL is a historic view from the 
Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) database.
This sendee offers a very unique search option that I have not found present on any other site. After locating a 
target of interest, it displays a satellite view sourced from the National Agriculture Imagery’ Program (NAIP). 
The unique part is the ability to search based on image. In other words, you can select a monument, park, 
building, or any other view and request any images that match. As an example, I selected the baseball grounds 
at Wrigley Field and I was immediately presented hundreds of baseball fields all over the world. I have yet to 
determine how I would execute this strategy within an investigation, but this feature has potential.
This was mentioned previously while discussing social networks, but should also be present here. This map 
allows you to zoom into a location and view any public stories posted through Snapchat. I find this does not 
work well when investigating a home address, but can be incredibly useful when researching a specific event, 
school, or public area. The static URL is as follows.

If you need live video from a specific location, you can hire someone through this site. If you wanted a live 
video stream in front of a specific business, you can offer a "bounty" for that task. If a member in that area 
accepts, the footage is sent electronically. We live in strange yet fascinating times.
I began using this site in 2018 as an alternative to Historic Aerials. The quality is superior, the number of satellite 
views is higher, and the functionality' is smoother. Figure 19.03 displays four images acquired from the sendee 
of a specific location. Each provides a unique view from 2014, 2015,2016, and 2017.
This website provides a satellite view of a location on both Google Maps and Bing Maps simultaneously. The 
Google view on the left will also contain a search field in the lower left comer. Searching an address in this field 
will center both maps on the same address. This will provide a comparison of the satellite images stored on each 
service. This can quickly identify the service that has the better imagery'. While this can provide a quick side-by- 
side comparison, upcoming automated solutions are preferred.
If you simply need road maps from the past 100 years, this service has you covered. There are no images or 
satellite views, but street details from previous decades could be useful. You might learn that a target location 
possessed a different street name in the past or identify the approximate year when a specific road was built.
If you need satellite imagery’ from several years prior, you can visit Historic Aerials. The quality’ will often be 
poor, especially as you view imagery from previous decades. After you enter an address, you wall be presented 
all available options on the left side of the page. Figure 19.02 displays several results of the same location over 
a twenty-year period. These views will be unique from all of the previously' mentioned services.
These websites display information about homes which are currently available for sale or have recently sold. I 
usually search this option in hopes of locating interior images of a suspect home. This can often identify personal 
belongings, interests, and family' information. It is a bit of a long-shot, but has been vital to a few of my 
investigations.
This is a great catch-all option. It combines the various satellite options for Google, Bing, and others. It also 
possesses crowd-sourced data and images. The menu in the upper right allows you to choose the satellite service 
while clicking on any location or building and presents a report of images, websites, and details about the target.
Researching different satellite views of a single location can have many benefits. These views are all of the 
current content stored within each service. However, these mapping services continuously update their offerings 
and usually* present the most recent option. You may’ want to view the previous content that was available before 
an image was updated.

In 2020,1 assisted a former colleague with a missing person investigation. Google and Bing maps were queried, 
but nothing helpful was found. However, a search on Mapillary (explained next) revealed a vehicle parked 
outside the victim's residence which was otherwise unknown to investigators. This clue opened a new path of 
investigation which ultimately led my colleague to the victim. \Vc must always thoroughly check every resource.

Real World Application: Combining several satellite views can provide much information about a target's 
residence. Before the execution of a search warrant, it is beneficial for police to collect as much map information 
as possible. This will give updated views of a drawn map, satellite imagery directly above the house, four angled 
views from the sky, and a complete view of the house and neighboring houses from the street, including vehicles. 
This can be used to identify- potential threats such as physical barriers, escape routes, and video surveillance 
systems in place.

Karta (kanaview.org)
This resource will not present detailed views of your target's home. The images here are often generated from 
weather satellites, and restrict zoom levels to a city view. Most locations offer four active satellites that constandy 
retrieve images and five inoperative satellites that store historic imagery dating back to 1982. I have only used 
this resource to document potential weather at a crime scene (clouds, rain, or dear). The static URL follows.
After exhausting your options on Mapillary, continue to Karta, previously called Open Street Cam. The site 
functions in the same way, but possesses unique images. These sites allow you to identify the uploader's 
username, mapping history, number of posted images, and profile image. You can also select to watch all of the 
captured images from a specific user as he or she travels daily. I can't begin to imagine the amount information 
available about a user's travel habits if he or she were to become a target of an investigation. While there is not 
coverage of every area like we see with Google Maps, the databases are growing rapidly, and should be included 
when using other mapping tools. We will use the following URL structure for our automated tools.

Street View maps from sendees such as Google and Bing are nothing new. Most of you can view the top and 
front of your home from multiple online websites. With street view options, these services arc fairly responsible 
and block most faces and license plates. This makes it difficult for investigators trying to identify' a suspect 
vehicle parked at a home or present at a crime scene prior to the incident We have two sendees that offer unique 
street-level views that may remove these limitations.
This service appears similar to other mapping websites when first loaded. You see a typical map view identifying 
streets, landmarks, and buildings. Enabling the satellite view layer displays images from the Open Street Map 
project. The real power is within the crowd-sourced street view images. While in any map view, colored lines 
indicate that an individual has provided street-level images to Mapillary, usually from a GPS-enabled smart 
phone. This is actually quite common, as many people record video of their driving trips which could be used 
in case of an accident. These services make it easy and automated to upload these images. The sites then embed 
these images within their own mapping layers for the public to see. Clicking these colored lines reveals the street 
view images in the lower portion of the screen. Expanding these images allows you to navigate through that 
individual's images similar to the Google Street View experience. Figure 19.04 displays a street view layered over 
a satellite view. The username of the Mapillary member and date of image capture appears in the lower left.
In some of these images, the services appear to be redacting license plates with a typical "Blur Box' as seen in 
Figure 19.05 (left). A few feet later, the box disappears and a partially legible license plate is revealed, as seen in 
Figure 19.05 (right). It seems like these services are attempting to determine when a license plate is legible, and 
then blurring it. When the plate is farther away and more difficult to read, it is ignored. This can work in our 
favor. In Figure 19.06 we can use selective cropping and photo manipulation to obtain the registration. The left 
image appears unaltered as it is difficult to read. The right image was cropped; inverted with Photoshop; 
brightness turned down to 0%; and contrast heightened to 100%. The result is a legible license plate. I believe 
most registration plates can be made visible within these services. The following URL conducts a query for our 
target location.
