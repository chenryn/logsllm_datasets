Use case: I have an an entity with 10 properties, and a form which only edits
2 of those properties. That form has all the fields in the entity, but it only
renders these 2 in the template.
The incoming request only has these 2 properties set, but when I bind it to
the form, already populated with the entity in the Database, all files not
included in the request are set to null.
I would not like create a new form for this, so i feel that the bindRequest
command should not reset missing fields to null in the entity, only ignore
them.
This line seems to be the trouble

Is this an issue? Can it be solved?
