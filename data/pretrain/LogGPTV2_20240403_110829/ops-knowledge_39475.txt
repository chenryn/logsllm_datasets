To improve the clarity, coherence, and professionalism of the log data, I have restructured it as follows:

---

**Log Record:**
- **File Name:** `nova-compute.log.1.2017-05-16_13:55:31`
- **Date:** 2017-05-16
- **Time:** 00:00:04.693
- **Process ID (PID):** 2931
- **Severity Level:** INFO
- **Component:** `nova.compute.manager`
- **Request ID:** `req-3ea4052c-895d-4b64-9e2d-04d64c4d94ab`
- **Instance ID:** `b9000564-fe1a-409b-b8cc-1e88b294cd1d`
- **Message:** "During `sync_power_state`, the instance has a pending task (spawning). Skip."
- **Timestamp (Unix Epoch):** 1494864004

This structured format allows for easier readability and parsing, making the information more accessible for both human and machine processing.
