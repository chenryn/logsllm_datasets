AccordingtoWikipedia
ere's how Wikipedia defines each tech topic we have discussed in
this book.
Internet Security
Internet security is a tree branch of computer security specifically
related to the Internet, often involving browser security but also network
security on a more general level as it applies to other applications
or operating systems on the whole. Its objective is to establish rules
and measures to use against attacks over the Internet. The Internet
represents an insecure channel for exchanging information leadling to a
high risk of intrusion or fraud, such as phishing. Different methods have
been used to protect the transfer of data, inclucding encryption [4].
Robotics
Robotics is the branch of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering
and computer science that deals with the design, construction,
operation, and application of robots, as well as computer systems for
their control, sensory feedback, and information processing [6].
Artificial Intelligence
Artificial intelligence (Al) is the intelligence exhibited by machines
or software. It is an academic field of study which studies the goal
of creating intelligence. Major AI researchers and textbooks define
this field as *the study and design of intelligent agents°, [1] where an
intelligent agent is a system that perceives its environment and takes
actions that maximize its chances of success. John McCarthy, who coined

the term in 1955, defines it as “the science and engincering of making
intelligent machines.°[5]
Big Data
Big data is a broad term for data sets so large or complex that
traditional data processing applications are inadequate. Challenges
include analysis, capture, curation, search, sharing, storage, transfer,
visualization, and information privacy. The term often refers simply to
the use of predictive analytics or other certain advanced methods to
extract value from cdata, and seldom to a particular size of data set [2].
Internet of Things
The Internet of Things (IoT) is the network of physical objects or
"things" embecded with electronics, software, sensors and connectivity
to enable it to achieve greater value and service by exchanging data with
the manufacturer, operator and/or other connected devices. Each thing
is uniquely identifiable through its embedded computing system but is
able to interoperate within the existing Internet infrastructure [3].
Cloud Computing
Cloud computing is a computing term or metaphor that evolved in the
late 2000s, based on utility and consumption of computing resources.
Cloud computing involves deploying groups of remote servers and
software networks that allow centralized data storage and online access
to computer services or resources. Clouds can be classified as public,
private or hybrid [1].
