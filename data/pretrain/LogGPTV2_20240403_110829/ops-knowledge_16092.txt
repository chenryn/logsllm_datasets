User: How to install and configure Elasticsearch cluster?
Assistant: The steps to install and configure an Elasticsearch cluster are as follows: 1. Install Java First, make sure Java is installed on all nodes. Elasticsearch requires Java 8 or higher. 2. Download and unzip Elasticsearch Download the latest version of Elasticsearch from the official website of Elasticsearch. After the download is complete, unzip the file to the file system of each node. 3. Modify the configuration file Modify the configuration file on each node. Elasticsearch configuration files are located in the "config" subfolder of the unzipped folder. To ensure that nodes are all joined to the same cluster, the same cluster name needs to be specified in each node's configuration file. Edit the "elasticsearch.yml" file and add the following line: cluster.name: my_cluster_name You also need to assign a unique node name to identify this node within the cluster. In the same cluster, there cannot be the same node name. To give each node a unique node name, edit the "elasticsearch.yml" file and add the following line: node.name: node1 Note that the node name should be unique for each node. In addition, you can configure other settings of Elasticsearch, such as index storage location, log settings, etc. 4. Start and test the cluster Execute the following command on each node to start Elasticsearch: ./bin/elasticsearch Wait for a while, the Elasticsearch nodes should start joining the cluster. You can test that the cluster is running properly with the curl command or using a GUI tool such as Kibana. For example: curl http://localhost:9200/_cluster/state?pretty This will return information about the state of the cluster. This data should be the same no matter which node provided it. If you see the correct response, the cluster was successfully installed and configured.
