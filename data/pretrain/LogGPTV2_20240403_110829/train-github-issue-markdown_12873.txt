Back in January, it was documented that an API to set window shape would be
coming once an upstream bug was resolved. That bug was already "lower than
Priority 1" at the time.
I'm curious if it would be possible to make a setting in the interim to just
ignore all clicks and pass them through to whatever's underneath? I'd like to
make an overlay type program and would effectively like to say my window shape
is a 0x0 rectangle. In my case, I'd be fine with strictly Windows
compatibility.
