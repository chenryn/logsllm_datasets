**ATT&CK ID:** T1055.005  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Thread Local Storage (TLS) Callback Injection

**Description:**
Adversaries may inject malicious code into processes by leveraging thread local storage (TLS) callbacks. This technique allows them to evade process-based defenses and potentially elevate privileges. TLS callback injection involves executing arbitrary code within the address space of a separate, active process. By using TLS callbacks, attackers can achieve code execution in a manner that is less likely to be detected by security mechanisms that monitor for more traditional injection techniques.
