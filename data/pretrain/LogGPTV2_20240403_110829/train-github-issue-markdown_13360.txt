Hello,

I have observed an issue with the `HTTPAdapter` when using `pool_block=True`. Specifically, if a connection fails, it seems that the connection does not return to the pool. This can cause the session to get stuck.

To reproduce this issue, please follow these steps:

```python
import requests

# Create an HTTPAdapter with a maximum pool size of 1 and pool blocking enabled
adapter = requests.adapters.HTTPAdapter(pool_maxsize=1, pool_block=True)

# Mount the adapter to the session for HTTP requests
session = requests.Session()
session.mount("http://", adapter)

# Attempt to make a GET request to a non-existent server
try:
    response = session.get("http://localhost:12345")
except requests.exceptions.ConnectionError as e:
    print(f"Connection error: {e}")

# Try to make another GET request (this will hang)
response = session.get("http://localhost:12345")
```

In this example, the first `GET` request will fail due to a connection error (since the server at `localhost:12345` is not running). The second `GET` request will hang because the connection did not return to the pool after the failure.

Thank you,
[Your Name]
