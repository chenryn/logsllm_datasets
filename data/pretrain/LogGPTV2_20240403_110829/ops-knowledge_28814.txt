User: I m using shutil.copy from python to copy a list of files. But when i copy the files to /usr/lib/ location, i m getting permission denied as i need to be an administrator to do that.
So How could i copy files with admin permission or 
how could i get the admin password from the user to copy the files?
Ideas would be appreciated
Assistant: Start your program with a user that is allowed to write there. For example login to root first (su) or run the script with sudo myscript.py.
