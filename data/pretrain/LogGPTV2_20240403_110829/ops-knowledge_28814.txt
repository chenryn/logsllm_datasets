I am using `shutil.copy` in Python to copy a list of files. However, when I attempt to copy the files to the `/usr/lib/` directory, I receive a "permission denied" error because administrative privileges are required for this operation.

How can I copy files with administrative permissions, or how can I prompt the user to enter the administrator password to perform the file copy?

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

**Assistant:**

To resolve this issue, you should run your script with elevated privileges. Here are a couple of methods:

1. **Using `sudo`:** You can execute your script with `sudo`, which will prompt the user to enter their password if they have administrative privileges. For example:
   ```bash
   sudo python3 myscript.py
   ```

2. **Switching to the root user:** Alternatively, you can log in as the root user (using `su`) and then run your script. For example:
   ```bash
   su -
   python3 myscript.py
   ```

These approaches will allow your script to access and modify files in directories that require administrative permissions.
