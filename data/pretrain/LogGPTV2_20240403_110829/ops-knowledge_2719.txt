User: The following is 20 lines of a system log. Each line consists of a timestamp, log level, process id, relevant software component, and the log content. Think step-by-step and step and summarize this log chunk:

Assistant: This log chunk shows the startup of various software components on a system. It begins with klogd and irqbalance startup succeeding, followed by the system's totalpages, DMA zone, Normal zone, HighMem zone, and DMI version being reported. The kernel command line is then reported, followed by the CPU#0 being initialized and PID hash table entries being detected. The processor's frequency is then detected, followed by rpc.statd starting and nfslock succeeding. Finally, the log ends with the system using tsc for high-res timesource.
