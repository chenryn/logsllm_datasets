ABSTRACT
Denial of service (DoS) attacks continue to threaten the reliability
of networking systems. Previous approaches for protecting net-
works from DoS attacks are reactive in that they wait for an attack
to be launched before taking appropriate measures to protect the
network. This leaves the door open for other attacks that use more
sophisticated methods to mask their trafﬁc.
We propose an architecture called Secure Overlay Services (SOS)
that proactively prevents DoS attacks, geared toward supporting
Emergency Services or similar types of communication. The archi-
tecture is constructed using a combination of secure overlay tun-
neling, routing via consistent hashing, and ﬁltering. We reduce the
probability of successful attacks by (i) performing intensive ﬁlter-
ing near protected network edges, pushing the attack point perime-
ter into the core of the network, where high-speed routers can han-
dle the volume of attack trafﬁc, and (ii) introducing randomness
and anonymity into the architecture, making it difﬁcult for an at-
tacker to target nodes along the path to a speciﬁc SOS-protected
destination.
Using simple analytical models, we evaluate the likelihood that
an attacker can successfully launch a DoS attack against an SOS-
protected network. Our analysis demonstrates that such an archi-
tecture reduces the likelihood of a successful attack to minuscule
levels.

INTRODUCTION
In the immediate aftermath of 9/11 events in New York City,
the Internet was used to facilitate communication between family
members and friends, as the phone network was overwhelmed1. It
does not require a great leap of faith to imagine using the Internet as
a communication medium for crisis and emergency response teams.
In particular, the network could be used to carry communications
between widely dispersed “static” sites (e.g., various federal, state,
and city agencies) and (semi-) roaming stations and users. In such
an environment, the communication path between the various sites
and the emergency response teams (ERTs) needs to be kept clear
of interference such as denial of service (DoS) attacks: attacks that
attempt to overwhelm the processing or link capacity of the target
site (or routers that are topologically close) by saturating it (them)
with bogus packets. Such attacks on a network could seriously
disrupt the rescue and recovery effort at minimal cost and danger
to the attacker. Yet the Internet, both in its current form and in
the form that it will likely evolve into the future, will remain a
fundamentally open network. Thus, we cannot reasonably expect
any one entity to effectively police and control it.
A proposal to build a completely separate network is under con-
sideration by the US government (appropriately named “GovNet”).
Such a network would have a high deployment and maintenance
cost, and would likely fall behind the general-purpose Internet as
new technologies are discovered and deployed. The network secu-
rity community is also doubtful of the claims of increased security
that such a separate network would entail. It is therefore a worth-
while endeavor to consider building a secure infrastructure either
inside or upon the existing Internet.
In this paper, we address the problem of securing communica-
tion on top of today’s existing IP infrastructure from DoS attacks,
where the communication is between a pre-determined location and
users, located anywhere in the wide-area network, who have autho-
rization to communicate with that location. We focus our efforts on
protecting a site that stores information that is difﬁcult to replicate
due to security concerns or due to its dynamic nature. An example
is a database that maintains timely or conﬁdential information such
as building structure reports, intelligence, assignment updates, or
strategic information. We assume that there is a pre-determined
subset of clients scattered throughout the wide-area network who
require (and should have) access to this information. These users

work came to a standstill.
61in the ﬁeld (emergency workers, government agents, police, etc.)
should be able to access this information from any location (i.e.,
any IP address) within the wide area network, since it is not always
possible to predict their locations when emergencies strike.
We also assume that there is a set of users that want to prevent
access to this information, and will launch DoS attacks upon any
network points whose jamming will achieve this goal. The goal of
the attackers is to identify any “pinch” points in the communica-
tions substrate and render them inoperable by ﬂooding them with
large volumes of trafﬁc. An example of an obvious attack point is
the location (IP address) of the destination that is to be secured, or
the routers in its immediate network vicinity.
We should stress that our approach does not solve the general
DoS problem (e.g., the problem of distinguishing between good-
and bad-intentioned requests to a web server such as Google). We
are interested in classes of communication where both participants
are known to each other. While our work was motivated by the
ERT scenario, it is equally applicable to any other environment
where both parties have some form of pre-established trust rela-
tionship (e.g., telecommuting, corporate Intranets, subscribers to a
news website, etc.).
Previous approaches that address this problem are reactive: they
monitor trafﬁc at a target location, waiting for an attack to occur.
After the attack is identiﬁed, typically via analysis of trafﬁc patterns
and packet headers, ﬁlters are established in an attempt to block
the offenders. The main two problems with this approach are the
accuracy with which legitimate trafﬁc can be distinguished from the
DoS trafﬁc, and the robustness of the mechanism for establishing
ﬁlters deep enough in the network (away from the target) so that
the effects of the attack are minimized.
Our approach is proactive. In a nutshell, the portion of the net-
work immediately surrounding the target (location to be protected)
aggressively ﬁlters and blocks all incoming packets whose source
addresses are not “approved”. The small set of source addresses
(potentially as small as 2-3 addresses) that are “approved” at any
particular time is kept secret so that attackers cannot use them to
pass through the ﬁlter. These addresses are picked from among
those within a distributed set of nodes throughout the wide area
network, that form a secure overlay: any transmissions that wish
to traverse the overlay must ﬁrst be validated at entry points of the
overlay. Once inside the overlay, the trafﬁc is tunneled securely for
several hops along the overlay to the “approved” (and secret from
attackers) locations, which can then forward the validated trafﬁc
through the ﬁltering routers to the target. The two main principles
behind our design are: (i) elimination of communication “pinch”
points, which constitute attractive DoS targets, via a combination
of ﬁltering and overlay routing to obscure the identities of the sites
whose trafﬁc is permitted to pass through the ﬁlter, and (ii) the
ability to recover from random or induced failures within the for-
warding infrastructure or within the secure overlay nodes.
This paper proposes a preliminary approach to constructing this
forwarding service that we refer to as a Secure Overlay Service, or
SOS for short. We discuss how to design the overlay such that it
is secure with high probability, given attackers who have a large
but ﬁnite set of resources to perform the attacks. The attackers also
know the IP addresses of the nodes that participate in the overlay
and of the target that is to be protected, as well as the details of the
operation of protocols used to perform the forwarding. However,
we also assume that the attacker does not have unobstructed ac-
cess to the network core. That is, our model allows for the attacker
to take over an arbitrary (but ﬁnite) number of hosts, but only a
small number of routers. In particular, the attacker can bypass our
mechanism if they can take control of a router that lies in the path
between one of the “approved” overlay nodes and the target’s ﬁlter-
ing router: at that point, the attacker knows an IP address that will
be allowed to reach the target and can use that to launch the DoS
attack.
We feel that this assumption is justiﬁed since, if the attacker can
gain control of such a router, they can cut off the target’s commu-
nications directly, without the need to launch a DoS attack. Also,
it is more difﬁcult (but not impossible) to take control of a router
than an end-host or server, due to the limited number of potentially
exploitable services offered by the former. While routers offer very
attractive targets to hackers, there have been very few conﬁrmed
cases where take-over attacks have been successful.
Furthermore, we assume that the attacker cannot acquire sufﬁ-
cient resources to severely disrupt large portions of the backbone
itself (i.e., such that all paths to the target are congested).
Our architecture leverages heavily off of previous work on IP
security[4], IP router ﬁltering capabilities, and novel approaches to
routing in overlays[1] and peer-to-peer (P2P) networks[26, 6]. To
the extent possible, we strive to use existing systems and protocols,
rather than invent our own. Our resulting system is in some ways
similar to the Onion Routing architecture [20] used for anonymous
communications.
We perform a preliminary stochastic analysis using simple net-
working models to evaluate the likelihood that an attacker is able to
prevent communications to a particular target. We determine this
likelihood as a function of the aggregate bandwidth obtained by
an attacker through the exploitation of compromised systems. Our
analysis includes an examination of the capabilities of static attack-
ers who focus all their attack resources on a ﬁxed set of nodes, as
well as attackers who adjust their attacks to “chase after” the re-
pairs that the SOS system implements when it detects an attack. We
show that even attackers that are able to launch massive attacks are
very unlikely to prevent successful communication. For instance,
attackers that are able to launch attacks upon 50% of the nodes in
the overlay have roughly one chance in one thousand of stopping
a given communication from a client who can communicate access
the overlay through a small subset of overlay nodes.
The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. We review re-
lated work in Section 2. Section 3 describes the SOS Architecture,
whose resistance to attacks is evaluated in Section 4. Section 5 dis-
cusses implementation details, Section 6 provides a general discus-
sion of our results and future directions, and Section 7 concludes
the paper.
2. RELATED WORK
A fundamental design principle of the IP architecture is to keep
the functionality inside the core of the network simple, pushing as
much mechanism as possible to the network end-points. This prin-
ciple, commonly referred to as the “end-to-end principle”[22, 5],
has been the basic premise behind protocol design. However, as
has been demonstrated in the past few years [25, 10], such mecha-
nisms are inadequate in addressing the problem of DoS attacks.
It is trivial to abuse[23] or simply ignore congestion control mech-
anisms, and there are plenty of protocols that have no provision for
congestion control. Furthermore, no great technical sophistication
is required to launch one of these attacks. Even relatively large-
scale DoS attacks (Distributed DoS — DDoS)2 are not very dif-
ﬁcult to launch, given the lack of security in certain email clients
and the ability to cause arbitrary code to be executed by an email
recipient.
2For the remainder of this paper we will use the term “DoS” to
mean both single-origin and distributed DoS attacks.
62Unfortunately, as a result of its increased popularity and useful-
ness, the Internet contains both “interesting” targets and enough
malicious (or simply ignorant) users that DoS attacks are simply
not going to disappear on their own; indeed, although the press has
stopped reporting such incidents, recent studies have shown a sur-
prisingly high number of DoS attacks occurring around the clock
throughout the Internet [18]. Worse, the Internet is increasingly be-
ing used for time-critical applications (e.g., electricity production
monitoring and coordination between different generators).
The need to protect against or mitigate the effects of DoS attacks
has been recognized by both the commercial and research world.
Some work has been done toward achieving these goals, e.g., [12,
7, 24]. However, these mechanisms focus on detecting the source
of DoS attacks in progress and then countering them, typically by
“pushing” some ﬁltering rules on routers as far away from the tar-
get of the attack (and close to the sources) as possible. Thus, they
fall into this class of approaches that are reactive. The motiva-
tion behind such approaches has been twofold: ﬁrst, it is conceptu-
ally simple to introduce a protocol that will be used by a relatively
small subset of the nodes on the Internet (i.e., ISP routers), as op-
posed to requiring the introduction of new protocols that must be
deployed and used by end-systems. Second, these mechanisms are
fairly transparent to protocols, applications, and legitimate users.
Unfortunately, these reactive approaches by themselves are not
always adequate solutions:
(cid:15) Methods that ﬁlter trafﬁc by looking for known attack pat-
terns or statistical anomalies in trafﬁc patterns can be de-
feated by changing the attack pattern and masking the anoma-
lies that are sought by the ﬁlter. Furthermore, statistical ap-
proaches will likely ﬁlter out valid trafﬁc as well.
(cid:15) Since the Internet spans multiple administrative domains and
(legal) jurisdictions, it is often very difﬁcult, if not outright
impossible, to shut down an attack by contacting the admin-
istrator or the authorities closest to the source. In any case,
such action cannot be realistically delivered in a timely fash-
ion (often taking several hours).
(cid:15) Even if this were possible, it is often the case that the source
of the attack is not the real culprit but simply a node that has
been remotely subverted by a cracker. The attacker can just
start using another compromised node.
(cid:15) Using a “pushback”-like mechanism such as that described
in [12] to counter a DoS attack makes close cooperation among
different service providers necessary: since most attacks use
random source IP addresses (and since ingress ﬁltering is not
widely used), the only reliable packet ﬁeld that can be used
for ﬁltering is the destination IP address (of the target). If
ﬁlters can only be pushed “halfway” through the network
between the target and the sources of the attack, the target
runs the risk of voluntarily cutting off or adversely impact-
ing (e.g., by rate-limiting) its communications with the rest of
the Internet. The accuracy of such ﬁltering mechanisms im-
proves dramatically as the ﬁlters are “pushed” closer to the
actual source(s) of the attack. Thus, it will be necessary for
providers to allow other providers, or even end-network ad-
ministrators, to install ﬁlters on their routers. Apart from the
very realistic possibility of abuse, it is questionable whether
such collaboration can be achieved to the degree necessary.
The same concerns hold for the case of collaborative action
by the ISPs: even easy to implement mechanisms such as
ingress ﬁltering, that could reduce or even eliminate spoofed-
address DoS attacks, are still not in wide use. We believe
it is rather unrealistic to expect that cooperative providers
would even establish static ﬁlters to allow legitimate (paying)
clients to tunnel through their infrastructure with any assur-
ance of quality of service, and much less so for the case of
mobile or remote clients (as may be the case for emergency
teams).
Another approach to mitigating DoS attacks against information
carriers is to massively replicate the content being secured around
the entire network. To prevent access to the replicated information,
an attacker must attack all replication points throughout the entire
network — a task that is considerably more difﬁcult than attack-
ing a small number of, often co-located, servers. Replication is
a promising means to preserve information that is relatively static,
such as news articles. However, there are several reasons why repli-
cation is not always an ideal solution. For instance, the information
may require frequent updates complicating large-scale coherency
(especially during DoS attacks), or may be dynamic by its very na-
ture (e.g., a live audio or video stream). Another concern is the
security of the stored information: engineering a highly-replicated
solution without “leaks” of information is a challenging endeavor.
Thus, a different approach is needed in protecting the communi-
cations of parties involved in a critical task from the effects of DoS
attacks.
3. ARCHITECTURE DESCRIPTION
The goal of the SOS architecture is to allow communication be-
tween a conﬁrmed user and a target. By conﬁrmed, we mean that
the target has given prior permission to this user. Typically, this
means that the user’s packets must be authenticated and authorized
by the SOS infrastructure before trafﬁc is allowed to ﬂow between
the user through the overlay to the target. We shall discuss in Sec-
tion 5 how this can be efﬁciently achieved for a large collection of
SOS nodes and users. While we focus on the communication to a
single target, the architecture is easily extended to simultaneously
protect unicast communications destined to different targets. Both
peers can use the SOS infrastructure to protect bidirectional com-
