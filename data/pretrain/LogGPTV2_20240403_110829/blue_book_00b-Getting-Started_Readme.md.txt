## IMPORTANT: DevOps Kit (AzSK) is being sunset by end of FY21. More details [here](../ReleaseNotes/AzSKSunsetNotice.md)
----------------------------------------------
> The Secure DevOps Kit for Azure (AzSK) was created by the Core Services Engineering & Operations (CSEO) division at Microsoft, to help accelerate Microsoft IT's adoption of Azure. We have shared AzSK and its documentation with the community to provide guidance for rapidly scanning, deploying and operationalizing cloud resources, across the different stages of DevOps, while maintaining controls on security and governance.
AzSK is not an official Microsoft product â€“ rather an attempt to share Microsoft CSEO's best practices with the community..
# Getting started with the Secure DevOps Kit for Azure!
If you have just installed the Secure DevOps Kit for Azure (a.k.a. AzSK) and are not familiar with 
its functionality, then you can get started with the 2 most basic use cases of AzSK by going through 
the following getting started guides:
- [Scan the security of your subscription](GettingStarted_SubscriptionSecurity.md)
- [Scan the security of your cloud application](GettingStarted_AzureServiceSecurity.md)  
Thereafter, you can explore individual features further using the table of contents below which has 
pointers to full help on individual features by feature area.
> **Note:** If you have not installed the DevOps Kit yet, follow the instructions in the [installation guide](../00a-Setup/Readme.md) and then come back here.
> **PowerShell Tips for AzSK:** 
> If you are new to PowerShell, then you will find several useful tips in our [PowerShell tips for new AzSK Users](GettingStarted_PowerShellTipsAzSK.md) guide 
> handy to accelerate your initial learning curve for PowerShell competencies needed to use AzSK effectively.
The overall set of features in the Secure DevOps Kit for Azure are organized by the 6 areas as shown 
in the table below:  
|Feature Area | Secure DevOps Kit Feature|

## Complete list of AzSK commands
> **Note**: Most of the AzSK cmdlets support 3 letter acronyms (e.g., GRS, ICA, UCA, etc.). You can invoke cmdlets using these *after* AzSK has been imported in the session. So, to use any of these aliases, make sure you run 'ipmo AzSK' as the first thing in a new PS/ISE console window ('ipmo' itself is an alias for 'import-module'). Apart from cmdlets, parameters also have associated aliases. Those are documented in the individual cmdlet documentation. 
> For a quick reference on aliases, you can run 'get-alias | findstr -i AzSk' within a PS/ISE console after running 'ipmo AzSK'.
