### 3.1 Data Collection and Market Selection

Our study includes data from four major US cellular carriers—Sprint, Verizon, T-Mobile, and AT&T—along with two large South Korean carriers, SK Telecom and LG U+. The distribution of clients across these operators is detailed in Table 1. These markets were selected due to their extensive LTE coverage and high volume of 4G traffic [12]. Our measurements span a five-month period from March 1, 2014, to August 1, 2014.

In total, our dataset comprises over 280,000 individual experiments, including more than 8.1 million DNS resolutions and 2.4 million pings, traceroutes, and HTTP GET requests from mobile devices.

### 3.2 Experiment Description

Each device conducted the specified experiment approximately once per hour in the background. To account for the performance characteristics of different radio states in LTE devices [11], each experiment began with a bootstrap ping to wake up the radio and mitigate any state promotion delay. Our experiment scripts are designed to run continuously and as quickly as possible to maintain the radio in a high power state.

The experiments included the following components:

- **DNS Resolutions:** For nine popular mobile domains (see Table 2), which were chosen based on their popularity and the use of DNS-based load balancing and server selection. DNS resolutions were performed using both the locally configured resolver and public DNS services such as Google DNS and OpenDNS.
- **Ping and Traceroute Probes:** Conducted to each replica server IP address returned from the DNS resolutions. An HTTP GET request was also sent to each replica IP for the index page at that address.
- **Resolver IP Address Resolution:** The IP addresses of the client's resolvers were determined by querying an authoritative DNS (ADNS) for a subdomain of our research group’s website. This was done for both the locally configured resolver and public DNS resolvers like Google DNS and OpenDNS.
- **Additional Probes:** Ping and traceroute probes were conducted to each IP address returned by our ADNS. For the device's locally configured resolver, additional probes were run to the IP address configured on the device and the one returned by our ADNS, as they differed in all measured cases.

### 3.3 Isolating Mobile Context and Performance Issues

To mitigate the impact of device context and performance variations in network measurements from mobile devices [8], we used ping latency as a stable metric. Previous work by Gember et al. [8] demonstrated that ping latency is more stable and less affected by changes in user context compared to throughput-based metrics like page load time.

Modern mobile devices support multiple radio technologies (e.g., LTE, HSPA, UMTS), each with distinct performance characteristics. For example, seven different radio technologies were reported within both AT&T and T-Mobile networks, each showing varying performance. Focusing on LTE helps control for these variations, as LTE provides lower and more stable radio access latency compared to previous wireless technologies [11]. Figure 3 illustrates the performance and stability of LTE connections.

**Figure 3: DNS Resolution Times for Different Radio Technologies**
- **US Carriers:**
  - Sprint
  - Verizon
  - T-Mobile
  - AT&T
- **South Korean Carriers:**
  - LG U+
  - SK Telecom

These figures show distinct performance bands for different radio technologies, with newer generations offering lower resolution times. For instance, there is a consistent performance differential of around 50ms at the median for 4G technologies like LTE compared to 3G technologies like EHRPD and EVDO Rev. A in both Sprint and Verizon CDMA networks. 2G technologies like 1xRTT, however, take nearly 1 second to complete a domain name resolution.

### 4. Cellular DNS Characterization

This section presents the results of our characterization of the DNS infrastructure of four major US and two South Korean cellular providers. We found an indirect DNS resolver structure, with separate client-facing and external-facing resolvers, in all the cellular networks we investigated. The performance of cellular DNS resolution under LTE is comparable to that of current residential broadband connections. We also examined the opacity of cellular LDNS resolvers, finding that cellular network opaqueness extends to their DNS resolvers, both in their external reachability and in their inconsistent mapping to clients.

#### 4.1 Cellular DNS Infrastructure

Our findings reveal different DNS configurations within each cellular provider. While all providers employ indirect resolution techniques, their policies differ in terms of the number of client-facing and external-facing DNS resolvers and the consistency of pairings. Table 3 summarizes the DNS infrastructure of each operator.

**Table 3: Number of LDNS Pairs and Consistency**

| Provider       | Client-Facing | External-Facing | Pairs | Consistency % |
|----------------|---------------|-----------------|-------|---------------|
| Sprint         | 19            | 27              | 3     | 64.1          |
| Verizon        | 2             | 2               | 1     | 100           |
| T-Mobile       | 3             | 32              | 32    | 7.3           |
| AT&T           | 5             | 43              | 43    | 12            |
| SK Telecom     | 2             | 24              | 24    | 12            |
| LG U+          | 5             | 80              | 80    | 6.2           |

We observed the presence of LDNS pools within the networks of Sprint, SK Telecom, and LG U+. In these cases, all resolvers are public IP addresses, and each client-facing resolver is paired with multiple external resolver addresses. For Sprint, the mappings between client and external resolvers are fairly consistent, occurring over 60% of the time.

Anycasted DNS was found in AT&T and T-Mobile networks, with a limited number of configured DNS resolver addresses on client devices and a significantly larger number of publicly visible addresses. For example, a single AT&T address (172.26.38.1) maps to 40 external resolver addresses.

Verizon maintained a 100% consistency between client and external facing resolvers, though the external resolvers did not respond to probes. Each LDNS pair within Verizon exists in different ASes: 6167 for client-facing resolvers and 22394 for external-facing resolvers.

#### 4.2 Cellular Resolver Distance

The network distance between clients and their corresponding resolver infrastructure is crucial for DNS resolution performance. To capture this, clients issued ping probes to the sets of resolvers during each experiment. Figure 4 shows the cumulative distribution of latencies to clients' configured client-facing and external-facing resolvers. In some cases, both resolvers have nearly equal latencies, indicating identical or collocated resolvers, as seen with SK Telecom. For T-Mobile, Sprint, and AT&T, there is a noticeable distance between resolvers, revealing a physical hierarchy.

**Figure 4: Client Latency to Internal and External Resolver Locations**

  - T-Mobile

  - LG U+

Due to widespread tunneling (e.g., VPN or MPLS) within each cellular network, structural information such as hop distance gathered by traceroutes was often irrelevant.

#### 4.3 Cellular DNS Performance

The DNS performance under LTE is relatively consistent and comparable to wired broadband. Figures 5 and 6 present the CDFs of resolution times for the US and South Korean carriers. Median resolution times range from 30 to 50 ms, which is comparable to wired Internet performance [1] for the lower 50th percentile.

Both South Korean carriers and T-Mobile exhibit bimodal behavior above their 50th percentile, while the remaining operators show a long tail of resolution times above the 80th percentile. To measure the impact of resolver cache on resolution time tails, we conducted back-to-back queries and measured the difference between the first and second DNS queries. The results, presented in Figure 7, show that cache misses account for additional delays approximately 20% of the time, similar to the bimodal behavior seen in Figures 5 and 6.
