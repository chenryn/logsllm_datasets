To explore the solution space, we have developed two distinct testing frameworks: one for ingress traffic and another for egress traffic. These frameworks are designed to isolate the effects of each direction, ensuring that when training an ingress model, egress traffic traverses a full-fidelity network, and vice versa for an egress model.

The structure of these testing frameworks mirrors that of the small-scale simulation described in Section 5.1. In this setup, two clusters are configured to communicate with each other. One cluster remains at full-fidelity, while the other is converted into a specialized testing cluster. For detailed diagrams, refer to Figure 15, which illustrates the specialized testing clusters.

The isolation of the two traffic directions is contingent on the model being tested. For instance, in the ingress testing cluster (Figure 15a), incoming traffic passes through the model before reaching the hosts, while outgoing traffic flows through the full-fidelity network. However, simply feeding egress traffic into the full-fidelity component would yield inaccurate results, as egress traffic competes with local traffic, which in turn competes with ingress traffic. To address this, we duplicate ingress packets and continue to feed them, along with local traffic, into the full-fidelity cluster, dropping them in favor of the model's results when applicable. A similar process is employed when testing an egress model.

### Hybrid Mimic Clusters
- **Ingress (Figure 15a)**: Ingress traffic flows through the model, while egress and internal traffic flow through the full-fidelity network.
- **Egress (Figure 15b)**: Egress traffic flows through the model, while ingress and internal traffic flow through the full-fidelity network.

### Impact of Window Size on Modeling Accuracy and Speed
- **Training Loss Descent (Figure 16a)**: A larger window size (up to the BDP of the network, around 12 packets) improves training accuracy, but with diminishing returns.
- **Training Latency (Figure 16b)**: Larger window sizes increase training time, suggesting that a window size equal to the BDP of the network strikes a good balance between accuracy and speed.

### Validation and Inference
- **Validation Loss Descent (Figure 17a)**: Similar trends to training loss, with a 2-packet window performing significantly better than a 1-packet window, and a 5-packet window performing even better.
- **Inference Latency (Figure 17b)**: Inference latency increases with window size, from 70 μs for 1 packet to over 150 μs for 20 packets.

### Throughput and RTT Comparison
- **Throughput (Figure 18)**: MimicNet closely matches the throughput of real simulations for Homa, DCTCP, TCP Vegas, and TCP Westwood.
- **RTT (Figure 19)**: MimicNet also accurately predicts RTT distributions, with TCP Westwood having the highest 90th percentile latency and DCTCP the lowest.

### Heavier Network Loads
- **FCT Estimation (Figure 20)**: MimicNet maintains high accuracy and completes execution 10.4× faster than full simulations under heavier loads (90% bisection bandwidth).

### Additional Simulations
- **Latency/Throughput (Figures 21 and 22)**: Simulation length has little impact on relative speeds, with MimicNet outperforming full simulations in both latency and throughput.

### Compute Consumption
- **FLOPs (Figure 23)**: MimicNet shows higher computational load due to GPU usage, but becomes more efficient than full simulations in large networks (e.g., 128 clusters).

### Future Directions
- **Model Reuse and Retraining**: Models can be reused across different scales, but retraining may be necessary if training data or steps change.
- **Flow Modeling**: Co-flow modeling is a potential area for improvement, as it can enhance the accuracy of evaluating systems like MapReduce and BSP-style data processing.

By addressing these aspects, MimicNet can provide fast and accurate performance estimates for data center networks, making it a valuable tool for network simulation and analysis.
