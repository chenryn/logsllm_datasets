User: I am trying to install the pyperclip module for Python 3.6 on Windows (32 bit). I have looked at various documentations (Python documentation, pypi.python.org and online courses) and they all said the same thing. 
1) Install and update pip
I downloaded get-pip.py from python.org and it ran immediately, so pip should be updated. 
2) Use the command python -m pip install SomePackage
Okay here is where I'm having issues. Everywhere says to run this in the command line, or doesn't specify a place to run it. 
I ran this in the command prompt: python -m pip install pyperclip. But I got the error message "'python' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file. 
If I run it in Python 3.6, it says pip is an invalid syntax. Running it in IDLE gives me the same message.
I have no idea where else to run it. I have the pyperclip module in my python folder. It looks like a really simple problem, but I have been stuck on this for ages!
Assistant: You need to add the location of the python.exe to your $PATH variable. This depends on your installation location. In my case it is C:\Anaconda3. The default is C:\Python as far as I know.
To edit your path variable you can do the following thing. Go to your Control Panel then search for system. You should see something like: "Edit the system environment variables". Click on this and then click on environment variables in the panel that opened. There you have a list of system variables. You should now look for the Path variable. Now click edit and add the Python path at the end. Make sure that you added a semicolon before adding the path to not mess with your previous configuration.
