(1) PHISHING DETECTION EXPERIMENT RESULTS 
In this section, we present the phishing experiment results. 
We first report the raw analysis results, and then interpret and 
discuss all of the findings. 
In  the  phishing  task,  participants  were  asked  to  make  a 
decision  as  to  whether  a  snapshot  of  a  website  presented  to 
them was real or fake. The participants could be looking at the 
website  address  or  the  symbols  or  logos  on  the  snapshot  to 
make  their  decision.  During  this  task  (in  contrast  with 
fixation),  we  found  statistically  significantly  increased  brain 
activity  in  the  bilateral  frontoparietal  network  along  with 
activation in bilateral occipital areas (p = 0.001; cluster size = 
64  mm3  determined  by  Monte  Carlo  simulations  to  be

Impulsive 
individuals  may  seek  immediate  gratification  and  may  make 
quick  decisions  without  much  thought.  Such  behavior  can 
affect  online  computer  security  behavior.  The  present  study 
found an inverse relationship between impulsivity and MPFC 
activity  during  real  or  fake  phishing  decisions  (Figure  6). 
Evidence 
suggest  MPFC’s 
executive/regulatory  function  in  that  it  mediates  competing 
and conflicting cognitive operations and scenarios [27, 28, 29, 
30,  31].  Studies  involving  animal  models  suggest  a  pivotal 
role  of  MPFC  in  impulsive  decision-making  [32].  Functional 
MRI  studies  of  delay  discounting  have  found 
inverse 
correlation  between  participants’ 
impulsive  choice  of 
decisions  and  activity  in  regions  like  MPFC  [33,  34].  Delay 
discounting  refers  to  giving  future  consequences  less  weight 
relative to more immediate consequences (e.g., [35]). In other 
words, delay discounting can be construed as the tendency to 
choose  a  smaller,  sooner  reward  over  a  larger,  later  reward. 
Similar  finding  of  inverse  correlation  in  the  present  study 
suggests the conflict and difficulty involved in making real or 
fake  decisions  during 
impulsive 
individuals.

(2) MALWARE WARNINGS EXPERIMENT RESULTS 
In  this  section,  we  present  the  results  from  our  malware 
warnings  experiment.  Similar  to  the  phishing  detection 
presentation, we first report the raw results and then interpret 
and discuss all of our findings. 
To  recall,  in  the  malware  warnings  task,  a  section  of  a 
news item (abstract) was presented to the participants. As the 
participants read the  news item, a  message popped up on the

regions  include  left  middle  and  superior  temporal  gyri  (LMTG/LSTG),  left 
inferior  frontal  gyrus  (LIFG),  bilateral  inferior  parietal  (LIPL/RIPL),  and

and middle temporal (RMTG)

The  warning  and  non-warning  conditions  showed  more 
activity  compared  to  reading  the  abstracts  of  the  news  items. 
Comprehending  warning, 
to  abstract,  elicited 
statistically significant increase in activation in several regions 
of the right hemisphere, such as the RIPL, RMTG/RSTG, and 
cuneus  (see  Figure  8).  Processing  non-warning  pop-ups, 
relative to news item abstracts, also elicited similar patterns of 
activation,  albeit  with  some  differences.  There  was  bilateral 
activation in  middle/superior temporal cortex in this contrast. 
In  addition,  the  right  parietal  activation  was  relatively  more 
anterior, in the postcentral gyrus.

 Interpretation and Discussion (Malware Warnings):  
Language  comprehension  is  a  critical  component  in  a 
user’s  online  interactions.  In  this  study,  participants  had  to 
read  several  news  items  and  make  appropriate  responses  to 
malware  warnings  (and  non-warnings).  Reading  the  news 
items as  well as reading  warnings generated significant brain 
activity in regions such as the LIFG and LMTG/LSTG (Figure 
7). This activation pattern provides further evidence of the role 
of 
language 
comprehension (see [36, 37, 38]). The LIFG, in particular, has 
been implicated in the unification of lexical information stored 
in the temporal cortex [39]. Activation in these areas suggests 
that  the  participants  in  the  present  study  were  going  through 
the warnings to understand the conveyed message and make a 
decision.
