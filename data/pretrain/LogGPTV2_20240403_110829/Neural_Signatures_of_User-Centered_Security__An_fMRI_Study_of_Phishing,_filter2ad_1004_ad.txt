### 1. Phishing Detection Experiment Results

In this section, we present the results of the phishing detection experiment. We first report the raw analysis results and then interpret and discuss our findings.

#### Task Description
Participants were asked to determine whether a snapshot of a website was real or fake. They could use the website address, symbols, or logos on the snapshot to make their decision.

#### Findings
During the phishing task (as opposed to fixation), we observed statistically significant increases in brain activity in the bilateral frontoparietal network and bilateral occipital areas (p = 0.001; cluster size = 64 mmÂ³, determined by Monte Carlo simulations to be equivalent to a family-wise error corrected threshold of p < 0.05).

The activation patterns showed that non-warning conditions and abstracts elicited more activity compared to warning conditions (see Figure 7). This suggests that the presence of warnings may influence the cognitive processes involved in phishing detection.

#### Personality Traits and Brain Activity
Another key finding from this study is the relationship between personality traits, such as impulsivity, and brain activity during the phishing task. Impulsive individuals tend to seek immediate gratification and make quick decisions without much thought, which can affect online computer security behavior.

Our study found an inverse relationship between impulsivity and MPFC activity during real or fake phishing decisions (Figure 6). The MPFC is known to mediate competing and conflicting cognitive operations [27-31]. Studies involving animal models suggest a pivotal role of the MPFC in impulsive decision-making [32]. Functional MRI studies of delay discounting have also found an inverse correlation between participants' impulsive choices and MPFC activity [33, 34]. Delay discounting refers to the tendency to give future consequences less weight relative to more immediate consequences, often leading to the choice of a smaller, sooner reward over a larger, later reward [35].

The similar inverse correlation in our study suggests that impulsive individuals face greater conflict and difficulty when making real or fake decisions during the phishing task.

### 2. Malware Warnings Experiment Results

In this section, we present the results from our malware warnings experiment. Similar to the phishing detection experiment, we first report the raw results and then interpret and discuss our findings.

#### Task Description
Participants were presented with a section of a news item. As they read the news, a message popped up, either a warning or a non-warning. Participants had to read the news items and respond appropriately to the warnings.

#### Findings
Compared to reading the abstracts of the news items, both warning and non-warning conditions showed more activity in several brain regions (see Figure 8). Comprehending warnings, relative to abstracts, elicited statistically significant increases in activation in several right hemisphere regions, such as the RIPL, RMTG/RSTG, and cuneus. Processing non-warning pop-ups also elicited similar patterns of activation, but with some differences. There was bilateral activation in the middle/superior temporal cortex, and the right parietal activation was relatively more anterior, in the postcentral gyrus.

#### Interpretation and Discussion
Language comprehension is a critical component of a user's online interactions. In this study, participants had to read several news items and respond appropriately to malware warnings (and non-warnings). Reading the news items and warnings generated significant brain activity in regions such as the LIFG and LMTG/LSTG (Figure 7). This activation pattern provides further evidence of the role of these regions in different aspects of language comprehension [36-38]. The LIFG, in particular, has been implicated in the unification of lexical information stored in the temporal cortex [39]. Activation in these areas suggests that participants were carefully processing the warnings to understand the conveyed message and make a decision.

#### Impulsivity and Brain Activity
There is a negative relationship between impulsivity and brain activity in the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and precuneus (Figure 10). This finding aligns with previous research, suggesting that impulsive individuals may struggle with the cognitive demands of comprehending and responding to malware warnings.

### Conclusion
Our findings provide insights into the neural mechanisms underlying phishing detection and malware warning comprehension. The involvement of the frontoparietal network, occipital areas, and specific language-related regions highlights the complex cognitive processes at play. Additionally, the relationship between impulsivity and brain activity underscores the importance of considering individual differences in online security behavior.
