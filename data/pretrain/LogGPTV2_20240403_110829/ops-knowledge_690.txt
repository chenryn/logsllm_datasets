User: I have a simple .exe that needs to be running continuously.
Unfortunately, sometimes it crashes unexpectedly, and there's nothing that can be done for this.
I'm thinking of like a C# program that scans the running application tree on a timer and if the process stops running it re-launches it... ?  Not sure how to do that though....
Any other ideas?
Assistant: The first solution would be to fix your EXE, so it does not crash. If you can not fix it now, you probably need to add exception handling, so you can catch the exception, and not close the EXE.
Second solution is to write simple guard programm that will start your simple .exe and will monitor specific process handle. It will restart your program when it closes.
