  * VSCode Version: 1.0.0
  * OS Version: Windows 10
Steps to Reproduce:
  1. Create a simple html component (Angular, Aurelia, etc.) file. For example: "my-component.html"
  2. Set its content to something like: "``" all on one line.
  3. Press Alt+Shift+F to format the code.
  4. Nothing happens.
Notes:
  * Formatting other file types like TS, JS, and C# works fine.
  * Formatting full HTML files works. For example, "``" formats fine.
  * Code successfully recognizes the "Language Mode" for the component file but still doesn't work.
