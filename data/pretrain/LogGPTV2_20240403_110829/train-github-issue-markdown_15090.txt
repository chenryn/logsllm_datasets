### Superset version
0.25.5
### Expected results
I need to set a default value in a filterbox which will then filter non-immune
slices on the dashboard the filterbox is added to. I know there is an option
to set a filter in a filterbox and then save the dashboard which will retain
the filtering when selected. This option does not work when the filter choices
in the filterbox may differ for each user. There is no property in the
filterbox slice builder to set a default value. I have thought of adding to
Dashboard.jsx a new property in formData which may then be leveraged in
utils.py when the query is created similar to what extra_filters does now;
however, I have not found a means to enforce the use of this "default_filter"
only for the first time the dashboard is selected. As for as a default value,
I would just use the first value in the list of filter choices. I was able to
set a default value in a filterbox by changing the value property in the
OnPasteSelect in filter_box.jsx; the issue here is that it does not propagate
to the other slices on the dashboard making it ineffective.
Is there a way of knowing when a dashboard is initially selected by a user?  
Can setting a default value in the filterbox be added as a new property which
is perhaps picked up by extra_filters?
Any thoughts or ideas would be appreciated.
