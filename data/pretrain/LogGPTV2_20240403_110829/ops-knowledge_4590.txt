User: I use Sublime Text and am using the terminal to run my code.
I would prefer to use the Python Shell to run my code, as it has color and is not so hard to look at.
Is there any easy way to do this other than saving then opening in IDLE?
Assistant: You can use ctrl-b to run your python in sublime. If you want to use a different interpreter you can customise under Tools -> Build System
