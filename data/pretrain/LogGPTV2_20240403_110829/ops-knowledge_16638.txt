I understand that you have Python 2.7.11 installed in your home directory and need to compile the YouCompleteMe plugin, which requires `python-dev`. However, the global Python version on your system is 2.7.11, and installing `python-dev` via `apt-get` would provide headers for Python 2.6, causing incompatibility.

You have already re-compiled Python 2.7.11 with the `--enable-shared` flag, but you are unsure how to add the compiled library and header files to the system's default search path.

To manually install the locally compiled Python 2.7.11 library and header files, follow these steps:

1. **Locate the Compiled Files:**
   - The compiled Python 2.7.11 should have generated the necessary `.so` (shared object) files and header files. These are typically located in the `lib` and `include` directories within the build directory.

2. **Copy the Shared Library:**
   - Copy the shared library file (e.g., `libpython2.7.so`) to the system's library directory, such as `/usr/local/lib` or `/usr/lib`.
     ```sh
     sudo cp /path/to/your/build/libpython2.7.so /usr/local/lib/
     ```

3. **Update the Library Cache:**
   - Run `ldconfig` to update the system's dynamic linker cache.
     ```sh
     sudo ldconfig
     ```

4. **Copy the Header Files:**
   - Copy the header files to the system's include directory, such as `/usr/local/include/python2.7` or `/usr/include/python2.7`.
     ```sh
     sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/include/python2.7
     sudo cp -r /path/to/your/build/include/python2.7/* /usr/local/include/python2.7/
     ```

5. **Set Environment Variables:**
   - If needed, you can set the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable to include the directory where the shared library is located.
     ```sh
     export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
     ```

6. **Verify Installation:**
   - Verify that the correct version of the Python development files is being used by checking the version of the headers and libraries.
     ```sh
     python2.7 -c "import sys; print(sys.version)"
     ```

By following these steps, you should be able to manually install the locally compiled Python 2.7.11 library and header files, making them available for compiling the YouCompleteMe plugin.
