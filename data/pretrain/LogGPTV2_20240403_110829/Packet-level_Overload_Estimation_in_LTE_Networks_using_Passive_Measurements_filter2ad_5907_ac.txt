### 15-Fold Increase in Reject Messages

Figure 3(c) shows a 15-fold increase in the number of reject messages compared to Figure 3(d). This significant rise in reject messages clearly indicates an increase in cellular network utilization.

### 5.2 Phi (Φ) Measure

To better understand variations in overload levels, we examine a normalized second-order metric, the Phi (Φ) measure. The Phi measure is defined as the ratio of the number of RRCConnectionReject messages to the number of RRCConnectionRequest messages. We again use a bin size of 30 seconds. This measure provides an indication of the severity of overload, reflecting the percentage of new users who were unable to connect to the network. In future studies, we aim to analyze the temporal variation in Phi (or the number of new users rejected) to quantify the maximum acceptable load threshold in eNodeBs. As expected, there is a considerable difference between overloaded datasets (i.e., SPG and CSR) and their respective baselines. Figure 4(a) shows that Phi is three times higher than in Figure 4(b). This difference is even more pronounced in Figure 4(c), where Phi is more than seven times that in Figure 4(d). This trend is consistent with our observations in Section 5.1 and suggests a relationship between the number of UEs (# uniqueUeIDs) and the tendency towards network overload.

### 5.3 Average WaitTime

When comparing the average waitTime across datasets in Figure 5, we observe that SPD and CSR have longer waitTimes than their baselines. Specifically, AT&T performs worse in SPD, closely followed by T-Mobile. In CSR, T-Mobile performs slightly worse than AT&T. Verizon, however, consistently shows lower waitTimes across all datasets. Note that the sample sizes of these distributions are proportional to the number of reject messages, as shown in Figure 3. Despite this, all telecom providers exhibit longer waitTimes during increased traffic demand.

The longer waitTimes in SPD and CSR can be attributed to the high proportion of UEs (# uniqueUeIDs) in the given location. If the number of UEs is large enough to cause overload, eNodeBs may engage proprietary mitigation schemes, one of which is increasing the waitTime. This confirms our hypothesis that these messages and parameter values can be used to infer overload. The comparison supports our earlier results based on RRCConnectionReject messages, and average waitTime serves as an additional indicator of overloaded eNodeBs.

### 5.4 Omega (Ω) Measure

In addition to reject messages and their corresponding waitTimes, the cellBarred status is a crucial parameter that can indicate overload in an eNodeB. The cellBarred status, transmitted within a System Information Block 1 (SIB1) message, indicates that the UE is not allowed to camp on a particular cell. We hypothesize that during overload conditions, cells may initiate load balancing by systematically preventing UEs from anchoring on them. To evaluate this theory, we analyze cellBarred messages to compare the percentage of these messages in our datasets.

The Omega (Ω) metric measures the ratio of cellBarred signals transmitted to the number of SIB1 frames received, using a bin size of 30 seconds. This second-order metric helps establish a correlation between Omega and overload. Figure 6 depicts the variation in Omega across all datasets. We observe a 20% increase in SPD and CSR datasets over their respective baselines, indicating a relationship between cell barring signals and overload, confirming our hypothesis. Interestingly, each mobile network operator (i.e., T-Mobile, Verizon, and AT&T) has comparable Omega values in SPD and CSR, despite different trends in Figures 3 and 4. This suggests that the inherent load-handling capacity of eNodeBs and the density of served users differ, leading to a preference for consistently rejecting incoming connection requests rather than broadcasting unavailability, regardless of proprietary overload mitigation schemes.

### 6. Conclusion

In this work, we propose a novel method to assess overload in nearby LTE eNodeBs using off-the-shelf hardware and without requiring cooperation from the cellular provider. Our analysis provides compelling evidence that messages broadcast by the eNodeB can be used to detect cellular overload through passive monitoring. Future work will explore how passive overload inference can be leveraged in a system for automated overload mapping using ground-based data collection and Unmanned Aircraft Systems, independent of collaboration from a cellular provider. Such tools can be valuable for regulators and policymakers, enabling targeted deployment of alternative communication channels.
