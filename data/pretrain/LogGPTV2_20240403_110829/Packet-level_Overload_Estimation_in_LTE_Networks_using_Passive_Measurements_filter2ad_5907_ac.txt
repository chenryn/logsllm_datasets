fifteen-fold increase in reject messages in Figure 3(c) as compared
to Figure 3(d). This significant increase in reject messages is a clear
indication of an increase in cellular network utilization.
5.2 Phi (Φ) Measure
To better understand how overload levels vary, we examine a nor-
malized second-order metric. We define the Phi (Φ) measure as the
ratio of the number of RRCConnectionReject messages to the num-
ber of RRCConnectionRequest messages. Once again, we choose a
bin size of 30 seconds. The Phi measure provides an indication of
the severity of overload, as it reflects the percentage of new users
who were unable to connect to the network. In future studies, we
wish to examine the temporal variation in Phi (or the number of
new users that were rejected) in order to quantify the maximum
acceptable load threshold in eNodeBs. As expected, there is a con-
siderable difference between overloaded datasets (i.e., SPG and CSR)
and their respective baselines. Figure 4(a) shows that Phi is as much
as three times that in Figure 4(b). This difference is even more pro-
nounced in Figure 4(c), where Phi is more than seven times that in
Figure 4(d). This trend is similar to what we observed in Section 5.1.
It is also indicative of the relationship between the number of UEs
(# uniqueUeIDs) to the tendency towards network overload, as is
expected.

5.3 Average waitTime
When we compare the average waitTime across datasets in Figure
5, we observe that SPD and CSR have longer waitTimes than their
baselines. We also see that AT&T performs worse in SPD, closely
followed by T-Mobile. In CSR, T-Mobile appears to perform slightly
worse than AT&T. Verizon, however, shows lower waitTime in all
of the datasets. Note that the sample sizes of these distributions
are proportional to the number of reject messages, as shown in
Figure 3. Nevertheless, all of the telecom providers transmit longer
waitTimes during increases in traffic demand.
Longer waitTime in SPD and CSR is perhaps explained by the
high proportion of UEs (# uniqueUeIDs) in the given location. If
the magnitude of UEs is great enough to result in overload, eN-
odeBs start to curtail overload conditions by engaging proprietary
mitigation schemes, one of which is transmitting longer waitTime.
The overall result is a confirmation of our hypothesis that these
messages and parameter values can be used to infer overload. The
comparison is noteworthy as it supports our earlier results where
we compute RRCConnectionReject messages. Average waitTime
serves as an additional indicator of overloaded eNodeBs.
5.4 Omega (Ω) Measure
In addition to the reject messages and their corresponding waitTime,
cellBarred status is a crucial parameter that can indicate overload
in an eNodeB. The cellBarred status transmitted within a system
information block 1 (SIB1) message indicates that the UE is not
allowed to camp on a particular cell. We suspect that during over-
load conditions, cells can initiate load balancing by systematically
preventing UEs from anchoring on them. In order to evaluate our
theory, we analyze cellBarred messages to compare the percent-
age of these messages in our datasets.

The Omega (Ω) metric allows us to measure the ratio of cellBar−
red signals transmitted to the number of SIB1 frames received, in
thirty-second bins. We use this second-order metric to establish
a correlation between Omega and overload. Figure 6 depicts the
variation in Omega across all datasets. We observe an increase of
20% in SPD and CSR datasets over their respective baselines. This
indicates a relationship between cell barring signals and overload,
confirming our hypothesis. However, it is interesting to observe
that each of the mobile network operators (i.e., T-Mobile, Verizon
and AT&T) have comparable Omega values in SPD and CSR, even
though they exhibit noticeably different trends in Figures 3 and 4.
That is because the inherent load-handling capacity of eNodeBs, as
well as the density of users served, apparently differs. This suggests
that overloaded eNodeBs operating in disparate network conditions
prefer to consistently reject incoming connection requests rather
than broadcast unavailability (through cell barring messages), re-
gardless of their proprietary overload mitigation schemes.
6 CONCLUSION
In this work, we propose a novel method to assess overload in
nearby LTE eNodeBs, utilizing off-the-shelf hardware and without
requiring cooperation of the cellular provider. Our analysis offers
convincing evidence that messages broadcast by the eNodeB can
be used to detect cellular overload using passive monitoring. In
future work we will explore how passive overload inference can
be leveraged in a system for automated overload mapping using
ground-based data collection and Unmanned Aircraft Systems, in-
dependent of collaboration from a cellular provider. Such tools can

be leveraged by regulators and policy makers and allow targeted
deployment of alternative communication channels.
