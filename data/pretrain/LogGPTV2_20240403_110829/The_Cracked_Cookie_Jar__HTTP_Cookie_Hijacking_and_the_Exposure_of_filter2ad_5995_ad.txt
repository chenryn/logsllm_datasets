Depending on the time lapsed between the user browsing
the e-commerce site and the attacker browsing with hijacked
cookies, there is a decrease in the frequency of ads that contain
the viewed product. However, we found that even after several
hours we received ads that continued to promote the exact
product, and women’s clothing ads even after several days.
IV. COLLATERAL COOKIE EXPOSURE
In this section we explore other means by which a user’s
HTTP cookies may be exposed.
A. Browser Components
According to a manifest ﬁle analysis of over 30K Chrome
extensions [47], a higher number of extensions requested
permission for connecting to Google over HTTP compared to
HTTPS. The same was true for wildcarded (http://*/*)
permission requests. This indicates that a considerable number
of extensions may be weakening security by connecting over
unencrypted connections to websites that also support en-
crypted connections. To that end, we explore whether browser
components expose users to cookie hijacking attacks.
We analyze a selection of the most popular browser com-
ponents, for Chrome and Firefox, that have been released by
major vendors we have audited. Our aim is not to conduct an
exhaustive evaluation, but to obtain an understanding of the
implementation practices for browser components and assert
whether they also suffer from a limited use of encryption.
While we experiment with a relatively small number of
components, we consider any discovered exposure indicative
of general practices, as ofﬁcial extensions from major vendors
are likely to adhere to certain quality standards. As Google
has discontinued the development of extensions for Firefox,
we cannot do a direct cross-browser comparison for most of
its components.
Table IV lists the web components we have evaluated, their
reported number of downloads if available, and if they leak the
cookies required for our hijacking attacks. Our experiments
yield a number of surprising ﬁndings. The 3 Chrome apps
released by Google we tested expose the HTTP cookies,
while their extensions present mixed results with 4 out of 9
leaking the cookie. As one of those is Google Dictionary,
with over 2.7 million downloads, a signiﬁcant number of
Chrome users is vulnerable to considerable risk. Every Firefox
extension we tested, along with two of the default search bars,
actually expose the required HTTP cookies over unencrypted
connections. Interestingly, Google’s Search by Image exten-
sion is secure for Chrome but not for Firefox. As there is
no ofﬁcial Bing app for Firefox, we test the most popular
one, and we also audit a popular unofﬁcial Google translator
extension with over 794K users, both of which turn out to be
vulnerable. Overall, these ﬁndings highlight the privacy threats
that millions of users face due to browser components.
B. Mobile Devices
Mobile devices have become ubiquitous, and account for a
large part of the time users spend online. Due to the quota
restrictions in mobile data plans, users frequently connect
to public WiFi access points. According to Cisco [48], an
estimated 45% of mobile trafﬁc is “ofﬂoaded” to WiFi con-
nections. While this is not restricted to public WiFi networks,
it is indicative of user behavior, with a recent survey reporting
that 72% of the participants connect to public WiFi [49]. To
explore the feasibility of our HTTP cookie hijacking attacks
against users on mobile devices, we audited the ofﬁcial iOS
and Android apps for the most popular services that we found
to expose private information and account functionality.
The overview of our results is shown in Table V. It is
noteworthy that Bing differentiates mobile cookies and, as a

result, hijacked mobile cookies expose the search and click
history that has been conducted only over the mobile device;
the remaining personal information presented in Section III-B
is still obtainable. Spotlight, the system-wide search feature
of iOS, is also powered by Bing. When the user issues a
search query, Spotlight connects over HTTPS to Apple servers.
However, the search results contain a “Show more in Bing”
button and, if clicked, will open the browser showing the
search results and leak the user’s HTTP Bing cookie. For Siri,
the voice-guided assistant, the Bing results are opened in the
browser over HTTPS, preventing cookie hijacking. Once again
Yahoo follows poor security practices as 3 out of 4 iOS apps
leak the user’s cookies. As expected both versions of Gmail
protect the cookies, while iOS Amazon apps prior to version
5.3.2 expose the cookie. Furthermore, both Amazon iOS apps
contain cookies that reveal information about the user’s device
and mobile carrier (details in Appendix A). For both platforms,
the Ebay app will expose the cookies under certain conditions.
First, Ebay sellers are allowed to customize their item pages
and often add links to other items they are selling; if the
seller has added an HTTP Ebay link to those items, the cookie
will be exposed if a link is clicked by the user. Empirically
we found that that these HTTP links are common. The other
scenario is if the user clicks on the “Customer Support” menu.
C. Active Attacks
Remote hijacking. We analyze the cookies of each service
in depth, and identify what information the attacker can obtain
remotely, e.g., by stealing the user’s cookies through an XSS
734734
attack. While the HttpOnly attribute can prevent attackers
from remotely obtaining cookies through browser scripts, our
ﬁndings reveal limited adoption, indicating that the situation
has not improved in recent years [19].
to false for all
As can be seen in Table VI, websites with multiple cookies
never set the attribute for all. Most websites set the attribute
for some cookies, but allow other cookies to be accessed by
scripts. Furthermore, Amazon and Target have the HttpOnly
attribute set
their cookies. Surprisingly,
66.6% of the websites that are vulnerable to our cookie hi-
jacking attacks, also expose users to remote cookie hijacking.
For Yahoo, while we cannot access all the information and
account functionality described previously, several instances
remain possible (e.g., search history, username etc.) Even
though the attack cannot be done for Hufﬁngton Post as the
huffpost_s cookie has the ﬂag set, the remaining cookies
still expose the user’s username and email address.
