At the moment the scripts directory is hard coded to `scriptsDirectory = new
File(env.configFile(), "scripts");` but it would be handy to make this
configurable.  
Main reason is that with the Puppet module we allow multiple instances, and it
would be handy that all instances on a single node can share the same
directory where the scripts are located.
