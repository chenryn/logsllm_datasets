### 3.1 Pitfalls in Measuring Churn in Live P2P Botnets

**P1: Unbiased Sampling**
- **Description:** Samples must be collected in a non-biased manner. Biased peer selection can skew the measurements.
- **Impact:** If sampling is biased, the resulting data will not accurately reflect the true state of the botnet.

**P2: Long Sessions**
- **Description:** Given an interval \(\tau\) and a minimum accuracy \(\epsilon\), short sessions (uninterrupted time-windows of availability) can be measured. However, only one session of length \(\tau\) can be observed within the measurement period \(\tau\).
- **Impact:** This limitation may result in incomplete or fragmented data, leading to inaccurate churn measurements.

**P3: False Negatives**
- **Description:** False negatives in measurements can occur due to network congestion or temporary network failures, making bots appear offline when they are actually active.
- **Impact:** This can lead to underestimation of the botnet's size and activity.

**P4: Brief Events**
- **Description:** If the time between measurements is not granular enough, short-lived events may not be recorded, leading to missed sessions or misinterpretation of multiple short sessions as a single long session.
- **Impact:** Inaccurate representation of botnet activity and churn.

**P5: NAT Devices**
- **Description:** Nodes behind Network Address Translation (NAT) devices or firewalls cannot be directly contacted over the Internet unless they initiate the connection. This can lead to skewed results due to frequently changing ports or shared IP addresses.
- **Impact:** Measurement inaccuracies and potential undercounting of active nodes.

**P6: Dynamic IP Addresses**
- **Description:** Many Internet Service Providers (ISPs) use Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) or Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) to assign dynamic IP addresses. Reassignment of IPs will appear as separate leave-and-join events even though the bots remain online.
- **Impact:** Misinterpretation of botnet dynamics and churn rates.

**P7: Synchronization**
- **Description:** When using multiple monitoring instances, it is essential to ensure that the clocks are synchronized. Otherwise, aggregated results may lead to conflicting observations about the availability of bots.
- **Impact:** Inconsistent and unreliable data.

**P8: Non-persistent Identifiers**
- **Description:** The lack of unique and persistent identifiers introduces measurement inaccuracies, as new bots and re-joining bots cannot be easily differentiated.
- **Impact:** Difficulty in tracking individual bots and accurate churn measurement.

**P9: Anti-monitoring Mechanisms**
- **Description:** P2P botnets may deploy anti-monitoring mechanisms to hinder monitoring attempts. These mechanisms must be considered and circumvented to obtain accurate churn measurements.
- **Impact:** Potential for incomplete or misleading data if anti-monitoring mechanisms are not addressed.

### 3.2 Botnet Monitoring Framework (BMF)

In this subsection, we introduce the Botnet Monitoring Framework (BMF). As depicted in Figure 1, BMF aims to improve the efficiency and accuracy of future botnet monitoring activities, particularly in the context of obtaining churn measurements. BMF addresses most of the pitfalls discussed in Section 3.1.

**Components of BMF:**

1. **NoSQL Database:**
   - **Description:** BMF uses a NoSQL database, such as MongoDB, to store the vast and varied data obtained through monitoring activities. Relational databases do not scale well with the amount and type of information gathered from different botnets.
   - **Benefit:** Scalability and flexibility in storing diverse types of data.

2. **Modular Monitoring Modules:**
   - **Description:** BMF incorporates modular monitoring mechanisms, including honeypots, crawlers, and sensors. Each method has its own advantages and disadvantages, but combining their data during analysis (e.g., churn measurement) provides a more comprehensive view.
   - **Benefit:** Flexibility to integrate existing and new monitoring mechanisms, ensuring a robust and adaptable system.

3. **Coordinator:**
   - **Description:** The Coordinator manages the overall monitoring process, synchronizing data from different monitoring nodes and coordinating the activities of the monitoring modules.
   - **Benefit:** Ensures consistent and synchronized data collection, reducing the impact of false positives and other measurement errors.

**Key Features of BMF:**

- **Synchronization (P7):** The Coordinator ensures that all monitoring instances have synchronized clocks, preventing conflicting observations.
- **Dynamic IP Handling (P6):** By coordinating crawlers and sensors, BMF can better handle dynamic IP assignments and reduce the misinterpretation of leave-and-join events.
- **Anti-monitoring Countermeasures (P9):** BMF can coordinate monitoring nodes from different networks to probe a single bot, reducing the risk of triggering anti-monitoring mechanisms and minimizing false positives.
- **Long-term and Granular Monitoring (P2, P3, P5):** BMF is designed for long-term and granular monitoring, allowing for the adjustment of monitoring frequency as needed. This enables the collection of detailed and continuous data, which is crucial for accurate churn analysis.

### 4. Summary and Future Work

In this paper, we discussed the importance of accurate churn measurements for evaluating P2P botnet takedowns and enabling realistic simulations. We outlined ten common pitfalls in measuring churn in live P2P botnets and proposed BMF, a framework that addresses these pitfalls and allows for uniform and accurate churn measurements across various P2P botnets.

**Future Work:**

- **Addressing Pitfalls P7 and P9:** We plan to address the issues of dynamic IP addresses and non-persistent identifiers, which were observed in early measurements of the Hide'n Seek (HnS) botnet. After 148.16 hours of measurement, a group of bots disconnected simultaneously from a particular ISP, likely due to IP re-assignment. Due to the lack of unique identifiers, we were unable to re-identify the bots under their new IPs. Our goal is to address these issues by fingerprinting bots based on shared information and response behavior, such as Time to Live (TTL) and round-trip times.
- **Implementation and Long-term Measurements:** We intend to implement BMF and conduct long-term measurements for P2P botnets such as Sality, ZeroAccess, HnS, and Hajime. Based on these measurements, we aim to achieve three major goals:
  1. Enable more realistic simulations of P2P botnets.
  2. Compare churn across different botnets and analyze the differences between traditional and Internet of Things (IoT)-based botnets.
  3. Make BMF and the collected dataset freely available to foster collaboration and advances in the fight against botnets.
