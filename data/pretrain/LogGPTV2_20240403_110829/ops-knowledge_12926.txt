User: 请选择LogParser领域相关问题的正确答案及解释There are a few lines of logs as follows
 0 19:30:07,403 INFO New election. My id =  1, proposed zxid=0x700000000
 1 18:23:56,268 INFO Revalidating client: 0x24f0557806a001c
 2 18:25:24,332 INFO Revalidating client: 0x14f05578bd80013
 3 18:23:52,646 INFO Revalidating client: 0x14f05578bd80018
The first three parts of the log are index, timestamp, and log level. Without considering these three parts, Here we assume that the variables in the logs are represented as '<*>', separated by spaces between tokens. What is the specific log template for the above logs?

B: New election. My id =  <*>, proposed zxid=<*> 和 Revalidating client: <*>
