Unlike the VS Code installer for Windows, the VS Code uninstaller for Windows
is not signed. You can fix this by using the `SignTool` directive in your Inno
Setup script. See
http://www.jrsoftware.org/ishelp/index.php?topic=setup_signtool
For dual signing it's easiest to use Inno Setup 5.5.8 instead of 5.5.6 as you
currently use: 5.5.8 allows you to have two SignTool directives, one for the
sha-1 signing and another for the sha-256 signing.
