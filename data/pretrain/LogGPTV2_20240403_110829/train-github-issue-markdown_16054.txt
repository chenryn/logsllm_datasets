Unlike the VS Code installer for Windows, the VS Code uninstaller for Windows is not digitally signed. To address this, you can use the `SignTool` directive in your Inno Setup script. For more information, refer to the official documentation: [Inno Setup Help - SignTool](http://www.jrsoftware.org/ishelp/index.php?topic=setup_signtool).

For dual signing (both SHA-1 and SHA-256), it is recommended to use Inno Setup 5.5.8 instead of the currently used version 5.5.6. Version 5.5.8 supports multiple `SignTool` directives, allowing you to specify separate commands for SHA-1 and SHA-256 signing.
