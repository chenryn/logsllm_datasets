## Feature Request
In contexts where Babel is running alongside a filesystem watcher, there are
cases where a plugin may load an arbitrary file. Take a plugin like
https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-inline-import for example. Or some
usecases of babel-plugin-macros.
It would be ideal if Babel had a way for plugins to indicate that these
dependencies exist, so that if callers of Babel wanted to take that into
account, they could. For example, Webpack has `.addDependency`, so that
changes to that file will cause the loader to re-execute when the dependency
is changed. We could easily use this API in `babel-loader` to handle this.
Implementing a similar API in `@babel/cli`'s watcher wouldn't be too bad
either.
I don't know how other Babel wrappers would fair, but if someone wanted to
help investigate that, it would certainly help. Off the top off my head we'd
want to check, at the very least, if the following have ways to register
additional files to watch:
  * Meteor
  * Jest
  * Browserify
  * Gulp
### Edit
We may also want to include in this work logic to help us take dependency file
content into account for the purposes of cache invalidation. For example,
`babel-loader`'s `cacheDirectory` option will not invalidate caches, if say a
`.browserlistrc` file changes `preset-env`'s plugin list: babel/babel-
