#### Introduction
There are no national secrets here. We welcome spies and security specialists alike. Spies and security specialists are human too. :)

#### Why We Are Here Again
Last year, Val Smith, Colin Ames, and I (Anthony) collaborated on analyzing China-made malware, pioneering an east-meets-west research and study. This year, we have dealt with numerous targeted attack cases. We aim to share these case studies and correlation analyses with you, conducted in collaboration with my Taiwanese research fellows. Our presentation was accepted in the first round of DEFCON 19, but unfortunately, it was rejected by Blackhat. The reviewer commented, "We are curious about your automated analysis." Thank you for the feedback!

#### Agenda
- APT vs. Malware Case Studies
- Research Methodology
- Clustering Analysis and Results

#### Abstract
- **APT (Advanced Persistent Threat):** Targeted attacks against specific companies/organizations by organized groups.
- **Research Focus:** Case studies and analysis of APTs through malicious email documents. Our automated analysis identifies and clusters correlations among samples featuring various exploits, malware, and botnets.

#### Major APT Activity: Targeted-Attack Email
- **Types of Targeted-Attack Emails:**
  1. **Phishing Mail:** Steals user IDs and passwords.
  2. **Malicious Script:** Detects the end-user computing environment.
  3. **Install and Deploy Malware (Botnet):** Uses document exploits and malware.

#### APT Attack vs. Traditional Botnet Activities
| **APT Botnet Activities** | **Traditional Botnet Activities** |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Organized planning        | Mass distribution over regions    |
| No immediate damage       | No immediate damage              |
| Targeted (few groups/orgs) | Not targeted (large area spread)  |
| Specific organizations    | Individual credentials           |
| Long duration             | Short duration                   |
| Frequent attacks          | Infrequent attacks               |
| 0-day Exploit, embedded malware, multiple exploits, URL download malware | High detection rate (95%) if sample is new |
| Low detection rate (under 10% if sample is new) | IPS, IDS, and Firewalls ineffective |

#### Case Study: Political Party in Hong Kong

**Case 1: Calling from Mr. X**
- **Mr. X:** Key person in a political party in Hong Kong.
- **Suspicious Email:** Attachment named `meeting.zip` containing `agenda.doc` and `minutes.doc`.
- **Target Audience:** All committee members.
- **Timing:** Received before significant dates (June 4, July 1, and election).

**Analysis:**
- **Xecure Analyzer Engine:**
  - `agenda.doc` is a PE file, and `minutes.doc` is a shortcut (.lnk) that triggers `agenda.doc`.
  - Connects to a remote IP address in Hong Kong on port 8080.
  - Captures and records file and registry changes.
  - Injects code into `explorer.exe` and targets popular IM and email clients.
  - Uses XOR encoding for network traffic.

**Infection Path:**
- **Dropper (`agenda.doc`):**
  - Creates `IECheck.exe`.
  - Copies `WS2Help.PNF` to the application data folder.
  - Modifies `netstat.exe`.
  - Injects code into `msvcr.dll` and then to `explorer.exe`.
  - Detects anti-virus programs.
  - Targets QQ, MSN, sina, foxmail, and hotmail.

**Collected Information:**
- Host name, OS type, patch level, and more.
- Screenshots and other sensitive information sent back to the CnC server.

**Dynamic Analysis:**
- Downloads and executes `fvcwin32.exe`, `acvcwin32.exe`, and `avcwin32.exe`.
- Collects hard disk file information, email accounts, passwords, and system info.
- Captures screenshots every 1000 ms and sends them to the CnC server.

**Case Summary:**
- **Target:** Political party in Hong Kong.
- **CnC Server:** Located in Hong Kong.
- **Origin:** China.
- **Classification:** NAPT (Non-Advanced Persistent Threat) due to old routines for Win95/98, with new features added.
