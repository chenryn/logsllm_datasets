## Expected Behavior
All styled-components with their CSS attributes applied
## Current Behavior
All styled-components have their CSS class name, but, for any reason, some
styled-components don't have their CSS attributes, then their styles will not
be applied

  2. In this first page, the styled-components is ok, but in the second page exist the problem
  3. In the search input type: "Las Condes"
  4. Internally I redirect with:
      Router.push({
          pathname: '/results',
          { page: 1, lat: -33.3989812, lng: -70.5573124, operation: 'arriendo' },
