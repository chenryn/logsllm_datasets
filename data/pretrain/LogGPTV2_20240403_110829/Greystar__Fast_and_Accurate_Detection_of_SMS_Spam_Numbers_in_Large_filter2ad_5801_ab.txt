effective strategy is to identify a spam number after re-
ceiving reports from K distinct users. Meanwhile, de-
fense mechanisms based on victim spam reports are also
of low cost, because only numbersreportedby users need
to be further analyzed. Due to this reason, spam reports
are usually a trigger for more sophisticated investigation
on the senders, such as their sending patterns, service
plans, etc..
Despite the high accuracy and low cost, detecting SMS
spam based on spam reports is analogus to performing
spam ﬁltering at user devices. The major drawback is
detection delay, which we illustrate in Fig. 2 based on
the CDR data from January 2012. The red solid curve
in Fig. 2 measures how long it takes for a spam num-
ber to be reported after spam starts (a.k.a. report delay).
We consider a spam number starts spamming when it
ﬁrst reaches at least 50 victims in an hour (see Section 4
for discussion on spamming rates). From Fig. 2, we ob-
serve that less than 3% of the spam numbers are reported
within 1 hour after spamming starts. More than 50% of
the spam numbers are reported 1 day after. The report
delay is mainly due to the extremely low report rate from
users. In fact, less than 1 in 10,000 spam messages were
4Maintaining a whitelist of such legitimate intensive SMS users can
be challenging. First, we have little information to identify the white
list if the users are outside the network. Second, even for the users
inside the network, the whitelist can still be dynamic, with new busi-
nesses/organizations initiating/stopping SMS broadcasting services ev-
ery day. More importantly, users are not obliged to report to the carrier
when they intend to start such services.

reported during the ﬁve month observation period. Aside
from causing a long detection delay, the low report rate
also leads to many missed detections (see Section 7).
In addition, even when a victim reports a spam mes-
sage, how long it takes him/her is at the reporter’s dis-
cretion. The blue dotted curve in Fig. 2 shows how fast
a user reports a spam message after receiving it (user
delay). Note that each user can receive multiple spam
messages (possibly with different text content) from the
same sender and hence can report the same sender multi-
ple times. Thus, we deﬁne user delay as the time differ-
ence between when a user reports a spam message and
the last time that the user receives spam from that par-
ticular spam number before the report. We observe in
Fig. 2 , among users who report spam, half of the spam
messages are reported more than 1 hour after they receive
the spam messages. Around 20% spam are reported even
after a day. Due to such a long delay, spammers have
already inﬂicted signiﬁcant loss to the network and its
customers.
In addition to the problem of detection delay, the cur-
rent two-stage reporting method is error-prone. We ﬁnd
around 10% reporters fail to provide a valid spam num-
ber at the second stage. Moreover, spam report based
methods are vulnerable to attacks, as attackers can eas-
ily game with the detection system by sending bogus
reports to Denial-of-Service (DoS) legitimate numbers.
All these drawbacks render spam detection using victim
spam reports an insufﬁcient solution.
3.3 Overview of Greystar
Recognizing the drawbacks of existing victim report
based solutions, we introduce the rationale behind
Greystar. The objective of Greystar is to accurately de-
tect SMS spam while at the same time being able to con-
trol spam numbers as soon as possible before they reach
too many victims. To this end, we advance a novel notion
of grey phone numbers. These grey numbers usually do

not communicate with other mobile numbers using SMS,
they thereby form a grey territory that legitimate mobile
users rarely enter. On the other hand, as we shall see
in Section 4, it is difﬁcult for spammers to avoid touch-
ing these grey numbers due to the random target selec-
tion strategies that they usually adopt. Greystar then pas-
sively monitors the footprints of SMS senders on these
grey numbers to detect impending spam activities target-
ing a large number of mobile users.
Greystar addresses the problems in existing spam re-
port based solutions as follows. First, the population
of grey numbers is much larger and widely distributed
(see Section 5), providing us with more “spam alerts”
to capture more spam numbers more quickly. Second,
by passively monitoring SMS communication with grey
numbers, we avoid the user delay and errors introduced
when submitting spam reports. Last, Greystar detects
spammers based on their interactions with grey phone
space. This prevents malicious users from gaming the
Greystar detection system and launching DoS attacks
against other legitimate users.
In the following, we ﬁrst discuss related work in Sec-
tion 8. We then study the difference of spamming and
legitimate SMS activities in Section 4, which lays the
foundation of the Greystar system. In Section 5 we in-
troduce our methodology for identifying grey numbers.
We then present the design of Greystar in Section 6 and
evaluate it in Section 7.
4 Analyzing SMS Activities of Spammers
and Legitimate Users
We ﬁrst formally deﬁne SMS spamming activities. Dur-
ing a spamming process, a spammer selects (following
a certain strategy) a sequence of target phone numbers,
X := {x1,x2, · · · ,xi, · · · } (1 ≤ i ≤ n), to send SMS mes-
sages to over a time window T. Each target phone num-
ber is a concatenation of two components, the 3-digit

area code xa
i , which is location speciﬁc, and the 7-digit
subscriber number xs
i. Note that we only examine US
phone numbers (which have 10 digits excluding the lead-
ing country code “1”). Phone numbers of SMS senders
from other countries which follow the same North Amer-
ican Numbering Plan (NANP) are removed before the
study. All the statistics in this section are calculated
based on a whole month data from January 2012. To
compare the activities of spam numbers and legitimate
numbers, we obtain an equal amount of samples from
both groups. In particular, the spam numbers are identi-
ﬁed from victim spam reports and the legitimate numbers
are randomly sampled from the remaining SMS senders
appearing in the month-long CDR data set. Both samples
of phone numbers are checked by fraud agents before the
analysis to remove false positives and false negatives.
4.1 SMS Sending Rates
We ﬁrst compare the SMS sending rates of known spam
numbers and legitimate numbers.We measure the send-
ing rate at the granularity of hours, i.e., the average num-
ber of unique recipients a phone number communicates
with hourly.The CCDF curves of the sending rates are
shown in Fig. 3.
From Fig. 3, spam numbers have a much higher SMS
sending rate than legitimate numbers. This is not surpris-
ing given the purpose of spamming is to reach as many
victims as possible within a short time period. In par-
ticular, more than 95% of spam numbers have a sending
rate above 5 and more than 70% spam numbers exhibit
a sending rate above 50.
In contrast, more than 97%
of the legtimate numbers have a sending rate below 5.
As we can see in Section 6, by enforcing a threshold on
the sending rate, we can ﬁlter out most of the legitimate
numbers without missing many spam numbers.
Due to their high spamming rates, at the node-Bs that
spam numbers are connected to, we ﬁnd that the sheer
volume of spamming trafﬁc is astonishing. Spamming
trafﬁc can exceed normal SMS trafﬁc by more than 10
times. Even at RNCs, which serve multiple node-Bs,
trafﬁc from spamming can account for 80% to 90% of to-
tal SMS trafﬁc at times. Such a high trafﬁc volume from
spammers can exert excessive loads on the network, af-
fecting legitimate SMS trafﬁc. Furthermore, since SMS
messages are carried over the voice control channel, ex-
cessive SMS trafﬁc can deplete the network resource,
and thus can potentially cause dropped calls and other
network performance degradation. Meanwhile, the in-
creasing malware app instances that propagate through
the SMS channel also emphasize the importance of re-
stricting SMS spam activities in cellular networks.
We note that, although most legitimate numbers send
SMS at low rates (e.g., below 50), due to the large pop-
ulation size of the legitimate numbers, there are still
many of them with high sending rates indistinguishable
from those of spam numbers. Investigation shows that
they belong to organizations which use the SMS service
to disseminate information to their stakeholders, e.g.,
churches, schools, restaurants, etc. How to distinguish
these legitimate intensive SMS senders from SMS spam-
mers is the main focus of our Greystar system.
4.2 Spammer Target Selection Strategy
We next study how spammers select spamming targets.
We characterize their target selection strategies at two
levels, i.e., how spammers choose area codes and how
they select phone numbers within each area code.
We deﬁne the metric area code relative uncertainty
(rua) to measure whether a spammer favors phone num-
bers within certain area codes. The rua is deﬁned as:
−∑q∈QP(q)logP(q)
log|Q|
,
rua(X) :=
H(Xa)
Hmax(Xa)
=
where P(q) represents the proportion of target phone
numbers with the same area code q and |Q| is the total
number of area codes in the US. Intuitively, a large rua
(e.g., greater than 0.7) indicates that the spammer uni-
formly chooses targets across all the area codes. In con-
trast, a small rua means the targets of the spammer come
from only a few area codes.
We next deﬁne a metric random spamming ratio to
measure how spammers select targets within each area
code. Let Pa be the proportion of active phone num-
bers5 within area code a. For a particular spamming
target sequence Xa of a spam number, if the spammer
randomly chooses targets, the proportion of active phone
numbers in Xa should be close to Pa. Otherwise, we be-
lieve the spammer has some prior knowledge (e.g., with
an obtained target list) to select speciﬁc phone numbers
to spam. Based on this idea, we carry out a one sided Bi-
nomial hypothesis test for each spammer and each area
code to see if the corresponding target selection strat-
egy is random within that area code. The random spam-
ming ratio is then deﬁned as the proportion of area codes
within which a spammer selects targets randomly (i.e.,
the test fails to reject the randomness hypothesis with P-
value=0.05). Note that, for each spam number, only area
codes with more than 100 victims are tested to ensure the
validity of the test.
5The active phone numbers are identiﬁed as all registered phone
numbers inside the carrier’s billing database who have unexpired ser-
vice plans. We ﬁnd that the active numbers are uniform across all area
codes, possibly due to frequent phone number recycling within carrier
networks (e.g., phone numbers originally used by landlines are reas-
signed to mobile phones) and users switching between cellular carriers
while retaining the same phone numbers.

few numbers which have sent no more than 1 SMS mes-
sage during the one month period. For a majority of
these numbers, all the messages they have received are
spam (as indicated by the fact that most probability mass
is squeezed to a small region close to 1). This implies
that these SMS inactive numbers are good indicators of
spamming activities, i.e., SMS senders who communi-
cate with them are more likely to be spammers.
5 SMS Grey Phone Number Space
In order to utilize these SMS inactive numbers for spam
detection, we want to ﬁrst answer the following ques-
tions. Why do these numbers have a low volume of SMS
activity? Is there an inexpensive way to identify a sta-
ble set of such numbers for building the detection sys-
tem? To answer these questions, we carry out an in-
depth analysis of SMS inactive users. We then deﬁne
grey phone space and propose a method for identifying
the grey phone space using CDR records.
In the end,
we study properties of grey phone space and show the
potential of using it to detect spamming activities.
5.1 Investigating Service Plans
Cellular carriers often provide their customers with a rich
set of features to build their personal service plans. Users
are free to choose the best combination of features to
balance their needs and the cost. For example, a fre-
quent voice caller often opts in an unlimited voice plan
and a user who watches online videos a lot can choose
a data plan with a larger data cap. Therefore, service
plans encode demographic properties of the associated
users. We hence study the correlations between different
service plan features and SMS activeness to understand
these SMS inactive users.
More speciﬁcally, we extract all the service plans as-
sociated with the legitimate user samples, which include
features related to voice, data and SMS services. We cal-
culate the Pearson correlation coefﬁcients of the SMS ac-
tiveness and individual plan features (treated as binary
variables). The features are then ranked according to the
correlation values. We summarize the top 5 features that
are positively and negatively correlated with SMS active-
ness in Table 1.
