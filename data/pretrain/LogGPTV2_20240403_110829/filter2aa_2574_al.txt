complete tutorial on how to use this anonymous network. Tor, I2P, and Freenet are the 
most popular anonymous networks currently available. Tor surpasses the other two in 
being more widely used and more mature. We recommend using the Tor Network for all 
your online work that requires anonymity.
 Going Forward
As you saw during this chapter, searching for deep and dark resources is not 
straightforward. Current search engines are optimized to search the surface web 
and cannot search—and index contents—below it, even though some commercial 
companies that have developed some advanced search tools try to harvest data from the 
deep web (including dark web). The effectiveness of such tools is still limited in terms of 
retrieving accurate, linked, and complete results.

Now, with the advance of computing technology and the widespread use of Internet 
services around the globe, more criminals are shifting their activities online. Black hat 
hackers, terrorist organizations, and countries controlled by oppressive regimes are also 
using the Internet—especially the darknet—to conduct illegal activities. Governments 
and law enforcement entities around the globe must utilize all resources possible to 
capture and prevent bad actors from using Internet technology to facilitate their crimes.
To help overcome these challenges, the Defense Advanced Research Projects 
Agency (DARPA) in the United States has created the Memex program to help fight 
against human trafficking activity across the world. Memex is a next-generation search 
engine that focuses on helping law enforcement investigators find online perpetrators 
engaged in human trafficking in the cyberspace. Memex has the ability to search within 
the darknet and deep web in addition to the surface Internet to find linked information 
spread everywhere online to support investigators in their mission.
Although the key mission of the Memex is to fight against global human trafficking, 
it can be used by intelligence services and other military organizations to collect and 
correlate useful OSINT information from the deep/dark web about anything they want.
 Summary
The deep web and dark web have gained increased attention by researchers, law 
enforcement, and government entities. However, both terms are still unclear for most 
web users. In addition, the nature and technical architecture of darknet networks still 
lack clarity for many people.
In this chapter, we shed light on the concept of Internet layers and demonstrated by 
example the contents of each layer and how they can be accessed to retrieve information 
from them.
Two darknet networks were presented and compared. While Tor is a mature 
anonymity network with a wide user base and mostly used to browse the surface web 
anonymously because of its many exit nodes, I2P is beginning to get more attention as a 
preferred solution to host hidden websites inside the I2P darknet network because of its 
speed and stronger anonymity for both users and website operators.

125
As we already said, many darknet websites are dedicated to illegal activities; it is not 
the purpose of this chapter to introduce you to such illegal services and teach you how 
to access them. We highly encourage a typical Internet user not to visit the darknet at 
all. The main point here is to introduce you, especially OSINT investigators, to how to 
use online anonymity tools like the Tor Browser and the Tails OS to conduct your online 
investigations safely and anonymously. The information presented in this chapter will 
also benefit online investigators when accessing and searching within the dark areas of 
the Internet.
This chapter was dedicated to the deepest layers of the Internet. In the next chapter 
we will return to the surface to teach you how to use advanced techniques using typical 
search engines such as Google and Bing to search for OSINT resources online.

CHAPTER 4
Search Engine Techniques
The number of Internet users is increasing steadily, as is the number of active websites. 
According to Netcraft’s January 2017 Web Server Survey, there are 1,800,047,111 billion 
websites.i The number of pages on these websites changes continually according to 
many factors. Google Inside Search estimates that there are more than 130 trillion web 
pages discovered by Google; about 50 billion of them have been included in Google’s 
searchable index as of October 2017.ii Do not forget that Google—and similar search 
engines—cannot index the entire Web, as pages that belong to the deep/dark web 
cannot be discovered by typical search engines.
As you can see, the number of web pages that exist is huge, and finding your way in 
this mass media would be very difficult without search engines. A search engine works 
by sending a crawler—automated software—to continually scan active websites to add 
the discovered content to its index, which is stored in massive databases. The user then 
queries the search engine index, which returns the results—that may contain a mix of 
web pages, images, videos, and other file types—as a list of matching sites ranked by 
relevance.
Without a search engine, a user would need to access and check every website 
manually when seeking specific information. This would be a daunting task and consume 
a considerable amount of time for each search. Search engines also help users view only 
relevant results. For instance, search engine software scans each indexed page and selects 
a list of keywords from it to categorize it. When a user, for example, searches for cheap 
flight to Hawaii, all pages that offer flights to Hawaii will appear in the search result list. 
However, the top rank will be for the pages/websites strictly related to user search criteria. 
Please note that the algorithm for ranking websites in search results is secret for each 
search engine provider, and the rank for each website—even for the same query—can 
change hourly. However, the highest rank will be for the websites that satisfy the ranking 
algorithm criteria in terms of popularity and relevancy of the user’s search query.
128
Typical search engines like Bing and Google offer their services free of charge. They 
also offer advanced search features that can be used by users to conduct advanced 
searches. For example, Google offers a powerful Advanced Search (https://www.
google.com/advanced_search) that gives more specific search results (see Figure 4-1).
Figure 4-1. Google Advanced Search functionality returns more specific search results
The internal mechanism of search engines is not as simple as their interface. The 
more sophisticated the search engine, the more complicated the algorithm it uses to find 
and index contents from the Web. In this chapter, we will cover how to use different types 
of search engines efficiently to locate information online. We will start by focusing on 
Google because it’s considered the largest one and has plenty of specialized operators 
to conduct advanced searches (also known as Google dorks). We will also cover how to 
search for specific digital file types such as images and videos in addition to using many 
free online services to validate your findings. Before we begin, let’s cover how to select 
search keywords to return the most relevant results from search engines.

 Keywords Discovery and Research
As an OSINT investigator, you need to master the art of online searching, which requires 
you to use the correct search keywords. Typical search engines discover and index 
web pages using a variety of criteria. Apparently the most important one is the set of 
keywords available within the target page.
Keyword discovery help searchers to expand the breadth of their searches to include 
different variations of the same keyword and uncover synonyms and semantically 
related terms and phrases so they can better find content that may be rarely accessed by 
typical users conducting similar searches.
Keywords discovery is used extensively by online marketers in search engine 
optimization (SEO) to see which keywords are used by different people—using 
different search engines—to search for a similar topic. Online investigators can use the 
same technique to search for variations of a phrase/keyword in addition to acquiring 
intelligence about current search trends.
The following are the most popular keyword research tools:
• 
Google Keyword Suggest Tool (http://tools.seochat.com/tools/
suggest-tool): This gives keyword suggestions for Google, Bing, 
Amazon, and YouTube.
• 
Google AdWords (https://adwords.google.com/home/tools/
keyword-planner/) and Google Trends (https://www.google.com/
trends): These will show search volume and matrices of Google 
searches for any geographical region in the entire world.
• 
One Look (www.onelook.com/reverse-dictionary.shtml): Enter a 
word, phrase, sentence, or pattern to search for related words.

 Using Search Engines to Locate Information
In this section, we will show how to utilize search engines to get precise results, 
beginning with the giant, Google.
 Google
The Google search engine is the leader among its peers and has the greatest market 
share with more than 77 percent of global search traffic using it.
The number of daily searches conducted by web users globally on search engines is 
huge. Table 4-1 shows the number of daily searches per search engine.iii

Most web users have used a Google web search to find something online. A Google 
basic search is what you see when visiting the Google home page (www.google.com). 
You type your search query into the Google search box and hit the Google Search 
button. Alternatively, you can use your voice to enter the search query by clicking the 
microphone icon. The Google home page offers other useful services such as searching 
for images, videos, newsgroups, and maps in addition to the Google Translate service. 
Let’s see how you can use some Google words to refine a basic search for better results.
Warning! When using the following google search words (symbols), make sure 
not to put any space between the symbol and the search term (query).
Chapter 4  SearCh engine teChniqueS
131
 1. To search within social media sites, use the symbol @ followed by 
a social media name; then enter a colon your search query. For 
example, enter @facebook:nihad hassan to search for the term 
nihad hassan within Facebook).
 2. To search for hashtags, put a # sign before your search term. For 
example, enter #USAelection.
 3. To search for an exact match, surround your search term/phrase 
with quotation marks. For example, enter “data hiding”.
 4. The tilde (~) operator searches for the word that comes after 
it directly and for its synonyms. For example, entering Excel 
~guide will return Excel tutorials, tips, helper, video trainings, and 
anything synonymous with the word guide.
 5. The OR operator in capital letters only—also written as a 
vertical bar (|)— is used to find pages that contain the searched 
terms. For example, entering Apress OR springer (or entering 
Apress|Springer) will retrieve pages that contain either the term 
Apress or the term Springer.
 6. To exclude words from your search, put a minus (-) symbol in 
front of the word (phrase) that you want to leave out. For example, 
enter lacoste -animal.
 7. To search for the unknown words, use the asterisk (*) to substitute 
it with one or more words. For example, enter data hiding in *.
 8. Use the double dots (..) without spaces to provide a number range 
such as date, number, or price range. For example, enter USA 
earthquake 1980..2000.
 9. To search for similar web pages, put the word related: in the front 
of the web address that you want to see similar pages of. For 
example, enter related:springer.com.
 10. Use the word info: to return information that Google has about a 
certain domain. For example, enter info:springer.com.
 11. Use the word define to find a definition of the supplied keyword. 
For example, enter define:information.
Chapter 4  SearCh engine teChniqueS
132
 12. Use the word cache: to return the Google-cached version of the 
web page. For example, enter cache:apress.com.
 13. To search for information about a specific song or movie, enter 
Music: or Movie: followed by the song or movie name.
 14. To check the current weather in any place around the world, use 
the weather keyword. For example, enter weather:London.
 15. To show the stock price of any company, use the keyword stocks: 
followed by the company ticker symbol. For example, entering 
stocks:MSFT will show stock information for Microsoft Corporation. 
You can fetch any company stock ticker symbol by going to 
https://www.marketwatch.com/tools/quotes/lookup.asp.
 16. Use the keyword map: followed by location name and Google will 
show you map- based results. For example, enter map:New York.
 17. Enter time keyword to check the current date/time of your 
current location. To find the time of another location, precede the 
time keyword with the location name (for example, enter time 
New York).
Note! http://localtimes.info shows an interactive map of the time 
around the world right now. www.thetimenow.com shows the date, time, and a 
calendar in addition to weather forecasts and more information about the current 
location. (the current location is detected using your connection ip address, so 
make sure to update your location if you are using a Vpn service that masks your 
real ip address.)
 18. Google also can be used as a converter between currencies and 
measures. For example, enter (190 cm in feet) or (1000 dollars  
in yen).
 19. You can even check flight information using Google. Type your 
airline company name and the flight number in the Google search 
box and it will show you flight status information graphically  
(see Figure 4-2).
Chapter 4  SearCh engine teChniqueS
133
Google is also famous for its image search. For instance, to search for a specific 
image, you can use the Google Advanced Image Search at https://www.google.com/
advanced_image_search, which allows you to set different image search criteria (such as 
size, color, type, etc.) to locate your target image.
Basic search is suitable for beginners, and you do not need to worry about the 
spelling or capitalization of your searched keywords because Google will fix this for you. 
However, when it comes to fetching relevant information related to a specific topic, you 
need to use the Google special operators to return information that is difficult to locate 
through simple search queries.
 Google Advanced Operators
The advanced options are also known as Google hacking or Google dorks. Google 
hacking occurs when a user combines search keywords with advanced Google search 
operators to locate hidden information that is difficult to locate using a basic Google 
search. For example, Google hacking can be used to find vulnerable web servers 
or lists of personally identifying information (PII) files for employees/clients in a 
Figure 4-2. Showing information for the American airline company, flight 10
Chapter 4  SearCh engine teChniqueS
134
specific company that could have been left on a company server without protection. 
Cybercriminals, black hat hackers, and even terrorists use this technique to collect 
sensitive data online to facilitate launching further attacks against the target.
In the following list, we show examples of advanced Google search operators 
beginning with the simplest. The general format is as follows: operator:search_term. 
(There is no space between the operator, the colon, and the keyword search).
• 
The site operator asks Google to search within one website or 
domain. For example, if you enter hide site:darknessgate.com, 
Google will search for the word hide within the darknessgate.com 
website only. Using the same operator, you can restrict your search 
within one domain type. For example, enter computer forensics 
site:gov to search for the term computer forensics in all websites with 
the .gov domain.
• 
Insert your query search term after the allintext operator and Google 
will restrict its search to all pages that contain the terms specified. 
For example, enter allintext:free SMicrosoft service and Google 
will only return the pages that have the three terms free and SMS and 
service within its text.
• 
Begin your search with the allintitle operator and follow it with your 
search terms. Google will only return the pages that contain your 
searched query in their titles. For example, enter allintitle:Nihad 
hassan to have Google return all pages that have nihad hassan in 
their title (the page title appears at the top of the browser window), as 
shown in Figure 4-3.
Figure 4-3. Searching within page titles for a specific term
Chapter 4  SearCh engine teChniqueS
135
• 
If you use the allintitle operator in an image search, it will return 
images in files whose names contain the specified search query.
• 
Begin your search with the allinurl operator followed by your search 
term and Google will restrict its results to all the pages that contain 
your searched terms in their URL. For example, enter allinurl:OSINT 
intelligence and Google will return pages with the terms OSINT 
intelligence in their URLs (see Figure 4-4). You cannot include other 
search operators with the allinurl operator.
• 
When using the filetype suffix with your search terms, Google will 
restrict the results to web pages that end with this extension. For 
example, enter osint intelligence filetype:PDF and Google will 
return PDF files that match the specified search query.
• 
To search for more than one file type, add their extensions to 
the search query as follows: osint intelligence filetype:pdf OR 
filetype:doc. Google supports searching for different file types; the 
list of indexable file formats is available at (https://www.google.
com/support/enterprise/static/gsa/docs/admin/74/gsa_doc_
set/file_formats/file_formats.html).
All these examples are simple demonstrations of how you can use advanced Google 
search operators to return accurate relevant results. Online investigators should be 
creative and work to develop their search skills by utilizing different search operators in 
one statement to return the best results.
Figure 4-4. Using the Google allintitle operator
Chapter 4  SearCh engine teChniqueS
136
Note! google advanced Search (https://www.google.com/advanced_
search) allows users to use advanced search operators without typing them 
manually into the search box, although it still has limitations on conducting more 
creative searches. however, it’s still considered a great tool for casual users to 
search google professionally.
 Google Hacking Database
The Google Hacking Database (see Figure 4-5) created by Johnny Long contains 
hundreds of ready-to-use advanced Google search terms that can be used to acquire 
intelligence online. It can help you to find the following and more:
• 
Vulnerable web servers
• 
Files that contain sensitive information such as usernames/
passwords in addition to configuration files that contain settings and 
other important information from Internet devices
• 
Sensitive directories left without protection
• 
Error messages generated by servers, databases, and other software 
that can be exploited to invade information systems
• 
Information about network devices such as firewalls, IDS logs, and 
configurations
• 
Different IoT devices and the control panels of unprotected ones
• 
Hidden pages such as intranets, VPN services, and others
