User: I am learning Python from "Learn Python the Hard Way" and searched up quite a bit on it with no solutions as of yet. 
I configured the path for python to work on the command prompt. But whenever I type in 
"python ex1.py"  
it comes up with an error: Errno2 No such file or directory!
The code is a simple print code, nothing much there. But I do not know why it's showing this! I have all these exercises in the python directory
C:\python27\projects\ex1.py
Assistant: In general, windows defaults to the user directory in the command prompt. Saying "python ex1.py" is trying to find ex1.py in the C:\User\Username directory. Try moving your python script there or moving to the python projects folder using cd. Either way should fix the issue.
