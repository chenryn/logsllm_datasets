ABSTRACT
The pool of unused routable IPv4 preﬁxes is dwindling, with less
than 4% remaining for allocation at the end of June 2014. Yet the
adoption of IPv6 remains slow. We demonstrate a new capture-
recapture technique for improved estimation of the size of “IPv4
reserves” (allocated yet unused IPv4 addresses or routable pre-
ﬁxes) from multiple incomplete data sources. A key contribution
of our approach is the plausible estimation of both observed and
unobserved-yet-active (ghost) IPv4 address space. This signiﬁ-
cantly improves our community’s understanding of IPv4 address
space exhaustion and likely pressure for IPv6 adoption. Using
“ping scans”, network traces and server logs we estimate that 6.3
million /24 subnets and 1.2 billion IPv4 addresses are currently in
use (roughly 60% and 45% of the publicly routed space respec-
tively). We also show how utilisation has changed over the last
2–3 years and provide an up-to-date estimate of potentially-usable
remaining IPv4 space.

INTRODUCTION
At the end of June 2014 less than 4% of the IPv4 address space
remained unallocated by Regional Internet Registrars (RIRs). RIPE
and APNIC have exhausted their supply and the other RIRs (except
AfriNIC) will run out of preﬁxes by the end of 2014 [1]. Under-

IPv4 address markets, requires plausible estimates of actual IPv4
address use – particularly the eﬃciency with which allocated pre-
ﬁxes are ﬁlled with actively-used addresses. Ideally, our estimation
techniques should also help the community track progressive ex-
haustion once all routable IPv4 preﬁxes are allocated.
Prior studies that, among other things, analysed IPv4 space
growth [2–4] and a port scan census from 2012 [5] used mainly
active probing (“pinging”). Yet pinging alone will under-count, as
many hosts do not respond or their responses are ﬁltered (e.g., by
ﬁrewalls). Recently, Dainotti et al. [6] used IPv4 data from multi-
ple sources to estimate the used /24 networks. Apart from a simple
multiplier in [3], previous work did not attempt to correct for under-
sampling.
Our key contribution in this work is a new method to estimate the
true population of both observed and unobserved (yet still active)
IPv4 addresses using a statistical capture-recapture (CR) [7–9]
model applied over diverse sources of active and passive measure-
ment data. We signiﬁcantly extend our earlier workshop paper,
with reﬁned methodology, additional data sources and greatly ex-
tended analysis [10].
Our second contribution is a three-year study of address use us-
ing our CR method. We “pinged” the allocated space with ICMP
echo requests and TCP port 80 probes, and also gathered IPv4
data from web server logs [11], email spam detector logs [12],
Wikipedia edit logs, logs of Valve’s Steam online game platform,
logs from Measurement Lab [13], and university access router’s
NetFlow logs.
Inevitably, our sources only detect actively used
addresses from 80% of the allocated space that is publicly routed
(based on [14]). Hence, our analysis is focused on the routed space.
Although our sources provide diverse evidence of active IPv4
address use, there are likely many in-use addresses that we never
see. We utilise our CR method to estimate a total population of
used IPv4 addresses (and /24 networks) that includes these unob-
served addresses (ghosts). As many sources obtain measurements
over weeks or months, our estimates of the used IPv4 addresses
(and /24 networks) are based on observation periods rather than
points in time. By cross-validation with our datasets, and compar-
ison with a few samples of ground truth, we show our CR method
provides better estimates than prior techniques. We analyse “de-
mand” – growth in address use – over the last 2–3 years relative
to factors such as the RIR, country, or preﬁx size, and estimate the
remaining “supply” of unused preﬁxes.
With just ICMP pinging we observed 4.9 million used /24 sub-
nets and 430 million used IP addresses. Our combined sources ob-
served 5.9 million used /24 subnets and 740 million used IPv4 ad-
dresses, yet our CR technique indicates signiﬁcantly higher actual
usage. We estimate 6.3 million /24 subnets and 1.2 billion IPv4 ad-
dresses were used by the end of June 2014 (approx. 60% and 45%
319of the publicly routed space respectively). From the end of 2011 to
June 2014, the growth in used /24 subnets and IPv4 addresses was
roughly linear, with an increase of 0.45 million /24 subnets and 170
million IPv4 addresses per year.
These trends mean routed but currently unused space could sup-
ply us until 2023. However, supply varies signiﬁcantly across re-
gions, for example Asia and South America only have supply for
another 2–4 years (without reallocations between RIRs). Moreover,
if, for example, only 75% of all routed /24 subnets could ever be
used, regions with tight supply, like Asia and South America, have
less than 1 year of supply left. Unrouted unused space may provide
more supply.
The paper is organised as follows. Section 2 discusses related
work. Section 3 describes the concept of CR and our log-linear CR
models. Section 4 describes our IPv4 address data collection and
processing. Section 5 covers the validation of our CR model. In
Section 6 we analyse the growth of used IPv4 space over time, and
in Section 7 we estimate the space still unused. Section 8 concludes
and outlines future work.
2. RELATED WORK
The related measure of routed address space has been estimated
based on preﬁxes advertised by BGP [15,16]. However, estimation
of the number of actively used addresses began with Pryadkin et
al. [2], who used ICMP echo and TCP SYN probing to probe the
allocated Internet. They discovered 62 million used IPv4 addresses
in 2003 and 2004. Pryadkin et al. also showed that only a small
number of allocated preﬁxes appeared to be heavily used, while a
large part of the IPv4 space appeared unused or underutilized.
Heidemann et al. [3] infrequently probed all allocated IPv4 ad-
dresses (census) and frequently probed selected address samples
(survey) with ICMP echo pinging to study usage, availability and
up-time of addresses. The last census in 2007 from [3] accounted
for 112 million used addresses. Heidemann et al. compared ICMP
probing with TCP port 80 probing and passive measurements based
on small samples. They proposed a correction factor of 1.86, thus
estimating the total number of used IPv4 addresses in mid 2007
was 200–210 million.
Cai et al. [4] used ping survey data from [3] and conducted more
surveys in 2009–2010 to analyse typical address block sizes and
their characteristics. They did not directly estimate the used IPv4
address space, but observed: “most addresses in about one-ﬁfth of
/24 blocks are in use less than 10% of the time”.
From June to October 2012, anonymous researchers used hacked
commodity routers to perform a port scan of the IPv4 Internet [5].
They detected 420 million addresses that responded to ICMP echo,
which is broadly consistent with our two ping censuses that de-
tected 360 million addresses between March and September 2012.
In 2013 we initially proposed using a log-linear CR model to
estimate the true population of used IPv4 addresses from multiple
sources of IPv4 addresses [10]. Our preliminary workshop paper
found that our log-linear CR estimate is signiﬁcantly higher (one
billion used IPv4 addresses in mid 2013) than the aggregate number
of observed IPv4 addresses from multiple measurement sources.
Dainotti et al. [6] developed techniques to ﬁlter out spoofed IPv4
addresses from darknet or NetFlow data and showed that the ﬁl-
tered datasets can be used to estimate Internet address space usage.
With the ﬁltered darknet data, NetFlow data, and ping census data
from USC [3] combined, they estimated 4.8 million used /24 sub-
nets (47% of the routed space) in September 2012. This is broadly
consistent with the 5.2 million /24 subnets we observed in the year
to September 2012 (c.f. Figure 4). The diﬀerence is likely due to
the larger number of sources and the longer time window we use.
3. CAPTURE-RECAPTURE
There are many techniques for estimating population sizes from
limited samples. Some use problem-speciﬁc approaches, but many
use CR methods. CR methods have been used in ecology [7, 8],
epidemiology [9, 17], and to estimate missing links from observed
AS-graphs [18].
First, we discuss general assumptions for CR. Then, to illus-
trate CR, we discuss the simplest CR technique – the two-sample
Lincoln-Petersen (L-P) method. Since we have more than two
sources and for our data some assumptions of the L-P method are
violated, we do not use this method. Finally, we describe the log-
linear CR models that we use. Log-linear models make less restric-
tive assumptions and work with arbitrarily many sources.
3.1 General assumptions
A prime assumption of CR is that all individuals of the popu-
lation can be uniquely identiﬁed. This assumption obviously holds
for IPv4 addresses (we only care if an address was used but not who
used it). Another assumption is that the data sources only sample
“alive” individuals. We achieve that by ﬁltering out IPs from the
data sources that were sampled but not actually used, for example
due to address spooﬁng (see Section 4).
Any individuals with zero sample probability are not part of the
CR estimate. In our case these are all used IP addresses in publicly
unrouted space, which our sources cannot sample. Hence, our CR
estimates are only for the publicly routed space. Furthermore, there
may be some specialised devices using public IP addresses, such as
printers, that our current data sources also cannot sample. This
means our results likely have a downward “bias”, but as discussed
in Section 4.2 the error may be relatively small.
3.2 Two-sample Lincoln-Petersen method
The Lincoln-Petersen (L-P) method [7, 8] is ideal to illustrate
the basic principle behind CR, but has restrictive assumptions that
prevent us from using it.
3.2.1 Description
The two-sample L-P method works as follows. Given a ﬁrst sam-
ple, that observes M individuals, the size of the population would
be known if we knew what fraction of the population had been ob-
served. To estimate this, L-P takes a second sample. Say it contains
C individuals, of which R individuals occur in both samples. If the
fraction of “recaptured” individuals in the second sample equals
the fraction of the total population captured in the ﬁrst sample,
R/C = M/N, then the population N is [7, 8]:
N =
MC
R .
In our context, the samples or “sources” are diﬀerent active and
passive measurements (see Section 4). For concreteness, consider
Source 1 to result from pinging the entire IPv4 space and Source 2
to be all addresses in a server log. Based on the number of unique
addresses observed by Source 1 and Source 2, and the number of
unique addresses observed by both sources (Overlap) CR allows
to estimate the number of unobserved addresses (Unseen), as illus-
trated in Figure 1.
3.2.2 Assumptions
The L-P estimate assumes that the probability of an individual
being captured in one source does not depend on the probability of
being captured in a diﬀerent source (independent sources). It also
assumes that, within a sample, each individual has an equal chance
of being sampled (homogenous population). Furthermore, the L-P

estimate assumes that during measurement no individuals enter or
leave the population (closed population). However, a violation of
the last assumption is just another form of heterogeneity.
Given our data sources (see Section 4.1), there is no signiﬁcant
causal relationship to introduce source dependence. While some
samples are dependent, i.e. IPs observed in traﬃc ﬂows between
the two NetFlow-monitored sites or between one NetFlow site and
one of the logged sites (e.g. Wikipedia or the gaming site), their
number is very small compared to the overall size of the datasets
(less than 1%). However, the population is very heterogeneous; for
example, servers are more likely to respond to pinging, while client
