### SharePoint Knowledge Network

**Overview:**
The SharePoint Knowledge Network (KN) is a component of Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 (MOSS). It serves as an enterprise social networking tool designed to facilitate collaboration and the discovery and sharing of undocumented knowledge and relationships within an organization.

**Key Features:**
- **Connecting People:** KN connects individuals, enabling them to collaborate more effectively.
- **Expertise Discovery:**
  - **Who Knows Whom? (Connectors):** Identifies key connectors within the organization.
  - **Who Knows What? (Expertise Location):** Helps in locating subject matter experts.
- **Automated Expertise Discovery:** KN is designed to uncover hidden expertise on any topic, rather than just identifying well-known experts. This organic discovery of expertise enables organizations to make better decisions more quickly.

**Core Beliefs:**
Microsoft developed the Knowledge Network based on three core beliefs:
1. **Most Information is Undocumented:** A significant amount of valuable information is not formally documented.
2. **Difficult to Connect to the Right Person:** Finding the right person with specific knowledge can be challenging.
3. **Weak Ties Deliver Significant Value:** Even weak connections can provide substantial value in terms of knowledge and resources.

**Solution Components:**
- **Client:**
  - **Analyze Email:** Creates user profiles by analyzing email for keywords, contacts, and external contacts.
  - **Publish Profile:** Updates and publishes the profile to the server incrementally.
- **Server:**
  - **Aggregate Profiles:** Compiles expertise information and social network data.
  - **Search for People:** Facilitates searches for people who know specific individuals or have specific knowledge.

**Data Sources:**
- Email
- Team Sites
- Web
- IM Contacts
- Contact Lists
- Portraits
- My Sites
- AD Relationships
- Distribution Lists
- Correlation Store

**Correlation Store:**
The Correlation Store aggregates relationship data from various sources and makes it accessible through a web browser. It also provides APIs and an SDK for integration with line-of-business applications.

**Privacy and Control:**
- **Privacy Concerns:** Microsoft acknowledges potential privacy concerns and aims to balance utility, simplicity, and privacy.
  - **Utility:** The usefulness of the software to the user.
  - **Simplicity:** Ease of installation, upload, maintenance, and use.
  - **Privacy:** The amount of personal information revealed and the user's control over it.
- **Profile Management:**
  - **Notification:** Users can choose which items to include or exclude in their profiles.
  - **Privacy Levels:** Users can set one of five privacy levels for each profile item, controlling who can view the information.
  - **Admin Control:** Administrators can configure default operations, including opt-in/opt-out settings and default privacy visibilities.
  - **Consent:** No data is sent to the server without the user's approval.

**Future Developments:**
- **Breaking News:** Some blogs report that the KN may not be included in the next version of SharePoint, while others suggest it might be renamed and integrated into other products.
- **Technological Preview:** KN is seen as a technological preview, with potential inclusion in future versions of Windows and other server products.
- **Behind the Scenes:** There is curiosity about what similar technologies are being used by MSN/Live/Bing and Google, based on their handling of IM, email, blogs, and news.
