Sharepoint Knowledge 
Network
A component of Microsoft Ofﬁce Sharepoint 
Server 2007 (MOSS )
Total Information Awareness
Not just for the government anymore
KN is about connecting people 
KN is enterprise social networking
KN enables users to collaborate 
KN automates the discovery and sharing of 
undocumented knowledge and relationships.
KN helps discover Who knows whom? (Connectors)
KN helps discover Who knows what? (Expertise 
Location)
KN is an automated tool, to discover expertise within 
an organization. 
It is not meant to discover the experts, since they are 
already well known. 
It is mean to discover hidden gems of expertise on any 
topic. 
“Organically discover expertise to enable an organization to 
make better choices quicker”
Microsoft is created KN based on three core 
beliefs:
๏    * Most information is undocumented
๏    * It’s difﬁcult to connect to the right person
๏    * “Weak ties” deliver signiﬁcant value
The Knowledge Network solution is split into  a client 
and a server that work together to 
•    (Client) Analyze email to create proﬁle (keywords, 
contacts, external contacts)
•    (Client) Publish proﬁle to server (incremental updates)
•    (Seeker) Aggregate proﬁles (expertise information, 
social network)
•    (Seeker) Search for people (who know who? Who 
knows what?)

Correlation Store

Correlation Store, which is surfaced through the

business applications via APIs and an SDK.
Useful software
Microsoft understands that there may be privacy 
concerns involving KN. (WOW) 
Addresses these concerns involves striking the right 
balance among utility, simplicity and privacy.
 Utility is how useful will this software be to me?
Simplicity is how easy will this software be to install, 
upload, maintain and use?
Privacy is how much personal information will this 
software reveal and how much control do I have?
    * Communicate steps of the proﬁle creation and 
publication process
    * Customers can expose privacy policy in the client 
proﬁle wizard
Notiﬁcation
User can choose which items to include/exclude
 User can choose from 5 levels of privacy to apply to 
each proﬁle item to control who is allowed to view that 
information on the server (i.e. everyone (outermost ring 
of visibility), my colleagues, my workgroup, my 
manager, and me (center of the visibility universe))
   Admins can determine which aspects of the product 
functionality to leverage including external contacts, 
anonymous results, and DL keywords
Control
Control 2
Admins can conﬁgure the default operation of the 
client, including opt-in/opt-out and the default privacy 
visibilities for proﬁle items
 KN sends no data to the server before the user has 
approved it
