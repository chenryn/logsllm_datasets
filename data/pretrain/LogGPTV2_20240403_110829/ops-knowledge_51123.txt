User: How to evaluate server hardware performance and system bottlenecks, and what common tools and indicators are there?
Assistant: You can use the following common tools and indicators to evaluate server hardware performance and system bottlenecks: 1. CPU usage: By monitoring the CPU usage of the server, you can determine whether the CPU performance has reached the bottleneck. You can use top, htop and other tools for monitoring. 2. Memory usage: By monitoring the memory usage of the server, you can judge whether the memory is sufficient and whether there are problems such as memory leaks. You can use free, top and other tools for monitoring. 3. Disk IO: By monitoring the disk read and write speed of the server, it can be judged whether the disk IO has reached the bottleneck. You can use iostat, iotop and other tools for monitoring. 4. Network bandwidth: By monitoring the network bandwidth usage of the server, you can determine whether the network has reached a bottleneck. You can use iftop, nload and other tools for monitoring. 5. Load balance: By monitoring the load balance of the server, it can be judged whether the server has reached the maximum load balance. You can use tools such as uptime and loadavg to monitor. In addition to the above common tools and indicators, you can also use performance testing tools, such as Apache Benchmark, JMeter and other tools for stress testing to test the performance limit of the server. At the same time, according to the characteristics of the application, appropriate tools and indicators can be selected for evaluation.
