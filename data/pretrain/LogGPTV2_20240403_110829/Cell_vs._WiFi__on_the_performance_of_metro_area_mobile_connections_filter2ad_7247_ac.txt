normalized performance for each hour of the day, and the stan-
dard deviation of the normalized performance for each hour of the
day, as in [33]. These measures allow us to determine whether cer-
tain hours in the day give consistently better or worse performance
than others. Note that while we have a large number of total data
points across all servers, the data are still quite temporally sparse.
Thus, we do not examine time windows smaller than 1 hour. Nev-
ertheless, these plots provide insights on how performance for each
technology varies with time of day in each metro area.
3.3 Spatial Characteristics of Subregions
We believe that metro areas are a highly useful spatial aggregate
for our study since they provide a sufﬁcient corpus of daily data
for temporal analysis and are commonly used in socio-economic
analyses. Analyses at the metro area scale can enable the impact of
large scale events such as storms or power outages to be evaluated.
However, metro areas typically comprise hundreds of square miles,
potentially thousands of cellular and WiFi access points and mil-
lions of users. As indicated above, this density can preclude iden-
tiﬁcation of smaller scale unexpected or noteworthy events, which
is a goal of our work. To that end, we also analyze performance in
subregions for each metro area.
To analyze subregions, we generate a spatial interpolation of
performance using a technique called inverse distance weighting
(IDW) [32]. In IDW, the interpolated performance varies accord-
ing to the distance away from measurement points. The method
can produce a smooth contour of predicted performance based on
measurement data, and we color each contour band depending on
interpolated performance (e.g., blue for good performance, yellow
for intermediate performance, and red for poor performance).
With 15 weeks of data for each metro area, the question of the
temporal selection of data for subregions is also important. Se-
lections over longer time periods enable a ﬁrst order perspective
similar to what we conduct for entire metro areas, while selections
over shorter time scales enable assessment of localized changes in
performance, which is a goal of our work. Similar to our basic and
temporal analyses, we consider subregion performance over the full
15 weeks as well as shorter intervals of days or hours.
Our spatial analysis is facilitated by the ArcGIS tool [19] —a
widely used Geographic Information System that is easily adapted
to processing the Speedtest data. With ArcGIS, we are able to per-
form IDW and kriging [29] analyses, among other types of spa-
tial analyses. We are also able to overlay our plots on base maps
that include roads and administrative or political boundaries, such
as county, state and country borders, and postcode or zipcode di-
visions. ArcGIS exposes a Python-based API, which we heavily
leveraged for our work. While this API does not expose all Ar-
cGIS functionality, it enables repetitive tasks to be automated. In
total, the scripts that were developed for Speedtest data analysis
comprised several hundred lines of code, which we intend to make
publicly available.

While we endeavor to be comprehensive in our reporting, the size
of our data set and scope of our analyses precludes inclusion of all
analyses due to space constraints. Thus, in a number of cases, we
show ﬁgures and report ﬁndings that are exemplars of a broader set
of results.
