kdeplot() offers an argument fill. It would be nice to offer this argument to
lineplot() as well.
    sns.lineplot(
       data=data, x="x", y="y", hue="category", fill=True, palette="crest", alpha=.5, linewidth=0
    )

Keep in mind that the lineplot can be used in the context of a polar plot
(axis projection: "polar").
