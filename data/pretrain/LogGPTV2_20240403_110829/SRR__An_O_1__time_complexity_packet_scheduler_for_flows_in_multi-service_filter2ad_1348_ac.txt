Proof: According to SRR, a packet becomes the head of a flow if 
it is the head of a new flow or the packets before it have left the 
system.  When  a  packet  becomes  the  head  of  a  flow,  it  will  be 
served  when  SRR  visits  the  flow  again.  A  flow  is  visited  when 
one of its coefficients 
 is visited by SRR. So the 
delay  bound  of  a  flow  is  the  maximum  value  of  the  intervals 
between two adjacent visits by SRR. Let  count  be the sum  of 
times that each non-zero terms of M is visited by SRR during this 
interval. According to the value of 
fw , there are two cases.
