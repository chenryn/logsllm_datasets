User: I am trying to open a resource via an absolute path on my Macbook with open(file[,mode]). The resource I am trying to access is not in the same folder as the script that is running. If I use something like /Users/myname/Dev/project/resource I get an IOError: No such file or directory. Whats confusing me is that if i add and extra forward slash to the beginning so it starts with //Users/... it finds the resource without a problem.
What is going on here?
Assistant: The best way to deal with this is to avoid constructing the path yourself altogether. Let os.path.join() do it for you.
