indicator function for a source s for a time bin t that is 1 if the
source is observed, and 0 otherwise. For property (1) we compute,
for each s ∈ S:

Is(t);
for property (2) we determine, for each s ∈ S:
{t ∈ T|Is(t) = 1} − min

Communication attempts may span multiple time bins, which
could lead to inadvertently skewing properties (1), (2) and (3). In
Table 3, we report statistics on communication attempts (packets
with the same {source ip, destination ip, protocol, source port, des-
tination port} observed in one hour of data) by IBR component
from UCSD-13. The number of communication attempts varies
depending on the IBR component, as does the behavior of the hosts
sending each type of trafﬁc (as evidenced by the median number
of attempts per source IP address). However, for all components,
the average number of packets per communication attempt is small.
Manual investigation reveals that the timing between packets is also

UCSD-13. IBR components vary in the number of communica-
tion attempts made, and the median attempts made per source IP
addresses. But, all components have a low number of packets per
attempt, which suggests binning the data will not result in signiﬁ-
cant double counting.
Figure 5: CDF of contact duration (UCSD-13). At all source
granularities the contact duration is long, which is desirable for
analysis throughout the datasets.
number of contacts per source increases. For example, we observe
trafﬁc from over 75% of IP addresses, /24 blocks, preﬁxes ASes
and countries in multiple days.
6.2 What is the total duration of contact?
To conclude if our observations are the result of a single bursty
event, or if sources are visible throughout the 2012 or 2013 census
periods, we investigate the range of times that we observe a source.
We calculate each source’s duration of contact (time of last contact
minus time of ﬁrst contact). Figure 5 shows the CDF of this dis-
tribution. The total duration of contact is long (over 29 days out
of 34) for most /24 blocks, preﬁxes, ASes, and countries. Despite
observing most IP addresses in only a few 1-minute or 1-hour time
bins, the duration of contact is also long for IP addresses (50% IP
addresses had a duration of contact longer than 22.5 days), imply-
ing that there is a long time between consecutive observations of a
source (Section 6.3).
We attribute the long duration of contact at the IP level to Qihoo
360 Safe trafﬁc, which has a diurnal cycle. Since about 70% of IP
addresses send Qihoo 360 Safe trafﬁc in UCSD-13, it strongly in-
ﬂuences the overall duration at the IP address granularity. Without
Qihoo 360 Safe trafﬁc, 80% of IP addresses have a contact duration
of less than one day. However, there is only a small inﬂuence on the
duration of contact at the /24 block, preﬁx, AS, and country granu-
larities. The signal for these aggregated granularities is comprised
of a mix of trafﬁc components and is not dependent on Qihoo 360
Safe.
This analysis shows the potential to make IBR-based inferences
at the /24 blocks, preﬁxes, ASes and countries granularities for the
duration of the datasets. At the IP-address granularity, we observe
the sources throughout the datasets, but this is mostly due to Qihoo
360 Safe trafﬁc.
6.3 Frequency of communication attempts?
To evaluate our ability to perform ﬁne-grained analysis with IBR,
we study the time between observations of trafﬁc from a source.
Figure 6a shows the median time between all sources that we ob-
serve in at least two 1-minute time bins. We observe most countries
all the time: the median time between observations is 1 minute for
92% of countries. At the /24 block and AS levels, the time between
observations is often longer, although the time between contacts at
these granularities is often within 10 minutes. There is a longer
period of time between observations of an IP address: half of IP

bins(UCSD-13). We observe most countries and some ASes in
nearly every time bin, which means we should be able to make
repeated inferences at these source granularities.
small (e.g., 3 seconds between retransmission of Conﬁcker pack-
ets). As a result, our partitioning approach conﬁnes most attempts
to a single time bin, implying that binning does not signiﬁcantly
skew our calculations in the following sections.
6.1 How often do sources send IBR?
The frequency with which we can infer properties of a remote
network depends on how often we receive trafﬁc from that network.
Figure 4 shows the cumulative distribution function of sources ob-
served using 1-hour time bins in UCSD-13. The other datasets
exhibit similar distributions. We observe frequent contact at coarse
source granularities, i.e., countries and some ASes. The values on
the far right of Figure 4 indicate the number of networks that we
observed in every hour UCSD-13, which suggest that inferences
requiring near-constant trafﬁc samples are only possible for ≈80%
of countries and ≈20% of ASes. We also explore (not shown here)
the distribution of number of contacts with time bins of 1-minute
and 1-day. As expected, the CDF curves shift towards more fre-
quent contact as we move to larger time bins.
Approximately 12% of IP addresses are unsuited for repeated
measurements because we observe them in only one 1-minute time
bin, and we observe most IP addresses in less than 11 1-minute time
bins. But as the size of the time bin increases to hours or days, the

Figure 6: Median time between observations (UCSD-13). Most /24 blocks, preﬁxes, ASes, and countries observed multiple times have a
short time between observations (less than 10 minutes), which is desirable for ﬁne-grained analysis. By component, scanning trafﬁc has the
shortest median time between observations.
addresses have a median inter-observation time of more than 13.7
hours. However, for some IP addresses the inter-observation time
is still short (27% of IP addresses have a median inter-observation
time of less then 1 hour).
Figure 6b shows the breakdown of median time between obser-
vations for IP addresses by IBR component. 360 Safe trafﬁc heav-
ily inﬂuences the overall behavior of IP addresses: 50% of IP ad-
dresses associated with 360 Safe have a median time between ob-
servations of greater than 21.2 hours (presumably because they re-
ceive updates about once per day). The median time between obser-
vations is substantially shorter for the other IBR components. As a
result, our ability to conduct ﬁne-grained analysis comes from IBR
components other than Qihoo 360 Safe. Scanning trafﬁc has the
shortest time between observations: for over 90% of IP addresses
the median time between observations is less than 4 minutes. One
type of misconﬁguration causes hosts infected by a botnet to send
C&C trafﬁc to the UCSD darknet and wait either 15 minutes or 1
hour between communication attempts. 360 Safe trafﬁc does not
heavily inﬂuence the time between observations at the /24 block,
AS or country levels.
6.4 Lessons learned
We ﬁnd that many sources repeatedly contact our darknets. We
almost always observe trafﬁc from most countries and many ASes,
e.g., we observe them in nearly all time bins, throughout the entire
observation period, and with a short time between observations. We
continually, but not constantly, observe most /24 blocks and pre-
ﬁxes, e.g., they have a long contact duration but the median time
between observations is often over an hour. At the IP level, a diur-
nal bug in Qihoo 360 Safe generates trafﬁc that heavily inﬂuences
the contact duration and time between intervals. When we exclude
the Qihoo 360 Safe trafﬁc, three-quarters of IP addresses have a
contact duration of less than one day (i.e., we observe the source in
a single day of our 34-day observation period). As a result, IBR is
not well suited for long-term inferences at the IP address granular-
ity.
7. SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
In this section, we examine the dependence of IBR on the time
and site of data collection. We discover a number of differences,
which can be attributed to the properties of inﬂuential IBR com-
ponents. These results (1) conﬁrm that the ﬁndings presented in
the previous sections are representative in terms of number of IBR
sources, the mix of components and visibility, (2) identify aspects
of IBR that limit its ability to make inferences about remote net-
works, and (3) set expectations for the performance of other dark-
nets.
7.1 Dependence on time of collection
Over time, IBR evolves. Not just in terms of its constituent pack-
ets and bytes, as studied by Wustrow et al. [48], but also in terms of
the number of sources sending IBR. To identify times when signiﬁ-
cant changes occurred, we consider: (1) the number of IP addresses
observed per hour for most of 2008–2015 (Figure 7a); (2) the per-
day contribution of the major components3 over the 28-month pe-
riod from January 2012 to April 2014 (Figure 7b); and (3) the total
number of /24 blocks per component during the 2012 and 2013
census (Table 2). Our ability to make network inferences is inﬂu-
enced by both the trends and erratic nature of IBR, including the
following events:
DoS on Spamhaus
• November 2008: Conﬁcker worm outbreak
• March 2010: Signiﬁcant BitTorrent trafﬁc observed
• October 2010: Start of trafﬁc from 360 Safe bug
• March 2013: A spike in Backscatter trafﬁc as the result of a
• February 2014: Increase in backscatter containing responses
• 2012 census vs 2013 census: Due to activity by the Carna
Botnet in 2012, the number of /24 blocks labeled as Bro
Scanners in UCSD-12 is three times the amount in UCSD-13
to DNS queries
3 We extract some IBR components with a pcap signature. When
operating on ﬂow-level data, we use heuristics instead. E.g., for
BitTorrent trafﬁc we use popular message lengths (with low false
positive rate) instead of examining the payload.

Figure 7: Section 7 reviews interesting events represented in these plots.
In particular, we can attribute the increased number of sources in
recent years to bugs and misconﬁgurations in P2P networks (Qihoo
360 Safe and BitTorrent). However, sources sending P2P trafﬁc
generally produce few connection attempts at irregular intervals.
Combined with the decrease in Conﬁcker trafﬁc, this means that
ﬁne-grained analysis (repeated analysis on a short time scale, e.g.,
minutes) is becoming more difﬁcult. To extract a predictable signal,
we may need to analyze only speciﬁc components of IBR [12, 32].
On the other hand, erratic events may serve as an opportunity to
increase visibility. For example, using IBR to assess IPv4 utiliza-
tion during the Spamhaus event yielded more used /24 blocks [21];
locating open resolvers is possible with IBR as the result of an in-
crease in DNS trafﬁc. We group the events above into scanning ac-
tivities (Conﬁcker and Carna), P2P misconﬁgurations or bugs (Bit-
Torrent and Qihoo 360 Safe), and backscatter (DNS responses and
Spamhaus) and discuss each below.
Scanning activities. Both Conﬁcker and Carna increased the
number of sources scanning the darknet. Hosts participating in
scans send many packets to the darknet—which we can leverage
for repeated measurements. However, the Carna scans were a tem-
porary phenomenon and Conﬁcker is slowly declining. This de-
crease, combined with the emergence of BitTorrent and 360 Safe
trafﬁc (generated by sources which make relatively few connection
attempts) results in fewer packets observed per IBR-visible host.
P2P misconﬁgurations/bugs. As a result of misconﬁgurations
or bugs in P2P networks, we observe many sources, though these
sources generally send few packets. We do not receive BitTorrent
