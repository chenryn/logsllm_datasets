compared with fixed devices.31  In fact, the very opposite is true.  While the Coalition has 
submitted a personal/portable device prototype for the Commission to test, no group has 
submitted a prototype of a fixed device.  Thus, the only information available on fixed 
devices consists of theoretical analyses based on hypothetical models.  This information 
pales beside the concrete data the Commission can obtain by testing an actual device.   
IEEE 802.18 and MSTV suggest that because IEEE 802 has not developed 
standards for personal/portable devices, the FCC should not yet authorize such devices, 
but rather should initiate another proceeding to examine personal/portable devices.32  
IEEE 802’s failure to promulgate standards in a timely manner cannot be allowed to 
dictate spectrum policy—the Commission’s role is to establish protection standards, not 
to mandate particular implementation approaches.  The Commission sought information 
about personal/portable devices in the initial NPRM at the same time that it proposed the

use of fixed devices.33  Because the IEEE made the deliberate choice to address only the 
latter, it should not be heard on the former.  More fundamentally, established standards 
are not and should not be a prerequisite for Commission authorization.  In fact, spectrum 
allocation often precedes standardization, as in the cases of Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Ultra-
wideband and myriad other innovative services.  Spectrum allocation is a task for 
government, not for private parties working to develop technology standards which 
may—or may not—advance the public interest. 
Equally unavailing is MSTV’s suggestion that the Commission and industry must 
“gain experience” with fixed devices before personal/portable devices are authorized.34  
Such an argument is a non-sequitur:  fixed devices do not operate under the same 
parameters, nor function in the same way, as personal/portable devices.  Experience with 
fixed devices will add only to the knowledge of fixed devices.  In fact, with the operating 
parameters chosen by the Coalition, personal/portable devices pose less risk than fixed 
devices.  The Commission will be able to obtain sufficient information to authorize 
personal/portable devices, and should do so at the same time as fixed devices, if not 
before.  
Finally, in light of MSTV’s insistence that TV band devices not be authorized for 
sale “at least until February 2009,”35 the Coalition again urges the Commission to

maintain its commitment to allow the sale of such devices as of February 17, 2009.36  As 
the Coalition previously has explained, it has solid roadmaps for delivery of unlicensed 
devices in the TV band in the near term.37  Delaying this deadline will drive resources 
away from this development, vastly decreasing the chances that innovative TV band 
services and devices will be developed.         
In short, opponents of personal/portable devices have not demonstrated any 
reason why the Commission should decline to authorize personal/portable devices or 
undertake yet another rulemaking to consider whether to authorize personal/portable 
devices.  Nor have they demonstrated why personal/portable devices should be 
authorized later than fixed devices.  The Commission should act as soon as possible this 
year to authorize the sale of unlicensed TV band devices—including personal/portable 
devices—by no later than February 17, 2009.   
III. 
UNLICENSED USE OF THE WHITE SPACES WILL PROVIDE THE GREATEST 
BENEFIT TO THE PUBLIC.     
As several parties have observed, this proceeding began with the recognition that 
the “significant growth of and consumer demand for unlicensed wireless broadband 
applications” supported opening up the white spaces for unlicensed use.38  While a 
handful of commenters continue to push for licensed allocation, most of these arguments 
already have been effectively refuted.39  Members of the Coalition and others have 
explained that, while unlicensed use will yield substantial benefits, licensed services are

19
not likely to be deployed extensively, and will not provide greater protection to 
incumbents.40  Accordingly, the Coalition will focus in its reply on a subset of arguments 
offered in response to the Further Notice.     
At the outset, the Coalition notes that a certain inconsistency characterizes the 
advocacy of those favoring licensed use.  On the one hand, these comments suggest that 
extensive use of the white spaces is unworkable.41  Yet these same advocates nevertheless 
insist that the white spaces will create so much value their auction will be extremely 
lucrative, perhaps to the tune of billions of dollars.42   
One party has attempted to resolve this inconsistency (at least in part) by 
proposing that white space licensees be allowed to pay incumbents to accept 
interference.43  This proposal may disenfranchise some TV viewers who would otherwise 
receive acceptable TV pictures today.  It may also cause the broadcasters to violate the 
public trust the Commission has bestowed on them, and to reap inappropriate profit from 
the free spectrum they have been given.  This proposal is even at odds with the 
broadcasters’ insistence throughout this proceeding that the “public’s free over-the-air 
television service” is sacrosanct even at the outer limits of the contour where a television 
signal cannot be decoded.44  Putting aside these inconsistencies and inappropriate

consequences, the arguments advanced by licensed advocates in response to the Further 
Notice fail for two even more fundamental reasons.                       
A. 
Licensed Allocation of the White Spaces Will Not Lead to More 
Efficient Spectrum Use.  
Comments filed by Charles Jackson and Dorothy Robyn and funded by 
Qualcomm make the most extensive case in the record for licensed use of the white 
spaces.45  Jackson and Robyn’s argument is based largely on the work of economist 
Ronald Coase, who has posited that, absent transaction costs, any well defined allocation 
of property rights will lead to an efficient outcome.46  Specifically, under the Coase 
theorem, clear property rights will allow private parties to bargain to internalize negative 
externalities (in this case harmful interference).47  In other words, while Jackson and 
Robyn concede that the “Swiss cheese” nature and other characteristics of the white 
spaces decrease the usefulness of this spectrum, they maintain that “the white space is 
‘junky’ in good part because broadcasters have no incentive or ability to sell or lease 
unneeded bandwidth.”48      
The majority of Jackson and Robyn’s proposal need not be addressed in detail for 
the fundamental reason that its underlying premise—that broadcasters should be entitled 
to sell portions of the TV channel spectrum the Commission has assigned them—is well

beyond the scope of this proceeding.49  The Further Notice sought public comment only 
as to whether the white spaces should be allocated on an unlicensed or licensed basis; it 
certainly did not ask whether the longstanding licensing regime for TV broadcasters 
themselves should be revised.  While the Commission can consider altering the scope of 
broadcasters’ licenses, it must do so within the framework of the notice and comment 
requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act,50 necessitating a further NPRM and 
order in addition to the final order the Commission is scheduled to issue this autumn.51     
However, the Commission need not take this step, as the extremely low 
transaction costs required for successful Coasian bargaining are highly unlikely to occur.  
One alternative proposed by Jackson and Robyn is to establish one nationwide license for 
the white spaces,52 but this proposal is flatly inconsistent with virtually every other 
terrestrial wireless auction to date, and would surely not happen here.53  It is far more 
realistic to assume that the white spaces would be auctioned off in much smaller 
49  It would also be an egregious abuse of the public trust and a violation of the rules under which 
broadcasters have been given licensed spectrum for free.  In fact, the Commission specifically declined 
to address this issue in the Secondary Markets NPRM, noting that it was not inquiring as to whether 
the Commission “should revise any of its policies and rules within the mass media services to facilitate 
more robust secondary markets in the broadcast field.  We make this decision because of the unique 
obligations placed on broadcasters and the public interest considerations applicable in this context.”

geographic regions, greatly increasing both the number of negotiations that must take 
place with each broadcaster, as well as the number of potential negotiators.  Moreover, 
irrespective of whether one or several licenses are auctioned, the winner would have to 
negotiate with numerous high and low power TV station owners, wireless microphone 
operators, TV translator operators, and potentially Mexico and Canada.  Under any 
scenario, transaction costs are likely to be astronomical, to say nothing of the high 
likelihood that hold-outs will occur.54      
Perhaps recognizing the substantive and procedural defects in their Coasian 
bargaining argument, Jackson and Robyn also maintain that the white spaces could still 
be licensed absent bargaining, as licensees could operate under the default restrictions 
that otherwise would be imposed on unlicensed use.55  This is true enough, but such a 
proposal would run afoul of the many concerns the Commission raised in the Further 
Notice about allocating white spaces spectrum on a licensed basis.56  In fact, absent the 
ability to bribe incumbents to accept interference and injure their customers, the only 
efficiency arguments licensed advocates have mustered are that protection criteria may be 
less rigorous under a licensed regime and that the “certainty” of a white spaces license 
would compel more infrastructure investment.57  Each of these arguments fails.

First, licensed advocates have offered no reason to believe that “the FCC would 
be likely to impose … less protective interference standards for licensed white-space 
operations.”58  Certainly, the Commission has not proposed different operating 
parameters for licensed and unlicensed use.  Because devices will follow the same laws 
of physics irrespective of whether they are licensed, a licensing regime does not decrease 
the risk of harmful interference.59  There is no justification for watering down the harmful 
interference protection criteria the Commission will set, because if the Commission does 
so there is substantial risk that harmful interference to over the air broadcasters will 
occur.  Indeed, if the Commission’s rules were to be relaxed for licensed use, licensees 
would transmit at higher power, increasing the likelihood of interference relative to 
unlicensed use.        
With respect to infrastructure investment, many of the uses for which the TV 
white spaces are uniquely suited, such as neighborhood and municipal mesh networks, 
require little to no infrastructure investment.  Moreover, the substantial number of WISPS 
operating in existing unlicensed spectrum demonstrates that licenses are not a 
prerequisite to deploying infrastructure when it is required.  This history of investment in 
the unlicensed spectrum refutes the speculation that a licensed regime will lead to greater 
investment.  
Most importantly, the uncertain nature of rights allocated under a white space 
license would negate whatever unique investment incentive a license would otherwise 
provide.  Indeed, even advocates of licensed have conceded that “White Space licensees 
58  Jackson/Robyn Comments at 47. 
59  See Coalition Comments at 25-28. 
24
could lose their ability to operate on some or all of the spectrum.”60  While these 
advocates contend that “the best way to take account of that risk is to let the market 
decide,”61 they neglect to explain what happens when the market decides that a license is 
too “junky” to provide a return on investment.  In these cases, the spectrum will lie fallow 
when it could be tapped for myriad unlicensed uses, and the public will suffer.            
Because the white spaces are power-restricted, have a lower status than incumbent 
operations (including wireless microphones), and are subject to substantial variation 
based on time and geography,62 the white spaces would be by far the most restricted 
wireless broadband spectrum ever auctioned and licensed.  The Commission was correct 
when it suggested that unlicensed uses may be “better able to dynamically adapt to a 
shifting spectrum environment characterized by low power operation,”63 and it should 
reaffirm its initial decision to allocate the white spaces on an unlicensed basis.  
B. 
Advocates of Licensing Dramatically Understate the Value of the 
White Spaces for Unlicensed Use.    
Notwithstanding the Commission’s recognition of the growing consumer demand 
for unlicensed wireless spectrum64 and the specific proposals of a number of comments 
for unlicensed use,65 advocates of licensed use continue to maintain that there is “no

also generally NAF Comments.    
25
documented need for additional unlicensed spectrum.”66  This is simply not the case:  of 
the “beachfront” spectrum below 2 GHz, only 26 MHz is available for unlicensed 
broadband use, as opposed to 1,974 MHz for federal or licensed use.  Indeed, there is 
absolutely no unlicensed spectrum available for wireless broadband in the spectrum 
below 900 MHz—one of the core inquiries in this proceeding.            
Licensed advocates by and large have acknowledged the inherent desirability of 
TV spectrum due to its superior propagation characteristics, but nevertheless suggest that 
unlicensed users may actually be better off with the spectrum allocations at 2.4 and 5 
GHz67 with their inferior propagation characteristics.  This argument presupposes that 
future unlicensed use would merely mimic existing unlicensed deployments, but this will 
not be the case.  For example, in addition to short range applications such as media 
distribution (which will be far more robust than they are at 2.4 or 5 GHz), the Coalition 
envisions a number of “medium range” applications based on neighborhood self-
organizing mesh networks.68  These types of applications simply are not possible at the 
existing higher frequencies allocated to unlicensed devices. 
Significantly, the Commission has recognized that the white spaces are capable of 
providing not only cheaper and more widely available broadband, but also a host of “new 
and innovative types of devices and services for businesses and consumers.”69  The 
response of licensed advocates is telling.  For example, Jackson and Robyn concede that

“unlicensed use of the 2.4 GHz band has spawned WiFi and other major innovations,” 
but at the same time reject the notion that “additional unlicensed spectrum will create 
significant new opportunities for innovation, given the large supply that already exists.”70  
But they have no satisfactory explanation of why unlicensed innovation is suddenly going 
to cease.  Of course, as of today the supply of spectrum with the superior propagation 
characteristics of the TV band available for unlicensed broadband use is not large—it is 
zero.  The upcoming DTV auctions guarantee that much of this desirable spectrum will 
be made available on a licensed basis.  The Commission should reaffirm its initial 
decision to allocate the white spaces on an unlicensed basis, thus ensuring that the unique 
properties of TV band spectrum are available for both licensed and unlicensed use.   
Finally, it bears repeating that only an unlicensed allocation will ensure that 
available white spaces spectrum can be accessed throughout the country.  While licensed
