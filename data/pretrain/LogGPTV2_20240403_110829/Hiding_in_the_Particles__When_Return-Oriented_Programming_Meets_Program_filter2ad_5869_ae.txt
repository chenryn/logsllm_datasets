### Simplification and Processing Time
As \( k \) increases, the simpler functions require a higher processing time compared to when they were cracked for smaller values of \( k \).

### Code Coverage
The last column of Table II lists the number of functions for which S2E covered all the CFG (Control Flow Graph) split and join points annotated by Tigress and reachable in the native counterparts. Given the relatively small size of the functions, we consider coverage as an "all or nothing" goal, similar to [14] and [38]. As discussed in §III-A, full coverage is not always necessary for secret finding (neither achieving G2 is sufficient for G1). For most VM configurations, the functions for which S2E fully explored the original CFG are slightly more than those for which it recovered the secret. ROPk, even for \( k = 0.05 \), impedes achieving G2 for nearly half of the functions, leaving only a few (6-11) within the reach of S2E for higher \( k \) values.

### Deployability
To conclude our evaluation, we investigate how our methods can handle real-world code bases in three aspects: the efficacy of the rewriting, runtime overhead for CPU-intensive code, and an obfuscation case study on a popular encoding function.

#### 1. Coverage
We start by assessing how our implementation handles the code base of coreutils (v8.28, compiled with gcc 6.3.0 -O1). This suite, popular in software testing, serves as a suitable benchmark due to its diverse code patterns. Using symbol and size information, we identified 1354 unique functions across its corpus of 107 programs. We skipped 119 functions shorter than the 22 bytes required by the pivoting sequence (§IV-B3). Our rewriter could transform 1175 out of the remaining 1235 functions (95.1%, or a 0.801 fraction if normalized by size). There were 40 failures during register allocation due to high pressure (§IV-C), 19 for code like `push rsp` and `push qword [rsp + imm]` that the translation step does not yet handle (§IV-B1), and 1 for failed CFG reconstruction. As informal validation of functional correctness, we ran the test suite of the coreutils over the obfuscated program instances, obtaining no mismatches in the output.

#### 2. Overhead
While heavy-duty obfuscation often targets one-off or infrequent computations, we also studied performance overhead. We used the clbg suite [73], commonly used in compiler research to benchmark the effects of code transformations (e.g., [74], [75]). As a reference, we considered 2VM-IMPlast, the fastest configuration for double virtualization with implicit VPC loads (1VM is too easy to circumvent, and 3VM brings prohibitive overheads, i.e., over 5-6 orders of magnitude in our tests). Figure 5 presents slowdowns for ROPk using a stacked bar chart layout, as its overhead increases with \( k \). With the exception of `sp-norm`, which sees repeated pivoting events from a ROP tight loop calling a short-lived ROP subroutine, ROPk is consistently faster than 2VM-IMPlast for \( k \leq 0.5 \), and no slower than 1.81x (b-trees that repeatedly call `malloc` and `free`) in the most expensive setting \( k = 1.00 \).

#### 3. Case Study
Finally, we studied the resilience and slowdowns of selected obfuscation configurations on the reference implementation of the popular base64 encoding algorithm [76]. Base64 features byte manipulations and table lookups relevant for transformation code of variable complexity that users may wish to obfuscate. An important consideration is that, in the presence of table lookups, using concrete values for input-dependent pointers is no longer effective (and even counterproductive) for DSE to explore relevant states. We thus opted for the per-page theory-of-arrays memory model of S2E [11], [77]. This choice allowed S2E to recover a 6-byte input in about 102 seconds for the original implementation, 180 seconds for 2VM-IMPlast, 281 seconds for 2VM-IMPall, and 1622 seconds for 3VM-IMPlast. A budget of 8 hours was insufficient for 3VM-IMPall, as well as for ROPk already for \( k = 0 \) (when only P1 is enabled). As anticipated in §V-E, the aliasing from P1 on RSP updates can impact the handling of memory in DSE executors in ways that the synthetic functions of §VII-B did not (as they do not use table lookups). Regarding code slowdowns, ROPk seems to bring rather tolerable execution times: for a rough comparison, execution takes 0.299 ms for ROP0.25 and 1.791 ms for ROP1.00, while for VM settings we measured 1.63 ms for 2VM-IMPlast, 347 ms for 2VM-IMPall, 668 ms for 3VM-IMPlast, and 2211 s for the impractical 3VM-IMPall.

### Concluding Remarks
Adding to the appealing properties of ROP against reverse engineering, our experimental results lead us to believe that our approach can:
1. Hinder many popular deobfuscation approaches, as well as symbiotic combinations aimed at improving scalability.
2. Significantly increase the resources needed by automated techniques that remain viable, with slowdowns ≥ 50x for the vast majority of the 72 targets for both end goals G1-2.
3. Bring multiple configuration opportunities for resilience (and overhead) goals to the program protection landscape.

While obfuscation research has yet to declare a clear winner and automated attacks keep evolving, our technique is orthogonal to most other code obfuscations, meaning it can be applied on top of already obfuscated code (§IV-C). We have followed established practices [13] of analyzing our obfuscation individually and on function units, but in future work, we would like to expand both points: studying mutually reinforcing combinations with other obfuscations and applying ROP rewriting inter-procedurally, removing the stack-switching step during transfers between ROP functions, since our design allows that. Finally, to optimize the composition of symbolic registers when instantiating P3, we may look at def-use chains as suggested by [14] for FOR cases, exploring analyses like [65] necessary to obtain the required information.
