User: I've googled and googled, and everything I've seen has directed me to py2exe. I've looked at it and downloaded the latest version of it, but it says I have to have Python 2.6 to use it! Does this mean I have to use Python 2.6 rather than 3.3.3, or is there an alternative to py2exe? 
Edit: Thanks! I can now use cxFreeze, but is there a way I can compile it further so I don't have to run it from a different folder? Or should I create a batch file calling the .exe from the command line and convert the batch file to an executable?
Assistant: On most *nix systems it is sufficient to put #!/usr/bin/python as the first line of the main script and then chmod +x /path/to/script.py.
