User: PyDev has a feature to terminate all running processes. Does PyCharm have something similar? I only see a "stop" button in the menu.
Assistant: In PyCharm, if you click on the bottom right ... "Running x processes", then x number of windows pop up. (Here, x is the number of processing running.) 
Each has an X button to kill the process.
