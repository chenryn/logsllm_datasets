Table VI shows the average latency for accessing the sites
using Firefox. The proxy generally increases page load latency
by 7.4–18.0%. However, due to content variability, two of the
sites load faster through the proxy.
In four of these cases, the proxy works without ever needing
to send the authenticated session information back to the
client. However, for npr.org and guardiannews.org, the proxy
must return to the client some of the session cookies for the
websites so the browser can indicate that the user is logged
in. Giving session cookies to the client is unfortunate because
depending on how a site formats its cookies, a user could
potentially steal the cookie and attempt to change the login
information related to the account. However, passing cookies
is safe for these two sites because they require an additional
reauthentication before account details may be modiﬁed.
VII. RELATED WORK
Our work continues research into anonymous creden-
tials [9], which allow access control while maintaining
anonymity. We describe several themes of research in anony-
mous credential schemes and show the point that our system
occupies in design space.
A. Flexible policy support
Handling credential abuse has been a central
theme of
much of the work on anonymous credentials. However, abuse
of credentials takes on different meaning in many of the
different systems. Early work (e.g. [13]) focused around e-
cash [10], where credentials represented units of currency.
Here the relevant policy is to prevent double spending of the
same currency.
Recent work has focused on anonymous blacklisting systems
(e.g. [31], [17]). In these systems, a service is capable of
blacklisting a user, excluding her from future interactions
with the service, based on her actions during a transaction.
However, many anonymous blacklisting systems leave black-
listing decisions completely up to the service, as opposed
to e-cash based systems, which only allow the service to
enforce a speciﬁc policy. Some work [27] has been done
to hold services to particular policies, though this work uses
mechanisms beyond pure cryptography (trusted hardware).

Anon-Pass chooses to trade policy ﬂexibility for perfor-
mance. Nonetheless, we have shown (§V) that Anon-Pass is
ﬂexible enough to support a wide variety of applications.
B. Efﬁciency
Stubblebine, Syverson, and Goldschlag [29] propose unlink-
able serial transactions to handle anonymous subscription. In
their scheme, when users register they receive a blind signa-
ture. A user can use this blind signature to begin a transaction
and receives a new signature upon transaction end. However,
this means the system must store and be able to efﬁciently
search through all used tokens while the system key material
remains unchanged (likely the period of a subscription, which
could be on order of months). Blanton [2] uses more advanced
cryptographic techniques to support client secret expiration,
but incurs the same space requirements. Anon-Pass requires
only the ability to store tokens for a ﬁxed number of epochs,
which is storage proportional to the number of requests that
can occur in a few minutes, rather than months.
While anonymous blacklisting techniques could possibly be
used to provide anonymous subscription (i.e. by temporar-
ily blacklisting logged-on clients), anonymous blacklisting
schemes often suffer from poor scalability. For example,
BLAC [31] requires time linear in the number of blacklisted
users to check the blacklist. PEREA [32] reduces this to linear
in the number of logged in users. Even the latest in this series
of work BLACR [1] supports 26-38 authentications/minute
on an 8-core machine with 5000 blacklisted users. Anon-Pass
requires only hash table lookups to check for double usage,
otherwise operations are constant in the number of registered
and logged in users. With Anon-Pass on a 4-core machine,
our micro-benchmark sustains almost 500 login operations a
second, and scales up to 12,000 concurrent users in the music
streaming benchmark.
Nymble [17] improves performance of blacklisting systems
by adding a trusted third party that can revoke anonymity as
needed. Follow-on projects try to divide trust among multiple
parties [16] or reduce involvement of trusted third parties [20].
Anon-Pass maintains efﬁciency without needing any trusted
third party.
Most papers from the cryptographic literature do not include
implementations and benchmarks. More applied papers still do
not include system use in actual scenarios. In this paper we
describe how anonymous subscription primitives affect system
performance in more realistic scenarios.

C. Zero-Knowledge Proofs, Proofs of Knowledge
Consider an interactive protocol between a prover P and
veriﬁer V, where the output is one bit from the veriﬁer. We let
(cid:5)P(x),V(y)(cid:6) = 1 (resp. = 0) denote the event that V outputs 1
(resp. 0) in the interaction, which we refer to as “accepting”
(resp., “rejecting”). This forms an interactive proof system for
a language L if V runs in probabilistic polynomial time and
the following properties are satisﬁed:
• Completeness. If x ∈ L, then Pr[(cid:5)P(x),V(x)(cid:6) = 1] is
negligibly close to 1.
• Soundness. If x /∈ L, then Pr[(cid:5)P∗(x),V(x)(cid:6) = 1] is
negligible for arbitrary P∗.
A distribution ensemble {X(a)}a∈S is a function from
S ⊂ {0, 1}∗ to probability distributions. Two distribution
ensembles X = {X(a)}a∈S, Y = {Y (a)}a∈S are compu-
tationally indistinguishable if for all probabilistic polynomial-
time algorithms D and all a ∈ S
(cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:2) Pr[D(X(a), a) = 1] − Pr[D(Y (a), a) = 1]
(cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:2) < μ(|a|),
for some negligible function μ.
An interactive proof system for a language L is (computa-
tionally) zero knowledge, if for every probabilistic polynomial
time interactive algorithm V∗ there exists a probabilistic
polynomial-time algorithm Sim (a simulator) such that the
following two distribution ensembles are computationally in-
distinguishable:
V∗ (x)}x∈L
• {viewP
• {Sim(x)}x∈L
where viewP
V∗ (x) is a random variable describing the content
of the random tape of V∗ and the messages V∗ receives during
interaction with P on common input x.
Let R ⊆ {0, 1}∗×{0, 1}∗ be a binary relation. Deﬁne LR =
(cid:3)
x : ∃w | (x, w) ∈ R
. We say that R is an NP-relation if
• There exists a polynomial p such that for all (x, w) ∈ R,
|w| ≤ p(|x|).
• There exists a polynomial-time algorithm for deciding
(cid:4)
membership in R.
If (x, w) ∈ R, we refer to w as a witness for x.
knowledge if the following conditions hold:
A interactive proof system for a language L is a proof of
• Non-triviality. There is an interactive algorithm P such
that for every (x, w) ∈ R, P ((cid:5)P(x, w),V(x)(cid:6) = 1) = 1.
• Validity. There exists a probabilistic interactive algorithm
K such that for every interactive algorithm P∗, every
(x, y) ∈ R, if p(x, y, r) is the probability that V accepts
∗(x, y),V(x)(cid:6) when P∗ has random tape r, then

APPENDIX A
BACKGROUND
A. Bilinear Groups
Let G, GT be two cyclic groups of the same prime order q,
and let g be a generator of G. We say G is bilinear if there is
an efﬁciently computable map e(·,·) : G×G → GT satisfying
1) Bilinearity. e(ga, gb) = e(g, g)ab.
2) Non-degeneracy. e(g, g) (cid:7)= 1.
This map is also called a pairing. Note gT ≡ e(g, g) is then
a generator of GT .
B. Complexity Assumptions
We describe the LRSW and DDHI assumptions in a
group G. Note that both assumptions imply that computing
discrete logarithms in G is hard.
LRSW assumption [7]. Let G be a group of prime order q,
with generator g. The LRSW assumption is that any efﬁcient
algorithm A succeeds in the following experiment with neg-
ligible probability:
1) Choose x ← Zq and y ← Zq, and give g, X = gx, and
Y = gy to A.
2) A can query an oracle that, on input m ∈ Zq, chooses
A ← G \ {1} and returns (A, Ay, Ax+mxy). We denote
by M the set of inputs on which A queries its oracle.
3) A succeeds if it outputs (m, A, B, C) with m /∈ M and
such that A (cid:7)= 1, B = Ay, and C = Ax+mxy.
Decisional Difﬁe-Hellman inversion (DDHI) assump-
tion [24]. Let G be a group of prime order q, with generator g.
The DDHI assumption is that for any efﬁcient algorithm A and
any polynomial t the following is negligible:
