User: In the Windows environment, how to use the PowerShell language to implement file compression and decompression functions?
Assistant: Compressed files: Use the Compress-Archive command to compress files using PowerShell. The specific syntax is as follows: Compress-Archive [-Path] <String[]> [-DestinationPath] <String> [-CompressionLevel {Optimal | Fastest | NoCompression }] [- Update] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>] Among them: -Path: the path of the file or folder to be compressed, you can use wildcards to match multiple files or folders. -DestinationPath: The storage path of the compressed file. -CompressionLevel: Compression level, optional values Optimal (default value, best compression rate), Fastest (fastest compression) and NoCompression (no compression). -Update: whether to update only compressed files, omitting means no update. For example, to compress all the files in the D:\test directory as the test.zip archive: Compress-Archive -Path D:\test\* -DestinationPath D:\test\test.zip Unzip the files: Use PowerShell to unzip the files using Expand -Archive command, the specific syntax is as follows: Expand-Archive [-Path] <String> [-DestinationPath] <String> [-Force] [-PassThru] [-Confirm] [-WhatIf] [<CommonParameters>] Among them: -Path : The path of the compressed file that needs to be decompressed. -DestinationPath: The storage path of the decompressed file. -Force: Whether to forcibly replace the existing file with the same name, omitting means not mandatory. -PassThru: Whether to return the decompressed file, omitting means not to return. For example, unzip the test.zip archive to the D:\test directory: Expand-Archive -Path D:\test\test.zip -DestinationPath D:\test\
