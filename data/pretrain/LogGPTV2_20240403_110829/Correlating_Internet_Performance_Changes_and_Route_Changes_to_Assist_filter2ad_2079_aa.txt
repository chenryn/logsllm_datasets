## Abstract
With the increasing need for global data-intensive scientific collaborations, there is a growing demand for transferring large amounts of data to and from repositories around the world. To facilitate these transfers, high-speed, reliable, and predictable networks are essential. Continuous performance monitoring is necessary to ensure network quality. One tool that has been successfully used for this purpose is IEPM-BW [1]. Building on the experience gained from throughput monitoring in IEPM-BW, we developed ABwE [2], a tool that enables quick (< 1 second) and low-impact (40 packets) measurements of available bandwidth. Using ABwE, we have been able to rapidly detect significant changes in available bandwidth on production links up to 1 Gbps and report this information to Network Operations Centers (NOCs) for repair. This paper discusses the set of tools and their effectiveness, along with examples of their application.

## 1. Introduction
The growth of global data-intensive scientific collaborations necessitates the transfer of large volumes of data to and from repositories and collaborator sites worldwide. High-speed, efficient, and predictable networks are required to support these transfers. These networks need continuous performance monitoring to ensure optimal operation. One tool that has proven effective for analyzing and monitoring critical paths is IEPM-BW [1]. Based on our experience with IEPM-BW, we developed ABwE [2], a tool that facilitates rapid (< 1 second) and low-impact (40 packets) measurements of available bandwidth. Using ABwE, we can quickly (within minutes) identify significant changes in available bandwidth on production links with up to 1 Gbps bottlenecks. Investigating such changes, particularly degradations, we often find that they are associated with route changes. Once a significant performance change is detected, the main challenge for the end-user (e.g., a network administrator at an end-site) is to gather relevant information to identify the magnitude of the change, the time(s) it occurred, the before and after routes, and to see if the change affects multiple paths. Additionally, common points of change in the paths and the probable relevant Internet Service Providers (ISPs) must be identified, and this information reported to the appropriate NOCs. In our experience, once this information is provided, NOCs respond quickly with the cause of the change and often a fix. We have developed a set of tools to facilitate this process. These tools measure traceroutes at regular intervals, record them in an archive, and provide simple visualization, navigation, and integration with other tools such as ABwE and IEPM-BW, and a topology display. This paper will present this set of tools and discuss their effectiveness, along with examples of their use.

## 2. History and Methodology
In November 2001, a monitoring host with a 1 GE interface was set up at SLAC. Remote hosts (35-45) at collaborating sites around the world were chosen as targets for network performance tests. SSH [3] accounts were set up on these remote hosts to enable communication. Several tools were evaluated, and PING, IPERF [4] (TCP/UDP transfer tool), BBFTP [5] (file transfer tool), BBCP [6] (another file transfer tool), QIPERF [7], and GridFTP [8] were selected. Currently, at regular intervals, PING, TCP transfers (using IPERF), file transfers (using BBFTP and GridFTP), and ABwE measurements are performed. ABwE measurements are made in both forward and reverse directions. Additionally, forward and reverse traceroutes are run approximately every 10-12 minutes between SLAC and all remote hosts. The results of these tests and traceroutes are analyzed to identify unique routes, assign route numbers, identify significant route changes, and convert the data into more useful formats (web browsable for users, text format for emails to ISPs, log format for debugging, etc.). The data is stored in a database with measurement times and other test parameters for access by Web Services [9], MonALISA [10], and other visualization and analysis tools.

## 3. Visualization
The simplest visualization technique involves time series graphs of the ping minimum and average Round Trip Times (RTTs), the results of the achievable and available bandwidth tests, file transfer throughputs, and indicators on the time series graphs that denote when the route to or from a node has changed. This allows for visual correlation of significant changes in RTT, available and achievable bandwidth, and route changes in one or both directions. Figure 1 provides an example of this. These graphs can be dense, but options are available to plot individual components and vary the time scale.

As seen in Figure 1, route changes frequently do not cause throughput changes, but throughput changes often correlate with route changes. Table 1 summarizes visually identifiable route and throughput changes for 32 nodes monitored via IEPM-BW for the period 11/28/03 – 2/2/04. Often, a change in throughput is associated with a route change, suggesting that the first thing to check for when evaluating throughput changes would be a route change.

**Figure 1.** Time series plot with route changes indicated. The asterisks along the top axis indicate forward traceroute changes, and the asterisks along the bottom axis indicate reverse route changes. Note the correspondence between throughput changes and forward route changes.

We also observe, as expected, that many routes to remote hosts share subroutes, and a route change to one host often corresponds with changes in the routes to other hosts. A web-accessible daily summary page (Figure 2) is created and updated throughout the day. At the top of the page are links to "Yesterday’s Summary," today’s "Reverse Traceroute Summary," and the directory containing historical traceroute summaries. Below these links is the traceroute summary table, which provides "at a glance" visualization of traceroute change patterns. This facilitates the observation of synchronized route changes for multiple hosts in cases where a common subroute changes for some of them.
