UPDATE: I've solved the problem but I am now filing a bug report instead of a
request for help. See below.
**Original request for help:**
  * Electron version: v0.37.5
  * Operating system: Mac OS X 10.11.4
I'm building my first Electron app.
My WebView, which was working just fine, has suddenly stopped loading URLs
and/or data URLs.
I was distracted and didn't notice what change if any I made at the time the
WebView stopped working.
In my `index.html`, I'm trying each of the following, one at a time:  
``  
``
The overall structure of my `index.html` is:
    div display:table
        div display:table-row
            div display:table-cell
                sidebar content
            div display:table-cell
                div wrapper (height & width set to 100%)
                    webview
In my `index.css` I have:
    webview {
      autosize: on;
      min-width: 800px; // the width of the enclosing div's parent
      min-height: 600px; // the ehight of the enclosing div's parent
      background-color: blue; // just so I can visually check the webview's dimensions
      display: inline-block;
    }
My `main.js` instantiates the browser window in the usual way:
      mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({
        width: 1050, 
        height: 622,
        resizable: false,
      });
The window and its sidebar content load and display correctly.
The webview displays with a blue background in the desired location and with
the desired dimensions.
However, it contains no content -- neither the "Hello world" message nor the
Example.com website.
When I change the webview to an iframe, the content does load and the iframe
is in the correct location, though smaller than intended.
When I made a new copy of `electron-quick-start` and paste in just the webview
code, it initially displays the "Hello world" message and/or the Example.com
website, but when I paste in the entire HTML and CSS it stops working. And now
it's stopped working full-stop.
I've linked to the code in full case it helps:
  * app/html
  * app/index.css
  * main.js
  * package.json
What process would I follow to debug this?
**UPDATE & BUG REPORT**
I solved this by inserted random non-empty script into the of the HTML
(inspired by an earlier bug report about an earlier version of Electron that
required a script in for to render correctly. This appears to to be a new bug.
Incidentally, I also had to comment out `display: inline-block;` in the
stylesheet for the webview to be the right height and width once it started
displaying again.
