### Hosting and Operating Costs Analysis

To accurately compute the operating costs, we first need to determine the total number of Private Blog Network (PBN) sites hosted by Marketing1on1. Given that our large-scale analysis only includes a sample of domains, we start by identifying all backlinks to marketing1onone.com using the service provided by Majestic. We then visit each page linking to the PBN provider’s website to verify the presence of the link and count the number of other domains linked from these pages. A domain is considered part of the Marketing1on1 network if it links to fewer than 50 unique domains. This step is crucial because manual inspection of a sample of backlink pages revealed instances where the marketing1onone.com domain was used in comment abuse.

In total, we identified 1,544 domains likely belonging to the Marketing1on1 network. Given that each package typically includes at least 10 links created across the network, this should not significantly affect the revenue estimation. Assuming an operating cost of $20 per month per domain (shared hosting options can be as low as $5 per month, but the PBN provider diversifies its hosting, so not all are the cheapest), the total operating cost is $30,880 per month. This results in a monthly profit of approximately $140,000.

### Comparison with Other Black-Hat SEO Techniques

Interestingly, the profits generated by a single PBN are comparable to those from trending keyword abuse, which boosts the ranking of Made-for-Adsense (MFA) websites and sites promoting fake antivirus software [16]. However, unlike most other black-hat SEO techniques, the revenue for PBN operators primarily comes from their paying customers. Consequently, the findings of Wang et al. [31], which suggest that undermining malicious monetization techniques is an effective response against black-hat SEO campaigns, do not apply to PBNs.

#### Black-Hat SEO Techniques

A wide variety of black-hat SEO techniques aim to deceive search engines to rank promoted websites higher. Most of these techniques manipulate specific aspects of the ranking algorithm. For example, keyword stuffing involves crafting web pages with many specific keywords for popular searches [19]. These techniques often exhibit behavior different from typical web pages, making them relatively easy to detect. In 2011, John et al. reported on a technique where trending keywords were abused to lure users to malicious web pages [8]. Moore et al. found that an update to Google’s ranking algorithm rendered this technique largely ineffective [16]. Liao et al. later reported on a new keyword-based black-hat SEO technique involving long-tail keywords on cloud-hosted pages [14]. Du et al. explored another novel SEO technique, abusing wildcard DNS entries to create virtually infinite sites [3].

The private blog networks (PBNs) we report on differ from these prior findings in that they do not manipulate specific intricacies of the ranking algorithm. Instead, they leverage the intended function of the ranking algorithm, favoring websites with incoming links from authoritative sources, which are artificially created and maintained by the PBN operator.

Another class of nefarious SEO techniques exploits existing reputable websites. Examples include comment spam, where miscreants post comments with links to their own websites [34], and profile abuse, where spun content is added to the biography section of automatically registered user accounts [35]. Some adversaries even compromise existing websites to place SEO-boosting content [12, 31]. In contrast, PBN operators orchestrate their own websites and do not directly exploit or interfere with other sites.

#### Detection of SEO Abuse

In 2000, Davison introduced a method based on the C4.5 decision tree algorithm to detect nepotistic links [2]. Subsequent research has focused on detecting "spam links" and various web spamming techniques. For instance, Gyöngyi et al. reported on web spamming, where malefactors create thousands of links with related keywords to rank higher [6]. Wu and Davison developed a technique to detect link farms, networks of densely connected websites promoting a target site [33]. Various new detection techniques have been proposed, leveraging topological relationships, machine learning, and graph regularization [1, 4, 36].

Prior work has mainly focused on detecting link spam, which creates an abundance of interconnected links. PBNs, however, try to resemble regular websites and carefully create links that appear legitimate. As such, web spam and PBNs exhibit different properties, making detection methods not directly interchangeable.

### Conclusion

By ranking higher in search results, website owners can gain a significant advantage over competitors. While following standard guidelines to optimize a website for search engines, some administrators may resort to deceptive SEO methods, such as purchasing artificially created backlinks. Through an exploratory experiment, we ordered several backlink packages and found that many of these backlinks are created through PBNs.

In this paper, we present a comprehensive and in-depth analysis of the PBN ecosystem. We propose a novel methodology to detect PBN sites, combining a guided search to identify likely PBN websites and a multi-step classifier that leverages both content-based and linking-based features. Starting from a limited seed set of PBN sites, we conducted a large-scale experiment on 52,777 websites, detecting 3,552 PBN sites. Our analysis shows that backlink providers employ various measures to avoid detection, indicative of the ongoing arms race between search engines and PBN owners. Improving detection mechanisms, such as through our proposed methodology, can drive up the operational costs of these services and reduce financial incentives to operate PBNs. Despite the measures taken by backlink providers, several techniques remain effective at detecting clusters. We find that a single PBN network can consist of several hundred websites, generating a revenue of more than $100,000 per month.
