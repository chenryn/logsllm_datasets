hosting needs, which are considerably cheaper. To compute the
operating costs, we first need to determine the total number of
PBN sites hosted by Marketing1on1 (because of the sampling step
in our large-scale analysis, not all domains are included in our
dataset). For this, we first find all backlinks to marketing1on1.com,
using the service provided by Majestic. Next, we visit all pages
that link to the PBN provider’s website and determine whether
the link is still present, and count the number of other domains
that are linked to. We only consider a domain to be part of the
Marketing1on1 network when there are less than 50 unique do-
mains linked on that site. The latter step is important because a
manual inspection of sample of the backlink pages showed several
instances where the marketing1on1.com domain was used in com-
ment abuse. In total, we find 1,544 domains that likely belong to the
Marketing1on1 network. Note that because for every package at
least 10 links created throughout the network, it is unlikely that this
would significantly affect the revenue estimation. Considering an
operating cost of $20/month/domain (shared hosting options can
be found for $5/month, but we find that the PBN provider tries to
diversify its hosting, so not only the cheaper options are available),
we find an operating cost of $30,880, and thus a monthly profit of
approximately $140,000.
Interestingly, the profits generated by a single PBN are in the
same range as that of trending keywords abuse, which boosts the
ranking of Made-for-Adsense (MFA) websites and sites promoting
fake anti-virus software [16]. However, in contrast to most other
black-hat SEO techniques, the revenue made by PBN operators
largely originates from their paying customers. Consequently, the
findings of Wang et al., namely that undermining the malicious
monetization techniques are a potent response against black-hat
SEO campaigns [31], are no longer applicable to PBNs.
7 RELATED WORK
7.1 Black-hat SEO techniques
There exists a wide variety of black-hat SEO techniques that aim to
deceive search engines such that the promoted website is ranked
higher in the search results. The vast majority of the black-hat
SEO techniques that have been studied to date try to manipulate
a specific aspect of the ranking algorithm. For example, the con-
tents of web pages may be specifically crafted such that it includes
many specific keywords for popular searches (a technique known
as keyword-stuffing) [19]. Because these techniques exhibit behav-
ior different from typical web pages, they are relatively quickly
detected by search engines and miscreants have to resort to new
techniques. For instance, in 2011, John et al. report on a technique
where trending keywords were abused to lure users to malicious
web page [8]. As a part of a longitudinal study by Moore et al., the
researchers found that an update to Google’s ranking algorithm
rendered this SEO technique largely ineffective [16]. Later, in 2016,
Liao et al. report on a new keyword-based black-hat SEO technique,
namely including long-tail keywords on pages hosted by cloud web
hosting services such as Amazon S3 or Google Drive [14]. This tech-
nique abuses the intuition that a search engine will give preference
to results that contain a more specific search keyword. Du et al.
explore another novel SEO technique, where wildcard DNS entries
are abused to create virtually infinite sites in order to deceive search
engines [3]. The novel black-hat SEO technique we report on in
this paper, private blog networks, differs from the prior findings
in the sense that it does not try to manipulate specific intricacies
of the ranking algorithm. Instead, it tries to manipulate the search
results by leveraging the way the ranking algorithm is intended
to function, i.e. favoring websites that have incoming links from
authoritative sources (these are the websites which are artificially
created and maintained by the PBN operator).
Another class of nefarious SEO techniques try to exploit existing
websites, which are already considered reputable by search engines.
Examples of these types of abuse include comment spam, where
miscreants post comments to blog posts with a link to their own
website [34], profile abuse, where spun content is added to the
biography section of an automatically registered user account [35].
In some instances, adversaries go as far as to compromise existing
websites and place SEO-boosting on them [12, 31]. In contrast to
these techniques, we find that PBN operators orchestrate their own
websites, and do not directly exploit or interfere with other sites.
7.2 Detection of SEO abuse
In 2000, Davison was the first to introduce a method, based on the
C4.5 decision tree algorithm, to detect nepotistic links, i.e., links
purposefully created to mislead search engines [2]. In the following
years, many researchers have reported on “spam links,” and tech-
niques to detect them. For instance, in 2004, Gyöngyi et al. report on
web spamming, a technique in which malefactors create thousands
of links containing a large number of related keywords in order to
rank higher in search engines [6]. In a follow-up work, they explore
the effect of various types of web spamming on the Page Rank
algorithm, which was at that time used by Google [5]. Similarly, in
2005, Wu and Davison introduce a technique to detect link farms,
a network of densely connected websites that aim to promote a
target website [33]. Among other things, they find that 9% of search
queries have at least one spam page in the top 10 results, showing
that at that time link farms were still highly effective.
Over the following three years, various new detection techniques
have been proposed [1, 4, 36]. These methods leverage topological
relationships, aim to detect suspicious nodes and use that to grow
their seed dataset, use machine-learning, or are based on graph
regularization techniques. For an overview, we refer the reader to
the survey by Spirin and Han [27]. It is important to note that prior
work has mainly focused on detecting link spam, which typically
creates an abundance of interconnected links between websites.
Contrastingly, PBNs try to resemble regular websites and are careful
to only create links that appear legitimate. As such, web spam
and PBNs exhibit very different properties and thus the detection
methods are not directly interchangeable.
8 CONCLUSION
By ranking higher in search results, website owners can gain a
significant advantage over their competitors. Next to following the
standard guidelines to optimize a website for search engines, certain
website administrators may resort to deceptive SEO methods, for
instance by purchasing artificially created backlinks. Through an
exploratory experiment where we ordered several of these backlink
packages, and find that many of these backlinks are created through
so-called private blog networks. In this paper, we present a com-
prehensive and in-depth analysis of the different entities involved
in the PBN ecosystem.
We propose a novel methodology to detect PBN sites based on a
guided search to identify websites that are more likely to be involved
in a PBN, and a multi-step classifier that leverages both content-
based and linking-based features inherent to the PBN ecosystem.
Starting from a limited seed set of PBN sites, we perform a large-
scale experiment on 52,777 websites and manage to detect 3,552 PBN
sites. Our analysis of these PBN sites shows that backlink providers
employ a wide variety of measures to avoid detection, which is
highly indicative of the ongoing arms race between search engines
and PBN owners. We conjecture that improving the mechanisms
used to detect PBNs, e.g. through our proposed methodology, can
drive up the operational costs of these services and thus reduce
the financial motives to operate PBNs. Finally, despite the various
measures taken by backlink providers to prevent all websites from
their network to be associated, we find that several techniques
are still effective at detecting clusters. Leveraging these methods,
we find that a single PBN network may consist of several hundred
websites that link to thousands of customers, allowing the operators
to generate a revenue of more than $100,000 per month.
