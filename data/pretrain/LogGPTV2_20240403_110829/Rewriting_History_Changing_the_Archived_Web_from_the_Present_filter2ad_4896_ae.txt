### Table 2: Third-Party Domains Capable of Attacking the Most Snapshot Domains

This table lists third-party domains that could potentially launch attacks on the most snapshot domains we studied. It is important to note that we do not suggest that any of these domains have or would deploy such attacks. The vulnerabilities often arise from the complex nature of modern web practices, which can inadvertently lead to these issues.

We emphasize that the continuous vulnerability of a website may be valuable to attackers who need to modify the appearance of a particular snapshot for their goals. If a significant fraction of the snapshots of a website are vulnerable over time, the likelihood of an attacker exploiting specific snapshots increases.

### Vulnerabilities in Homepages and Subpages

In addition to the measurements described in this section, which focused on homepages, we also conducted a smaller study on subpages (pages linked from the homepages) to determine if vulnerabilities extend beyond the front page. For this, we configured TrackingExcavator to visit up to five links on each homepage in the archived 2016 top 500, selecting only links that led to snapshots of the same domain. If a homepage had no within-domain links or if we were unable to follow those links, it was excluded from the analysis.

**Key Findings:**
- **236/500 domains:** We were able to follow at least one link that remained within the domain but led to a different page.
- **81% (192/236) of these domains:** Contained an archive-escape vulnerability on either a homepage or a subpage, consistent with our larger results across the entire top 500.
- **52% (124/236):** Had vulnerabilities on both the homepage and at least one subpage.
- **6% (15/236):** Had vulnerabilities only on the homepage.
- **22% (53/236):** Had vulnerabilities only on subpages.

**Implications:**
1. **Undercounting Total Vulnerability:** The frequent appearance of vulnerabilities on subpages but not on homepages suggests that our main numbers may undercount the total vulnerability of the archived web, as they are derived from measurements of archived homepages.
2. **Structural Elements:** The frequency with which vulnerabilities appear on both homepages and subpages of the same domain supports our hypothesis that these vulnerabilities are often created by structural elements used across multiple pages and persist over time.

### Potential Attackers and Their Capabilities

**Some Potential Attackers Have the Ability to Compromise Many Domains’ Snapshots:**

- **Total Attackers:** There are 2,077 potential attackers for Attacks #1 and #4 over the 2,692 sites in our Top 500 dataset (3,298 attackers over 7,000 sites in the Top Million).
- **Limited Targets:** Over half of the attackers in the Top 500 can only attack a single, particular snapshot domain (40% in the Top Million).
- **Widespread Opportunities:** Some attackers have more widespread opportunities. Table 2 shows the individual third-party domains capable of launching Attacks #1 or #4 against the most snapshot domains. These domains often include advertising and analytics networks, social network widgets, and content distribution services.

**First vs. Third-Party Attackers:**

- **Same-Origin Escape Attacks (#2 and #3):** Can only be executed by a third-party domain.
- **Archive-Escape Abuse and Anachronism Injection Attacks (#1 and #4):** Can be performed by both first- and third-parties.
- **First-Party Attackers:** Usually the original publishers of the information, changing content they published.
- **Third-Party Attackers:** Generally change content originally created and published by the first-party.
- **Trend:** Over time, third-party attackers have become much more common for archive-escape vulnerabilities, with nearly every (97%) recent snapshot having at least one third-party destination, up from 60% since 2007-timestamp snapshots.

**Unowned Attack Domains:**

- **Unowned Domains:** We found 23 archive-escape destination domains and 60 never-archived resource domains that were unowned as of Spring 2017. These domains can be purchased by anyone to launch an attack on vulnerable sites. This is how we performed our proof-of-concept attack (Figure 1).

### Measurements of URLs Used in Court Proceedings

**Dataset Analysis:**

- **Dataset:** Consists of 840 URLs from 991 legal documents.
- **Critical Accuracy:** The accuracy of these archived pages is critical, as the motivation exists for a potential attacker to manipulate one of these snapshots to influence legal proceedings.
- **Vulnerability Prevalence:** 57 were vulnerable to Attack #1, and 37 of those were complete-control vulnerabilities. None contained never-archived resources, unlike the broader archive, which commonly contains such vulnerabilities. This suggests that URLs cited in legal proceedings may be of higher quality due to expert curation.

**Potential Impact:**

- **Exploitation:** If these vulnerabilities had been exploited during legal cases, they could have given an attacker the ability to hide or plant evidence. We stress that there is no reason to believe any of these vulnerabilities were exploited, but future use of archived URLs in legal matters must be treated with caution.

### Defenses

**Overview:**

- **Defensive Goal:** To allow users of archives to have more confidence in their understanding of the web of the past.
- **Deployment Categories:** Website publishers, archives, or clients, and categorized by when they can be deployed (retrospectively or after the time-of-attack).

**Table 3: Summary of Defenses**

| Defense | Prevent | Detect | Who Deploys? | When? |
|---------|---------|--------|--------------|-------|
| Opt-Out of Archives | ✓ | - | Website Owner | Any Time |
| Avoid Dynamically Generated URLs | ✓ | - | Website Owner | Time-of-Publication |
| Actively Archive Subresources | ✓ | - | Website Owner | Time-of-Archive |
| Modify Archived Javascript to Avoid Escapes | ✓ | - | Archive | Any Time |
| Serve Distinct Archived Domains from Distinct Subdomains | ✓ | - | Archive | Any Time |
| Escape-/Anachronism-Blocking Browser Extension | - | ✓ | End-user | Time-of-Access |
| Escape-/Anachronism-Highlighting Browser Extension | - | ✓ | End-user | Time-of-Access |

**Detailed Defenses:**

**Website Publishers:**

1. **Opt-Out of Archives:**
   - **Description:** Websites can opt-out of being preserved in the Wayback Machine, avoiding archival vulnerabilities.
   - **Downsides:** Eliminates the social and cultural benefits of the archive, and some sites may not be legally permitted to opt-out. Additionally, the Wayback Machine is giving less weight to robots.txt files, making this defense less viable.

2. **Avoid Dynamically Generated URLs:**
   - **Description:** Design websites to use fewer dynamically generated URLs to reduce archive-escapes.
   - **Weaknesses:** Dynamic behavior and URLs are valuable features of the modern web, and this defense cannot protect against third-party content.

3. **Actively Archive Subresources:**
   - **Description:** Preemptively replace missing subresources with benign resources to plug vulnerabilities.
   - **Limitations:** Only the potential attacker can publish a benign resource, and this defense is ineffective if the first-party wants to launch an attack.

**Web Archives:**

1. **Use Content Security Policy Headers to Block Escapes:**
   - **Description:** Add CSP headers to responses when serving archived content to block the use of third-party resources.
   - **Implementation:** After disclosing our findings, Internet Archive modified the Wayback Machine to deploy CSP headers.

**End-Users:**

1. **Escape-/Anachronism-Blocking Browser Extension:**
   - **Description:** A browser extension that detects and blocks archive-escapes and anachronisms.
   - **Usage:** Deployed at the time of access.

2. **Escape-/Anachronism-Highlighting Browser Extension:**
   - **Description:** A browser extension that highlights potential archive-escapes and anachronisms.
   - **Usage:** Deployed at the time of access.
