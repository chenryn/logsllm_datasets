## Steps to Reproduce
Run this:
    import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
    void main() => runApp(MyApp());
    class MyApp extends StatefulWidget {
      @override
      _MyAppState createState() => _MyAppState();
    }
    class _MyAppState extends State {
      @override
      Widget build(BuildContext context) {
        return MaterialApp(
          home: Scaffold(
            body: Center(
              child: Container(
                width: 200,
                height: 200,
                decoration: BoxDecoration(
                  color: Colors.blue,
                  border: Border.all(
                    color: Colors.white,
                  ),
                ),
              ),
            ),
          ),
        );
      }
    }
I'd expect to see a blue box with a simple white border, but there is actually
a very slight blue line outside of the white border. I haven't seen it in
previous versions of flutter, but then again I haven't looked for it
specifically. I'd guess this is something to do with anti-aliasing in the
engine.
This is what it looks like in a screenshot (and FYI I've tested in release
mode and it does the same thing, not that I'd really expect it to be
different).

And blown up:
