## Steps to Reproduce

1. Run the following Flutter code:

    ```dart
    import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

    void main() => runApp(MyApp());

    class MyApp extends StatefulWidget {
      @override
      _MyAppState createState() => _MyAppState();
    }

    class _MyAppState extends State<MyApp> {
      @override
      Widget build(BuildContext context) {
        return MaterialApp(
          home: Scaffold(
            body: Center(
              child: Container(
                width: 200,
                height: 200,
                decoration: BoxDecoration(
                  color: Colors.blue,
                  border: Border.all(
                    color: Colors.white,
                  ),
                ),
              ),
            ),
          ),
        );
      }
    }
    ```

2. I expected to see a blue box with a simple white border. However, there is a very slight blue line outside of the white border.

3. This issue was not observed in previous versions of Flutter, though I did not specifically look for it. I suspect this might be related to anti-aliasing in the rendering engine.

4. The issue persists in release mode as well.
