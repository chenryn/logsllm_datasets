of the position of A and B.
The coordinates are expressed as spherical coordinates
with latitude (lat) and longitude (lon): CA = (latA, lonA)
and CB = (latB, lonB).
DHS(CA, CB) <  ⇔
α2·β2−2αγ·βδ +γ2·δ2 +ζθ2·ηλ2−2ζθµ·ηλν +ζµ2·ην2 < a,
with a as deﬁned above and
α = cos(latA/2)
γ = sin(latA/2)
ζ = cos(latA)
θ = sin(lonA/2)
µ = cos(lonA/2)
β = sin(latB/2)
δ = cos(latB/2)
η = cos(latB)
λ = cos(lonB/2)
ν = sin(lonB/2).
Underlined terms are inputs of party A while all other
terms are inputs of party B. Computing this formula requires
6 FPMULT, 5 FPADD, and 1 FPCMP operations.
Performance. We implemented the three proximity test-
ing algorithms from [ˇSG14] using our ﬂoating-point building
blocks. In Tab. 5 we compare the runtime of the original
implementation of [ˇSG14] that uses homomorphic encryp-
tion (HE) and Yao’s Garbled Circuits (GC) with our imple-
mentation based on GMW and Yao for single and parallel
evaluation. We are able to achieve better runtimes for single
executions of the protocol (by factor 6.2 for HS and more
than factor 14 for UTM and ECEF), and more than two
orders of magnitude speedup for highly parallel execution.
Thereby, we show that our approach allows to substantially
improve upon the runtime of hand-crafted protocols while at
the same time it beneﬁts from the heavily tested and veri-
ﬁed circuit building blocks from industrial-grade hardware
synthesis libraries.

linearly with the level of parallelism. The setup times of Yao
and GMW are similar for all parameters.
Our improved performance stems from both, the optimized
circuits generated by the state-of-the-art hardware synthesis
tools which we manipulate to optimize the circuits for either
depth or size, and from the eﬃcient implementation of GMW
and Yao’s garbled circuits with most recent optimizations
in ABY. Since both protocols are based on Boolean circuits,
we improve the performance of operations that require many
bit operations. Operations that involve many integer multi-
plications are better suited for solutions based on arithmetic-
or secret-sharing.
6. APPLICATION: PRIVACY-PRESERVING
PROXIMITY TESTING ON EARTH
As application for secure computation on ﬂoating-point op-
erations, we consider privacy-preserving proximity testing on
Earth [ˇSG14]. Here, the goal is to compute if two coordinates
CA and CB input by party A and B respectively are within
a given distance : D(CA, CB) < . This is a useful but
rather privacy-critical use case that has many applications,
such as ﬁnding nearby friends, points of interest or targeted
advertising, and is widely used with the recent spread of
end-user GPS receivers and geo location via IP addresses.
The authors of [ˇSG14] present and compare three diﬀerent
distance metrics: UTM, ECEF, and HS described below. In
their paper, the authors design secure protocols based on
additively homomorphic encryption (HE) or Yao’s garbled
circuits (GC) that require to quantize all values to integers,
which means a loss of precision.
