TABLE IV.
HTTP SCAN RESULTS.
and VxVault only know one of the servers each, an abysmal
1.1%. Overall, CyberProbe ﬁnds 4 times more malicious
servers than the best of these services. The best coverage
among those 4 services is achieved by those using automatic
processing (VirusTotal and URLQuery). Although those 2
services have huge URL and malware collections, they still
achieve limited coverage. Those services could be combined
with our active probing approach so that when they discover
new seed servers and families, ﬁngerprints are automatically
generated and scanned to identify other family servers. This
would signiﬁcantly increase their coverage and bring them
closer to Internet scale.
Our results show that CyberProbe achieves 4 times bet-
ter coverage than current approaches for identifying some
malicious server families. However, there exist some imple-
mentation and deployment trade-offs that limit CyberProbe’s
coverage, which could be even higher. For example, we reuse
the results of horizontal scans over time to minimize the
number of horizontal scans. In particular, scans 12–21 target
the live hosts found by horizontal scan 12 in Table III. As
expected, the response rate of these HTTP scans decreases
over time as those results become stale. However, we ﬁnd that
the response rate decreases slowly, from 75% to 70% 3 weeks
later. Scans 19–20 show a lower response rate because they
include 2 instances that (unaware to us) were rate-limited by
the provider. Removing the instances from that provider the
response rate was 70% for scans 19–20. This slow decrease
justiﬁes the trade-off of coverage for politeness. However, in
other situations it may be possible or better to perform more
aggressive scanning. We further discuss scan completeness in
Section VI.
False positives. The majority of the ﬁngerprints do not produce
false positives. However,
the bh2-adobe ﬁngerprint, which
captures a fake Adobe webpage (further explained in the next
section) produces one false positive. It corresponds to a web
server with a page that contains license keys for popular
software from Adobe. The authors seem to have copied parts
of the Adobe webpage that are part of our signature. We have
not veriﬁed if the license keys work.
E. UDP scans.
One of the ﬁngerprints produced by CyberProbe was for
the UDP-based P2P protocol used by the ZeroAccess botnet.
According to an analysis by Sophos [62], this P2P protocol
has two types of peers: remotely reachable supernodes with
public IP addresses and normal nodes behind NATs. There
are two distinct ZeroAccess botnets, each using two ports
for the P2P C&C (for 32-bit and 64-bit
infected hosts).
The executed malware was from one of the 32-bit botnets
operating on port 16471/udp. The ﬁngerprint captures a getL
command in which a peer requests from a supernode the list of
other supernodes it knows about, and the corresponding retL
response where the supernode returns a subset of its peers.
Table V summarizes the UDP scans. A localized-restricted
scan on 40,488 IPs belonging to a residential US provider was
ﬁrst used to test the ﬁngerprint. It identiﬁed 55 supernodes,
a response rate of 0.13%. A later Internet-wide scan found
7,884 supernodes (0.0003% response rate). Since the response
comprises a list of advertised supernodes, we extract their
addresses from the responses and compute their union across
all 7,884 responses. There were 15,943 supernodes advertised
at the time of the Internet-wide scan. Of those, 6,257 (39%)
were found by our scan and 9,686 (61%) were not reachable.
The unreachable hosts could have been cleaned, be ofﬂine, or
have changed IP address (e.g., mobile devices, DHCP). Our
scan also ﬁnds 1,627 supernodes alive but not advertised. This
could be due to supernodes only responding with a partial
list of peers and due to nodes that have changed IP since
advertised. One day after the Internet-wide scan only 19%

does not show any domain associated on different passive DNS
databases, so we believe it is kept as backup in case the main
one is taken ofﬂine.
Blackhole2-adobe. The bh2-adobe ﬁngerprint captures a mal-
ware distribution operation through drive-by downloads that
has been ongoing since at least October 2012 [6]. This oper-
ation conﬁgures their Blackhole 2 exploit servers to redirect
users to a fake Adobe webpage if exploitation fails, which
prompts the user to install a malicious Flash player update.
The webpage has been copied from Adobe but resides on
a different resource. Our ﬁngerprint captures that an Adobe
server will reply to that resource with a 404 error, but the
exploit servers will successfully return an Adobe download
page. Our Internet-wide scan on July 6 found 10 live servers,
all
in cloud hosting services. This supports recent results
that the majority of exploit servers are abusing cloud hosting
services [36]. Of the 10 servers, 3 were already known to
VirusTotal. Another 2 were identiﬁed by VirusTotal four days
later, and a third one 13 days after CyberProbe detected it.
This shows how CyberProbe can ﬁnd servers earlier than other
approaches.
Blackhole2-ngen. The bh2-ngen ﬁngerprint captures another
drive-by download operation, distinguishable because their
URLs contain the /ngen/ directory. The Internet-wide scan
reveals only 2 servers. To verify that CyberProbe does not miss
servers we examine the URLQuery database. It contains 10
exploit servers with the /ngen/ string since October 2012. Since
then, the database contains at most three servers operating on
the same period of time. None of those 10 servers are located
in known hosting providers, which makes us think they are
using their own hosting. The new server CyberProbe found on
July 7 is still not in URLQuery. It is the only server hosted on
a known dedicated server hosting provider. We hypothesize it
is either a test server or has not yet been set to receive trafﬁc.
Doubleighty. The doubleighty family uses an unknown ex-
ploit server with a ﬁxed resource in the landing URL:
/forum/links/column.php. CyberProbe identiﬁes 18
distinct servers in 3 localized scans with strong provider
locality as two cloud hosting providers host 61% of the servers.
After the March 3 scan, we used a honeyclient to visit the 9
new servers found. Seven of them exploited the honeyclient
but two did not. We set the honeyclient to periodically visit
those 2 servers. One month later (April 4) one of them started
distributing malware. This shows that the server was installed
much earlier than it started being used. It also shows that active
probing can sometimes identify stand-by servers, before they
exhibit their malicious behavior.
Kovter. Kovter is a ransomware family that blocks the infected
computer and displays a police warning on the screen telling
the user it needs to pay a ﬁne to have it unlocked. CyberProbe
produced two ﬁngerprints for different C&C messages used
by the malware. We performed one localized scan using the
kovter-links ﬁngerprint that found 2 servers and an Internet-

SERVER OPERATIONS SUMMARY.
of the 15,943 advertised supernodes were alive. This high
variability has previously been observed to make it easy to
overestimate the size of a botnet using IP addresses [52].
However, the speed of active probing makes IP variability a
smaller issue, enabling an easy and quite accurate method for
estimating the size of P2P botnets.
F. Server Operations
Table VI summarizes the 10 server operations analyzed.
It shows the number of ﬁngerprints from the operation used
in the scans, the seeds used to generate the ﬁngerprints, the
number of unique servers found, the number of providers
hosting the servers found, and the ratio of servers per provider
of the operation. Overall, these operations host an average of
3.2 servers per provider. The remainder of this section details
selected operations.
BestAV. Best AV is an afﬁliate pay-per-install program that
has been operating since at least August 2010 distributing
the winwebsec family, which encompasses multiple fake
AV brands [4]. Nowadays, BestAV manages 3 programs:
the winwebsec fake antivirus, the Urausy ransomware, and
another unknown family [5]. We have 3 ﬁngerprints related to
the BestAV operation. Two of the ﬁngerprints were generated
by running winwebsec malware. They capture C&C servers
(winwebsec) and payment servers (bestav-pay). The Internet-
wide scans reveal 16 payment servers and 11 C&C servers.
There is strong provider locality as they use 4 cloud hosting
providers for the 27 servers. Provider A hosts 6 payment and
5 C&C servers, provider B 9 payment and 4 C&C servers,
provider C 2 C&C servers, and provider D the remaining
payment server. The 3 providers used for payment servers
provide only dedicated server hosting, which indicates that
the managers do not want external services colocated with
their payment infrastructure. The third ﬁngerprint captures web
servers used by the afﬁliates for checking statistics and col-
lecting their installers. We manually generated this ﬁngerprint
after reading an external analysis, which identiﬁed 2 live web
servers [4]. One of them was alive and we use it as seed server.
An Internet-wide scan reveals a second server for the afﬁliates
that we have not seen mentioned anywhere else. This server
11
wide scan 3 months later using the newer kovter-pixel ﬁnger-
print that found 7. Thus, the C&C infrastructure has a high
level of redundancy. One of the servers appears in both scans
so it has been alive for at least 3 months. It is located in a
German cloud hosting provider. Overall, the 8 distinct servers
are distributed among 4 cloud hosting providers.
Clickpayz Clickpayz1 is an online service that sells clicks.
Quoting them: “clickPAYZ has a network of search sites with
10s of millions of people searching for everything under the
sun”. Some ﬁles in our malware datasets send clicks to their
servers and the two ﬁngerprints produced by CyberProbe seem
to correspond to trafﬁc sent by two different afﬁliates. The
39 unique servers identiﬁed by both ﬁngerprints are click
redirectors belonging to Clickpayz. They are located on 6 cloud
hosting providers. Clickpayz managers are either unaware that
their afﬁliates send them clicks via ﬁles ﬂagged as malicious
by different antivirus, or simply do not care. However, their
claim of having tens of millions of people searching their sites
is dubious and their site only provides an email address as
contact information, typically a sign of dark objectives.
A. Ethical Considerations
VI. DISCUSSION
Internet scanning has been carried out many times for
different research goals [11], [14], [20], [28], [41]. Still, the
unsolicited nature of the probes makes some targets consider it
offensive. We take ethical considerations seriously in our study.
For our horizontal scanning, we follow the recommendations
of prior work, notably those by Leonard and Loguinov [28]
who study how to perform maximally polite horizontal scans.
We adopt their proposals of mixing the scanner IP addresses,
setting up forward and backward DNS records for the scanners,
running a web server on the scanners with a page explaining
that the probing is part of a research project, and removing
from the scan whitelist the ranges of owners that complain
about our probing and are willing to share their IP ranges.
