When i started using freecodecamp, i didn't know that each user can create a
personal profile and all his solutions will be present there.  
As a result, my profile page is filled with many redundant solutions because
sometimes i comeback and relearn old problems and submit the results many
times.
It would be nice if there is a button that allows user to delete unwanted or
dated solutions.  
Thanks.
