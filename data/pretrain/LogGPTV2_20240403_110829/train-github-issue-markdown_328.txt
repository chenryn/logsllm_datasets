When I first started using freeCodeCamp, I was unaware that each user could create a personal profile where all of their solutions would be stored. As a result, my profile page has become cluttered with many redundant solutions. This is because I sometimes revisit and relearn old problems, submitting multiple solutions over time.

It would be very helpful if there were an option to delete unwanted or outdated solutions. 

Thank you.
