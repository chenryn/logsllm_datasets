User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Wildcards in Virtual Hosts with dynamic logs? My Apache Virtual Hosts config currently has several repeats of this;

&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;
    ServerName example1.com
    ServerAlias www.example1.com

    DocumentRoot /home/example1.com/www

    LogLevel warn
    ErrorLog /home/example1.com/logs/error.log
    CustomLog /home/example1.com/logs/access.log combined

    Alias /dev /home/example1.com/dev
    ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /home/example1.com/cgi-bin
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;


How would one go about changing that so all the 'example1.com' instances are replaced with whatever domain the user is currently viewing?

I know of mod_vhost_alias, but I don't see any mention of it being able to do logs or alias (aside from ScriptAlias) dynamically as well. Is there some way to accomplish that? I'd rather not sacrifice separate logs for this.

Assistant: You could probably solve the alias with a mod_rewrite rule:

# get the server name from the Host: header
UseCanonicalName Off

# remove www.
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^www\.(.*)$ 
RewriteRule .? - [E=noWWWHost:%1]

# map /dev  to the documentroot for dev
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/~
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^www\. 
RewriteRule ^/dev/(.*)$ /home/${lowercase:%{ENV:noWWWHost}}/dev/$1


# not using www
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/~
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} !^www\. 
RewriteRule ^/dev/(.*)$ /home/${lowercase:%{HTTP_HOST}}/dev/$1


# make a log that is "splitable" on host
LogFormat "%{Host}i %h %l %u %t \"%r\" %s %b" vcommon
CustomLog logs/access_log vcommon


Edit: Forgot to add that the config above is untested :)
