Get the logs of the containers in the Pod: `kubectl logs <pod-name>` This will return the logs of the first container in the Pod. If there are multiple containers in the Pod, the container name should be specified: `kubectl logs <pod-name> -c <container-name>` 4. View recent log output: `kubectl logs -f <pod-name>` use This command can view the log output of the containers in the Pod in real time. In addition, you can also use the Kubernetes Dashboard graphical interface to monitor the status of pods, view logs, and visually present the running status of pods to help O&M personnel quickly locate problems.
