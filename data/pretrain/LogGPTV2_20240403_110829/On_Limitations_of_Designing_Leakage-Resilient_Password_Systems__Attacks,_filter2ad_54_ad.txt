original papers [20, 31, 32, 4].
For memory demand, the cost for each scheme is a ra-
tio k/λop between the number of secret items, k, and the
accuracy rate of corresponding memory retrieval operation
within a ﬁxed memorization time, λop. Since recognition
is much easier than recall [14, 25, 29, 23, 10], it is neces-
sary to distinguish the difﬁculty for different memory re-
trieval operations. According to [14], λop is 29.6% for re-
call and 84.8% for recognition. A better estimation for the
memory demand could be the minimum time for the sub-
ject to remember all the secrets. However, the lower bound
of memorization time is difﬁcult to measure in experimen-
tal psychology, as the subject may not realize the precise
time point when he just remembers all the secrets. An un-
conﬁdent subject may take more time to rehearsal than that
actually required. Other memory factors, like password in-
terference and recall accuracy over extended periods, may
also be considered but are not integrated in our current anal-
ysis framework.
Finally, an overall score, HP (standing for Human
Power), is calculated as the product of cognitive workload
score HP(C) and memory demand score HP(M). This score
(HP) indicates the expected human capability requirement
for a human-computer authentication system.
6.2 High Security at Cost of Heavy Cognitive De(cid:173)
mand
Table 1 shows the security strength and HP for the repre-
sentative LRPS systems based on our quantitative analysis
framework. Those systems are listed in the descend order of
their HP. All the schemes use their default parameter values
except that the round number is adjusted to make the suc-
cessful rate of random guessing to reach the same level (i.e.
the authentication strength of 6-digit PIN). This adjustment
is necessary to make a fair comparison as they now have the
same strength to defend against an adversary without prior
knowledge. The other two points in this table which need
explanation are about PAS [4] and CHC [32]. In PAS, we
consider the root secret for each authentication session as
the predicates instead of the complete secret pairs, due to
that the same predicates are used for all the rounds in an
authentication. The predicates are the actual root secret of
each authentication session. In CHC, the expected success-
ful rate of guessing attack is not reported in the original pa-
per. We estimate it based on Statement 2, which is 21.78%
derived from our simulation results. The detailed computa-
tion of the cognitive workload for those schemes is given in
Table 2 of Appendix A.
The column “HP(C)/round” in this table shows the cog-
nitive workload required to solve the challenge in each au-
thentication round. It shows the average thinking time. All
of them except LPN [15] and APW [2] are very close to
the average time cost reported in the original literatures
[20, 31, 32, 4]. For LPN, there is no report on a controlled
user study. The scheme is implemented as a public web
page, to which the subjects can freely access and get a re-
ward for each successful login. There is no evidence show-
ing that the subjects were asked to memorize their root se-
cret (which are 15 secret positions), and then recall them
in each authentication round. Thus, the average time cost
reported for each round is very likely to be underestimated,
as the recall operations are probably replaced by directly
reading their written-down secrets. For APW, its time cost
is directly estimated based on the results of LPN (with no
actual user study conducted), which implies it could also be
underestimated.
This table shows three tiers in these representative
schemes. From bottom to top, the schemes in an upper
tier have better security against secret leakage at the cost
of lower usability. The schemes at the bottom are PAS [4]
and CHC [32], which are susceptible to both brute force and
statistical attacks. When moving to the middle tier (consist-
ing of CAS [31] and SecHCI [20]), the memory demand
increases to make brute force attack infeasible. However,
they are still susceptible to statistical attack as the simple
challenge used in these schemes is not sufﬁcient to hide the
statistical signiﬁcance of the secret. More cognitive work-
load is required to mix the secret items with the other items.
The top tier consists of LPN [15] and APW [2], which fol-
low all of our design principles. They are immune to both
brute force and statistical attacks in practical settings, but
impose signiﬁcantly high usability cost.
There is an interesting ﬁnding when looking at the two
schemes in the top tier. In our quantitative analysis frame-
work, LPN has a higher HP score but a smaller password
space compared to APW. This is because our security mea-
surement is limited to brute force and two generic statistical
attacks. It is still possible to ﬁnd out other more efﬁcient
attacks that lower the security strength of APW. The trade-
off relation under our quantitative analysis framework may
not strictly follow the order of HP, as it is always feasible
to design a scheme with a lower usability for a given secu-
rity strength. But it is required that the human capability
should reach a lower bound so as to achieve a high security
strength.
The above results provide quantitative evidence for the
inherent limitations in the design of LRPS. They indicate
the incompetence of human cognitive capabilities in using
secure LRPS systems without a secure channel in practical
settings. This may also explain why the problem is still
open since its ﬁrst proposal [22] twenty years ago.
7 Related Work
As one of the most important security tools of modern
society, the design problem of a secure and usable pass-
word system has been extensively investigated. We sum-
marize the closely related research work from the following
aspects: attacks, principles, and tradeoff analysis for LRPS
systems.
Most of proposed LRPSes have been broken. The re-
cent works on representative attack and analysis include:
Golle and Wagner proposed the SAT attack [13] against
the CAS schemes [31]; Li et al. demonstrated the brute-
force attack [18] against the PAS scheme [4]; they later pre-
sented a Gaussian elimination-based algebraic attack [19]
against the virtual password system [17]; Asghar et al. in-
troduced a statistical attack [1] against the CHC scheme
[32]; Dunphy et al. analyzed a replay-based shoulder surf-
ing attack for recognition-based graphical password sys-
tems under a weaker threat model [11]. Compared to them,
our paper provides security analysis in a more generic set-
ting, which presents two types of generic attacks that can be
used to analyze any LRPS systems. Furthermore, we intro-
duce a new statistical attack, probabilistic decision tree, and
a generalized version of existing statistical attacks, multi-
dimensional counting. We analyze and re-examine the ex-
isting LRPS systems with these new attack tools. Thereby,
we discover the vulnerabilities of Undercover [27] and
SecHCI [20] that have not been reported before. We no-
tice that a recent work by Perkovic et al. [24] also identiﬁed
the design ﬂaw of Undercover independently.
Some other design principles have been proposed for
LRPS systems. Roth et al. [26] proposed the basic princi-
ple of using cognitive trapdoor game, where the knowledge
of secret should not be directly revealed during password
entry. Li and Shum [20] later suggested another three prin-
ciples that require time-variant responses, randomness in
challenges and responses, and indistinguishability against
the statistical analysis. Our principles further extend the
coverage by including the defense principles against brute
force attack, and provide more concrete guidelines against
two generic statistical attacks introduced in our paper.
Until now it is still a challenge to provide a quantita-
tive tradeoff analysis among multiple LRPS systems [5].
As pointed out by Biddle et al. [5], the usability evalua-
tion in prior research lacks consistency, which makes it is
difﬁcult to compare those results. Our quantitative analysis
framework is the ﬁrst attempt to provide a uniform usability
measurement based on experimental psychology. Based on
this framework and our security analysis, we discover that
the tradeoff between security and usability is strong, which
indicates the inherent limitation in the design of LRPS sys-
tems. This limitation was ﬁrst addressed by Hopper and
Blum [15], where they hoped the future research could ﬁnd
out practical solutions for unaided humans that satisfy both
security and usability requirements. Unfortunately, from
our results, such solution may not exist. Coskun and Her-
ley [8] also reached a similar conclusion by analyzing the
efﬁciency of brute force attack with regards to response en-
tropy. Their conclusion is based on the assumption that a
user has to make a large number of sequential binary deci-
sions so as to increase response entropy. However, this as-
sumption may not be valid as humans have a strong parallel
processing capability when performing certain visual tasks
(e.g. visual search). Other prior research related to LRPS
systems can be found in a recent survey paper [5], which
summarized the development of new password systems in
the past decade.
We remark that our quantitative analysis framework is
still in its preliminary stage. We would like to point out two
limitations in our current work: 1) Since the cognitive work-
load is not totally independent with the memory demand, it
is possible to improve the overall score calculation instead
of using the product operation (i.e. HP= M×C); 2) Error
rate is currently not included in our analysis framework as it
is difﬁcult for experimental psychology to provide the gen-
eral relation between thinking time and error rate. Certain
approximation can be added to improve the precision of this
framework in the future.
8 Conclusion
In this paper, we provided a comprehensive analysis for
the inherent tradeoff between security and usability in de-
signing a leakage-resilient password system. We analyzed
the impacts of two types of generic attacks, brute force and
statistical attacks, on the existing schemes designed for un-
aided humans. Unlike the speciﬁc attacks proposed before
(such as SAT [13] and Gaussian elimination [19]), these
two generic attacks, as demonstrated in our paper, cannot
be mitigated without involving considerable demand on hu-
man capabilities. We introduced ﬁve principles that are nec-
essary to achieve leakage resilience when a secure channel
is unavailable. Usability costs for these principles are an-
alyzed. Our ﬁndings indicate that either high memory de-
mand or high cognitive workload is unavoidable in the de-
sign of secure LRPS for unaided humans. To further under-
stand the tradeoff between security and usability, we estab-
lished the ﬁrst quantitative analysis framework on usability
costs. Our result shows that there is a strong tradeoff be-
tween security and usability, indicating that an unaided hu-
man may not be competent enough to use a secure leakage-
resilient password system in practical settings.
