User: I'm trying to get new packages (request for example) and trying to do it through easy_install, but when I try to open it (both easy_install and easy_install-3.6) all I get is a blank terminal screen popping up for a second and than closing with nothing happening. What's wrong with it and how can I get new packages?
Assistant: easy_install must be used as a command in the command prompt and it cannot be opened as an application. Go to the folder where easy_install is and open command-prompt in that folder. Now perform installation of any libraries using:
>easy_install pandas #example
Or you can set this path in your environment variables and use it instead of using this path to install everytime.
