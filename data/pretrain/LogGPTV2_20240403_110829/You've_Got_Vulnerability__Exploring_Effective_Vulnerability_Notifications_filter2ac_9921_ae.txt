Security Policies
Body: Computer scientists at the University of Michi-
gan, the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, and
the University of California Berkeley have been con-
ducting Internet-wide scans to detect IPv4/IPv6 dual-
stack hosts that allow access to services via IPv6, but
not IPv4. This likely indicates a ﬁrewall misconﬁgura-
tion and could be a security vulnerability if the services
should not be publicly accessible. We have attached a list
of hosts that are potentially vulnerable on your network.

Body: During a recent study on the network security
policies of IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack hosts, computer scien-
tists at the University of Michigan, the University of Illi-
nois Urbana-Champaign, and the University of Califor-
nia Berkeley have been conducting Internet-wide scans
to detect IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack hosts that allow access to
services via IPv6, but not IPv4. This likely indicates a
ﬁrewall misconﬁguration and could be a security vulner-
ability if the services should not be publicly accessible.
We have attached a list of hosts that are potentially vul-
nerable on your network (as determined by WHOIS in-
formation).
For each dual-stack host, we test whether popular ser-
vices (e.g., SSH, Telnet, and NTP) are accessible via
IPv4 and/or IPv6 using a standard protocol handshake.
For ICMP this is an echo request, for TCP it is a SYN
segment, and for UDP this is an application-speciﬁc re-
quest (e.g., DNS A query for ‘www.google.com’ or an
NTP version query). We do not exploit any vulnerabili-
ties, attempt to login, or access any non-public informa-
tion.
The protocols we scanned are popular targets for attack
and/or can be used to launch DDoS attacks when left
publicly available to the Internet. We suspect they are
misconﬁgured and are notifying you because hosts rarely
offer services on IPv6 that are not offered on IPv4, and
we believe these services may have been left exposed ac-
cidentally. This is a common occurrence when admin-
istrators forget to conﬁgure IPv6 ﬁrewall policies along
with IPv4 policies.
If these IPv6-only accessible services should not be ac-
cessible to the public Internet, they can be restricted by
updating your ﬁrewall or by disabling or removing the
services. If none of your systems use IPv6, you can also
disable IPv6 on your system. Make sure your changes
are persistent and will not be undone by a system reboot.

Subject: [RAND#] Vulnerable SCADA Devices
Body: During a recent study on the public exposure
of industrial control systems, computer scientists at the
University of Michigan and the University of Califor-
nia Berkeley have been conducting Internet-wide scans
to detect publicly accessible industrial control (SCADA)
devices. These devices frequently have no built-in secu-
rity and their public exposure may place physical equip-
ment at risk for attack. We have attached a list of SCADA
devices on your network (as determined by WHOIS in-
formation) that are publicly accessible.
We scan for potentially vulnerable SCADA systems by
scanning the full IPv4 address space and attempting
protocol discovery handshakes (e.g., Modbus device ID
query). We do not exploit any vulnerabilities or change
any device state.
SCADA protocols including Modbus, S7, Bacnet, Trid-
ium Fox, and DNP3 allow remote control and moni-
toring of physical infrastructure and equipment over IP.
Unfortunately, these protocols lack critical security fea-
tures, such as basic authentication and encryption, or
have known security vulnerabilities. If left publicly ac-
cessible on the Internet, these protocols can be the tar-
get of attackers looking to monitor or damage physical
equipment, such as power control, process automation,
and HVAC control systems.
SCADA services are not designed to be publicly accessi-
ble on the Internet and should be maintained on an inter-
Subject: [RAND#] Vulnerable DDoS Ampliﬁers
Body: Computer scientists at George Mason University
and the University of California Berkeley have been de-
tecting open and misconﬁgured services that serve as
ampliﬁers for distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) at-
tacks. Attackers abuse these ampliﬁers to launch pow-
erful DDoS attacks while hiding the true attack source.

tack source. We have attached a list of hosts that are po-
tentially vulnerable on your network (as determined by
WHOIS information).
We detect ampliﬁers by monitoring hosts involved in re-
cent DDoS attacks and checking whether these hosts sup-
port the features used for launching an attack (e.g., NTP
monlist or recursive DNS resolution). We do not exploit
any vulnerabilities or attempt to access any non-public
data on these servers.
DDoS attacks are often conducted by directing an over-
whelming amount of network trafﬁc towards a target sys-
tem, making it unresponsive. Ampliﬁers are services that
send large amounts of data in response to small requests.
Attackers leverage these in DDoS attacks by spooﬁng
trafﬁc to the ampliﬁer, forging it to look as if it came
from the attacker’s target. Ampliﬁers then respond to
the target with a large response that overwhelms the tar-
get. Publicly accessible ampliﬁers are constantly abused
by attackers to conduct the DDoS attacks for them while
hiding the tracks of the real attacker.
These ampliﬁers can be avoided by disabling the appli-
cation or updating your ﬁrewall to block the application
port or restrict the IP addresses that can access it. More
speciﬁcally, Chargen should be closed as it is rarely use-
ful and is inherently an ampliﬁer.
If left open, DNS
should be conﬁgured to restrict who can make recursive
requests, and NTP should be conﬁgured to disable the
monlist functionality. Make sure your changes are per-
sistent and will not be undone by a system reboot.
