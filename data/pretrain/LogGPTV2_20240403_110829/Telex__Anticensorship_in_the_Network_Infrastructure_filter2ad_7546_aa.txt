Abstract
In this paper, we present Telex, a new approach to
resisting state-level Internet censorship. Rather than at-
tempting to win the cat-and-mouse game of ﬁnding open
proxies, we leverage censors’ unwillingness to completely
block day-to-day Internet access. In effect, Telex converts
innocuous, unblocked websites into proxies, without their
explicit collaboration. We envision that friendly ISPs
would deploy Telex stations on paths between censors’
networks and popular, uncensored Internet destinations.
Telex stations would monitor seemingly innocuous ﬂows
for a special “tag” and transparently divert them to a for-
bidden website or service instead. We propose a new
cryptographic scheme based on elliptic curves for tagging
TLS handshakes such that the tag is visible to a Telex
station but not to a censor. In addition, we use our tagging
scheme to build a protocol that allows clients to connect
to Telex stations while resisting both passive and active at-
tacks. We also present a proof-of-concept implementation
that demonstrates the feasibility of our system.

Introduction
The events of the Arab Spring have vividly demonstrated
the Internet’s power to catalyze social change through
the free exchange of ideas, news, and other information.
The Internet poses such an existential threat to repressive
regimes that some have completely disconnected from
the global network during periods of intense political un-
rest, and many regimes are pursuing aggressive programs
of Internet censorship using increasingly sophisticated
techniques.
Today, the most widely-used tools for circumventing
Internet censorship take the form of encrypted tunnels
and proxies, such as Dynaweb [12], Instasurf [30], and
Tor [10]. While these designs can be quite effective at
sneaking client connections past the censor, these systems
inevitably lead to a cat-and-mouse game in which the
censor attempts to discover and block the services’ IP
addresses. For example, Tor has recently observed the
blocking of entry nodes and directory servers in China
and Iran [28]. Though Tor is used to skirt Internet censors
in these countries, it was not originally designed for that
application. While it may certainly achieve its original
goal of anonymity for its users, it appears that Tor and
proxies like it are ultimately not enough to circumvent
aggressive censorship.
To overcome this problem, we proposeTelex: an “end-
to-middle” proxy with no IP address, located within the
network infrastructure. Clients invoke the proxy by using
public-key steganography to “tag” otherwise ordinary
TLS sessions destined for uncensored websites. Its design
is unique in several respects:
Architecture Previous designs have assumed that anti-
censorship services would be provided by hosts at the
edge of the network, as the end-to-end principle requires.
We propose instead to provide these services in the core
infrastructure of the Internet, along paths between the
censor’s network and popular, nonblocked destinations.
We argue that this will provide both lower latency and
increased resistance to blocking.
Deployment Many systems attempt to combat state-
level censorship using resources provided primarily by
volunteers. Instead, we investigate a government-scale
response based on the view that state-level censorship
needs to be combated by state-level anticensorship.
Construction We show how a technique that the security
and privacy literature most frequently associates with
government surveillance—deep-packet inspection—can
provide the foundation for a robust anticensorship system.
We expect that these design choices will be somewhat
controversial, and we hope that they will lead to discus-
sion about the future development of anticensorship sys-
tems.
Contributions and roadmap We propose using “end-
to-middle” proxies built into the Internet’s network in-
frastructure as a novel approach to resisting state-level
censorship. We elaborate on this concept and sketch the
design of our system in Section 2, and we discuss its
relation to previous work in Section 3.
We develop a new steganographic tagging scheme
based on elliptic curve cryptography, and we use it to
construct a modiﬁed version of the TLS protocol that
allows clients to connect to our proxy. We describe the
tagging scheme in Section 4 and the protocol in Section 5.
We analyze the protocol’s security in Section 6.
We present a proof-of-concept implementation of our
approach and protocols, and we support its feasibility
through laboratory experiments and real-world tests. We
describe our implementation in Section 7, and we evaluate
its performance in Section 8.

2 Concept
Telex operates as what we term an “end-to-middle” proxy.
Whereas in traditional end-to-end proxying the client con-
nects to a server that relays data to a speciﬁed host, in
end-to-middle proxying an intermediary along the path
to a server redirects part of the connection payload to
an alternative destination. One example of this mode of
operation is Tor’s leaky-pipe circuit topology [10] fea-
ture, which allows trafﬁc to exit from the middle of a
constructed Tor circuit rather than the end.
The Telex concept is to build end-to-middle proxying
capabilities into the Internet’s routing infrastructure. This
would let clients invoke proxying by establishing connec-
tions to normal, pre-existing servers. By applying this
idea to a widely used encrypted transport, such as TLS,
and carefully avoiding observable deviations from the
behavior of nonproxied connections, we can construct a
service that allows users to robustly bypass network-level
censorship without being detected.
In the remainder of this section, we deﬁne a threat
model and goals for the Telex system. We then give a
sketch of the design and discuss several practical consid-
erations.
2.1 Threat model
Our adversary, “the censor”, is a repressive state-level au-
thority that desires to inhibit online access to information
and communication of certain ideas. These desires are
realized by IP and DNS blacklists as well as heuristics for
blocking connections based on their observed content.
We note that the censor has some motivation for con-
necting to the Internet at all, such as the economic and
social beneﬁts of connectivity. Thus, the censor bears
some cost from over-blocking. We assume that the cen-
sor follows a blacklist approach rather than a whitelist
approach in blocking, allowing trafﬁc to pass through
unchanged unless it is explicitly banned.
Furthermore, we assume that the censor generally per-
mits widespread cryptographic protocols, such as TLS, ex-
cept when it has reason to believe a particular connection
is being used for skirting censorship. We further assume
that the censor is not subverting such protocols on a wide
scale, such as by requiring a cryptographic backdoor or
by issuing false TLS certiﬁcates using a country-wide CA.
We believe this is reasonable, as blocking or subverting
TLS on a wide scale would render most modern websites
unusably insecure. Subversion in particular would result
in an increased risk of large-scale fraud if the back door
were compromised or abused by corrupt insiders.
The censor controls the infrastructure of the network
within its jurisdiction (“the censor’s network”), and it
can potentially monitor, block, alter, and inject trafﬁc
anywhere within this region. However, these abilities
are subject to realistic technical, economic, and political
constraints.
In general, the censor does not control end hosts within
its network, which operate under the direction of their
users. We believe this assumption is reasonable based
on the failure of recent attempts by national governments
to mandate client-side ﬁltering software, such as China’s
Green Dam Youth Escort [33]. The censor might target
a small subset of users and seize control of their devices,
either through overt compulsion or covert technical at-
tacks. Protecting these users is beyond the scope of our
system. However, the censor’s targeting users on a wide
scale might have unacceptable political costs.
The censor has very limited abilities outside its network.
It does not control any external network infrastructure or
any popular external websites the client may use when
communicating with Telex stations. The censor can, of
course, buy or rent hosting outside its network, but its
use is largely subject to the policies of the provider and
jurisdiction.
Some governments may choose to deny their citizens
Internet connectivity altogether, or disconnect entirely
in times of crisis. These are outside our threat model;
the best approaches to censors like these likely involve
different approaches than ours, and entail much steeper
performance trade-offs. Instead, our goal is to make ac-
cess to any part of the global Internet sufﬁcient to access
every part of it. In other words, we aim to make connect-
ing to the global Internet an all-or-nothing proposition for
national governments.
Figure 1: Telex Concept — This ﬁgure shows an example user connecting to Telex. The client makes a tagged
connection to NotBlocked.com, which is passed by the censor’s ﬁlter. When the request reaches a friendly on-path
ISP, one of the ISP’s routers forwards the request to the Telex station connected to its tap interface. Telex deciphers
the tag, instructs the router to block the connection to NotBlocked.com. and diverts the connection to Blocked.com,
as the user secretly requested. If the connection were not tagged, Telex would not intervene, and it would proceed to
NotBlocked.com as normal.
2.2 Goals
Telex should satisfy the following properties:
Unblockable
The censor should not be able to deny
service to Telex without incurring unacceptable costs. In
particular, we require that the censor cannot block Telex
without blocking a large, primarily legitimate category of
Internet trafﬁc.
Conﬁdential
The censor should not be able to deter-
mine whether a user is using Telex or what content the
user is accessing through the system.
Easy to deploy
The consequences of system failure
(or even normal operation) must not interfere with normal
network operation (e.g., non-Telex connections) in order
for deployment to be palatable to ISPs.
Transparent to users Using Telex should, possibly
after a small startup procedure, closely resemble using an
unﬁltered Internet connection.
2.3 Design
To meet our goals and the constraints imposed by our
threat model, we propose the design shown in Figure 1.
As illustrated in the ﬁgure, a Telex connection proceeds
as follows:
1. The user’s client selects an appropriate website that
is not on the censor’s blacklist and unlikely to at-
tract attention, which we represent by the domain
NotBlocked.com.
2. The user connects to NotBlocked.com via HTTPS.
Her Telex client1 includes an invisible “tag,” which
looks like an expected random nonce to the censor,
but can be cryptographically veriﬁed by the Telex
station using its private key.
3. Somewhere along the route between the client and
NotBlocked.com, the connection traverses an ISP
that has agreed to attach a Telex station to one of its
routers. The connection is forwarded to the station
via a dedicated tap interface.
4. The station detects the tag and instructs the router to
block the connection from passing through it, while
still forwarding packets to the station through its
dedicated tap. (Unlike a deployment based on trans-
parent proxying, this conﬁguration fails open:
it
tolerates the failure of the entire Telex system and so
meets our goal of being easy to deploy.)
5. The Telex station diverts the ﬂow to Blocked.com as

perhaps by sneakernet, among mutually trusting individuals within the
censor’s domain.

packets from the client to Blocked.com and vice
versa until one side terminates the connection. If the
connection were untagged, it would pass through the
ISP’s router as normal.
comprehensive map of popular sites (where popularity is
as measured with data from other Telex users) such that a
Telex station is likely to be on the path between the user
and the site. Even with only partial deployment, users
would almost certainly discover a Telex station eventually.
We simpliﬁed the discussion above in an important
point: we need to specify what protocol is to be used over
the encrypted tunnel between the Telex client and the
Telex station and how the client communicates its choice
of Blocked.com. Layering IP atop the tunnel might seem
to be a natural choice, yielding a country-wide VPN of
sorts, but even a passive attacker may be able to differen-
tiate VPN trafﬁc patterns from those of a normal HTTPS
connection. As a result, we primarily envision using Telex
for protocols whose session behavior resembles that of
HTTPS. For example, an HTTP or SOCKS proxy would
be a useful application, or perhaps even a simple server
that presented a list of entry points for another anticen-
sorship system such as Tor [10]. In the remainder of this
paper, we assume that the application is an HTTP proxy.
The precise placement of Telex stations is a second
issue. Clearly, a chief objective of deployment is to cover
as many paths between the censor and popular Internet
destinations as possible so as to provide a large selection
of sites to play the role of NotBlocked.com. We might ac-
complish this either by surrounding the censor with Telex
stations or by placing them close to clusters of popular
uncensored destinations. In the latter case, care should
be taken not to reduce the size of the cluster such that the
censor would only need to block a small number of other-
wise desirable sites to render the station useless. Which
precise method of deployment would be most effective
and efﬁcient is, in part, a geopolitical question.
A problem faced by existing anticensorship systems
is providing sufﬁcient incentives for deployment [6].
Whereas systems that require cooperation of uncensored
websites create a risk that such sites might be blocked
by censors in retaliation, our system requires no such
participation. We envision that ISPs will willingly deploy
Telex stations for a number of reasons, including idealism,
goodwill, public relations, or ﬁnancial incentives (e.g.,
tax credits) provided by governments. At worst, the con-
