User: How to deploy a Django based web application using AWS EC2 instance?
Assistant: Deploying a Django-based web application on an AWS EC2 instance requires the following steps: 1. Create an AWS EC2 instance and connect to it. 2. Install the necessary software and dependencies such as Python, Django, and other required libraries. 3. Create a Django project. 4. Configure the database, such as PostgreSQL or MySQL. 5. Configure the web server, usually Apache or Nginx. 6. Configure the SSL certificate to enable the HTTPS security protocol. 7. Deploy the code and start the web server. 8. Test your application to make sure it works and displays correctly on a wide range of browsers. In this process, you need to learn how to operate the Linux command line, such as SSH, SCP and VM (Virtual Machine). You also need to know how to configure Django applications, such as how to add routes, how to query databases, how to write view functions, how to apply templates, etc. Detailed tutorials for the above steps can be found in the AWS official documentation. Armed with this knowledge, you can deploy any Django application on an AWS EC2 instance, whether it's a small blog, an online store, or an enterprise-level application.
