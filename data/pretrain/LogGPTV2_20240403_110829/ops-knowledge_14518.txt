Question: What are the potential consequences of an HMAC engine not implementing an iterative function to break up messages longer than 512 bits into fixed-size blocks?
"A": "It may lead to weaker encryption and increase the risk of security breaches.",
"B": "The HMAC engine's performance may improve due to processing smaller messages only.",
"C": "It could result in the HMAC engine being more resilient to timing attacks.",
"D": "The engine may be unable to process certain messages, limiting its real-world application."
