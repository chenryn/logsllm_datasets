User: I am currently trying to run Pydev with Pymongo on an Python3.3 Interpreter.
My problem is, I am not able to get it working :-/
First of all I installed Eclipse with Pydev.
Afterwards I tried installing pip to download my Pymongo-Module.
Problem is: it always installs pip for the default 2.7 Version.
I read that you shouldn't change the default system Interpreter (running on Lubuntu 13.04 32-Bit) so I tried to install a second Python3.3 and run it in an virtual environement, but I can't find any detailed Information on how to use everything on my specific problem.
Maybe there is someone out there, that uses a similar configuration and can help me out to get everything running (in a simple way) ?
Thanks in advance,
Eric
Assistant: You can install packages for a specific version of Python, all you need to do is specify the version of Python you want use from the command-line; e.g. Python2.7 or Python3.
Examples
Python3 pip your_package
Python3 easy_install your_package.
