### 6.4 Compromised Meter Classification

Figures 14(a) and 14(b) illustrate the performance in terms of steady-state trust values under additive and deductive falsification, where 50% of the meters are compromised for \(\delta_{av} = 900\) and \(\delta_{av} = 760\) in a small subset of 200 houses from the Texas dataset. It is evident that the trust values of compromised meters (marked in red with asterisks) are significantly lower than those of non-compromised smart meters (marked in blue with circles), allowing for linear separation through a threshold. This threshold is determined using a standard K-means unsupervised learning classifier.

Similarly, Figure 15(a) shows the steady-state trust distribution under camouflage attacks with \(\rho_{mal} = 50\%\), where additive and deductive meters are marked in green and red, respectively, and non-compromised meters are marked in blue. Figure 15(b) confirms the scalability of the results for 700 houses in the Texas dataset under an additive attack. The false alarm (FA) rate scales well, with 3% and 2.8% for 200 and 700 houses, respectively, given the same \(\delta_{av}\) as shown in Figures 14(a) and 15(b).

### 6.5 Time to Detection of Compromised Meters

A key advantage of our approach is its ability to quickly identify compromised meters compared to other classification-based methods [8, 9]. Figure 17(a) demonstrates the evolution of trust values after an attack is launched. For clarity, we plot the average trust of the compromised set and the average trust of the honest set over time. The figure shows that the average trust of the compromised set falls below the threshold within 10 days of the attack's start. Thus, steady state, as described in Figures 14(a) and 14(b), is achieved within 10 days on average, enabling the identification of rogue meters before significant damage occurs.

### 6.6 Classification against Isolated Attacks

Although our work primarily focuses on defending against orchestrated attacks involving a large number of compromised meters, it is also effective in identifying isolated malicious meters. In such isolated attacks, the ratio drop may not be significantly observable unless \(\delta_{av}\) is abnormally high. However, this is not necessary because such isolated attacks would not drastically affect the means and can be revealed through the discrete rating criterion and the proposed trust model. As evidence, the trust of two isolated meters launching additive and deductive attacks with \(\delta_{av} = 600\) (Figure 17(b)) is far lower than that of other honest meters. This demonstrates the validity of our approach in detecting isolated attacks, making our defense model sensitive to small-scale, low \(\rho_{mal}\) attacks.

### 6.7 Classification against Omission and Incremental Attacks

Figure 18(a) provides evidence that the proposed model can detect omission attacks, where 30% of the meters dropped data. Figure 18(b) shows the performance against incremental attacks, 45 days after the initial attack was launched. The amount of false data was incremented by 2W per meter every 4 hours.

### 6.8 Average Performance over \(\rho_{mal}\) and \(\delta_{av}\)

One benefit of our work is its robustness to higher fractions of compromised meters compared to most consensus-based methods, which fail when \(\rho_{mal}\) and/or \(\delta_{av}\) are high. Figures 19(a) and 19(b) show the average trust values of all compromised meters versus honest ones. Our technique fails at 75% of compromised meters for a 200-house Texas dataset, which is resilient. Similarly, Figure 20(a) shows the average trust difference among compromised and honest sets of meters over various \(\delta_{av}\) under additive attacks, when \(\rho_{mal} = 50\%\). Figure 20(b) shows the performance of our model when compromised meters alternate between true and false behavior periods based on pricing. Although the difference between trusts is less than in the earlier case, we can still classify the compromised meters.
