6.4 Compromised Meter Classi(cid:27)cation
Fig. 14(a) and Fig. 14(b), show the performance in terms of steady
state trust values, under additive and deductive falsi(cid:27)cation when
50% meters are compromised for δav❕ = 900 and δav❕ = 760 for a
small subset of 200 houses from Texas dataset. It is clear that com-
promised meter’s trust values, marked in red (asterisk) are signif-
icantly less than non-compromised smart meters marked in blue
(circles), such that they are linearly separable through a thresh-
old. The threshold is obtained through a standard K-means unsu-
pervised learning classi(cid:27)er. Similarly, Fig. 15(a) shows the steady
state trust distribution under camou(cid:30)age attacks with ρmal = 50%,
where additive and deductive meters are marked in green and red
while non-compromised are marked in blue. Fig. 15(b) con(cid:27)rms
the scalability results for 700 houses in Texas dataset under an ad-
ditive attack. Note that, the false alarm (FA) rate scale well with 3%
and 2.8% for 200 and 700 houses given same δav❕ as evident from
Fig 14(a) and Fig. 15(b).

To prove that our work is valid, scalable and robust across dif-
ferent data sets, we show the performance of steady state trust
values using a bigger subset of the Irish dataset with 1000 houses
for deductive attacks with lower margins of false data. Figs. 16(a)
and 16(b), shows trust value distribution and classi(cid:27)cation perfor-
mance for δav❕ = 500 and δav❕ = 600. We see that even for a large
and di(cid:29)erent region, with lower δav❕ than Texas data, the false
alarm and missed detection rates are 9% and 8%. A performance
accuracy for 5000 houses over all δav❕ and ρmal values and our
comparison with existing works is shown later in Sec. 6.9.

6.5 Time to Detection of Compromised Meters
One key advantage of our work is that it allows for quick identi(cid:27)-
cation of compromised meters compared to most accurate classi(cid:27)-
cation based methods [8, 9]. Fig. 17(a), shows that di(cid:29)erence in the
evolution of trust values after the attack is launched. Since, it is not
legible to show every single meter in one plot, we plot the average
trust of the compromised set and the average trust of the honest
set over time. Fig. 17(a) shows that the average trust of compro-
mised set of meters falls below the threshold within 10 days from
the start of attack. Therefore steady state as described in Figs. 14(a)
and 14(b) is achieved within 10 days on average. Hence, rogue me-
ters are identi(cid:27)ed before drastic damages have been in(cid:30)icted.
6.6 Classi(cid:27)cation against Isolated Attacks
Although, our work is focussed on defending against orchestrated
attacks, with large number of compromised meters, our work is
still valid in identifying isolated malicious meters that may act
alone. In such isolated attacks, the ratio drop may not be observ-
ably signi(cid:27)cant unless δav❕ is abnormally high. However, this is
not necessary as such isolated attacks in such cases would not dras-
tically a(cid:29)ect the means and get revealed through the discrete rating
criterion and the proposed trust model. As an evidence, the trust of
two isolated meters launching additive and deductive attacks with
δav❕ = 600, (shown in Fig. 17(b)), is far less than other honest me-
ters. Hence, this is a proof of validity for isolated attacks. Hence
our defense model is sensitive to small scale low ρmal attacks.
6.7 Classi(cid:27)cation against Omission and
Incremental Attacks
Fig. 18(a), shows the evidence that the proposed model can de-
tect omission attacks, where 30% of the meters dropped the data.
Fig. 18(b), is the performance against incremental attacks after 45
days of the initial attack was launched. The amount of false data
was incremented by 2W per meter every 4 hours.

6.8 Avg. Performance over ρmal and δav❕
One bene(cid:27)t of our work is the robustness to higher fractions of
compromised meters compared to most consensus based methods
that fail when ρmal and/or the δav❕ is high. Fig. 19(a) and Fig. 19(b),
shows the average trust values of all compromised meters versus
honest ones. Our technique completely fails at 75% percentage
of compromised meters for a 200 house Texas dataset, which is
resilient. Similarly, Fig. 20(a), shows the average trust di(cid:29)erence
among compromised and honest sets of meters over various δav❕
under additive attacks, when ρmal = 50%. Fig. 20(b), shows the
performance of our model, when compromised meters alternate
true and false behavior periods based on pricing. We can observe,
that although the di(cid:29)erence between trusts are lesser than earlier
case, we can still classify the compromised ones.
