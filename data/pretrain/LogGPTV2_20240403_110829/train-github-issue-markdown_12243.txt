http://scikit-learn.org/dev/related_projects.html currently references
https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/wiki/Third-party-projects-and-
code-snippets but the latter duplicates a lot of the former's contents. Should
we retire it and merge any missing (and still relevant) content into
related_projects?
