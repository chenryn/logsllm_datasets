by  a  participant.  For  example,  a  single  problematic  image  grid 
could reduce login success rates considerably, whereas in reality 
this  would  reduce  the per click success rate less severely. There 
was  a  significant  difference  between  the  success  rates  in  the 
dissimilar  condition  (90%)  and  the  similar  condition  (67%) 
Î§2(1,N  =916)=57.679,  p3) in pairwise similarity values. Even without 
knowledge of the threshold the attacker could make a good guess 
at its value based upon the minimal d observed for each image in 
the matrix.  
6.2  Exhaustive filtering 
The analysis of key relative filtering has shown that for purposes 
of security a more holistic approach to image filtering should be 
taken,  in  order  to  hide  traces  of  the  filtering  procedure.  One 
approach  is  based  upon  ensuring  a  minimum  distance  exists 
between all images in the grid. One limitation of this approach is 
that while it enforces a minimal distance between all images, there 
is  no  upper  bound,  which  could  leave  the  login  vulnerable  to 
observation  attack,  as  images  exhibiting  large  visual  differences 
could remain in the login challenge. An alternative approach that 
could  eliminate  this  threat  is  based  upon  similarity  intervals, 
where additionally an upper bound of similarity is also enforced. 
However, this approach would likely be difficult to implement in 
small image collections, as a greater number of images are likely 
to  be  rejected  due  to  the  increased  number  of  similarity 
constraints upon a permissible image. There is a trade-off between 
the  volume  of images rejected in the filtering procedure  and the 
number  of  constraints  that  are  enforced.  As  a  compromise,  a 
minimum  distance  approach  is  likely  to  be  suitable  in  smaller 
image  sets  and  where  observation  attack  or  description  is  less 
likely  to  be  a  threat.    An  example  of  the  visual  differences  that 
may  result  is  illustrated  in  Figure  9.  In  order  to  minimize  the 
106
number  of  images  that  must  be  rejected,  a  useful  strategy  in 
general involves: 
1.  Choosing a strategy for decoy selection i.e. similarity or 
dissimilarity. 
2.  Choosing a candidate key image, and calculating the 
distribution of pairwise similarity between it and the rest 
of the image set.  
3.  Sorting the images in ascending order of EMD, then, if 
choosing for dissimilarity, choosing from the back of 
the list, and if choosing for similarity, choosing from the 
front of the list. 
4.  Repeating 2-4 for each key image.

7.  DISCUSSION 
The vision of this research is that a system can take an arbitrary 
set  of  images  and  perform  a  filtering  operation  to  generate  a 
usable and secure login challenge, or else conclude that an image 
set  does  not  contain  suitable  images  for  this  purpose.  Such  a 
spontaneous  approach  to  the  generation  of  a  login  challenge 
becomes  more  useful  when  considering  deployment 
level 
phenomena  such  as  password  resets,  where  ineffective  recycling 
of  images  could  cause  confusion  between  new  key  images  and 
old. A perfect automated semantic separation of images appears to 
be a difficult goal; however, we have shown that taking a coarse 
grained approach to the problem can affect usability. As a result it 
seems possible that ensuring a specific visual difference between 
images  using  pixel-level 
in 
automated 
image  selection  strategies  for  recognition-based 
graphical passwords.    
The  recall  test  results  suggest  that  comparison  of  pixel-level 
image  signatures  can  affect  the  usability  of  recognition-based 
graphical passwords in terms of both user accuracy and the time
