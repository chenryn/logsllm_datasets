reaches the path output is the maximum for the charge con-
sidered. Thus, by varying the output capacitance and the
charge collected around the P-N junction (up to a maxi-
mum of 300fC), we constructed look-up tables for the tran-
sient pulse width versus critical charge. Once QCRIT of the
gates are known, SER of the complete circuit was calcu-
lated as described in [9].
5.2. SER reduction for combined error detection
and masking
We ﬁrst estimate the slack Smax available at each ﬂip-
ﬂop for sampling the PO values. We constructed the orig-
inal and modiﬁed C2MOS ﬂip-ﬂop (shown in Fig. 1) and

simulated the circuits using TSMC 0.18 micron models.
The setup and hold time for both the ﬂip-ﬂops were mea-
sured by connecting them to a FO4 inverter load. The value
for tD−clk, tD−C2, and tclk−Q in the modiﬁed design were
found to be 125, 115, and 50ps., respectively. A delay
chain capable of generating phase shifted clock signals ev-
ery 200ps was constructed and hence the sampling time t1
and t2 were determined from the control signal availabil-
ity. The width of transient pulse that can be tolerated in the
w is then calculated as min(t3−t2, t2−t1).
modiﬁed circuit t(cid:1)
The charge required to cause a transient pulse of width t(cid:1)
and tw = 100ps are then obtained from the lookup table.

In Table 1, the column Ntrig represents the number of
ﬂip-ﬂops (FF) modiﬁed. Sub-column E.M. gives the num-
ber of FFs where error masking was used, while EDAC
gives the number of POs connected to ﬂip-ﬂops shown in
ﬁgure 1. As the average number of paths on which EDAC
is applied corresponds to 5.6, domino logic can be used to
generate ED signals without much delay. The average SER
reduction on using error masking alone is 82.67%, while
combining error masking with EDAC raised it to 93.78%.
The original area of ISCAS85 circuits were obtained from
Synopsys design compiler, while the area overhead is equal
to the sum of area occupied by the delay lines and associ-
ated buffers, the modiﬁed FFs, circuit required to generate
ED signals, and a ﬁve percent wiring overhead. The over-
head for generating PS signals are not included as the IS-
CAS85 circuits considered are not pipelined.
The area overhead depends on the number of modiﬁed
FFs, the number of distinct sampling times and the maxi-
mum sampling time which contribute to the delay element
overhead. If a number of sampling times are close together,
then the delay element overhead can be reduced more (by
clustering) without signiﬁcant loss of SER reduction, as
compared to circuits with sampling times wide apart. The
delay lines can be shared across multiple modules which
would further reduce their area as well as power overheads.
The power consumed by the original ISCAS85 circuits was
estimated in Primepower using zero delay model (i.e. de-
lays and switching activity have not been back annotated).
The power overhead is estimated by constructing the delay
chain required to generate the control signals and then doing
a SPICE simulation on them. The output load on each delay
tap was approximately estimated as the sum of the input ca-
pacitances of the control transistors switched by the delay
taps. The average power overhead in practice would reduce
due to a couple reasons (1) The original power has been es-
timated using zero delay model, which does not take into
account glitchy or partial transitions. (2) The leakage en-
ergy consumed by the overhead circuit is far lower than the
leakage of the circuit due to fewer components. In compar-

ing the SER reduction achieved versus the time
borrowed.
ison to the overhead of 200% obtained from existing tech-
niques, the overheads incurred by the technique presented
are signiﬁcantly lower.
The results presented here are for zero delay over-
head i.e.,
the critical path delay is not affected. Bal-
anced static CMOS circuits attenuate noise pulses within
four stages [20], which reduces the SER of such cir-
cuits. However, if the ISCAS85 circuits used were syn-
thesized with delay balanced paths the ratio of SER re-
duction to area and power overhead would have been
much lower (overhead is greater) compared to the tech-
nique presented in this paper. This is because delay
elements have to be inserted in each of the individual un-
balanced paths.
5.3. SER reduction for slack redistribution
In order to simulate the effect of time borrowing on SER
reduction when using error masking alone, we increase the
slack available across all paths and recalculated the SER re-
duction. Slack available in all paths were increased up to
0.2×T, where T is the clock period time. The results are
plotted in Figure 5. As can be seen, SER reduces with small
increase in the slack time. SER reduction in C432 increases
from 52% to 82% as time borrowed is increased from
0.05×T to 0.1×T. This is because the number of latches
that are triggered and used for sampling doubles from three
to six when the time borrowed increases to 0.1×T.
6. Conclusions
We presented an efﬁcient time redundancy based design
technique for error masking and recovery. This technique

can be used to improve the reliability of a circuit by reduc-
ing transient faults caused due to cross-talk or soft errors
due to particle strikes without any performance overhead.
The power and area overhead can be traded-off based on
the application SER requirements. A technique for prevent-
ing SEMUs from affecting the latched value and hence the
CLB output was presented. Results show an average SER
reduction of 93.78%, with reasonable area and power over-
heads and with zero performance overhead, which is signif-
icantly better compared to any of the current techniques.
