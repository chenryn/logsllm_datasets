User: Please list the commonly used data structures and usage scenarios in Python
Assistant: 1. List (List) - store a set of ordered elements, often used to store and manipulate a set of data. 2. Tuple——similar to a list, but the elements cannot be changed. It is often used as the key of a dictionary or some immutable data. 3. Set (Set) - store a set of unordered, unique elements of data, often used for deduplication or calculation. 4. Dictionary (Dictionary) - store data in the form of key-value pairs, often used to store, find and update a set of data. 5. Stack (Stack) - a last-in-first-out data structure, often used in recursive functions to store local variables, calculate expressions, etc. 6. Queue (Queue) - a first-in first-out data structure, often used in scenarios such as breadth-first traversal. 7. Heap (Heap) - a special tree data structure, often used to dynamically solve the problem of maximum or minimum value (such as heap sort). 8. Linked List (Linked List) - a linear data structure composed of nodes, often used to manipulate large amounts of data, store complex data structures, etc.
