Hey,
Recently I've been putting together a page that has a lot of data. I'd like to
consolidate this more by adding a scrollable feature to my table, however,
overflowing the table in y with a max height causes the header to scroll. I've
tried several CSS tricks and looked all over the internet for a solution. Most
people suggest turning tbody into a block element, however this messes up all
of the column formatting.
Having the ability to do something similar to <table class="table table-
bordered table-scroll table-fixed-header" .... would be awesome.
