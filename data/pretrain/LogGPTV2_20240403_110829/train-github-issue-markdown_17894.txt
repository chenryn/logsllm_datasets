Hello, this is a feature request, not a bug report (I guess). To dynamically
load form contents, like a select list for an entity or choice type, we have
the posibility to use form events and there are some tutorials to do so. When
this load involves multiple levels and the events are fired in cascade, this
events mechanism, is, to say the less, not developer friendly, I've seen some
tutorials but always find them difficult to adapt to my own needs.
The method I actually would prefer is handling events with pure Ajax, calling
controller methods from javascript that return a JSON with dynamic new values,
but here is the problem: if I load a select field (choice or entity) with
options that where not present when the form was created I receive some
errors:
> ConstraintViolation  
>  TransformationFailedException: message: "Unable to reverse value for
> property path "XXX": The choice "40" does not exist or is not unique"  
>  TransformationFailedException: message: "The choice "40" does not exist or
> is not unique"
So my request is to allow developers to choose a server based mechanism, like
form events, or an ajax based method, allowing new values for choice and
entity fields. Maybe what I'm asking crashes completely with the Symfony way
of doing things :-P but I don't think I'm the only one who finds cascade form
events not developer friendly.
Thank you
