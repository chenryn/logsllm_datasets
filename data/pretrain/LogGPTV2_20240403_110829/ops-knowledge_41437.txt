User: I seem to have screwed up my Python install on my Mac (running OSX 10.10.3), I can run python but not easy_install. Running easy_install just gives me

sudo: easy_install: command not found

However, sudo easy_install-3.4 pip doesn't give me any error but when I then try to use pip using pip install gevent I get

-bash: /usr/local/bin/pip: No such file or directory

If I use pip3.4 install geventI get a long set of errors ending with

How can I restore my Python setup?
