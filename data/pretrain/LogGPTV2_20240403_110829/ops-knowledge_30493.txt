### Understanding How Google Determines a "Familiar" Device or Location

**Context:**
- **Browser:** Chrome
- **Signed-in Status:** Not signed in to Chrome
- **Homepage:** `chrome://newtab/`
- **Actions Taken:**
  - Deleted all cookies and site data.
  - Closed and reopened the browser.
  - Confirmed that the list of "All Cookies and Site Data" is blank.
  - Navigated to `https://mail.google.com/`.
  - Redirected to a URL starting with `accounts.google.com`, where three cookies are set (one from `google.com` and two from `accounts.google.com`).
  - Entered Gmail address and clicked "Next".
  - Observed a non-generic profile picture and a message indicating that personalization will only occur if signing in from a familiar device or location.

**Question:**
How does Google determine if a device or location is "familiar"?

**Observations and Analysis:**

1. **IP Address:**
   - Google likely uses the IP address as one of the factors to determine familiarity. However, it is not solely based on the geographic location of the IP address, as multiple IP addresses can point to the same location.
   - I tested this by using a virtual machine (VM) with the same external IP address but which had never been used to log into my Google account. The Google account page still displayed my profile picture, suggesting that the IP address alone is not the sole determinant.

2. **Browser Cookies:**
   - Browser cookies play a significant role in determining familiarity. When I cleared all cookies on browser close, my device was not marked as familiar in new locations.
   - Allowing cookies to persist, even when logging in from a different location, resulted in my device being marked as familiar. This indicates that cookies are a key factor in the determination process.

3. **Google's Documentation:**
   - According to a Google FAQ, they show a personalized sign-in screen with your profile picture and full name if you are signing in from a location or device you have used before, such as your home computer.

**Summary:**
Google determines a "familiar" device or location based on a combination of:
- **IP Address:** While the IP address is a factor, it is not solely based on the geographic location.
- **Browser Cookies:** Persistent cookies are crucial for recognizing a familiar device or location.

By understanding these factors, you can better manage how Google recognizes your devices and locations.
