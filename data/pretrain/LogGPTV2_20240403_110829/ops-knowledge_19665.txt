User: How to configure unattended automatic installation (Unattended Installation) to reduce labor and time costs?
Assistant: Configuring unattended automatic installation can greatly reduce labor and time costs. The following are some steps and tips: 1. Prepare the specified operating system image and installation files, as well as the unattended installation tools used (such as Microsoft Deployment Toolkit, Windows Deployment Services, etc.). 2. Create an answer file that contains customized settings and an answer file. This file should include settings for operating system, application and driver installation. 3. Create a separate answer file or instruction file for each software program and driver that needs to be installed to ensure that the correct settings are always used during installation. 4. Set up an automated process for the unattended installer using an automation script to run the answer file or directive file automatically. 5. Test and verify the unattended installation to ensure that all settings and programs are installed correctly and run successfully. 6. Configure the automation process for the unattended installer so that the installer starts and runs automatically on the computer that needs to be installed. 7. Automate the steps of logging out and entering custom user accounts to simplify subsequent system configuration and management. 8. Ensure that the unattended installer process runs successfully across multiple hardware configurations to minimize the need for human intervention. In conclusion, achieving unattended automatic installation requires careful planning and preparation, but will greatly reduce labor and time costs, and maximize the consistency and accuracy of system configuration.
