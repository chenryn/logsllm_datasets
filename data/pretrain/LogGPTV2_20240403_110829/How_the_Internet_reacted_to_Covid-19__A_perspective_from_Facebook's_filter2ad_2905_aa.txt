## Abstract
The Covid-19 pandemic has led to unprecedented changes in human interactions, placing significant pressure on the Internet. This paper provides an analysis of the scale of Internet traffic growth and the Internet's ability to handle the increased demand, as observed from Facebook's edge network. We use this infrastructure, which serves multiple large social networks and their related apps, to analyze how traffic and product properties changed during the early stages of the pandemic. Our findings reveal shifts in traffic demand, user behavior, and user experience, with varying impacts across different regions, particularly in less developed areas.

## 1. Introduction
The Covid-19 pandemic is a global crisis without precedent in recent history, comparable only to the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic. Many countries have implemented lockdown measures, leading to the closure of offices, schools, restaurants, and other venues. These sudden and unpredictable changes in behavior have also altered how Internet products are consumed and used.

In this paper, we study how changes in user behavior affected the demand for Internet egress traffic and discuss the implications on the network and user-perceived Quality of Experience (QoE). The main contributions of this paper are:

- **Traffic Uptake and Stability:** We show that the pandemic caused a sharp increase in traffic, but this surge was limited to a short period, followed by a phase of increased but stable request volume. The initial traffic surge exhibited regional differences in timing and growth.
- **Changes in User Behavior:** We observe significant changes in user behavior, resulting in new traffic trends across products and access types. Livestream services saw a surge in popularity, though their contribution to overall traffic was small. Messaging services also saw increased usage, with variable traffic implications across regions. Traditional social media services, like video, showed relatively lower growth, but their high initial volume contributed significantly to global traffic.
- **Regional Impact and Recovery:** The Internet did not cope uniformly with the increased traffic. While North America and Europe showed no signs of network stress, regions such as India, parts of Sub-Saharan Africa, and South America experienced network stress. However, measures taken by operators, such as traffic rate limiting and video bitrate capping, allowed networks to recover to pre-pandemic performance levels relatively quickly.

## 2. Vantage Point
For this study, we use Facebook's global edge network as our vantage point. This network serves over 2.5 billion monthly active users and includes a series of Points of Presence (PoPs) and off-net cache servers interconnected across six continents. The network maintains interconnections with all major ISPs and serves peak traffic exceeding 100 Tbps. We acknowledge that while this network provides a significant view of the Internet, it is still a single network perspective.

## 3. Traffic Perspective
We begin by examining the global traffic footprint using sFlow sampling at all edge locations. Figure 1 shows the world-wide total traffic throughput relative to January 1, 2020, with a smoothed line representing the seven-day rolling average. The data reveals a steady growth in traffic until the second half of March 2020, followed by a significant increase and then a plateau. The highest egress rate was 38.7% higher than the lowest average traffic rate. Toward the end of the observation period, traffic volumes started to decrease, indicating that some of the initial growth was due to adaptation to life under the pandemic.

To understand the regional impact, we segment the global egress data by region. Figure 2 shows the egress rates for different regions, with a seven-day rolling average. The growth phases correlate with the spread of Covid-19, with Europe seeing an expedited growth in traffic before North America, and both converging to similar traffic levels. South America and Asia showed delayed and smaller growth, respectively.

Figure 3 further highlights the week-over-week changes in edge egress traffic volume, showing that continent-level traffic growth follows the development of the pandemic, with clear peaks in traffic growth coinciding with new response measures.

## 4. Traffic and User Behavior
We now focus on user behavior, using CDN access logs to understand changes during the lockdown. This allows a more granular dissection of individual requests, though it does not account for a small amount of non-CDN traffic.

### Product-Based Overview
We analyze the four main product categories: messaging, livestreaming, video, and photo. Livestreaming saw an exponential surge in popularity, though its contribution to overall traffic remains minimal. Messaging services grew globally, with high traffic growth rates in Europe and parts of South America, followed by India and Sub-Saharan Africa. Video products grew by about 5% globally, with higher rates in North America, Europe, and India, and lower rates in Africa.

### Access-Based Overview
We examine how lockdown measures changed content consumption, specifically whether there was a shift towards broadband or mobile access. Figure 5 shows the relative growth of CDN traffic, grouped by mobile and broadband networks. Broadband consumption saw the most significant growth, with a small increase in mobile traffic in the second half of March. The largest growth for both access types occurred on March 28, 2020, with broadband traffic increasing by 1.41x and mobile traffic by 1.24x compared to the preceding period.

## 5. How ISPs Handled Increased Traffic
We assess whether the Internet could cope with the increased traffic, looking at user-centric indicators like video QoE and network-centric indicators like traffic overflow and round-trip times. Table 4 provides country abbreviations used in this section.

### Video Engagement Overview
We analyze video traffic, computing the percentage difference in daily video watchtime and viewership between the pre- and post-Covid-19 periods. Video engagement growth is the average of these two metrics. We calculate this for selected countries based on factors such as Covid-19 exposure and geographic diversity.

### Network Performance
We find that while North America and Europe did not show signs of network stress, regions like India, parts of Sub-Saharan Africa, and South America experienced network stress. However, measures taken by operators, such as traffic rate limiting and video bitrate capping, allowed networks to recover to pre-pandemic performance levels relatively quickly.

## Conclusion
The Covid-19 pandemic had a profound impact on Internet traffic, with significant regional variations. Our analysis from Facebook's edge network provides insights into the changes in traffic demand, user behavior, and network performance, highlighting the resilience and adaptability of the Internet infrastructure.
