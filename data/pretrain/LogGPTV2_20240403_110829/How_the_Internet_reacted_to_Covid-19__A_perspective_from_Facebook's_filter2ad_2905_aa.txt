ABSTRACT
The Covid-19 pandemic has led to unprecedented changes in the
way people interact with each other, which as a consequence has
increased pressure on the Internet. In this paper we provide a per-
spective of the scale of Internet traffic growth and how well the
Internet coped with the increased demand as seen from Facebook’s
edge network.
We use this infrastructure serving multiple large social networks
and their related family of apps as vantage points to analyze how
traffic and product properties changed over the course of the be-
ginning of the Covid-19 pandemic. We show that there have been
changes in traffic demand, user behavior and user experience. We
also show that different regions of the world saw different magni-
tudes of impact with predominantly less developed regions exhibit-
ing larger performance degradations.

1 INTRODUCTION
The Covid-19 pandemic is a global crisis without precedent in recent
history. The only other event which comes close is the 1918 Spanish
flu pandemic. Many countries world-wide have imposed lock-down
measures of varying degrees, leading to closures of offices, schools,
restaurants, factories and other venues.
This sudden and unpredictable change in people’s behavior also
changed the way Internet products are consumed and used. In this
paper we study how changes in user behavior affected demand for
Internet egress traffic. We also discuss implications of these changes
on the network and on user perceived Quality of Experience (QoE).
The main contributions of this paper are the following:
• We show that the pandemic caused a sharp uptake in traffic,
but that this uptake was limited to a short period of time only.
This uptake was followed by a phase of increased but stable

request volume. The initial traffic surge exhibited regional
differences both in terms of timing and growth.
• We show a significant change in user behavior translating
into new traffic trends across products and access types. We
observe a surge in popularity of livestream services, although
the contribution of this growth to overall traffic is small. We
likewise observe a surge in popularity of messaging with
variable traffic implications across regions. On the other
hand despite relatively lower growth of more traditional
social media services like video, the high initial volume of
those services led to a significant increase of global traffic.
• We show that the Internet did not cope with this increase in
traffic in the same way globally. While North America and
Europe did not show any signs of stress in their networks,
India, parts of Sub-Saharan Africa and South America did
witness signs of network stress coinciding with the traffic
surges in the second half of March. Nevertheless, measures
taken by operators (like traffic rate limiting or video bitrate
capping) and the eventual stabilization of network traffic did
allow networks to recover to their pre-Covid-19 performance
levels relatively quickly.
2 VANTAGE POINT
For this paper we use Facebook’s global edge network as a vantage
point. That is, we only consider user-facing traffic and disregard any
internal traffic like intra- or inter-datacenter traffic. Hence we will
refer to this traffic as edge traffic. This network serves Facebook’s
over 2.5 billion monthly active users distributed around the world.
This network comprises a series of PoPs and off-net cache servers
with interconnections spread across six continents. This network
maintains interconnections with all major ISPs in all regions and at
peak serves traffic in excess of 100Tbps. We observe tens of trillions
of traffic flows every day. Although this size and footprint allow
us to see a significant fraction of the Internet, we acknowledge

that this paper nevertheless only provides the view from this single
network.
3 TRAFFIC PERSPECTIVE
We start by looking at the global traffic footprint. Data is obtained
via sFlow sampling on all edge locations at which traffic leaves
our network. Figure 1 shows the network’s world-wide total traffic
throughput relative to the traffic of January 01, 2020. We depict the
data as a time series, showing strong diurnal and weekly patterns.
As daily and weekly fluctuations make it hard to discern longer
term trends from these shorter term fluctuations, we additionally
calculate average traffic rates over the preceding seven days using
a rolling window. This is depicted as the smoothed line in the same
figure. This way we provide the detailed time series which allows
for the differentiation of different days along with the smoothed
time series which is better suited to identify the long term trend in
the same figure.
In the figure we can see a steady growth in traffic until the second
half of March 2020. This traffic growth is expected as it reflects
the organic growth of the underlying platform and social network.
We observe a significant increase in traffic rate over the second
half of March, which then plateaus over April until the end of July.
Over the observation period, the seven day period with the highest
egress rate has 38.7% more traffic egress compared to the seven day
period with the lowest average traffic rate. Toward the end of the
observation period, traffic volumes start to decrease again. This is
remarkable, as it shows two things. First, from a global perspective
we quickly reached a new normal. Once people adapted to new
behaviors and routines traffic growth plateaued. Second, we see
small decreases in traffic volume, especially toward the end of the
observation period. This indicates that at least some fraction of the
initial traffic growth was caused by the adaption to life under the
pandemic and its lock-down conditions.
To get a perspective on how and when Covid-19 has impacted
traffic in different regions of the world, we segment our global
egress data by region. We choose this segmentation to understand
how individual regions have fared as a whole, while at the same
time averaging away differences between countries in the same
region. Figure 2 shows the observed egress rates for the different

region (c.f. Table 2).
regions. For the sake of readability, we only show seven day rolling
averages without the underlying time series. The figure shows a
growth in egress in the second half of March, followed by a phase
of stability from April to May.
The growth phases in the different regions correlate with the
spread of Covid-19. Until the middle of March, North America and
Europe show about the same traffic volumes, from then on Europe
sees an expedited growth in traffic while traffic levels in North
America remain stable. Europe then begins to plateau, while about
two weeks later North America sees expedited traffic growth at
comparable rates to those seen in Europe. This coincides with the
major outbreaks and countermeasures taken by governments in
both regions. Interestingly, both regions converge to the same traffic
levels before and after their growth phase. South America shows
similar, albeit delayed behavior. In contrast, Asia exhibits a small
dip in traffic volume prior to the phase of strong growth.
To further assess differences in growth in the different regions,
we show relative week over week changes in edge egress traffic
volume in Figure 3. We chose to show only four continents as these
regions are the main traffic destinations for our network. For this
figure we calculated average rates over seven days rolling windows
to compensate for weekly and daily shifts in traffic patterns.
The figure highlights two findings. First, in line with the previous
figure, continent level traffic growth follows the development of the
pandemic: The peak of growth in Europe occurs first, followed by
North- and South America and then Asia. Second, for all continents,
we observe a clear peak in traffic growth. This suggests that the
pandemic-related traffic growth is limited to a short period of time,
which seems to coincide with novel response measures being put
in place.
4 TRAFFIC AND USER BEHAVIOR
In this section we shift focus to the users. We try to understand what
the traffic shift from the previous section tells us about changes
in user behavior during lockdown. We use access logs from our
CDN infrastructure. In contrast to the sFlow data from the previous
section, this allows a more granular dissection of individual requests.
The drawback of this approach is that we do not account for a small

lines mark the implementation date of lockdown measures
in the largest country per region (c.f. Table 2).
Despite a lower global growth rate than livestreaming products,
growth in video products proved to have higher traffic impact given
that, in terms of volume, video represents a higher share of overall
traffic.
Access-based overview: In this section, we try to understand
how lock-down measures have changed the way content is con-
sumed. More specifically we are interested in whether we see more
requests using broadband or mobile access technology. CDN log-
ging infers access type based on client or in the case of CGNAT
carrier IP, which we use to divide CDN requests into two groups:
One group which contains all requests made via the networks of
mobile operators, and the second group containing all requests
made via fixed lines or broadband. Figure 5 shows the relative
growth of CDN traffic, grouped by mobile and broadband networks.
As with the previous figures, we show the raw timeline as well as
the seven days rolling averages. The figure shows that it is largely
broadband consumption where we see traffic growth. We observe
a small increase in traffic on mobile networks in the second half of
March, but the overall consumption level remains relatively stable.
For both access types we observe the largest growth on March 28,
2020. For broadband we observed more than 1.41x as much traffic
as in the preceding period, for mobile this peak growth is 1.24x the
value of the preceding period.
5 HOW ISPS HANDLED INCREASED TRAFFIC
In this section we attempt to answer whether the Internet was able
to cope with increased traffic. We look at user-centric indicators like
video QoE as well as network-centric indicators like traffic overflow
to public exchanges or transit and round-trip times. We provide
these measures as non-exhaustive indicators of path congestion.
See Table 4 for the country abbreviations used in this Section.
Video engagement overview: We analyze video traffic as it is
one of the products with high traffic weight globally. We compute
video watchtime growth in a given country by assessing the per-
centage difference between the average daily video watchtime in
the week pre-Covid-19 traffic surge and the average daily video
watchtime in the week post-Covid-19 traffic surge. We use the
same methodology for assessing video viewership growth. Video
engagement growth is the average of video watchtime and video
viewership growth. We calculate video engagement growth for a
number of countries that we select based on a mix of factors includ-
ing Covid-19 exposure (high number of Covid cases), geographic

amount of traffic which is not served from the CDN (e.g., DNS
traffic). The difference in peak traffic throughput between both
datasets is 6%.
Product-based overview: We first want to understand which
products people consumed more during lockdown. We particularly
focus on the four product categories messaging, livestreaming,
video and photo as these represent the main services provided
by the Facebook family of apps. We use traffic growth of these
products pre- and post-Covid-19 as an approximate for changes in
user behavior. While we acknowledge that traffic growth per se is
not the only measure of changes in user behavior, we use it as an
approximate measure that can easily be computed solely through
CDN logs.
We compute traffic growth per product type and geography
as follows: For each geography we leverage observations from
the previous section to identify the dates around which a surge in
overall traffic (in bps) for all products combined has been observed.1
Table 3 lists the dates we used for this paper. Traffic growth rate per
product and geography then is the percentage difference between
average daily traffic peak rates in the week just before and the week
just after the traffic surge.
We compute global, regional and local traffic growth rates for the
four product categories. Figure 4 showcases averaged growth rates
of these products across Europe, USA and India. Despite regional
variations, livestreaming products witnessed an exponential surge
in popularity while their contribution to the overall traffic, which
we cannot quantify any further, remains minimal.
The usage of messaging services grew globally with high traffic
growth rates particularly in Europe and parts of South America,
followed by India and Sub-Saharan Africa where messaging apps
were already popular pre-Covid-19. Messaging traffic contribution
to overall CDN traffic post-Covid-19 varies per country and region
with the highest traffic impact observed in India, Sub-Saharan Africa
and Spain. Video products grew around 5% globally, with higher
rates in North America, Europe and India and lower rates in Africa.
1Computing traffic growth per product and geography requires identifying the dates
of the traffic surge. If the considered geography is a region or continent rather than a
country, a precondition is to have different countries within this region witnessing
the traffic surge around the same dates (which is the case for instance for the EU).
