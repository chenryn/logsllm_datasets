Question: Why is it not recommended for Bob to send his private key to Alice to facilitate encrypted communication?
"A": "Because if Bob sends his private key, anyone intercepting it could decrypt all messages intended for Bob, compromising the security of their communication.",
"B": "Since Alice does not need Bob's private key to encrypt messages, sending it only increases the risk of exposure without any benefit to the encryption process.",
"C": "Bob's private key is designed to encrypt messages, not decrypt them, so sending it to Alice would not help in secure communication.",
"D": "Sending the private key is unnecessary because Alice can use her own private key to encrypt the messages, ensuring that only she can decrypt them with her public key."
Answer: AB
