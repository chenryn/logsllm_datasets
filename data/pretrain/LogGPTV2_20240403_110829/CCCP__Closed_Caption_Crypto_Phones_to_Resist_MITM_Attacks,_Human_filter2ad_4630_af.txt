### Manual Analysis of Transcription Samples

We conducted a manual analysis of several transcription samples and observed that homophones—words that sound the same but have different meanings and spellings (e.g., "ate" and "eight")—are often transcribed inaccurately in our application. By removing these homophones from our dataset, we were able to improve the overall Word Error Rate (WER) from approximately 10% to 9%. Based on this finding, we suggest that future research should focus on designing a dictionary of words that are more accurately transcribed by our tools, such as avoiding the inclusion of homophones.

### Integration with Other Defenses

An orthogonal defense against data or voice Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks is the detection of the caller's source. One notable approach is PinDr0p, which determines the call's origin and the path it takes [43]. This technique analyzes audio features to identify voice codecs, packet loss, and noise profiles, thereby identifying the caller. However, this method alone may not fully detect an MITM attacker who is on the same network as the victim. Another recent approach is AuthLoop [53], which provides authentication within the voice channel without requiring an Internet connection for key exchange. Unlike Crypto Phones, AuthLoop authenticates callers solely through the voice channel. We believe that CCCP (Checksum Comparison for Crypto Phones) can be used independently or in conjunction with these existing techniques, and further integration could be explored in future work.

### Potential Sophisticated Attacks on Transcription

Recent studies have proposed sophisticated attacks on transcription technology [45, 61]. These attacks generate audio samples that are unintelligible to humans but interpretable by transcribers, potentially allowing attackers to execute hidden commands on virtual personal assistant apps. Although such attacks could theoretically apply to the automated Checksum Comparison task in CCCP, we assume that in a phone conversation, the user who answers the call (and optionally verifies the speaker) would likely detect such suspiciously malformed (robotic-sounding) audio samples. A more detailed study is needed to evaluate the practicality and impact of these attacks in the context of CCCP.

### Conclusions

In this paper, we introduced and evaluated CCCP, a novel approach to Crypto Phones that leverages speech transcription. CCCP automates the checksum comparison process, reducing reliance on human users who are prone to errors or may simply bypass such decisions. Our work demonstrates that CCCP can fully detect mismatched checksums, effectively countering MITM attacks that only tamper with the data channel. Additionally, CCCP significantly reduces the likelihood of rejecting matching checksums compared to traditional methods, thereby improving the success rate of establishing secure calls/connections. CCCP also supports the use of longer checksums, which enhance the security provided by the underlying cryptographic protocols.

By automating the checksum comparison, CCCP relieves users of the burden of performing this task, allowing them to focus solely on validating the identity of the checksum-announcing speaker. This simplification may help increase the robustness of human users in detecting even more sophisticated forms of MITM attacks that target both data and voice channels, particularly when compared to currently deployed Crypto Phones. However, this comes at the cost of increased delay due to the need to speak longer checksums.
