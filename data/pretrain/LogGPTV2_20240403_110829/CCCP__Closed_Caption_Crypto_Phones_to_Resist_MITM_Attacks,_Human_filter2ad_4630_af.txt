We manually analyzed several samples of the transcription and
observed that for instance, homophones that sound alike but have
different meanings and different spellings (e.g., ate and eight), are
not transcribed accurately in our application. By removing the
homophones from our data set, we observed that we may improve
the overall transcription WER from about 10% to about 9%. In this
12
light, as part of future research, we suggest designing a dictionary
of words that are generally transcribed more accurately by the tools
(e.g., avoiding homophones in the dictionary).
Integrating with Other Defenses: An orthogonal defense
against data or voice MITM attack is to detect the caller source.
An interesting caller detection approach is PinDr0p, which deter-
mines the source of the call and the path taken by a call [43]. This
technique detects and measures audio features to identify the voice
codecs, packet loss and noise profiles to identify the caller. However,
such approach on its own may not fully detect the MITM attacker
which resides on the same network as the victim. Another recent
approach to identify the entities in a call is AuthLoop [53], which
provides authentication within the voice channel. Unlike Crypto
Phones, AuthLoop does not require an Internet connection to ex-
change the keys, and it authenticates the callers solely within the
voice channel. We believe that CCCP is an independent solution
and may work in conjunction with these prior techniques. Such
integration may be explored in future work.
Potential Sophisticated Attacks on Transcription: Sophisti-
cated attacks against transcription technology have been proposed
in recent work [45, 61]. Such attacks produce audio samples unin-
telligible (though audible) to the human user but interpretable by
the transcriber, and may be used to compromise virtual personal
assistant apps by running potentially hidden commands given by
the attacker. Although such attacks may be conceptually applicable
to the automated Checksum Comparison task in our scheme, we
assume that in a phone conversation, the user who attends the call
(and optionally verifies the speaker) can supposedly detect such
suspiciously malformed (robotically sounding) audio samples. A
careful further study is needed to evaluate the effect and practicality
of such attacks in the context of CCCP.
8 CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we introduced and studied CCCP, a novel approach to
Crypto Phones built on top of speech transcription. CCCP works by
automating the checksum comparison decisions, thereby reducing
the reliance on human users who are prone to making errors, or
even clicking-through, such decisions. Our work shows that CCCP
can fully detect mismatching checksums and therefore defeat man-
in-the-middle attacks that only tamper with the data channel (the
most realistic form of attack against any secure communication
protocol, including Crypto Phones). CCCP can also drastically re-
duce the chances of rejecting matching checksums compared to the
traditional approach, thereby improving the rates at which secure
calls/connections can be established. CCCP can optionally facilitate
the use of longer checksums. Longer checksums also increase the
security level provided by the underlying cryptographic protocols.
As an important side-effect of automating Checksum Compari-
son, CCCP unburden the users to only perform the single task of
validating the identity of the checksum announcing speaker. Our
work shows that this fundamental attribute may help increase the
robustness of human users in detecting even more sophisticated
forms of man-in-the-middle attacks that tamper with both data and
voice channels, especially when contrasted with currently deployed
Crypto Phones, although at the cost of increased delay in speaking
longer checksums.
