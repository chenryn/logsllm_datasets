**Code Snippet**
Help us help you! Put down a short code snippet that illustrates your bug and  
that we can run and debug locally. For example:
    const fileChooserPromise = window.waitForEvent('filechooser');
    await window.getByText('click to select file').click();
    const fileChooser = await fileChooserPromise;
    await fileChooser.setFiles(`./devices.xlsx`);
**Describe the bug**  
If file is too large(more than 50M), it will choose large files mode ,the
browser will get the file object containing path, such as {name: "devices.
xlsx", row: {name: "devices. xlsx", path: "xxxx/devices. xlsx"...}...},else
the browser will get the file object with the path properties is empty, such
as {name: "devices. xlsx", row: {name: "devices. xlsx", path: ""...}...}
