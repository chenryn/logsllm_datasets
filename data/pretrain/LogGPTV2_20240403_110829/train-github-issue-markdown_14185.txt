# I have a component the has the following in the template:
Last bid: {{newBid?.amount | number:'1.1-2'}}  
Bid time: {{newBid?.bidTime | date: 'medium'}}
This code works fine in Chrome and Firefox. But in Safari 9 I got an error
"Can't find variable: Intl" and then my date pipe. Removed the date pipe and
got the same error for my number pipe. Removed both pipes and the code started
working fine.
I believe this error has the same cause as #6009
I use Angular 2.0.0-beta.1 on MAC OS.
