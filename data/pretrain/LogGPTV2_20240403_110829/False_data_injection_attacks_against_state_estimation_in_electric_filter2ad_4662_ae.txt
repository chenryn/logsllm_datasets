meters to compromise and the number of speciﬁc state vari-
ables to compromise for the IEEE 300-bus system. Figure 7
shows the corresponding execution time of the Matching
Pursuit algorithm for ﬁnding an attack vector successfully.
We can see that the attacker needs to compromise 55–140
meters for the IEEE 300-bus system, if the attacker wants
to inject malicious data into as many as 10 state variables.
These meters can be quickly identiﬁed within 8 seconds.

Figure 5: Constrained case: Number of meters to

variable
We also exhaustively examine a special situation of tar-
geted false data injection attacks in the constrained case.
Speciﬁcally, for each state variable, we examine the number
of meters that need to be compromised if the attacker aims
at this variable. Figure 5 shows the results. We can see that
the attacker can inject malicious data into any single state
variable using less than 35 meters for the IEEE 118-bus sys-
tem and less than 40 meters for the IEEE 300-bus system.
For all the systems, none of the median values is greater than
10. This means that the attacker can aﬀect most of the state
variables by using at most 10 compromised meters.
In the constrained case, since c is ﬁxed, the attack vectors
can be directly computed. Thus, the execution time in all
the experiments is very short. For example, it costs only
1.2ms on the test computer to generate an attack vector
that injects false data into 10 state variables in the IEEE
300-bus system.
4.2.3 Results of Targeted False Data Injection At-
tacks in Unconstrained Case
In the unconstrained case, the attacker wants to inject
malicious data into speciﬁc state variables, but the attacker
does not have to keep the other state variables unchanged.
As discussed in Section 3.3.2, we use the Matching Pursuit
algorithm [19, 26, 27] to ﬁnd attack vectors. We perform the
same set of experiments as in Section 4.2.2 to obtain the two

We also exhaustively examine the special situation of in-
jecting malicious data into a single state variable for all the
IEEE test systems, as in the constrained case. Figures 8
and 9 show the number of meters to compromise for these
systems and the corresponding execution time, respectively.
As shown in Figures 8 and 9, for example, the attacker can
inject malicious data into any single state variable of the
IEEE 300-bus system by compromising at most 27 meters,
and it costs less than 2.6 seconds to ﬁnd the attack vector.
These experimental results indicate that the false data
injection attacks are practical and easy to launch if the at-

5. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, we presented a new class of attacks, called
false data injection attacks, against state estimation in elec-
tric power systems. We show that an attacker can take ad-
vantage of the conﬁguration of a power system to launch
such attacks to bypass the existing techniques for bad mea-
surement detection. We considered two realistic attack sce-
narios, where the attacker is either constrained to some spe-
ciﬁc meters, or limited in the resources required to compro-
mise meters. We showed that the attacker can systemati-
cally and eﬃciently construct attack vectors in both scenar-
ios, which can not only change the results of state estima-
tion, but also modify the results in a predicted way. We
performed simulation on IEEE test systems to demonstrate
the success of these attacks. Our results in this paper indi-
cate that security protection of the electric power grid must
be revisited when there are potentially malicious attacks.
In our future work, we would like to extend our results
to state estimation using AC power ﬂow models. Moreover,
we will also investigate the possibility of adapting network
anomaly detection techniques to identify false data injection
attacks.

IEEE TEST SYSTEMS
We validate the false data injection attacks through ex-
periments using IEEE test systems, including the IEEE 9-
bus, 14-bus, 30-bus, 118-bus, and 300-bus systems. We ex-
tract the conﬁguration of these test systems (particularly
the matrix H) from MATPOWER, a MATLAB package
for solving power ﬂow problems [37]. The information re-
garding the topology, bus data, and branch data can be
found from source ﬁles of MATPOWER. The names of these
source ﬁles are case9.m, case14.m, case30.m, case118.m,
and case300.m.
Table 3 shows the number of state variables and the num-
ber of measurements in the IEEE test systems. All these
systems are assumed to be fully measured. The matrix H’s
for the test systems are space consuming; we do not include
them here.
