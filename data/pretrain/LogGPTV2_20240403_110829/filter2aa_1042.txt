#### The Mission
**Scenario:**
- **Role:** A spy with a low budget.
- **Objective:** Gain persistent Command and Control (C&C) access to a hardened secure RDP (Remote Desktop) server containing confidential documents.
- **Requirements:**
  - Upload/download files
  - Interactive remote code execution

---

#### The Solution (in an Ideal World)
1. **Infect Client’s Desktop**
2. **Steal RDP Password**
3. **Connect to RDP**
4. **Drop Malware**
5. **Command and Control**
6. **Profit**

---

#### The Challenges
- **RDP Server Accessibility:**
  - Not reachable from the Internet directly.
  - Two-factor authentication is used.
  - No access to token seeds.
  - Drive mapping disabled (no direct file copy).
  - Restrictive hardware firewall (allows only TCP port 3389 IPv4).
  - Application whitelist (e.g., M$ Applocker with default policy).

**Realistic Environment:**
- Similar setup at a client.
- Limited time for exploitation.

---

#### Current Achievements
- **Remote Code Execution with C&C on a User’s Workstation**
- **Access to a Test RDP Server**
- **Knowledge of Files and Services on the Server**

**Post-Exploitation:**
- This is "Sparta" post-exploitation.

**Why Should You Care?**
- **Red Team/Pentesters:** New tools for exploitation.
- **Blue Team:** New things to look for during log analysis and incident response.
- **Policy Makers/Business:** Understanding the risks and potential vulnerabilities.

#### Divide et Impera!
**Break Down the Problem:**
1. Drop malware into the RDP server.
2. Execute any code on the RDP server.
3. Elevate to admin privileges.
4. Bypass the hardware firewall.

---

#### Step-by-Step Breakdown

1. **Drop Malware into RDP Server:**
   - Malware waits for the user to connect to the RDP server.
   - Creates a screenshot or animation, displays it in the foreground.
   - Optionally blocks user keyboard and mouse for ~20 seconds.
   - Uses the keyboard and clipboard to simulate user actions:
     - Starts M$ Word.
     - Drops encoded ASCII payload.
     - Creates macro code.
     - Macro writes binary.
     - Macro starts binaries.

**Alternative Usage:**
- Add directory to be excluded from AV scans using the AV GUI (if user has privileges and no UAC).
- Install a new trusted root certification authority and accept warnings to MiTM SSL connections (CA pinning does not stop this attack).

2. **Execute Any Code, Bypass AppLocker:**
   - **AppLocker Limitations:**
     - Controls VBScript, JScript, .bat, .cmd files, and Windows PowerShell scripts.
     - Does not control all interpreted code (e.g., Perl scripts and macros).
     - Applications can contain flags to bypass rules and load other .exe or .dll files.
     - Local administrators can modify AppLocker policies in the local GPO.
   - **Bypass Method:**
     - Load DLL with Word Macro.
     - Even shellcode execution is possible.
     - Example: `Private Declare PtrSafe Function LoadLibrary Lib "kernel32" Alias "LoadLibraryA" (ByVal lpLibFileName As String) As Long`

3. **Elevate to Admin:**
   - **Necessity:**
     - Required for the final phase (bypassing the hardware firewall).
   - **Possibilities:**
     - Exploit a local privilege escalation zero-day.
     - Exploit unpatched vulnerabilities.
     - Exploit vulnerable third-party program services.
   - **Service Exploit:**
     - Use `accesschk.exe` and `sc sdshow` to identify and exploit vulnerable services.

4. **Bypass Hardware Firewall:**
   - **Restrictions:**
     - No bind shell, reverse shell, or covert channel.
     - DNS, ICMP, IPv6, UDP, and proxy are not allowed.
     - No shell access.
   - **First Idea:**
     - Mark every packet with magic bytes and use a kernel network filter driver.
     - Problem: Requires rewriting or rerouting applications through a custom wrapper proxy.
   - **Second Idea:**
     - Use TCP source port (e.g., port 1337).
     - Limitations: NAT from the attacker side.
   - **Linux Implementation:**
     - Use kernel-level code to redirect traffic.
     - Example: `iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 22 --sport 1337 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 31337`
   - **Windows x64 Implementation:**
     - Install a trusted signed kernel driver (e.g., WinDivert project).
     - Alternatively, use PatchGuard bypass techniques.

#### Quiz
**Question:**
- What company published the first paper about packet filter firewalls in 1988?
- **Answer:** Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC)

---

#### Lessons Learned

**For Red Teams:**
- New tools for post-exploitation:
  - Tool to drop malware into the remote desktop.
  - Kernel driver to bypass/fool hardware firewalls if you have admin on a Windows server.

**For Blue Teams:**
- Every additional layer of security can still be bypassed.
- Restricted remote desktops are still a real interface for malware infection.
- Use application/protocol-aware (NG) firewalls instead of port-based ones.
- Do not trust firewall logs blindly.

**Code Release:**
- User simulator available as a Metasploit post module.
- HW FW bypass available as a Metasploit post module.
