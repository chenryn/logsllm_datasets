User: I installed Python 3.5 and virtualenv using Homebrew. python3 symlink in /usr/local/bin points to /usr/local/Cellar/python3/3.5.0/bin/python3, which means that when we execute a .py script using command python3, then the interpreter in the location above will be used.
But, when I see the contents of virtualenv in /usr/local/bin using cat virtualenv, the shebang is #!/usr/local/opt/python3/bin/python3.5, which means that when we execute virtualenv, then interpreter in /usr/local/opt is used.
Why is there a difference in the python interpreter being used? Which one should be used?
Assistant: Most likely, /usr/local/opt/python3 is a symlink actually pointing to /usr/local/Cellar/python3/3.5.0/bin/python3. ls -l /usr/local/opt/python3 will show what it's pointing to.
To my knowledge, OSX doesn't have anything installed natively in /usr/local/opt/ without homebrew.
Also, OSX doesn't come with python3.
