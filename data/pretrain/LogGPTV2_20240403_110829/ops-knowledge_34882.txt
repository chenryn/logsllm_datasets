User: Anyone have any thoughts on how/if it is possible to integrate Google Code commits to cause a Google AppEngine deployment of the most recent code?
I have a simple Google AppEngine project's source hosted on Google Code and would love if everytime I committed to Subversion, that AppEngine would reflect the latest commit.  I don't mind if things are broken on the live site since the project is for personal use mainly and for learning.
Anyone have any thoughts on how to tie into the subversion commit for the Code repository and/or how to kickoff the deployment to AppEngine? Ideally the solution would not require anything manual from me nor any type of server/listener software on my machine.
Assistant: Very interesting, but not yet possible, AFAIK.  I have been looking for that option in Google Code with no success.
The only solution I can figure out is to install something in your machine that checks for changes in your SVN repository.
I'll be happy to hear about other approaches.
