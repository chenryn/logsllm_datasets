**Inquiry:**

Is it possible to integrate Google Code commits to trigger an automatic deployment of the most recent code to Google App Engine?

I have a simple Google App Engine project, and its source code is hosted on Google Code. I would like the project to automatically deploy the latest commit to App Engine every time I push changes to the Subversion (SVN) repository. Since this project is primarily for personal use and learning, I am not concerned if the live site occasionally experiences issues.

Does anyone have any suggestions on how to link the SVN commit in the Google Code repository to the deployment process on App Engine? Ideally, the solution should be fully automated and not require any manual intervention or additional server/listener software on my local machine.

**Response:**

This is an interesting question, but to my knowledge, such functionality is not natively supported by Google Code. I have also been searching for a similar option without success.

The only viable solution I can think of involves setting up a continuous integration (CI) tool on your local machine or a remote server. This CI tool would monitor the SVN repository for changes and automatically trigger the deployment to App Engine when a new commit is detected.

If there are other approaches or tools that could achieve this, I would be very interested to hear about them.
