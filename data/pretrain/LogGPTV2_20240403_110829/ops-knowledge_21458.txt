Question: "An application developer argues that setting the SameSite attribute of cookies to 'Lax' provides the best balance between security and user experience. Which of the following statements best counters this claim?"
 "A": "The 'Lax' setting can inadvertently allow cookies to be sent with some cross-site requests, potentially leading to information leakage."
 "B": "The 'Lax' setting is too restrictive and will prevent cookies from being sent on any third-party site requests, causing functionality issues."
 "C": "The 'Strict' setting is more balanced as it allows cookies to be sent with all requests, enhancing the user's navigation experience."
 "D": "The 'None' setting is the only option that fully protects against cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks."
Answer: A
