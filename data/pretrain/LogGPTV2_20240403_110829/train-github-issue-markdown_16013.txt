I am uncertain if the title clearly conveys the issue I am facing, which is related to the Neo4j spatial plugin (https://github.com/neo4j/spatial). When attempting to use Neo4j with this plugin entirely through Cypher and the HTTP REST API, it becomes impossible to set up an autoindex that automatically adds nodes with 'lat' and 'lon' properties to the appropriate index. As a result, these nodes will not be discovered when using a `withinDistance` query in Cypher. Consequently, after every `CREATE` Cypher statement, an additional call to the REST API is necessary to add the node to the correct index.

For a comprehensive example and a list of required actions, please refer to: https://gist.github.com/thomasfr/8103037

There is also a relevant discussion on the spatial plugin's GitHub page: neo4j-contrib/spatial#125

Is there a possibility to include more than one auto-indexing configuration in the `neo4j.properties` file, allowing for the definition of different index types based on node "types"? A node type could be determined either by its labels or simply by the presence of specific properties listed in `node_keys_indexable`.

Thank you.
