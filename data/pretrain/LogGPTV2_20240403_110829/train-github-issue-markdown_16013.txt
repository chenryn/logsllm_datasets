I am not sure if the title is clear enough. The reason for this issue for me
is the spatial plugin for neo4j (https://github.com/neo4j/spatial). If you
want to use neo4j with the spatial plugin completly via cypher and the rest
api over http, it is not possible to configure an autoindex which takes care
of adding node with 'lat' and 'lon' properties to the correct index. Without
adding the nodes to the correct index they will be not found when using cypher
with a `withinDistance` query. So after each `CREATE` cypher query on would
have to make an additional call to the REST API.  
See here for a complete example / list of actions:

There is also a related issue on the spatial plugin: neo4j-contrib/spatial#125
Is it possible to add more than one auto indexing configuration, with the
possibility to define the index type for different node "types", to the
neo4.properties file? A node type could be identified via their labels or
simply when the node has the configured properties in `node_keys_indexable`.
