ABSTRACT
BGP preﬁx hijacking is a serious security threat on the
Internet. In this paper we propose a region-based BGP
announcement ﬁltering scheme (RBF) to improve the
BGP security.
In contrast to existing solutions that
indiﬀerently prevent or detect preﬁx hijacking attacks,
RBF enables diﬀerentiated AS and preﬁx ﬁltering treat-
ment and blends preﬁx hijacking prevention with deter-
rence. RBF is a light-weight BGP security scheme that
provides strong incremental deployment incentive and
better preﬁx hijacking deterrence. Experimental studies
based on real Internet numbers allocation information
and BGP traces show that RBF is a feasible and eﬀec-
tive scheme in improving BGP security. For example,
on the days without known BGP preﬁx hijacking at-
tacks, only a small number of BGP announcements will
be ﬂagged as attacks.
Importantly, by applying RBF
to known BGP preﬁx hijacking attacks, we show that
RBF can detect and ﬁlter both large-scale and small-
scale BGP preﬁx hijacking attacks even if only a single
preﬁx is hijacked.

The Internet consists of tens of thousands of network
domains or Autonomous Systems (ASes), each of which
is a logical collection of networks under a common ad-
ministrative control [9]. ASes exchange the reachabil-
ity information of network preﬁxes via an inter-domain
routing protocol. The current inter-domain routing pro-
tocol is the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) [25, 28].
Despite the critical importance of BGP to the healthy
operation of the global Internet system, BGP is inher-
ently lack of security measures and is vulnerable to a
number of security attacks [19, 20], including the highly
publicized preﬁx hijacking attacks [3, 22, 26].
BGP preﬁx hijacking attacks take two broad forms:
origin spooﬁng and path spooﬁng. In origin spooﬁng,
an AS u originates a preﬁx (or a more speciﬁc preﬁx)
belonging to another AS v without proper authoriza-
tion from v.
In path spooﬁng, an AS u announces a
false route pretending to be en route to a preﬁx of AS
v.
In this case, the originating AS is still the preﬁx
owner v. In this paper we focus on addressing the ﬁrst
type of preﬁx hijacking, i.e., origin spooﬁng. (We brieﬂy
discuss how the scheme developed in this paper can be
extended to help address path-spooﬁng preﬁx hijacking
in Section 5.) Preﬁx hijacking may occur because of
either unintentional misconﬁguration or intentional ma-
licious attacks. To simplify the description we refer to
both as attacks.
Given the importance of addressing the preﬁx hijack-
ing problem to the global Internet security, many coun-
termeasures have been developed to improve the BGP
security, including both cryptographic [11, 16, 29, 30]
and non-cryptographic methods [8, 10, 14, 17, 18, 23,
27, 31]. However, none of them have been widely de-
ployed or adopted on the Internet, due to various rea-
sons including high cost, lack of (partial) deployment
incentives, and imprecise operational objectives, among
others. Overall, they all try to indiﬀerently prevent or
detect preﬁx hijacking attacks, viewing all ASes and IP
address preﬁxes equally. This indiﬀerent view makes it
challenging to incrementally deploy any BGP security
schemes on the Internet [5].
In this paper we take a fundamentally diﬀerent ap-
proach that provides diﬀerentiated AS and preﬁx treat-
ment, and that blends preﬁx hijacking prevention with
deterrence. We refer to this approach as region-based
BGP announcement ﬁltering (RBF). In RBF, the Inter-
net is partitioned into regions; an AS in a region cannot
89originate a preﬁx allocated to a diﬀerent region. Re-
gions can be deﬁned at diﬀerent granularity depending
on the security requirements of the ASes where RBF
is deployed. In the current paper, we consider two re-
gion granularities: country-level and Regional Internet
Registry (RIR) level [12]. The motivation behind RBF
is the following. ASes within the same region normally
have better communication channels, and more impor-
tantly, they are more likely to be within the same juris-
diction of law enforcement. By preventing preﬁx hijack-
ing across diﬀerent regions, we can conﬁne all potential
preﬁx hijacking attacks to the same region, where ASes
can quickly resolve preﬁx hijacking caused by miscon-
ﬁguration due to better communication channels, and
more importantly, potential malicious attacks can also
be largely deterred due to the explicit legal consequences
involved in hijacking preﬁxes belonging to ASes in the
same region.

centives and can be incrementally deployed by individ-
ual ASes or regions [5]. RBF also has a precise op-
erational objective of preventing cross-region preﬁx hi-
jacking attacks to provide better attack deterrence. In
this paper we present the design of RBF. We also eval-
uate the performance of RBF using the currently avail-
able AS and preﬁx allocation (in contrast to the vol-
untary registration) information maintained by RIRs.
Our studies show that, on the days without known BGP
preﬁx hijacking attacks, RBF will on average only ﬂag
215 AS and preﬁx pairs as attacks each day, with the
help of a small table to maintain the legacy cross-region
BGP announcements. That is, network operators only
need to examine a small number of potential hijacking
attacks each day. Importantly, using BGP trace with
known preﬁx hijacking attacks, we also show that RBF
can detect and ﬁlter both large-scale BGP preﬁx hi-
jacking attacks (where a large number of preﬁxes are
hijacked) and small-scale attacks (where only a few or
a single preﬁx is hijacked), should the attacks involve
ASes and preﬁxes in diﬀerent regions. Therefore, RBF
provides ASes and regions with the conﬁdence of what
BGP preﬁx hijacking attacks may occur and enables
them to respond to the attacks accordingly.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In
Section 2 we provide the necessary background on inter-
domain routing and numbers allocation and assignment
on the Internet. We present the design of the RBF archi-
tecture in Section 3. We perform experimental studies
using real BGP traces in Section 4. Section 5 brieﬂy dis-
cusses how RBF can be extended to handle path spoof-
ing attacks, and summarizes related work. We conclude
the paper in Section 6.
2. BACKGROUND
In this section we present the necessary background
on BGP that is most relevant to our work. We refer
interested readers to [25, 28] for a more complete de-
scription of BGP. In addition, we also describe the In-
ternet numbers allocation and assignment including AS
numbers and IP addresses.
2.1 Border Gateway Protocol
The Internet is a collection of tens of thousands of net-
work domains or Autonomous Systems (ASes). Each AS
has a unique AS number (ASN) and owns one or mul-
tiple IP address preﬁxes. ASes exchange network preﬁx
reachability information using an inter-domain routing
protocol, the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). BGP
has two types of route update messages—announcements
or withdrawals. A route withdrawal, containing a list of
network preﬁxes, indicates that the sender of the with-
drawal message can no longer reach the preﬁxes. In con-
trast, a route announcement indicates that the sender
knows of a path to a network preﬁx.
A BGP announcement message contains a list of route
attributes associated with the destination network pre-
ﬁx. One important route attribute is as path, the path
vector attribute that is the sequence of ASes (i.e., their
ASNs) that this route has been propagated over. We
will use r.as path to denote the as path attribute of
route r. Let r.as path = hvkvk−1 . . . v1v0i. The route
was originated (ﬁrst announced) by AS v0, which owns
the destination network preﬁx. Before arriving at AS
vk, the route was carried over ASes v1, v2, . . . , vk−1 in
that order.
In a small portion of BGP routes on the
Internet, an AS path as path contains a set of ASNs
as set, in which ASNs do not have the particular order
as discussed above. This is commonly caused by preﬁx
aggregation. We discuss how to handle as set in the
next section.
After learning a set of candidate routes from neigh-
bors, AS v selects a single best route to reach the des-
tination, based on some local route selection policy [6].
AS v then propagates the best route to its proper neigh-
bors, after prepending its own AS number to the route.
When the best route at AS v is withdrawn due to some
network failure event by the neighbor from where the
route is learned, AS v will choose an alternative best
route among the candidate routes and propagate the
new best route to the proper neighbors. Note that an AS
can only withdraw a previously announced BGP route.
Irrelevant BGP withdrawal updates will be ignored by
the receiving BGP routers. Therefore, from the view-
point of security, it is suﬃcient to monitor BGP route
announcements.
2.2 Internet Numbers Allocation and As-
signment
Internet numbers, including both ASNs and IP ad-
dresses, are managed and allocated in a hierarchical
fashion, coordinated by the Internet Assigned Numbers
Authority (IANA) [12]. Figure 1 illustrates the Internet
numbers allocation and assignment structure.
IANA
allocates numbers to the Regional Internet Registries
(RIRs). Currently there are ﬁve RIRs, namely, AfriNIC,
APNIC, ARIN, LACNIC, and RIPE NCC, which are
responsible for the allocation of numbers in diﬀerent re-
gions of the global world. RIRs allocate Internet num-
bers to Local Internet Registries (LIRs) and National
Internet Registries (NIRs). Internet Service Providers
(ISPs) obtain Internet numbers from LIRs or NIRs or di-
rectly from RIRs. Users normally obtain Internet num-
90vidual members and there is no formal and consistent
method to verify the correctness of the information [27].
For this reason we only rely on the Internet numbers
allocation information in our experimental studies; we
do not use any IRR registration information. RIRs have
been archiving the daily Internet numbers allocation ﬁle
using the above format since late 2003 [1].

signment structure.

bers from ISPs.
In Figure 1, CNNIC and AT&T are
example NIR and ISP, respectively. RIRs have well-
established procedures for their members to request new
Internet numbers.
Each RIR maintains a ﬁle of the Internet numbers
that are allocated to its corresponding members [1]. We
refer to this ﬁle as the numbers allocation ﬁle, or simply
allocation ﬁle when there is no confusion. This ﬁle is
updated and archived on a daily basis (midnight local
time) and mirrored by all the RIRs. This ﬁle contains
the most up-to-date Internet numbers allocation and
assignment information for the corresponding RIR, with
the following (partial) record format [2]:
registry|cc|type|start|value|date
where registry is one of the ﬁve RIRs, cc is the ISO 2-
letter country code. registry and cc specify which RIR
allocated the corresponding number and to which coun-
try the number was allocated or assigned, respectively.
type can be asn (for AS numbers), ipv4 (for IPv4 ad-
dresses), or ipv6. It speciﬁes the type of the record. In
this paper we ignore IPv6 addresses. start and value
speciﬁes the ﬁrst Internet number and the total count
of elements in the allocated range, respectively. For ex-
ample, if the record is for IP address allocation, start
will contain the ﬁrst IP address in the allocated range,
and value indicates the total number of IP addresses in
the range. Note that an allocated IP address range may
not be represented by a single preﬁx. For example, an
RIR may allocate a contiguous block of IP addresses to
an NIR but the block cannot be speciﬁed by any single
preﬁx. For this reason, we refer to an allocated IP ad-
dress range as an IP address block when we discuss the
IP address allocation from RIRs. date records the date
when the allocation or assignment was made.
From the Internet numbers allocation records main-
tained by RIRs, we can obtain the country and RIR-
level region to which an ASN and IP address block
were allocated. We note here that, ARIN also main-
tains the information of certain legacy ASNs and IP ad-
dress blocks that were allocated before RIRs were estab-
lished. A number of these legacy ASNs and IP address
blocks were allocated to countries that are not within
the region of ARIN. We further note that although the
allocation records are updated daily by all the RIRs,
the ﬁle may contain outdated information. However,
it is more accurate and complete than the voluntary
registration information maintained by Internet Rout-
ing Registries (IRRs) [13], commonly known as whois
databases, where the information is supplied by indi-
In this section we ﬁrst present a high-level overview
of the region-based BGP announcement ﬁltering (RBF)
without considering practical deployment issues, for ex-
ample, how an RBF-enabled BGP router obtains the
ASN and IP address allocation information. The ob-
jective of this high-level overview is to illustrate how
