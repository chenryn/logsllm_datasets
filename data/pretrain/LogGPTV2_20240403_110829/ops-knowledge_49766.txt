User: How to implement network communication between containers in Docker?
Assistant: In Docker, network mode can be used to realize network communication between containers. The following are several common network modes: 1. Bridge mode: the default mode, using Docker's built-in virtual bridge to connect all containers to the same network. 2. Host mode: The container uses the actual network interface of the host and shares the IP address and port number with the host, which can improve network performance, but may cause security problems. 3. Overlay mode: used for cross-host container communication, which can communicate with containers in a multi-host network created on multiple Docker hosts, and connect each node through a VXLAN overlay network. 4. None mode: The container has no network interface, and network communication can only be performed by adding an additional network mode or manually configuring the container network interface. Regardless of the mode, you can use the docker network command to create and manage networks. For example, use the following command to create a custom Bridge network: ``` docker network create my_net ``` Then, when running a container, you can use the following command to connect the container to the network: ``` docker run -- rm -it --network my_net ubuntu /bin/bash ``` Among them, the --network parameter specifies the network to be connected, Ubuntu indicates what image to use to start the container, and /bin/bash is the command to run. After running successfully, you can ping the IP addresses of other containers in the container for network communication between containers.
