reduce the cryptographic overhead induced by the process-
ing of all messages.
3.2 Threat Model
We assume that an adversary A aims to track the location
of mobile nodes. We consider that A can have the same cre-
dentials as mobile nodes and is equipped to eavesdrop com-
munications. In practice, the adversary can thus be a rogue
individual, be a set of malicious mobile nodes, or may even
deploy its own infrastructure by placing eavesdropping de-
vices in the network. In the worst case, A obtains complete
coverage and tracks nodes throughout the entire network.
We characterize the latter type of adversary as global.
A collects identifying information (i.e., pseudonyms) from
the entire network and obtains location traces that allow him
to track the location of mobile nodes. Hence, the problem
we tackle in this paper consists in protecting the location
privacy of mobile nodes, that is, in preventing other parties
from learning a node’s past and current location [7]. Finally,
we assume that the key-pair generation and distribution pro-
cess cannot be altered or controlled by the adversary.
4. USER-CENTRIC LOCATION PRIVACY
In this section, we evaluate the amount of location pri-
vacy provided by the use of multiple pseudonyms. We then
propose a user-centric model of location privacy to capture
the location privacy of a node over time.
3264.1 Location Privacy
There are several techniques to mitigate the tracking of
mobile nodes, as discussed in the related work Section. In
this paper, we consider the use of multiple pseudonyms: over
time, mobile nodes change the pseudonym to sign messages,
thus reducing their long term linkability. To avoid spatial
correlation of their location, mobile nodes in proximity co-
ordinate pseudonym changes in regions called mix zones. In
order to thwart Sybil attacks, we assume that as soon as a
node changes pseudonyms, the old pseudonym expires and is
removed from the node’s memory. Mix zones can also con-
ceal the trajectory of mobile nodes to protect against the
spatial correlation of location traces, e.g., by using (i) silent
mix zones [36, 43], (ii) a mobile proxy [50], or (iii) regions
where the adversary has no coverage [9]. Without loss of
generality, we assume silent mix zones: mobile nodes turn
oﬀ their transceivers and stop sending messages for a certain
period of time. If at least two nodes changing pseudonyms in
a silent mix zone, a mixing of their whereabouts occurs and
the mix zone becomes a confusion point for the adversary.
Consider a mobile network composed of N mobile nodes.
At time t, a group of n(t) mobile nodes are in proximity.
One node among the n(t) nodes can initiate the pseudonym
change using the one-round protocol suggested in [43] (i.e.,
the Swing protocol): a mobile node broadcasts an initiation
message to start the pseudonym change. The n(t)−1 mobile
nodes in proximity receive the message and enter a silent
period during which they decide whether to change their
pseudonyms or not. During the silent period, nodes cannot
observe each other messages. At the end of the silent period,
it appears that all pseudonym changes occur simultaneously.
Mobile nodes must thus decide to change pseudonyms with-
out knowing the decision of other nodes in proximity.
The adversary A observes the set of n(T ) nodes changing
pseudonyms, where T is the time at which the pseudonym
change occurs. A compares the set B of pseudonyms before
the change with the set D of pseudonyms after the change
and, based on the mobility of the nodes, predicts the most
probable matching [7, 43]. Let pd|b = P r(“Pseudonym d ∈
D corresponds to b ∈ B”), that is the probability that a new
pseudonym d ∈ D corresponds to an old pseudonym b ∈ B.
As is standard in the literature [52], the uncertainty of the
adversary, and thus for our purposes the location privacy
level of node i involved in a successful pseudonym change at
time T , is:
Ai(T ) = − n(T )X
pd|b log2(pd|b)
(1)
d=1
The achievable location privacy depends on both the number
of nodes n(T ) and the unpredictability of their whereabouts
in the mix zone pd|b. If a node i is the only one to change its
pseudonym, then its identity is known to the adversary and
its location privacy level is deﬁned to be Ai(T ) = 0. The
entropy is maximum for a uniform probability distribution
pd|b, which would provide node i with a location privacy
level of log2(n(T )). This can be achieved, for example, after
a coordinated pseudonym change by all players. We denote
T (cid:96)
i the time of the last successful pseudonym change of node
i, i.e. when at least one other node changed its pseudonym.
4.2 User-Centric Model
The entropy metric evaluates the location privacy achieved
Figure 1: Location privacy loss function βi(t, T (cid:96)
i ). At
t1, node i changes pseudonym and updates its time
of last successful pseudonym change: T (cid:96)
:= t1. The
i
function β(t, T (cid:96)
i ) increases according to the user sen-
sitivity λ and estimates the time at which mobile i
becomes unsatisﬁed with its location privacy (T f
i ).
At t2, node i changes pseudonym again and updates
T (cid:96)
i := t2.
in mix zones of the network. However, the location privacy
needs of individual users vary depending on time and loca-
tion. It is thus desirable to protect the location privacy in
a user-centric manner, such that each user can decide when
and where to protect its location privacy. Hence, we con-
sider a user-centric model of location privacy. User-centric
location privacy [33, 35, 43] is a distributed approach where
each mobile node locally monitors its location privacy level
over time. The user centric approach is easily scalable and
permits a more ﬁne-grained approach to maintaining loca-
tion privacy. Each mobile node can evaluate the distance
over which it is potentially tracked by an adversary (i.e., the
distance-to-confusion [33]) and can act upon it by deciding
whether and when to change its pseudonym. Whereas, a
network wide metric measures average location privacy and
might ignore that some nodes have a low location privacy
level and are traceable for long distances.
With a user-centric model, mobile nodes can request a
pseudonym change from other nodes in proximity when their
local location privacy level is lower than a desired level.
Nodes in proximity will then choose to cooperate when their
location privacy level is low as well. The drawback of the
user-centric model is that nodes may have misaligned incen-
tives (i.e., diﬀerent privacy levels) and this can lead to failed
attempts to achieve location privacy.
In this work, we formalize this problem and introduce a
user-centric location privacy model to capture the evolu-
tion of user-centric location privacy level over time. The
user-centric location privacy level of each mobile node i
is modeled via a location privacy loss function βi(t, T (cid:96)
i ) :
i ≤ t is
(R+, R+) → R+ where t is the current time and T (cid:96)
the time of the last successful pseudonym change of mobile
i. The maximum value of βi(t, T (cid:96)
i ) equals the level of loca-
tion privacy achieved at the last pseudonym change. The
privacy loss is initially zero and increases with time accord-
ing to a sensitivity parameter, 0  1. We assume
that each node knows the number of other nodes in the mix
zone. To achieve a consensus on this number, each node can
adopt a neighbor discovery protocol [55].
• Strategy: Each player has two moves si: Cooperate (C)
or Defect (D). By cooperating, a mobile node changes its
pseudonym. The set of strategies of node i is thus Si =
{C, D} and the set of strategies in the game is S = {Si}n(t)
i=1 .
