There are cases where PersistenceAnnotationBeanPostProcessor doesn't find lazy
loaded EMFs. I think it's because in findNamedEntityManagerFactory it uses
beanFactory.isTypeMatch() to find EMFs that implement EntityManagerFactoryInfo
and isTypeMatch() only matches cached singletons.
This is probably a known limitation so it may only require a documentation
mention in PersistenceAnnotationBeanPostProcessor.
For anyone experiencing this problem the solution is to just make your EMF non
lazy.
