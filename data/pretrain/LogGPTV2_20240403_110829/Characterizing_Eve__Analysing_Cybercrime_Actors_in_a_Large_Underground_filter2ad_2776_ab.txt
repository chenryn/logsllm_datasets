Precision measures the fraction of actual questions retrieved among the total
of questions retrieved (including false positives). Recall, or sensitivity, measures
the fraction of questions retrieved among the total number of actual questions
in the dataset. Finally, the F1 score combines in a single measure both precision
and recall. Our classiﬁer has Precision = 0.88, Recall = 0.85 and F1 = 0.86. While
these metrics can be improved, the classiﬁer is accurate enough to automatically
identify question threads, a task which would otherwise be infeasible due to the
size of the dataset.
4.2 Social Network Analysis
We designed and developed SNA tools to facilitate study of the forums at dif-
ferent levels of granularity, per board, per topic of interest, per year, etc. We
build the social network by processing the public interactions of the members.
This network is represented as a directed graph, where nodes are the members
of the forum and edges their interactions. We deﬁne a directed edge from node
V to node W if there is a reply from V to W. There are two possible forms of
reply: (a) when V explicitly cites a post made by W; and (b) when V replies in
a thread initiated by W. When available, we use information from reputation
votes given between members to classify the interactions as positive, negative or
neutral.
We use classical SNA metrics such as centrality degrees to analyse the net-
work, i.e. in-degree (fraction of nodes its incoming edges are connected to), out-
degree (fraction of nodes its outgoing edges are connected to), and eigenvector
(measure of the inﬂuence of a node in a network). Additionally, we compute the
following metrics to measure the popularity of the forum users: total number
of replies; h-index (a member with h-index = n is author of n threads having at
least n replies); and the i-10-index, i-50-index and i-100-index (i.e. the number
of threads with at least 10, 50 and 100 replies respectively). These metrics are
used in academia to measure the productivity and impact of a scholar. We adopt
them to analyse underground forums for the same purpose.
We also developed tools to analyse the interests of forum members. This
allows us to study the networks of actors interested in particular topics. Interests
can be calculated for a given period, so we can analyse the evolution of diﬀerent
actors (e.g. a member initially interested in gaming related boards who then
moved to hacking related boards). The interest of a member M in a board B is
calculated as:
I(M, B) = NT(M, B) ∗ 3 + NP(M, B)
Where N{T,P}(M, B) denotes the number of {threads, posts} written by M
in B. We assign triple weight to threads since initiating a thread represents a
greater interest than posting a reply.

4.3 Machine Learning - Clustering
Machine learning techniques can be applied to extract common characteristics
from a dataset. We apply k-means clustering to group the actors based on their
activity [17]. K-means partitions a set of n samples into k clusters (with k << n).
We extract a set of 44 features for each actor, which can be classiﬁed as measures
relating to forum activity, social relations, and reputation measures.
Measures relating to forum activity includes the number of days
between the ﬁrst and last post, the number of posts and threads in each category
and the number of posts and threads in the currency exchange board. We explic-
itly include the currency exchange board (which is part of the marketplace) as
it characterizes the ﬁnancial activities of the actors.
Network centrality measures are obtained from SNA. These include out-
degree, in-degree, eigenvector, h-index, and i-10 and i-100 indices.
Reputation measures are taken from the reputation systems used on the
forum. These include the overall reputation bestowed and prestige scores (pres-
tige is an forum metric based on activity). There are also counts for the number
of positive, negative, and zero-value reputation votes each account received.
Then, using the feature set we perform clustering using k-means. After apply-
ing the Elbow method [35] to analyse the within-group sum of squares for various
values of k, we set k = 5.
4.4 Results
Using the tools described above, we ﬁrst analyse the social relations estab-
lished between key actors and their closest neighbours. Second, we analyse their
common characteristics by splitting them into groups using k-means clustering.
Finally, we analyse their pathways by looking for changes in their interests and
the number of questions posted as they spend more time in the forum.
Social Relations. Figure 1 shows the social network involving the key actors.3
The actors identiﬁed from media sources and Flashpoint are ﬁlled in red, the
ones identiﬁed from network analysis are orange and the those linked to mal-
ware distribution are blue. Colours of the edges represent the sentiment of the
relationship, calculated from the reputation votes sent to each other. Most key
actors are closely connected to each other, and most relationships are positive.
Actors obtained from diﬀerent sources are closely or even directly connected. For
example, the detail in Fig. 1 shows a member identiﬁed as malware distributor
(in blue) which is directly connected to one identiﬁed through SNA (in orange)
and very close to at least two actors identiﬁed from media sources (in red).
Some close neighbours (for example, the nodes tagged as ‘Bridge’ in the detail
from Fig. 1) are connected to more than one key actor, and act as ‘bridges’ for
connecting diﬀerent groups. These actors are of interest since they might be

Characterization. Table 1 shows the average values for each of the ﬁve clusters
obtained by k-means. There is a small group of 5 actors who have the highest
measures of forum activity, are highly reputed (though they also receive high
negative votes), and have rich social relations. These 5 actors are popular (due
to the high values of their H and i indexes), have inﬂuence in the network, and
are well known in the community. The remaining clusters have also been active
216
S. Pastrana et al.
for long time (more than 2 years) but diﬀer in quantity of posts and threads.
The clusters are also diﬀerentiated by their areas of interests.
The cluster with 20 actors is most interested in the market section (followed
by the common section). They are the most active group in currency exchange
and have high social relationship measurements (e.g. on average they have 7.2
threads with more than 100 replies). Overall, actors in this cluster are likely to
be known in the community as proliﬁc market traders.
The clusters with 27 and 37 members have similar interests (mostly in market
and hacking, but also in common and coding categories), though one has higher
reputation (mostly positive) and social relations (e.g. they have more than twice
the number of threads with at least 10 replies). Finally, the least active cluster,
which is composed of 24 actors, is interested ﬁrstly in hacking and then in the
market sections, with negligible posts in currency exchange.
Overall, cluster analysis suggests key actors are mostly characterized by their
interest in the market, common, and hacking areas. Also, they can be grouped
by their forum activity, with some being more active and popular, and thus well
known within the community, while others are less active, do not participate in
the common sections of the forum and are less popular.
Evolution. We track the interests of the actors since they were registered until
their last visit (if enabled on their proﬁle) or last post. We compute their interests
in each board and then aggregate them per category and per year. To analyse
temporal evolution, we measure the interests at the beginning, middle and end
of the period each actor has been active. The beginning is deﬁned as the year
of their ﬁrst post, the end is the year of their last post, and the middle is the
period in between. We then calculate the evolution of interests between these
periods by computing transitions of interest. Concretely, a transition of interest
from a category Ci in time t0 to a category Cj in time t1 is calculated as:
T (C t0
i → C t1
j ) =
(|St0| − βt0
i ) ∗ λt0
i + (|St1| − βt1
j ) ∗ λt1
j
(cid:2)
∀A∈K
Where K is the set of all the key actors, Stn denotes the set of all categories
of interest for actor A in time tn, λtn
i denotes the normalized interest of actor A
in category Ci in time tn, and βtn
is the relative position of category i regarding
i
the ordered list of categories by score in time tn (i.e., the top category has βt
i
equal to 1, the second equal to 2 and so on). The above equation weights the
categories of interest per actor according to the amount of posts and threads
posted in each category with respect to the rest.
Figure 2 shows the aggregated transitions for all key actors. Overall, actors
are most interested in the hacking, market, and common categories. Over their
time in the forum, there is a slight increase of interest in the coding and tech-
nology sections, and a decrease in the gaming sections. From this ﬁgure we
can draw several conclusions. First, in general actors are active participants in
non-criminal related boards, such as those from the common category. This sug-
gests their criminal activity runs in parallel or comes after other interests (e.g.

entertainment or gaming), and they are involved in other activities within the
community. Second, their high interest in the marketplace and money sections
indicates they may have ﬁnancial motivations. Third, as they get older and more
experienced in the forum they are less likely to engage in gaming boards.
Prior research has found forums are used for sharing information and learning
about cybercrime and deviant activities [10,15,38]. Thus, we analyse the evolu-
tion of the actors in terms of the number of questions (or requests for informa-
tion) posted across time. In order to track evolution, this analysis includes the
34 key actors who have been posting for at least 4 years. We count the number
of posts and number of questions posted for each year since they wrote their ﬁrst
post.
Figure 3 shows the proportion of questions posted per year with respect to
the total number of questions posted. Each row represents a diﬀerent actor (the
top row shows the aggregation of the 34 actors). Most actors posted more than
half of all their questions during their ﬁrst or second year of activity in the
forum. However, there are other actors (e.g. A1, A2, and A3) that keep posting
questions at a similar rate after 5 or 6 years of activity. We can conﬁrm these
actors posted more questions in the early stages of their activity in the forums.
5 Predicting Key Actors
We analyse over a decade of data from Hackforums to identify those variables
relating to forum activity that predict the likelihood a user will eventually be
an actor of interest to law enforcement. Actors were selected for inclusion if
they had been active since 2009, and had made more than ﬁve posts on the
forum. This way, we do not consider old and low proﬁle actors which would
otherwise introduce noise in our analysis. After the forum administrator was

excluded from the dataset, there were 245,636 cases extracted.4 Our prediction
framework is based on two steps: using multiple approaches to select potential
key actors based on their forum activity, and predicting which of these are key
actors based on the key terms used in their posts. We ﬁrst combine the outputs
from a logistic regression model, k-means clustering and SNA to identify actors
that are potentially involved in criminal activity. Second, we use topic analysis
to conﬁrm whether these users are engaged in cybercrime related activity, such
as trading in illegal goods and services.
5.1 Logistic Regression
We analyse the data applying backward stepwise logistic regression, using the
likelihood ratio method. This method starts with a model which includes every
independent variable, gradually removing every variable which does not have
a signiﬁcant impact on the dependent variable. Field [9] justiﬁes the use of
stepwise methods when carrying out exploratory research, in which there is no
previous research on which to base hypotheses for testing, as well as situations
in which causality is not of interest, but rather a model to ﬁt the data. Both
these justiﬁcations apply for this research. Field also recommends that if stepwise
methods are to be used, then the backward method is the better option, as the

forward method has a higher risk of Type II (false negative) errors. Logistic
regression is often used in medical research, for example, to identify the risk
factors associated with a disease within the wider population.
Logistic regression models predict a categorical outcome, in this case key
actor status. Measures of forum activity, network centrality measures, and rep-
