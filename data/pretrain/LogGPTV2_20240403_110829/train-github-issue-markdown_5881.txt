**Current behavior**  
When using CommonJS (or ES2015 modules), the order of imports matters when
importing an AngularJS app to bootstrap. Here is an example Plunkr that
demonstrates the problem: https://plnkr.co/edit/lKE6a3sPqjMWvoWJF9oT?p=preview
But basically:
When AngularJS lives in: `app.js` like this one:
    import * as angular from 'angular';
    export default angular.module('app', [])
      .run(function() { console.log('Angular 1 is running!')})
and Angular lives in `main.ts` like this one:
    import 'core-js/es7/reflect';
    import 'zone.js';
    import { platformBrowserDynamic } from '@angular/platform-browser-dynamic';
    import { UpgradeModule } from '@angular/upgrade/static';
    import { AppModule } from './app.module';
    import app from '../app/app';
    const platform = platformBrowserDynamic();
    platform.bootstrapModule(AppModule).then(platformRef => {
      const upgrade = platformRef.injector.get(UpgradeModule) as UpgradeModule;
      upgrade.bootstrap(document.body, [app.name], { strictDi: true})
    })
The bootstrap will fail with:
    Unhandled Promise rejection: AngularJS v1.x is not loaded! ; Zone:  ; Task: Promise.then ; Value: Error: AngularJS v1.x is not loaded!
However, moving `import app from './app'` before `zone.js` import, the
bootstrap will work
**Expected behavior**  
Importing an AngularJS app should work after the main dependency imports like
`zone.js` and `reflect` and other libraries.
