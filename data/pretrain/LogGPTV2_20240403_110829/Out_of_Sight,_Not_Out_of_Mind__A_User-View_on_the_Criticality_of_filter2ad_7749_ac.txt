with nearly a quarter of all resources (22.98%), on average,
hosted on the other side of a submarine cable (maximum is
43.62%, South Africa).
Thus far, our analysis has focused on the criticality of
the SCN on a per-country basis. The degree of criticality
when focusing on end users, however, is in part a function
of the fraction of its Internet population. For example, while
Indonesia and Taiwan have similar SCN path hit rates (53.73%
4The minimum hit rate is 15.19% corresponding to Japan.
Perhaps most surprisingly, we find that Landlocked coun-
tries, despite not having any part of their territory connected
to an ocean or sea, still have an average of 16.25% reliance
on the SCN.
To better understand how Landlocked countries access the
SCN, we obtain a country-level route (§3) for the SCN paths
to popular resources from these countries. Figure 2 shows
a Sankey diagram summarizing how Landlocked countries
in our dataset rely on neighboring countries to reach the
SCN. On average, these countries use 4 neighboring coun-
tries (with the exception of Belarus, which routes traffic via
7 different countries), and do so with a clearly preferred
neighbor (> 40% of their SCN paths). Of the countries in this
subset (all of them in Europe), Germany, the United Kingdom,
France and the Netherlands are the most frequently chosen
countries for routing. These four countries are also host to
some of the largest European IXPs – DE-CIX, AMS-IX, LINX
and France-IX.

locked countries (left) to access the SCN.

and 50.77%, respectively), Indonesia has a 62.6% Internet
penetration rate, much lower than Taiwan’s 92.6%.
To account for this, the second set of boxes in Fig. 1 shows
the percentage of SCN path hits weighted by the respective
country’s Internet penetration. In the previous example, the
reliance on the SCN is adjusted to 33.64% for Indonesia and
47.02% for Taiwan.
Our initial analysis of criticality also ignores the degree
of redundancy in the SCN infrastructure available to a given
country. While two countries may show comparable reliance
on the SCN, one with greater redundancy should be less
affected by any single cable failure. To account for this, we
weight the percentage of popular resources retrieved via the
SCN by the number of cables and by the set of bundles avail-
able, yielding two values of criticality index. Figure 3 presents
box plots for each country category. Using the number of
cables as weight can be seen as a best case analysis, as it
assumes that all cables are interchangeable. Weighting by
bundles, on the other hand, offers a more realistic view of
criticality, considering that only cables in the same bundle, as
determined by the SoL test (Listing 1), provide redundancy.
The criticality index ranges between 0 and 100, with 100
meaning that the country retrieves all resources over the
SCN and has only one cable or bundle connecting it. The
largest observed criticality index corresponds to Argentina,
with a 30.02% hit ratio and reliance on 7 cables and 4 bundles.

It is interesting to compare Figs. 1 and 3; while Landlocked
countries are expected to be less dependent on the SCN than
Island countries, they also tend to have less redundancy. As
such, their weighted criticalities are comparable.
5.2 Benefit of CDN
One would assume that the potential added delay incurred
by traversing a submarine cable would motivate content
providers and CDNs to host resources (in particular, popular
ones) on nearby servers, and in the process avoid the poten-
tial risks of SCN failures. To understand the extent to which
this holds, we look at the fraction of CDN resources hosted
in replicas reached via submarine cables.
Figure 4: SCN path hit rates for CDN-hosted resources
for each geographic category.
For the CDNs detected in our dataset,5 Fig. 4 summarizes
the SCN path hit ratios of CDN-hosted resources for coun-
tries in each geographic class. Across all countries in our
dataset, an average of 28.22% of requests to CDN-hosted
resources hit a SCN path. In some instances (Cyprus), we
find as many as 65.1% of all requests for CDN-ized content
relying on the SCN!
Of the three classes of countries, the group most clearly
benefiting from nearby CDN replicas is the Landlocked group,
with an average SCN path hit ratio of 21.95% (as a point of
reference, the average SCN path hit ratio for its non CDN-
hosted content is 8.48%). North Macedonia is the outlier in
this class, with its SCN hit rate for CDN-ized content reach-
ing 37.73%. While this hit rate for CDN-hosted content is
lower than those of countries in the other two categories, it
is still significant.
This finding challenges our own assumptions that the ex-
pansion of CDN deployments could reduce the criticality of
the SCN for end users. There are a number of plausible expla-
nations for this, including the fact that although they have
large and growing infrastructures, the majority of CDNs
adopt a bringing-ISPs-home type of deployment [27], imply-
ing longer routes to content and higher chances of traversing
a submarine cable.
5The CDN detection tool used may not capture all CDN-hosted resources.
There may be more resources hosted on CDN’s in our dataset.
Figure 5: Fraction of websites with index page request
relying on the SCN.
5.3 Landing Pages Across the Ocean
The ability to retrieve a website’s landing page (index), the
first resource to be requested when visiting a web page –
and to do so in a timely manner – is critical when browsing
the web. If a site’s landing page is hosted across the SCN,
then an end user’s ability to load the page would be directly
affected by any SCN disruption.
Figure 5 shows the percentage of sites for which the land-
ing page was retrieved via a SCN path for each geographic
class. Surprisingly, an average 22.85% of websites for all coun-
tries in our dataset hit a SCN path during retrieval (≈37%,
14%, and 22%, on average, for Island, Landlocked and Other
countries, respectively).
6 CONCLUSIONS
While the submarine cable network is generally recognized
as critical infrastructure, we lack a clear understanding of the
extent of its criticality from the perspective of end users. We
presented a general methodology for analyzing the reliance
on the SCN of a given region, and applied it to 63 countries
from every continent, focusing on the most popular web
resources accessed by users in those regions. Our results
show that, contrary to popular belief, users rely on the SCN
to access a significant fraction of popular web resources,
across countries. Despite the explosive growth of data center
and CDN infrastructure around the world, we found that on
average, at least 28.22% of the CDN-hosted resources hit a
submarine cable, with that figure as high as 65.1% for some
countries. These findings make the case for further analysis
of the criticality of this network infrastructure for end users.
