User: Please provide a solution for remote file transfer on the Linux system, which requires encrypted transmission and supports resumable uploads.
Assistant: You can use the rsync command to implement remote file transfers, and rsync supports encrypted transfers (using SSH) and resumable uploads. Here is an example command for remote file transfer using rsync: ``` rsync -avz --partial --progress -e "ssh -p <ssh_port> -i <private_key>" <local_path> <remote_user>@<remote_host>: <remote_path> ``` Among them, the `-a` parameter means to retain file attributes during transmission, `-v` means to use verbose output, `-z` means to enable compression during transmission, and `--partial` means to support breakpoint resume , `--progress` means to display the progress of the transfer. The `-e` parameter is used to specify the SSH port number and private key file path. `<local_path>` and `<remote_path>` in the example represent the local file path and remote file path respectively, `<remote_user>` and `<remote_host>` represent the remote login user and host name. You need to replace these parameters with actual values, and then execute this command to realize remote file transfer.
