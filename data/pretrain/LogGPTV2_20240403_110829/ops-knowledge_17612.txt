User: I'm new to python and fabric api. I'm trying to use the sudo functionality to run a sed command in bash terminal which insert some text after a particular line of text is found. Some of the text I'm trying to insert into the file I'm modifying contains backslashes which seem to either be ignored by fabric or cause syntax errors. I've tried "shell=true" and "shell=false" options but still no luck. How can I escape the backslash? It seems "shell=true" only escapes $ and ". My Code below.
sudo (' sed -i "/sometext/a textwith\backslash" /home/me/somefile.txt',shell=True)
Assistant: OK, finally worked this out. RocketDonkey was correct. Needed to prefix with "r" but also needed to set "shell=False". This allowed what ever worked directly in the bash terminal to work when being called from fabric.api. 
Thanks RocketDonkey!!
