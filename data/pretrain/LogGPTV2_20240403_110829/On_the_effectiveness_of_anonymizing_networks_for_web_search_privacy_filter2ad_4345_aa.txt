## Abstract
Web search has become one of the most critical applications on the internet, with multiple search engines available to users. These search engines commonly log and analyze user queries, leading to significant privacy concerns. One well-known solution to enhance search privacy is to issue queries through anonymizing networks like Tor, thereby concealing the user's identity from the search engine. However, this approach still reveals the user queries, albeit mixed with those of other anonymization service users.

In this paper, we investigate the problem of identifying a user of interest (UOI) within a pool of queries received by a search engine over an anonymizing network. We demonstrate that an adversarial search engine can extract UOI queries using only a short-term user search query history and off-the-shelf machine learning classifiers. Specifically, by treating 60 users from publicly available AOL search logs as UOIs, we show that their queries can be identified with an average accuracy of 25.95% when mixed with queries from 99 other users, and 18.95% when mixed with queries from 999 other users. Although these average accuracies are not high, some UOIs could be identified with up to 80-98% accuracy even when their queries are mixed with those of 999 other users. Our results cast serious doubts on the effectiveness of anonymizing web search queries via anonymizing networks.

### Introduction
The World Wide Web hosts an enormous amount and variety of data, making efficient search and retrieval crucial. Multiple search engines are available to users, and to improve their search results, these engines log and analyze user queries. This practice has raised significant privacy concerns, as it can lead to both explicit and implicit privacy breaches. Explicit breaches occur due to the information embedded in the queries, such as searches for personal medical conditions or social security numbers. Implicit breaches arise when sensitive information is inferred through aggregation and profiling techniques, such as inferring a user's income level based on the brands they frequently search for.

Several solutions have been proposed to address these privacy issues. One class involves private information retrieval (PIR) protocols, which, while theoretically sound, are impractical due to high communication and computation overheads. Another class involves query obfuscation, where noisy queries are injected into the stream of real queries. However, recent research has shown that such methods can be vulnerable, as adversarial search engines can distinguish between real and obfuscation queries with high accuracy.

A third class of solutions involves using third-party infrastructure like single proxies or anonymizing networks. Single proxies require trust in a third party, whereas anonymizing networks, such as Tor, provide better protection and fault tolerance. Tor uses onion routing to route queries through a series of distributed relay servers, potentially hiding the query's source from the search engine. However, the fundamental drawback is that the search query must reach the search engine in clear text format, making it possible for the search engine to identify the user.

Our Contributions
- **Goal**: Analyze the effectiveness of anonymizing networks in preserving users' privacy against an adversarial search engine.
- **Observation**: Queries issued over Tor are "mixed" with those of other users, but the content itself is still visible to the search engine.
- **Question**: Can an adversarial search engine associate queries coming out of Tor exit nodes with the users who issued them?

We use machine learning techniques to show that user queries can be identified with reasonable accuracy, even when mixed with those of many other users. Specifically, by treating 60 users from the AOL search logs as users of interest, we demonstrate that their queries can be identified with an average accuracy of 25.95% when mixed with 99 other users, and 18.95% when mixed with 999 other users. For some users, the accuracy reaches up to 80-98%, even when mixed with 999 other users. These results cast serious doubt on the effectiveness of anonymizing web search queries via anonymizing networks.

### Problem Formulation and Study Methodology
We investigate whether an adversarial search engine can associate queries coming out of Tor exit nodes with the users who issued them. We assume the search engine does not use any accompanying information, such as IP addresses or cookies, and only analyzes the query content. We use the publicly available AOL search logs, which span three months, to simulate real user queries. We model the identification problem as a multiclass classification problem in machine learning, where the classifier is trained on the prior search history of Tor users and then used to classify the mixed queries.

### Conclusion
Our study shows that anonymizing networks like Tor may not provide the level of privacy expected, as an adversarial search engine can still identify user queries with reasonable accuracy. This highlights the need for more robust privacy-preserving techniques in web search.
