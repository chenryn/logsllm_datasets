Question: Your organization is considering the implementation of a host-based intrusion detection system (HIDS) to enhance its network security posture. While evaluating this option, you need to consider the strengths and weaknesses of HIDS as compared to network-based intrusion detection systems (NIDS). Which of the following statements accurately reflect the considerations you should take into account?
"A": "HIDS can view decrypted HTTPS traffic at the end host, while NIDS might not be able to inspect this encrypted traffic.",
"B": "A single HIDS can be deployed to defend against intrusions across the entire network, reducing the overall cost and complexity of the deployment.",
"C": "HIDS eliminates all evasion attacks, such as path traversal attacks, by understanding the contents of end requests and the file system's interpretation.",
"D": "HIDS must be installed on each machine requiring protection, potentially leading to higher costs and the need for differently-configured systems."
