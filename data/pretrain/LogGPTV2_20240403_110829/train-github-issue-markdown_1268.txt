Today, we agreed that the metadata for a single project should contain only relative paths. This is because there is no need to reference symbols originating from different node packages.

This decision is particularly important as we are about to change our package names. The string 'angular2' will no longer be used, but the metadata should remain unchanged since the .d.ts files will not be affected.

An example of the issues we are addressing can be found in the following file:
- [ng_control_name.metadata.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/angular/angular/builds-js/src/common/forms/directives/ng_control_name.metadata.json)

This file highlights two specific problems:

1. **Redundant Module Declaration:**
   - The top-level `__symbolic` definition includes a `module` field, which duplicates information already available in the file's path. This differs from `.d.ts` files, which do not declare their own module name.
   - **Proposal:** Remove the `module` field from the schema. (Refer to the schema definition: [schema.ts#L5](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/tools/metadata/src/schema.ts#L5))

2. **Absolute References:**
   - References to other Angular code use absolute names starting with 'angular2', which is not ideal.
   - **Proposal:** Use the `path.relative` function in Node.js to convert these references to relative paths based on the containing file.

@tbosch @chuckjaz, please review and provide your feedback on these proposals.
