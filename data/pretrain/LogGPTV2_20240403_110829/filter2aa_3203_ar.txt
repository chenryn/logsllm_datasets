Variable Length Subnetting 
Just as in IPv4, you can subnet IPv6 address prefixes recursively, up to the 64 bits that define the 
address prefix for an individual subnet, to provide route summarization at various levels of an 
organization intranet. Unlike IPv4, you cannot use variable-length subnetting to create different sized 
subnets because all IPv6 subnets use a 64-bit subnet prefix and a 64-bit interface ID.

Chapter Summary 
The key information in this chapter is the following: 
Subnetting is a set of techniques that you can use to efficiently allocate the address space of one or 
more unicast address prefixes among the subnets of an organization network. 
To determine the subnet prefix of an IPv4 address configuration in prefix length notation (w.x.y.z/n), 
retain the n high-order bits, set all the remaining bits to 0, and then convert the result to dotted decimal 
notation. To determine the subnet prefix of an IPv4 address configuration in subnet mask notation, 
perform a bit-wise logical AND between the IPv4 address and its subnet mask. 
When determining the number of host ID bits in an IPv4 address prefix to use for subnetting, choose 
more subnets over more hosts per subnet if you have more possible host IDs than are practical to use 
on a given subnet. 
To subnet an IPv4 address prefix, use either binary or decimal methods as described in this chapter to 
enumerate the subnetted address prefixes and the ranges of usable IPv4 addresses for each subnet. 
Variable length subnetting is a technique of creating subnetted IPv4 address prefixes that use prefix 
lengths of different sizes. 
To subnet an IPv6 global or unique local address prefix, use either hexadecimal or decimal methods as 
described in this chapter to enumerate the subnetted address prefixes.

IP Routing Overview 
IP routing is the process of forwarding a packet based on the destination IP address. Routing occurs at 
a sending TCP/IP host and at an IP router. In each case, the IP layer at the sending host or router must 
decide where to forward the packet. For IPv4, routers are also commonly referred to as gateways. 
To make these decisions, the IP layer consults a routing table stored in memory. Routing table entries 
are created by default when TCP/IP initializes, and entries can be added either manually or 
automatically. 
Direct and Indirect Delivery 
Forwarded IP packets use at least one of two types of delivery based on whether the IP packet is 
forwarded to the final destination or whether it is forwarded to an IP router. These two types of delivery 
are known as direct and indirect delivery. 
Direct delivery occurs when the IP node (either the sending host or an IP router) forwards a packet to 
the final destination on a directly attached subnet. The IP node encapsulates the IP datagram in a 
frame for the Network Interface layer. For a LAN technology such as Ethernet or Institute of Electrical 
and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) 802.11, the IP node addresses the frame to the destination’s media 
access control (MAC) address. 
Indirect delivery occurs when the IP node (either the sending host or an IP router) forwards a packet to 
an intermediate node (an IP router) because the final destination is not on a directly attached subnet. 
For a LAN technology such as Ethernet or IEEE 802.11, the IP node addresses the frame to the IP 
router’s MAC address. 
End-to-end IP routing across an IP network combines direct and indirect deliveries. 
In Figure 5-1, when sending packets to Host B, Host A performs a direct delivery. When sending 
packets to Host C, Host A performs an indirect delivery to Router 1, Router 1 performs an indirect 
delivery to Router 2, and then Router 2 performs a direct delivery to Host C.

IP Routing Table 
A routing table is present on every IP node. The routing table stores information about IP destinations 
and how packets can reach them (either directly or indirectly). Because all IP nodes perform some form 
of IP routing, routing tables are not exclusive to IP routers. Any node using the TCP/IP protocol has a 
routing table. Each table contains a series of default entries according to the configuration of the node, 
and additional entries can be added manually, for example by administrators that use TCP/IP tools, or 
automatically, when nodes listen for routing information messages sent by routers. 
When IP forwards a packet, it uses the routing table to determine: 
The next-hop IP address 
For a direct delivery, the next-hop IP address is the destination address in the IP packet. For an 
indirect delivery, the next-hop IP address is the IP address of a router. 
The next-hop interface 
The interface identifies the physical or logical interface that forwards the packet. 
Routing Table Entries 
A typical IP routing table entry includes the following fields: 
Destination 
Either an IP address or an IP address prefix. 
Prefix Length 
The prefix length corresponding to the address or range of addresses in the destination. 
Next-Hop 
Chapter 5 – IP Routing 
TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows  
Page: 121 
The IP address to which the packet is forwarded. 
Interface 
The network interface that forwards the IP packet. 
Metric 
A number that indicates the cost of the route so that IP can select the best route, among potentially 
multiple routes to the same destination. The metric sometimes indicates the number of hops (the 
number of links to cross) in the path to the destination. 
Routing table entries can store the following types of routes: 
Directly-attached subnet routes 
Routes for subnets to which the node is directly attached. For directly-attached subnet routes, the 
Next-Hop field can either be blank or contain the IP address of the interface on that subnet. 
Remote subnet routes 
Routes for subnets that are available across routers and are not directly attached to the node. For 
remote subnet routes, the Next-Hop field is the IP address of a neighboring router. 
Host routes 
A route to a specific IP address. Host routes allow routing to occur on a per-IP address basis. 
Default route 
Used when a more specific subnet or host route is not present. The next-hop address of the default 
route is typically the default gateway or default router of the node. 
Static and Dynamic Routing 
For IP packets to be efficiently routed between routers on the IP network, routers must either have 
explicit knowledge of remote subnet routes or be properly configured with a default route. On large IP 
networks, one of the challenges that you face as a network administrator is how to maintain the routing 
tables on your IP routers so that IP traffic travels along the best path and is fault tolerant. 
Routing table entries on IP routers are maintained in two ways: 
Manually 
Static IP routers have routing tables that do not change unless a network administrator manually 
changes them. Static routing requires manual maintenance of routing tables by network 
administrators. Static routers do not discover remote routes and are not fault tolerant. If a static 
router fails, neighboring routers do not detect the fault and inform other routers. 
Automatically 
Dynamic IP routers have routing tables that change automatically when the routers exchange 
routing information. Dynamic routing uses routing protocols, such as Routing Information Protocol 
(RIP) and Open Shortest Path First (OSPF), to dynamically update routing tables. Dynamic routers 
discover remote routes and are fault tolerant. If a dynamic router fails, neighboring routers detect 
the fault and propagate the changed routing information to the other routers on the network. 
Chapter 5 – IP Routing 
TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows  
Page: 122 
Dynamic Routing 
Dynamic routing is the automatic updating of routing table entries to reflect changes in network 
topology. A router with dynamically configured routing tables is known as a dynamic router. Dynamic 
routers build and maintain their routing tables automatically by using a routing protocol, a series of 
periodic or on-demand messages that contain routing information. Except for their initial configuration, 
typical dynamic routers require little ongoing maintenance and, therefore, can scale to larger networks. 
The ability to scale and recover from network faults makes dynamic routing the better choice for 
medium, large, and very large networks. 
Some widely used routing protocols for IPv4 are RIP, OSPF, and Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP-4). 
Routing protocols are used between routers and represent additional network traffic overhead on the 
network. You should consider this additional traffic if you must plan WAN link usage.  
When choosing a routing protocol, you should pay particular attention to its ability to sense and recover 
from network faults. How quickly a routing protocol can recover depends on the type of fault, how it is 
sensed, and how routers propagate information through the network. When all the routers on the 
network have the correct routing information in their routing tables, the network has converged. When 
convergence is achieved, the network is in a stable state, and all packets are routed along optimal 
paths. 
When a link or router fails, the network must reconfigure itself to reflect the new topology by updating 
routing tables, possibly across the entire network. Until the network reconverges, it is in an unstable 
state. The time it takes for the network to reconverge is known as the convergence time. The 
convergence time varies based on the routing protocol and the type of failure, such as a downed link or 
a downed router. 
The Routing and Remote Access service  supports the RIP (Windows Server 2008 and Windows 
Server 2003) and OSPF (Windows Server 2003 only) IPv4 routing protocols but no IPv6 routing 
protocols. 
Routing Protocol Technologies 
Typical IP routing protocols are based the following technologies: 
Distance Vector 
Distance vector routing protocols propagate routing information in the form of an address prefix and 
its “distance” (hop count). Routers use these protocols to periodically advertise the routes in their 
routing tables. Typical distance vector-based routers do not synchronize or acknowledge the 
routing information they exchange. Distance vector-based routing protocols are easier to 
understand and configure, but they also consume more network bandwidth, take longer to 
converge, and do not scale to large or very large networks. 
Link State 
Routers using link state-based routing protocols exchange link state advertisements (LSAs) 
throughout the network to update routing tables. LSAs consist of address prefixes for the networks 
to which the router is attached and the assigned costs of those networks. LSAs are advertised upon 
startup and when a router detects changes in the network topology. Link state-based routers build a 
database of LSAs and use the database to calculate the optimal routes to add to the routing table. 
Link state-based routers synchronize and acknowledge the routing information they exchange.  
Chapter 5 – IP Routing 
TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows  
Page: 123 
Link state-based routing protocols consume less network bandwidth, converge more quickly, and 
scale to large and very large networks. However, they can be more complex and difficult to 
configure. 
Path Vector 
Routers use path vector–based routing protocols to exchange sequences of autonomous system 
numbers that indicate the path for a route. An autonomous system is a portion of a network under 
the same administrative authority. Autonomous systems are assigned a unique autonomous 
system identifier. Path vector–based routers synchronize and acknowledge the routing information 
they exchange. Path vector–based routing protocols consume less network bandwidth, converge 
more quickly, and scale to networks the size of the Internet. However, they can also be complex 
and difficult to configure.

IPv4 Routing 
IPv4 routing is the process of forwarding an IPv4 packet based on its destination IPv4 address. IPv4 
routing occurs at a sending IPv4 host and at IPv4 routers. The forwarding decision is based on the 
entries in the local IPv4 routing table. 
IPv4 Routing with Windows 
Computers running current versions of Windows and the supplied TCP/IP protocol use an IPv4 routing 
table. The IPv4 routing table stores information about destinations and how packets can reach them. 
The table contains a series of default entries based on the configuration of the node. You can add 
entries with TCP/IP tools (such as the Route.exe tool) or use a routing protocol to dynamically add 
routes. 
When an IPv4 packet is sent or forwarded, IPv4 uses the IPv4 routing table to determine: 
The next-hop IPv4 address 
For a direct delivery (in which the destination is a neighboring node), the next-hop IPv4 address is 
the destination IPv4 address in the packet. For an indirect delivery (in which the destination is not a 
neighboring node), the next-hop address is the IPv4 address of a router.
