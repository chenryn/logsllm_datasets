I am encountering an issue with files that contain a large amount of data. I need to skip certain operations on these files if their size exceeds a specific threshold.

Currently, I am loading the file content into a variable named `data`. I need to check the size of this variable in bytes, and if it is greater than 102400 bytes, I want to print a message.

**Update:**
- I cannot open the files directly because they are contained within a tar archive.
- The content has already been copied into a variable called `data`.
- I can print the contents of the `data` variable, but I need to check if its size exceeds 102400 bytes.

Thank you for your help.

### Assistant's Response:

Based on the updated information, here is a solution to check the size of the `data` variable and print a message if it exceeds 102400 bytes:

```python
# Assuming 'data' is the variable containing the file content
if len(data) > 102400:
    print("The data size exceeds 102400 bytes.")
else:
    # Proceed with your normal execution
    print("The data size is within the acceptable limit.")
```

This code will check the length of the `data` variable (which represents the number of bytes) and print a message if it is greater than 102400 bytes. If the size is within the limit, you can proceed with your intended operations.
