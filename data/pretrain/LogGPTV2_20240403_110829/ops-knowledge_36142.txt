User: I want to install python2.5.5 in Ubuntu10.10, since Ubuntu10.10 now just supports python>=2.6, so I download source file from python website and try to install it use 
./configure && make && sudo make install, it seems that python2.5.5 has been installed successfully, but when I want to use it, sometimes it says "no module named ...", but it should be bundled, I have used it in my Win7, so I wonder whether I can install all the libs.
Assistant: You can add 10.04 to your apt sources, then you can install in the usual way after an apt-update
