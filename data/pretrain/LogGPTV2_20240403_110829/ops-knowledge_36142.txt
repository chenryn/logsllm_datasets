To install Python 2.5.5 on Ubuntu 10.10, you may face some challenges as this version of Ubuntu supports Python 2.6 and above. You mentioned that you downloaded the source code from the official Python website and attempted to install it using the following commands:

```bash
./configure && make && sudo make install
```

While it seems like Python 2.5.5 has been installed successfully, you are encountering issues where certain modules that should be bundled with Python are not found, leading to "no module named..." errors. This issue did not occur when you used Python 2.5.5 on Windows 7.

One potential solution is to add the Ubuntu 10.04 repositories to your system's APT sources. This will allow you to access and install the required libraries and dependencies for Python 2.5.5. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

1. **Add the Ubuntu 10.04 repository:**
   - Open the `/etc/apt/sources.list` file in a text editor with superuser privileges:
     ```bash
     sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
     ```
   - Add the following lines to the file:
     ```plaintext
     deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ lucid main restricted universe multiverse
     deb-src http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ lucid main restricted universe multiverse
     ```
   - Save and close the file.

2. **Update the package list:**
   - Run the following command to update the package list:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get update
     ```

3. **Install Python 2.5.5 and its dependencies:**
   - Now, you can try installing Python 2.5.5 and its associated libraries:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install python2.5
     ```

By adding the Ubuntu 10.04 repository, you should be able to install the necessary libraries and dependencies for Python 2.5.5, which might resolve the "no module named..." errors you are experiencing.

If you still encounter issues, you may need to manually install the missing modules or consider using a more recent version of Python that is supported by Ubuntu 10.10.
