Assistant: SaaS (Software as a Service), PaaS (Platform as a Service) and IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) are three service models in cloud computing. The differences between them are as follows: 1. SaaS (Software as a Service): It is a A cloud computing model that provides customers with access to applications without downloading or installing the application. Its users can access these applications through a web browser or mobile application, usually on a subscription basis. Common SaaS services include Google Apps, Office 365, and Salesforce, among others. 2. PaaS (Platform as a Service): refers to a platform built on a cloud architecture that enables developers to create, test, deploy, and manage applications on the cloud platform. Developers can use the tools and environment provided by PaaS to develop applications without considering the underlying hardware and operating system during the development process. Common PaaS include IBM Bluemix, Microsoft Azure, and Google App Engine. 3. IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service): It is a cloud computing model that provides customers with computing resources, including computing, storage and network resources. Customers can choose the computing resources of the required scale according to their needs, and pay on demand. Common IaaS include AWS EC2, DigitalOcean, and Microsoft Azure VM, etc. For example: For example, if you want to create a website, you can choose to use SaaS to choose an online website building platform, such as Wix; or you can use PaaS to develop your own website, such as using Google App Engine; or you can use IaaS, rent computing resources, build your own server to deploy your own website.
