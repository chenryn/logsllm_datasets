## Abstract

IPsec provides cryptographic protection for IP packets and is commonly used to build Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). For key establishment, the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) protocol is employed. IKE exists in two versions, each with different modes, phases, authentication methods, and configuration options.

In this paper, we demonstrate that reusing a key pair across different versions and modes of IKE can lead to cross-protocol authentication bypasses, enabling attackers to impersonate a victim host or network. We exploit a Bleichenbacher oracle in an IKEv1 mode where RSA-encrypted nonces are used for authentication. Using this exploit, we break RSA encryption-based modes and RSA signature-based authentication in both IKEv1 and IKEv2. Additionally, we describe an offline dictionary attack against PSK (Pre-Shared Key)-based IKE modes, thus covering all available authentication mechanisms of IKE.

We identified Bleichenbacher oracles in the IKEv1 implementations of Cisco (CVE-2018-0131), Huawei (CVE-2017-17305), Clavister (CVE-2018-8753), and ZyXEL (CVE-2018-9129). All vendors have either published fixes or removed the particular authentication method from their devices' firmware in response to our reports.

## 1. Introduction

Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) allow employees to securely access corporate networks while outside the office and enable companies to connect local networks over the public Internet. Examples of large industrial VPNs include the Automotive Network Exchange (ANX), European Network Exchange (ENX), and Japanese Network Exchange (JNX), which connect vehicle manufacturers with their suppliers. In 4G/LTE networks, wireless carriers use VPNs to secure backhaul links between base stations and the core network. Other applications of VPNs involve circumventing geo-restrictions and censorship.

### 1.1 IPsec and IKE

IPsec (Internet Protocol Security) is a protocol stack that protects network packets at the IP layer. Unlike other widespread cryptographic protocols like TLS (Transport Layer Security) or SSH (Secure Shell), which operate at the application layer, IPsec can protect any IP-based communication. IPsec uses two data formats: AH (Authentication Header) for integrity-only setups and ESP (Encapsulating Security Payload) for confidentiality with optional integrity.

To establish a shared secret for an IPsec connection, the IKE protocol is used. There are two versions of IKE: IKEv1 (1998) and IKEv2 (2005). Although IKEv2 officially obsoletes IKEv1, both versions are still widely implemented and configurable in major operating systems and network devices.

IKE consists of two phases:
- **Phase 1:** Establishes initial authenticated keying material between two peers.
- **Phase 2:** Negotiates further derived keys for multiple IP-based connections.

### 1.2 Authentication in IKE

In IKEv1, four authentication methods are available for Phase 1:
- Two RSA encryption-based methods
- One signature-based method
- A PSK (Pre-Shared Key) based method

All Phase 1 modes/methods include a DHKE (Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange), ensuring PFS (Perfect Forward Secrecy) for every connection. IKEv2 Phase 1 omits both encryption-based authentication methods, leaving only signature and PSK-based authentication.

### 1.3 Attacks

Our attacks target Phase 1 in both IKEv1 and IKEv2, where we impersonate an IKE device. Once successful, attackers share a set of (falsely) authenticated symmetric keys with the victim device and can complete the handshake. We exploit Bleichenbacher oracles in the IKEv1 implementations of Cisco, Huawei, Clavister, and ZyXEL, and show that these oracles can be used to decrypt nonces and forge digital signatures, breaking RSA encryption-based and signature-based authentication in both IKEv1 and IKEv2. We also demonstrate an offline dictionary attack against PSK-based IKE modes, covering all available authentication mechanisms.

### 1.4 Responsible Disclosure

We reported our findings to Cisco, Huawei, Clavister, and ZyXEL. Cisco published fixes with IOS XE versions 16.3.6, 16.6.3, and 16.7.1, and informed us that the vulnerable authentication method would be removed in the next major release. Huawei released firmware version V300R001C10SPH702 for the Secospace USG2000 series, removing the Bleichenbacher oracle and fixing crash bugs. Clavister removed the vulnerable authentication method with cOS version 12.00.09. ZyXEL responded that the affected ZyWALL USG 100 test device is from a legacy model series and will not receive a fix, but the successor models have the patched firmware version ZLD 4.32 available.

## 2. IKE (Internet Key Exchange)

IKE is a family of Authenticated Key Exchange (AKE) protocols responsible for negotiating multiple sets of cryptographic algorithms and keys, called Security Associations (SAs) in IPsec terminology. Each SA can be used to protect the integrity of IP packets with the data format AH or to protect confidentiality with optional integrity using the data format ESP. IKE messages are exchanged over UDP, and the destination port is 500.

### 2.1 IKEv1 Phases

IKEv1 consists of two phases:
- **Phase 1:** Establishes a SA for IKEv1 itself, allowing subsequent Phase 2 messages to be encrypted. A shared symmetric key is also established for Phase 2 authentication.
- **Phase 2:** Negotiates several SAs for IPsec AH and ESP.

#### 2.1.1 IKEv1 Phase 1

For Phase 1, two modes—main mode and aggressive mode—and four authentication methods are available. Main mode involves six messages, while aggressive mode compresses the flow into three messages. We focus on main mode, but our results apply to aggressive mode as well.

- **Messages m1 and m2:** Negotiate on a proposal, similar to TLS ciphersuites.
- **Messages m3 and m4:** Perform a DHKE and exchange ancillary data.
- **Messages m5 and m6:** Used for key confirmation, exchanging MAC values or digitally signed MACs.

#### 2.1.2 IKEv1 Phase 2

Phase 2, also known as quick mode, is a three-message PSK-based authenticated key agreement protocol. Its security is based on the shared keys from Phase 1, and key ke is used to encrypt all messages. Fresh nonces are exchanged for each execution of Phase 2, and a DHKE can be performed if PFS is desired.

### 2.2 IKEv1 Authentication Methods

In Phase 1 of IKEv1, four authentication methods are available:
- **Signature-Based Authentication:** Both parties own asymmetric key pairs with valid certificates and sign their MAC values.
- **PKE (Public Key Encryption):** Nonces are encrypted using the peer's public key.
- **RPKE (Revised Public Key Encryption):** Similar to PKE but with additional protections.
- **PSK (Pre-Shared Key):** Uses a pre-shared key for authentication.

The message exchange patterns in Phase 1 are fixed to main or aggressive mode, but the two communicating entities can negotiate any of these four authentication methods.
