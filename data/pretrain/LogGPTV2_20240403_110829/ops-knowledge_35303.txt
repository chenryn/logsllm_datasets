User: When I try to set aliases, I get two different results using two different methods.  I'm using cygwin.
METHOD 1:
In cygwin I execute the following:
alias python='/cygdrive/c/python27/python.exe'
python <name of python file>
...and it runs just fine, as expected
METHOD 2:
In my bash.bashrc file I add the following line:
alias python='/cygdrive/c/python27/python.exe'
python <name of python file>
...and I get the following error:
:no such file or directoryython.exe
Just two questions:
What is the difference between these two methods? 
Why is one causing and error and one is not?  Thanks <3
Assistant: The error indicate that the bash.bashrc file was not loaded.
Check these:

The bashrc filename is usually .bashrc / .bash_profile and it's in the user's home directory. Or it should exists as /etc/bash.bashrc.
The file is not loaded automatically, restart the shell to load it.
