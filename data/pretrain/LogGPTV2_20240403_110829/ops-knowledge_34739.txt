User: How to analyze the system load of the server and find the bottleneck? Please provide a guide to system load analysis.
Assistant: The following is a guide for system load analysis: 1. View system load averages and trends Use the command line tools top or uptime to view system load averages and trends. The load average is the average number of processes running or waiting to run on the system over a recent period of time. If the load average is consistently higher than the number of system cores, it indicates a bottleneck in the system. 2. View the CPU usage distribution Use the command line tool top or htop to view the CPU usage distribution and determine which processes occupy a large amount of CPU resources. If a process is using a lot of CPU resources, consider optimizing your code or upgrading your hardware for that process. 3. View the memory usage Use the command line tool free or top to view the memory usage and determine which processes occupy a large amount of memory resources. If the system memory is insufficient, consider optimizing the code or increasing the server memory. 4. View disk I/O usage Use the command line tool iostat to view disk I/O usage and determine whether there is a disk read/write bottleneck. If disk I/O usage is high, consider upgrading the disk or optimizing database access. 5. View network usage Use the command line tool iftop to view network usage and determine whether there is a network bottleneck. If the network bandwidth is insufficient, consider increasing the bandwidth or optimizing the network transmission protocol.
