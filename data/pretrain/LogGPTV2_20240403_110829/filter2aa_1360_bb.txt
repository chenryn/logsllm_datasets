select the Public URL link to see the exact address of your new engine. Go to that address and you should see 
a very plain search engine. You can now search any term or terms that you want and receive results for only the 
social networks that you specified. Additionally, you can choose to view all of the results combined or only the 
results of a specific network. Figure 9.04 displays the results when I searched the term osint In this example, I 
have selected the Twitter refinement in order to only display results from twitter.com.
This will create a new tab during your search results that will allow you to isolate Microsoft Word documents. 
By entering both the doc and docx formats, you will be sure to get older and newer documents. The word "OR" 
tells Google to search either format. Repeat this process for each of the following document types with the 
following language for each type.
Create a new custom search engine and tide it "Documents". Add only "google.com" as the website to be 
searched. We do not actually want to search google.com, but a website is required to get to the edit panel. Save 
your engine, click "Edit search engine", and then click "Setup". In the "Sites to search" portion, enable the 
"Search the entire web" toggle. Delete google.com from the sites to be searched. You now basically have a 
custom search engine that will search everything. It will essentially do the same thing as Google's home page. 
You can now add refinements to filter your search results. Navigate to the search features menu and add a new 
refinement. Tide the new refinement "PDF"; change the default setting to "Give priority to the sites with this 
label"; and enter the following in the "Optional word(s)" field.
You can now bookmark this new search engine that you created and visit it whenever you have a target to search. 
You can take your custom search engines to another level by adding refinements that are not website specific. 
In the next example, we will make a search engine that will search the entire internet and allow us to filter by file 
type.
This will create a refinement that will allow you to isolate only PDF documents within any search that yol 
conduct. Save this setting and create a new refinement. Tide it DOC; change the default search setting; and place 
the following in the "Optional word(s)" field.
Figure 9.05 displays the results of a search for the term osint within this new engine. The All tab is selected 
which reveals 717,000 results. Clicking the PowerPoint presentations option (PPT) reveals 45 files which contain 
the term. There are endless possibilities with this technique. You could make an engine that isolated images with 
extensions such as jpg, jpeg, png, bmp, gif, etc. You could also replicate all of this into a custom engine that only 
searched a specific website. If you were monitoring threats against your company, you could isolate only these 
files that appear on one or more of your company's domains.

150 Chapter 9
One negative aspect to custom Google search engines is that they only display the most relevant 100 results. 
These are presented in ten pages of ten results per page. If you are searching very specific terms, this may not 
be an issue. However, standard searches can be limiting.
When you have exhausted the search options on search engines looking for a target, you will want to know if 
new content is posted. Checking Google results every week on the same target to see if anything new is out 
there will get mundane. Utilizing Google Alerts will put Google to work on locating new information. While 
logged in to any Google service, such as Gmail, create a new Google Alert and specify the search term, deliver)' 
options, and email address to which to send the alert In one of my alerts, Google will send an email daily as it 
finds new websites that mention "Open Source Intelligence Techniques" anywhere in the site. Another one of 
my alerts is for my personal website. I now receive an email when another site mentions or links to my website. 
Parents can use this to be notified if their child is mentioned in a website or blog. Investigators that are 
continuously seeking information about a target will find this beneficial.
Google is not the only great search engine. While Google is the overwhelming choice of search engines used 
today, other sites should not be ignored, especially when having trouble locating any information on a subject 
Bing is Microsoft's competition to Google and provides a great search experience. In 2009, Yahoo search 
fyahoo.com) began using the Bing search engine to produce search results. This makes a Yahoo search redundant 
if a Bing search has already been conducted. The same tactics described previously, and in the numerous Google 
books, can be applied to any search engine. The site operator and the use of quotes both work with Bing exactly 
as they do with Google. Bing also introduced time filtered searching that will allow you to only show results 
from the last 24 hours, week, or month. There are a couple of additional operators that are important that only 
apply to Bing. Bing offers an option that will list ever)' website to which a target website links, and is the only 
search engine that offers this semce.
I conducted a search on Bing of "LinkFromDomain-.inteltechniques.com". Note that there are no spaces in the 
entire search string and you should omit the quotation marks. This operator creates a result that includes ever)' 
website to which I have a link, located on any of the pages within my website. This can be useful to an 
investigator. When a target's website is discovered, this site can be large and contain hundreds of pages, blog 
entries, etc. While clicking through all of these is possible, sometimes links are hidden and cannot be seen by 
visually looking at the pages. This operator allows Bing to quickly pull links out of the actual code of the website.
Real World Application: A police detective was assigned a runaway case where a 15-year-old had decided to 
leave home and stay with friends at an unknown location. After several extensive internet searches, a Google 
Alert was set up using the runaway's name and city of residence. Within three days, one of the alerts was for a 
blog identifying the runaway and where she was currendy staying. Within 30 minutes, the unhappy child was 
back home.

Earlier, I discussed searching for files with specific file extensions on Google. The "filetype" and "ext" operators 
that were explained both work on Bing the same way. However, Bing offers one more option to the mix. The 
"contains" operator allows you to expand the parameters of the file type search. As an example, a Bing search 
of "filetype:ppt sitexisco.com" returns 13,200 results. These include PowerPoint files stored on the domain of 
cisco.com. However, these results do not necessarily include links on the cisco.com website to PowerPoint files 
stored on other websites. A search on Bing for "contains:ppt sitexisco.com" returns 36,200 results. These 
include PowerPoint files that are linked from pages on the domain ofcisco.com, even if they are stored on other 
domains. This could include a page on cisco.com that links to a PowerPoint file on hp.com. In most cases, this 
search eliminates the need to conduct a filetype search, but both should be attempted.
Google Images scours the web for graphical images based on a search term. Google obtains these images based 
on keywords for the image. These keywords are taken from the filename of the image, the link text pointing to 
the image, and text adjacent to the image. This is never a complete listing of all images associated with a subject, 
and will almost always find images completely unrelated to a target. In the case of common names, one should 
enclose the name in quotes and follow it with the city where the subject resides, place of employment, home 
town, or personal interests. This will help filter the results to those more likely to be related to the subject When 
results are displayed, clicking the "Tools" button wall present five new filter menus. This menu will allow you to 
filter results to only include images of a specific size, color, time range, image type, or license type. The most 
beneficial feature of Google Images is the reverse image search option. This will be explained in great detail later 
in the book.
Search engines based in the U.S. are not the primary search sites for all countries. Visiting search sites outside 
of the U.S. can provide results that will not appear on Google or Bing. In Russia, Yandex is the chosen search 
engine. Yandex offers an English version at yandex.com. These results are often similar to Google's; however, 
they are usually prioritized differently. In the past, I have found unique intelligence from this site when Google 
let me down. In China, most people use Baidu. It does not offer an English version; however, the site is still 
usable. Striking the "enter" key on the keyboard after typing a search will conduct the search without the ability 
to understand the Chinese text. New results not visible on Google or Bing may be rare, but an occasional look 
on these sites is warranted.
Similar to Google, Bing offers an excellent image search. Both sites autoload more images as you get toward J. 
end of the current results. This eliminates the need to continue to load an additional page, and leads to faster 
browsing. Bing also offers the advanced options available on Google, and adds the ability to filter only files with 
a specified layout such as square or wide. Bing provides a "filter" option in the far right of results that provides 
extended functionality. The People tab offers restriction for images of "Just faces" and "Head & shoulders". It 
also provides suggested filters with every image search. Clicking image search links may provide additional 
photographs of the specific target based on the listed criteria. This intelligence can lead to additional searches 
of previously unknown affiliations.
In a previous edition of this book, I only made a brief reference to Yandex and quickly moved on. In the past 
few years, 1 have discovered many advanced features of Yandex which justify an expanded section. Visually, the 
Yandex home page and search results pages do not possess additional search operators. These options are only 
available by issuing a direct command within your search. While this can be more cumbersome than a Google

Exclude a word: Google and Bing allc 
not technically support this, but it
search, the results can include much new data. Some of these searches can be overkill for daily use, but those 
who conduct brand reputation monitoring or extensive background checks may take advantage of this.
Date specific searches: While Google provides a menu to filter your searches by date, Yandex makes you work 
harder for it You must specify the date range within the search. The following queries should explain the 
options.
Include a specific word: In Google and Bing, you would place quotation marks around a word to identify 
pages that contain that word in diem. In Yandex, this is gained with a plus sign (+). Michael +Bazzell would 
mandate that the page has the word Bazzell, but not necessarily Michael.
low you to use a hyphen (-) to exclude a word in a search. Yandex does 
seems to work fine. The official Yandex operator is the tilde (~). A typical 
search would look like "Michael Bazzell ~ Mike", without the quotation marks. This would identify7 websites 
that contained Michael Bazzell, but not Mike Bazzell. I prefer to stick with the hyphen (-) until it no longer 
works.
Words within the same sentence: The ampersand (&) is used in this query to indicate that you want to search 
for multiple terms. "Hedgehog & Flamingo", without the quotation marks, would identify7 any websites that 
contained both of those words within one sentence. If you want the results to only include sentences that have 
the two words near each other, you can search "Hedgehog /2 Flamingo". This will identify7 websites that have a 
sentence that includes the words Hedgehog and Flamingo within two words of each other.
Words within the same website: Similar to the previous method, this search identifies die searched terms 
within an entire website. "Hedgehog && Flamingo", without quotation marks, would identify7 pages that have 
both those words within the same page, but not necessarily the same sentence. You can also control the search 
to only include results that have those two words within a set number of sentences from each other. A search 
of "Hedgehog && /3 Flamingo", without the quotation marks, would identify websites that have those two 
words within three sentences of each other.
Multiple identical words: This is a technique that I have needed several times in the past before I learned of 
Yandex's options. You may want to search for websites that contain a specific word more than once. An example 
might be if you are searching for someone that has two identical words in his or her full name. "Carina Abad 
Abad" would fit in this scenario. You could use quotation marks to identify7 the majority of the results, but you 
would filter out anything that was not exact such as Abad,Abad, Abad-Abad, or AbadAbad. This is where the 
exclamation point (!) comes in. A search of "ICarina lAbad lAbad", without quotation marks, would identify7 any 
results that included those three words regardless of spacing or punctuation.
Search any word: In Google and Bing, you can use "OR" within a search to obtain results on any of the terms 
searched. In Yandex, this is achieved with the pipe symbol (|). This is found above the backslash (\) on your 
keyboard. A search of "+Bazzell Michael | Mike | M", without quotation marks, would return results for Michael 
Bazzell, Mike Bazzell, and M Bazzell.
Exact terms: Similar to Google and Bing, quotation marks will search for exact terms. Searching "Michael 
Bazzell" inside of quotes would search those terms, and would avoid "Mike" or "Bazel".
Missing word: You can search an exact phrase without knowing every7 word of the phrase. A search for "Open 
Source * Techniques" inside of quotation marks will identify7 any results that include that phrase with any word 
where the asterisk (*) is located. This identified not only results with the tide of this book, but also results for 
"Open Source Development Techniques" and "Open Source Responsive Techniques". This search can be very7 
useful for identifying a person's middle name. "Michael * Bazzell" produced some interesting results.

If you want to search Google within a version specified for another country, this site simplifies the process. 
Choose the country and language, and the tool will do the rest. While testing this service, I entered Japan as my 
country, English as my language, an iPad as my device, and OSINT as my search term. 1 was presented a 
google.co.jp search page in tablet view. Many results were similar to the U.S. version, but all were in a unique 
order. 1 find this useful when searching for international targets when 1 do not want bias toward a U.S. user. 
The "News” tab of foreign searches is often catered toward that geographical audience. This can display 
emphasis on news articles which would otherwise be buried in a typical Google result page.

There are hundreds of additional international search engines. Of those, most are extremely specialized and do 
not offer great general search. The following have been most beneficial to my international investigations, in 
order of usefulness. I have included a direct search URL, which could be useful for your custom search tools.
Standard operators: Most of the operators explained earlier for Google and Bing should also work in Yandex. 
The commands for Site, Domain, Inurl, and Intitle should work the same way. Yandex maintains a list of 
operators at https://yandex.com/support/search/how-to-search/search-operators.html. All Yandex operators 
work together and multiple operators can be used to form very specific searches. Figure 9.06 displays the results 
for a search of any websites from 2013 with the phrase Michael Bazzell and the word OSINT while excluding 
the word Mike.

When conducting a Google search, notice the result address directly below the link to the website. You will see 
a green down arrow that will present a menu when clicked. This menu will include a link titled '’Cached". Clicking 
it will load a version of the page of interest from a previous date. Figure 9.07 (first image) displays a search for 
phonelosers.org which returns a result that includes a cached version of the page. This version was taken four 
days prior to the current date, and displays information different from the current version. The second option 
visible within this menu, titled "Similar", identifies web pages that contain content similar to the listed result.
Occasionally, you wall try to access a site and the information you are looking for is no longer there. Maybe 
something was removed, amended, or maybe the whole page was permanently removed. Web archives, or 
"caches" can remedy this. I believe that these historical copies of websites are one of the most vital resources 
when conducting any type of online research. This section will explain the current options in order from most 
effective to least
Similar to Google, Bing offers a cached view of many websites. Searching for a domain name, such as 
phonelosers.org, will present many results. The first result should link to the actual website. Directly next to the 
website name is a small green down arrow. Clicking it will present the option of "Cached page". Clicking this 
link will display a previous version of the target website as collected by Bing. Figure 9.07 (second image) displays 
their menu option.
The Russian search engine Yandex wall be explained in great detail later, but it is important to note now that it 
also possesses a cache option. Very similar to Google and Bing, Yandex presents a green drop-down menu 
directly under the title of the search result Figure 9.07 (third image) displays their cache menu option. Selecting 
the Cached page option opens a new tab displaying the most recent Yandex archive of the page. The top banner 
displays the date and time of capture, the original website address, and a search option to highlight selected 
keywords within the result The biggest strength of the Yandex cache is the lack of updates. While this may 
sound counterintuitive, an older cache can be very helpful in an investigation. Assume that the Phone Losers 
website was your target At the time of this demonstration, September 7, 2019, the Google, Bing, and Yandex 
caches of this page were dated as follows.
If you have a specific page within a website that you want to view as a cached version, type the exact website 
into Google to link to the cached page. For example, if I wanted to see a previous view of the podcast for The 
Phone Show, an audio archive about telephone pranks, I would conduct a Google search for the site 
"www.phonelosers.org/snowplowshow". This will return the main landing page as well as sub-pages that will 
each have a cached view. If any of these pages were to go offline completely, Google would hold the last obtained 
version for viewing. I could have also typed the following directly into any Google search page to be navigated 
directly to the cached page.
Baidu Cache (baidu.com)
The Wayback Machine (archive.org/web/web.php)
Wayback Search
https://web.archive.org/web/*/Michael Bazzell
Searching All Resources
Until 2016, you could not search keywords across Wayback Machine data. You had to know the exact URL of 
a target website, or at least the domain name. Today, we can search any terms desired and connect directly to 
archived data. At the time of this writing, a search bar was present at the top of every Wayback Machine page. 
If that should change, you can also conduct a search via a direct URL. The following address searched "Michael 
Bazzell" throughout die entire archive of information.
Occasionally, there are websites that surface claiming to be able to extract and rebuild entire websites from 
online caches. In my experience, none of these have ever provided a complete historical view versus a manual 
approach. Engines such as Bing and Yandex generate a unique code when a cache is displayed. This action 
prevents most automated search tools from collecting archived information. 1 do not believe any option, other 
than navigating to each resource, will present you with the content that you need. 1 bookmark each of diese 
services in an individual folder tided Archives and open each tab when I have a domain as a target. I have also 
created an online tool that will collect your target domain and forward you to the appropriate archive page. This 
will be explained later when discussing domain searches.
This Chinese search engine is the least productive as far as cached copies of websites are concerned, but it should 
not be ignored. It will be explained further during a later discussion about international engines. The results of 
a search on Baidu are mosdy in Chinese, but can still be valuable to those that cannot read the text. At the 
bottom of each search result is a green link to the website that hosts the content of the result. While this also 
includes a drop-down menu, the cache option is not there. Instead, look for a word in Chinese direcdy to the 
right of this link. In Figure 9.07 (fourth image) it is displayed as 
Clicking this link will open a new
tab with the cache result, which Baidu refers to as a snapshot. In my experience, the presence of this linked 
option does not always mean that a cached version exists.
The Wayback Machine will provide a much more extensive list of options for viewing a website historically. 
Searching for phonelosers.org displayed a total of 1,280 captures of the site dating from 12/21/1997 through 
6/10/2019 (Figure 9.08). Clicking the links presents quite a display of how the site has changed. Graphics are 
archived as well, proving that we should always think twice about which photos we post to the internet Each 
view of the archived page will allow the user to click through the links as if it were a live page on the original 
web server. Clicking through the timeline at the top of each page will load the viewed page as it appeared on the 
date selected.
