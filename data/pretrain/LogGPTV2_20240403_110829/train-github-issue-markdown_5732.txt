I am trying to determine if it is possible to achieve the desired profiling results. I attempted to use the CPU profiler from the "net/http/pprof" package, but without a binary, I was unable to obtain any useful information when running the `top` or `list` commands. I also tried unpacking the APK and using the `.so` file as the binary, but this approach did not yield any meaningful data either.

- **Host OS:** Windows 8.1
- **Mobile OS:** Android 4.4

Is there a way to resolve this issue, or am I making a significant mistake in my approach?
