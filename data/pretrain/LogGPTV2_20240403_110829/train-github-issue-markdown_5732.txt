I wonder if that can be achieved. I tried to to use cpu profiler using
"net/http/pprof", but without binary it didn't manage to get anything useful
for top or list commands. Unpacked apk and used .so as binary but it also
didn't help.
Host OS - Windows 8.1.  
Mobile OS - Android 4.4.
Can be anything done about it? Or I am doing something severely wrong?
