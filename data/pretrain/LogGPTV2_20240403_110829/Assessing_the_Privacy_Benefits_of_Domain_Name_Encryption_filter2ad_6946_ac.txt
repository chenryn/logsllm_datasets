of those addresses may be different. Consequently, the k value of
a multi-hosted domain is calculated as the median k of all its IP
addresses.1 In both cases, the privacy gain increases linearly with
k. Based on these definitions, we now explore the privacy gain of
domains hosted on different hosting and CDN providers.
Table 1 shows the top-ten hosting providers offering the high-
est median k-anonymity per IP address (i.e., greater than 500). As
shown in the third column, the average number of unique IP ad-
dresses observed daily for each provider is very low, with half
of them hosting all domains under a single IP address. Using the

Hurricane Electric BGP Toolkit, we confirmed that these providers
are indeed small, with many of them managing less than 10K IP
addresses allocated by regional Internet registries. When looking
into the popularity of the websites hosted by these providers, as
shown in the last column, the highest ranked website is only at
the 386th position, hosted on Squarespace, while more than half of
these providers host websites that are well below the top 10K.
Next, we investigate the k-anonymity offered by major providers
that dominate the unique IP addresses observed. Table 2 lists the
top-20 major hosting and CDN providers with more than 5K unique
IP addresses observed. Unlike small hosting providers, these major
providers are home to more popular sites. Indeed, the most popular
sites hosted by these providers are all within the top 10K. In con-
trast to small providers, however, the median k-anonymity per IP
address offered by these providers is quite low, meaning that sites
hosted on them will gain a much lower level of privacy. Except
from Cloudflare, which has the highest k of 16, all other providers
have a single-digit k.
Tables 1 and 2 represent two ends of the privacy spectrum for
multi-hosted domains. On one end, numerous but less popular do-
mains are hosted on providers managing a handful of IP addresses,
benefiting from high k-anonymity; on the other end, fewer but more
popular websites are hosted on providers managing a much larger
pool of millions of IP addresses, suffering from low k-anonymity.
To provide an overall view of the whole privacy spectrum, Fig-
ure 4 shows CDFs of k of all studied domains across nine different
regions. As illustrated, k values are almost identical across the nine
regions from which we conducted our measurements. While our
DNS data shows that there are 471K (CDN-supported) domains
served from different IP addresses depending on the resolution
location, the k values of these domains remain similar regardless
of the DNS resolution origin.
As discussed in§3, a low (e.g., single-digit) k cannot allow ESNI to
offer meaningful privacy, given that i) not all k sites will be equally
popular, and ii) website fingerprinting can be used to improve

attribution accuracy even further [17, 65, 78, 81, 99]. Assuming that
k needs to be greater than 100 to provide meaningful privacy, since
an adversary would correctly guess a domain being visited with
a probability less than 1%, then according to Figure 4, only about
30% of the sites will benefit from domain name encryption. We
conduct a more in-depth analysis of the probability with which an
adversary would correctly guess domains being visited based on
Zipf’s law in §5.3.
Finally, we examine the top-10 providers that host the largest
number of domains among the ones studied. Although these mostly
include some of the providers listed in Table 2, two of them are not
included on that table, and one (Squarespace) is actually included
in Table 1. The violin plot of Figure 5 depicts the top-ten providers
that host most domains. The area of each violin is proportional to
the number of domains hosted by that provider, while the shape of
each violin illustrates the popularity ranking distribution of hosted
websites. The median k of each provider is denoted by the red dot.
Google and Cloudflare are the top hosting providers, with more
than 500K domains each. Other providers host different numbers
of domains, ranging from 315K to 123K.2 Although hosting fewer
domains, both Automattic and Squarespace provide significantly
higher privacy with a k of 110 and 705, respectively.
5.3 Weighting the Privacy Benefit Based on
Domain Popularity
In §5.2, we used the k-anonymity model to quantify the privacy
benefit provided by multi-hosted domains. However, one might
consider that the model does not accurately capture a real-world
adversary, as not all co-hosted domains are equally popular. Adver-
saries could base their guess on the probability that a domain is
more (or less) likely to be visited, according to the visit frequency
of that domain compared to other co-hosted domains. However, it
is infeasible for us to obtain the data of domain visit frequencies,
since this is only known by the respective hosting providers.
Fortunately, prior studies have shown that the relative visit
frequency of domains follows Zipf’s law [15, 106]. More specif-
ically, Zipf’s law states that the relative probability of a domain
(d) being visited is inversely proportional to its popularity ranking

ited domain based on the k-anonymity value and popularity
ranking information, as percentage of all tested domains.
(Pd ∝ 1/(rankd)α ). We thus apply Zipf’s law3 on the popularity
ranking of domains to compute the probability with which an ad-
versary can correctly guess that a given domain is being visited.
From a privacy-detrimental IP address, it is straightforward for
the adversary to learn the domain being visited as the IP address
solely hosts that single domain. However, given a privacy-beneficial
IP address that hosts multiple domains, a more realistic adversary
would make his guess based on the probability that a domain is
more likely to be visited compared to other co-hosted domains.
In order to compute this probability, we first obtain the domains
d1, . . . , dn that are hosted on a single IPj and compute their Pd
values according to Zipf’s law. We define Pdi j
as the
probability that domain di was visited when IPj was observed.
Pdin
For domains that are hosted on multiple IP addresses, the proba-
bility is estimated by taking the median of all probabilities that the
domain is visited from all IP addresses hosting it. We therefore com-
pute the probability that an adversary can correctly guess domain

2Note that a website may be hosted on more than one provider [52]. In that case, we
count the site separately for each hosting provider.
3For simplicity, we present results with α = 1, following the strict Zipf’s law. However,
adjusting the value of α to match previous observations [15] also gave similar results.

As shown in Figure 6, our k-anonymity model is a close lower
bound to the case where the adversary considers the popularity
rankings. The figure shows two CDFs of the probability that the
adversary can guess which domain is being visited. The continuous
(blue) line is computed based on the k-anonymity value of co-hosted
domains. Each domain has an equal probability of 1/k to be visited.
The dashed (red) line is computed by applying the Zipf’s law on
the domain popularity. We can see that even if adversaries rely
on domain popularity rankings to improve the accuracy of their
prediction, the highest probability that this guess is correct is similar
to the probability estimated by the k-anonymity value.
5.4 Domain-to-IP Mapping Stability
Besides the degree of co-hosting, the stability of a website’s IP ad-
dress(es) also plays an important role in whether ESNI will provide
meaningful privacy benefits. If the IP address of a website changes
quite frequently, this will have a positive impact on the privacy
offered due to ESNI. Unless adversaries have enough resources to
acquire all domain-to-IP mappings of interest at almost real-time,
they will no longer be able to use the destination IP address as
an accurate predictor of the visited website, because a previously
known domain-to-IP mapping may not be valid anymore. On the
other hand, mappings that remain stable over the time make it
easier for adversaries to monitor the visited websites.
In this section, we examine the stability of domain-to-IP map-
pings, and how it affects privacy. We are particularly interested in
finding how often domain-to-IP mappings change. As discussed
in §4, all top lists of popular sites have their own churn (i.e., new
sites appear and old sites disappear from the lists on a daily basis).
To prevent this churn from affecting our analysis, we consider only
the subset of domains that were present daily on both top lists
(§4.2) during the whole period of 61 days of our study. This set of
domains comprises 2.6M domains, from which we observed a total
of 22.7M unique domain-to-IP mappings because a domain may be
hosted on hundreds of IP addresses.
Figure 7 shows the distribution of the longevity of these map-
pings in days. More than 80% of the mappings last less than four

term domain-to-IP mappings.
consecutive days (short-term mappings), corresponding to 202K
(7.7%) domains served from 400K unique IP addresses. On the other
hand, 13% of the mappings remain unchanged for the whole study
period (long-term mappings), corresponding to 2.4M domains served
from 1.1M unique IP addresses. As also shown in Figure 7, there are
two dominant clusters of domains that either change their hosting
IP addresses frequently or do not change at all. This is a favor-
able result for adversaries, as it implies that they do not have to
keep resolving a large number of domains, since most domain-to-IP
mappings remain quite stable over a long period.
The popularity distribution of the domains that correspond to
these two short-term and long-term mappings is shown in Figure 8.
While domains with short-term mappings are evenly distributed
across the popularity spectrum, domains with long-term mappings
slightly lean towards lower popularity rankings. This result can be
attributed to the fact that more popular websites are more likely
to rotate their IP addresses for load-balancing reasons, while less
popular sites are more likely to be served from static IP addresses.
An increased churn of IP addresses also helps ESNI provide better
privacy. We thus investigated which providers exhibit the highest
churn rate by grouping the IP addresses of short-term mappings ac-
cording to their ASN. Figure 9 shows the top-ten providers with the
highest number of IP addresses in short-term mappings (bars). The
dots indicate the number of domains hosted on those IP addresses.
Although Amazon and Akamai do not top the list of providers that
host most domains (Figure 5), along with Cloudflare they occupy
the top five positions of the providers with the highest number of
dynamic IPs. Google uses a relatively small pool of around 5.3K IP
addresses, to host more domains (41K) than the other providers.
6 COMPARISON WITH OTHER DATASETS
In this section, we analyze existing public DNS datasets to examine
the impact of i) larger datasets (in terms of number of domains),
and ii) more localized vantage points, on the estimation of per-
domain k-anonymity.
The Active DNS Project [61] is currently collecting A records of
about 300M domains derived from 1.3K zone files on a daily basis.
In addition to this effort, Rapid7 [87] also conducts active DNS
