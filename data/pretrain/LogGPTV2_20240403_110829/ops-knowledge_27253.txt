What is the difference between authentication and authorization?

Assistant: Authentication is the process of verifying who you are. When you log on to a PC with a user name and password you are authenticating.
Authorization is the process of verifying that you have access to something. Gaining access to a resource (e.g. directory on a hard disk) because the permissions configured on it allow you access is authorization.
