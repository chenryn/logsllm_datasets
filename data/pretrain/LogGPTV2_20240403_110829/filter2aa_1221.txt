Flying With Firearms 
Domestic Laws & Policies 
from the TSA’s “Prohibited Items” list… 
http://www.tsa.gov/travelers/airtravel/prohibited/permitted-prohibited-items.shtm 
Ammunition - Check with your airline or travel agent to see if ammunition is permitted in checked baggage on 
the airline you are flying. If ammunition is permitted, it must be declared to the airline at check-in. Small arms 
ammunitions for personal use must be securely packed in fiber, wood or metal boxes or other packaging 
specifically designed to carry small amounts of ammunition. Ask about limitations or fees, if any, that apply. 
Firearms - firearms carried as checked baggage MUST be unloaded, packed in a locked hard sided container to 
which no one else has a key, and declared to the airline at check-in. 
Flare Guns - May be carried as checked baggage MUST be unloaded, packed in a locked hard sided container 
to which no one else has a key, and declared to the airline at check-in. 
All of the above may not be kept in carry-on luggage but are acceptable in checked bags. While conventional 
ammunition (as seen above) is legal in checked baggage, flares may not be in one’s luggage at all. Also totally 
not permitted are un-loaded propellants (gunpowder, black powder, percussion caps) unless they are part of 
loaded cartridges properly packed according to the above regulations.

• You must declare all firearms to the airline during check-in. 
• Firearms must be unloaded. 
• Firearms must be packed in hard-sided containers. 
• Said containers must be locked. A locked container is defined as one that completely secures the 
firearm from access by anyone other than you. 
• If you are not present and a security officer must open the container, we or the airline will make a 
reasonable attempt to contact you. 
• You must securely pack any ammunition in fiber (such as cardboard), wood, or metal boxes or other 
packaging that is specifically designed to carry small amounts of ammunition. 
• You can't use firearm magazines/clips for packing ammunition unless they completely and securely 
enclose the ammunition (e.g., by securely covering the exposed portions of the magazine or by securely 
placing the magazine in a pouch, holder, holster or lanyard). 
• You may carry the ammunition in the same hard-sided case as the firearm, as long as you pack it as 
described above. 
as clarified by a call to the TSA’s public inquiry call center… 
on a March 2nd, 2009 call to 866-289-9673 we asked about flare guns and blank-firing weapons 
Flare Guns / Blank Guns - “[flare guns] have the same procedure for lethal firearms... the gun case should 
be a hard sided container with a lock that only you possess the key to… [blank-firing weapons] should all travel 
the same way, in a hard sided container that only you possess the key to, unloaded, and declared.” 
as specified by 27 CFR 478.31 - Delivery by common or contract carrier…

Outside Tags - No common or contract carrier shall require or cause any label, tag, or other written notice to 
be placed on the outside of any package, luggage, or other container that such package, luggage, or other 
container contains a firearm.
