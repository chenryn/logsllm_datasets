### Traveling with Firearms: Domestic Laws and Policies

#### Overview of TSA Regulations
For the most up-to-date information, please refer to the TSA’s “Prohibited Items” list:
- [TSA Prohibited Items List](http://www.tsa.gov/travelers/airtravel/prohibited/permitted-prohibited-items.shtm)

#### Ammunition
- **Check with your airline or travel agent** to confirm if ammunition is allowed in checked baggage.
- If permitted, **declare the ammunition to the airline at check-in**.
- **Pack small arms ammunition for personal use** in a secure, fiber, wood, or metal box, or other packaging specifically designed for small amounts of ammunition.
- **Inquire about any limitations or fees** that may apply.

#### Firearms
- **Declare all firearms to the airline during check-in**.
- **Ensure firearms are unloaded**.
- **Pack firearms in a hard-sided, locked container**. The container must be secured so that no one else can access the firearm.
- **If a security officer needs to open the container and you are not present, they will make a reasonable attempt to contact you**.

#### Flare Guns
- **Flare guns must be unloaded, packed in a locked, hard-sided container, and declared to the airline at check-in**.
- **Flares are not allowed in luggage** at all, whether in carry-on or checked bags.

#### Additional Guidelines
- **Conventional ammunition** (as described above) is allowed in checked baggage.
- **Unloaded propellants** (such as gunpowder, black powder, and percussion caps) are not permitted unless they are part of loaded cartridges, which must be properly packed according to the regulations.
- **Ammunition must be securely packed** in fiber (e.g., cardboard), wood, or metal boxes, or other packaging specifically designed for small amounts of ammunition.
- **Firearm magazines or clips** can be used for packing ammunition only if they completely and securely enclose the ammunition (e.g., by securely covering the exposed portions of the magazine or by placing the magazine in a pouch, holder, holster, or lanyard).
- **Ammunition can be carried in the same hard-sided case as the firearm**, provided it is packed as described above.

#### Clarification from TSA
- According to a call to the TSA’s public inquiry call center on March 2nd, 2009 (866-289-9673):
  - **Flare guns and blank-firing weapons** should follow the same procedures as lethal firearms. They must be in a hard-sided, locked container, and declared to the airline.
  
#### Federal Regulations
- **27 CFR 478.31 - Delivery by Common or Contract Carrier**:
  - **No common or contract carrier** shall require or cause any label, tag, or other written notice to be placed on the outside of any package, luggage, or other container indicating that it contains a firearm.
  - [27 CFR 478.31](http://cfr.vlex.com/vid/31-delivery-common-contract-carrier-19675270)

By following these guidelines, you can ensure that your firearms and ammunition are transported safely and in compliance with both TSA and federal regulations.
