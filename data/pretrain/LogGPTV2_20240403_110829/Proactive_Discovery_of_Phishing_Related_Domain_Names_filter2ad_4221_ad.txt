# Proactive Discovery of Phishing-Related Domain Names

## 4. Experimental Results

### 4.1 Distribution of Discovered Domains Over Time
Figure 7 shows the distribution of discovered domain names over time, specifically regarding when they are blacklisted.

### 4.2 Number of Discovered Domain Names by Method
Figure 8 illustrates the number of domain names discovered using different methods. The methods tested include:
- **MC + 5/20 DISCO**: The Markov chain model and for each selected state of the Markov chain, five words randomly picked from the twenty most related words, as determined by Disco, are tested.
- **MC + 5/50 DISCO**: The Markov chain model and for each selected state of the Markov chain, five words randomly picked from the fifty most related words, as determined by Disco, are tested.

The objective of this assessment is to identify the best trade-off between the success rates in discovering rogue domain names and the computational effort required.

### 4.3 Performance Analysis
Figure 8 shows the number of actual generated malicious domain names with respect to the number of probes performed over a probing campaign. The same training set is used to build the generation model for the four different probing campaigns. 

- The Markov chain model alone yields the best results in terms of the number of malicious domain names discovered, with a total of 370.
- DISCO strategies generate only between 57 and 90 malicious domain names over these campaigns, depending on the technique. However, between 79% and 85% of these generated domains are unique, meaning none of the other strategies are able to find them.

For a comprehensive probing campaign, all parts of the generation module should be utilized to discover the maximum number of phishing-related domain names. However, the Markov chain model is sufficient for finding domains over a short period of time.

### 5.1 Heuristic-Based Approaches
Heuristic-based approaches rely on classification algorithms to identify whether a domain is malicious or not, based on features extracted from different sources. Machine learning techniques are widely used for this purpose, including batch methods such as SVM, Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression, as well as online classification algorithms like Conﬁdence Weighted (CW), Adaptive Regularization of Weight (AROW), and Passive-Aggressive (PA).

- In [2–4], classification models are built using passively gathered DNS queries to identify predominantly malware domains involved in botnet communications.
- For phishing detection, host-based features (e.g., WHOIS info, IP prefix, AS number) and web page content-based features are used [15, 25].
- Features extracted from URLs, such as protocol type, hostname, TLD, domain length, and URL length, are also common [5, 9, 11].

### 5.2 Blacklisting Approaches
Blacklisting approaches involve the partial manual construction of a list of malicious URLs that web browsers or email clients use to prevent users from accessing them. Due to the short lifetime of phishing websites, early identification is crucial. Several methods have been proposed to avoid reactive blacklisting and develop more proactive methods.

- Hao et al. [10] analyze the early DNS behavior of newly registered domains, identifying patterns in DNS infrastructure and lookup behavior.
- Felegyhazi et al. [7] mine zone information to check if other domains are registered at the same time, on the same name server, and with the same registrar, assuming a known malicious domain.

### 5.3 Predictive Blacklisting
Predictive blacklisting involves predicting future attackers from the mining of logs. Zhang et al. [28] propose a method where a host can create its own customized blacklist based on the similarity of attack patterns with other hosts.

- Prakash et al. [20] introduce Phishnet, which discovers new phishing URLs based on existing blacklists. This method clusters URLs based on shared domain names, IP addresses, or directory structures and generates new URLs using regular expressions.

### 5.4 Our Approach
Our work extends previous research by leveraging a Markov chain model and relevant lexical features extracted from a semantic splitter. We have demonstrated that our method can generate hundreds of new domain names that are actually related to phishing and appear to be in use following their generation.

## 6. Conclusion and Future Work

This paper introduces an efficient monitoring scheme for detecting phishing sites. The main idea is to generate a list of potential domain names that might be used in the future by an attacker. This list can be checked daily to detect the appearance of new phishing sites. The list is generated using language models applied to known ground truth data.

- We have proposed a novel technique to generate domain names following a given pattern learned from existing domain names.
- The efficiency of this generation tool has been tested on real-world datasets of phishing domain names, proving that our method can generate hundreds of new domain names related to phishing.

To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the only one to propose proactive generation and discovery of malicious domains, complementing state-of-the-art approaches that focus on proactive blacklisting of URLs.

### Future Work
- Implement the remaining part of the architecture, the domain checker.
- Use feedback from the domain checker to adapt the Markov chain transition probability through reinforcement learning to strengthen the generation model.
- The code is available upon request.
