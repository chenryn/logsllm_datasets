### Analysis of Attack Models and System Performance

The partial information that certain types of attackers possessed about the signatures is not surprising. In Figure 16(a), we present the maximum achievable recall for each victim under all attack models, with the precision set to 100%. This figure highlights the trade-off between security and usability. For example, Operator #1 may configure KinWrite to prevent random attackers from passing verification with high confidence, while Operator #2 may tune it to block insider attackers. Consequently, on average, an honest user would require fewer trials to pass verification in the first system compared to the second.

Figure 16(b) shows the precision when the recall is 75%. This figure illustrates how easily an attacker can pass verification if the system is tuned to allow users to pass 75% of the trials on average. Our experiments revealed that CA (Context-Aware) attackers, Ob (Observation) attackers, and CA&Ob-4 (Combined Context-Aware and Observation) attackers had a slightly higher chance of passing verification than random attackers. However, KinWrite rejected all five types of attackers with an average probability of 97%, and insider attackers with an average probability of 75%.

### Impact of Signature Choice on KinWrite Performance

The choice of signature significantly affects KinWrite's performance, as some signatures are more resistant to shoulder surfing than others. For instance, the signature 'Tj' was the most difficult to imitate among the four tested signatures, and multiple observations did not improve the imitation. In contrast, the signature 'Bry' was the easiest to mimic, and repeated observations enhanced the imitation. Feedback from the 'attackers' indicated that 'Bry' was signed much more slowly than 'Tj', making it easier to imitate. Interestingly, providing the spelling of 'Bry' and 'Tj' to the Ob-4 attackers reduced their ability to mimic, as they began to write the text in their own style rather than emulating the signature motion.

### Summary of Experimental Results

Our experiments demonstrate that KinWrite can effectively reject most attackers with a high probability. Even against strong attackers, such as insider attackers, KinWrite performs well. In real-world applications, many of these attacks, especially insider attacks, can be mitigated through physical protection or good system design. For example, knowing the exact shape of a 3D-signature increases the likelihood of a successful attack, so KinWrite does not display the signed 3D-signature in real-time and only stores the normalized feature vectors of templates.

### Conclusion

We have designed a behavior-based authentication system called KinWrite, which can be used for building access control. By allowing users to sign their passwords in 3D space, we transformed short, easy-to-crack passwords into behavioral biometrics, i.e., 3D-signatures. KinWrite uses Kinect, a low-cost motion input sensor, to capture fingertip movements when a user signs their password in space, and constructs a 3D-signature. To verify a user, we extracted features likely to contain personal gesture information and used Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to calculate the similarity between samples. One advantage of using DTW is that KinWrite only needs to store one template per user.

To evaluate KinWrite's performance, we collected 1180 samples for 35 different signatures over five months. Additionally, we modeled five types of attackers who attempted to impersonate a legitimate user, and collected 1200 3D-signature samples from 18 'attackers'. The evaluation results showed 100% precision and 99% recall on average in the presence of random attackers, and 100% precision and 77% recall on average for all attackers. These results indicate that KinWrite can deny unauthorized access requests with a high probability, and honest users can gain access with an average of 1.3 trials.
