ABSTRACT 
This  article  investigates  whether  individual  users  are  more  likely 
to display malicious behavior after receiving social reinforcement 
from  friends  in  their  online  social  networks.  We  analyze  the 
dynamics of game bot diffusion on the basis of real data supplied 
by  a  major  massively  multiplayer  online  role-playing  game 
company. We find that the social reinforcement, measured by the 
ratio  of  bot  friends  over  total  friends,  affects  the  likelihood  of 
game bot adoption and the commitment in terms of usage time.

1.  INTRODUCTION 
In massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMOPRGs), 
players engage in a variety of interactions with other players and 
form online social networks. A complete digital record of players’ 
activities  in  MMORPGs  provides  a  promising  opportunity  to 
study the dynamics of human behavior. As online social networks 
have  begun  to  play  an  important  role  in  shaping  behavior,  the 
analysis of human interaction in the context of online friendships 
has  become  a  viable  research  topic.  Extreme  opinions/behaviors 
were  also  explored  in  diffusion  models  [1].  The  use  of  drugs, 
tobacco, and alcohol have been proven to have a significant effect 
on the contagion process between people. The popularity of online 
social  networks  has  spurred  researchers  to  study  the  diffusion  of 
user  behaviors.  Centola  [2]  conducted  an  experiment  to  trace 
health behavior diffusion in online communities. Romero et al. [3] 
studied 
in  Twitter. 
MMORPGs are also an interesting arena to observe how behavior 
spreads, a subject has not yet been deeply explored. In this article, 
we  aim  to  analyze  the  dynamics  of  bot  diffusion  based  on  real 
data of major MMORPGs and to test whether individual adoption 
is  more  likely  when  users  receive  reinforcement  from  multiple 
friends in their social networks. We focus on malicious behavior,

2.  RESULTS 
We used the dataset (between December 21, 2010, and March 21, 
2011) from AION, a prominent MMORPG developed by NCSoft. 
In  Aion,  like  other  MMORPGs,  there  are  various  networks 
depending  on  interaction  types  such  as  communication  through 
chat,  email,  messaging,  trade,  party  play,  joining  guilds,  and 
building friendships [4]. Here, we specifically focus on friendship 
networks  formed  by  individual  normal  users.  We  excluded  the 
gold  farming  workshops  because  gold  farmers  do  not  form 
friendships  with  others,  even  members  in  the  same  group. 
Generally,  only  bankers  and  merchants  who  trade  assets  develop 
friendship networks. In Table 1, we present characteristics of the 
friendship  networks  of  Aion  and  ArcheAge  (until  Jan-13). 
ArcheAge  is  a  recently  launched  MMORPG  developed  by 
XLgames,  and  its  social network  is  still  in  its  initial  stage before 
the  appearance  of  the  game  bot.  Compared  to  well-known  social 
networks  [5],  Aion  users  have  fewer  friends  and  user’s  friends 
tend not to form extended networks.

In  January  14,  the  adoption  ratio,  the  ratio  of  characters  newly 
marked by the bot detection code, namely new adopters, over total 
active  characters  was  0.04(963/19,833).  Of  19,833  characters, 
10,508 characters formed a friendship network and 128 characters 
were  suspected  to  be  new  adopters.  We  consider  the  characters 
who  did  not  have  bot  usage  records  during  December  21,  2010 
and  January  13,  2011  as  new  adopters.  On  the  network  formed 
before  January  13,  the  adoption  ratio  reached  10.91%  and  the 
increase of the adoption ratio became saturated after 40 days. This 
implies that the game company needs to restrain users from using 
bots from the beginning stage of the game to prevent contagion of 
friends.  For  the  initial  test  of  contagion,  we  calculated  the  bot 
adoption  ratio,  which  was  0.16  when  the  user  was  exposed  and 
0.05  when  the  user  was  not  exposed.  We  measured  the  social 
reinforcement effect on bot adoption in terms of various metrics: 
• 
Accumulated signals from friends: bot_score 
543The number of bot friends: influential_no 
The number of friends: related_no 
The largest signal from bot friends 
Number of banned friends for bot usage: anti_score 
influential_ratio=influential_no/related_no 
•

Figure  1  shows  the  cumulative  distribution  functions  (CDFs)  of 
new  adopters  and  normal  users  according  to  the  degree  of  social 
reinforcement  measured  by  each  metric.  The  more  friends  a 
character  had  and  the  more  friends  who  adopted  game  bots,  the 
greater  was  the  character’s  tendency  to  adopt  a  game  bot. 
However, characters who received larger signals from friends and 
who  accumulated  more  signals  from  bot  friends  did  not  increase 
the  chance  of  game  bot  adaptation.  The  experimental  findings 
were quantified as the hazard ratio. A discrete-time hazard model 
estimated  the  hazard  ratio  of  influential_no,  related_no,  and 
influential_ratio  at  1.041,  1.011,  and  3.222, 
respectively, 
excluding  anti_score.  This  implies  that  the  ratio  of  bot  friends 
over total friends has the largest influence on game bot adoption. 
Despite  the  expectations  of  game  companies,  banning  individual 
users  does  not  prevent  the  infection  of  game  bot  usage  (i.e., 
players  adopt  game  bots  regardless  of  whether  their  friends  are 
banned or not). At the individual level, results show that the high 
ratio  of  bot  friends  over  total  friends  increases  the  likelihood  of 
adoption  (Figure  2).  This  implies  that  social  reinforcement  from 
many  friends  makes  players  much  more  likely  to  yield  to  the 
temptation of the game bot. However, when the ratio exceeds one-
third, the likelihood decreases.

The  secondary  issue  is  the  level  of  commitment  that  users  have 
after  adoption.  The  influential  ratio  also  affects  how  long  the 
character uses the game bot but does not affect how frequently the 
character  uses  the  game  bot  (Figure  3).  Furthermore,  we  tested 
whether  adopters  keep  or  stop  using  the  game  bot  according  to 
whether  he or  she  is  exposed.  The  retention  rate of  the  game  bot 
was 0.61 when the user was exposed and 0.40 when the user was 
not. 
In all experiments,  we  found strong evidence for the diffusion of 
malicious  behavior  on  friendship  networks  in  MMORPGs. 
Specifically,  social  reinforcement  measured  by  the  ratio  of  bot 
friends over total friends affects the likelihood of adoption and the 
commitment  in  terms  of  usage  time.  Our  current  work  includes 
the  analysis  on  the  effect  of  network  structure  on  the  diffusion 
process.  For  that,  we  perform  the  community  detection  and  trace 
the  diffusion  process  according  to  the  community.  Second,  we 
investigate 
the  effect  of  social  reinforcement  on  stopping 
malicious  behavior.  We  expect  the  anti_score  to  have  a  positive 
effect  on  stopping  bot  usage  and  influential_ratio  to  have  a 
negative effect.
