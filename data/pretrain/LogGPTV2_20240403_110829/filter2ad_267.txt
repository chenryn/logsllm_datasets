## Abstract
This study investigates whether individual users are more likely to display malicious behavior after receiving social reinforcement from friends in their online social networks. We analyze the dynamics of game bot diffusion using real data provided by a major massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) company. Our findings indicate that social reinforcement, measured by the ratio of bot-using friends over total friends, significantly affects the likelihood of game bot adoption and the commitment in terms of usage time.

## 1. Introduction
In MMORPGs, players engage in various interactions with other players, forming online social networks. These digital records provide valuable insights into human behavior. As online social networks play an increasingly important role in shaping behavior, the analysis of human interaction in the context of online friendships has become a significant research topic. Studies have shown that behaviors such as drug, tobacco, and alcohol use can spread through social networks. For instance, Centola [2] traced the diffusion of health behaviors in online communities, and Romero et al. [3] studied information diffusion on Twitter.

MMORPGs offer a unique environment to observe how behaviors spread, particularly malicious behaviors like the use of game bots. In this article, we aim to analyze the dynamics of bot diffusion based on real data from major MMORPGs and to test whether individual adoption is more likely when users receive reinforcement from multiple friends in their social networks. Understanding these dynamics will help in developing effective counterstrategies.

## 2. Results
We used a dataset from AION, a prominent MMORPG developed by NCSoft, covering the period from December 21, 2010, to March 21, 2011. In Aion, there are various types of networks, including communication through chat, email, messaging, trade, party play, guilds, and friendships. We focused on friendship networks formed by individual normal users, excluding gold farming workshops.

Table 1 summarizes the basic network characteristics of Aion and ArcheAge, compared to well-known social networks like Facebook and Flickr. Aion users generally have fewer friends, and their friends tend not to form extended networks.

| Network | Nodes, # | Links, # | Avg. Degree | Clustering Coefficient |
|---------|----------|----------|-------------|------------------------|
| Aion    | 18,761   | 80,026   | 4.3         | 0.073                  |
| ArcheAge| 11,433   | 33,724   | 3.0         | 0.076                  |
| Facebook| 63,730   | 817,090  | 25.7        | 0.22                   |
| Flickr  | 2,302,924| 22,838,276| 20.9        | 0.18                   |

On January 14, the adoption ratio, defined as the ratio of characters newly marked by the bot detection code over total active characters, was 0.04 (963/19,833). Of 19,833 characters, 10,508 formed a friendship network, and 128 were suspected new adopters. The adoption ratio reached 10.91% within 40 days, suggesting that early intervention is crucial to prevent the spread of bot usage.

For the initial test of contagion, we calculated the bot adoption ratio, which was 0.16 for exposed users and 0.05 for non-exposed users. We measured the social reinforcement effect on bot adoption using several metrics, including the number of bot friends, the number of friends, and the largest signal from bot friends.

Figure 1 shows the cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of new adopters and normal users according to the degree of social reinforcement. Characters with more friends and more bot-using friends were more likely to adopt a game bot. However, larger signals from friends did not increase the likelihood of bot adoption. The hazard ratio for influential_no, related_no, and influential_ratio was 1.041, 1.011, and 3.222, respectively, indicating that the ratio of bot friends over total friends has the greatest influence on bot adoption.

Despite expectations, banning individual users does not prevent the spread of bot usage. At the individual level, a high ratio of bot friends increases the likelihood of adoption (Figure 2), but the likelihood decreases when the ratio exceeds one-third.

The secondary issue is the level of commitment after adoption. The influential ratio affects the duration of bot usage but not the frequency (Figure 3). The retention rate of the game bot was 0.61 for exposed users and 0.40 for non-exposed users.

In all experiments, we found strong evidence for the diffusion of malicious behavior in MMORPG friendship networks. Specifically, social reinforcement, measured by the ratio of bot friends over total friends, affects the likelihood of adoption and the commitment in terms of usage time.
