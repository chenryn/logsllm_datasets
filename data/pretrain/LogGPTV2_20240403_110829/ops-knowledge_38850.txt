It seems like you're encountering an issue with the `dnspython` module not being recognized by your Python environment, even after a successful installation. Here's a more structured and professional way to address the problem:

### Issue Description
I have been using the `dnspython` module in my Python projects. However, when I tried to use it on a new Linux installation, the module is not being loaded. I have attempted to clean up and reinstall the module, but the installation does not seem to be working.

### Environment Details
- **Python Version:**
  ```sh
  $ python --version
  Python 2.7.3
  ```

- **pip Version:**
  ```sh
  $ pip --version
  pip 1.0 from /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages (python 2.7)
  ```

- **Python Executable Path:**
  ```sh
  $ which python
  /usr/bin/python
  ```

### Installation Attempt
```sh
$ sudo pip install dnspython
Downloading/unpacking dnspython
  Downloading dnspython-1.11.1.zip (220Kb): 220Kb downloaded
  Running setup.py egg_info for package dnspython

Installing collected packages: dnspython
  Running setup.py install for dnspython

Successfully installed dnspython
Cleaning up...
```

### Import Error
```sh
$ python
Python 2.7.3 (default, Sep 26 2013, 20:03:06) 
[GCC 4.6.3] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import dns
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "", line 1, in 
ImportError: No module named dns
```

### Additional Information
- I have a firewall installed on the new machine. I am not sure if it should affect the import, but I have tried disabling it, and the issue persists.

### Suggested Solution
To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. **Ensure Correct Python and pip Versions:**
   Verify that you are using the correct versions of Python and pip. You can do this by checking the output of the following commands:
   ```sh
   $ which python
   $ python --version
   $ which pip
   $ pip --version
   ```

2. **Install `dnspython` Using pip:**
   Ensure that `dnspython` is installed for the correct Python environment. If you are using `conda`, activate the appropriate environment first:
   ```sh
   $ conda activate base
   $ pip install dnspython
   ```

3. **Verify Installation:**
   After installation, verify that `dnspython` is installed in the correct site-packages directory. You can find the location of the site-packages directory by running:
   ```sh
   $ python -c "import site; print(site.getsitepackages())"
   ```

4. **Copy `dnspython` to Python Site-Packages (if necessary):**
   If `dnspython` is installed in a different location (e.g., in an Anaconda environment), you may need to copy the `dns` folder to the Python site-packages directory. However, this is generally not recommended. Instead, ensure that you are using the correct Python interpreter and that the `dnspython` package is installed for that interpreter.

5. **Check for Multiple Python Installations:**
   Ensure that there are no multiple Python installations causing conflicts. You can check the Python path by running:
   ```sh
   $ python -c "import sys; print(sys.path)"
   ```

6. **Reinstall `dnspython`:**
   If the above steps do not resolve the issue, try uninstalling and reinstalling `dnspython`:
   ```sh
   $ pip uninstall dnspython
   $ pip install dnspython
   ```

### Conclusion
If the problem persists, please provide additional details about your environment, such as the output of the commands mentioned above. This will help in diagnosing the issue further.

Thank you for your assistance.
