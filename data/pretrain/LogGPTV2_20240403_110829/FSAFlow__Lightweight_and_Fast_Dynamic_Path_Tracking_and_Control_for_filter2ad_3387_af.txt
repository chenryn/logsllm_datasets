cases with taint propagation in loop bodies. The input parame-
ters  of  GT  included  the  number  M  of  variables  (including  a

source variable in and a sink variable out), the number N of 
statements contained in a loop body, the number of loop laps L 
(L>M), and the number K of loop nesting layers. Each statement 
was a simple assignment of x=y or x=0. GT first randomly gen-
erated schemes of assignment statements in loop bodies, then 
the schemes with propagation from in to out in the loop bodies 
were selected. A test case in the form of a java file was gener-
ated according to a selected scheme. The case first obtained the 
mobile IMEI and then sent the information by SMS after prop-
agating in nested loops. Because L>M, all the cases had loop 
stable periods. Three groups of cases were output. Each group 
had 20 cases that used the same parameter settings. The test re-
sults are listed in Table III. FlowDroid did not track in loop sta-
ble periods, causing all leakage paths to be missed and misre-
ported 95 paths that did not actually occur. FSAFlow only mis-
reported three paths and had no false negatives. The exceptions 
had forms akin to a loop body: {out=in, in=0;}. Although out 
was infected in the first round, it was cleaned again in the sec-
ond round. Such loop processing may have little meaning since 
it rarely appears in practice. 
3) Finally, the functions were evaluated on 150 popular real-
world apps from HUAWEI and Google’s app store. These were 
randomly  selected  from  15  different  categories.  These  apps 
were shown as benign by VirusTotal, an authoritative website 
that provides malware-analysis services. For the paths found by 
FlowDroid,  FSAFlow,  and  TaintDroid,  since  there  was  no 
available information about the privacy leakage of these apps, 
manual horizontal comparison and analysis were conducted ac-
cording to the app functions, self-declarations, and user com-
ments on the app stores, The test results are listed in Table IV.  
Thirty-two  apps  were  found  that  have  potential  leakage 
paths. The main basis of judgment was that these release paths 
were not identified by the declarations of these apps, and they 
were not related to the main functions. For example, the Cur-
rency world app in the Finance category collects user accounts 
and writes them to a local file without prompting the user. The 
Fit fitness app in the Sports and Health category sends location 
data to advertising service providers.  
All three tools exhibit analysis errors. As for false negatives, 
TaintDroid missed two leakage paths on LETV video, dragonfly 
FM in the Media and Entertainment category because it did not 
track  interface  input  information  (e.g.,  passwords),  while 
FSAFlow  and  FlowDroid  reported  correctly.  However, 
FSAFlow  and  FlowDroid  failed  to  report  one  leakage  path 
where the information of dynamic reflection is stored in config-
uration files, such as Car Headlines from the  Cars category, 
while TaintDroid reported correctly. Regarding false positives, 
the three tools all misreported one leakage path involving arrays 
in Baby Read from the Kids category because of their coarse 
tracking  granularity  for  arrays.  Besides,  FlowDroid  misre-
ported 1 leak path that will not occur in the Touch app of the 
Communication category. The APK file of this application con-
tains  debugging  code  that  does  not  execute  at  runtime. 
FSAFlow could avoid this misreport by runtime verification. 
B.  Performance Evaluation 
FSAFlow’s  performance  was  evaluated  by  comparing  it 
with some representative optimization techniques on DTA. In 
the  evaluations,  the  implicit  flow  analysis  was  enabled  in 
FSAFlow only, since the DTA techniques used for comparison
