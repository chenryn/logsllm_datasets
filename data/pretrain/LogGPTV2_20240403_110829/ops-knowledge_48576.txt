When a user enters `hockeybias.com` into their browser to access my hockey news aggregation site, the default page loads correctly, as it has in the past and continues to do so today. However, since this summer, entering `www.hockeybias.com` results in the following error message:

```
Error: Not Found
The requested URL / was not found on this server.
```

This is a relatively new issue, as `www.hockeybias.com` previously worked without any problems. The problem seems to have arisen after I migrated from the 'Master/Slave Datastore' version of Google App Engine (GAE) to the 'High Replication Datastore' (HRD) version earlier this summer. The issue persisted even after I upgraded the site from Python 2.5 to Python 2.7.

To resolve this issue, I followed these steps:

1. Navigated to the Google Cloud Console: `console.developers.google.com`.
2. Selected the project `hockeybias-hrd`.
3. Went to the App Engine section and selected `Settings`.
4. Under the `Domains` tab, I clicked on `Add a custom domain`.
5. In the second step of the process, I entered `www` as the subdomain in the provided text box. Initially, the text box displayed `www` in greyed-out text, and the `Add` button was disabled. However, I realized that I could still enter the value.
6. After entering `www` and clicking the `Add` button, the issue was resolved.

It's worth noting that this was the second time I was misled by Google's use of greyed-out text, which can sometimes be interpreted as a disabled field.
