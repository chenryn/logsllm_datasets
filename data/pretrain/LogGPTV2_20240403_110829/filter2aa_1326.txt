#### Show of Hands
- Gun Owners
- Regular Shooters
- Those Who Have Used a Firearm Defensively
- Considering a Purchase

#### Overview
This talk will cover:
- Defensive Firearm Ownership
- Legal Hardware (no full-auto modifications)
- Legal Requirements (permits, licenses, CCW)

It will **not** cover:
- Full-auto modifications
- Illegal activities

#### Four Rules of Firearm Safety
1. Always treat a firearm as if it is loaded.
2. Never point a firearm in a direction you wouldn't fire.
3. Be aware of your target and what is beyond it.
4. Keep your finger off the trigger until ready to shoot.

#### Why Choose to Own Guns?
- It's not just about "bad neighborhoods."
- Hope for the best, prepare for the worst.
- The "worst" can occur anywhere, regardless of location (natural disasters, civil unrest, mass hysteria).
- Even the most restrictive regions or nations can have high violent crime rates.

#### Topics to be Discussed
- Weapon Selection
- Ammunition Selection
- Training and Practice
- Psychological Considerations
- Legal Notes

### Weapon Selection
- **Rifles vs. Shotguns vs. Handguns**
  - Rifles are generally not recommended for defensive use.
  - **Shotguns**
    - **Types: Pump, Autoloading, Old Style**
      - Pump action shotguns (e.g., Remington 870, Mossberg 500/590) are highly reliable.
      - Consider capacity, versatility, ease of use, and handling.
      - Safe and ready storage.
      - Accessories: slings, lights, sidesaddles.
  - **Handguns**
    - **Types: Revolver vs. Autoloading Pistol**
      - **Revolver**
        - Reliable and simple.
        - Easy to store ready.
      - **Pistol**
        - Higher capacity.
        - Faster reloads.

### Maintenance
- Regular cleaning after each use.
- Professional gunsmithing when needed.
- Proper storage.

### Ammunition
- **Caliber**
  - Handguns: 9mm, .38, .40, .45
  - Shotguns: 12 gauge
- **Preventing Over-Penetration**
  - Hollow points, frangible rounds, and shotshells.
  - Less lethal options (e.g., pepper spray, less-than-lethal ammunition).

### Less Than Lethal Solutions
- **Pepper Spray** (often legal)
- **Brass Knuckles / Billy Clubs** (less legal)
- **Less Than Lethal Ammunition**
  - Shotshells (potentially useful)
  - Pistol ammo (tricky and potentially problematic)
- **Check Local Laws** (many nuances, especially with CCW)

### Training and Practice
- Regular practice is essential.
- Find a good range near you.
- Shoot often (frequency depends on personal schedule).
- Focus on repetition and muscle memory.
- Practice drawing, rapid fire, and tactical reloading.
- Consider defensive shooting courses.

### Psychological Considerations
- Mentality of shooting.
- Can you take a life if necessary?
- Increased stakes with CCW.
- Aftermath of a shooting.

### Legal Notes
- Follow ownership and carry laws.
- Risks of breaking the law include prosecution, incarceration, and loss of firearms.
- Prevention of future ownership.
- When and how to use deadly force.
- Obligations during and after a shooting.
