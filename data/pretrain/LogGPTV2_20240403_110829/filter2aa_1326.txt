What This Talk Is About 
(and what it’s NOT about)
• Defensive Firearm Ownership
• Hardware Within the Law 
(sorry full auto modders)
• People Within the Law 
(permits and licenses, i.e. CCW)
Four Rules of Firearm Safety
1. 
Always treat a weapon as loaded
2. Never point in a direction you wouldn’t fire
3. Be aware of your target and what is beyond
4. Finger off the trigger until ready to shoot

Why Choose To Own Guns?
• It’s not about “Bad Neighborhoods”
• Hope for the Best & Prepare for the Worst
• The “worst” can get pretty bad on some very rare 
occasions, no matter where you live 
(Natural Disasters, Civil Unrest, Mass Hysteria, etc.)
• The most restrictive  regions (or nations) can 
have some of the worst  violent crime rates.
We Will Discuss…
• Weapon Selection
• Ammo Selection
• Training and Practice
• Psychological Considerations
• Legal Notes
Weapon Selection
• Rifles  vs.  Shotgun  vs.  Handgun
• Rifles are almost completely off the list
Weapon Selection
• Rifles  vs.  Shotgun  vs.  Handgun
• Rifles are almost completely off the list
• Shotguns
• Actions, Pros & Cons, Versatility, Reliability
• Handguns
• Actions, Pros & Cons, Versatility, Reliability
Shotguns
• Pump  vs.  Autoloading vs.  Old Style
hard to top a good pump action 
(Remington 870 or Mossberg 500/590)
Shotguns
• Pump  vs.  Autoloading vs.  Old Style
• Capacity, Versatility, Ease of Use, Handling
• Storing Safely  &  Storing Ready
• Accessories  (slings, lights, sidesaddles)
Handguns
• Revolver  vs.  Autoloading Pistol
Handguns
• Revolver  vs.  Autoloading Pistol
– Revolver
• Reliable & Simple
• Storing Ready
– Pistol
• More Rounds
• Faster Reloads
Maintenance
• No matter what you choose, it will only 
perform properly if you take care of it
• Cleaning after every use
• Smithing by professionals
• Proper storage
Ammunition
• Caliber (not too big, not too small)
– 9mm  .38  .40  .45  range for handguns
– 12 gauge for shotguns
• Preventing over-penetration
– Hollow points, frangible rounds, shotshells
– Less than lethal ammo? (graduated loading)
Less Than Lethal Solutions
• Pepper Spray (often legal)
• Brass Knuckles / Billy Clubs (not as legal)
• Less than Lethal Ammunition
– Shotshells (decent and potentially useful)
– Pistol Ammo (tricky and potentially problematic)
• Check the law… many subtle nuances
– CCW changes a lot of things (even knives)
Training and Practice
• Don’t just leave your weapon in a closet 
(or worse, on your person if you’re a CCW holder)
• Find a good range near you
• Shoot often (how often?)
• Repetition and Muscle Memory
• Predictability
– Handling, Patterning, etc
• Does your range allow more?
– Drawing, Rapid Fire, Tactical Reloading
• Defensive Shooting Courses
Psychological Considerations
• Mentality of Shooting
• Could you take a life?
• CCW increases the stakes
• Aftermath
Legal Notes
• Ownership laws are important to follow
• Carry laws are important to follow
• Risks of breaking the law
• Prosecution / Incarceration
• Losing whole collection
• Prevention of future ownership
• When you can use deadly force
• Obligations during and after a shooting
Rules of Firearm Safety Again
1. 
Always treat a weapon as loaded
2. Never point in a direction you wouldn’t fire
3. Be aware of your target and what is beyond
4. Finger off the trigger until ready to shoot
