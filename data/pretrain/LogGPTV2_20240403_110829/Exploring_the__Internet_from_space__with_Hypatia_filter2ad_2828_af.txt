congestion window in Fig. 19(b) show the effect of the aforemen-
tioned sharing of the network device between the data packets and
the ACKs. The throughput over the bent-pipe connection is also
modestly lower for the same reason, as seen in Fig. 19(c).
We also see, from comparing Fig. 19(a) and Fig. 19(b), that at
least in this instance, TCP behavior is markedly different for the
bent-pipe connection, with many more fluctuations in the conges-
tion window. The reason is that ISLs and bent-pipe connectivity
engender different bottleneck behavior in this case. The bottleneck
with ISLs, is the outgoing network device from the first (source)
GS. For the bent-pipe, due to the sharing of the path across data
packets and ACKs, the bottleneck is the first satellite-to-ground
link. Now as satellites in the path change, specifically the first
satellite, the queue size at this satellite varies substantially over
time. Re-ordering events that trigger TCP to interpret loss occur at
ùë° = 52.9, 86.3, 92.5, 147.2, and 162.1 ùë†, the precise points in Fig. 19(b),
where the congestion window drops.
Note that this low-level behavior depends on how the network
devices are configured, e.g., multiple separate queues for uplink
traffic would change the behavior substantially. With cross-traffic,
the ISL case may also exhibit similar behavior, with more frequent
reordering as the bottleneck moves away from the first up-link
device. We thus caution readers against drawing deeper conclusions
on TCP behavioral differences in bent-pipe versus ISL connectivity
from this small experiment; this experiment is merely meant to
demonstrate Hypatia‚Äôs ability to support bent-pipe constellations.

A GROUND STATION RELAYS
Hypatia easily accommodates experimentation with constellations
that eschew inter-satellite connectivity. In this scenario, ground
station relays provide ‚Äúbent pipe‚Äù connectivity with long-distance
communication going up and down through satellites and GSes [31].
To demonstrate this capability of Hypatia, we simulate a long-
lived TCP flow from Paris to Moscow over the first shell of Kuiper‚Äôs
K1 shell (Table 1). We compare the behavior of the flow in two
scenarios: (a) the constellation model used in the rest of the paper,
i.e., with one GS-satellite link followed by a series of ISLs, followed
by a satellite-GS link; and (b) without any ISLs, using only bent-pipe
connectivity through GS relays. For the latter case, we add a grid
of ground stations between Paris and Moscow such that there are
multiple relays that can be chosen from.
Fig. 16(a) and Fig. 16(b) show the situation at the start (ùë° = 0)
for the two scenarios. Fig. 18(c) compares the path RTT over time
for the two scenarios absent any traffic. As expected, the bent-pipe
connectivity results in higher latency, typically by around 5 ms.
Fig. 17 shows the paths at a different time (around ùë° = 159 s), near
the ‚Äúpeak RTT‚Äù in Fig. 18(c).
While a variety of configurations are possible for network de-
vices, for this experiment, we configured the network devices at
the satellites to have a fixed total up-bandwidth, and to use the
same queue for all outgoing traffic. This implies that for the bent-
pipe connection, an on-path satellite‚Äôs GSL uplink queue is shared
by the TCP packets traveling in one direction (from a GS to the
satellite) and the corresponding ACKs traveling in the opposite di-
rection (from a different GS to the satellite). Our experiment shows
the impact of this for a uni-directional TCP NewReno flow from
Paris to Moscow. Both the estimated RTT in Fig. 18(b) and the TCP

(c) Bent-pipe achieves modestly lower rate.
Fig. 19: TCP behaves differently for the ISL and bent-pipe cases, primarily due to different bottleneck behavior as the ACKs share the same
bottleneck in our configuration for bent-pipe connectivity.
