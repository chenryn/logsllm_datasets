### Current Behavior

The application fails to launch when using Angular 4.0.0-beta.8 with ES5 JavaScript and DSL. The following errors are encountered:

1. **Application Launch Failure:**
   - **Error Message:** `Unhandled Promise rejection: Cannot read property 'merge' of undefined`
   - **Stack Trace:**
     ```
     Zone: <root>;
     Task: Promise.then;
     Value: TypeError: Cannot read property 'merge' of undefined
     ```

2. **Module Initialization with `canActivate` / `canDeactivate` Options:**
   - **Error Message:** `EXCEPTION: Uncaught (in promise): TypeError: Cannot read property '$$observable' of undefined`
   - **Stack Trace:**
     ```
     TypeError: Cannot read property '$$observable' of undefined
     ```

### Expected Behavior

The application should launch and function normally without any unhandled exceptions.

#### Workarounds

1. **To Fix Application Launch Failure:**
   Add the following lines to `index.html`:
   ```html
   <script>
     window.rxjs_observable_merge = Rx.Observable;
     window.rxjs_operator_share = Rx.Observable.prototype;
   </script>
   ```

2. **To Fix Module Initialization with `canActivate` / `canDeactivate` Options:**
   Add the following lines to `index.html`:
   ```html
   <script>
     Rx.Symbol.$$observable = Rx.Symbol.observable;
     window.rxjs_symbol_observable = Rx.Symbol;
   </script>
   ```

### Motivation for Changing the Behavior

The goal is to ensure that the application launches and operates correctly without encountering these errors.
