### Security Risk Analysis of Smart Home Devices

#### Introduction
This document presents an analysis of the security risk perceptions associated with various smart home devices. The goal is to identify pairs of product categories that are statistically significantly different in their security risk perception (criterion C1) and not significantly different in other factors (criterion C2). We have highlighted pairs of product categories that meet these criteria.

#### Methodology
We conducted multiple t-tests on the same dataset for criterion C2. However, we did not perform a Bonferroni correction because omitting it results in a more conservative testing procedure for measuring the similarity of product categories.

#### Notation
- Statistically significant: *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001

#### Data Summary
The following table summarizes the t-test results and effect sizes (dz) for various pairs of smart home devices:

| Device Pair | t(29)       | dz         |
|-------------|-------------|------------|
| Light bulb - Door lock | -2.266*    | -0.414     |
| Light bulb - Home Camera | -2.371*   | -0.433     |
| Light bulb - Smoke detector | -7.062*** | -1.289     |
| Light bulb - Thermostat | -6.519*** | -1.190     |
| Light bulb - Vacuum robot | -4.636*** | -0.846     |
| Light bulb - Weather station | -3.600** | -0.657     |
| Light bulb - Alarm system | -8.148*** | -1.488     |
| Door lock - Home Camera | 0.024      | 0.134      |
| Door lock - Smoke detector | -3.621** | -0.661     |
| Door lock - Thermostat | -4.036*** | -0.737     |
| Door lock - Vacuum robot | -2.780** | -0.508     |
| Door lock - Weather station | -0.306  | -1.677     |
| Door lock - Alarm system | -2.991** | -0.546     |
| Home Camera - Smoke detector | -3.876** | -0.708     |
| Home Camera - Thermostat | -4.200*** | -0.767     |
| Home Camera - Vacuum robot | -2.631* | -0.480     |
| Home Camera - Weather station | -0.247  | -1.354     |
| Home Camera - Alarm system | -2.667* | -0.487     |
| Smoke detector - Thermostat | -0.056  | -0.308     |
| Smoke detector - Vacuum robot | 0.193  | 1.054      |
| Smoke detector - Weather station | 2.234* | 0.408      |
| Smoke detector - Alarm system | 0.242  | 1.325      |
| Thermostat - Vacuum robot | -0.062  | -0.338     |
| Thermostat - Weather station | -1.970  | -0.360     |
| Thermostat - Alarm system | -4.224*** | -0.771     |
| Vacuum robot - Weather station | -4.811*** | -0.878     |
| Vacuum robot - Alarm system | -2.783** | -0.508     |
| Weather station - Alarm system | -1.891  | -0.345     |

#### Highlighted Pairs
The following pairs of product categories meet the criteria of being statistically significantly different in their security risk perception and not significantly different in other factors:

- **Light bulb - Smoke detector**
- **Light bulb - Thermostat**
- **Light bulb - Alarm system**
- **Door lock - Smoke detector**
- **Door lock - Thermostat**
- **Home Camera - Smoke detector**
- **Home Camera - Thermostat**

#### Conclusion
This analysis provides insights into the security risk perceptions of different smart home devices. By identifying pairs of devices that are significantly different in security risk but similar in other factors, we can better understand consumer perceptions and guide future product development and marketing strategies.
