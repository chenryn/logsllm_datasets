Assistant: This log chunk shows multiple attempts to access the LabSZ software component from various IP addresses. The first attempt was from 173.234.31.186, which was closed due to preauth. The second attempt was from 202.100.179.208, which was an invalid user. The third attempt was from 5.36.59.76, which was a failed password for root. The fourth attempt was from 112.95.230.3, which was also a failed password for root.
