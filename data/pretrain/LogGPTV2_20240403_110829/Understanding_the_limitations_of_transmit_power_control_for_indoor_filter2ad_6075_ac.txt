Figure 6: Probability distribution of RSSI for the
four traces shown in Figure 5. The spread in RSSI
distribution is noticeable in all the traces, with the
NLOS-heavy trace having the maximum deviation.
In the NLOS-heavy scenario, the RSSI values show
persistent ﬂuctuations about two diﬀerent RSSI val-
ues (bimodal distribution).
The sampling period is varied by averaging n adjacent values
of Ti so that τ = nτ0. Now the Allan deviation for diﬀerent
values of n can be given by:
sPN−2n+1
σy(τ ) =

The Allan deviation inherently provides a measure of the
behavior of the variability of a quantity as it is averaged
over diﬀerent measurement time periods, which allows it to
directly quantify and distinguish between diﬀerent types of
RSSI variations. The Allan deviation will be high for inter-
val lengths near the characteristic burst length. At smaller
intervals, adjacent recent samples will change slowly, and
the Allan deviation will be low. At longer intervals, each
sample will tend towards the long term average, and the
Allan deviation will again be small.
Figure 7 shows the Allan deviation of RSSI over large
scale packet intervals (thousands of packets). We can ob-
serve that although there are no prominent peaks for the
RSSI bursts for any scenario, but Allan Deviation becomes
quite stable (between 0.2 and 0.5) for LOS-light, NLOS-light
and LOS-heavy scenarios. The NLOS-heavy has relatively
higher deviation and shows signiﬁcant ﬂuctuations in the
range of (1.6-1.8).
In Figure 8, we show the zoomed ver-
sion for Allan deviation for intervals less than 100 packets.
This ﬁgure shows the short term characteristic of RSSI vari-
ations. As clear from the ﬁgure, Allan deviation for LOS-
light, NLOS-light and LOS-heavy is maximum at 1 packet,
then decreases sharply because averaging over longer inter-
vals rapidly smoothes out ﬂuctuations. This means that the
RSSI variations for the aforementioned three categories are
independent for intervals less than 100 packets. On the other
hand, NLOS-heavy shows sharp increase in Allan Deviation
from 0.6 to 1.4. This indicates that in NLOS-heavy trace,
the RSSI averaged over small sample sizes (τ in Equation
2), change quickly leading to a sharp increase in Allan De-
Figure 7: Allan deviation for the four representative
traces shown in ﬁgure 5. The y axis shows the Allan
deviation (σ(τ )), while the value of n (sampling pe-
riod in Equation 2) is varied on the x axis. It shows
that there are no clear peaks for the RSSI bursts
for any scenario, however it is clear that Allan De-
viation becomes quite stable (between 0.2 and 0.5)
for LOS-light, NLOS-light and LOS-heavy scenar-
ios. The NLOS-heavy has relatively higher devia-
tion and shows signiﬁcant ﬂuctuations but remains
in the range of (1.6-1.8).
viation at such small scales. On further analysis, we found
that deviation for NLOS-heavy reaches 1.7 for about 400-
500 packets and as shown in Figure 7, ﬂuctuates around that
value for larger packet intervals as well. We agree that there
is no clear decrease in the Allan deviation for any scenario,
so we approximate the value of burst size at the point when
the deviation becomes quite stable (or the rate of increase in
deviation becomes very low). Hence we choose ≈ 400 pack-
ets for NLOS-heavy and on the order of thousand packets
for LOS-heavy, LOS-light and NLOS-light.
We report these burst size for various LOS and NLOS sce-
narios in Table 1. The burst size information is used by our
algorithm Online-RSSI (explained in Section 3.5), that sam-
ples the packets in multiples of these burst sizes for deter-
mining the signal strength distribution for a given transmit
power level. As RSSI varies signiﬁcantly across bursts, the
online mechanism needs to consider at least an increment
of burst size in its sampling process to determine if the on-
line distribution being computed has stabilized. This allows
us to quickly converge on an accurate RSSI distribution as
explained in Section 3.5.
Summary: RSSI variations are bursty for intervals of the
order of ≈ 1000 packets for LOS-light, NLOS-light and LOS-
heavy scenarios. But for NLOS-heavy traces, the Allan de-
viation increases even in the small interval of 100 packets,
depicting bursts even in short packet intervals. This can be
explained because the interference coupled with multipath
eﬀects make the wireless channel highly variable and leads to
bursts even in very short time intervals. This behavior was
observed in all our NLOS-heavy traces (for various receivers)
and indicates high variability in wireless environment. Allan
deviation provides an estimate of burst length of a trace and
as shown in Figure 6. On the basis of insights obtained from
the oﬄine analysis, we then present a simple online mecha-
nism to dynamically determine the number of packets suﬃ-
cient to characterize RSSI distribution in any environment.
Let us deﬁne the actual probability distribution function
for RSSI (over large packets ≈ 100, 000) as p(x). The ap-
proximate distribution obtained by our mechanism is de-
noted by q(x). We now describe the statistical measure that
we use to quantify the performance of the model.

Figure 8: Zoomed version of Allan deviation for
short interval of time (≈ 100 packets). Allan
deviation decreases sharply for LOS-light, NLOS-
light and LOS-heavy traces, indicating independent
packet losses. But Allan deviation for NLOS-heavy
increases, indicating very small bursts and highly
variable wireless channel. This is a strong indica-
tion that ﬁne grained power control becomes even
more diﬃcult when multipath eﬀects are coupled
with 802.11 interference.
could be interpreted as an eﬀect of temporal variations in
wireless channel. So if Allan deviation shows that a trace
has very small burst periods (as in the case of NLOS-heavy),
it can be used as an indication that per-packet power con-
trol will be highly unpredictable. Finally we observe that all
the scenarios show substantial non-stationarity in RSSI vari-
ations, which will further impede ﬁne grained mechanisms
for power control.
Entropy
Through the empirical analysis presented in Section 2.1, we
observed that due to multipath, fading and other propaga-
tion eﬀects, the RSSI values at the receiver show signiﬁcant
variation (also corroborated by Figure 6). Depending on
the exact environment, RSSI distributions for close trans-
mit power levels can have substantial overlap, making them
practically indistinguishable at the receiver. For a power
control scheme to be eﬀective, it needs to determine the set
of useful power levels i.e. power levels with minimum over-
lap. In order to estimate the number of power levels in any
setting, we need to estimate the corresponding RSSI distri-
bution for various power levels. Ideally, we can sample the
RSSI values for a very long period of time (≈ 10mins) to ob-
tain the true behavior of the RSSI distribution. But, as we
show next, sampling very large number of packets may not
be necessary (or practical, due to computation and storage
limitation on the clients) in most settings. This observation
leads us to the following question: What is the minimum
number of packets we should sample to get a “good”
approximation of RSSI distribution ?
We ﬁrst describe an oﬄine mechanism to determine the
number of samples that are required to generate a distribu-
tion close to the one computed over large number of packets,
Let p(x) and q(x) be two probability distribution func-
tions deﬁned over a common set χ. We describe a commonly
used statistical measure Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD)
that quantiﬁes the ’distance’ or the relative entropy between
two probability distributions. This comprises a general mea-
sure and allows us to compare the statistics of all the orders
for the two distributions. The Kullback-Leibler Divergence
(KLD) [7] is deﬁned as
X
p(x)
x∈χ
˛˛˛˛log
˛˛˛˛
p(x)
q(x)
D(p(x)||q(x)) =
(3)
The KLD is zero when the two distributions are identical
and increases as the distance between two distributions in-
crease. The KLD is a measure used in information theory to
calculate the ’distance’ between two distributions p(x) and
q(x). The deﬁnition of the KLD carries a bias for random
variables with higher entropy. Hence to evaluate the rela-
tive distance accurately for our purposes, it is important to
weigh in the entropy of the original distribution which can
be large. The entropy H(p(x)) of the random variable x
with distribution p(x) is the average length of the shortest
description of the random variable given by:
X
H(p(x)) =
p(x) log
x∈χ

p(x)

Hence we use the normalized Kullback-Leibler divergence
NKLD [14] deﬁned below as a measure of distance between
two distributions
NKLD(p(x)||q(x)) =
D(p(x)||q(x))
H(p(x))
(5)
However the above metric is asymmetric and we make
it symmetric by taking an average of NKLD(p(x)||q(x)) and
NKLD(q(x)||p(x)). The symmetric average distance between
”
two distributions is given by
“
D(p(x)||q(x))
D(q(x)||p(x))
NKLD(p(x), q(x)) =
H(p(x))
H(q(x))

Ideally we could have characterized the distance between
two probability distributions by calculating the area of their
intersection on some data set X. However this will require
calculating their points of intersections and some numerical
integration techniques, which may be cumbersome depend-
ing on the exact shape of the distribution. Hence we use
NKLD as it compares the statistics of all orders for two dis-
tributions and is very simple to compute in real time. Fur-
ther NKLD works eﬃciently for our experimental scenarios.
We consider the long term probability distribution as p(x)
and those derived from our oﬄine mechanism as q(x). Let
n be the length of the packet sequence that is used for com-
puting the distribution q(x). The value of n is varied and we
