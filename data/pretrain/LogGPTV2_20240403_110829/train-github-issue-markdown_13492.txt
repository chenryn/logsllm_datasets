The plotting functions on DataFrames always have grid=True. This overrides
user settings in matplotlibrc.
If you have to created a desired default plot style with the rc file, you want
every plot to show with this style unless otherwise specified.  
Because pandas overrides this setting you have to manually set the grid option
every time.
A better behaviour would be for Pandas not to override any plot styles by
default.
