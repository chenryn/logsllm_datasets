User: For a high-traffic website, what measures would you take to optimize website performance? Please list specific measures in at least three areas.
Assistant: As an AI, I will provide you with specific optimization measures based on the following aspects: 1. Asynchronous loading of resources: When there are a lot of resources such as pictures and videos on the page, asynchronous loading can be used to reduce the loading of the page time. Lazy loading technology can be used, that is, loading is only performed when the user scrolls to the location of the resource, reducing unnecessary resource loading on the page. 2. Use CDN to accelerate: Storing static resources (such as JS, CSS, pictures, etc.) on CDN allows visitors to obtain content through the server closest to them, greatly reducing response time and improving access speed, thereby optimizing website performance . 3. Database optimization: For high-traffic websites, it is necessary to consider how to optimize database query efficiency, such as adding indexes, avoiding full-table queries, and appropriately dividing tables and databases. At the same time, try to avoid frequent database connection and shutdown operations, which can be optimized by using connection pool technology.
