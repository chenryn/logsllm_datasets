operating culture. This efort continues in the Executing Process Phase as the 
OCM Practitioner monitors team dynamics. Figure 2-7 demonstrates the goals 
of Team Dynamics throughout the PMLC. 
Team  Dynamics  activities  in  the  Planning  Process  Phase  serve  todevelop  a 
strong working team as new project team members are identified and involved 
in team activities. Figure 2-8 demonstrates the inputs, roles, skills, activities, 
tools, and outputs for Team Dynamics in the Planning Process Phase.

2.4.3 Activities 
During  the  Planning  Process  Phase,  the  project  team  begins  to  formalize  
and  expand.  It  is  imperative  that  the  project  team  work  together  to  increase  
productivity and create a positive working environment. To support this, the OCM  
Practitioner and Project Manager will conduct a team meeting to review the team  
guidelines in addition to using the Team Dynamics Action Log Template to capture  
and organize tasks, resources, and timeframes for Team Dynamics eforts. 
Conduct Team Guidelines Session 
Project  teams  ofen  consist  of  individuals  from  diferent  backgrounds  and 
diverse working environments. As such, it is important to introduce the project 
team’s behavior guidelines from the team’s initiation. The first step toward a 
shared understanding of team guidelines is to hold a team meeting to introduce 
guidelines and show the Project Manager’s commitment to a positive working 
environment. The OCM Practitioner may help to develop and conduct a Team 
Guidelines Session; however, this activity requires the support and leadership

Inputs 
The following is an  
input to the activity:

introduce and reinforce guidelines. This initial session serves to: 
•   Introduce team guidelines 
•   Reinforce the value of these behaviors from the Project Manager’s perspective 
•   Grant permission to hold other team members, including the Project 
Manager, accountable, as unexpected behaviors do occur 
While this session may seem trivial, it is imperative that the Project Manager 
shows a genuine commitment to the team guidelines. A project team is more 
likely  to  adopt  guidelines  if  the  team  leader  leads  by  example  and  takes  a 
sincere  interest  in  team  dynamics.  In  the  Executing  Process  Phase,  the  OCM 
Practitioner and Project Manager will continue encouraging team members to 
recognize and adopt the team guidelines using surveys and follow up sessions; 
however, if the Planning Process Phase is lengthy, the OCM Practitioner and 
Project  Manager  may  find  it  beneficial  to  begin  Team  Dynamics  activities 
outlined in the Executing Process Phase earlier than prescribed. 
The OCM Practitioner may utilize the Team Dynamics Action Log to record and 
track  all  Team  Dynamics  activities.  This  working  document  allows  the  OCM 
Practitioner to track all Team Dynamics actions, such as the Team Guidelines 
session, throughout the PMLC. It should be reviewed and modified regularly.

The  goals  of  the  Training  Knowledge  Area  as  the  project  moves  through 
the PMLC are shown in Figure 2-9, with the overall goal of ensuring all users 
have the necessary knowledge, skills and abilities (KSAs) to utilize the project 
solution. In the context of the CA-OCM and IT project implementations, end user 
training refers to the training efort needed for all users of a new system. These 
individuals can be leaders, employees, and/or external Stakeholders and each 
group may require a substantial training efort to function with the new system. 
As such, the OCM Practitioner considers the method and approach anticipated 
to  be  necessary  for  the  end  user  training  efort  that  occurs  in  the  Executing 
Process Phase. Planning for end user training is critical to ensure the adequate 
training level of efort has been estimated and enacted.

2.5.1 Inputs 
In  order  to  complete  the  Planning  Process  Phase  Training  activities,  the  OCM  
Practitioner will need a thorough understanding of the following inputs: 
Change  Magnitude  Assessment:  This  assessment  provides  insight  into  the  
relative size of the change, level of readiness for change, and OCM priority areas. 
Stakeholder  Register:   The  Stakeholder  Register,  completed  in  the  Initiating  
Process Phase, as prescribed by the CA-PMF, identifies the individuals with a role  
in the project. This will provide input for the planning of Training activities. 
Project  Schedule:  The  Project  Schedule  describes  what  work  needs  to  be 
performed, which resources of the organization will perform the work, and the 
time frames in which that work needs to be performed.

2.5.3 Activities 
End user training is a critical part of a successful IT implementation project. The 
OCM Practitioner should put suficient thought and planning into the possible 
training methods and approaches. 
Identify Training Method and Approach 
The purpose of end user training is to provide ample opportunity for end users 
to gain the knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) they need in order to use the 
new system. Depending on the scope and complexity of the change initiative, 
the project may at this point in the Planning Process Phase dedicate a resource 
to  develop  and  manage  the  training  efort.  This  role,  the  Training  Lead,  will 
complete the Training Knowledge Area activities with the support of the OCM 
Practitioner.  Some  projects  with  more  simple  training  eforts  or  constrained 
resources  may  choose  to  leverage  the  OCM  Practitioner  to  determine  the 
training method(s) for training delivery.

Planning | Page 37 
California Department of TechnologyOrganizational Change Management FrameworkPlanningTrainingRegardless of the assigned resource, it is important to define the training method  
the project will utilize in order to appropriately plan for the Executing Process  
Phase. Depending on the characteristics of the project, the following two methods  
may be used alone or in combination to provide the necessary training: 
•   Train-the-Trainer Training: In this method, training is provided to a  
designated group of instructors with the intention of preparing them to  
conduct end user training. A main benefit is to train large numbers of  
instructors to reach large populations. The train-the-trainer method is useful  
for situations where there are large end user populations that need training. 
•   Direct End User Training: This method employs the OCM Practitioner 
and/or a designated training team to conduct end user training. As 
opposed to the train-the-trainer approach, the project team is responsible 
for the delivery of training to the end users, instead of using external 
resources who have been selected and trained to do so. This method is 
useful for projects with smaller training needs. 
To  support  the  training  methods  above,  there  are  several  commonly  used 
training  approaches  that  provide  users  with  diferent  training  experiences. 
A  training  program  may  utilize  one  approach,  or  a  combination  of  several. 
Example training approaches are included in the table below.

California Department of TechnologyOrganizational Change Management FrameworkPlanningTrainingA training resource to use in addition to those identified above are Super Users. 
Super Users are individuals selected from within the organization afected by 
the  change  (e.g.,  department,  division,  or  unit)  who  have  the  demonstrated 
technical proficiency to use the system, and the enthusiasm and temperament 
to support and encourage others to adopt the change. They support the end 
users’ use of the new system and are more accessible than a help desk to make 
the change easier. A Super User is generally not a formal position, but rather a 
responsibility that an individual will have in addition to his/her duties. Because 
training  is  a  critical  component  to  the  successful  adoption  and  utilization 
of  the  new  system,  thoroughly  planning  the  training  program  should  not  be 
overlooked in this process phase. 
The OCM Practitioner should collaborate with the Project Manager to provide 
input into the selection of the most suitable methods and approaches for the 
specific  project.  The  OCM  Practitioner  should  utilize  his/her  knowledge  of 
the  organization’s  needs  and  review  project  documents  such  as  the  Change 
Magnitude Assessment, Stakeholder Register, and Project Schedule in order to 
determine the training delivery method(s) that will best fit the expected training 
eforts.  Once  the  OCM  Practitioner  has  identified  the  method  and  approach 
to  training,  the  results  should  be  documented  by  drafing  the  Training  Plan, 
Section 2, Approach. The remainder of the Training Plan will be completed in 
the Executing Process Phase.

Phase Checklist 
3.1   Complete the Checklist 
Once  all  of  the  OCM  activities  within  the  Planning  Process  Phase  are  done, 
the process phase checklist should be completed. Why a checklist? Checklists 
are comprised of a list of questions built around why, how, what, who, where, 
and  when.  These  questions  can  help  verify  whether  everything  required  for 
executing  the  project  is  in  place.  Many  of  these  tasks  are  repeatable  from 
project to project and checklists help document these repeatable steps in order 
to ensure that the correct things are done at the right time, every time. 
A checklist can assist the OCM Practitioner with quickly and confidently identifying  
areas of concern within the Planning Process Phase. In this case, completion of
