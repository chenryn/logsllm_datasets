of 2na entries of nb bits each, and the total table (code)
size T is estimated as (2na × nb) bits. In other words, this
provides weak whitebox security at the level of (2na × nb)
bits [4].
Let us consider the case where a part of the table is leaked,
i.e. i ≤ 2na entries of table are extracted by the attacker,
where the leaked-table size M is (i× nb) bits. The probabil-
ity that a random input of the table is among the extracted
subset of entries is estimated as i/2na (= (i×nb)/(2na×nb)).
Thus, given a random plaintext/ciphertext, the correspond-
ing output after R rounds can be computed with i entries
of the table with a probability of about (i/(2na ))R. Fig. 6
shows this relation between M and Z in terms of (M, Z)-
space hardness for SPACE with R ∈ {25, 64, 96, 128}. This
evaluation is a basic white-box compression attack and its re-
sults should be seen as an upper bound on the actual space
hardness.

5.4.1 Key Recovery
In the black-box model, the attacker is unable to directly
′
na (x) =
msbnb (EK (C0||x)). Hence, a key recovery for SPACE in the
access the inputs and outputs of the internal tables F
black-box setting is at least as complex as a key recovery
for the underlying block cipher. Thus, in the black box,
dedicated distinguishing attacks with possible subsequent
table recovery are of more concern than key recovery attacks.
5.4.2 Generic Attacks
Generic attacks on target-heavy generalized Feistel con-
structions were proposed in [36, 41]. None of these proper-
ties spans more than 47, 23 and 11 rounds of SPACE-8, -16
and -32, respectively.
5.4.3 Differential Cryptanalysis
Here we analyze the diﬀerential properties of an na-bit to
na (x) : {0, 1}na → {0, 1}nb(=n−na).
′
nb-bit function F
Definition 3. The cardinality of a diﬀerential N (a, b)
for a function f is the number of pairs with input diﬀer-
ence a that have output diﬀerence b:
N (a, b) = #{(v, u)|u ⊕ v = a and f (v) ⊕ f (u) = b}
The distribution of N (a, b) over functions has been shown
to be binomial for suﬃciently large na and nb [16, 8].
Lemma 1. [16] For a non-trivial diﬀerential (a, b) with
ﬁxed a and b, the distribution of N (a, b) over na-bit to nb-
bit functions is binomial:
P r(N (a, b) = i) = (2
−nb )i(1 − 2

Assuming that the diﬀerentials over a ﬁxed randomly drawn
permutation have a similar distribution of expected N (a, b)
and using the proof techniques of Theorem 2 in [8], we ob-
tain the following for a random function:

at least 17, 9, 6 and 5 active F-functions after 150, 44, 32
and 14 rounds.
5.4.4 Linear Cryptanalysis
′
Now we analyze the linear properties of the function F
na (x):
{0, 1}na → {0, 1}nb(=n−na).
Given an input mask α and an output mask β, α ∈
{0, 1}na and β ∈ {0, 1}nb , the correlation of a linear ap-
proximation (α, β) for a function f : {0, 1}na → {0, 1}nb is
deﬁned as
Cor = 2
−na [#{x ∈ {0, 1}na|α · x ⊕ β · f (x) = 0} −
#{x ∈ {0, 1}na|α · x ⊕ β · f (x) = 1}.
The linear probability LP of (α, β) is deﬁned as Cor2. LP
′
na (x) is assumed to be normally distributed [16], using
of F
Corollary 1. [16] The linear probability LP of a non-
trivial linear approximation over na-bit to nb-bit functions

The value of 2
−20.5, and
-16, -24 and -32 is estimated as 2
−28.6, correspondingly. In our evaluation, we assume the
2
−4,
maximum linear probabilities of the F-functions to be 2
−12, 2
2
Our search for the minimum number of linearly active F-
functions in SPACE-8, -16, -24 and -32 shows that there are
at least 32, 11, 7 and 5 active F-functions after 33, 12, 10
and 6 rounds.
5.4.5
In SPACE-8, -16, -24 and -32, any input bit non-linearly
aﬀects all state bits after at least 17, 9, 15 and 5 rounds, re-
spectively. Following the miss-in-the-middle approach, after
34 (= 17 × 2), 18 (= 9 × 2), 30 (= 15 × 2), and 10 (= 5 × 2)
rounds, we have not found any useful impossible diﬀerentials
for the respective variants.

5.4.6 Other Attacks
From the results by Suzaki et al. [39], it follows that there
are no useful integral distinguishers after 19, 12, 17 and
10 rounds of SPACE-8, -16, -24 and -32. We have also
considered further attacks including slide, higher order dif-
ferential, truncated diﬀerential, and algebraic attacks. The
details of this evaluation are omitted due to the page limi-
tation. Table 2 shows a summary of our security evaluation
for SPACE-8, -16, -24 and -32.
5.5 Recommended Numbers of Rounds
We conservatively recommend to choose the number R of
rounds to be equal to twice the number of rounds resist-
ing the basic white-box compression attack of Section 5.3.2
at the level of (T /4, 128)-space hardness or twice the num-
