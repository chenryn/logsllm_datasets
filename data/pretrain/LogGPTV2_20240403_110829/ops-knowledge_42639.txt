User: I need to access a smartplug device using socket programming . I have the MAC address and UDP port number of the device . Other information like SSID,password , Apps Id, Dev Id, Cmd ID are also present .
Could you please let me know if this can be achieved using Python or Java API . Is there a way in socket programming to access a device using MAC address and get the information sent from a specific UDP port .
Thanks in advance for your help .
Assistant: You can access the device via a UDP socket, provided you have the IP address of the device as well as the UDP port number.  
Both Java and Python have socket APIs so you can use either one.  Just make sure you follow the network protocol defined by the device to be able to read to / write from the device properly.
