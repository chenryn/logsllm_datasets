User: From my understanding, Celery is a distributed task queue, which means the only thing that it should do is dispatching tasks/jobs to others servers and get the result back. RabbitMQ is a message queue, and nothing more. However, a worker could just listen to the MQ and execute the task when a message is received. This achieves exactly what Celery offers, so why need Celery at all?
Assistant: In my opinion, it's easy to integrate celery with flower and other monitoring packages than RabbitMQ.
It all depends on the use case anyways...
If you don't need other functionalities celery provides, RabbitMQ would be an easy way out. Weighing out your options wouldn't be a bad idea...
