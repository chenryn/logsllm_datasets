Looking at the docs, many fields and structs are under-specified. At some
point (soon) we need to do an audit/scrub of API per-field and per-struct
comments (which generate docs).
  * What is this field?
  * Is this field required? (omitempty is sort of a bad way IMO)
  * What happens if this field is not specified?
  * What are valid values or bounds for this field?
  * What happens if you specify an out-of-bounds value?
  * Does this field have a literal default value (e.g. 42), a derived default value (e.g. same as another field), or no default value (the system will choose a value)?
  * Is this field updateable? What happens if you update it?
