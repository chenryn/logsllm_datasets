Currently multifield mapping support path parameter per property so if you
need to have several fields mapped for a property they will either all have
full path name or just_name
it is rather inconvenient when you want to have the property with say two
secondary fields one with full name (because it only makes sense as a variant
of primary field say not analyzed) and one with just_name because you want to
have an all-like field to which many of your properties contribute.
consider an example (a part of a bigger json)
"category": {"code":"CTZ", "description":"My Description"}
code was indexed as multifield resulting in names  
category.code  
category.code.untouched
later I want to have my_all field to where I want to index category.code as
well as other fields
I will add path:"just_name" to my mapping and another field my_all
that will immediately break my application because untouched will become a
just_name mapping as well and all untouched from all my data elements will be
rolled into it
My current workaround is to provide full name for untouched field
(category.code.untouched) so it retains its full name. I am not sure it is
intentional behavior but it seems to work (need to test it more)
But much cleaner approach would be to allow path per field in multifield
mapping
