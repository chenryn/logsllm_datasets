User: My problem is that when I do :
$ which python 
=> I get /a/b/c/python as my directory
but if I do 
$ sudo which python
=> I get /d/e/python as the result
How do I change the sudo one to match with the normal case, it is making it impossible to install libraries from source.
Assistant: It uses the first one found in $PATH
try doing
echo $PATH
then
sudo bash -c 'echo $PATH'
I bet these are different.
In any case, there is usually an rc script of some sort for the shell you use in both /root and your current user, just rearrange the paths in the environment variable for the one you want.
