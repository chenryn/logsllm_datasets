### Key Findings and Implications

1. **Limited Deployment Effectiveness**: Even a very limited deployment of decoy routers may be sufficient to deter relatively small state-level censors such as Syria from launching the attack.

2. **Regional vs. Global Deployment**: While a global deployment of decoy routing is ideal (e.g., the China-World scenario), even a regional deployment (e.g., only in the U.S., as in the China-US scenario) is effective in defeating the RAD attack. This is an important finding because regional deployment is more practical than global deployment. For example, the U.S. government may mandate or incentivize U.S.-based ASes to deploy decoy routers to support the freedom of the Internet in Syria.

3. **Multi-AS Deployment Requirement**: Any real-world deployment of decoy routing systems requires decoys to be installed in multiple ASes. The networking community has faced similar challenges with the adoption of new networking protocols and technologies. Their solutions [12, 13] can be adapted to the problem of decoy routing. Specifically, techniques proposed for deploying secure BGP protocols may provide inspiration. Gill et al. [12] suggest an initial deployment by "early-adopter" ASes who are incentivized by third parties. This initial deployment will eventually lead to a competition among ASes to install the new technology, as they aim to increase their revenue-generating traffic. Similarly, an initial deployment of decoy routers on a small number of transit ASes, perhaps incentivized by pro-freedom NGOs or governments, can "diffuse" decoy routing to other transit ASes who want to capture a share of the decoy routing traffic.

4. **Data-Driven Approach**: A fine-grained, data-driven approach is necessary for understanding the true costs of various route selection mechanisms. Analysis based solely on the graph topology of the Internet may lead to mistaken conclusions about the feasibility of decoy routing, as well as other censorship circumvention techniques based on Internet routing. Any analysis of decoy routing and alternatives must be based on all available data about individual nodes and links in the Internet connectivity graph.
