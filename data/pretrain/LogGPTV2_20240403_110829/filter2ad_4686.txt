## Abstract
The most common form of user authentication on websites is the use of passwords. When entering a password, it is crucial that the website uses HTTPS for all content. However, this is often not the case. We propose PassSec, a Firefox Add-On designed to help users detect password fields where their password might be at risk. PassSec displays a non-intrusive warning next to the password field when the user clicks into it. The warning provides potential consequences, recommendations, and additional information if desired.

## 1. Introduction
Passwords are the most popular form of user authentication on websites due to their convenience and simplicity. Protecting a user’s password is crucial, especially since many users reuse the same password across different services. If a password is intercepted, it can be reused by an attacker for other services of the victim.

Ideally, a password should only be entered if the server is authentic and the website with the password field uses HTTPS, ensuring all elements are exchanged via HTTPS. This ensures the password is protected from interception. However, many well-known websites do not meet these criteria:
1. Some websites do not encrypt the main page or the password transmission (e.g., http://edition.cnn.com/). In such cases, the password can be easily intercepted.
2. Some websites do not use HTTPS for the main page but encrypt the password transmission (e.g., http://www.gmx.net/). Even if the password is encrypted, the website is still vulnerable to manipulation.
3. Some websites do not encrypt all resources, leading to mixed content issues (e.g., https://hukd.mydealz.de/login or https://www.rtl.de/cms/mein-rtl.html).

Users must check for a padlock or "https://" in the URL to ensure security, which can be cumbersome. Our goal is to support users with PassSec, a Firefox Add-On that checks for suboptimal conditions and changes the background color of the password field to red, adding a yellow warning triangle. If the ideal condition applies, the password field gets a green border and a check mark icon.

PassSec also checks if the website is accessible via HTTPS. When the user focuses on the password field, PassSec displays a dialog with possible consequences, recommendations, and further information. This dialog appears only if the user interacts with the password field, ensuring minimal disruption.

## 2. Content of Dialogs
This section describes the content of scenario-specific warning dialogs. We distinguish between different scenarios, such as logging into a website, setting a password during registration, or changing a password. These scenarios can occur in the situations described above or in the ideal situation where both the main page and password transmission use HTTPS.

### HTTPS Available
- **Short Dialog**: The user is informed that their password could be intercepted and used to access personal data. They are recommended to always open the website in a secure mode (via HTTPS) using the "Always open secured" button.
- **Long Dialog**: Provides more detailed information and the option to learn more about secure password entry and transmission.

### HTTPS Not Available
- **Dialog**: The user is informed that their password could be intercepted and used to access personal data. Since HTTPS is not available, they are encouraged to use different passwords for different websites. The "Trust this website" button allows the user to whitelist the site, but this option is highlighted in red as it is not recommended.

## 3. Related Work
Maurer et al. [3, 4] proposed a similar approach to increase users' security awareness when entering critical information. Their system displays a non-blocking dialog next to the password field, informing the user about the type of information being submitted, the domain of the visited website, and whether the information is transmitted securely. Users can decide to add the website to a whitelist.

## 4. Conclusion and Future Work
We have proposed PassSec, a Firefox Add-On to help users assess the security of their passwords on specific websites. For different scenarios, PassSec provides potential consequences, recommendations, and further information. Using the Add-On can increase users' security awareness regarding the secure entry of sensitive data. Future work includes conducting a field study to analyze user interactions and adherence to our recommendations, such as opening websites via HTTPS or changing passwords on insecure sites.
