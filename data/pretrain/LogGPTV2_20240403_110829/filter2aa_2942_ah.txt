3.4.3. Enhancing Practices 
Enhancing practices should be applied by the enterprise with the goal of advancing toward 
adaptive and predictive C-SCRM capabilities. Enterprises should pursue these practices once 
sustaining practices have been broadly implemented and standardized across the enterprise: 
• Automate C-SCRM processes where applicable and practical to drive execution 
consistency, efficiency, and make available the critical resources required for other 
critical C-SCRM activities. 
• Adopt quantitative risk analyses that apply probabilistic approaches (e.g., Bayesian 
analysis) to reduce uncertainty about the likelihood and impact of cybersecurity risks 
throughout the supply chain, optimize the allocation of resources to risk response, and 
measure return on investment (i.e., response effectiveness). 
• Apply insights gained from leading C-SCRM metrics (i.e., forward-looking indicators) to 
shift from reactive to predictive C-SCRM strategies and plans that adapt to risk profile 
changes before they occur. 
• Establish or participate in a community of practice (e.g., Center of Excellence) as 
appropriate to enhance and improve C-SCRM practices. 
The guidance and controls contained in this publication are built on existing multidisciplinary 
practices and are intended to increase the ability of enterprises to strategically manage 
cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain over the entire life cycle of systems, products, 
and services. Refer to Table 3-3 for a summary of C-SCRM key practices. 
3.5. 
Capability Implementation Measurement and C-SCRM Measures 
Enterprises should actively manage the efficiency and effectiveness of their C-SCRM programs 
through ongoing measurement of the programs themselves. Enterprises can use several methods 
to measure and manage the effectiveness of their C-SCRM program: 
• Using a framework, such as NIST CSF to assess their C-SCRM capabilities 
• Measuring the progress of their C-SCRM initiatives toward completion

• Measuring the performance of their C-SCRM initiatives toward desired outcomes 
All methods rely on a variety of data collection, analysis, contextualization, and reporting 
activities. Collectively, these methods should be used to track and report progress and results that 
ultimately indicate reductions in risk exposure and improvements in the enterprise’s security 
outcomes.   
C-SCRM performance management provides multiple enterprise and financial benefits. Major 
benefits include increasing stakeholder accountability for C-SCRM performance; improving the 
effectiveness of C-SCRM activities; demonstrating compliance with laws, rules, and regulations; 
providing quantifiable inputs for resource allocation decisions; and cost-avoidance associated 
with reduced impact from or the likelihood of experiencing a cyber supply chain incident.  
Enterprises can use a framework to baseline their C-SCRM capabilities, such as NIST CSF 
Implementation Tiers, which provide a useful context for an enterprise to track and gauge the 
increasing rigor and sophistication of their C-SCRM practices. Progression against framework 
topics is measured using ordinal (i.e., 1-5) scales that illustrate the progression of capabilities 
across tiers. The following are examples of how C-SCRM capabilities could be gauged by 
applying NIST CSF Tiers: 
• CSF Tier 1: The enterprise does not understand its exposure to cybersecurity risks 
throughout the supply chain or its role in the larger ecosystem. The enterprise does not 
collaborate with other entities or have processes in place to identify, assess, and mitigate 
cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain. 
• CSF Tier 2: The enterprise understands its cybersecurity risks throughout the supply 
chain and its role in the larger ecosystem. The enterprise has not internally formalized its 
capabilities to manage cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain or its capability to 
engage and share information with entities in the broader ecosystem. 
• CSF Tier 3: The enterprise-wide approach to managing cybersecurity risks throughout 
the supply chain is enacted via enterprise risk management policies, processes, and 
procedures. This likely includes a governance structure (e.g., Risk Council) that balances 
the management of cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain with other enterprise 
risks. Policies, processes, and procedures are consistently implemented as intended and 
continuously monitored and reviewed. Personnel possess the knowledge and skills to 
perform their appointed cybersecurity supply chain risk management responsibilities. The 
enterprise has formal agreements in place to communicate baseline requirements to its 
suppliers and partners. The enterprise understands its external dependencies and 
collaborates with partners to share information to enable risk-based management 
decisions within the enterprise in response to events. 
• CSF Tier 4: The enterprise actively consumes and distributes information with partners 
and uses real-time or near real-time information to improve cybersecurity and supply 
chain security before an event occurs. The enterprise leverages institutionalized 
knowledge of cybersecurity supply chain risk management with its external suppliers and 
partners, internally in related functional areas, and at all levels of the enterprise. The 
enterprise communicates proactively using formal (e.g., agreements) and informal 
mechanisms to develop and maintain strong relationships with its suppliers, buyers, and

other partners. 
Building capabilities begins by establishing a solid programmatic foundation that includes 
enabling strategies and plans, establishing policies and guidance, investment in training, and 
dedicating program resources. Once this foundational capability is in place, enterprises can use 
these progression charts to orient the strategic direction of their programs to target states of C-
SCRM capabilities in different areas of the program. Table 3-3 provides an example C-SCRM 
implementation model.

3.5.1. Measuring C-SCRM Through Performance Measures 
Fig. 3-1: C-SCRM Metrics Development Process 
Enterprises typically rely on information security measures to facilitate decision-making and 
improve performance and accountability in their information security programs. Enterprises can 
achieve similar benefits within their C-SCRM programs. Additionally, enterprises should report 
C-SCRM metrics to the board through the ERM process. Figure 3-1 illustrates the process for 
developing metrics, as outlined in [NIST SP 800-55, Rev. 1] and which includes: 
• Stakeholder Interest Identification: Identify the primary (e.g., CISO, CIO, CTO) and 
secondary C-SCRM stakeholders (e.g., CEO/Head of Agency, COO, CFO), and 
define/measure requirements based on the context required for each stakeholder or 
stakeholder group.  
• Goals and Objectives Definition: Identify and document enterprise strategic and C-
SCRM-specific performance goals and objectives. These goals may be expressed in the 
form of enterprise strategic plans, C-SCRM policies, requirements, laws, regulations, etc. 
• C-SCRM Policies, Guidelines, and Procedure Review: Identify the desired C-SCRM 
practices, controls, and expectations outlined within these documents and used to 
guide/implement C-SCRM across the enterprise.  
• C-SCRM Program Implementation Review: Collect any existing data, measures, and 
evidence that can provide insights used to derive new measures. These may be found in 
C-SCRM Plans, POA&Ms, supplier assessments, etc. 
• Level of Implementation: Develop and map measures to the identified C-SCRM 
standards, policies, and procedures to demonstrate the program’s implementation

progress. These measures should be considered when rendering decisions to prioritize 
and invest in C-SCRM capabilities.  
• C-SCRM Program Results on Efficiency and Effectiveness: Develop and map 
measures of C-SCRM’s efficiency and effectiveness to the identified strategy and policy 
objectives to gauge whether desired C-SCRM outcomes are met. These measures should 
be considered part of policy refreshes. 
• Business and Mission Impact: Develop and map measures to the identified enterprise 
strategic and C-SCRM-specific objectives to offer insight into the impact of C-SCRM 
(e.g., contribution to business process cost savings; reduction in national security risk). 
These measures should be considered a component of goal and objective refreshes.  
Similar to information security measures, C-SCRM-focused measures can be attained at different 
levels of an enterprise. Table 3-4 provides example measurement topics across the three Risk 
Management levels.

Enterprises should validate identified C-SCRM goals and objectives with their targeted 
stakeholder groups prior to beginning an effort to develop specific measures. When developing 
C-SCRM measures, enterprises should focus on the stakeholder’s highest priorities and target 
measures based on data that can be realistically sourced and gathered. Each established measure 
should have a specified performance target used to gauge whether goals and objectives in 
relation to that measure are being met. Enterprises should consider the use of measures templates 
to formalize each measure and serve as a source of reference for all information pertaining to that 
measure. Finally, enterprises should develop a formal feedback loop with stakeholders to ensure

that measures are continually providing the desired insights and remain aligned with the 
enterprise’s overall strategic objectives for C-SCRM.  
3.6. 
Dedicated Resources 
To appropriately manage cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain, enterprises should 
dedicate funds toward this effort. Identifying resource needs and taking steps to secure adequate, 
recurring, and dedicated funding are essential and important activities that need to be built into 
the C-SCRM strategy and implementation planning effort and incorporated into an enterprise’s 
budgeting, investment review, and funds management processes. Access to adequate resources is 
a critical, key enabler for the establishment and sustainment of a C-SCRM program capability. 
Where feasible, enterprises should be encouraged to leverage existing fund sources to improve 
their C-SCRM posture. The continued availability of dedicated funds will allow enterprises to 
sustain, expand, and mature their capabilities over time.    
Securing and assigning C-SCRM funding is representative of leadership’s commitment to the 
importance of C-SCRM, its relevance to national and economic security, and ensuring the 
protection, continuity, and resilience of mission and business processes and assets.   
Funding facilitates goal and action-oriented planning. Examining resource needs and allocating 
funding prompts a budgeting and strategic-planning process. Effective enterprises begin by 
defining a set of goals and objectives upon which to build a strategic roadmap, laying out the 
path to achieving them through the assignment and allocation of finite resources. The 
establishment of dedicated funding tied to C-SCRM objectives sets conditions for accountability 
of performance and compels responsible staff to be efficient, effective, and adopt a mindset of 
continuously seeking to improve C-SCRM capabilities and achieve security enhancing 
outcomes. 
Obtaining new or increased funding can be a challenge as resources are often scarce and 
necessary for many competing purposes. The limited nature of funds forces prioritization. C-
SCRM leaders need to first examine what can be accomplished within the constraints of existing 
resources and be able to articulate, prioritize, and defend their requests for additional resources. 
For new investment proposals, this requires a reconciliation of planned initiatives against the 
enterprise’s mission and business objectives. When well-executed, a systematic planning process 
can tighten the alignment of C-SCRM processes to these objectives.  
Many C-SCRM processes can and should be built into existing program and operational 
activities and may be adequately performed using available funds. However, there may be a need 
for an influx of one-time resources to establish an initial C-SCRM program capability. For 
example, this might include the need to hire new personnel with expertise in C-SCRM, acquire 
contractor support to aid in developing C-SCRM program guidance, or develop content for role-
based C-SCRM training. There may also be insufficient resources in place to satisfy all recurring 
C-SCRM program needs. Existing funds may need to be reallocated toward C-SCRM efforts or 
new or additional funds requested. Enterprises should also seek out opportunities to leverage 
shared services whenever practical.

The use of shared services can optimize the use of scarce resources and concentrate capability 
into centers of excellence that provide cost-efficient access to services, systems, or tools. 
Enterprises can adopt cost-sharing mechanisms across their lower-level entities that allow cost-
efficient access to C-SCRM resources and capabilities. Enterprises that pursue shared-services 
models for C-SCRM should also be aware of the challenges of such models. Shared services 
(e.g., C-SCRM PMO) are most effective when the enterprise at large relies on a fairly 
homogenous set of C-SCRM strategies, policies, and processes. In many instances, the 
centralized delivery of C-SCRM services requires a robust technology infrastructure. The 
enterprise’s systems should be able to support process automation and centralized delivery in 
order to fully realize the benefits of a shared-services model.  
 Consultation with budget/finance officials is critical to understanding what options may be 
available and viable in the near term and out-years. These officials can also advise on how best 
to justify needs, as well as the timeframes and processes for requesting new funds. There are 
likely different processes to follow for securing recurring funds versus requesting one-time 
funding. For example, funding for a new information system to support a C-SCRM capability 
may involve the development of a formal business case presented to an enterprise’s investment 
review board for approval. Organizations may find it helpful to break out resource needs into 
ongoing and one-time costs or into cost categories that align with budget formulation, resource 
decision-making, and the allocation and management of available funds.   
It is recommended that the C-SCRM PMO have the lead responsibility of coordinating with 
mission and business process and budget officials to build out and maintain a multi-year C-
SCRM program budget that captures both recurring and non-recurring resource requirements and 
maps those requirements to available funding and fund sources. To understand the amount of 
funding required, when, and for what purpose, enterprises should identify and assess which type 
and level of resources (people or things) are required to implement a C-SCRM program 
capability and perform required C-SCRM processes on an ongoing basis. The cost associated 
with each of these identified resource needs would then be captured, accumulated, and reflected 
in a budget that includes line items for relevant cost categories, such as personnel costs, 
contracts, training, travel, tools, or systems. This will provide the enterprise with a baseline 
understanding of what can be accomplished within existing resource levels and where there are 
gaps in need of being filled. The actual allocation of funds may be centralized in a single C-
SCRM budget or dispersed across the enterprise and reflected in individual office or mission and 
business process-area budgets. Regardless of how funds are actually assigned, a centralized 
picture of the C-SCRM budget and funds status will provide a valuable source of information 
that justifies new requests, informs prioritization decisions, and adjusts expectations about 
certain activities and the duration in which they can be accomplished.  
Ensuring that C-SCRM program funding is distinctly articulated within the enterprise’s budget –
with performance measures linked to the funding – will drive accountability for results. The 
visible dedication of funds in budget requests, performance plans, and reports compels leadership 
attention on C-SCRM processes and the accomplishment of objectives. Budgets must be 
requested and justified on a periodic basis. This process allows leadership and oversight officials 
to trace and measure the effectiveness and efficiency of allocated resources. This, in turn, serves
