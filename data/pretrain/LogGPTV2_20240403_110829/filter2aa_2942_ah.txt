### 3.4.3. Enhancing Practices

To advance towards adaptive and predictive Cyber Supply Chain Risk Management (C-SCRM) capabilities, enterprises should implement the following enhancing practices after sustaining practices have been broadly implemented and standardized across the organization:

- **Automation of C-SCRM Processes:** Where feasible, automate C-SCRM processes to ensure consistent execution, enhance efficiency, and free up critical resources for other essential C-SCRM activities.
- **Quantitative Risk Analysis:** Adopt quantitative risk analyses, such as Bayesian analysis, to reduce uncertainty about the likelihood and impact of cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain. This approach optimizes resource allocation for risk response and measures the return on investment (ROI) in terms of response effectiveness.
- **Predictive Strategies:** Leverage leading C-SCRM metrics (forward-looking indicators) to transition from reactive to predictive C-SCRM strategies. This shift enables the enterprise to adapt to changes in the risk profile before they occur.
- **Community of Practice:** Establish or participate in a community of practice, such as a Center of Excellence, to enhance and improve C-SCRM practices.

The guidance and controls provided in this publication are based on existing multidisciplinary practices and aim to enhance an enterprise's ability to strategically manage cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain over the entire lifecycle of systems, products, and services. For a summary of key C-SCRM practices, refer to Table 3-3.

### 3.5. Capability Implementation Measurement and C-SCRM Measures

Enterprises should actively manage the efficiency and effectiveness of their C-SCRM programs through ongoing measurement. Several methods can be used to measure and manage the effectiveness of C-SCRM programs:

- **Framework Assessment:** Use a framework like the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) to assess C-SCRM capabilities.
- **Progress Tracking:** Measure the progress of C-SCRM initiatives toward completion.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Evaluate the performance of C-SCRM initiatives against desired outcomes.

These methods rely on various data collection, analysis, contextualization, and reporting activities. Collectively, these methods should be used to track and report progress and results, ultimately indicating reductions in risk exposure and improvements in the enterprise’s security outcomes.

**Benefits of C-SCRM Performance Management:**
- Increased stakeholder accountability for C-SCRM performance.
- Improved effectiveness of C-SCRM activities.
- Compliance with laws, rules, and regulations.
- Quantifiable inputs for resource allocation decisions.
- Cost avoidance associated with reduced impact or likelihood of experiencing a cyber supply chain incident.

**NIST CSF Implementation Tiers:**
Enterprises can use the NIST CSF Implementation Tiers to baseline their C-SCRM capabilities. The tiers provide a context for tracking and gauging the increasing rigor and sophistication of C-SCRM practices. Progression is measured using ordinal scales (1-5) that illustrate the progression of capabilities across tiers. Examples include:

- **Tier 1: Initial**
  - The enterprise does not understand its exposure to cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain or its role in the larger ecosystem. No collaboration or processes exist to identify, assess, and mitigate cybersecurity risks.
  
- **Tier 2: Informed**
  - The enterprise understands its cybersecurity risks and role but lacks formalized internal capabilities to manage these risks or engage with entities in the broader ecosystem.
  
- **Tier 3: Repeatable**
  - An enterprise-wide approach to managing cybersecurity risks is enacted via risk management policies, processes, and procedures. A governance structure balances the management of cybersecurity risks with other enterprise risks. Policies and processes are consistently implemented and monitored. Personnel are trained, and formal agreements with suppliers and partners are in place.
  
- **Tier 4: Adaptive**
  - The enterprise actively consumes and distributes information with partners, using real-time or near real-time data to improve cybersecurity and supply chain security. Institutionalized knowledge of C-SCRM is leveraged internally and externally, and strong relationships with suppliers, buyers, and other partners are maintained.

### 3.5.1. Measuring C-SCRM Through Performance Measures

Figure 3-1 illustrates the process for developing C-SCRM metrics, as outlined in [NIST SP 800-55, Rev. 1], which includes the following steps:

- **Stakeholder Interest Identification:** Identify primary and secondary C-SCRM stakeholders and define/measure requirements based on each stakeholder's context.
- **Goals and Objectives Definition:** Document enterprise strategic and C-SCRM-specific performance goals and objectives.
- **C-SCRM Policies, Guidelines, and Procedure Review:** Identify desired C-SCRM practices, controls, and expectations outlined in relevant documents.
- **C-SCRM Program Implementation Review:** Collect existing data, measures, and evidence to derive new measures.
- **Level of Implementation:** Develop and map measures to demonstrate the program’s implementation progress.
- **Efficiency and Effectiveness:** Develop and map measures to gauge the efficiency and effectiveness of C-SCRM.
- **Business and Mission Impact:** Develop and map measures to offer insight into the impact of C-SCRM on business and mission objectives.

Table 3-4 provides example measurement topics across the three Risk Management levels.

### 3.6. Dedicated Resources

To effectively manage cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain, enterprises must dedicate funds to this effort. Identifying resource needs and securing adequate, recurring, and dedicated funding are essential activities that should be integrated into the C-SCRM strategy and implementation planning, as well as the enterprise’s budgeting, investment review, and funds management processes.

**Key Points:**

- **Leadership Commitment:** Securing and assigning C-SCRM funding demonstrates leadership’s commitment to the importance of C-SCRM and its relevance to national and economic security.
- **Resource Allocation:** Effective resource allocation facilitates goal-oriented planning and ensures accountability and continuous improvement in C-SCRM capabilities.
- **Challenges and Solutions:** Obtaining new or increased funding can be challenging due to resource scarcity. C-SCRM leaders should prioritize and justify requests for additional resources. Leveraging shared services and cost-sharing mechanisms can optimize the use of scarce resources.
- **Budget and Planning:** Consultation with budget and finance officials is crucial for understanding available options and justifying funding needs. The C-SCRM PMO should coordinate with mission and business process and budget officials to build and maintain a multi-year C-SCRM program budget.
- **Accountability and Performance:** Ensuring that C-SCRM program funding is distinctly articulated in the enterprise’s budget, with performance measures linked to the funding, drives accountability and compels leadership attention on C-SCRM processes and the achievement of objectives.

By following these guidelines, enterprises can effectively manage and measure their C-SCRM programs, ensuring robust and adaptive cybersecurity risk management throughout the supply chain.
