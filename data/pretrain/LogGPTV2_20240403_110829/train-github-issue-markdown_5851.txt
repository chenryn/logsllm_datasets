I'm not hugely familiar with CLI standards, but I don't think I've ever run in
to the requirement that --flags precede the positional arguments. I spent a
long while trying to get `--allow-net` to work before realising this was
necessary.
`deno run --allow-net something.ts` vs `deno run something.ts --allow-net`
Is there any reason not to support both forms?
Alternately, a warning that the arguments were being ignored as invalid would
have helped me understand.
