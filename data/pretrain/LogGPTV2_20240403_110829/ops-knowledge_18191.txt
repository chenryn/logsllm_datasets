User: How can I completely uninstall Anaconda from MacOS Sierra and revert back to the original Python? I have tried using conda-clean -yes but that doesn't work. I also remove the stuff in ~/.bash_profile but it still uses the Anaconda python and I can still run the conda command.
Assistant: None of these solutions worked for me. Turns out I had to remove all the hidden files that you can reveal with ls -a My .zshrc file had some anaconda references in it that needed to be deleted
