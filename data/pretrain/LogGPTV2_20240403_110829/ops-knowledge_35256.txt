User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题TFS DB and Recovery Model. Is Simple Safe On my TFS database server all the databases are set to Full Recovery Model. We don't do any log shipping and just do full db backups each night so would there be any impact to TFS is we changed our recovery model to Simple? (the log files are getting really large)

Thank you,

Assistant: Your TFS data is at risk. Your current backup is not sufficient to guarantee a restore of your TFS environment.

As TFS consists of more than one database (at least tfs_configuration and tfs_collection) there can be transactions that span those databases. Since transactions are not final until complete on a single DB you can get corruption. If you restore to a point in time one db could not have finished the transaction and roll back, while the other completes.

This will cause the TFS restore to fail.

You must follow the manual backup procedure detailed the documentation to be guaranteed a restore.

Or you can use the built in backup tool in the TFS Administration Console.

NOTE: The SQL Databases, their configuration, and TFS configuration is owned by TFS and should not be changed beyond what has been documented by the product team.
