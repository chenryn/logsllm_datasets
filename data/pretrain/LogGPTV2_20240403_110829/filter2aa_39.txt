### 1. Why Target Travelers?
- **Communication Over Privacy and Security:** Travelers often prioritize communication over privacy and security.
- **Trusting Unknown Internet Access:** The need for internet access leads travelers to trust public Wi-Fi, which they might normally avoid.
  - **WiFi Usage:**
    - Logging into (corporate) email accounts
    - Accessing social networks
    - Using multiple devices simultaneously (mobile phones, tablets, laptops)
    - Frequent use of public internet hotspots without second thoughts

### 2. Point-of-Sale Attacks in Transportation
Unlike traditional POS attacks in commerce (e.g., the Target incident), which target:
- Credit card details
- Web credentials

We focus on international travelers' information:
- Name
- Picture
- Flight number
- Destination
- Seat number
- Communication partners
- Other personal data

### 3. How is the POS Introduced?
As with any known POS attack (retail, healthcare, etc.):
1. **Unpatched Vulnerabilities:** The system may have unpatched vulnerabilities.
2. **Employee Mistakes:** An employee of the victim company may introduce malware by opening an email attachment.
3. **Insider Threats:** A disgruntled employee may intentionally introduce malware.

### 4. POS Attack Outcome
- **Beneficiaries:**
  - Cyber Criminals (identity theft)
  - Private Investigators (spying)
  - Government Agencies (spying)

- **Achievements:**
  - Unauthorized traveler profiling
  - Categorization of travelers based on:
    - Destination
    - Company
    - Class (e.g., first class or business)
    - Flight/Date
    - Combinations of the above

### 5. POS Systems of Interest
- Check-in kiosks
- Purchase WiFi time kiosks
- Internet Access Points (Terminals)
- Luggage Locator kiosks

### 6. Case Study: An International Airport in Greece
- **Estimations:**
  - Annual travelers: 12 million
  - Business passengers: 3.6 million (30%)
  - Business passengers using POS: 36,000 (1%)
  - January-March 2014 passenger traffic: 2.4 million

- **Purchase WiFi Time Kiosks:**
  - Services:
    - Buy extra WiFi time (accepts coins and bills, gives change)
    - Check flight details (barcode/QR scanner)
    - Make internet phone calls (VOIP) (webcam available)
  - Placement: 6 kiosks in high-traffic areas

### 7. Back to the Lab
**Objective:**
- Develop a malware to install in the kiosk that:
  - Exploits the webcam module
  - Has RAM scrapping functionality
  - Retrieves scanned e-ticket details
  - Receives barcode commands

- Develop a tool that:
  - Fuzzes the barcode scanner to expose errors
  - Provides commands to the malware

**Outcome:**
- Inspiration for the Travelers Spy (TS) POS malware
- Creation of the Aztec Revenge Tool (Android Mobile App)

### 8. Camera Module Exploitation
- **Purpose:**
  - "Eyes" inside the airport (multiple spots, requires connect back)
  - Capture users' facial images without consent during ticket scan events (full profiling)

### 9. Barcode Scanner and Privacy Issues
- **Barcode Scanning:**
  - Scans e-tickets and retrieves traveler details
  - Does not log scans
  - Scanned barcode info decoded and present in RAM
  - Network calls containing traveler information
  - Ticket formats tested: BCBP (bar-coded boarding pass), Aztec (popular with e-tickets)

### 10. TS POS Malware
**Features:**
- Runs in the background
- Performs RAM scrapping to identify already scanned e-tickets
- Captures images through the webcam on e-ticket scan events
- Hooks on the barcode scanner process if possible
- Receives commands through Aztec Code images
- Connects back if internet connectivity is available

### 11. Aztec Revenge Tool
- **Modes of Operation:**
  - E-ticket Duplicator Mode
  - PENTEST Mode (Fuzzer)
  - MALWARE COMMAND Mode

- **Use Cases:**
  - Impersonation
  - Fuzzing parameters expected by the system
  - Issuing commands via Aztec Code images

### Conclusion and Recommendations
**Recommendations:**
1. Use strong passwords to access POS devices.
2. Keep POS software up to date.
3. Use firewalls to isolate the POS production network from other networks or the internet.
4. Employ antivirus tools.
5. Limit internet access from the production network.
6. Disable all remote access to POS systems.
7. Regularly check software and hardware of POS systems to discover and patch vulnerabilities.
