4 Windows Service
This chapter shows how to set up and manage the 
Windows file service in Mac OS X Server.
General Information
Windows services in Mac OS X Server provide four native services to Windows clients:
• File service allows Windows clients to connect to the server using Server Message 
Block (SMB) protocol over TCP/IP
• Print service uses SMB to allow Windows clients to print to PostScript printers on the 
network
• Windows Internet Naming Service (WINS) allows clients across multiple subnets to 
perform name/address resolution
• Browsing allows clients to browse for available servers across subnets
This chapter shows how to set up the Windows service for file sharing.
Windows services use the Windows code page setting to display the correct language 
for the client. 
Samba is public-domain software that provides file and print services to Windows 
clients. For more information about Samba, visit www.samba.org:
Windows File Services Specifications
• Maximum number of connected users, depending on your license agreement:  1000
• Maximum volume size:  2 terabytes 
• TCP port number:  139
• UDP port numbers:  37, 138
• Log file location:   /Library/Logs in the WindowsFileServices folder

Chapter 4    Windows Service
Before You Set Up Windows Services
If you plan to provide Windows services from Mac OS X Server, read the following 
sections for issues you should keep in mind. You should also check the Microsoft 
documentation for your version of Windows to find out more about the capabilities of 
the client software. Although Mac OS X Server does not require any special software or 
configuration on Windows client computers, you may want to read “Supporting 
Windows Clients” on page 66.
Ensuring the Best Cross-Platform Experience
Mac OS and Windows computers store and maintain files differently. For the best cross-
platform experience, you should set up at least one share point to be used only by your 
Windows users. See “Creating a Share Point and Setting Privileges” on page 22.
In addition, you can improve the user experience by following these guidelines:
• Use comparable versions of application software on both platforms.
• Modify files only with the application they were created in.
• If you have Mac OS 8 and Mac OS 9 clients, limit Windows file names to 31 characters.
• Don’t use symbols or characters with accents in the names of shared items.
Windows User Password Validation
Mac OS X Server supports several methods of validating Windows user passwords. 
Password Server is the recommended method. It supports LDAP as well as NetInfo 
because the directory does not store the password, just a pointer to the proper 
Password Server and user ID. The Password Server database is a private root readable 
file, and the contents are encrypted. Passwords are not accessible over the network for 
reading—they can only be verified.
Authentication Manager is supported for upgrades from Mac OS X Server version10.1. 
Existing users will continue to use Authentication Manager. (If you export from 
Mac OS X Server and reimport, you do not get the tim_password set. You must 
manually set the password for each user after import.) You can enable Authentication 
Manager from the command line. Use Basic password validation. You should set 
Authentication Manager passwords on the server hosting the domain you are editing.
Note:  Authentication Manager is only supported with NetInfo.

Setting Up Windows Services
You set up Windows services by configuring four groups of settings:
• General  Specify your computer name and workgroup name, and choose the role of 
the server in associated Windows domains.
• Access  Limit the number of clients and control guest access.
• Logging  Choose how much information is recorded in the service log.
• Advanced  Configure WINS registration and domain browsing services, choose a 
code page for clients, and control virtual share points for home directories.
Because the default settings work well in most cases, it may be that all you need to do 
is start the Windows service. Nonetheless, you should take a look at the settings and 
change anything that isn’t appropriate for your network. Each settings is described in 
the following sections on configuration. Following the configuration tasks, other topics 
tell you how to start up Windows services.

Chapter 4    Windows Service
Changing General Settings
You can use the General pane of the Windows service settings in Server Admin to 
provide a server description, name, and workgroup and specify the server’s role in its 
domain. 
To configure Windows service General settings:
1 Open Server Admin and select Windows in the Computers & Services list.
2 Click Settings, then click General. 
3 To specify how your server participates in the local domain, choose from the Role pop-
up menu.
4 In the Description field, type a description that is meaningful to you or your users. 
This description appears in the Network Neighborhood window on client computers, 
and is optional.
The Description cannot exceed 48 characters.
5 In the Computer Name field, type the server name you want users to see when they 
connect.
The default name is the NetBIOS name of the Windows file server. The name should 
contain no more than 15 characters, and no special characters or punctuation.
If practical, make the server name match its unqualified DNS host name. For example, if 
your DNS server has an entry for your server as “server.apple.com,” give your server the 
name “server.”
6 In the Workgroup field, type the name of the workgroup that you want users to see in 
the Network Neighborhood window. 
If you have Windows domains on your subnet, use one of them as the workgroup 
name to make it easier for clients to communicate across subnets. Otherwise, consult 
your Windows network administrator for the correct group name. 
The workgroup name cannot exceed 15 characters.
From the Command Line
You can also change the Windows service settings by modifying the serveradmin 
command in Terminal. For more information, see the file services chapter of the 
command-line administration guide.
