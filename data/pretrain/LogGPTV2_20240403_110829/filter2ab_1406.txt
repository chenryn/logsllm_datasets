**ATT&CK ID:** T0846  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Remote System Discovery

Adversaries may attempt to enumerate other systems on a network by identifying their IP addresses, hostnames, or other logical identifiers. This information can be used for subsequent Lateral Movement or further Discovery activities. Adversaries may leverage built-in functionality within their tools, or they may use standard utilities and vendor software available on the operating system to achieve this.

### Key Points:
- **Objective:** Identify and list other systems on the network.
- **Identifiers:** IP addresses, hostnames, or other logical identifiers.
- **Purpose:** Facilitate Lateral Movement or additional Discovery techniques.
- **Tools and Utilities:** 
  - Built-in functionality in adversary tools.
  - Standard utilities and vendor software available on the operating system.

This technique allows adversaries to map out the network and identify potential targets for further exploitation.
