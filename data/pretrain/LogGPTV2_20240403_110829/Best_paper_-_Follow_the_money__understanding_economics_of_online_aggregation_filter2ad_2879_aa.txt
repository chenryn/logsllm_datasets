## Abstract
The large-scale collection and exploitation of personal information to drive targeted online advertisements has raised significant privacy concerns. To better understand these concerns, we examine the relationship between the amount of information collected and its value for advertising. We use HTTP traces from millions of users to aid our study and present the first comparative analysis among different aggregators. We develop a simple model that captures various parameters of today's advertising revenues, estimated through the traces. Our results show that revenue per aggregator is highly skewed (5% accounting for 90% of revenues), while the contribution of users to advertising revenue is less skewed (20% accounting for 80% of revenue). Google is dominant in terms of both revenue and reach (present on 80% of publishers). If the top 5% of revenue-generating users were to install privacy protection without any corresponding reaction from publishers, the revenue could drop by 30%.

## 1. Introduction
Online advertising plays a critical role in the Web ecosystem today. Most Web services, such as search, social networks, and email, are offered for free to end users and rely on revenues generated by online advertising. While extensive research has been conducted on various aspects of online advertising, including mechanisms, privacy concerns, and click spam, little is known about the economics of collecting and using personal information for targeted advertising.

Understanding the relationship between personal information and its economic value can shed light on debates around privacy and network economics. This understanding can highlight information vectors that lead to higher revenues, the users who supply these vectors, and their impact on online privacy. Network economics literature has not yet fully considered the revenues generated for Web services by users via ads, and a fine-grained characterization can lead to better models and a more accurate understanding of the flow of money.

Our key contribution is characterizing advertising revenue as a function of users' information used to drive online advertising, specifically how much information different parties collect and the value of this information to them. We begin by developing a model of online advertising revenue based on discussions with advertising professionals and literature (Section 2). Our model includes content-hosting publishers, users browsing content, and aggregators tracking these users across publishers. We then perform a data-driven analysis using our model to study today's advertising ecosystem, using multiple large Web traces (Sections 3-4). The unique nature of our traces also allows us to compare different aggregators, which is impossible to do by studying the clickstream of a single aggregator. To highlight the utility of understanding revenues as a function of information, we investigate what would happen to revenues if users were to adopt a privacy solution such as do-not-track (DNT), and show why such unilateral actions will not be supported by Web services (Section 5).

### Main Findings
- **Today's Advertising Ecosystem:**
  - Google is a dominant player in the online ad industry, with presence on 80% of publishers in our datasets, generating the highest revenues as an aggregator but not the top publisher in terms of revenue. Facebook is increasing its presence with the 'Like' button, reaching 23% of publishers.
  - A few aggregators account for most of the revenue (5% accounting for 90% of revenues), while users' contribution to advertising revenue is less skewed (20% accounting for 80% of revenue).
  - Popular publishers account for the highest revenues, while less popular ones have low revenues.

- **Impact of DNT/Blocking:**
  - There can be up to a 75% drop in ad revenues if blocking is near-total, without any repercussions from aggregators (Section 5).
  - Just the top 5% of users (in terms of revenue contribution) blocking is enough to decrease the advertising revenue by 30%.

## 2. Online Advertising Model
Online aggregators collect information to increase advertising effectiveness. We focus on the following entities in the online advertising ecosystem:

### 2.1 Online Advertising Entities
- **Users (U):** Access Web content and services, often for free.
- **Publishers (P):** Host content and services provided free-of-charge to users. Publishers gain revenue by selling space on their Web pages to advertisers. Examples include nytimes.com and slate.com.
- **Aggregators (A):** Map advertisers to the most effective Web page placements based on the content of the Web site and any information they have about users viewing the page. Aggregators track user behavior using Web-bugs, cookies, and analytics. Examples include DoubleClick (owned by Google) and Facebook, which tracks users via the "Like" button. Some large aggregators, like Google, also host content (e.g., YouTube) and can be publishers.

### 2.2 The Role of Users
In an implicit exchange for free services, users contribute to advertising revenue by viewing advertisements when they visit a publisher. We denote the number of visits a user \( u \) makes to publisher \( p \) as \( \mu_u(p) \). Each visit produces impressions that may be sold to advertisers.

### 2.3 Revenue for Publishers and Aggregators
Aggregators and publishers share advertising revenue generated by displaying ads on Web sites. We assume the aggregator retains a constant fraction of the advertising revenue (\( \alpha \)) and passes the remaining amount to the publisher. For example, Google AdSense keeps \( \alpha \sim 0.32 \).

We consider ad revenue on a "cost-per-mille" (CPM) basis, which is the primary method of purchasing targeted display ads. The CPM depends on the user \( u \), ad network \( a \), and publisher \( p \):

\[
\text{CPM}(u, p, a) = \text{RON}_a \times \text{TQM}_p \times I_a(u)
\]

- **Run-of-network (RON\(_a\)):** The base price for an impression in ad network \( a \). A RON ad is a generic ad shown to users about whom little is known and may be shown on any affiliated publisher. The CPM for a targeted ad can be 2-10 times the price of a normal RON ad.
- **Traffic Quality Multiplier (TQM\(_p\)):** A multiplier of the impression price that captures the quality of the publisher, ad location, and hence the value of the impression.
- **User Intent \( I_a(u) \):** The value of an impression increases as a function of the estimated purchasing intent of the user. Aggregators segment users based on their interests, inferred through online tracking. Certain segments are determined to have higher purchasing intent, and these users' impressions are worth more. We use implicit intent \( \text{II}_a(u) \) to represent the intent value an aggregator can infer about a user, which naturally depends on the presence of the aggregator on the sites the user visits. We distinguish this from explicit intent \( \text{EI}(u) \), which is computed with knowledge of all sites the user visits. Implicit intent is capped by explicit intent.

The total revenue of the online advertising ecosystem is:

\[
R = \sum_{u \in U} \sum_{p \in P} \sum_{a \in A} \frac{\mu_u(p)}{1000} \times \text{CPM}(u, p, a)
\]

## 3. Data Analysis Methodology
We use traces of HTTP traffic in multiple networks to study advertising in relation to information gathered from users. While having access to an aggregator or a publisher's clickstream would aid our study, it would provide only a partial view. Our approach uses anonymous and aggregated data, ensuring no personally identifiable information is gathered or used.

### Table 1: Summary of Data Sets
| Trace | Setting | Users | Country | Sessions |
|-------|---------|-------|---------|----------|
| HTTP  | Neighborhood A (4/2011) | ∼ 5K | Country | 40M |
| mHTTP | Neighborhood B (8/2011) | ∼ 3M | Country | - |
| Univ   | Campus (9/2010) | ∼ 8K | Campus | - |

This comprehensive analysis provides a deeper understanding of the economics of online aggregation and advertising, highlighting the importance of user information and the potential impacts of privacy measures.
