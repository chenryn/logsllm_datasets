ABSTRACT
The large-scale collection and exploitation of personal infor-
mation to drive targeted online advertisements has raised
privacy concerns. As a step towards understanding these
concerns, we study the relationship between how much in-
formation is collected and how valuable it is for advertising.
We use HTTP traces consisting of millions of users to aid our
study and also present the ﬁrst comparative study between
aggregators. We develop a simple model that captures the
various parameters of today’s advertising revenues, whose
values are estimated via the traces. Our results show that
per aggregator revenue is skewed (5% accounting for 90%
of revenues), while the contribution of users to advertising
revenue is much less skewed (20% accounting for 80% of
revenue). Google is dominant in terms of revenue and reach
(presence on 80% of publishers). We also show that if all
5% of the top users in terms of revenue were to install pri-
vacy protection, with no corresponding reaction from the
publishers, then the revenue can drop by 30%.

INTRODUCTION
Online advertising plays a critical role in the Web ecosys-
tem today. Most Web services1 are oﬀered for free to end
users and these Web services operate by relying on revenues
generated by online advertising. A lot of work has been done
on diﬀerent facets of online advertising: whether it be under-
standing the mechanisms used for advertising [25], privacy
concerns [13] or combating click spam [10]. However, little
is known about the economics of online advertising, chieﬂy
the economics of collecting and using personal information
of users for facilitating targeted advertising.
Understanding the relationship between personal informa-
tion and its economic value sheds light on debates around
privacy and network economics. Economics of online ad-
vertising can highlight information vectors that can lead to
higher revenues, the users who supply these vectors and its
impact on online privacy. Network economics literature has
not considered revenues generated for Web services by the
users via ads and a ﬁne-grained characterization can lead
to better models and accurate understanding of the ﬂow of
money [19].
Our key contribution is characterizing advertising revenue
as a function of users’ information that is used to drive on-
line advertising, speciﬁcally how much information do dif-
ferent parties collect, and the value of this information to
them. We begin by developing a model of online advertising
revenue based on discussions with advertising professionals
and literature [16, 6] (Sec. 2). Our model includes content-
hosting publishers, users browsing content and aggregators
tracking these users across publishers. We then perform a
data-driven analysis using our model to study today’s adver-
tising ecosystem, using multiple large Web traces (Sec. 3- 4).
The unique nature of our traces also lets us compare diﬀer-
ent aggregators – impossible to do by studying the click-
stream of a single aggregator. To highlight the utility of
understanding revenues as a function of information, we in-
vestigate what would happen to revenues if users were to
adopt a privacy solution such as do-not-track (DNT), and
show why such unilateral actions will not be supported by
Web services (Sec. 5). Our main ﬁndings include:

with highest revenues as an aggregator but is not the top
publisher in terms of revenue, and Facebook is increasing its
presence around the Web with their ‘Like’ button, reaching
23% of publishers, (b) a few aggregators account for most
of the revenue (5% accounting for 90% of revenues), how-
ever, users’ contribution to advertising revenue is much less
skewed (20% accounting for 80% of revenue) and (c) popular
publishers account for highest revenues, while less popular
ones have low revenues.
DNT/Blocking can decrease overall revenue by 75%.
We learn that there can be up to 75% drop in ad revenues
if blocking is near-total, without any repercussions from ag-
gregators (Sec. 5), and just the top 5% of users (in terms
of revenue contribution) blocking is enough to decrease the
advertising revenue by 30%.
2. ONLINE ADVERTISING MODEL
The reason stated by online aggregators for collecting in-
formation is to increase advertising eﬀectiveness. Hence, we
focus on online advertising.
2.1 Online advertising entities
The online advertising ecosystem consists of three main
entities2:
Users (U) access Web content and services. We focus on
content and services the user accesses for free.
Publishers (P) host content and services that are pro-
vided free-of-charge to users. Publishers gain revenue by
selling space on their Web pages to advertisers. Examples
include nytimes.com and slate.com.
Aggregators (A) map advertisers to the most eﬀective
Web page placements based on content of the Web site and
any information they have about users viewing the page. To
facilitate this process, aggregators track user behavior using
a combination of Web-bugs, cookies, analytics etc.(see [18]
and references therein).
Examples include DoubleClick (owned by Google) and
more recently Facebook that tracks users (for social pur-
poses) via the ubiquitous “Like” button [26]. Some large
aggregators like Google also host content (e.g., Youtube),
hence can be publishers as well.
2.2 The role of users
In an implicit exchange for free services, users contribute
to advertising revenue by viewing advertisements when they
visit a publisher. We denote the number of visits a user
u makes to publisher p as µu(p). Each visit a user makes
to a Web page produces impressions that may be sold to
advertisers.
2.3 Revenue for publishers and aggregators
Aggregators and publishers share advertising revenue gen-
erated by displaying ads on Web sites. We assume the aggre-
gator retains a constant fraction of the advertising revenue
(α) and passes the remaining amount on to the publisher.
2The actual online ad ecosystem is staggeringly complex
with multiple entities (e.g., data management and demand-
side platforms) http://www.liesdamnedlies.com/online_
advertising_business_101.html. We want to understand
relation between information and monetization at a ﬁrst or-
der approximation and so ignore the full chain.
Google AdSense, for instance, keeps α ∼ 0.32 [21]. (We use
this value in the paper.)
We consider ad revenue on a “cost-per-mille” (CPM) (i.e.,
price for 1,000 ad impressions) basis as this is the primary
method of purchasing targeted display ads [16]. Our model
can be extended to handle cost-per-click (CPC) but this is
left for future work. The amount an advertiser will pay for
impressions depends on user u, ad network a and publisher
p.
CP M (u, p, a) = RONa × T QMp × Ia(u)
(1)
Run-of-network (RONa). RONa is the base price for an
impression in ad network a. A RON ad is a generic ad that
is shown to users about whom little is known and may be
shown on any publisher that a is aﬃliated with [6]. It has
been observed that CPM for a targeted ad can go anywhere
between 2-10X the price of a normal RON ad [16].
Traﬃc quality multiplier (T QMp). T QMp is a multi-
plier of the impression price that captures the quality of the
publisher, ad location and hence the value of the impression.
User Intent Ia(u).
The value of an impression in-
creases as a function of the estimated purchasing intent of
the user. Currently, aggregators segment users based on
their interests [5], as inferred through online tracking. Cer-
tain segments are determined to have higher purchasing in-
tent (e.g., cell phone shoppers) and these users’ impressions
are worth more. This relative value, in turn, is reﬂected in
the price that ad-networks charge for reaching these users
via keywords and/or bid values.
We use implicit intent IIa(u) to represent the intent value
an aggregator can infer about a user. It naturally depends
on the presence of an aggregator on the sites the user visits.
We distinguish this from explicit intent EI(u) that is com-
puted with knowledge of all sites the user visits. Consider
the example: user Bob visits (espn.com, swimming.com,
pets.com). Aggregator A is present on the ﬁrst two pub-
lishers, while aggregator B is present on the third one. Im-
plicit intent for aggregator A about Bob would be limited to
Bob being interested in sports, while for aggregator B, it is
that Bob is interested in pets. The explicit intent EI(u) is
that Bob is interested in sports and pets. We assume that
IIa(u) ≤ EI(u); implicit intent is capped by explicit intent.
We note that while having longitudinal data helps in getting
more accurate estimates of user intent, an aggregator would
need to be present on all publishers to accurately estimate
explicit intent EI(u).
The total revenue3 then of the online advertising ecosys-
tem is the following:

3. DATA ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY
We use traces4 of HTTP traﬃc in multiple networks to
study advertising in relation to information gathered from
the users. While having access to an aggregator or a pub-
lisher’s clickstream would aid our study, it would provide
