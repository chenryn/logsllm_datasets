Hello,
when I am adding firebase dependency to my electron project and importing to
main.js as:  
`import firebase from 'firebase';`
It is replicable in electron-quick-start project as well, just add firebase
dependency and import the firebase module.
It crashes during the application load with the error:
> App threw an error during load  
>  Error: Failed to load gRPC binary module because it was not installed for
> the current system  
>  Expected directory: electron-v7.1-darwin-x64-unknown  
>  Found: [node-v64-darwin-x64-unknown]  
>  This problem can often be fixed by running "npm rebuild" on the current
> system
npm rebuild doesn't help...
Any ideas how to solve this? I am using last version of electron and the last
version of firebase:  
"electron": "^7.1.7"  
"firebase": "^7.6.1"
