Hello,

I'm encountering an issue when adding the Firebase dependency to my Electron project. Specifically, after importing Firebase in `main.js` as follows:

```javascript
import firebase from 'firebase';
```

The application crashes during the load process with the following error message:

```
App threw an error during load
Error: Failed to load gRPC binary module because it was not installed for the current system
Expected directory: electron-v7.1-darwin-x64-unknown
Found: [node-v64-darwin-x64-unknown]
This problem can often be fixed by running "npm rebuild" on the current system
```

Running `npm rebuild` does not resolve the issue.

### Details:
- **Electron Version:** `^7.1.7`
- **Firebase Version:** `^7.6.1`
- **Environment:** macOS (Darwin)

I have also tested this in a fresh `electron-quick-start` project, and the same issue occurs after adding the Firebase dependency and importing the Firebase module.

Does anyone have any suggestions on how to resolve this? Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you!
