If you define a class that has a property which only has a setter, but not a
getter, and then attempt to use the non-existent getter the code will compile,
but the getter is undefined, leading to a crash when it is used. For example:
    class MyClass {
        private theCount: number;
        constructor() {
            this.theCount = 5;
        }
        public set count(i: number) {
            this.theCount = i;
        }
    }
    window.onload = () => {
        var obj: MyClass = new MyClass();
        obj.count = 12;
        var num: number = obj.count;
        document.getElementById("content").innerHTML = num.toString();
    };
The above will compile, but crashes when reading obj.count.  
Surely it would be better if this code did not compile.
