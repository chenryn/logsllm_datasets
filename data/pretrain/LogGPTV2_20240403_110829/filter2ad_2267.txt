ABSTRACT
The advancements in the Information and Communica-
tion Technologies (ICTs) have introduced new computing
paradigms (e.g., cloud computing, pervasive and ubiqui-
tous computing, ambient intelligence and aware-computing)
where the techniques for processing, storing, communicat-
ing, sharing, and disseminating information have radically
changed. These novel computing paradigms bring enormous
beneﬁts: the availability of a universal access to data; the
reduction in power, storage, hardware, and software costs;
and the availability of elastic storage and computation ser-
vices. While these advantages are appealing, as a side eﬀect
there is a tremendous risk of exposure of conﬁdential or sen-
sitive information to privacy breaches. WPES is a yearly
forum, this year at its 15th edition, aiming at discussing the
open privacy challenges, emerging directions, and original
novel approaches for guaranteeing privacy in today’s global
interconnected society.

INTRODUCTION
The collection and use of personal data are becoming ubiq-
uitous: every action we perform and every transaction we
start produce data that are collected, stored, exchanged,
communicated, and shared with multiple third parties in
the digital infrastructure. The amount of data related to,
for example, our communications with family, friends, and
colleagues, our interests, and our personal life (e.g., photos
and videos) available through the network is escalating. Al-
though this scenario brings signiﬁcant beneﬁts, it has the
drawback of leaving private data exposed: users lose control
of what information others know or collect about them, how
it is used, and how and to whom it is disclosed. Also, the
advances in ICT, including the possibility of combining and
analyzing more information from several data sources, in-
tensify the privacy problem. Security and privacy problems

caused by the widespread use of technology are therefore re-
ceiving growing attention, not only from the research and
industrial communities, but also from legislators and gov-
ernments, as well as from single ﬁnal users.
WPES aims to bring together researchers and practition-
ers who are interested in discussing on privacy issues arising
in the electronic society. The workshop encourages partic-
ipation by experts both in the technological aspects of pri-
vacy, and in related ﬁelds (e.g., law and business), thus es-
tablishing a bridge among these communities. WPES repre-
sents an opportunity for researchers to share their ideas and
results, to discuss about new technological trends and the
security and privacy issues they may cause, and to draw new
research directions in the security and privacy domain. Like
past editions, WPES is held in conjunction with ACM Com-
puter and Communications Security (CCS) conference, the
ﬂagship annual conference of ACM SIGSAC (Special Inter-
est Group on Security, Audit and Control). The co-location
of these two events brings advantages to both, as well as to
the community itself. WPES complements ACM CCS with
a speciﬁc forum on privacy, which a crucial aspect of secu-
rity, at the same time beneﬁting from the presence of a wide
audit interested in information security.
The workshop solicited submissions from academia and in-
dustry presenting novel research on all theoretical and prac-
tical aspects of electronic privacy, as well as experimental
studies of ﬁelded systems. The workshop also encouraged
submissions from other communities such as law and busi-
ness that present these communities’ perspectives on tech-
nological issues. Topics of interest for paper submission in-
cluded, but were not limited to:
• anonymization and transparency
• crowdsourcing for privacy and security
• data correlation and leakage attacks
• data security and privacy
• data and computations integrity in emerging scenarios
• electronic communication privacy
• economics of privacy
• information dissemination control
• models, languages, and techniques for big data protec-
tion
• personally identiﬁable information
• privacy-aware access control
