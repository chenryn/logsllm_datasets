**Do you want to request a _feature_ or report a _bug_?**
Feature.
**If this is a feature request, what is motivation or use case for changing
the behavior?**
webpack-cli does a lot of neat things, but it's huge, has a huge dependency
list, and I don't personally need _any_ of its features other than a tiny CLI
that takes args and passes them to a webpack compiler. It's also annoying to
have to remember to install an additional dependency for each web project.
Would you consider providing an extremely minimal CLI within the webpack
package itself, which simply parsed args and sent them to a webpack instance?
Everyone would still be free to use webpack-cli if they want/need, but no one
would be forced to install an extremely large tool just to call webpack from
the command line.
