# Bug report
**What is the current behavior?**
Destructuring DefinePlugin variables causes runtime error `Uncaught
ReferenceError: process is not defined`
**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**
  1. have DefinePlugin plugin defined in the webpack config like this:
      plugins: [
        new webpack.DefinePlugin({
          'process.env.NODE_ENV': JSON.stringify(process.env.NODE_ENV)
        })
      ]
  2. try to access `NODE_ENV` via destructuring: `const { NODE_ENV } = process.env;`
  3. you get runtime failure `Uncaught ReferenceError: process is not defined`
However!
if you access NODE_ENV like `const NODE_ENV = process.env.NODE_ENV;` instead
of `const { NODE_ENV } = process.env;` you don't get runtime error and
everything works like expected.
**What is the expected behavior?**
Both ways of accessing the variable should be equal and should not cause
runtime error.
It is pretty confusing and hard to debug problem and also problematic due to
widely used `prefer-destructuring` eslint rule.
