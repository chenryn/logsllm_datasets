User: According to the following description, a tool solution for monitoring large-scale distributed systems is provided. The system consists of hundreds of servers, running a large number of microservices, and the services depend on each other. It is necessary to monitor the real-time status and performance indicators of the services, such as request response time, throughput, and error rate. At the same time, it is necessary to perform distributed tracing, locate faults and performance bottlenecks, and perform capacity planning and early warning for the system.
Assistant: One possible solution is to use an open source distributed tracing system such as Zipkin or Jaeger for distributed tracing, collecting system performance indicators and request tracing data. Through the visual interface, you can view the topology and dependencies of the entire system, and monitor and analyze the status of services in real time. At the same time, open source indicator collection tools such as Prometheus and Grafana can be used to regularly collect and visualize performance indicators. Combined with the early warning system, through setting thresholds or anomaly detection algorithms based on machine learning, potential problems of the system can be discovered in time and capacity planning can be carried out. In addition to basic monitoring and alerting strategies, custom rules need to be formulated to identify business-specific problems and exceptions and handle them accordingly. The above solutions can realize comprehensive monitoring, analysis, diagnosis and optimization of large-scale distributed systems.
