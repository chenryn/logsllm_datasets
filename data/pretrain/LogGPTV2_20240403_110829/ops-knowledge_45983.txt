User: Bascially, I want an easy(ish), cross-platform way of colouring text in the command line/shell.
I would really like this to not involve importing a module, but because cross-platform support is pretty complicated, I know it will probably have to.
I don't need it to be too elaborate though, just a few basic colours will do.
Assistant: You'll have to use a module if you want something cross-platform / slightly complicated.
I'd recommend using pypi.python.org/pypi/colorama, which is cross-platform.
