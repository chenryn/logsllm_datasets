managed, closely monitored, and often have their OS hard-
ened, meaning that unnecessary and potentially vulnerable
services are disabled. Secondly, as we saw in Section 4 most
of the malware that we observe propagate using indirect
methods (e.g. drive-by-downloads, phishing) that involve
the user and exploit his negligence, rather than initiating
direct attacks, like scanning or buﬀer overﬂow attacks.
Moreover, out of a total of 91 thousand distinct active
hosts we observed during the 9-month period, approximately
9% exhibited signs of infections at least once during their
lifetime, whereas the total number of infections (including
nodes that were re-infected) was 12,915. The number of
nodes exhibiting re-infections was 675, corresponding to less
than 1% of the entire active population. The majority of
these nodes were connected to highly dynamic subnets in
our network, corresponding to student labs and recreation
areas, which are not heavily monitored. These are mostly
private laptops without administrative restrictions on the
installed applications and services. Therefore, the attack
vector of these machines is broader, which is reﬂected on
the increased probability of reinfection.

Infections Impact: Figure 5 illustrates the impact of
an infection on the number of monitored inbound attacks.
We count the average number of alerts classiﬁed as attacks
targeting hosts in our intranet in an hourly basis, for all
healthy hosts, for infected hosts prior to their infection, and
infected hosts after their infection. Note, that based on our
heuristic the infection time is estimated only after the actual
infection manifests. If a node is infected but the correspond-
ing malware remains dormant, it will not generate a mali-
cious footprint on the network, and thus we cannot detect
it. Therefore, in Figure 5, this type of nodes are considered
to be in the pre-infection phase.
In the median case, healthy nodes and nodes in the pre-
infection phase appear to be targets of approximately 3 at-
tacks per hour on average. These are mostly reconnaissance
attacks, such as scanning, that could be precursors of a more
serious attack. The corresponding number of inbound at-
tacks in the case of infected hosts is more than double and
equal to 7. However, if we observe the tails of the distri-
butions we see a much more sharp change. For the top 5%
targets of external attacks we see that in the case of healthy
nodes and nodes in the pre-infection phase we record at least
5 and 9 inbound attacks per hour on average respectively.
However, in the case of infected hosts this number rises to
more than 50 inbound attacks per hour.
We learn that infections drastically increase the attrac-
tiveness of infected hosts to further inbound attacks. We
speculate that this is because most malware also operate as
backdoors, allowing the installation of additional malicious
code. In this way they increase the attack vector of the in-
fected host making it a much more attractive target. This
is especially true for servers, which dominate the tail of the
distributions shown in Figure 5.

Heavy Hitters: From the large pool of active clients, a
small percentage of hosts are popular sources and targets of
attacks, as shown in Figure 6. Regarding the attack popular-
ity distribution we see that the median number of recorded
inbound attacks is equal to 60 per hour. However, this num-
ber increases signiﬁcantly for a small set of internal nodes
that are targets to up to 970 attacks per hour. Almost, all
the servers in our infrastructure are within this highly ex-
posed set. This indicates that servers are much more prefer-
able targets than clients. The reason is that most malicious
pieces of self-spreading software have an initial hit-list of
possibly vulnerable hosts. These hit-lists are generated us-
ing either scanning or by employing web-spiders and DNS-
searches [49]. The inclusion of the public servers in our
37infrastructure in such hit-lists might have increased the vol-
ume of inbound attacks.
The same skewed behavior is observed in the case of the
attack source distribution. We observe that approximately
5% of the internal hosts account for more than 70% of the
total recorded attacks originating from the intranet. These
are highly suspicious nodes that require additional investi-
gation. Blocking or better defending against these systems
can signiﬁcantly reduce the number of recorded extrusions,
safeguarding at the same time exposed internal nodes. The
outbound attack count could act as a crude indicator of
possible malicious activity and combined with our heuris-
tic it can facilitate administrators in focusing their eﬀorts
and identifying top oﬀenders within their premises.

Figure 7: Infections spatial correlation
Spatial Correlations: The infections we observe exhibit
strong spatial correlation. We deﬁne IP distance as the ab-
solute diﬀerence between the integer representation of two
IP addresses. For each host that remains healthy through-
out the tracing period, we measure its IP distance to the
closest infected host. For each host that becomes infected,
we measure its IP distance to the nearest infected host at
the time of infection. In Figure 7, we plot the Cumulative
Distribution Function (CDF) of the IP distance for healthy
and infected hosts. Note that in our infrastructure we use
two large blocks of IP addresses, which explains the sharp
increase we see for IP distance values above 2,600.
We observe that infected hosts are consistently in very
close proximity with other infected hosts. 80% of these hosts
have at least one other infected host in an IP distance which
is less than 200, meaning that they are likely located in
the same subnet. The corresponding percentage for healthy
hosts considering the same IP distance value is signiﬁcantly
lower, equal to 15%.
The presence of strong spatial correlations indicates that
certain subnets within a network are weak links. Hosts close
to existing infections are much more likely to become infected
in the future. Observing clusters of infections should guide
administrators to review and revise the deployed baseline
defenses and security policies.
Correlations Across Time: The infection points exhibit
diurnal patterns as illustrated in Figure 8 where it is shown
that most of the infections occur during working hours. This
is due to the fact that client nodes, which dominate the
infections set, exhibit strong diurnal patterns. This eﬀect

series.
