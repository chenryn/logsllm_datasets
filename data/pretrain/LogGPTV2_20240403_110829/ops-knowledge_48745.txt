User: Please give a schematic diagram of a typical network topology, including the layout and connection methods of network devices such as routers, switches, and firewalls
Assistant: Unfortunately, because I am an AI language model, I can't provide pictures, but I can describe it for you in words: Assume an enterprise internal network topology, which is roughly as follows: Upstream link: 1. The line connecting the enterprise to the ISP is connected through two Cisco ASR1000 series routers Access to the Internet, which is filtered by two ASA 5500 firewalls. Among them, the router adopts two hot backups to ensure the reliability and fault tolerance of the connection. Core switch: 2. The upper and lower layers of core switches (Cisco Nexus 9000 series) are connected to each other. As the core nodes of the enterprise network, they have strong communication processing capabilities and QoS performance. Each switch needs to be connected to two routers. Ensure the reliability of power supply and the stability of the physical environment. Aggregation switch: 3. Aggregation switches (Cisco Catalyst 9000 series) serve as the downlink of the core switch, which aggregates access switches at all levels and optimizes traffic distribution to achieve high network performance. Access switches: 4. Access switches are generally divided into 3 layers: floor switches (Cisco Catalyst 2960 series), computer room switches (Cisco Catalyst 3850 series) and distribution frame switches (Cisco Catalyst 9300 series). The floor switch is connected with the boundary firewall (Cisco ASA 5500 series), and undertakes the access and switching tasks of terminal devices such as PCs. The switch in the computer room is used as the hub device in the middle layer of the network to connect rack servers (Cisco UCS series) and other devices. The distribution frame switch connects the lower layer equipment to complete the fiber jumping task. Firewall: 5. As an important guarantee for secure interconnection performance, firewalls are generally divided into boundary firewalls (Cisco ASA 5500 series) and internal firewalls (Cisco Firepower series) to prevent illegal intrusion and protect enterprise information security. The above is a typical enterprise internal network topology structure, and the layout location and connection method need to be flexibly adjusted according to the actual situation to meet the needs of enterprise network business operations.
