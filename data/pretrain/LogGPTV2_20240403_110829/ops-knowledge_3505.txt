User: I have a simple script I wrote, and when trying to run it (F5) , I get this msg:

================== RESTART: C:\Users\***\Desktop\tst.py ==================

I restarted the shell, reopened the script, but still, the same msg appears.
I use python 3.5.1 and I tried to simplify the script as much as possible, but I still get this result. Now my script is only one line with a simple print(1) command and I still get this msg.
Was there something wrong with the shell installation?
Assistant: The same thing is happening with my shell. In the older versions, this does not happen. I've also noticed that when I press Python 3.5.2 Module Docs, I have my Internet browser open up and I see my directory being displayed onscreen. It looks like:
C:\Users\mycomputername\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python35-32\DLLs.
Is that suppose to happen? Is that secured? I don't know.
I've also found that this prints out whenever I "imported" something. So if I use an import command, and put it right before the line of my random name, it will print out that "RESTART" thing. It's always at the beginning. Or what it reads as the beginning.
