Question: "Consider a C program running on a 32-bit system that performs various operations such as declaring constants, allocating memory dynamically, and executing functions. Which of the following statements correctly describe the operations or data associated with each section of the program's address space?"
 "A": "The code section is where the program's constants are stored and remain unchanged throughout its execution."
 "B": "The stack is used for storing dynamically allocated data that can grow in size as more memory is allocated using functions like `malloc`."
 "C": "Local variables and the data pertaining to function calls are stored in the stack, which grows downwards as more functions are called."
 "D": "Static variables are placed in the heap section, which expands upwards when memory is allocated during runtime."
