User: I am undergoing Udacity's Web Development course which uses Google AppEngine and Python. 
I would like to set up specific user roles, and their alloted permissions. For example, I may have two users roles, Employer and SkilledPerson, and assign their permissions as follows:
Only Employers may create Job entities.
Only SkilledPerson may create Resume and JobApplication entities.
How do I do this?
How do I define these user roles?
How do I assign a group of permissions to specific roles?
How do I allow users to sign up as a particular role (Employer or SkilledPerson)?
Assistant: You must manage user_profile yourself. In your user_profile, you can store the user id such as an email address or a google user id like you want. Add a role array in this entity where you store all roles for this user and you manage access with decorators.
For example, users which are employers will have "EMPLOYERS" in their roles and you manage access to the job creation handler with a @isEmployer decorator.
With this solution, you can assign many roles for you user like "ADMIN" in the future.
