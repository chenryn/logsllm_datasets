Question: A security consultant is reviewing the Content Security Policy of a web application and comes across the following CSP header configuration:

HTTP
Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'nonce-r4nd0m'; object-src 'none'; base-uri 'none';


Which of the following statements accurately reflects a potential vulnerability in this CSP configuration?
"A": "The CSP does not restrict the sources for CSS, which could expose the application to style-based injection attacks.",
"B": "The use of the 'nonce-r4nd0m' value for script-src eliminates the risk of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks completely.",
"C": "The object-src directive set to 'none' unnecessarily restricts the loading of objects, leading to reduced functionality.",
"D": "Setting the base-uri directive to 'none' prevents the application from defining a base URI, which could lead to HTML base tag injection attacks."
Answer: A
