User: I am trying to use logrotate to rotate logs for a multi-process python service. Which of the following combination is commonly used (right and safe)?

WatchedFileHandler + logrotate with create option
OR
FileHandler + logrotate with copytruncate option

Option-1 seem to be used in openstack nova and glance projects. I have not seen option-2 being used. Will option-2 work as expected?. Are there any drawbacks with these approaches when used for multi-process apps?
Assistant: I would suggest using Python's own log rotation to get the best integration. The only drawback is that you have an additional place to configure the details.
