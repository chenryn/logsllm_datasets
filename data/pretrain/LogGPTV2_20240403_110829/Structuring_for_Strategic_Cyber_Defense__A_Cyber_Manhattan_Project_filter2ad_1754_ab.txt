problems.  (2)  Economically,  we  can  make  a  national 
business  case  for  investing  in  a  program  intended  to 
avoid the expected financial losses from strategic cyber 
attacks and ensure the proper public–private sharing of 
the  burden.  (3)  Operationally,  we  can  manage  the 
complex 
judicious  use  of 
automation with a capable cadre of defenders. Through 
a  combination  of  reasonable  fire-code-like  cyber 
security standards, improved operational guidance, and 
trained/experienced personnel, we would also be able 
to contain mission and cost impacts in the short term 
while  we  develop  new  capabilities.  (4)  Politically, 
public awareness of the threat is likely to make needed 
investments  and  standards  acceptable.  Industry  is 
increasingly aware that nation-state-level attacks are a 
concern beyond its current ability to handle, yet such 
attacks threaten business continuity and the economic 
foundation of the entire country. With proper financial 
incentives  and  partnering  for  workable  solutions, 
industry  is  likely  to  openly  embrace  government 
involvement  and  protection.  (5)  Finally,  from  a

objectives,  we  need  a  top-down  architecture  that 
establishes  concrete  cyber  defense  capabilities  on  a 
specific 
timeline, 
including  near-term  capabilities 
within three years. 
The cyber vulnerabilities in our infrastructures have 
become deeply embedded and widespread through the 
economic  forces  that  drive  individual  companies  to 
reduce costs by adopting the most widely available and 
interoperable technologies. It won’t be easy to develop 
a cyber infrastructure that can resist strategic attacks: it 
will  require  short-term  actions  as  well  as a long-term 
plan and a willingness to keep that plan in focus over a 
number of years.  
4. Strategic Cyber Capabilities Needed 
and 
Computer 
In  the  context  of  this  work,  a  capability  is  the 
ability to defend cyber space in some specific fashion. 
Some  cyber  defense  capabilities  to  include  in  a 
strategic  national  plan  are  as  follows:  (1)  system 
resiliency and quick recovery from partially successful 
attacks;  (2)  a  national  cyber  Command,  Control, 
Communication, 
Intelligence, 
Surveillance,  and  Reconnaissance  (C4ISR)  system  to 
measure  and  control  mechanisms  at  multiple  echelon 
levels; (3) a national threat assessment system to drive 
decisions at some “required” level; (4) cyber firebreak 
mechanisms  and  architectures  to  slow  down  attacks 
and  reduce  potential  damage;  (5)  methods  to  gather 
intelligence  and  inject  uncertainty  through  strategic 
deception;  (6)  models  and  simulations  of  the  enemy, 
thereby  honing  our  defenses  before 
incurring 
damaging  strategic  cyber  attacks;  and  (7)  approaches 
for 
identifying  and  understanding  available  and 
acceptable  responses  from  technical,  strategic,  legal, 
economic, and political perspectives.  
As  a  step  toward  a  security  research  plan  that 
includes  such  capabilities,  we  should  identify  end-
states—goals in terms of how we want our systems to 
ideally  operate.  This  fresh  perspective  includes  the 
overall  strategic  picture  and  connects  clearly  with 
strategic  actions  that  significantly  mitigate  strategic 
vulnerabilities.  If,  for  example,  the  nation  has  a 
capability  to  quickly  recover  its  critical  information 
infrastructure, then the end-state is that strategic attack 
damages are mitigated and critical services are restored 
quickly, possibly deterring adversaries from attempting 
a future attack.

So,  using  these  models,  we  need  a  quick-start 
(within 
presidential 
administration’s start) special projects office (SPO) of 
a  hand-picked  mix  of 
top-talent  engineers  and 
computer  scientists  as  well  as  economists,  political 
scientists, and sociologists, to initiate the programs that 
will provide a national strategic cyber defense. 
A  SPO  model  is  recommended  because  it  can 
receive  special  authorities  and  launch  quickly  within 
an  existing  government  infrastructure.  A  model  that 
starts a new mission by creating a bureaucracy leads to 
a three-year-delay, as we’ve seen with examples such 
as the creation of DHS. We must start with a SPO—
call it the National Cyber SPO—to work out the best 
ideas and processes and then institutionalize them.

metrics, it’s hard to judge progress and assess 
the  effectiveness  of  proposed  solutions. 
Metrics are fundamental. 
5. Organizing for Success 
5.1. The Right Organizing Models—NASA and 
DARPA 
Strategic  cyber  defense  to  avert  catastrophically 
damaging  attacks  will  take  careful  orchestration  of 
many  government  (for  example,  DHS,  DoD,  the 
intelligence  community,  Department  of  Treasury, 
Department  of  Energy,  Department  of  Commerce, 
Department  of  State,  and  Department  of  Justice)  and 
private-sector  organizations 
infrastructure 
providers).  
(critical 
A  Manhattan-Project-style  comprehensive  program 
will  require  a  high-talent,  focused,  agile  group  with 
presidential budgetary authority. This is the only way it 
will  succeed.  The  group  will  have  to  orchestrate 
planning, engineering, operations, and research toward 
strategic national cyber defense capabilities. 
To achieve the goal of the proper characteristics of 
a  leading  organization,  we  take  inspiration  from  the 
Defense  Advanced  Research  Project’s  Agency 
(DARPA)  and  the  National  Aeronautics  and  Space 
Administration (NASA).  
DARPA  is  an  elite  team  of  some  of  the  country’s 
best  researchers,  leading  large  programs  that  change 
the world—200 program managers execute a budget of 
$3  billion  per  year,  creating  technology  such  as  the 
Internet.  DARPA  has  exceptional  authorities  such  as 
the  ability  to  hire  top  talent  (using,  for  example,  the 
Intergovernmental  Personnel  Act  [IPA])  and  “other 
transaction”  authority 
into  commercial 
contracts for exceptional staff to do exceptional things. 
DARPA was created in response to Russia’s launch of 
Sputnik, 
its  mission  became  “to  avoid 
technological  surprise.”  We’ve  seen  the  equivalent 
launch  of  cyber  space  “Sputniks”  from  Russia  and 
China in recent years, so the creation of a similar entity 
makes good sense. 
to  enter 
NASA started out as a special projects office with 
presidential support. Such support became particularly 
strong  under  President  Kennedy,  with  his  goal  of 
putting “a man on the moon by the end of the decade.” 
Once the right people were in place, the right processes 
and 
5.3. The Right Place—Above the Fray 
this 
Both  DARPA  and NASA have strong connections 
to the DoD culture (although NASA’s predecessor was 
an  independent  advisory  committee  reporting  to  the 
president), so one option would be to start the SPO in 
the  DoD.  Culturally,  the  DoD  isn’t  focused  on 
defending  the  homeland  and  it  still  doesn’t  see  cyber 
space as a place of intrinsic primary values (money is 
now  just  bits  in  computers,  for  example);  rather,  it

for 
prosecuting physical war. This culture will eventually 
change  as  more  and  more  leaders  understand  the 
primacy of cyber space. We simply can’t wait for this 
change to become pervasive in the DoD. 
territory  as  a  support  element 
Furthermore,  the  execution  of  a  major  cyber 
initiative requires the coordination and orchestration of 
many  agencies,  none  of  which  would  want  to  be 
dominated  by  the  other.  Naming  one  of  the  agencies 
the lead agency wouldn’t create the ideal environment. 
Thus, it makes sense to create the SPO in the White 
House as a temporary measure of expediency. 
5.4 The Right Clout—Presidential Backing 
The  next  president  should  be  100%  behind  the 
program and show continued support and interest and 
grant  it  the  A-1  resource  priorities  given  to  such 
programs  as  the  Manhattan  Project.  The  president 
should hold the initiative up as one of his crown jewels 
and continue to keep its vision in front of the American 
people and keep the staff motivated. Housing the SPO

in  the  White  House  would  enhance  and  contribute  to 
this connection. 
4.5 The Right Authority—Power of the Purse 
It would be impractical and undesirable to pull out 
all 
the  cyber-related  organizations  from  myriad 
agencies  executing  a  piece  of  the  program  into  one 
institution.  The  existing  bureaucracies  are  needed  to 
effectively  execute 
the  broader  national  priority 
program.  Creating  a  matrix  management  structure 
might  be  useful,  but  ultimately  the  authority  to 
coordinate  comes  from  the  power  of  the  purse—the 
authority to control budget.  
So,  any  new  money  associated  with  executing  the 
program should be put under the control of the SPO in 
that  it  would  have  approval  authority  over  those
