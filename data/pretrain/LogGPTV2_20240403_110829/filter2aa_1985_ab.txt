 Some protocols allow you to check the remote 
system’s clock 
 Clock difference could be an issue 
 Minor clock issues may need statistical analysis

 Attack can be hard to pull off because of network

Matadata is data about data

JPG  
EXIF (Exchangeable image file format) 
IPTC (International Press Telecommunications Council) 
PDF 
DOC 
DOCX 
EXE 
XLS

PNG 
Too many to name them all 
Things stored: User names, edits, GPS info, network paths, MAC 
addresses in odd cases. It all depends on the file format.

Metadata in a Word DOC he sent to police had the name of 
his church, and last modified by “Dennis” in it.

Is that an unintended thumbnail in your EXIF data, or are 
you just happy to see me? 
Darkanaku/Nephew chan 
A user on 4chan posts a pic of his semi-nude aunt 
taken with an iPhone, Anonymous pulls the EXIF 
GPS info from the file and hilarity ensues.

Sock puppetry

 Ever heard of Sybil attacks? 
 Think sock puppet, one entity acting as many 
 May allow for control of routing, elections, etc. 
 Makes many of the other attacks easier

No absolute fixes 
 Make it cost more to have nodes (hashcash) 
 IP restrictions:  
Both Tor and I2P restrict peering between IPs on 
the same /16  
 Central infrastructure may be more resilient against 
Sybil attacks (but has other issues)

Tagging attacks 
Timing attacks 
Irongeek.com 
 There’s much focus on this in academia, but I 
imagine application layer flaws are more likely to 
snag someone 
 So many subtle variation on profiling traffic 
 Could be: 
 Timing of data exchanges 
 Amount of traffic 
 Tagging of traffic by colluding peers 
 Generally takes a powerful adversary 
 Hard to defeat in “low latency” networks

I could just 
watch the 
timings. 
Pulse the 
data flows 
myself. 
Or even just 
change the load 
on the path. 
DoS outside 
host to affect 
traffic.  
Irongeek.com 
More routers 
More cover traffic  
(smaller needle in a larger haystack) 
Entry Guards for first hop 
One way tunnels 
Short lived tunnels may help, ends of tunnels act as rendezvous points 
Better peer profiling 
Signing of the data 
Fixed speeds 
Padding and Chaff 
Non-trivial delays and Batching

 Could be as simple as knowing who is up when a 
hidden service can be accessed 
 Techniques can be used to reduce the search set 
 Application flaws and information leaks can narrow

1. What server 
software are you 
running an eepSite on? 
2. Harvest as many 
peer IPs as I can. 
3. Is there a web 
service on the public 
facing IP using the 
same daemon? 
4. Does it respond to the 
same Vhost request? 
5. If so, yippy! Found 
you!

 Give less data that could be used to reduce the
