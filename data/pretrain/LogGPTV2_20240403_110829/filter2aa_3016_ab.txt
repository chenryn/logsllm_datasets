### Security Vulnerabilities in Cryptographic Chips

#### Mifare Classic and NXP
- **Security Breach**: The Mifare Classic, a widely used chip in access control systems, including hospitals and government buildings, was compromised by a group from Radboud University Nijmegen in the Netherlands.
- **Severity of the Issue**: The security of Mifare Classic was described as "kindergarten cryptography," highlighting its significant vulnerabilities.
- **NXP's Response**: NXP, the manufacturer, called the disclosure of the attack "irresponsible" and warned that it would cause "immense damages." However, a Dutch court ruled that the damage to NXP was due to the production and sale of a chip with known shortcomings, not the publication of the article.
- **Legal Outcome**: NXP lost the court battle, and the researchers were allowed to publish their findings.

#### Citizen Certificate and Renesas
- **Chip Details**: The Renesas HD65145C1 is a high-security 16-bit smart card microcontroller used in various high-security applications, including banking.
- **Certifications**: The chip received certifications for conforming to Protection Profile BSI-PP-0002-2001 at Common Criteria assurance level EAL4+ and FIPS 130-2 Validation Certificate at Level 2 from NIST, USA.
- **Vulnerability**: In 2013, 103 Citizen Certificates using the Renesas HD65145C1 chip were broken by computing the GCD of RSA public moduli. This attack, known as "Coppersmith in the Wild," exploited common factors in RSA moduli to factorize them.

#### Infineon's ROCA Vulnerability
- **Discovery**: The vulnerability, known as "Return of Coppersmithâ€™s Attack (ROCA)," was discovered by researchers from the Centre for Research on Cryptography and Security at Masaryk University, Czech Republic; Enigma Bridge Ltd, Cambridge, UK; and Ca' Foscari University of Venice, Italy.
- **Prime Generation**: Infineon's prime generation method for RSA-1024 keys involved a fixed product of the first 71 primes, a 37-bit random integer, and a 135-bit random integer. This method, while faster, had a critical flaw.
- **Exploitation**: The researchers developed a black-box attack that did not require access to the library's source code or object code. They used RSA keys generated and exported from Infineon's cards and tokens to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Factoring Time**: Factoring an RSA-1024 modulus produced by Infineon chips took approximately 97.1 CPU days, which could be reduced to less than a day with 100 cores. Factoring an RSA-2048 modulus took 140.8 CPU years.
- **Impact**: Tens of millions of devices worldwide were affected by this vulnerability.

#### Morals and Lessons
- **Efficiency vs. Security**: Taking shortcuts to enhance efficiency can compromise security, making such practices very dangerous.
- **Secret Crypto Design**: Keeping cryptographic designs secret delays the discovery of flaws, increasing the potential impact when vulnerabilities are eventually found.
