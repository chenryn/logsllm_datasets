Machine Learning.
A PROOF OF THEOREM 1
Theorem 1. No definition of proxy use can satisfy Properties 1-4
simultaneously.
Proof. Proof by contradiction. Assume that a definition of proxy
use satisfies all four properties. Let X, Y, and Z be uniform binary
random variables, such that Pr(Y = X ⊕ Z) = 1, but X, Y and Z
are pairwise independent. By (explicit use of proxy), the model
𝒜(Y , Z) = Y ⊕ Z has proxy use of Z. By (dummy), the model
𝒜′(Y , Z , X) = Y ⊕ Z has proxy use of Z. Choose f (x, z) = x ⊕ z. By
our assumption earlier, Pr(Y = f (X , Z)) = 1. Therefore, by (prepro-
cessing), the model 𝒜′′(Z , X) = 𝒜′(f (X , Z), Z , X) has proxy use of
Z. Note that 𝒜′′(Z , X) = X ⊕ Z ⊕ Z = X. Therefore, by (dummy),
𝒜′′′(X) = X has proxy use of Z. But, by (independence), 𝒜′′′ does
not have proxy use of Z. Therefore, we have a contradiction.
□
The key intuition behind this result is that Property 2 requires
proxy use to be preserved when an input is replaced with a function
that predicts that input via composition. However, with a purely
semantic view of function composition, the causal effect of the
proxy can disappear. The particular example of this observation we
use in the proof is Y ⊕ Z, where Z is the protected information type.
This function has proxy use of Z. However, if X ⊕ Z is a perfect
predictor for Y, then the example can be reduced to X ⊕ Z ⊕ Z = X,
which has no proxy use of Z. To overcome this impossibility result,
we choose a more syntactic notion of function composition, which
is tied to how the function is represented as a program, and looks
for evidence of proxy use within the representation.
B ALGORITHM FOR DETECTION
In this section we provide technical details about the detection
algorithm skipped from the main body of the paper. In particular, we
formally define the decomposition used in the implementation, how
machine learning models are translated to the term language, and
how associational tests mitigate spurious results due to sampling.
B.1 Decomposition
Before we present the formal algorithm for detection, we need to
develop notation for precisely denoting decompositions. Decompo-
sition follows naturally from the subterm relation on expressions.
However, as identical subterms can occur multiple times in an ex-
pression, care must be taken during substitution to distinguish
between occurrences. For this reason we define substitution po-
sitionally, where the subterm of expression e = op(e1, . . . , en) at
