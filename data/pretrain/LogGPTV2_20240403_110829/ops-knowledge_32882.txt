User: when i start uwsgi 2.0.11.2 under pyenv 2.7.11 i get:
ImportError: /home/user/.pyenv/versions/2.7.11/envs/master2/lib/python2.7/lib-dynload/_io.so: undefined symbol: _PyCodecInfo_GetIncrementalEncoder
also uwsgi prints
Python version: 2.7.10 (default, May 30 2015, 13:57:08)  [GCC 4.8.2]
not sure how to fix it
Assistant: I had the same (or better: a similar) problem with uwsgi when upgrading Python from 2.7.3 to 2.7.10:

The module that I tried to import was socket (socket.py)


Which in turn tried to import _socket (_socket.so) - and the unresolved symbol was _PyInt_AsInt


The problem is a mismatch between some functions between Python minor minor releases (which doesn't break any backward compatibility, BTW). Let me detail:

Build time: when your uwsgi was built, the build was against Python 2.7.10
(as you specified). Python could have been compiled/built:

statically - most likely, the PYTHON LIBRARY (from now on, I am going to refer to it as PYTHONCORE as it's named by its creators) in this case: (libpython2.7.a) is in a static lib which is included in the python executable resulting a huge ~6MB executable
dynamically - PYTHONCORE (libpython2.7.so) is a dynamic library which python executable (~10KB of bytes large, this time) uses at runtime

Run time: the above uwsgi must run in an Python 2.7.11 environment

Regardless of how Python is compiled, the following thing happened: between 2.7.10 and 2.7.11 some internal functions were added/removed (in our case added) from both:

PYTHONCORE
Dynamic (or extension) modules (written in C) - .so files located in ${PYTHON_LIB_DIR}/lib-dynload (e.g. /home/user/.pyenv/versions/2.7.11/envs/master2/lib/python2.7/lib-dynload); any dynamic module (.so) is a client for PYTHONCORE

So, basically it's a version mismatch (encountered at runtime):

2.7.10 (which uwsgi was compiled against):

PYTHONCORE - doesn't export PyCodecInfo_GetIncrementalEncoder
_io.so (obviously) doesn't use the exported func (so, no complains at import time)

2.7.11 (which uwsgi is run against):

PYTHONCORE - still (as it was "embedded" in uwsgi at compile (build) time, so it's still 2.7.10) doesn't export PyCodecInfo_GetIncrementalEncoder
_io.so - uses/needs it


resulting a situation where a Python 2.7.11 dynamic module was used against Python 2.7.10 runtime, which is unsupported.
As a conclusion make sure that your uwsgi buildmachine is in sync (from Python PoV) with the runmachine, or - in other words - build uwsgi with the same Python version you intend to run it with!
