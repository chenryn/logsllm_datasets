User: How to write an HTTP proxy server using Python to filter and modify user requests and responses?
Assistant: To write an HTTP proxy server to filter and modify user requests and responses, you can use the Socket and HTTP libraries in Python. The following are some basic steps: 1. Establish a Socket connection: Use the Socket library in Python to establish a TCP connection to listen to client requests. 2. Receive the request from the client: When the client sends a request, receive it through the Socket. 3. Parsing the request: Use the HTTP library to parse the request in order to operate the request. 4. Filter and modify requests: Modify the request body or headers to meet your requirements. 5. Forward the request: Send the modified request to the target server. 6. Receive the response from the target server: Receive the response from the target server through Socket. 7. Parse the response: use the HTTP library to parse the response in order to manipulate this response. 8. Filter and modify responses: Modify the response body or headers to suit your requirements. 9. Send response to client: Send the modified response back to the client. 10. Close connection: close the Socket connection. Here is a code example: ``` import socket import http.client import urllib.parse HOST = '' # any available interface PORT = 8000 # port of the proxy server def handle_request(client_socket): # receive requests from clients request = client_socket .recv(1024) # Parse the request request_str = request.decode('utf-8') request_lines = request_str.split('\r\n') # Get the method, URL and protocol version of the request method, url, version = request_lines [0].split() # Parse URL url_parts = urllib.parse.urlparse(url) hostname = url_parts.hostname path = url_parts.path or '/' query = url_parts.query # Connect to target server conn = http.client.HTTPConnection (hostname) conn.request(method, path + '?' + query, headers={'Host': hostname}) res = conn.getresponse() # Receive response from target server response = res.read() # filter And modify the response response_str = response.decode('utf-8') response_str = response_str.replace('old', 'new') response = response_str.encode('utf-8') # Send the response to the client client_socket.sendall (response) # Close the connection conn.close() client_socket.close() if __name__ == '__main__': # Establish a Socket connection server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) server_socket.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1) server_socket.bind((HOST, PORT)) server_socket.listen(1) while True: # Receive requests from clients client_socket, client_addr = server_socket.accept() handle_request(client_socket) ```
