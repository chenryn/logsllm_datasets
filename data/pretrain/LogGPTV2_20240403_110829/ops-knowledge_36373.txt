Assistant: Facing the same issue, the solution was hastened by reviewing scrapyd's error log. The logs are possibly located in the folder /tmp/scrapydeploy-{six random letters}/. Check out stderr. Mine contained a permissions error: IOError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/binary_agilo-1.3.15-py2.7.egg/EGG-INFO/entry_points.txt'. This happens to be a packaged that was installed system-wide last week, thus leading to scrapyd-deploy failing to execute. Removing the package fixes the issue. (Instead, the binary_agilo package is installed in a virtualenv.)
