promise their location. In contrast, TARF does not suffer from
these problems as it enables submerged nodes to directly com-
municate through the water-air interface.
Finally, recent research has explored other means of under-
water communication, including optics [31, 55] and quantum
entanglement [26]. In contrast to TARF, the former has the
same drawbacks of RF waves in its limited range [31, 55] and
the latter is theoretical or still in the proof-of-concept phase.
Wireless Sensing. Over the past few years, the networking
community has taken much interest in using communication
signals for sensing purposes, e.g., sensing human locations,
gestures, and vital signs [6, 7, 39]. Similarly, the radar com-
munity has explored wireless for sensing coarse water surface
levels and surface currents [16]. TARF is inspired by these
recent advances but differs in its goals, technique, and ca-
pabilities. Specifically, in contrast to past work on sensing,

• Deep-sea Exploration: Deployed underwater sensors could
perform continuous monitoring and leverage TARF to send
their collected information to the outside world. A drone
may fly over large areas and collect information from a
network of deployed underwater nodes.
• Submarine Communication: Submarines could leverage
TARF to communicate with airplanes without the need for
surfacing or compromising their locations.
• Search and Recovery: Finally, uplink communication can
contribute to solving the long-standing problem of find-
ing vehicles that go missing underwater (e.g., missing air-
planes). In particular, TARF would enable these vehicles to
continuously send distress signals to the surface, which can
be picked up from the air, enabling rapid airborne search
for lost or malfunctioning vehicles.
In what follows, we first explore the unique properties of
TARF’s wireless channel in §4, then describe our design of
TARF transmitter and receiver in §5 and §6 respectively.
4 UNDERSTANDING THE TARF
COMMUNICATION CHANNEL
We start by analyzing TARF’s communication channel. The
channel consists of three components: underwater propaga-
tion, the water-air interface, and in-air propagation. Since the
underwater and in-air propagation components follow stan-
dard communication channels [33, 50], we focus our discus-
sion on the water-air interface then incorporate our analysis
into the end-to-end channel.
4.1 The Water-Air Interface
Recall that a TARF underwater transmitter sends packets
using acoustic signals. These signals travel in the medium as
pressure waves P(r , t), which vary in time t and range r, and
can be expressed as [33]:
P(ω, t) = A(ω)e jω(t−r/vw)
(1)
where A is the amplitude, ω is the angular frequency, and vw
is the velocity in water. Note that the amplitude A is also a
function of distance r, but we omit it for simplicity.
Below, we first quantify the amount of surface displacement
caused by these pressure waves, then describe how TARF can
measure these displacements.
4.1.1 How much surface displacement do acoustic
pressure waves create?
Acoustic pressure waves are longitudinal waves. As they prop-
agate in a medium, they displace the medium’s particles along
their same direction of travel. (Such particle displacement is
similar to how particles of a spring move as it compresses and
relaxes due to a pressure wave traveling through it.) Hence,
when a pressure wave hits the surface of water, it also causes
a surface displacement δ. This displacement can be computed

Figure 2—Surface Vibrations Translate into Phase Modulation. The
phase of the wireless reflection changes with minute surface vibrations.
TARF introduces a new technique that leverages sensing for
communication, particularly to enable communication across
the water-air boundary. In terms of capabilities, due to its
wavelength of operation, TARF can extract displacements
of the order of few microns, i.e., at a scale three orders of
magnitude finer than the millimeter-scale movements of past
work [7, 10]. And finally, TARF builds on its basic idea of
acoustic-RF translational communication to develop a full
system that can address practical constraints including ocean
waves and coupled RF-acoustic channels.
3 TARF OVERVIEW
TARF is a new communication technology that allows sub-
merged underwater nodes to wirelessly communicate directly
with nodes over the water’s surface. The communication link
naturally consists of three components shown in Fig. 2:
• Transmitter: A TARF underwater node sends packets using
a standard acoustic transducer (e.g., underwater speaker).
The transmitter leverages signals in the 100-200 Hz fre-
quency range, which are typically used for underwater
communications by submarines and AUVs due to their low
attenuation and long travel distances in water [44, 44, 45].
• Channel: The acoustic signal travels as a pressure wave
inside the water. When the pressure wave hits the water
surface, it causes a surface displacement that is proportional
to the pressure wave.
• Receiver: TARF’s receiver consists of a millimeter-wave
FMCW (Frequency Modulated Carrier Wave) radar. The
radar transmits a wideband signal (centered around
60 GHz) and measures its reflection off the water’s surface.
As the water surface vibrates due to the acoustic pressure
waves, these vibrations modulate the phase of the reflected
signal. The radar receiver extracts these phase changes and
decodes them in order to recover the transmitted packets.
Scope. TARF focuses on the problem of uplink wireless com-
munication between underwater and airborne nodes. Enabling
such communication opens up capabilities in several areas:

by solving the boundary conditions of the wave equation. In
the interest of brevity, we include the solution below and refer
the interested reader to [51] for a derivation. Assuming the
incident wave is orthogonal to the surface, we can derive:
(2)
where P is the overall pressure created by the acoustic wave
and ρw is the density of water.
ρwωvw
To better understand this relationship, we perform experi-
ments with an underwater speaker. We use the Electro-Voice
Underwater Speaker [1], place it about half a meter below the
surface of water, and point it upward toward the surface in a
setup similar to that shown in Fig. 2. The speaker transmits
an acoustic signal, and we measure the displacement at the
surface of the water.1
We perform three types of experiments. First, we transmit a
single tone from the speaker, first at a lower and then a higher
frequency, and plot the measured displacement in Fig. 3(a).
Next, we transmit two tones simultaneously from the speaker
and plot the fourier transform of the resulting displacement in
Fig. 3(b). And finally, we run an experiment where we vary
the frequency of the transmitted tone over time and plot the
peak-to-peak displacement in Fig. 3(c).
Based on these figures, we observe the following:
• The displacement caused by the pressure wave is very
minute: Fig. 3(a) shows that the peak-to-peak displacement
is of the order of a few µm to a few tens of µm, even though
the underwater transmitter was only submerged half a meter
below the water’s surface.
• The water-air interface acts as a linear channel in the con-
text of TARF communication: In particular, the frequency
of the surface displacement matches the frequency of the
transmitted acoustic signals by the underwater speaker in
Fig. 3(a)-(b). Such behavior is in line with Eq. 2, which
shows that the displacement is directly proportional to the
pressure wave. This means that the water-air interface acts
as a linear (and time-invariant) channel. Such channels
1Note that for measuring the displacement, we use the millimeter-wave radar
we built as described in §7.

are amenable to different modulation schemes (AM, FM,
BPSK, OFDM, etc.) and can be estimated with preamble
symbols and inverted for reconstruction and decoding.
• The amplitude of the displacement is inversely proportional
to the frequency of the transmitted acoustic signal: This can
be seen through the 1/ω decay in Fig. 3(c), which matches
the expected behavior in Eq. 2. This property implies that
lower frequencies are more desirable for TARF communi-
cation as they will cause a larger displacement, and hence
a larger signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). It also implies that
signals at different frequencies experience very different
attenuation and that an optimal communication protocol
should account for this unique feature of the channel.
4.1.2 Why can’t we rely on acoustic signals alone?
Since the acoustic wave hits the surface and causes a displace-
ment, the displacement itself can generate a pressure wave
that travels in air. Hence, we ask whether it would be more
efficient to directly leverage the generated pressure wave in
the air for communication.
There are multiple reasons why such an approach is unde-
sirable. First, while part of the pressure wave indeed crosses
the boundary and travels in air, the majority of the incident
pressure wave reflects off the water-air interface. In particular,
by solving the sound wave equation for a wave incident at a
boundary between two different media, we obtain the follow-
ing relationship between the amplitude of the reflected wave
Ar and the amplitude of the incident one Ai [33]:
where va and vw are the speeds of sound in air and water
respectively and ρa and ρw are the air and water densities.
Due to the large difference between the constants for air and
water, the reflected amplitude is almost equal to the incident
one (i.e., Ar ≃ Ai). And, by the law of conservation of energy,
the amplitude of the transmitted signal At =
r . Using
standard values for velocity and density [60], we can show
that pressure waves crossing into air attenuate by around 30dB
solely because of reflection at the boundary.

Second, aside from the attenuation at the boundary, acous-
tic waves experience exponential attenuation when traveling
in air [33]. This makes them an unsuitable means for wireless
communication over the air. Indeed, this is why wireless com-
munication systems like WiFi and cellular employ RF signals
instead of ultrasonic/acoustic signals.
4.1.3 Why can’t we leverage the water-air interface for
downlink communication?
So far, our discussion has focused on uplink communication.
A natural question is: why can’t we use the same technique to
enable an in-air node to communicate with an underwater hy-
drophone. In principle, an acoustic signal transmitted from an
airborne speaker should also cause a vibration of the water-air
interface that can be picked up by an underwater hydrophone.
The answer lies in the nature of interference between the
incident and reflected pressure waves at the water-air bound-
ary. Specifically, these waves constructively interfere when
they hit the boundary of a less dense medium (i.e., when
traveling from water to air), but destructively interfere when
they hit the boundary of a more dense medium (i.e., when
traveling from air to water). Since the displacement is directly
proportional to the overall pressure as per Eq. 2, the displace-
ment is maximized for underwater pressure waves, but it is
nulled for acoustic signals arriving from the air. Hence, while
this mechanism enables underwater-to-air communication, it
cannot enable an air-to-underwater communication link.
4.2 End-to-end TARF Channel
Now that we understand the water-air interface, we would
like to quantify the impact of each of the channel components
on the overall signal attenuation:
• Underwater Propagation. The attenuation of acoustic sig-
nals traveling underwater can be described by e−γ r/r where
r is the depth and γ quantifies the absorption. This equation
shows that the amplitude of the acoustic pressure wave
decays exponentially as it travels underwater.
• Water-Air Interface. The attenuation at the water-air inter-
face is given by Eq. 2 in terms of pressure. Assuming that
the received power is proportional to δ(ω, t)2, and knowing
that the transmitted power is proportional to P(ω, t)2 and
inversely proportional to ρw and vw [11], we can express
the sensed power at the water-air interface as:
Psensed ∝ Pincident
ρwvwω2
(4)
• In-Air Propagation. A standard radar signals attenuates
as 1/d2
0, where d0 is the distance between the transmitter
and the receiver [47].2 However, because water is specular
at the wavelengths of RF signals (i.e., it reflects back all
the impinging RF signals) [19], we can approximate the
overall signal attenuation as 1/(2d0).
2Power decays as 1/d4
0 , but the signal amplitude attenuates as 1/d2
0 .
Given the above breakdown, the overall pathloss (PL) in dB
is linear in depth r and logarithmic in height d0, density ρw ,
frequency ω, and velocity vw . Since ρw and vw are known,3
estimating the overall attenuation requires estimating only
r and d0. Further, since the path loss increases linearly in r
but logarithmically in d0, the dominant unknown path loss
component is expected to be r. In §5, we explain how TARF
can estimate this component.
5 DESIGNING A TARF TRANSMITTER
In this section, we describe how TARF’s acoustic transducer
encodes and modulates its transmissions by taking into ac-
count the properties of the TARF communication channel.
5.1 What is the right modulation scheme?
Recall that TARF’s channel is amenable to various modula-
tion schemes since it is linear and time-invariant. The chan-
nel, however, is highly frequency selective, as can be seen
in Fig. 3(c). Such frequency-selective fading leads to inter-
symbol interference, which complicates the receiver design.
To deal with such frequency-selective fading, TARF em-
ploys Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)
as an encoding scheme at its transmitter. OFDM is widely
used in WiFi and LTE systems. In what follows, we briefly
describe how OFDM works and refer the interested reader
to [60] for more information.
Instead of encoding the transmitted bits directly in the time
domain, an OFDM transmitter encodes symbols in the fre-
quency domain. For example, if we consider each frequency
