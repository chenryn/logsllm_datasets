**ATT&CK ID:** T1529  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** System Shutdown/Reboot

Adversaries may initiate system shutdowns or reboots to disrupt access to, or facilitate the destruction of, targeted systems. Most operating systems provide built-in commands for shutting down or rebooting a local machine or network device. In some cases, these commands can also be used to remotely initiate a shutdown or reboot of a computer or network device through the Network Device Command-Line Interface (CLI), such as using the `reload` command.

### Key Points:
- **Purpose:** To interrupt access or aid in the destruction of systems.
- **Methods:**
  - Local shutdown/reboot commands on the target system.
  - Remote shutdown/reboot commands via Network Device CLI (e.g., `reload`).

This technique can be particularly effective in scenarios where adversaries aim to cover their tracks, cause disruption, or prevent forensic analysis.
