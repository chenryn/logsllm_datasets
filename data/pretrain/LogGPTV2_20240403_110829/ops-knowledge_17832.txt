User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题SQL Server 2005 dropping objects from DB on recovery? SQL Server 2005 dropped a user from one of our mirrored databases after we recovered from a simple Windows-update induced restart of the machine. 

I checked and the login is not in the mirror server (it is in the primary). If the system experienced a failover, would that explain why the user was removed from the user DB upon recovery back to the primary? I can't find anything in the doc that would indicate that SQL server would DROP orphaned users (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms175475%28SQL.90%29.aspx). Is there anything I should look for in the logs?

Edit: 
Setup before failure:
PRIMARY - Login OK. User in database OK.
MIRROR - Login does not exist. User does not exist in database.

After failure:
PRIMARY - Login OK. User does not exist in database.
MIRROR - Login does not exist. User does not exist in database.

EDIT: After the recovery of a DB system after WINDOWS UPDATES reboot last week, we noticed a trigger was missing from one of our tables, as was another user. I am 100% confident this is NOT our doing (we only have two sa's and I am one of them). WHAT THE HECK IS GOING ON? This has to be a bug with SQL Server 2005 mirroring.

Assistant: Did the mirror server ever have the login created?  If not you'll need to script out the login from the primary system so that the SIDs match.
