On the beta version, the container that previously displayed the message "output will go here" no longer shows the challenge output. Instead, it only displays notifications indicating whether the tests are running or have completed.

Here are the screenshots for reference:

Is this change intentional, or is it a bug? If we are intentionally removing the challenge output, we should update the default message to reflect this. However, I believe it is beneficial to continue showing the output, as it provides valuable and tangible feedback to the user.

@freeCodeCamp/moderators, does anyone have any information on this? I may have missed a previous discussion or issue related to this change.
