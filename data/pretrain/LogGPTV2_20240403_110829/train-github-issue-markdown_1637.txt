On beta, this container (which still has a message which says "output will go
here"), no longer shows the challenges' output:

Instead, we only see the notification that the tests are running or have
completed:

Are we doing away with showing the challenge output or is this unintentional?
If we are, we need to change that default message. But I think we should still
show it, it's nice to have that tangible feedback.

missed a previous issue.
