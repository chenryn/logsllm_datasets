This log chunk, consisting of 20 lines, provides a detailed record of the activities within a distributed file system, specifically focusing on the DataNode and FSNamesystem components. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step summary of the key events:

1. **Block Reception by DataNodes:**
   - Multiple DataNodes (e.g., process IDs 832, 1001, 952, 1110, 1138, 1283, 1334, 1333) received blocks of size 67,108,864 bytes from various IP addresses. For example:
     - Block `blk_-5704899712662113150` was received from `10.251.91.229`.
     - Block `blk_-5861636720645142679` was received from `10.251.70.211`.
     - Block `blk_8291449241650212794` was received from `10.251.89.155`.

2. **Block Addition to BlockMap by FSNamesystem:**
   - The FSNamesystem component (e.g., process IDs 28, 29, 31, 33, 27) updated the blockMap to include new blocks and their locations. For instance:
     - Block `blk_-4794867979917102672` was added to `10.251.74.79:50010`.
     - Block `blk_8763662564934652249` was added to `10.251.38.197:50010`.
     - Block `blk_7453815855294711849` was added to `10.251.74.134:50010`.

3. **Block Allocation for User Tasks:**
   - The FSNamesystem allocated a block (`blk_-5319073033164653435`) for a user task at the path `/user/root/rand/_temporary/_task_200811092030_0001_m_000487_0/part-00487`.

4. **Block Verification:**
   - A DataBlockScanner (process ID 13) verified the integrity of block `blk_-4980916519894289629`, confirming its successful verification.

5. **Block Reception in Progress:**
   - Several DataNodes (e.g., process IDs 997, 1084, 1278, 1357) were in the process of receiving blocks from source to destination IP addresses. For example:
     - Block `blk_-28342503914935090` was being received from `10.251.123.132:57542` to `10.251.123.132:50010`.
     - Block `blk_-5009020203888190378` was being received from `10.251.199.19:52622` to `10.251.199.19:50010`.

In summary, this log chunk documents the reception, storage, and management of data blocks within a distributed file system, highlighting the roles of DataNodes in receiving blocks and the FSNamesystem in updating the blockMap and allocating blocks for user tasks.
