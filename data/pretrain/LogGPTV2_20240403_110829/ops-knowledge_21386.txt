It sounds like you're experiencing an issue with logging the output of your web2py Python script. Here's a more detailed and professional response to address your concern:

**Issue:**
You are running a web2py Python script and attempting to log its output to a file, but the logging is not working as expected. The command you are using is:

```sh
nohup python /var/www/web2py/web2py.py -S cloud -M -N -R applications/cloud/private/process.py >>/var/log/web2pyserver.log 2>&1 &
```

You have also tried running the script without `nohup`, but the logging still does not work. Additionally, the default `nohup` logging to `nohup.out` is not functioning.

**Resolution:**
After further investigation, it appears that the Python process, when run with `nohup`, was indeed logging the output, but in batch mode. This means that the output was being written to the log file, but only after a significant amount of time, rather than instantaneously.

**Explanation:**
- **Batch Mode Logging:** In some cases, especially with long-running processes or those that buffer their output, the logging might not be immediate. The output is buffered and written to the log file in batches.
- **Buffering:** Python by default buffers the standard output (stdout) and standard error (stderr). This can cause delays in seeing the output in the log file.

**Suggestions:**
1. **Disable Buffering:**
   You can disable buffering in Python by setting the environment variable `PYTHONUNBUFFERED` to `1`. This will ensure that the output is written to the log file immediately.

   ```sh
   nohup PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 python /var/www/webweb2py/web2py.py -S cloud -M -N -R applications/cloud/private/process.py >>/var/log/web2pyserver.log 2>&1 &
   ```

2. **Check File Permissions:**
   Ensure that the user running the script has the necessary permissions to write to the log file. You can check and modify the permissions using the `chmod` and `chown` commands.

   ```sh
   sudo chown your_username:your_group /var/log/web2pyserver.log
   sudo chmod 644 /var/log/web2pyserver.log
   ```

3. **Verify Log File Path:**
   Double-check the path `/var/log/web2pyserver.log` to ensure it is correct and that the directory exists. If the directory does not exist, create it.

   ```sh
   sudo mkdir -p /var/log
   sudo touch /var/log/web2pyserver.log
   ```

4. **Check for Errors:**
   If the issue persists, check for any errors or warnings in the system logs, such as `syslog` or `dmesg`, which might provide additional insights into why the logging is not working as expected.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the logging issue and see the output in the log file more promptly.
