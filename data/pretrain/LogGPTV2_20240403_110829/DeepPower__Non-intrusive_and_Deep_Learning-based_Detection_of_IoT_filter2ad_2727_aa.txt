## Abstract
The vulnerability of Internet of Things (IoT) devices to malware attacks poses significant challenges to current Internet security. IoT malware attacks typically involve three stages: intrusion, infection, and monetization. Existing approaches for detecting IoT malware often fail to identify malicious activities during the intrusion and infection stages, thus missing the opportunity to prevent potential attacks. In this paper, we introduce DeepPower, a non-intrusive approach that leverages deep learning to infer malicious activities of IoT malware by analyzing power side-channel signals. DeepPower first filters raw power signals to isolate suspicious ones, then performs a fine-grained analysis to infer the corresponding executed activities within the device. It determines the presence of ongoing malware infections through a correlation analysis of these activities. We implemented a prototype of DeepPower using low-cost sensors and evaluated its effectiveness against real-world IoT malware on commodity devices. Our experimental results show that DeepPower can detect infection activities of various IoT malware with high accuracy without requiring any modifications to the monitored devices.

## 1. Introduction
As the Internet of Things (IoT) becomes an integral part of our lives, it introduces both convenience and new security threats. Recent high-profile attacks on IoT devices have highlighted their vulnerabilities [3, 4, 47]. Compromised IoT devices can be used to launch Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks [3] or Permanent Denial of Service (PDoS) attacks [47]. Research divides IoT malware attacks into three stages: intrusion, infection, and monetization [44, 46]. Common activities in many IoT malware attacks include usage exploitation, malware downloading, permission changes, and binary execution. Early detection of these activities is crucial to minimize the damage caused by IoT malware.

Malware detection approaches can be broadly categorized into network-based and host-based methods. Network traffic analysis [19, 42] is commonly used to protect IoT systems, but it cannot examine the detailed activities executed within the devices. Host-based security mechanisms [2, 51] can provide more granular detection, but they are challenging to implement on resource-constrained IoT devices. A feasible solution should effectively monitor infection activities while requiring minimal changes to the software or hardware of IoT devices. Non-intrusive power side-channel analysis is a promising approach for this purpose.

Recent studies have developed non-intrusive power side-channel methods to distinguish between malicious and legitimate activities based on power consumption measurements [9, 33, 60]. However, existing methods often rely on normal and abnormal patterns, which can lead to false positives and do not differentiate between specific malicious activities and attack stages. Therefore, a fine-grained approach is necessary to identify executed activities and achieve effective detection of IoT malware.

In this paper, we address these challenges and present DeepPower, a novel framework for non-intrusive detection of IoT malware based on fine-grained power signal analysis. We perform a systematic analysis of IoT malware to identify common activity patterns, develop effective data preprocessing methods to handle noisy power signals, and use deep learning techniques to infer executed activities. Finally, DeepPower performs a correlation analysis to determine the presence of malware infections.

Our contributions include:
- A study of IoT malware infection processes based on open-source malware and reverse engineering reports, categorizing malicious activities into one intrusion and five infection states.
- Development of effective data preprocessing methods, including wavelet denoising and feature extraction, to improve the performance of malware detection.
- Proposal of DeepPower, a framework for non-intrusive detection of IoT malware using power signals and deep learning, which includes fast signal detection and an attention-based Seq2Seq model for fine-grained analysis.
- Implementation and evaluation of DeepPower using low-cost sensors and commodity IoT devices, demonstrating high accuracy in detecting infection activities without modifying the devices.

## 2. Threat Model and Deployment Scenarios
### 2.1 Threat Model
We focus on Linux-based IoT devices, which are the primary targets of IoT malware [3, 10]. Remote attackers may exploit various vulnerabilities, such as firmware flaws, unprotected authentication, and vulnerable applications, to compromise these devices. The intrusion process involves gaining remote access, while the infection process includes preparing the environment and executing malware. We aim to detect IoT malware that performs malicious or destructive behaviors by injecting commands. Although most IoT malware targets BusyBox-based Linux devices, our design is applicable to any Linux-based devices.

### 2.2 Deployment Scenarios
Our goal is to design a low-cost, non-intrusive IoT malware detection solution that can support various deployment scenarios. This solution has the advantage of being deployable for critical IoT devices, such as IP cameras, without the need for extensive modifications. There are several feasible deployment solutions:

- **Independent Monitoring System**: Our detection solution can be implemented as an independent system placed between the IoT device and the AC power adapter.
- **Smart Plug Integration**: The solution can be integrated into existing Smart Plug products that monitor energy consumption.
- **Internal Power Sensors**: IoT device vendors can integrate power sensors into their devices, making it easier to monitor power consumption.

## 3. Identifying Intrusion and Infection Activities of IoT Malware
We collected and analyzed open-source IoT malware, including Mirai [41], Linux.wifatch [58], and Lightaidra [16], along with reverse engineering reports [3, 23]. We identified two typical stages in IoT malware attacks: the intrusion process, where attackers gain access to the device, and the infection process, where the environment is prepared, and malware is downloaded and executed.

### 3.1 Intrusion Process of IoT Malware
The intrusion process involves attackers attempting to log into IoT devices. Common vulnerabilities include weak/default passwords and unpatched or zero-day vulnerabilities. Table 1 summarizes the intrusion types and associated security issues.

| Intrusion Type | Attack Type | Security Issue |
|----------------|-------------|----------------|
| Vulnerable Authentication | DDoS, PDoS, Brute Force | Weak/default passwords, lack of encryption, backdoors |
| Unpatched Vulnerabilities | DDoS, Crypto-currency mining, Buffer Overflow, Backdoor | Exploiting unpatched or new vulnerabilities |

### 3.2 Infection Process of IoT Malware
After gaining access, the attacker executes commands to prepare the environment and download and execute malware. Common commands include `echo`, `cat`, and `rm` for file manipulation and `kill` or `killall` to terminate services. For example, Mirai executes commands to check and customize the environment, find a writable folder, and download malware files.

## 4. DeepPower Design
DeepPower consists of several key components:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Filters raw power signals to isolate suspicious ones and applies wavelet denoising and feature extraction to handle noise.
- **Activity Inference**: Uses deep learning, specifically an attention-based Seq2Seq model, to infer executed activities from power signals.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Determines the presence of malware infections by correlating inferred activities with known infection states.

## 5. Implementation and Evaluation
We implemented DeepPower using low-cost sensors and evaluated its effectiveness on real-world IoT malware. Our experiments showed that DeepPower can detect infection activities with high accuracy (90.4% on average) without modifying the monitored devices.

## 6. Related Work
Previous research has explored various methods for detecting IoT malware, including network-based and host-based approaches. Non-intrusive power side-channel analysis has shown promise, but existing methods often suffer from high false positive rates and lack fine-grained activity identification.

## 7. Conclusion
DeepPower is a novel, non-intrusive framework for detecting IoT malware using power side-channel signals and deep learning. By addressing the challenges of noisy power signals and fine-grained activity inference, DeepPower provides an effective solution for early detection of IoT malware, thereby enhancing the security of IoT devices.
