recovery  service  without  injecting  an  error,  and  observe  whether  POD-Recovery  takes  any 
action.  For  each  recovery  point  (RP)  we  do  this  50  times.  Since  error  detection  triggers  the 
recovery  service,  and  since  POD-Recovery  does  not  consider  any  causes  offered  by  the 
triggering  message,  we  do  not  investigate  any  more  complex  false  positives.  Also,  as  argued 
above, if a transient error disappears before recovery starts, we consider it to be a false positive 
from the viewpoint of recovery. 
2)  Experimental Results 
Table 52 shows the recovery service’s ability to handle false positives from the error detection 
service. We can see that all the false positives were successfully detected: in all 400 runs of our 
experiment, no recovery action was taken.

3)  Satisfying Recovery Requirement R6 
Due  to  the  design  of  our  recovery  method,  with  its  dynamic  plan  generation,  false  positives 
from error detection will not cause unnecessary recovery actions.

G.  Recovery for Recovery Itself  
1)  Experimental Procedure 
To test POD-Recovery’s behaviour when errors occur during the execution of the recovery plan, 
I  performed  the  migration  operation,  injected  faults  into  each  determined  recovery  point  to 
trigger  POD-Recovery,  waited  for  the  selected  recovery  action  to  execute,  and  then  manually 
injected additional faults into the recovery action to trigger the “recovery of recovery” block. I 
performed  30  runs  of  this test  of  “recovery  for  recovery  itself”  for  each  recovery  point  of  the 
migration operation. 
2)  Experimental Results 
Table  53  shows  the  recovery  time  of  “recovery for  recovery”  on the  migration  operation. The 
relative standard deviation is at most 2.0%.
