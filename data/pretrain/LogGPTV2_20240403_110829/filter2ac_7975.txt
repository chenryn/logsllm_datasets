### Title: Black Hat EU-20: My Ticks Don't Lie: New Timing Attacks for Hypervisor Detection

**Abstract:**

Hypervisor detection is a critical component of sandbox evasion techniques. Although hardware-assisted virtualization solutions are essential for scalable dynamic malware analysis, they introduce timing discrepancies compared to bare-metal machines. These discrepancies can be exploited by sophisticated malware authors using low-level measurement sequences. Modern sandboxes often mitigate such attempts by manipulating the values that malware can read from traditional time sources.

In this talk, we will explore how the battle against hypervisor detection is far from over. By leveraging recent advancements in microarchitectural research, we will present and demonstrate two novel hypervisor detection methods that current anti-evasion techniques seem unable to counteract.

**First Method: High-Resolution Covert Time Source**

We propose constructing a high-resolution covert time source using a dedicated counter thread. This thread can tick as accurately as an unpatched Time Stamp Counter (TSC) and, in some cases, with even higher resolution. We will revisit well-known evasion techniques from both evasive malware and academic research, demonstrating their effectiveness when using this new time source.

**Second Method: Prime+Probe Attack on Last-Level Cache**

The second method involves a prime+probe attack on the last-level cache to detect pollution caused by the execution of the Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM) within the hypervisor. This approach exploits the microarchitectural characteristics of the system to reveal the presence of the hypervisor.

**Real-World Investigation:**

An investigation conducted on real-world sandboxes revealed that while many traditional time-based evasion techniques are no longer effective, the use of counter threads can revive them without triggering alerts related to time query attempts. Additionally, microarchitectural attacks do not appear to be on the radar of most sandboxes, making them a promising addition to the malware arsenal.

By combining these new techniques, we aim to highlight the ongoing challenges in hypervisor detection and the need for more advanced anti-evasion strategies.
