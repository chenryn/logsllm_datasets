User: How to configure and manage Nginx load balancing cluster on multiple servers?
Assistant: There are two ways to enable Nginx to achieve load balancing: IP-based and domain name-based. Regardless, all Nginx servers must be installed with the same configuration. 1. IP-based load balancing 1. Install and configure Nginx Install Nginx on all Nginx servers and make sure they all run the same version of Nginx. Then, follow the steps below to configure Nginx: Install the upstream server on all servers. To do this, find the upstream statement block in the Nginx configuration file to specify the IP address and port to be load balanced, for example: ``` upstream backend { server backend1.example .com:8080; server backend2.example.com:8080; } ``` Configure the location block of the Nginx site, for example: ``` location / { proxy_pass http://backend; } ``` The above configuration will forward the request to One of the list of servers specified by upstream. 2. Test start Nginx and verify load balancing. For testing, start Nginx on all servers and access Nginx's IP address and port. Each visit should return the HTML for the site on a different server. This simple test ensures that each server is able to act as a backend server. 3. Deployment To deploy load balancing in a production environment, please follow the steps below: Create a copy of the Nginx configuration file to ensure that the Nginx configuration on all servers is the same. Use standard system management tools (such as ansible) to batch deploy Nginx and start it. 2. Load balancing based on domain name 1. Install and configure Nginx Install Nginx on all Nginx servers, and configure Nginx according to the following steps: Configure the server statement block of the Nginx site. To do this, please open the Nginx configuration file and add the following statement: ` `` server { listen 80; server_name example.com; location / { proxy_pass http://backend; } } ``` Specify the domain name to load balance and forward all requests to other servers. Next, specify the upstream server. Please find the upstream statement block in the Nginx configuration file and specify the server to be used for load balancing, for example: ``` upstream backend { server backend1.example.com:8080; server backend2.example.com:8080; } `` ` 2. Test start Nginx and verify load balancing. To test, visit the Nginx site URL and check that the load balancer is able to forward requests to different servers in a round-robin fashion. 3. Deployment To deploy this configuration to a production environment, perform the following steps: Make sure that the same version of Nginx is installed on all Nginx servers, and all servers > can access the servers listed in upstream. Create a copy of the Nginx configuration file, and use a system management tool (such as ansible) to batch deploy Nginx and start it. Point the domain name to the Nginx server on the DNS server. The steps mentioned in this article are only used to briefly demonstrate how to deploy. If you need to deploy an IP-based or domain name-based load balancer to a production environment, please carefully consider server configuration, security, monitoring, and scalability.
