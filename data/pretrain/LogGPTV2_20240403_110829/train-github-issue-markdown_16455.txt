Hi,
im using Yaml Component in a project,  
but when I dump a array into a YAML,  
it returns something like this:  
Yaml::dump()
    test:
        value: "1 \r\n 2 \r\n 3"
and I need something like this:  
Yaml::dump()
    test:
        value: |
            1
            2
            3
This is the original array:
    Array(
        "teste" => Array(
            "value" => "1
    2
    3"
        )
    )
Its is possible?
