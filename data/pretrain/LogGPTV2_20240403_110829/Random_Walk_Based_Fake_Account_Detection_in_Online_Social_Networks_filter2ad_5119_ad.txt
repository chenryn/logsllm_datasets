# Sybil Detection Methods: Comparative Analysis and Evaluation

## Introduction
This document provides a comparative analysis of several Sybil detection methods, including SybilWalk, SybilWalk-Var, CIA, and SybilRank. The evaluation is based on the Twitter dataset, focusing on key metrics such as AUC (Area Under the Curve), FPR (False Positive Rate), and FNR (False Negative Rate). Additionally, we examine the robustness to label noise and the scalability of these methods.

## Results on the Twitter Dataset

### Figure 4: Fraction of Sybils in Top-K Ranked Nodes
- **Description**: This figure shows the fraction of Sybils in the top-K ranked nodes for each method, with K varying from 10,000 to 150,000.
- **Observations**:
  - SybilWalk accurately detects top-ranked Sybils, with 99% of the top-80,000 nodes being Sybils.
  - CIA and SybilRank perform poorly, with only 29.9% and 0.27% of the top-80,000 nodes being Sybils, respectively.

### Table II: AUCs, FPRs, and FNRs on the Twitter Dataset
- **SybilWalk**:
  - AUC: 0.96
  - FPR: 1.3%
  - FNR: 17.3%
- **SybilWalk-Var**:
  - AUC: 0.92
  - FPR: 4.8%
  - FNR: 31.1%
- **CIA**:
  - AUC: 0.82
  - FPR: N/A
  - FNR: N/A
- **SybilRank**:
  - AUC: 0.52
  - FPR: N/A
  - FNR: N/A

**Note**: CIA and SybilRank are not classification methods, so they do not have FPR and FNR results.

### Classification Methodology
- **SybilWalk and SybilWalk-Var**:
  - A node is classified as a Sybil if its badness score is greater than 0.5.
  - FPR: Fraction of benign nodes incorrectly classified as Sybils.
  - FNR: Fraction of Sybils incorrectly classified as benign nodes.

## Robustness to Label Noise

### Figure 5: AUCs of Compared Methods on the Facebook Dataset with Increasing Label Noises
- **Description**: This figure shows the AUCs of the compared methods on the Facebook dataset as the level of label noise increases.
- **Observations**:
  - SybilWalk and SybilWalk-Var are more robust to label noise than CIA and SybilRank.
  - SybilWalk can tolerate up to 20% label noise, while SybilWalk-Var can tolerate up to 10%.
  - When 50% of the labels are noisy, all methods achieve AUCs close to 0.5, indicating random performance.

## Scalability

### Figure 6: Running Times of Compared Methods on Synthesized Graphs with Varying Number of Edges
- **Description**: This figure shows the running times of the compared methods as the number of edges in the synthesized graphs increases.
- **Observations**:
  - All methods have linear time complexity.
  - SybilWalk is as scalable as previous random walk-based methods.

## Summary
- **SybilWalk**:
  - Tolerates weaker homophily and is more robust to label noises than existing random walk-based methods.
  - Maintains the same scalability as existing random walk-based methods.
- **Comparison with SybilWalk-Var**:
  - SybilWalk outperforms SybilWalk-Var in terms of robustness to label noise and detection accuracy.
  - Both methods have the same scalability.

## Conclusion and Future Work
- **Conclusion**:
  - SybilWalk overcomes the limitations of existing random walk-based methods while maintaining their advantages.
  - The key technique is to capture the structural gap between benign and Sybil nodes through a random walk on a label-augmented social network.
- **Future Work**:
  - Learning edge weights in the label-augmented social network.
  - Analyzing the bound of the number of falsely rejected benign nodes.
  - Generalizing the theoretical analysis to Markov Random Fields-based methods.
