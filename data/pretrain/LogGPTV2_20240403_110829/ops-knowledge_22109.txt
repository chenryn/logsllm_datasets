User: As I have started to use Python 3.4, I need pip to maintain libraries on both Python 2.7 and Python 3.4.
How to select the appropriate pip quickly using terminal?
Note:
This question is NOT related to Virtualenv but with the default python2.7 and python3.4 that comes with Fedora 22 Workstation. 
As a temporary fix, I am using PyCharm to manage libraries.
Assistant: Fedora separates Python 2.x and 3.x's environments. yum install python-pip will give you an executable called pip which you can use for Python 2.x packages, and yum install python3-pip will give you an executable called pip3for managing Python 3.x packages.
You can install either, both or neither - they will not interfere with each other.
