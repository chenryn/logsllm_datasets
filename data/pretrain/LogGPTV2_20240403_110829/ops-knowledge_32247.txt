HTTP status codes are three-digit numerical responses sent by a server to a client, indicating the outcome of a request. These codes are categorized into five classes, each representing a different type of response. Here is a detailed explanation:

1. **1xx (Informational):** The server has received the request and is still processing it. More information will be provided in subsequent responses.
   - Example: 101 Switching Protocols

2. **2xx (Success):** The request was successfully processed, and the server has returned the expected response.
   - **200 OK:** The request was successful, and the requested resource has been returned.
   - **201 Created:** The request was successful, and a new resource has been created as a result.
   - **204 No Content:** The request was successful, but there is no content to return.

3. **3xx (Redirection):** Further action is required to complete the request. This often involves redirecting the client to a different URL.
   - **301 Moved Permanently:** The requested resource has been permanently moved to a new location.
   - **302 Found:** The requested resource is temporarily located at a different URI.
   - **304 Not Modified:** The resource has not been modified since the last request, and the client can use the cached version.

4. **4xx (Client Error):** The request contains an error and cannot be fulfilled. The issue is on the client's side.
   - **400 Bad Request:** The request is malformed and cannot be understood by the server.
   - **401 Unauthorized:** The request requires user authentication.
   - **403 Forbidden:** The server understands the request but refuses to authorize it.
   - **404 Not Found:** The requested resource could not be found on the server.

5. **5xx (Server Error):** The server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request. The issue is on the server's side.
   - **500 Internal Server Error:** A generic error message, indicating that the server encountered an unexpected condition.
   - **503 Service Unavailable:** The server is currently unable to handle the request due to temporary overloading or maintenance.

Understanding and handling these HTTP status codes appropriately is crucial for web developers to ensure a smooth and reliable user experience. Proper management of these codes can help in debugging, improving performance, and enhancing the overall functionality of web applications.
