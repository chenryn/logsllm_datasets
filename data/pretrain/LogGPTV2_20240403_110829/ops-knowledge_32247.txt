Assistant: The HTTP status code is a numeric code returned by the server to the client to indicate the status of the server's response. Commonly used status codes include: 1xx (information): The server has received the request, but more information is needed to complete the processing. 2xx (success): The server successfully received, understood, and returned a response. - 200 OK: Indicates that the request is successful, and the response header or data body expected by the request will be returned with this response. - 201 Created: The request has been fulfilled, and a new resource has been created according to the request. - 204 No Content: Indicates that the server has successfully processed the request, but did not return any response content. 3xx (Redirect): Further action is required in order to complete the request. Common redirect status codes are: - 301 Moved Permanently: The requested resource has been permanently moved to a new location. - 302 Found: The requested resource is temporarily responding to the request from a different URI, but may return to the original location in the future. - 304 Not Modified: Indicates that the request sent by the client has been answered by the server, and the client can use the locally cached object. 4xx (client error): Indicates that an error occurred on the client side. Common status codes are: - 400 Bad Request: The server cannot handle the format of the request, and the client should not try to initiate a request with the same content again. - 401 Unauthorized: Indicates that the request requires HTTP authentication. - 403 Forbidden: The server has understood the request, but refuses to execute it. 5xx (Server Error): Indicates that an error occurred on the server side. Common status codes are: - 500 Internal Server Error: The server encountered an unexpected situation, which prevented it from completing the processing of the request. - 503 Service Unavailable: The server is busy and cannot process the request at this time. The above are common HTTP status codes and their corresponding error types. During web development, it is necessary to perform corresponding processing according to different status codes to improve user experience and performance.
