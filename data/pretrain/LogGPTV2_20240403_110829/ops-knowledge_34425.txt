User: How to use Ansible automation tools to manage and configure remote servers and network devices?
Assistant: The following are the steps to manage and configure remote servers and network devices using Ansible automation tools: 1. Install Ansible: First, you need to install Ansible on the management host and ensure the network connectivity with remote servers and devices. 2. Create host list files: In Ansible, host list files are used to define manageable hosts and network devices. You can list all host IP addresses in a file or create a dynamic list, which can be obtained in the real-time central database through plug-ins list of hosts. 3. Create Ansible Playbook: Playbook is a text file that defines Ansible tasks and configurations, and can be written in YAML format. Playbooks consist of a series of tasks and actions, specifying the steps and actions to be taken to configure and manage a remote server. 4. Write Ansible module: Ansible module is a collection of basic operations, which can execute Shell commands, configure software packages, create files and directories, execute complex scripts, etc. If you need to perform non-standard tasks, you can write your own Ansible modules. 5. Run Ansible: Use the ansible command to run the Playbook, and configure the remote hosts and network devices to be managed. After running a task, you can examine the results report, diagnose potential errors, and make changes. 6. Monitoring Ansible management: Ansible execution progress and results can be monitored using various tools, such as: web interface, email or logs. In summary, using Ansible can make it easier for IT administrators to manage and configure remote servers and network devices. By using Ansible automation tools, you can greatly increase production efficiency, reduce error rates, and improve management efficiency.
