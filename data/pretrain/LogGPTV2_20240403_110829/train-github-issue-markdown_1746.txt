On revision 134/135 (and maybe more versions but not on 131 and below) there
seems to be a slow glTF loading time with some glTF models.
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
  1. Go to donmccurdy's gltf-viewer.
  2. Click on the upload button.
  3. Select this file.
  4. Experience a huge lag.

  * Device: [Desktop]
  * OS: [Windows
  * Browser: [Chrome]
  * Three.js version: [r134, r135]
