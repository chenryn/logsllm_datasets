User: I'm building an app on GAE that needs to report on events occurring. An event has a type and I also need to report by event type.
For example, say there is an event A, B and C. They occur periodically at random. User logs in and creates a set of entities to which those events can be attributed. When the user comes back to check the status, I need to be able to tell how many events of A, B and/or C occurred during a specific time range, say a day or a month.
The 1000 limit is throwing a wrench into how I would normally do it. I don't need to retrieve all of the entities and present them to the user, but I do need to show the total count for a specific date range. Any suggestions?
I'm a bit of python/GAE noob...
