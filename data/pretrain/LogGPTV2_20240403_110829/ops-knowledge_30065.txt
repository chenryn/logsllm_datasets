User: If I open a a file as os.open( '/dev/ttyS2', O_RDWR | O_NDELAY ), is there any way that I can check when my 'write()' commands have finished? Or, can I open a file for non-blocking read but blocking write?
Assistant: Open two file descriptors to the same location - one for non-blocking reads and the other for blocking writes.
