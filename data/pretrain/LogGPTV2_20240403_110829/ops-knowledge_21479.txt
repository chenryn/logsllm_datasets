User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Win 7 laptop taking a long time to log on when off the domain I've clicked through on a few forums but unable to find a suggestion for this issue. I have a user with a HP laptop which will boot perfectly fine whilst connected to the network but at home it will take 4 minutes to log on. 

Some suggestions I have had is that its looking for the DNS server of the domain. Another was that it was suggested it was a roaming profile (it isn't).

So hoping someone has encountered Windows 7 acting like this and has some suggestions. The other users on this domain don't have the issue and its a mix of XP and Win 7 client PCs.

Assistant: Take a look at your logon scripts. Are they trying to access a network resource which isn't available when the machine in not connected to the domain network?

I've seen a similar problem during boot, which turned out to be a computer start up script trying to access a network resource that wasn't available offline.

Another option is to enable userenv logging to determine exactly what causes the delay.
