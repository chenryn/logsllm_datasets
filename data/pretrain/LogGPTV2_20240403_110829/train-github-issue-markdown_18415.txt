Subject: Inquiry About Developing Rust Bindings for TensorFlow

Dear TensorFlow Team,

I am writing to express my interest in developing Rust bindings for TensorFlow and to inquire about the feasibility of such a project. I have a few questions that I hope you can help me with:

1. Is there already an ongoing effort to create Rust bindings for TensorFlow? If so, would it be possible for me to contribute to this initiative?

2. If no such work is currently underway, would the TensorFlow team be open to the idea of integrating Rust support in the future? 

Given that the TensorFlow team may not be in a position to commit to supporting Rust at this time, I propose initiating this as a separate open-source project. This approach would allow for the development and refinement of the Rust bindings, with the possibility of merging them into the main TensorFlow repository at a later stage.

Thank you for considering my proposal. I look forward to your feedback and any guidance you might provide.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
