### Security Analysis and Instantiation

A semi-honest participant with a non-negligible advantage in distinguishing between real and simulated executions of P3MT would have the same advantage in distinguishing between real and simulated executions of APSI. Although APSI can be used as a black box, for efficiency reasons, we prefer instantiations that allow pre-computation on the server's input.

In our instantiation, we select the APSI construction from [15], which is proven secure under the RSA and DDH assumptions (in the Random Oracle Model, ROM).

#### PPGCT Security

The security of the PPGCT protocol (Section 4.3) against semi-honest adversaries relies on the security of the underlying PSI protocol, to which it is immediately reducible. In other words, a semi-honest participant with a non-negligible advantage in distinguishing between real and simulated executions of PPGCT would have the same advantage in distinguishing between real and simulated executions of PSI. Again, although one can use PSI as a black box, for efficiency reasons, we need PSI instantiations that allow pre-computation on the server's input, such as OPRF-based constructs [15, 16, 35, 41]. We chose the PSI from [41], which is proven secure under the One-More-DH assumption (in ROM).

### Conclusions and Future Work

This paper identified and explored three privacy-sensitive genomic applications: (i) paternity tests, (ii) personalized medicine, and (iii) genetic compatibility testing. Unlike most previous work, we focused on fully sequenced genomes, which pose new challenges in terms of both privacy and computational cost. For each application, we proposed an efficient construction based on well-known cryptographic tools: Private Set Intersection (PSI), Private Set Intersection Cardinality (PSI-CA), and Authorized Private Set Intersection (APSI). Experiments show that these protocols incur online overheads low enough to be practical today. In particular, our protocol for privacy-preserving paternity testing is significantly less expensive in both computation and communication compared to prior work. Furthermore, all protocols presented in this paper have been carefully constructed to mimic the state-of-the-art (in vitro) biological tests currently performed in hospitals and laboratories, based on STR and/or SNP comparison.

#### Future Work

Items for future work include, but are not limited to:

- **Privacy-Preserving Genetic Paternity Testing**: Introducing more advanced techniques.
- **Genetic Ancestry Testing**: Exploring privacy-preserving techniques to determine whether individuals are related up to a certain degree.
- **Paternity Test Protocol Extension**: Extending the protocol to allow both participants to verify the correctness of the other party's input according to some auxiliary authorization. (Note that APSI alone is insufficient since one party might alter its input to make the test negative.)
- **Additional Privacy-Sensitive Applications**: Investigating further applications for fully-sequenced genomes, such as certified forensic identification, where the subject must prove the authenticity of their input, and privacy-preserving organ recipient compatibility, where a subject efficiently identifies a matching sample without revealing information about their genome.
- **Secure Pattern Matching and Text Processing**: Extending our experiments to include the adaptation of secure pattern matching and text processing to personalized medicine and genetic compatibility testing on full genomes.
