a semi-honest participant with a non-negligible advantage in dis-
tinguishing between real and simulated executions of P3MT would
have the same advantage in distinguishing between real and simu-
lated executions of APSI. Although one can use APSI as a black
box, for efﬁciency reasons, we prefer instantiations that allow pre-
computation on Server input.
In our instantiation, we select the
APSI construction in [15], proven secure under the RSA and DDH
assumptions (in ROM).
PPGCT. Finally, security of the PPGCT protocol (Sec. 4.3) against
semi-honest adversaries relies on that of the underlying PSI pro-
tocol, to which it is immediately reducible.
(In other words, a
semi-honest participant with a non-negligible advantage in distin-
guishing between real and simulated executions of PPGCT would
have the same advantage in distinguishing between real and sim-
ulated executions of PSI.) Again, although one can use PSI as a
black box, for efﬁciency reasons, we need PSI instantiations that
allow pre-computation on Server input, such as OPRF-based con-
structs [15, 16, 35, 41]. We chose the PSI from [41], proven secure
under the One-More-DH assumption (in ROM).
6. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
This paper identiﬁed and explored three popular privacy-sensitive
genomic applications: (i) paternity tests, (ii) personalized medicine
and (iii) genetic compatibility testing. Unlike most previous work,
we focused on fully sequenced genomes. This scenario poses new
challenges, both in terms of privacy and computational cost. For
each application, we proposed an efﬁcient construction, based on
well-known cryptographic tools: Private Set Intersection (PSI), Pri-
vate Set Intersection Cardinality (PSI-CA), and Authorized Private
Set Intersection (APSI). Experiments show that these protocols in-
cur online overhead sufﬁciently low to be practical today. In partic-
ular, our protocol for privacy-preserving paternity testing is signif-
icantly less expensive — in both computation and communication
— than prior work. Furthermore, all protocols presented in this
paper have been carefully constructed to mimic the state-of-the-art
of (in vitro) biological tests currently performed in hospitals and
laboratories.
on STR and/or SNP comparison.
Items for future work include, but are not limited to:
• Introducing privacy-preserving genetic paternity testing based
• Exploring privacy-preserving techniques to realize genetic
ancestry testing, i.e., to discover whether or not individuals
are related up to a certain degree.5
• Extending the paternity test protocol to allow both partici-
pants to determine whether the other party introduced correct
input according to some auxiliary authorization. (Note that
APSI does not sufﬁce since one of the parties might alter its
input so that the test is negative).
• Investigation of additional privacy-sensitive applications for
fully-sequenced genomes, such as certiﬁed forensic identi-
ﬁcation, where the subject of investigation must prove the
authenticity of its input; privacy-preserving organ recipients
compatibility, where a subject efﬁciently identiﬁes a match-
ing sample without revealing information about her genome.
• Extending our experiments to include adaptation of secure
pattern matching and text processing to personalized medi-
cine and genetic compatibility testing on full genomes.
