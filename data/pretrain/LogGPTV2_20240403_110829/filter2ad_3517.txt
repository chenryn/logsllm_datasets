## Introduction

The 3rd Workshop on Recent Advances in Intrusion-Tolerant Systems, held in conjunction with DSN 2009, aims to provide a platform for researchers and practitioners to discuss and collaborate on groundbreaking ideas and new results in the field of intrusion tolerance (IT). 

Intrusion tolerance begins with the premise that software-based systems inevitably have bugs and misconfigurations. Furthermore, today's distributed and networked computer systems make it easier to discover, expose, and exploit these flaws. IT acknowledges that it is impossible to completely prevent intrusions and attacks, and often difficult to accurately detect and stop them early enough. Therefore, intrusion-tolerant systems must be able to continue operating correctly despite attacks and intrusions, and deny attackers as much success as possible.

For example, an intrusion-tolerant system may suffer a loss of service or resources due to an attack but can continue to provide critical services in a degraded mode or trigger automatic mechanisms to regain and recover compromised services and resources. Other related research areas include survivability, trustworthy systems, Byzantine fault tolerance, and autonomic self-healing systems.

The idea of tolerating intrusions gained prominence in the 1990s, especially after thorough evaluations of intrusion detection systems revealed significant problems with false positives and false negatives. Around 2000, major research efforts were launched in the United States and Europe. These and other affiliated projects led to the development of several intrusion-tolerant algorithms and architectures. It is now possible to start grasping the fundamental principles of building practical intrusion-tolerant systems, the issues underlying their validation and certification, and the effective and intelligent management, maintenance, and operation of such systems once they are in operation.

Despite significant progress, the vision that most current systems will be built as intrusion-tolerant systems has not yet become a reality. There are several reasons for this, including a false sense of security, a lack of understanding of the risks, the absence of any major, publicly acknowledged cyber-disaster, and the perception that intrusion tolerance is expensive. On the other hand, intrusion tolerance is a moving target that has not been completely achieved yet. Unlike fault tolerance, intrusion tolerance faces an intelligent adversary who can adapt and evolve as the system adapts and recovers. New technologies make older solutions obsolete and introduce new vulnerabilities. How can we make intrusion tolerance an integral part of the system developers' and architects' mindset? How can we stay ahead of increasingly sophisticated adversaries? How can we empower practitioners to navigate the ever-changing technology landscape so that they can build systems that can be trusted and operate through attacks?

## This Year’s Workshop

The goal of this year’s workshop is to understand, disseminate, cross-pollinate, and collaborate on the challenges of building intrusion-tolerant systems and innovative ideas to address them. As a technical area, IT is at the intersection of fault tolerance and security. As a practical discipline, it brings in additional topics ranging from software engineering and adaptive system development to reasoning, coordination, and control of distributed resources and mechanisms, as well as the validation and evaluation of security and survivability claims.

This year’s workshop includes a selection of six high-quality papers that provide a rich combination of perspectives on intrusion tolerance.

1. **"What Next in Intrusion Tolerance"** by P. Pal, R. Schantz, J. Loyall, M. Atighetchi, and F. Webber from BBN Technologies. This paper looks into the near future and analyzes the challenges that new technologies like SOA, cloud computing, and the semantic web pose to intrusion tolerance. The paper opens interesting new directions for research in the area.

2. **"Quantitative Approach to Tuning of a Time-Based Intrusion-Tolerant System Architecture"** by Q. Nguyen and A. Sood from George Mason University. This paper addresses the important issue of time-based intrusion tolerance by quantitatively analyzing how their Self-Cleansing Intrusion Tolerance (SCIT) architecture can be tuned to attain a certain level of resilience.

3. **"Network Intrusion Detection with Minimal Communication Overhead"** by O. Kreidl and A. Willsky from MIT. This paper provides a probabilistic model of network intrusion detection with limited communication between local detectors. This model allows for making an accurate estimate of the threshold used at a node to determine if an attack is in progress.

4. **"On the Use of Radio Resource Tests in Wireless Ad Hoc Networks"** by D. Mónica, J. Leitão, L. Rodrigues, and C. Ribeiro from INESC-ID/IST. This paper deals with a particularly pernicious form of intrusions in wireless environments, specifically the falsification of identities or "Sybil attacks." The paper defines a framework to assess the power and performance of radio resource tests (RRTs) and uses the framework to compare a set of RRTs.

5. **"Enhancing Fault/Intrusion Tolerance through Design and Configuration Diversity"** by a team of researchers from several institutions: A. Bessani, A. Daidone, I. Gashi, R. Obelheiro, P. Sousa, and V. Stankovic. This paper reports results from project FOREVER about the use of diversity to obtain intrusion tolerance. The paper presents a set of mechanisms that allow creating diversity and evaluates the benefits obtained.

6. **"Practical Techniques for Regeneration and Immunization of COTS Applications"** by L. Li, R. Sekar, M. Cornwell, E. Hultman, and J. Just from Global InfoTek and Stony Brook University. This paper presents RAMSES, a novel system for making software applications immune to a large number of current attacks. The idea is to instrument the software with lightweight code that checks if input reaches resources when that was not expected by the programmer.

We expect the discussions around these papers to identify open problems and fundamental issues in IT that still need research, bring forward innovative ideas to address them, and broaden our understanding of the issues that prevent IT technologies from being widely adopted in operational and deployed systems. This includes identifying the domains that stand to benefit most, evaluating IT systems for deployment, and cost-effective management and maintenance of operational IT systems.
