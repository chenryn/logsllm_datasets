**Current behavior**
When using the currency pipe to format a number specifying the valid ISO 4217
currency code for South Africa 'ZAR' and setting the SymbolDisplay to true the
currency code is not replaced by the currency symbol, in this case 'R'.
**Expected behavior**
The expected behavior is for the projected property to display the currency
symbol instead of the currency code when symbolDisplay is true and
currencyCode is set to 'ZAR'.
**Minimal reproduction of the problem with instructions**
{{someamount | currency:'ZAR':true:'1.2-2'}}
**What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**
We need to format currency with the South African currency symbol.
