Hi guys!
Hope you can explain us some strange behavior that we are already solved in
our ugly way.
We had some periodic tasks that used default queue `celery`. We have changed
`CELERY_DEFAULT_QUEUE` to non-default. We using following configuration:
Django + Celery + Redis. We using `celerybeat-schedule` file by default and
it's wasn't ever cleaned. Also we didn't clear Redis after changing that
variable.  
So we faced with that error and researched that our Redis raised up to limits
of `used_memory` and our previous default queue `celery` was about 500Mb. So
it's looks like it contains only periodic tasks and queue always growing up
and never consumed by workers.
So our dirty solution: we manually cleaned `celery` queue from Redis and
deleted one `celery\x06\x16\x06\x16celery` value from `_kombu.binding.celery`
set in Redis. So it's looks like fixed now.
Could you please explain or give us any feedback about the reasons and any
kind of solution about this issue.
Kind regards,  
Alexander
