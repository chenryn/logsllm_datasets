I noticed that `ByteSizeValue` allows any input value, including negative
values.  
When it comes to serializing it though, we use `writeVLong` which starts with
an assertion `assert i >= 0;`. I suspect this is the reason why in some cases
we do not use `ByteSizeValue` instance but plain long values instead, in
places like `OsStats` (because we default to `-1` which cannot be serialized)
and we end up creating a new `ByteSizeValue` instance on demand for each get
call.
Should we change the way we serialize it or shall we introduce some validation
at construction time in `ByteSizeValue`?
