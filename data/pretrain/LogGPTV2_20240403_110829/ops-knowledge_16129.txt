It seems like it's looking for log.ibd in raspberrypints but that file is not there. I'm not sure where to go from here.

Assistant: Looks like you have a database corruption occurred with data stored in InnoDB engine. It could be that you still can recover from it, there are a lot of guides available on the network: example 1, example 2.
