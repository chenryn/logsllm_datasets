### Organizational Security Measures

The adoption of organizational security measures, such as incident response plans (O.R. = 1.36), regular enforcement of information security policies (O.R. = 1.08), information security training for staff (O.R. = 1.14), and emergency drills (O.R. = 1.17), was found to be consistent across companies of different sizes. Interestingly, the prevalence of risk analyses and information security certifications did not vary by company size. This could be attributed to the fact that certain industries, such as finance and health, are legally required to obtain information security certifications, regardless of their size.

Companies that engaged external information security providers were more likely to implement information security policies or incident response plans (O.R. = 1.31) and conduct regular emergency drills (O.R. = 0.80). Similarly, companies with international locations were more likely to deploy written security policies or incident response plans (O.R. = 1.38), security certifications (O.R. = 1.27), enforce these policies (O.R. = 1.29), and provide security training (O.R. = 1.49).

For companies with multiple national branches, there was a higher likelihood of conducting regular risk analyses (O.R. = 1.19), implementing written security policies or incident response plans (O.R. = 1.58), and enforcing these policies (O.R. = 1.34).

Risk perception, particularly in the context of targeted attacks, correlated with the implementation of written information security policies or incident response plans (O.R. = 1.17), obtaining information security certifications (O.R. = 1.16), conducting risk analyses (O.R. = 1.12), providing information security training (O.R. = 1.11), and executing emergency simulations or drills (O.R. = 1.18). Conversely, risk perception in the context of mass attacks was associated with a lower likelihood of having information security certifications or performing risk analyses.

Additionally, the number of technical staff in a company correlated with the reporting of policy enforcement and compliance (O.R. = 1.37) and the execution of emergency drills (O.R. = 1.20).

Industry sector also played a significant role in the adoption of organizational security measures. For instance, the finance and insurance sector had the highest odds ratios for five out of six organizational measures, including information security policies and incident response plans (O.R. = 6.43), enforcement of these plans (O.R. = 7.20), regular risk analyses (O.R. = 7.27), security training (O.R. = 13.85), and the deployment of emergency drills (O.R. = 16.09). This can be attributed to the stringent security requirements in these sectors, often mandated by law.

### Summary: Organizational Security Measures
Organizational security measures have lower adoption rates in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). However, company size correlates with all organizational security measures included in our analysis. Companies in the finance and energy sectors are most likely to employ these measures.

### Reported Incidents
Participants were asked to report security incidents detected and responded to within the last 12 months, excluding incidents automatically handled by anti-virus software or spam filters. Approximately 45.1% of participants reported that their company had to actively respond to at least one incident in the past year, with more than half (1,842) experiencing multiple attacks.

Figure 5 illustrates the distribution of reported incidents across different industry sectors. Some attack types, such as CEO-Fraud, DDoS, defacing, manual hacking, phishing, ransomware, and spyware & other malware, were more frequently reported in specific sectors.

Companies with multiple national locations were more likely to report incidents involving ransomware (O.R. = 1.58), spyware & other malware (O.R. = 1.21), manual hacking/advanced persistent threats (O.R. = 2.03), DDoS (O.R. = 1.36), CEO-fraud (O.R. = 1.29), and phishing (O.R. = 1.24).

The presence of information security policies or incident response plans (O.R. 1.21–2.98) was associated with a higher likelihood of reporting phishing, CEO-fraud, defacing, or ransomware attacks. However, active enforcement of these plans was linked to a lower likelihood of reporting attacks in all categories except DDoS (O.R. 0.57–0.91).

Export activity was positively correlated with the reporting of spyware and other malware (O.R. 1.27).

Including the industry sector as a non-optional factor in the regression analyses increased the AIC by no more than 4%, which was deemed acceptable. The industry sector mapped to some reported incident types. For example, ransomware was less frequently reported in the transportation sector (O.R. 0.52) compared to the baseline, while DDoS was more frequently reported in the communication sector (O.R. 4.34). Defacing incidents were more common in the water & waste and communication sectors (O.R. 5.73 and 4.34), CEO-Fraud in the energy & gas and "other services" sectors (O.R. 2.34), and phishing in the vehicle retail sector (O.R. 1.60).

### Summary: Detected Incidents
Organizational measures were more frequently associated with the reporting of security incidents compared to technical security measures. Larger companies, especially those with technical departments, reported more incidents. The industry sector also correlated with the reporting of security incidents.

### Future Work and Recommendations
Our findings suggest that companies, particularly those in specific industry sectors, may require stronger protection and security measures. Public administration and agriculture & fishing companies, for example, reported fewer ransomware attacks. Companies with larger technical departments and those with multiple locations reported more incidents, possibly due to a larger attack surface. The deployment of security policies might help in detecting incidents but does not necessarily prevent them. Future work should focus on enhancing the effectiveness of these measures and tailoring them to the specific needs of different industry sectors.
