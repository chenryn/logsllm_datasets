and incident response plans (O.R. = 1.36), regular enforce-
ment of information security policies (O.R. = 1.08), infor-
mation security training for their staff (O.R. = 1.14), and
practicing emergency drills (O.R. = 1.17). Interestingly, the
reported prevalence of risk analyses and information security
certiﬁcations did not vary by company size. An explanation
could be that information security certiﬁcations are required
by law for companies in certain industry sectors like ﬁnances
and health, which typically have fewer staff.
The use of external information security providers corre-
lated with the deployment of two organizational information
security measures. Companies that relied on external informa-
tion security providers were more likely to deploy information
security policies or incident response plans (O.R. = 1.31), and
regular emergency drills (O.R. = 0.80).
Companies with international locations were more likely to
deploy written security policies or incident response (O.R. =
1.38), security certiﬁcation (O.R. = 1.27), security policy en-
forcement (O.R. = 1.29) and security training (O.R. = 1.49).
Similarly, companies with more than one national branch,
were more likely to deploy regular risk analyses (O.R. = 1.19),
written security policies or incident response plans (O.R. =
1.58) and enforcement of these policies (O.R. = 1.34).
We included the risk perception (cf. Section 4.2) as an
optional factor in the regression analysis. We ﬁnd that risk
perception in the context of targeted attacks correlated with
the reporting of a written information security policy or in-
cident response plan (O.R. = 1.17), for information security
certiﬁcation (O.R. = 1.16), risk analysis (O.R. = 1.12), infor-
mation security training (O.R. = 1.11) and the execution of
emergency simulations or drills (O.R. = 1.18). On the other
hand, risk perception in the context of mass attacks correlated
with a lower likelihood for that company to have information
security certiﬁcation or perform risk analysis.
We also found that the number of tech staff in compa-
nies correlated with the reporting of policy enforcement
and compliance (O.R. = 1.37) as well as emergency drills
(O.R. = 1.20).
Similar to technical security measures, the industry sector
correlated with the reporting of organizational measures. A
potential explanation can be law requirements for as well
as requirements and technological afﬁnity of different sec-
tors. For example, companies in the ﬁnances & insurance
sector have strong security requirements [8]. This sector
holds the highest odds ratio in ﬁve of six organizational mea-
sures, including for information security policies and incident
response plans (O.R. = 6.43), for the enforcement of these
plans (O.R. = 7.20), in regular risk analyses (O.R. = 7.27), in
security training (O.R. = 13.85), and for the deployment of
emergency drills (O.R. = 16.09).
Summary: Organisational Security Measures. Organiza-
tional measures have lower adoption rates in SMEs. How-
ever, we ﬁnd that company size correlates with all orga-
nizational security measures we included in our analysis.
Companies in the ﬁnance and energy sector are most likely
to employ organizational security measures.
4.4 Reported Incidents
We asked participants to report the security incidents their
company detected and reacted to in the last 12 months. We
explicitly asked participants not to report incidents that could

be dealt with automatically, e. g., spam e-mails that were au-
tomatically blocked using anti-virus software or spam ﬁlters.
45.1% of the participants reported that their company had to
actively react to at least one incident in the last 12 months.
More than half of them (1,842) were attacked multiple times.
Figure 5 illustrates the reported incidents. We ﬁnd that while
some attack-types are evenly distributed across industry sec-
tors, some types of attacks were more frequently reported for
certain industry sectors.
We speciﬁcally asked interviewees to report on CEO-Fraud,
DDoS, defacing, manual hacking, phishing, ransomware, and
spyware & other malware (cf. Table 7 for ransomware and
CEO-Fraud). The remaining regression analyses are listed in
the Appendix (cf. Table 17–21).
We ﬁnd that multiple national company locations corre-
lated with the reporting of incidents including ransomware
(O.R. = 1.58), spyware & other malware (O.R. = 1.21),
manual hacking/advanced persistent threat (O.R. = 2.03),
DDoS (O.R. = 1.36), CEO-fraud (O.R. = 1.29) and phish-
ing (O.R. = 1.24).
Furthermore, companies that report information security
policies or incident response plans (O.R. 1.21–2.98) corre-
lated with the reporting of phishing, CEO-fraud, defacing, or
ransomware attack. Participants who reported active enforce-
ment of these plans were less likely to report attacks in all
categories except for DDoS (O.R. 0.57–0.91).
Reporting export activity was positively correlated with
reporting spyware and other malware (O.R. 1.27).
To further explore trends in Figure 5, we included the indus-
try sector as a non-optional factor in the regression analyses
which increased the AIC by no more than 4% across all inci-
dent models, which we deemed acceptable for the analysis.
We ﬁnd that the industry sector only map to some reported

incident types. This included ransomware, that was less fre-
quently reported in the transportation sector (O.R. 0.52) com-
pared to the baseline and DDoS, that was more frequently
reported in the communication sector than in the baseline
(O.R. 4.34). Defacing incidents were more frequently re-
ported both in the water & waste and communication sectors
(O.R. 5.73 and 4.34), CEO-Fraud, was more frequently re-
ported in the energy & gas and “other services” sectors (O.R.
2.34 both) and ﬁnally phishing, was more frequently reported
for the vehicle retail sector (O.R. 1.60).
Summary: Detected Incidents. We found that organizational
measures more frequently map to the reporting of security
incidents than reported technical security measurements.
We ﬁnd that larger companies, especially with tech depart-
ments reported more incidents. Finally, our ﬁndings sug-
gest that the industry sector correlated with the reporting of
security incidents.

Together with the previously discussed low perceived risk of
targeted cyberattacks, this might make companies particularly
vulnerable to attacks like CEO-Fraud and insider-threats.
RQ3. “Which types and frequencies of attacks have our par-
ticipating companies detected within the last 12 months?”
Most companies reported incidents such as phishing and mal-
ware. CEO-Fraud and (D)DoS attacks also appeared to be
more common problems. Defacing and manual hacking, on
the other hand, were rarely reported. However, the reporting
of our interviewees does not allow us to clearly distinguish
between mass and targeted attacks.
RQ4. “How are deployed security measures and company
characteristics related to reported incidents and what are
the emerging victimization factors?” We found that intervie-
wees working in particular industry sectors more frequently
reported certain types of incidents: CEO-Fraud (D: Energy
and Gas), (D)DoS (J: Communication), and defacing (B:
Mining). Hence, while more incidents could just be the re-
sult of better detection, we still think companies in those
industry sectors might require stronger protection and secu-
rity measures, and should receive special attention in relation
to the speciﬁc threats they are facing. Similarly, interviewees
working in Public administration and Agriculture & Fishing
companies reported ransomware attacks less frequently. We
ﬁnd that interviewees working for companies with larger tech
departments more frequently reported incidents. We also ﬁnd
that interviewees working in companies that more frequently
deployed technical security measures did not report more se-
curity incidents. However, the reporting of organizational
measures correlated with the reporting of certain types of
incidents. Company demographics such as international ac-
tivity and company size also contributed to more frequently
reported incidents by interviewees. This also relates to the
more frequent reporting of incidents by interviewees work-
ing for companies with multiple locations. Companies with
multiple locations reported more manual hacking incidents.
The distributed infrastructure of multiple location companies
might increase the attack surface and attract manual hack-
ing attempts. Insider threats and advanced persistent threats
could exploit the distributed nature of these companies. In-
terviewees working for companies with information security
policies or incident response plans more frequently reported
certain types of incidents including ransomware, phishing
and defacing. The deployment of security policies might con-
tribute to detect incidents such as ransomware, phishing and
defacing more frequently, but does not seem to prevent these
types of incidents.
5.2 Future Work and Recommendations
As described in Section 4, we identiﬁed different characteris-
tics that contributed to the reported sensitivity and risk percep-
