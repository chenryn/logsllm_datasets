We have developed a simple application and used the Google App Engine Launcher (GAEL) to run it locally. Subsequently, we deployed the application using GAEL to our app ID, and it is functioning as expected.

Next, we created a web service, which we also tested locally using GAEL along with a minimal local Python client. The local testing was successful.

However, after deploying the web service, we encountered an issue. When we attempt to visit the default page, we receive the following message: "Move along people, there is nothing to see here."

To further investigate, we modified our local Python client to interact with the deployed web service. This resulted in an error indicating that the response type was "text/plain" instead of the expected "text/xml."

We are unsure where the problem lies in our deployment or configuration for using a web service with Google App Engine. Any insights or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Update:
Unfortunately, we were unable to pinpoint the exact cause of the issue due to insufficient debugging information. However, we managed to implement a workaround for the web service, even though the root cause remains undetermined.
