Table 6. Children’s Password Habits 
While more than 92% of each group reported that they keep 
their  passwords  private,  ES  reported  significantly  lower 
percentage compared to MS (χ2 =	18.18, df = 1)  and to HS 
(χ2 =	47.21, df = 1). However, as children age from ES to MS, 
more that they “share passwords with friends” (χ2 =	60.68, df 
to  HS,  they  progressively  reported  significantly  more  and 
= 2). The use of same password for everything also increases 
significantly from ES, to MS, to HS (χ2 =	149.02, df = 2). ES 
compared to MS (χ2 =	29.59, df = 1) and to HS (χ2 =	29.06, 
reported  “change  passwords”  significantly 
less  often 
df = 1). The two primary reasons (over 60 %) for changing 
passwords  are  “when  I  forgot  my  passwords”  and  “when 
someone finds out my passwords.” All age groups reported a 
very high rate (more than 92%) of signing out after use. 
4.3.2  Password Selection & Storage 
When  asked  how  they  get  their  passwords,  all  are  given 
passwords by their schools at very high rates as over 80% as 
summarized in Table 7.

Table 7. “How do you get your passwords?” 
As shown in Table 7, younger students (ES) reported having 
significantly  more  parental  involvement  in  creating  their 
passwords.  Students  having  passwords  made  by  parents 
decrease significantly from ES to MS, to HS (χ2 =	209.07, df 
=	179.13, df = 2). And, students making their own passwords 
increase significantly from ES to MS, to HS (χ2 =	311.09, df 
= 2). Similarly,  students making their own passwords with 
parents’ help decrease significantly from ES to MS, to HS (χ2 
= 2).  
Figure  2  shows  how  students  remember  passwords.  More 
than  89  %  of  participants  across  age  groups  reported 
memorizing their passwords as a strategy for remembering 
passwords.

1).  As  children  age,  their  relying  on  family  members  to 
remember their passwords significantly decreases from ES 
Both  MS  and  HS  were  asked  an  additional  question  on 
whether  they  help  their  family  members  with  passwords.  
About 47 % of MS and 34 % of HS chose “Yes.” Of those 
who chose “Yes,” the primary assistance they provided was 
to “Help family members remember passwords”–MS (68.86 
%) and HS (78.01 %).  
4.3.3  Created Password Analysis 
The three groups were asked to create a password: “Let’s say 
you just got a new game to play on the computer, but you 
need a password to use it. Please make up a new password 
for that game. (Remember, don’t write down one of your real 
passwords.)” 
Password Characteristics  
On average, students created passwords about 10 characters 
long  (ES:  9.90  characters,  MS:  10.42  characters,  and  HS: 
10.44 characters). Using the Mann-Whitney U test , ES was 
found creating significantly shorter passwords, compared to 
MS (z  = -3.23) and HS (z = -4.75).  
Figure 3 shows the distribution of different character types 
used in the passwords created by the participants. Lowercase 
letters make up the majority of the passwords, followed by 
numbers.  ES  used  significantly  fewer  lowercase  letters, 
compared to MS (z = -3.44) and HS (z = -5.42). ES used 
significantly more numbers than MS  (z = 2.52)  and HS (z = 
2.40). Across all age groups, symbols or white spaces were 
rarely used.

Figure 3. Character Types in Passwords (in %) 
We  further  examined  character  type  positioning  in  the 
passwords. Figures 4, 5, and 6 display the overall character 
type distributions relative to their positions in the passwords, 
for  password  lengths  of  9  (median)  for  ES,  and  password 
lengths of 10 (median) for MS and HS. 
As  shown  in  Figure  4,  ES  predominantly  used  lowercase 
letters and numbers. They tend to start their passwords with 
numbers or uppercase letters in the 1st position. Immediately 
after  the  1st  position,  the  remaining  positions,  lowercase 
letters were used predominantly (about 50 %) and numbers 
were used between 39 % and 46 %.

Figure 4. Character Types by Positions in Passwords (ES) 
(in %; L – lowercase, U – uppercase, N – numbers) 
In contrast, the patterns for MS (Figure 5) and HS (Figure 6) 
look quite different from ES. Both MS and HS also tend to 
start their passwords with uppercase letters (about 55%), but 
numbers are not as prevalent in the first position as for ES. 
We  observe  a  decreasing  use  of  lowercase  and  increasing 
trend of using numbers as the position gets higher.
