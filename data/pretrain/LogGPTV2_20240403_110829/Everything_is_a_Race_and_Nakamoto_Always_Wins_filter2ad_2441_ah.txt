D.1 The adversary tree via branching random
walks
We first give a description of the (dual of the) adversary tree in
terms of a Branching Random Walk (BRW). Such a representation
appears already in [Pit94, Drm09], but we use here the standard
language from, e.g., [Aïd13, Shi15].
Consider the collection of k tuples of positive integers, Ik =
{(i1, . . . , ik)}, and set I = ∪k >0Ik. We consider elements of I as
labelling the vertices of a rooted infinite tree, with Ik labelling the
vertices at generation k as follows: the vertex v = (i1, . . . , ik) ∈ Ik
is the ik-th child of vertex (i1, . . . , ik−1) at level k−1. An example of
labelling is given in Figure 7. For such v we also let v j = (i1, . . . , ij),
j = 1, . . . , k, denote the ancestor of v at level j, with vk = v. For
notation convenience, we set v
0 = 0 as the root of the tree.

Next, let {Ev}v ∈I be an i.i.d. family of exponential random
variables of parameter λa. For v = (i1, . . . , ik) ∈ Ik, let Wv =
j ≤k Wv j . This creates a labelled
tree, with the following interpretation: for v = (i1, . . . , ij), the Wv j
are the waiting for v j to appear, measured from the appearance
of v j−1, and Sv is the appearance time of v. A moments thought
ought to convince the reader that the tree Sv is a description of the
adversary tree, sorted by depth.

It remains to show that P(E0|U0) > 0. We have

Note that Lemmas D.1, D.2 and (56) imply in particular that
D0(t) ≤ eλat for all large t, a.s., and also that
if eλa > λh then D0(t) > λht for all large t, a.s..
(57)
With all these preparations, we can give a simple proof for
Lemma 4.7.
Proof. We use a simple upper bound. Note that by (56),
P(D0(t) ≥ m) = P(S
