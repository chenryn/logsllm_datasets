The propagation of a BGP message is inﬂuenced by iBGP (to transfer the message
from the egress router to the interconnection point), and eBGP (to transfer the message
between the interconnection routers). Juniper routers use an “out-delay” timer to avoid
sending updates too often. eBGP sessions may also apply the “route-ﬂap damping”
mechanism upon the reception of BGP messages coming from an external neighbor.
Another important factor is router load. A measurement study of BGP “pass-through”
times [9] showed that the number of preﬁxes advertised in a BGP session and the num-
ber of BGP peers are key contributors to router load. Propagation time also depends on
other properties such as network propagation delay and route reﬂector hierarchy, but
neither are relevant here.
The propagation time from GEANT to Abilene has two main components: an out-
delay and a load-related delay. GEANT sets the out-delay at the interconnection sessions

10 seconds at (NL,NY) and 30 seconds at (DE2,WA). The worst-case scenario for the
transfer delay would be a reset of one of the sessions with GEANT’s providers. In this
case, the transfer of the 170, 000 routes to one iBGP neighbor should take around 3 min-
utes [1]. If the router issuing the updates is CPU bound, which is usually the case when
it has to treat a large number of updates, then it will send updates to each neighbor se-
quentially. If the BGP monitor was the last iBGP neighbor to receive the updates, then
it would only receive an update reporting a change after all the other 21 neighbors (i.e.,
21×3 minutes after the interconnection point received the change). Therefore, we bound
the propagation time of events from GEANT to Abilene with a one-hour time window.
The time window for the propagation of routing events from Abilene to GEANT is
mainly determined by route-ﬂap damping imposed by GEANT at the reception of up-
dates from Abilene. GEANT sets the maximum delay introduced by route-ﬂap damping
mechanism according to the RIPE recommendations [10] (i.e., 30, 45, and 60 minutes
for short, medium, and long preﬁxes). Abilene does not set the out-delay timers and
there is little load-related delay (Abilene’s largest BGP session is with GEANT, and it
only has 2, 200 preﬁxes). Therefore, we use an adaptive time window that depends on
the preﬁx length: TA,G is 1820 seconds, if preﬁx is shorter than /22; 2720 seconds, if
preﬁx is /22 or /23; and 3620 seconds, if preﬁx is longer than /24.
5 Analysis of Route Propagation
We now analyze each pair of BGP routing changes from Abilene to GEANT, and vice-
versa, correlated according to the methodology described in Section 4. First, we char-
acterize which kinds of BGP routing changes are more frequent and therefore have a
more signiﬁcant impact between Abilene and GEANT. Then, we quantify the route
propagation time.
5.1 Classiﬁcation of Propagated Routes
Table 2 presents the number of BGP routing changes per type as deﬁned in Section 4.1.
The ﬁrst half of the table presents the number of BGP routing changes at the source AS.
The second half quantiﬁes the impact of these changes on the destination AS.

Abilene experienced 48, 296 BGP routing changes that could potentially impact
GEANT during the measurement period, whereas GEANT only experienced 14, 123
BGP routing changes that could impact Abilene. This difference is explained by a com-
bination of two factors: (i) the number of preﬁxes in PA→G is more than twice the
number in PG→A, and (ii) Abilene does not apply any delay to ﬁlter BGP messages,
which leads to a higher number of BGP routing changes. Both sets of results show that
preﬁx up and down events dominate the routing changes of each network (these events
represent 85.7% of events at Abilene and 74.6% at GEANT).
The ﬁrst line of Table 2 shows that there were 19, 109 preﬁx-down events at Abilene
that could impact GEANT, but that less than half of those (9, 132) actually triggered a
BGP routing change at GEANT. One reason is that the route-ﬂap damping mechanism
applied by GEANT ﬁlters many of these events. Another reason is that GEANT can
also reach most preﬁxes that it learns from Abilene using its own connection to the
commercial Internet. If GEANT is not using the route via Abilene, then the loss of
reachability in Abilene does not impact GEANT.
Given the limited number of alternative paths that Abilene has to reach the preﬁxes
announced by GEANT and vice-versa, most egress-set changes at the source AS have
no impact at the destination. In particular, Abilene has almost no alternative to reach
the preﬁxes announced by GEANT (PG→A). Therefore, even when a preﬁx goes down
or if GEANT changes to a worse route, Abilene routers have no alternative but to lose
connectivity to the preﬁx or still select the route they learn from GEANT, respectively.
There are only 94 instances in which a preﬁx down at GEANT caused Abilene to replace
its egress set to the preﬁx. We have veriﬁed some of these events manually and observed
that Abilene and GEANT have some common peers (mainly research and educational
networks in Latin America, Asia-Paciﬁc region, and Africa). Some preﬁxes are multi-
homed to GEANT and to one of these other peers. Abilene uses either one of the routes
to reach these preﬁxes, and events at GEANT cannot impact Abilene when it is using
the route via the other peer. This behavior explains why only 1, 600 out of the 4, 318
preﬁx down at GEANT trigger a change in Abilene.
Table 2 illustrates the types of routing changes that propagate between these two aca-
demic peers. We expect the types of routing changes to vary substantially for different
pairs of neighboring ASes, because of their relationship, the number of connections to
their neighbors, and their location in the Internet hierarchy. GEANT and Abilene ex-
perience mostly gain or loss of reachability (or, “preﬁx up” and “preﬁx down”). Both
networks are fairly small and are close to the edge networks, which implies that they
are closer to the network that originates the BGP routing change and that there is less
aggregation of preﬁxes. These results are in sharp contrast with the 6.0% of loss/gain
of reachability measured at a tier-1 ISP network [3]. The majority of events at the tier-1
network were distant/transient disruptions, which we classify as egress-set changes.
5.2 Propagation Time
We estimate the propagation time of a routing change to a preﬁx p between Abilene
and GEANT by comparing the time BGP monitors at each network receive the ﬁrst
BGP message that reports the routing change to p. We compute the propagation time

time at destination AS - time at source AS
Fig. 2. Propagation time of routing changes
from a source to a destination AS as the difference between the time of the BGP routing
change at the destination and the time at the source. Figure 2 presents the cumulative
distribution of the propagation time of all correlated BGP routing changes. (Note that
the x-axis is in log scale.)
Although the propagation time in both directions is less than one minute for approx-
imately half of the correlated BGP routing changes, the shapes of the curves are strik-
ingly different. Abilene does not use out delay, therefore over 35% of GEANT BGP
routing changes triggered by Abilene happen within the ﬁrst second in GEANT. The
linear increase of the propagation time is an effect of a combination of the route-ﬂap
damping mechanism to enter GEANT, and of other load-related variations (as examined
in [9]). The propagation time reaches a plateau at around 30 minutes, which we suspect
is due to false matches (there are less than 2% of correlated events with more than 30
minutes propagation time).
On the other hand, the analysis of the propagation time from GEANT to Abilene
shows that almost all BGP routing changes from GEANT take at least 10 seconds
to reach Abilene. Indeed, the distribution of propagation time has two distinguishable
steps at 10 and 30 seconds, which correspond to the out delay of 10 seconds imposed
by GEANT at the NL router and of 30 seconds at DE2. The propagation time of almost
half of BGP routing changes from GEANT to Abilene is determined by these timers.
The slow increasing slope is due to the interaction of a number of factors: TCP behavior
at the BGP session, the CPU load at the border router, and the number of BGP messages
triggered by each BGP routing change.
We examined the small steps in the distribution from GEANT to Abilene that ap-
pear around 3, 7, and 40 minutes propagation times. We found that all of these steps
correspond to BGP session resets. A session reset triggers a large number of BGP mes-
sages. All these messages reach the neighboring AS at approximately the same time,
and consequently have similar propagation times. We conjecture that the few BGP rout-
ing changes with propagation time over 30 minutes are due to the load in the GEANT
20

router that ﬁrst experiences the change (as discussed in Section 4). If the BGP monitor
is among the ﬁrst peers to be notiﬁed of a large session reset and the interconnection
points to Abilene are among the last ones, we expect time lags even larger than 30
minutes. For instance, the sharp increase in the time propagation distribution around 40
minutes from GEANT to Abilene happens because of the re-establishment of a session
with one of the providers. Certainly, 40 minutes of propagation time between neighbor-
ing networks is extremely large, but also rare. This example illustrates the importance
of taking into account the router load as a factor of propagation time. Events such as
session resets or hot-potato routing changes can trigger thousands of routes to change
at the same time [1,3], and hence substantially increase the load in the router.
6 Conclusion
This paper shows that BGP route propagation is most sensitive to engineering and con-
nectivity of the networks it traverses. The propagation of BGP routing changes between
neighboring ASes can sometimes take more than 30 minutes. The longest propagation
times from Abilene to GEANT are due to route-ﬂap damping. From GEANT to Abi-
lene, the highest propagation times are caused by the load of the router where routes
are processed. GEANT has BGP sessions where it learns more than 150,000 preﬁxes
from a neighboring AS. A reset of any of these sessions would generate a prohibitively
large number of BGP updates that would in turn impact the router’s load. Note that any
AS that has a provider can experience a similar phenomenon, because ASes learn full
BGP tables in the session with their providers. The number of preﬁxes exchanged in
each BGP session and the number of BGP sessions per router are important factors that
impact router load.
