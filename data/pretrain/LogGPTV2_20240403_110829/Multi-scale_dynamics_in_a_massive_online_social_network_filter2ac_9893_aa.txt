## Abstract

Data confidentiality policies at major social network providers have significantly limited researchers' access to large-scale datasets. This has particularly impacted the study of network dynamics, where most research has focused on citation graphs and content-sharing networks, rather than the detailed dynamics of massive social networks.

In this paper, we present an analysis of detailed dynamics in a large Chinese social network over a 2-year period, during which the network grew from its first user to 19 million users and 199 million edges. Instead of validating a single model of network dynamics, we analyze dynamics at different granularities (per-user, per-community, and network-wide) to determine how much, if any, users are influenced by dynamics processes at different scales. We observe independent predictable processes at each level and find that the growth of communities has a moderate and sustained impact on users. In contrast, significant events such as network merge events have a strong but short-lived impact on users, quickly overshadowed by the continuous arrival of new users.

## 1. Introduction

A deeper understanding of the interrelated processes driving dynamics in social networks can help us better model and predict their structure and behavior. Improved models and predictors have numerous practical implications for the design of infrastructure, applications, and security mechanisms for social networks.

The best context for studying these dynamic processes is within today's massive Online Social Networks (OSNs), such as Facebook, LinkedIn, and Renren. However, the providers of large social networks generally consider their dynamic network data to be trade secrets and have few incentives to make such data available for research. As a result, studies have often focused on citation networks, content-sharing networks, and high-level statistics of social networks. Others have sought to validate generative models like preferential attachment (PA).

Our goal is to understand in detail the evolutionary dynamics in a social network, including both the initial growth process and the ongoing dynamics as the network matures. Much of the prior work in this area has focused on capturing network dynamics as a single process. In contrast, we are interested in how individual user dynamics are influenced by processes at different scales. Specifically, we explore how much the dynamics of users are influenced by external forces and events, such as the activities of friends in communities they belong to, or by large-scale events that occur at the network level.

In this work, we empirically explore these questions through a detailed analysis of social network dynamics at multiple scales: at the individual user level, at the level of user communities, and at the global network level. We study a dynamic graph, i.e., a sequence of detailed timestamped events that capture the ongoing growth of a large Chinese online social network. With over 220 million users, it is the largest social network in China, providing functionality similar to Facebook. Our analysis focuses on the first two years of its growth, from its first user in November 2005 to December 2007, when it had over 19 million members. This period captures the network's initial burst of growth and a period of more sustained growth and evolution. Our anonymized data includes timestamps of all events, including the creation of 19 million user accounts and 199 million edges. This dataset is notable for its scale, the absolute time associated with each event, and a rare network merge event, when the network merged with its largest competitor in December 2006, effectively doubling its size from 600K users to 1.3 million users in a single day.

## 2. Network-Level Analysis

We begin our study by describing the dataset and performing basic analysis to understand the impact of network dynamics on first-order graph metrics. Our data is an anonymized stream of timestamped events shared with us by a large Chinese social network, whose functionality is similar to those of Facebook, Google+, and Orkut.

### Dataset of Dynamics in a Massive Social Network

The first edge in our large social network was created on November 21, 2005. The social network was originally built as a communication tool for college students but expanded beyond schools in November 2007. Our anonymized dataset encompasses the timestamped creation events of all users and edges in the social network, covering more than 2 years, starting on November 21, 2005, and ending on December 31, 2007. The dataset includes the creation times of 19,413,375 nodes and 199,563,976 edges. To perform detailed analysis on the social graph, we produce 771 graphs representing daily static snapshots from the timestamped event stream. In this paper, we will use the term "node" to mean an OSN user and "edge" to mean a friendship link.

An unusual event happened on December 12, 2006, when our network merged with a second, competing online social network that was created in April 2006. On the merge date, our social network had 624K users with 8.2 million social links, and the second online social network had 670K users with 3 million social links. Wherever possible, we treat the merge as an external event to minimize its impact on our analysis of network growth. We also present a detailed analysis of the network merge event in Section 5.

On our network, default user policy limits each user to 1,000 friends. Users may pay a fee to increase their friend cap to 2,000. However, very few users take advantage of this feature, and the number of users with >1,000 friends is negligibly small.

### Network Growth

Figure 1(a) depicts the growth of the large Chinese social network in terms of the number of nodes and edges added each day. Day 0 is November 21, 2005. Overall, the network grows exponentially, which is expected for a social network. However, there are several real-world events that temporarily slow the growth, such as the Lunar New Year holiday, summer vacation, and the merge with the competing social network. These events manifest as visible artifacts in Figure 1(a). In Figure 1(b), we plot daily growth as a normalized ratio of network size from the previous day, showing that relative growth fluctuates wildly when the network is small but stabilizes as rapid growth keeps pace with network size.

### Graph Metrics Over Time

We now look at how four key graph metrics change over the lifetime of our dataset. [Insert Figures 1(c) and 1(d) here, along with detailed descriptions and interpretations of the metrics.]
