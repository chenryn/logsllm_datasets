ABSTRACT
social network
Data conﬁdentiality policies at major
providers have severely limited researchers’ access to large-
scale datasets. The biggest impact has been on the study of
network dynamics, where researchers have studied citation
graphs and content-sharing networks, but few have analyzed
detailed dynamics in the massive social networks that dom-
inate the web today.
In this paper, we present results of
analyzing detailed dynamics in a large Chinese social net-
work, covering a period of 2 years when the network grew
from its ﬁrst user to 19 million users and 199 million edges.
Rather than validate a single model of network dynamics,
we analyze dynamics at diﬀerent granularities (per-user, per-
community, and network-wide) to determine how much, if
any, users are inﬂuenced by dynamics processes at diﬀer-
ent scales. We observe independent predictable processes
at each level, and ﬁnd that the growth of communities has
moderate and sustained impact on users.
In contrast, we
ﬁnd that signiﬁcant events such as network merge events
have a strong but short-lived impact on users, and they are
quickly eclipsed by the continuous arrival of new users.

can allow us to better model and predict structure and dy-
namics in social networks.
In turn, improved models and
predictors have numerous practical implications on the de-
sign of infrastructure, applications, and security mechanisms
for social networks.
Details of these dynamic processes are best studied in the
context of today’s massive Online Social Networks (OSNs),
e.g. Facebook [38], LinkedIn [24], and Renren [13]. Un-
fortunately, the providers of large social networks generally
consider their dynamic network data to be trade secrets, and
have few incentives to make such data available for research.
Instead, studies have analyzed citation networks [22], con-
tent sharing networks [18], and high level statistics of social
networks [1]. Others [21, 26, 10] sought to validate genera-
tive models such as preferential attachment (PA) [5].
Our goal is to better understand in detail the evolution-
ary dynamics in a social network. This includes not only the
initial growth process during a social network’s formation,
but also the ongoing dynamics afterwards, as the network
matures. Much of the prior work in this area, including gen-
erative graph models and eﬀorts to validate them [5, 21, 26,
10], has focused on capturing network dynamics as a sin-
gle process. In contrast, we are interested in the question
“how are individual user dynamics inﬂuenced by processes
at diﬀerent scales?” How much are the dynamics of users in-
ﬂuenced by external forces and events, such as the activities
of friends in communities they belong to, or by large-scale
events that occur at the network level?
In this work, we explore these questions empirically
through a detailed analysis of social network dynamics at
multiple scales: at the individual user level, at the level of
user communities, and at the global network level. We study
a dynamic graph, i.e. a sequence of detailed timestamped
events that capture the ongoing growth of a large Chinese
online social network. With over 220 million users, it is
the largest social network in China, and provides function-
ality similar to Facebook. We focus our analysis on ﬁrst two
years of its growth, from its ﬁrst user in November 2005,
to December 2007 when it had over 19 million members.
This captures the network’s initial burst of growth, as well
as a period of more sustained growth and evolution. Our
anonymized data includes timestamps of all events, includ-
ing the creation of 19 million user accounts and 199 million
edges. This dataset is notable because of three features: its
scale, the absolute time associated with each event, and a
rare network merge event, when the network merged with its
largest competitor in December 2006, eﬀectively doubling its
size from 600K users to 1.3 million users in a single day.
171Our analysis of network dynamics in this dataset focuses
on three diﬀerent levels of granularity: nodes, communi-
ties, and networks. At each level, we search for evidence of
impact on user behavior. Along the way, we also make a
number of intriguing observations about dynamic processes
in network communities and network-wide events.
Individual Nodes. The creation of links between individ-
ual users has been studied in a number of contexts, and is
long believed to be driven by generative models based on
the principle of preferential attachment, i.e. users prefer
to connect to nodes with higher degree [5]. Our goal is to
extend the analysis of this model with respect to two new
dimensions. First, preferential attachment deﬁnes how a se-
quence of edges are created in logical order, but how do node
dynamics correlate with absolute time? Second, does the
strength of the preferential attachment model strengthen or
weaken as the network grows in scale and matures?
Communities. Intuitively, the behavior of a user is likely
to be signiﬁcantly impacted by the actions of her friends in
the network. This has been previously observed in oﬄine
social networks [39]. Our goal is to empirically determine if
user activity at the level of communities has a real impact on
individual users. To do so, we ﬁrst implement a way to deﬁne
and track the evolution of user communities over time. We
use the Louvain algorithm [6] to detect communities, track
the emergence and dissolution of communities over time, and
quantify the correlation of user behavior to the lifetime, size,
and activity level of the communities they belong to.
Networks. Finally, we wish to quantify the impact, if
any, of network-level events on individual user behavior. By
network-level events, we refer to unusual events that aﬀect
the entire network, such as the merging of two distinct so-
cial networks recorded in our dataset. We analyze user data
before and after the merge of our social network and its
competitor, and quantify the impact of diﬀerent factors on
user behavior, including duplicate accounts, and user’s edge
creation preferences over time.
Key Findings.
Our analysis produces several signif-
icant ﬁndings. First, we ﬁnd that nodes (users) are most
active in building links (friendships) shortly after joining the
network. As the network matures, however, we ﬁnd that new
edge creation is increasingly dominated by existing nodes in
the system, even though new node arrivals is keeping pace
with network growth. Second, we ﬁnd that inﬂuence of the
preferential attachment model weakens over time, perhaps
reﬂecting the reduced visibility of each node over time. As
the network grows in size, users are less likely to be aware of
high degree nodes in the network, and more likely to obey
the preferential model with users within a limited neighbor-
hood. Third, at the level of user communities, we ﬁnd using
the Louvain algorithm that users in large communities are
more active in creating friends and stay active for a longer
time. In addition, we found that a combination of commu-
nity structural features can predict the short-term “death”
of a community with more than 75% accuracy.
Finally, in our analysis of the network merge event, we use
user activity to identify duplicate accounts across the net-
works. Aside from duplicate accounts, we ﬁnd that the net-
work merge event has a distinct short-term impact on user
activity patterns. Users generate a high burst in edge cre-
ation, but the cross-network activity fades and quickly be-
comes dominated by edge creation generated by new users.
Overall, this quickly reduces average distance between the
two networks and melds them into a single monolithic net-
work.
2. NETWORK LEVEL ANALYSIS
We begin our study by ﬁrst describing the dataset, and
performing some basic analysis to understand the impact of
network dynamics on ﬁrst order graph metrics. Our data is
an anonymized stream of timestamped events shared with
us by a large Chinese social network, whose functionality
is similar to those of Facebook, Google+ and Orkut. Our
basic measurements in this section set the context for the
analysis of more detailed metrics in later sections.
Dataset of Dynamics in a Massive Social Network.
The ﬁrst edge in our large social network was created on
November 21, 2005. The social network was originally built
as a communication tool for college students, but expanded
beyond schools in November 2007.
Our anonymized dataset encompasses the timestamped
creation events of all users and edges in the social network.
The dataset covers more than 2 years, starting on Novem-
ber 21, 2005 and ending December 31, 2007.
In all, the
dataset includes the creation times of 19,413,375 nodes and
199,563,976 edges. To perform detailed analysis on the so-
cial graph, we produce 771 graphs representing daily static
snapshots from the timestamped event stream. Note that in
this paper, we will use the term node to mean an OSN user
and edge to mean a friendship link.
An unusual event happened on December 12, 2006, when
our network merged with a second, competing online social
network that was created in April 2006. On the merge date,
our social network had 624K users with 8.2 million social
links, and the second online social network had 670K users
with 3 million social links. Wherever possible, we treat the
merge as an external event to minimize its impact on our
analysis of network growth. We also present detailed analy-
sis of the network merge event in Section 5.
On our network, default user policy limits each user to
1,000 friends. Users may pay a fee in order to increase their
friend cap to 2,000. However, prior work by the network
has shown that very few users take advantage of such fea-
tures. We make the same observation about our dataset:
the number of users with >1,000 friends is negligibly small.
Network Growth.
Figure 1(a) depicts the growth of
the large Chinese social network in terms of the number of
nodes and edges added each day. Day 0 is November 21,
2005. Overall, the network grows exponentially, which is
expected for a social network. However, there are a num-
ber of real world events that temporarily slow the growth,
and manifest as visible artifacts in Figure 1(a). The two
week period starting at day 56 represents the Lunar New
Year holiday; a two-month period starting on day 222 ac-
counts for summer vacation; the merge with the competing
social network causes a jump in nodes and edges on day
386; additional dips for the lunar new year and summer
break are visible starting at days 432 and 587, respectively.
In Figure 1(b), we plot daily growth as a normalized ratio
of network size from the previous day. It shows that rela-
tive growth ﬂuctuates wildly when the network is small, but
stabilizes as rapid growth begins to keep rough pace with
network size.
Graph Metrics Over Time.
We now look at how
four key graph metrics change over the lifetime of our data
