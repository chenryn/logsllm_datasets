I would like to determine if Twisted imposes any restrictions on the maximum size of UDP packets. On Linux platforms, the allowable limit is up to 64 KB. However, I am unable to send packets larger than approximately 2500 bytes, even though I intend to send packets of around 10 KB containing JPEG images.

Are you certain that the issue is not related to the receiving end? Additionally, it's possible that the packets are being fragmented during transmission, which could affect their delivery.
