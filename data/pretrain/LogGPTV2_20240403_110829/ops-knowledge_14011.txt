User: I would like to find out if Twisted imposes restriction on maximum size of UDP packets. The allowable limit on linux platforms is upto 64k (although I intend to send packets of about 10k bytes consisting of JPEG images) but I am not able to send more than approx. 2500 bytes
Assistant: Are you sure that it is not a receive problem?
There is no indication that your packets won't be fragmented en route to the destination
