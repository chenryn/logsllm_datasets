### Issue Overview

The `twisted.internet.base.ThreadedResolver` (version 18.9.1.dev0) currently uses `socket.gethostbyname` for DNS resolution, which does not support IPv6. Scrapy (version 1.5.0) relies on `ThreadedResolver` for DNS resolution, resulting in the inability to crawl hosts with only IPv6 addresses or pure IPv6 IP addresses.

### Example of the Issue

To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:

1. **Set up a virtual environment:**
   ```sh
   if [ ! -d testvenv ]; then
       virtualenv -p python testvenv
   fi
   . testvenv/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Install Scrapy:**
   ```sh
   pip install -q scrapy  # or install twisted and scrapy from source repository
   ```

3. **Attempt to use Scrapy with an IPv6 address:**
   ```sh
   python -m scrapy shell http://ipv6.google.com
   # This will raise:
   # twisted.internet.error.DNSLookupError: DNS lookup failed: no results for hostname lookup: ipv6.google.com.
   
   python -m scrapy shell http://[::1]  # No need for an existing web server at [::1]:80
   # This will raise:
   # twisted.internet.error.DNSLookupError: DNS lookup failed: no results for hostname lookup: ::1.
   ```

### Solution

Recent versions of Twisted include a default resolver that supports IPv6. To resolve the issue, you can disable the custom resolver used by Scrapy. Specifically, remove the following line from `scrapy/crawler.py` (line 289):

```python
reactor.installResolver(self._get_dns_resolver())
```

After making this change, the following commands should work without raising a `DNSLookupError`:

```sh
python -m scrapy shell http://ipv6.google.com
python -m scrapy shell http://[::1]
```

### Considerations

- **Caching:** Although `CachingThreadedResolver` is used to cache DNS queries, the compatibility with IPv6 is more important. If in-process DNS caching is still required, it could be reimplemented using middleware.
- **User Option:** An option could be provided to explicitly enable IPv6 support, especially when `DNSCACHE_ENABLED = False`.
- **Timeout Configuration:** There are other ways to set DNS query timeouts in Twisted, but I am not familiar with the specifics.

### Attempted Fix

I attempted to create a pull request (PR) for Twisted to modify `ThreadedResolver.getHostByName` to use `getaddrinfo` for IPv6 support. However, after discussing with `cdunklau` in the `#twisted-dev` IRC channel, it was determined that this change would be backward-incompatible and unlikely to be accepted. The best solution is to use the new default IPv6-compatible resolver in Twisted.

### Conclusion

To fully support IPv6, update the Twisted version to one that includes the new default resolver. This will ensure that Scrapy can handle both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses without issues.
