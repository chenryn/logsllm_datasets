Subject: Inquiry Regarding Recent Changes to Code Execution Process and Issue with a Specific Challenge

Hi,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to inquire about a recent change in the process for running code and progressing through challenges on the platform.

Previously, after pressing "Run Code 1x," I would receive positive feedback and automatically advance to the next challenge. However, now it appears that I must press "Run Code 1x" again after receiving the positive feedback to move on to the next challenge. Could you please confirm if this change was intentional?

Additionally, I have encountered an issue with the following challenge:
- **Challenge:** [Add Different Margins to Each Side of an Element](http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/waypoint-add-different-margins-to-each-side-of-an-element)

To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:
1. Navigate to the challenge link provided.
2. Attempt to complete the challenge as per the instructions.
3. [Provide specific details on what happens when you try to complete the challenge, e.g., error messages, unexpected behavior, etc.]

If possible, please include any relevant screenshots or additional details that may help in diagnosing the problem.

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,
Victoria
