Hi,
Prior to the changes I was able to press the Run Code 1x and received my
positive feedback and move to the next challenge. Now I have to press it after
I receive my postive feedback to go to the next challenge. Was this
intentionally done?
Challenge http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/waypoint-add-different-
margins-to-each-side-of-an-element has an issue. Please describe how to
reproduce it, and include links to screenshots if possible.
