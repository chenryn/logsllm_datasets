### Handling Full Queue and Administration Structures

**Queue Structure Full:**
- If a queue structure reaches its capacity, the application will receive the return code `MQRC_STORAGE_MEDIUM_FULL`.

**Administration Structure Full:**
- The symptoms of an administration structure becoming full vary depending on which processes encounter the error. These can range from no responses to `CMDSCOPE(GROUP)` commands to queue manager failure due to issues during commit processing.

**System Programmer Actions:**
- **Inhibit MQPUT Operations:** Use IBM MQ to prevent applications from writing more messages to some queues.
- **Start More Applications:** Initiate additional applications to process messages from the queues.
- **Quiesce Some Applications:** Temporarily stop some applications that are adding messages to the queue.
- **Alter Structure Size:** Use XES facilities to modify the structure size in place. For z/OS, use the following command:
  ```shell
  SETXCF START,ALTER,STRNAME=structure-name,SIZE=newsize
  ```
  - `newsize` must be less than the `MAXSIZE` specified in the CFRM policy but greater than the current coupling facility size.
- **Monitor Utilization:** Use the `DISPLAY CFSTATUS` command to monitor the utilization of a coupling facility structure.

### Db2 Subsystem Failure

**Db2 Subsystem Failure:**
- If a Db2 subsystem connected to IBM MQ fails, IBM MQ attempts to reconnect to the subsystem and continue operations.
- If a Db2 group attach name is specified in the `QSGDATA` parameter of the `CSQ6SYSP` system parameter module, IBM MQ will reconnect to another active Db2 within the same data-sharing group, if available on the same z/OS image.

**Operations Affected:**
- The following operations do not work while IBM MQ is not connected to Db2:
  - Deleting or altering shared queue or group object definitions.
  - Defining new shared queues or group objects.
  - Displaying shared queues or group objects.
  - Starting, stopping, or other actions for shared channels.
  - Reading the shared queue definition from Db2 for the first time using `MQOPEN`.

**Continuing Operations:**
- Other IBM MQ API operations continue normally for shared queues.
- All IBM MQ operations can be performed against the queue manager's private versions (COPY objects) built from GROUP objects.
- Shared channels continue to run normally until they end or encounter an error, at which point they enter a retry state.

**Resynchronization:**
- When IBM MQ reconnects to Db2, resynchronization occurs between the queue manager and Db2.
- This involves updating the queue manager with new objects defined in Db2 and updating object attributes of shared queues that have changed.
- Any shared channels in a retry state are recovered.

**Locks and Recovery:**
- If a Db2 subsystem fails, it may hold locks on Db2 resources. Restart the failed Db2 to release these locks and make the resources available again.

### Db2 Data-Sharing Group Failure

**Data-Sharing Group Failure:**
- If an entire Db2 data-sharing group fails, recovery can be to the point of failure or to a previous point in time.
- In the case of recovery to the point of failure, IBM MQ reconnects, and normal queue manager function resumes after resynchronization.
- If Db2 is recovered to a previous point in time, inconsistencies may arise between the actual queues in the coupling facility structures and the Db2 view of those queues.

**Recovery Procedure:**
1. Prevent IBM MQ from reconnecting to Db2 by starting Db2 in utility mode or altering security profiles.
2. Offload important messages from shared queues using the `COPY` function of the `CSQUTIL` utility program.
3. Terminate all queue managers.
4. Clear all structures using the `SETXCF FORCE,STRUCTURE,STRNAME=` command.
5. Restore Db2 to a historical point in time.
6. Reestablish queue manager access to Db2.
7. Restart the queue managers.
8. Recover IBM MQ definitions from backup copies.
9. Reload any offloaded messages to the shared queues.

### Coupling Facility Failure

**Coupling Facility Failure:**
- If the coupling facility fails, the queue manager may fail, and Db2 will also fail if it is using this coupling facility.
- Recover Db2 using Db2 recovery procedures and restart the queue managers.
- The CF administration structure is rebuilt by restarting all queue managers within the queue sharing group.

**Application Structure Failure:**
- **CFLEVEL(3) or Higher, RECOVER=YES:** The structure is unusable until recovered using the `MQSC RECOVER CFSTRUCT` command. The queue manager performing the recovery replays backups in the correct sequence.
- **CFLEVEL(3) or Higher, RECOVER=NO:** The structure is automatically reallocated, and all messages are lost.
- **CFLEVEL < 3:** The queue manager fails. On restart, peer recovery reallocates a new version of the structure, and all messages on shared queues are lost.

**Tolerating Connectivity Loss:**
- Since IBM WebSphere MQ 7.1, queue managers in queue sharing groups can tolerate loss of connectivity to coupling facility structures without failing. The structure is rebuilt in another coupling facility to regain access to shared queues.

### Long-Running Units of Work

**Problem:**
- A long-running unit of work (UOW) detected during restart, where the origin RBA predates the oldest active log.

**Symptoms:**
- IBM MQ issues the message: `CSQR020I +CSQ1 OLD UOW FOUND`.

**Operator Action:**
- Decide whether to commit the UOW. If not committed, it is handled by normal restart recovery, which may involve reading archive logs.

### IMS-Related Problems

**IMS Cannot Connect to IBM MQ:**
- **Symptoms:** IMS adapter issues messages `CSQQ001I`, `CSQQ002E`, `CSQQ003E`, `CSQQ004E`, `CSQQ005E`, `CSQQ007E`.
- **Action:** Analyze and correct the problem, then restart the connection with the `/START SUBSYS subsysname` command.

**IMS Application Problem:**
- **Symptoms:** IMS application terminates abnormally, sending message `DFS555I TRANSACTION tran-id ABEND abcode`.
- **Action:** Follow instructions in message `DFS554A` on the IMS master terminal.

**IMS Not Operational:**
- **Symptoms:** IMS waits, loops, or terminates abnormally.
- **Action:** Resolve the problem, then perform an emergency restart of IMS.

### Hardware Problems

**Data Recovery:**
- If a hardware error causes data to be unreadable, use the media recovery technique:
  1. Obtain a backup copy of the data using DFDSS or Access Method Services REPRO.
  2. Reinstate the most recent backup copy.
  3. Restart the queue manager.
- Ensure sufficient archive logs are kept to reinstate changes fully.
