## Abstract
Mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) are crucial for connecting devices in pervasive environments, offering cost-effective and flexible communication. However, they face significant security challenges. Various secure routing and intrusion detection schemes have been proposed, but most have only been validated through simulations. This paper presents a proof-of-concept implementation of a threshold-based intrusion detection system (IDS) and a secure version of the AODV routing protocol (SecAODV) on handheld devices. The IDS detects attacks on data traffic, while SecAODV incorporates non-repudiation and authentication features without relying on a Certificate Authority (CA) or Key Distribution Center (KDC). We detail the design, implementation, and practical considerations, demonstrating how these mechanisms can detect and mitigate malicious attacks.

## 1. Introduction
Advances in hardware for miniature devices such as PDAs, mobile phones, and converged devices have significantly enhanced their computational, storage, and communication capabilities. Parallel developments in both infrastructure-based and ad hoc mobile networks enable these devices to interconnect spontaneously with other nearby devices. These advancements have led to efforts to provide services via client-server models over infrastructure-based networks and peer-to-peer services over ad hoc networks. Ad hoc networks are particularly useful in scenarios where infrastructure is non-existent, damaged, or compromised, such as in disaster-affected areas or battlefields.

In such dynamic and open environments, identification and authentication are challenging. Devices can easily assume fake identities and spoof IP addresses. While cryptographic protocols can add a layer of security, determining trusted devices is difficult due to the lack of available authentication services. Even with pre-distributed security credentials, a device can be captured or compromised, posing a threat to the network.

This paper presents a two-pronged approach to protect MANETs: securing the routing process and deploying IDSs on individual nodes. This combination of a watchdog-based IDS and a decentralized cryptographic generation of IPv6 addresses for unique and non-repudiable identities is a novel approach. Our main contribution is the actual implementation of an IDS and SecAODV, deployed and tested on Linux-based mobile handheld devices (iPAQs connected via 802.11 in ad hoc mode).

## 2. Background

### 2.1. Collaborative Routing Mechanisms
MANETs consist of mobile devices communicating wirelessly, with a continuously changing topology. On-demand or reactive routing protocols, which do not maintain prior network topology information, are commonly used. These protocols, such as DSR, TORA, AODV, and SSA, rely on neighboring nodes to discover each other and establish routes. However, they assume non-hostile environments, which is often not the case in real-world scenarios. We describe the first implementation of a secure routing protocol based on AODV, called SecAODV, which uses IPv6.

### 2.2. MANET Vulnerabilities and Possible Attacks
MANETs are inherently vulnerable to various attacks due to the open medium of communication, resource-constrained devices, and the collaborative nature of the routing process. Common attacks include routing disruption and resource consumption. Resource consumption attacks target the MAC and PHY layers, consuming bandwidth and energy. We focus on attacks specific to the networking and application layers, such as those targeting the routing process and data traffic.

### 2.3. Identities and Key Management
In pervasive computing environments, devices must communicate with peers in their vicinity without centralized control or pre-known identities. Conventional client-server methods of identification and authentication are not feasible. PGP's web-of-trust model, while distributed, still relies on connectivity to keying servers, which may not be possible in ad hoc networks. Unique and reliable credentials and authentication mechanisms are essential for securing MANETs.

### 2.4. Intrusion Detection Challenges
Encryption and signed headers are insufficient for complete security. An IDS is necessary to strengthen the defense. In MANETs, differentiating between malicious and typical network activity is challenging. Malicious nodes may enter and leave the network intermittently, complicating detection. Unlike wired networks, MANETs lack centralized management, making it difficult to perform network-wide monitoring and forensics.

## 3. Related Work
Several intrusion detection schemes and secure routing protocols have been proposed for MANETs, but their validation has been limited to simulations. Our work extends these efforts by providing an actual implementation and deployment on real devices.

## 4. SecAODV Protocol
We extend the AODV protocol to include security features that prevent prevalent attacks. SecAODV uses decentralized cryptographic generation of IPv6 addresses for unique and non-repudiable identities. This ensures that nodes can be authenticated and trusted without relying on a CA or KDC.

## 5. Threshold-based Detection Approach
Our IDS employs a threshold-based anomaly detection scheme to monitor data traffic and detect malicious or faulty nodes. Anomaly detection and routing state monitoring are used to provide secure routing and detect attacks on data traffic. We propose a distributed IDS architecture for MANETs to help detect and prevent attacks.

## 6. Prototype Performance Analysis
We present performance analysis results from our prototype implementation, which demonstrates the viability of our two-pronged approach. The source code for the MANET IDS and SecAODV is publicly available under the UMBC Gnu Public License.

## 7. Snooping-based IDS and Simulation Results
We describe the concept of our snooping-based IDS and present simulation results. These results provide insights into the practical considerations involved in deploying these mechanisms on resource-constrained devices.

## 8. Conclusion
We conclude with lessons learned and ideas for future work, emphasizing the importance of combining secure routing and intrusion detection to protect MANETs effectively.
