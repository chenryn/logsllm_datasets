When I run this code:
    N, C = 1, 1
    criterion = nn.NLLLoss()
    model = nn.Conv2d(C, 3, (3, 3)).cuda()
    inp = Variable(torch.randn(N, 1, 3, 3)).cuda()
    pred = model(inp)
    target = Variable(torch.from_numpy(np.array([3]))).view(1, 1, 1).cuda()
    criterion(pred, target)
I get this error:
    cuda runtime error (59) : device-side assert triggered at /opt/conda/conda-bld/pytorch_1518244421288/work/torch/lib/THC/generic/THCTensorCopy.c:70
Due to the value of `target` being `3`, and not in the set of `{0, 1, 2}`. It
took me a while to figure out and I was wondering this is an easy to fix
issue, and if it is I was wondering how I would get started as I'm quite eager
to contribute to Pytorch
