### Summary of Log Chunk

This log chunk, spanning from 18:07:52 to 18:07:57 on October 18, documents a series of connection and lease renewal issues in a Hadoop environment. Here is a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Connection Attempts to Resource Manager (RM):**
   - The `RMCommunicator Allocator` attempts to connect to the server `msra-sa-41:8030`.
   - The retry policy is set to `RetryUpToMaximumCountWithFixedSleep` with a maximum of 10 retries and a sleep time of 1 second between each attempt.
   - Each connection attempt fails, resulting in an `ERROR IN CONTACTING RM` message.

2. **Lease Renewal Failures:**
   - The `LeaseRenewer` component is trying to renew the lease for `DFSClient_NONMAPREDUCE_1537864556_1`.
   - The lease renewal fails, and the system indicates that it will retry shortly. The failure duration increases by one second in each subsequent log entry (from 175 seconds to 179 seconds).

3. **Address Changes:**
   - Both the `RMCommunicator Allocator` and the `LeaseRenewer` detect address changes:
     - For the `RMCommunicator Allocator`, the address changes from `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:8030` to `msra-sa-41:8030`.
     - For the `LeaseRenewer`, the address changes from `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:9000` to `msra-sa-41:9000`.

### Key Observations
- **Connection Issues:** The `RMCommunicator Allocator` is unable to establish a connection to the Resource Manager, indicating potential network or server availability issues.
- **Lease Renewal Delays:** The `LeaseRenewer` is experiencing delays in renewing the lease, which could lead to data corruption or loss if not resolved.
- **Address Changes:** The detected address changes suggest that the system is dynamically updating its configuration, possibly due to network reconfiguration or DNS updates.

### Recommendations
- **Investigate Network and Server Availability:** Check the network connectivity and the status of the Resource Manager server at `msra-sa-41:8030`.
- **Monitor Lease Renewal Attempts:** Ensure that the `LeaseRenewer` successfully renews the lease to prevent data integrity issues.
- **Verify Configuration Changes:** Confirm that the address changes are expected and part of a planned update. If not, investigate the cause of these changes.

By addressing these issues, the system can be stabilized, and the risk of data loss or corruption can be mitigated.
