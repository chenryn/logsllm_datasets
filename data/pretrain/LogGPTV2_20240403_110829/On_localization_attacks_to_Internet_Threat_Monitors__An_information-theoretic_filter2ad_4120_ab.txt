Here the background traffic is due to traffic reports from
monitors covering other networks. After getting the report
data, the attacker tries to detect the embedded signal in the
report data.
In [14], we describe a steganographic localization at(cid:173)
that
is designed to remain undetectable. Specifi(cid:173)
tack,
the attacker launches a low-rate noise-like port(cid:173)
cally,
scan probing traffic modulated by a secret mark based
on PN-code. Generally, a PN-code is a sequence of -1
or +1 with the following features [18]: (i) The PN-code
is random and "balanced". That is, the -1 and +1 are
randomly distributed and the occurrence frequencies of
-1 and +1 are nearly equal. It makes the modulated
probing traffic appear as noise and has it blend in with
background traffic in both the time and frequency domains.
(ii) The PN-code is highly correlated to itself and is poorly
correlated to others; such as random noise. This feature
enables the attacker to accurately recognize attack traffic
(encoded by the PN-code) from the traffic report data in
the presence of interference due to high-rate background
traffic. As a result,
the probing traffic rate can be very
small in comparison with noise, so that the probing traffic
is indistinguishable from background traffic.
III. Information-Theoretic Framework
In this section, we propose an information-theoretic
framework to formalize the localization attack as informa(cid:173)
tion disclosure through a communication channel. We first
present the information-theoretic framework and then map

the channel capacity to the minimum time length required
for localization attacks. Finally, based on insights from the
channel model, we introduce possible strategies (including
both existing strategies and those developed in this paper)
for both the attacker and defender.

A. Model
As shown in Fig. 1, an attacker launches probing attack
traffic to a target network. In order to accurately identify
the presence of a monitor in the target network, the probing
attack traffic is modulated by a special signal encoded by
a secret code only known to the attacker. Using the secret
code, the attacker then "decode" the reports published by
the data center to distinguish the embedded signal from the
background noise (introduced by traffic reports from other
networks). This creates a side communication channel for
the attacker to discover the location of monitors from the
published reports. We can model this side channel based
on Shannon's information theory [19]. In this model, the
attacker (as a transmitter) generates and sends the attack
signal over a noisy side channel and the same attacker (as
a receiver) recognizes the signal transmitted over the side
channel.
Fig. 2 shows this side channel model. A source message
x is first encoded into a sequence of signals, as done in
Attack Stage 1 in Fig. 1. The output t x of the encoder is
then transmitted through the noised channel with additive
noisy w, which is introduced by data collected by other
monitors. From the channel output T x = t x + w,
the
attacker (as a receiver) attempts to recover the transmitted
message x by decoding T x
to y. If y ~ x, the attacker
successfully recognizes the source message x. This refers
to the Attack Stage 2 shown in Fig. 1. As a result,
the attacker successfully determines whether the target
network contains monitors or not. We use the localization
attack discussed in Section II-B as an example to illustrate
the model.
First, at the transmitter, the attacker generates the source
message x = 1 for a given network M j . After the
encoding procedure, the attacker selects an n-bit PN-code
(n ~ 1) and generates a port-scan probing traffic
Ct
t x = fE(x, Ct, p/) = p/XCt = p/Ct to network M j , where
fE ( .) and JL' are the encoding function and the amplitude of
probing traffic, respectively. If the target network contains
a monitor, then t x will be logged and transmitted to the
data center along with any noise w. We assume that the
mean and variance of W is JL and (J2, respectively. At the
receiver side, the attacker receives T x = t x + w, and aims
to decode and derive x based on the synchronized PN-code
Ct· In particular, if Tx . Ct = JL' Ct . Ct + W . Ct ~ t R, where
tR is the decoding threshold, then x = 1 and the attacker
is assured that the network M j
is deployed with monitors.
Otherwise, x = 0 and the network M j
is not deployed

B. Capacity of Channel and Minimum
Time Length
To evaluate the effectiveness of location attacks, we
introduce the concept of channel capacity [19] which is
a theoretical upper-bound on the number of bits that can
be reliably transmitted over a noisy channel in a time slot
[19]. Theory of channel capacity has been the foundation
for communication system design [20], which aims to
achieve such a theoretical bound by various channel coding
mechanisms.
In the model described in Fig. 2, we denote the at(cid:173)
tack signal t x = (t x 1 , t x 2, . . . ,txn ) as the transmitted
signal over the channel. To measure the amplitude of the
transmitted signal, we define its transmission power as
2 = ~ l:~=1 t xi
. For the sake of simplicity, we assume
8
that noise W = (WI, W2,·· . ,wn ) (n ~ 1) has mean of 0
and variance (J2. Assume that both the signal and noise
are Gaussian white noise (WGN) processes 1; the channel
is called a Gaussian channel and its capacity is

Since the capacity C measures the degree of successful sig(cid:173)
nal transmission over the channel, a higher capacity reflects
a more effective localization attack. From Equation (1), we
know that for a given noise variance (J2, an increase of the
transmission power 8 2 results in a higher capacity of the
channel for the transmission of the attack signal.

Recall
the capacity C measures the theoretical
upper-bound for the signal transmission over the channel.
Given any transmission error rate f > 0, for any large n(cid:173)

of l(~ n) for nil:::; c, there exists no encoding/decoding

the traffic distribution
of Internet port-scans is still an open problem and requires careful
investigation. Therefore, we used Gaussian white-noise as an example
in our theoretical analysis to provide insights into the effectiveness of
localization attacks and countermeasures. Additionally, our simulation
data based on real-world traces validates our theoretical findings.

it is also possible to find such a scheme with arbitrarily
small error.
In the localization attack, we assume that
the time
for transmitting a I-bit attack signal is denoted as chip
duration tc . The minimum code length for reliably trans(cid:173)

minimum time length for the n-bit signal transmission is
1 = ntc .

This is the minimum time length needed for the attacker to
detect whether a particular network M j is being monitored
or not.
c. Strategies
Based on the channel model described above, we in(cid:173)
troduce the possible strategies for both the attacker and
the defender. Note that some strategies we discuss here
are existing ones and others are newly developed in this
paper.
1) Attacker Strategies:
In the threat model described
in Section II-B, the attacker intends to accurately locate
monitors without being detected. In particular, the attacker
does so by launching probing traffic embedded with a
specific attack signal (or mark). Note that
the attacker
needs to maintain a high capacity c because if the channel
capacity c is low, the prolonged time length required by
the localization attack may become meaningless for the
attackers to launch localization attacks. Based on the model
described in Section III-B, we know that
the attacker
should use a low transmission power 8 2 for the secrecy
of attack. Nonetheless, as we can see from equation (1),
the lower transmission power 8 2 will always lead to a
lower channel capacity and longer time length needed
for the localization attack. In order to address this, we
propose attacking strategies for the attacker to distribute
the transmission power of attack signal over temporal
and/or spatial domains.
In particular, we consider the
following two schemes:
• Temporal Attack. In this scheme, the attacker targets
a single network (i.e., one monitor) at one time. As
such, the signal power in each time window of signal
is comparatively low, which preserves the secrecy
of the attack. Nonetheless, the total signal power in
the duration of attack is still reasonably high. Thus,
attack accuracy can also be achieved. The PN-code(cid:173)
based approach in [14] is an example of this scheme.
It generates a multiple-bit attack signal for a single
monitor. In addition, the schemes proposed in [12],
[13], which use an I-bit attack signal
to a single
monitor, are other special cases of a temporal attack.
From the perspective of channel coding theory, this
attack forms a Single-Input Single- Output (SISO)
communication channel, because attack traffic is senl
to each individual monitor sequentially.
• Spatial Attack. In this scheme, the attacker launches
coordinated attacks on multiple monitors. By doing
so, the power transmitted from each single monitor
can be significantly reduced to preserve attack se(cid:173)
crecy, while the total power from multiple coordinated
monitors can be high enough to achieve high attack
accuracy. This scheme is motivated by the signal
transmission schem~ through multiple antennas in
wireless communication system [21], which has been
proved to improve the signal transmission reliability
and reduce interference from noise. From the per(cid:173)
spective of channel coding theory, this attack forms a
Multiple-Input Single-Output (MISO) channel, since
the attack launches attack traffic on multiple monitors
simultaneously, but receives reports only from the
data center.
2) Defender: Based on the
information-theoretic
framework described in Section III-B, the defender needs
localization attacks by reducing the
to defend against
channel capacity to a necessarily low level. By doing so,
the attacker will be forced to launch an attack which lasts
for a fairly large amount of time to achieve a meaningful
detection rate. This significantly degrades the effectiveness
of localization attacks. According to equation (1), there
are two ways to achieve this objective. One is to reduce
the transmission power 8 2 of the attack signal. The other
is to increase the power of noise (J2. Notice that adding
noise will jeopardize the accuracy of data reported by ITM
systems and reduce the usability of ITM systems. How
to balance the trade-off between monitor location privacy
and the usability of ITM systems is one critical issue that
we will study in future work. In this paper, we focus on
investigating detection schemes based on the first strategy,
that is, by reducing the transmission power 8 2 of the attack.
We consider the following three schemes for the defender:
• Centralized Detection. In this scheme, the defender
will perform anomaly detection on the traffic informa(cid:173)
tion aggregated from all monitors in the ITM system.
If the overall traffic rate (e.g., volume in a given time
interval) is larger than a pre-determined threshold,
the defender will issue an alarm. This scheme has
been extensively used in many existing ITM systems
to defend against worms and DDoS attacks [4]. In
Section IV, we will show that this detection scheme
is effective against the temporal attack with a I-bit
attack signal [12], [13].
• Distributed Detection. In this scheme, the defender
will perform anomaly detection on the traffic infor(cid:173)
mation collected by each monitor individually in a
fully distributed manner. That is, each monitor will
be responsible for detecting the anomaly based on

the statIstIcs of a local traffic profile. If the traffic
rate (e.g., volume for a given time duration) is larger
than a pre-determined threshold, an alarm is issued.
We will show that this detection scheme is effective
against the temporal attack in Section IV.
• Hybrid Detection. In this scheme, the defender will
perform anomaly detection on the correlation between
traffic logs from multiple monitors. We will introduce
the basic principle of this detection scheme and show
that
this detection scheme is effective against the
spatial attack in Section V.
In the following sections, based on the information(cid:173)
theoretic framework, we will derive closed formulae to an(cid:173)

strategies. We will show our results for temporal attacks
