**ATT&CK ID:** T1639  
**Technique Name:** Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol

**Description:**
Adversaries may exfiltrate data using a different protocol than the one used for the command and control (C2) channel. This technique involves transmitting the stolen data to an alternate network location, which may differ from the primary C2 server. By leveraging alternative protocols, adversaries can evade detection and complicate the monitoring of data exfiltration activities.
