User: In order to start Google app engine through the cmd i use: dev_appserver.py --port=8080, but i can't figure how does it pick a file to run from the current directory.
My question is, is there an argument specifying a file to run in the server from all possible files in the directory?
Assistant: dev_appserver doesn't "run a file" at all. It launches the GAE dev environment, and routes requests using the paths defined in app.yaml just like the production version.
If you need to route your requests to a specific Python file, you should define that in app.yaml.
