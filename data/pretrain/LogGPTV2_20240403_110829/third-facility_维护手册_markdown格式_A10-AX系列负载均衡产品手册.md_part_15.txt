        [thales-kmdata file [overwrite]]
        [thales-secworld file [overwrite]]
        [wsdl file]
        [xml-schema file]
    }
    [use-mgmt-port] url
    period seconds
}
```

### Parameters

- **aflex**: Imports an aFleX file.
- **auth-portal**: Imports an authentication portal file for Application Access Management (AAM).
- **bw-list**: Imports a black/white list.
- **class-list-convert**: Converts a newline-delimited text file to a class-list file of the specified type. The supported types are:
  - `ac`: Aho-Corasick class list.
  - `string`
  - `ipv4`
  - `ipv6`
  - `string-case-insensitive`
  - Note: Only the Aho-Corasick class list is compatible with the class list types created through the `class-list` command.
- **dnssec-dnskey**: Imports a DNSSEC key-signing key (KSK) file.
- **dnssec-ds**: Imports a DNSSEC DS file.
- **geo-location**: Imports a geo-location data file for Global Server Load Balancing (GSLB).
- **license**: Imports a license file, if applicable to your model.
- **local-uri-file**: Imports a local URI file.
- **policy**: Imports a WAF policy file.
- **ssl-cert [bulk]**: Imports a certificate. Use the `bulk` option to import multiple files simultaneously as a `.tgz` archive. You can specify the `certificate-type` and use `csr-generate` to generate a CSR file.
- **ssl-cert-key [bulk]**: Imports a certificate and key together as a single file. Use `bulk` to import multiple files simultaneously as a `.tgg` archive.
- **ssl-key [bulk]**: Imports a certificate key. Use `bulk` to import multiple files simultaneously as a `.tgz` archive.
- **ssl-crl**: Imports a certificate revocation list (CRL).
- **wsdl**: Imports a WSDL file.
- **xml-schema**: Imports an XML schema file.
- **use-mgmt-port**: Uses the management interface as the source interface for the connection to the remote device. The management route table is used to reach the device. Without this option, the ACOS device attempts to use the data route table to reach the remote device through a data interface.
- **url**: Specifies the protocol, user name (if required), and directory path to use for sending the file. You can enter the entire URL on the command line or press Enter to be prompted for each part of the URL. If a password is required, you will be prompted for it. The password can be up to 255 characters long.
  - Example URLs:
    - `tftp://host/file`
    - `ftp://[user@]host[port:]/file`
    - `scp://[user@]host/file`
    - `sftp://[user@]host/file`
- **period seconds**: Enables automated updates of the file. You can specify a period between 60 (one minute) and 31536000 (one year) seconds. This option simplifies the update of imported files, especially those used by multiple ACOS devices. You can edit a single instance of the file on the remote server, then configure each ACOS device to automatically update the file to import the latest changes. When this option is used, the ACOS device periodically replaces the specified file with the version currently on the remote server. If the file is in use in the running configuration, the updated version of the file is placed into memory. The updated file affects only new sessions that begin after the update but does not affect existing sessions.

### Mode
- **Privileged EXEC mode** or **global configuration mode**

### Example
The following command imports an aFleX policy onto the ACOS device from a TFTP server, from its directory named "backups" every 30 days:

```shell
ACOS(config)# import-periodic aflex aflex-01 tftp://192.168.1.101/backups/aflex-01 period 2592000
```

# LDAP Server Configuration

**Document No.: 410-P2-CLI-001 - 6/17/2016 | Page 138**

**A10 Thunder Series and AX Series—Command Line Interface Reference**

## `ldap-server`

### Description
Sets Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) parameters for authenticating administrative access to the ACOS device.

### Syntax
```shell
[no] ldap-server host
{hostname | ipaddr}
{cn cn-name dn dn-name |
domain domain-name [base base-domain] [group group-id]}
[port portnum]
[ssl]
[timeout seconds]
```

- **hostname**: Host name of the LDAP server.
- **ipaddr**: IP address of the LDAP server.
- **cn-name**: Value for the Common Name (CN) attribute.
- **dn-name**: Value for the Distinguished Name (DN) attribute. The DN attribute does not support spaces or quotation marks. For example, the following DN string syntax is valid: `cn=xxx3,dc=maxcrc,dc=com`. The following string is not valid because of the quotation marks and space character: `"cn=xxx3,dc=max crc,dc=com"`.
- **domain-name**: Active Directory domain name.
- **base-domain**: Base domain to which the user belongs.
- **group-id**: Group ID to which the user belongs.
- **portnum**: Protocol port on which the server listens for LDAP traffic. The default is 389.
- **seconds**: Maximum number of seconds the ACOS device waits for a reply from the LDAP server for a given request (1-60 seconds). If the LDAP server does not reply before the timeout, authentication of the admin fails. The default is 44 seconds.
- **ssl**: Authenticate using SSL.

### Default
- No LDAP servers are configured by default. When you add an LDAP server, it has the default settings described in the table above.

### Mode
- **Configuration mode**

### Usage
- LDAP is a AAA protocol that the ACOS device can use to authenticate admins and authorize their management access based on admin account information on external LDAP servers. This release supports the following types of LDAP servers:
  - OpenLDAP
  - Microsoft Active Directory (AD)
- To enable LDAP authentication, use the following command at the global configuration level of the CLI:
  ```shell
  [no] authentication type ldap [method2 [method3 [method4]]]
  ```
- To use backup methods, specify them in the order you want to use them.
- **Nested OUs**: To use nested OUs, specify the nested OU first, then the root. For example, a user account could be nested as follows: `Root OU= Service Accounts -> OU=StaffElevatedAccounts -> UserAccUser1`.
- To configure the ACOS device to provide LDAP AAA for "UserAccUser1", use a command such as the following:
  ```shell
  ldap-server host ldapserver.ad.example.edu cn cn dn ou=StaffElevatedAccounts,ou=ServiceAccounts,dc=ad,dc=example,dc=edu
  ```

### Example
The following commands enable LDAP authentication and add LDAP server 192.168.101.24:

```shell
ACOS(config)# authentication type ldap
ACOS(config)# ldap-server host 192.168.101.24 cn cn dn ou=UserAccount,dc=example,dc=com
```

# Startup Configuration Linking

**Document No.: 410-P2-CLI-001 - 6/17/2016 | Page 140**

**A10 Thunder Series and AX Series—Command Line Interface Reference**

## `link startup-config`

### Description
Links the "startup-config" token to the specified configuration profile. By default, "startup-config" is linked to "default," which means the configuration profile stored in the image area from which the ACOS device most recently rebooted.

### Syntax
```shell
link startup-config {default | profile-name} [primary | secondary]
```

- **default**: Links "startup-config" to the configuration profile stored in the image area from which the ACOS device was most recently rebooted.
- **profile-name**: Links "startup-config" to the specified configuration profile.
- **primary | secondary**: Specifies the image area. If you omit this option, the image area last used to boot is selected.

### Default
- The "startup-config" token is linked to the configuration profile stored in the image area from which the ACOS device was most recently rebooted.

### Mode
- **Configuration mode**

### Usage
- This command enables you to easily test new configurations without replacing the configuration stored in the image area.
- The profile you link to must be stored on the boot device you select. For example, if you use the default boot device (hard disk) selection, the profile you link to must be stored on the hard disk. If you specify `cf`, the profile must be stored on the compact flash. (To display the profiles stored on the boot devices, use the `show startup-config all` command. See "show startup-config" on page 347.)
- After you link "startup-config" to a different configuration profile, configuration management commands that affect "startup-config" affect the linked profile instead of affecting the configuration stored in the image area. For example, if you enter the `write memory` command without specifying a profile name, the command saves the running-config to the linked profile instead of saving it to the configuration stored in the image area.
- Likewise, the next time the ACOS device is rebooted, the linked configuration profile is loaded instead of the configuration that is in the image area.
- To relink "startup-config" to the configuration profile stored in the image area, use the `default` option (e.g., `link startup-config default`).

### Example
- The following command links configuration profile "slbconfig3" with "startup-config":
  ```shell
  ACOS(config)# link startup-config slbconfig3
  ```
- The following command relinks "startup-config" to the configuration profile stored in the image area from which the ACOS device was most recently rebooted:
  ```shell
  ACOS(config)# link startup-config default
  ```
