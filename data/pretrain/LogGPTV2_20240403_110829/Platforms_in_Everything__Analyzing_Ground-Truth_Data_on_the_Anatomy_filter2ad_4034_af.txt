### Comparisons and Anecdotal Evidence

Comparisons with other BPH (Bullet-Proof Hosting) providers, along with anecdotal evidence [4, 13], suggest that MaxiDed can be reasonably considered a major player within the BPH ecosystem. However, some of our findings, particularly those related to the economics and profitability of BPH services, may require further research to better understand the broader BPH ecosystem.

### 13. Discussion and Implications

#### Discussion

Our analysis indicates that MaxiDed has developed a new, agile model in response to detection and disruption strategies. This model has matured to the point where MaxiDed operates a marketplace-like platform for selling BPH services. This innovation transfers the risks associated with acquiring the BP (Bullet-Proof) server infrastructure from upstream providers to merchants. MaxiDed's primary role is to manage the risks of customer acquisition, communication, and payment processing.

The platform hosts 14 merchants who collectively offer over 50,000 different server packages. Many of these packages expired without being purchased. These merchants abused a total of 394 different upstream providers, allowing them to spread and rotate abuse across multiple legitimate networks.

There is some concentration in this supply chain, with 15 upstream providers supplying infrastructure for over 50% of the BP servers sold. Most of these upstream resources are not delegated in WHOIS, significantly reducing the effectiveness of recent detection approaches. Another point of concentration is in the merchant pool: two merchants offered 89% of all BP servers and made 94% of the BP package sales. Most other MaxiDed merchants failed to generate meaningful sales.

The platform used 23 different instruments to transact with customers over various periods. Initially, revenue was largely processed through WebMoney. We also observed an increased volume of Bitcoin payments and the adoption of other cryptocurrencies in response to disruptions in other payment methods, such as PayPal.

A lack of product differentiation on the market likely led to fierce price competition among merchants, which in turn caused many of them to fail. This competition also reduced the profits of both the merchants and MaxiDed itself. Over seven years, MaxiDed's profits amounted to only $280,000 (or $680,000 if we ignore cross-subsidies to their other business, DepFile). The actual profits are even lower, as this amount must cover the costs of personnel, office space, and equipment, for which we had no data.

#### Implications

BPH companies remain a challenging problem as their operators adapt to evade detection and disruption. Previous research in this area has largely relied on external measurements and generally lacks ground-truth data on the internal operations of such providers. Recent detection techniques assume that agile BPH operates under reseller relationships and that upstream providers accurately reflect these relationships in their WHOIS information. Our findings show that MaxiDed deviates from both assumptions, rendering these detection methods less effective.

Previous BPH instances were mainly disrupted by pressuring upstream providers to sever ties with downstream BPH providers. Given the number of available substitute upstream providers for MaxiDed, this approach is unlikely to be an effective chokepoint. Drawing parallels with other underground markets, disruption may be achieved by targeting other chokepoints: merchants, revenue, and demand. MaxiDed’s dominant merchants would have been a viable chokepoint, but identifying them likely required internal operational knowledge, as their existence and identities were not externally visible. As for disrupting payment channels, the transition to mostly unregulated cryptocurrency payments suggests that this is no longer a straightforward option. Surprisingly, MaxiDed’s low profits indicate that increasing transaction or operating costs could be a viable pressure point to disrupt revenue and demand. Future work could explore how to raise these costs. Being aware of the threat of criminal prosecution might, ironically, be one way.

The final remaining pressure point would be to take down the platform. Such takedowns are difficult to replicate and scale. However, MaxiDed explicitly marketed bullet-proof services on the clear web. Even in cases where criminal prosecution is not feasible, if the threat can be made plausible, it might force the company to operate with higher operational security requirements, raising the cost of doing business. This suggests that what appears to be the more difficult strategy might actually be the best option, given the supply chain's increasing agility and evasiveness. Our hope is that by further studying and understanding these emerging agile BPH services, we can inform new and potentially more effective directions for mitigating this threat. To guide future research in this area, researchers might consider deprecating the increasingly misleading metaphor of “bullet-proof” hosting in favor of a term like “agile abuse enablers.”

#### A - Customer Preference Elicitation

**Customer:** Some servers don’t specify what is allowed. Does this mean everything is OK?

**Provider:** What are you looking for?

**Customer:** I’m looking for malware, spam, and botnet C2 hosting. VPS or physical server are both fine.

**Provider:** We allow this here, for example... [provides link to server package configurator]

**Customer:** That says xrumer, warez, adult, ...not what I asked for.

**Provider:** We don’t mention what you want on the public list.

**Customer:** Can you send me a large private list to choose from?

**Provider:** [provides link to dedicated servers located in a country]

**Provider:** Dedicated server prices are above $100.

**Customer:** All of these are in one country, anything in US or EU?

**Provider:** [provides several links to other server package configs]

**Figure 15:** Chat excerpt illustrating customer preference elicitation.

**Figure 15** illustrates an excerpt of a live chat (edited for readability) conducted by one of the authors with MaxiDed operators prior to its takedown. It shows the process of preference elicitation by MaxiDed operators. The conversation was conducted using the live-chat functionality on their webshop. It demonstrates that MaxiDed operators may have also allowed other forms of abuse that they did not publicly mention alongside the various BP server packages advertised on the platform.

#### B - Geographical Distribution of Customer Servers

In analyzing MaxiDed’s platform, we also examined the geographical distribution of its customer servers. We used Maxmind’s commercial historical geo-location data for this purpose. This data is available on a weekly basis. For each customer server, we first found the closest matching Maxmind IP geolocation database with the timespan during which the server was active. We then determined the location of each server based on its IP address and Maxmind’s datasets. **Figure 16** plots the top-20 locations for MaxiDed’s customer servers. We found that the majority of the BP servers were geolocated to Moldova, followed by Russia, the US, Ukraine, the Netherlands, and a long tail of other countries. **Figure 16** also displays the number of non-BP servers in each of these top-20 locations. We observed that the Netherlands, in particular, hosted a substantial number of the non-BP servers.

**Figure 16:** Top-20 locations for MaxiDed customer servers.
