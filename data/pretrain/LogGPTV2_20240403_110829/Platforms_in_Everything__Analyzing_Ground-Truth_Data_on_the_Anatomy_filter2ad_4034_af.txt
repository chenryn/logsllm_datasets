comparisons with other BPH providers in addition to anecdo-
tal evidence [4, 13] suggest that MaxiDed may be reasonably
considered as a major provider within the ecosystem. Nev-
ertheless, some of our ﬁndings, particularly those relating to
the economics and proﬁtability of BPH services may require
further research to better understand the BPH ecosystem as a
whole.
13 Discussion and Implications
(Discussion.) We found MaxiDed to have developed a new
agile model in response to detection and disruption strategies.
Its operations had matured to the point of a new innovation,
namely operating a marketplace-like platform for selling BPH
services. This model transfers the risks of acquiring the BP
server infrastructure from upstream providers to merchants.
MaxiDed ’s main role was to take on the risks of acquiring
customers, communicating with them and processing their
payments. The 14 merchants on the platform (over)-supplied
the market with more than 50K different server packages,
many of which expired without being purchased. They abused
a total of set 394 different upstream providers, thus allowing
merchants to spread out and rotate abuse across many different
legitimate networks.
We see some concentration in this supply chain, with 15
upstreams providing infrastructure for over 50% of the BP
servers sold. Most of these upstream resources are not shown
to be delegated in WHOIS, drastically curtailing the effective-
ness of the most recent detection approaches. Another point of
concentration is in the merchant pool: two merchants offered
89% of all BP servers and made 94% of the BP packages sales.
Most other MaxiDed merchants failed to generate any mean-
ingful sales. The platform deployed 23 different instruments
to transact with customers over various periods. Revenue was
initially largely processed by one payment settlement system:
WebMoney. We also saw an increased volume of BitCoin
payments and the adoption of other cryptocurrencies in re-
sponse to disruptions in other instruments, such as PayPal.
A lack of product differentiation on the market is likely to
have created a ﬁerce price competition across the merchants
which in turn has led a great proportion of merchants to fail.
This competition also decreases the proﬁts of not only the
merchants, but also of MaxiDed itself. Its proﬁts, over seven
years, amounted to a mere 280K USD (or 680K USD if we
ignore cross subsidies to their other business, DepFile). The
actual proﬁts are even lower, as this amount also has to cover
the cost of personnel, ofﬁce space and equipment, on which
we had no data.
(Implications.) Bullet-proof hosting (BPH) companies re-
main a difﬁcult problem as their operators adapt to evade
detection and disruption. Prior work in this area has largely
relied on external measurements and generally lacks ground-
truth data on the internal operations of such providers. Recent
detection techniques rely on certain assumptions, namely that
agile BPH operates under reseller relationships, and that up-
stream providers accurately reﬂect such relationships in their
WHOIS information. We found MaxiDed to deviate from both
assumptions, thus rendering detection less effective.
Prior BPH instances were mainly disrupted by pressur-
ing upstream providers to sever ties with downstream BPH
providers. Given the number of available substitute upstream
providers of MaxiDed, this is unlikely to be an effective choke-

point. Drawing parallels with other underground markets sug-
gest that, other than taking down the platform itself, disruption
may also be achieved by pressuring other chokepoints: mer-
chants, revenue and demand. MaxiDed’s dominant merchants
would have been a viable chokepoint, yet, identifying them
most likely required internal operational knowledge as their
existence and identities were not externally visible. As for
disrupting payment channels, the transition to mostly unregu-
lated cryptocurrencies payments suggest that this is no longer
a straightforward option. Surprisingly, MaxiDed’s low proﬁts
indicate that an increase in transaction or operating costs may
be viable a pressure point to disrupt revenue and demand.
Future work could explore how to raise these costs. Being
aware of the threat of criminal prosecution might, ironically,
be one way.
The ﬁnal remaining pressure point would be to take down
the platform. Such takedowns however are hard to replicate,
let alone scale. That being said, MaxiDed explicitly marketed
bullet proof services on the clear web. Even in cases when
criminal prosecution itself is not feasible, if the threat can be
made plausible, it might force the company to operate within
higher op sec requirements, raising the cost of doing business.
This suggests that what appears the more difﬁcult strategy
might actually be the best option in light of the supply chain
becoming even more agile and evasive. Our hope is that by
further studying and understanding of these emerging agile
BPH services we can inform new and potentially more effec-
tive directions for mitigating this threat. To orient future work
in this area, researchers might be better off deprecating the
increasingly misleading metaphor of “bullet-proof” hosting
in favor of a term like “agile abuse enablers”.

A - Customer Preference Elicitation
Customer : Some servers don’t specify what is allowed. does this mean everything is OK?
Provider: What are you looking for?
Customer : I’m looking for malware, spam and botnet C2 hosting , VPS or physical server
are both fine
Provider: We allow this here for example ... [provides link to server package
configurator]
Customer : That says xrumer, warez, adult, ...not what I asked for
Provider: We don’t mention what you want on the public list
Customer : Can you send me a large private list to choose from?
Provider: [provides link to dedicated servers located in a country]
Provider: Dedicated server prices are above 100
Customer : All of these are in one country, anything in US or EU?
Provider: [provides several links to other server package configs]

operators prior to its takedown. It shows the process of pref-
erence elicitation by MaxiDed operators.
The conversation was conducted using the live-chat func-
tionality on their webshop. It demonstrates that MaxiDed op-
erators may have also allowed other forms of abuse which
they did not publicly mention on their webshop along side the
various BP server packages that the platform advertised.
B - Geographical distribution of Customer Servers
In analyzing MaxiDed’s platform, we also examined where
its customer servers were located. We used Maxmind’s com-
mercial historical geo-location data for this purpose. This
data is available on a weekly basis. For each customer server
we ﬁrst found the closest matching Maxmind IP geoloca-
tion database with the timespan during which the server was
active. We then determined were each server was located
based on its IP address and Maxmind’s datasets. Figure 16
plots the top-20 locations for MaxiDed’s customer servers.
We
found that
the majority of
the BP servers
geolocated
to
Moldova followed
by Russia,
the
US, Ukraine, the
Netherlands and
a
long tail of
other
countries.
Figure 16 also
displays the number of non-BP servers in each of these top-20
locations. We observed that the Netherlands in particular
hosted a substantial number of the non-BP servers.
