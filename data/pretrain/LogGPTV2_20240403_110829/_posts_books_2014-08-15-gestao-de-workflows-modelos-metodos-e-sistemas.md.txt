**Gestão de Workflows: Modelos, Métodos e Sistemas**

Aalst and Hee (Translation: Cardoso). UC Press 2009.

This book provides a comprehensive introduction to workflow management, which is the process of managing business operations using information technology. By defining, analyzing, and redesigning an organization's resources and operations, workflow management systems ensure that the right information reaches the right person or computer application at the right time.

The book begins with a basic overview of workflow terminology and organizational structures. It then delves into detailed coverage of workflow modeling using Petri nets. Petri nets are particularly useful because they make definitions more accessible to non-experts, facilitating communication between designers and users.

Key features of the book include:
- A thorough explanation of workflow management concepts.
- Detailed coverage of workflow modeling with Petri nets.
- A chapter dedicated to real-world case studies.
- Review exercises to reinforce learning.
- A comprehensive glossary of terms.
