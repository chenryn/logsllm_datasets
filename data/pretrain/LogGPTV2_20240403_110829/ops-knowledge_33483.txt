User: I am planning to automate a process of cleaning file systems in Linux using a set of scripts in Shell, Python and I'll create a simple dashboard using Node.js to allow a more visual approach.
I have a script in Shell which already cleans a file system in a specific server - but I have to login and then issue this command. Now I am proceeding with a dashboard in HTML/CSS/JS to visualize all servers which are having space problems.
My idea is: create a Python scrip to login and get a list of filesystems and its usage and update a single JSON file, then, my dashboard uses this JSON to feed the screen.
My question is how to get the list of file system in Linux and its usage?
Assistant: You can use command 
df
Provides an option to display sizes in Human Readable formats  (e.g., 1K 1M 1G) by using ‘-h’.This is the most common command but
you can also check du and di. di in fact provides even more info than df.
