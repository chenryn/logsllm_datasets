User: I wish to execute os.system('ls') in python. the return value of this statement is an error code integer..but I want to  get the contents of the present directory as a string. How to accomplish this?
Assistant: Python as build-in functionality like os.listdir() or os.walk() for listing stuff
on the filesystem. Running 'ls' yourself is very bad-style. In general look at the documentation of the subprocess module giving you all flexibility for interacting with external commands.
