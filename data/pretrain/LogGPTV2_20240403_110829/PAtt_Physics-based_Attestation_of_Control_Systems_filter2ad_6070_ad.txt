operation does not overlap with the curve of the occurrence
probability distribution of the two-bit approximation attack,
which demonstrates that we can precisely detect the two-bit
approximation attack (e.g., by choosing τ = 1). Figure 5c
shows the curve of the occurrence probability distribution of
the normal operation did not overlap with the curve of the
occurrence probability distribution of the replay attack, which
means that we can also precisely detect replay attacks (e.g.,
by choosing τ = 1).
In our experiments (see Table 3), ﬁrst we studied the per-
formance of PAtt with different values of the τ, from 0.8 to 1.
We used the 60 traces of the normal operation and 60 traces of
attacks in total. The true negative (TN) is the number of nor-
mal operation instances that are correctly classiﬁed as normal
operation. The false positive (FP) is the number of normal
operation instances that are wrongly classiﬁed as an attack.
The true positive (TP) is the number of attack instances that
are correctly classiﬁed as an attack. The false-negative (FN)
is the number of attack instances that are wrongly classiﬁed
as normal operation. We conﬁrmed that τ = 1 yields ideal per-
formance in normal operations of the system. In the absence
of attacks, our processing of the sensor reading traces always
produces a hash that is classiﬁed as authentic. In addition,
we can detect the implemented attacks attack with Accuracy
of 89%, sensitivity of 78%, and Matthews Correlation Co-
efﬁcient (MCC) of 0.80. Both the two hash approximation
attack and replay attack was detected without any false neg-
ative. Choosing the best value of the τ is dependent on the
operational requirements of the control processes. However,
if the operation of the system could tolerate the false posi-
tives (which would probably trigger the alarm even during
the normal operation), we could choose the τ = 0.95 which
can detect the implemented attacks attack with Accuracy of
97%, the sensitivity of 96%, and MCC of 0.95.
6 Discussion
We now provide an additional discussion on the scalability
of our approach, practical issues with critical zones, and the
use-case scenarios.
6.1 Complexity/Scalability
The PAtt uses physical complexity (physical behavior) as a
root-of-trust. By adding more sensors or actuators to the con-
trol processes, we could achieve a more robust model that

could verify the integrity of the control processes by wrap-
ping this complexity over actuation strategy and the hash. In
addition to the favor of complexity, the PAtt is designed to be
scalable, and it could detect the change of physical complex-
ity (physical behavior) as we have seen in the Section 5 by
detecting the replay attacks which would report a table-based
replay of physical behavior. These features of the PAtt would
make it feasible to authenticate a physical process over an
actuation strategy derived from a random hash.
6.2 Application to other PLCs
We used some APIs from the S7-1200 PLCs to perform
the memory measurements and hash generation. The same
functionality can be provided on other PLCs if they support
the APIs. However, the memory measurement could be pro-
grammed directly in the control logic of the PLCs with some
engineering effort.
6.3 Critical Zones
Given that this attestation routine is being integrated into
safety-critical processes, there are restrictions on when the
attestation process can be performed. We refer to these re-
strictions as critical zones. During a critical zone, the physical
process is engaged in a ﬁxed actuation and thus cannot be
interrupted by an attestation. As an example, in 3D printing,
a critical zone would be when the printer head is extruding
ﬁlament. In addition to timing, the safety-critical zone must
also include a spacial component, as actuation generated by
the attestation process must not collide with anything and also
stay within the range of motion of the system. A consequence
of this is that processes that have no downtime or are always
performing some critical action cannot utilize this augmented
attestation method.
6.4 Example Applicable Use-Case Scenarios
In this section, we describe the application of our attestation
scheme in several use-cases. We designed and implemented
PAtt in a robotic arm controlled by a PLC, and we showed
the applicability and security signiﬁcance of the PAtt in a
real-world ICS. However, PAtt applies to other CPS as well,
where the control process meets the following conditions:
• The control process has the ability to perform high-speed
actuation (such as the 200 kHz PWM signal board that
we used in the implementation of PAtt).
• The control process has powerful sensors that are able
to report the current state of the physical process via a
high-speed channel.
Automated Manufacturing. The ﬁrst use case is automated
manufacturing, which involves machinery similar to our im-
plementation on a robotic arm. These types of setups are
common in automotive assembly, where a robotic arm manip-
ulates objects in 3D space. Actuation is carefully controlled
and monitored by a PLC. In this situation, the critical zone
occurs when the arm is manipulating an object. Conversely,
when the arm is not gripping an object, the attestation process
can be initiated. As described in the previous section, the con-
ventional attestation report is encoded into micro-actuation
of the robotic arm, resulting in sensor readings to corroborate
the authenticity of the attestation report. In this case, the ini-
tiation of the attestation process must also take into account
the spacial constraints given that the arm must not contact any
objects during the attestation process.
Additive and Subtractive Manufacturing. Additive manu-
facturing processes, most commonly referring to 3D printing,
consist of a printer head extruding heated ﬁlament in succes-
sive 2D layers to produce a product. The printing process is
controlled by a micro-controller controlling several stepper
motors. Designs are created in one of the various 3D printing
programs and converted to a standard language of instruc-
tions known as G-code. In recent years, this technology has
seen rapid growth leading not only to 3D printed parts used
in a greater variety of applications, including safety-critical
ones like medical prostheses. Consequently, it is essential to
consider the security aspect of these applications, and much
work has been done in this area already. The application of
our attestation scheme to this process is complicated by the
fact that conventional 3D printers lack the physical sensor
channels leveraged in the robotic arm use-case, only being
equipped with several limit switches for initial calibration,

hard-coded characterization of the stepper motors controlling
the motion of the printer head. However, this can easily be
remedied through the placement of external sensors, like the
accelerometers used in the robotic arm case, on to the printer
head to provide a physical sensing channel to provide actua-
