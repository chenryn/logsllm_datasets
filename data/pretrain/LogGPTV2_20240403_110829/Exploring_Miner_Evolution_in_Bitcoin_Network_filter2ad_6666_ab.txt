### 1. Introduction

The following sections provide an in-depth analysis of the Bitcoin network, focusing on the economic model, monthly generation of Bitcoins and USD, and the evolution of solo and pool miners over time.

### 2. Economic Model

We extend our simple economic model to estimate the maximum sustainable computation power in the Bitcoin network. Let:
- \(\xi_0\) be the highest computation-over-power efficiency (in units of hash-per-second/kilowatt) that future computation technology can achieve.
- \(\eta_0\) be the lowest electricity price in the world.
- \(\rho_0\) be the steady-state exchange price of Bitcoin.

Using these parameters, we can calculate the maximum sustainable computation power \(H\) in the entire Bitcoin network as:

\[
\eta_0 = 6R\rho_0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad H = \frac{6R\xi_0\rho_0}{\eta_0}
\]

Here, the left-hand side of the first equation represents the minimum electricity charge for one hour of mining with the most efficient hardware. The right-hand side is the expected hourly total payout in the network at a target mining rate of one block every ten minutes. If the total computation power exceeds \(H\), the profit margins for all miners become negative, leading some to drop out, which in turn restores positive profit margins. Note that this model ignores capital and other operational costs, thus providing an upper bound on the maximum sustainable computation power at any fixed Bitcoin price \(\rho_0\), given the highest feasible computation efficiency \(\xi_0\) and the lowest electricity price \(\eta_0\).

### 3. Characterization Results

#### 3.1 Monthly Generation of Bitcoins and USD

Figure 1a shows the total Bitcoins generated each month. In 2009, the numbers are unstable due to the recent release of the Bitcoin client and the small size of the network. In December 2012, the reward \(R\) for each block was reduced from 50 BTCs to 25 BTCs, resulting in a 50% reduction in the number of BTCs generated in subsequent months. Figure 1b illustrates the monthly USD value generated based on the daily Bitcoin to USD exchange rate.

#### 3.2 Distribution of Solo Miners' Earnings

Figure 2 depicts the distribution of solo miners' annual earnings. Before August 2010, there was no market data, and the estimated BTC value was $0. The earnings in later years were significantly higher due to the rapid increase in the exchange price. Additionally, top miners became more powerful and responsible for creating the majority of blocks. We estimate the hash rate of each solo miner based on the number of blocks they created. Figure 3 shows the minimum, maximum, and mean hash rates of solo miners, along with the system-regulated difficulty value on a logarithmic scale. Initially, the computation power was evenly distributed among miners, but it became highly skewed over time, with a few very powerful miners dominating the network. These top miners are, in fact, mining pools.

#### 3.3 Transfer Lag of Mined Bitcoins

We examined the speed at which miners transfer their mined Bitcoins by measuring the time lag between a miner claiming a block and their next transaction. If a miner had no subsequent transactions in our trace, they were tagged as frozen. For active miners, we calculated the average and distribution of their transfer lags. Table 1 shows that a large fraction of early miners were frozen and never touched their mined Bitcoins, even after the Bitcoin price surge in 2013. We conjecture that these early miners were casual adopters who did not foresee the financial potential of Bitcoin. Many may have lost their account IDs, making it impossible to cash out. This suggests that many Bitcoins mined in the first two years might have been lost permanently. The situation changed in 2011, coinciding with the increase in Bitcoin's value. Almost all miners became active, and the transfer lag decreased over time. Figure 4 further illustrates this trend, indicating that later miners were driven by profit and transferred their mined Bitcoins diligently.

### 4. Pool Mining

Figure 5a shows the evolution of the number of miners in F2Pool. From May to October 2013, the number of pool miners remained relatively stable. This stability indicates a mature and well-established pool mining ecosystem.
