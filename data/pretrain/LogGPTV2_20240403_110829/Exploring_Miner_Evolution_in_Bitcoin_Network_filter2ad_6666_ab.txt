extrapolating on our simple economic model in the previous section. Namely,
let ξ0 be the highest computation-over-power eﬃciency (in unit of hash-per-
second/kilowatt) that the future computation technology can achieve, η0 be the
lowest electricity price in the world, and ρ0 be the steady state exchange price
of Bitcoin, then we can immediately calculate the maximum sustainable compu-
tation power H in the whole Bitcoin network as:
η0 = 6Rρ0, ⇒ H =
6Rξ0ρ0
(7)
,
H
ξ0
η0
where the left-hand side of the ﬁrst equation is the minimum electricity charge
for one-hour mining with the most eﬃcient mining hardware, and the right-
hand side of the ﬁrst equation is the expected hourly total payout in the whole
network at the target mining rate of one block every ten minutes. If the total
computation power goes above H, the expected proﬁt margins of all miners
become negative, some of them will start to drop out the mining race, which
in turn brings back the proﬁt margin to positive. So far we ignored the capital
cost and other operational costs. Therefore (7) gives us an upper bound on the
maximum sustainable computation power at any ﬁxed Bitcoin price ρ0, given
the highest feasible computation eﬃciency ξ0 and the lowest electricity price η0.
5 Characterization Results
Figure 1a plots the total Bitcoins generated each month. In 2009, the numbers
are not stable because the Bitcoin client was newly released and the size of
the network was relatively small. In December 2012, the reward R for each
block was reduced from 50 BTCs to 25 BTCs, resulting in the number of BTCs
was reduced by half in the latter months. Figure 1b shows how much USD are
generated monthly according to the daily Bitcoin to USD exchange price.

Fig. 4. Transfer lag distribution
5.1 Solo Miners
Figure 2 illustrates the distribution of solo miners’ annually earnings. Before
August 2010, there is no market data and the estimation of BTC value is $0.
The earnings in latter years are tremendously greater than in the earlier years
due to the exchange price went up rapidly. In addition, top miners became more
and more powerful and were responsible for the most blocks created. Similar to
(3), we estimate the hash rate of each solo miner based on the number of blocks
she created. Figure 3 shows the minimum, maximum and mean hash rate of solo
miners together with the system regulated diﬃculty value in logarithm scale. It
shows that the computation power are evenly distributed among miners at the
early stage, then become highly skewed with a small number of very powerful
miners as the Bitcoin network evolves. As will be studied next, those top miners
are indeed mining pools.
We now examine how fast miners transfer out mined Bitcoins. We measure
the time lag between a miner claimed a block and her next transaction. If a
miner has no subsequent transaction in our trace, we tag the minor as frozen. For
active miners, we calculate the average and distribution of their transfer lags.
As shown in Table 1, a large fraction of early miners were frozen and never

Fig. 5. (a) F2Pool miner growth, (b) F2Pool computation share
touched their mined Bitcoins, even after the Bitcoin price surge in 2013. Our
conjecture is that those early miners were casual early adopters of Bitcoin as
a fun technology, and they were not motivated by the potential ﬁnancial value
of Bitcoin. When Bitcoin became valuable, they might have, unfortunately, lost
their account IDs, so that couldn’t cash out. This suggests that lots of Bitcoins
mined in the ﬁrst two years might have been lost permanently! Things changed
completely in 2011, not surprisingly, this is in sync with the value increase of
Bitcoin. Not only almost all miners are active, the lag for transfer gets shorter
and shorter. The slight increase in frozen ratio from 2012 to 2013 is due to
the artifact that our trace ends in March 2014. Figure 4 further illustrates the
decrease trend of transfer lags as time evolves. This suggests that later miners
were explicitly driven by proﬁts and diligently transferred out mined Bitcoins.
5.2 Pool Mining
Figure 5a shows the evolution of the number of miners in F2Pool. We can see that
from May to October 2013, the number of pool miners is relatively stable. This
