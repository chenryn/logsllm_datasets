User: According to the following description, provide a cloud computing architecture design scheme. The company needs a cloud computing platform that supports high availability, high performance, and flexibility to run large-scale business systems. It is required to support functions such as automatic expansion, load balancing, containerized deployment, and monitoring and alarming. At the same time, requirements such as security and data isolation need to be met. The company has hundreds of application systems and thousands of servers. These systems and servers need to be managed centrally to achieve unified scheduling and use of resources and improve operation and maintenance efficiency. At the same time, it needs to support multi-tenancy and provide independent computing and storage resources for different users.
Assistant: Based on the above requirements, the following cloud computing architecture can be designed: 1. Infrastructure layer: use virtualization technology to build cloud infrastructure, and open source KVM, Xen and other virtualization software as well as commercial virtualization software such as VMware and Hyper-V can be used. Virtual machine management uses OpenStack as the infrastructure management platform, and OpenStack provides automatic management of virtual machines, including virtual machine instance creation, deletion, stopping, starting, and resource scheduling. OpenStack can integrate a variety of open source tools to achieve multi-tenant management, network management, storage management, etc. 2. Middleware layer: Use containerization technology as middleware to implement application deployment and management. Kubernetes is currently a relatively mature container management platform, which can automatically expand and load balance, while providing monitoring and logging functions. Through Kubernetes, application systems can be packaged into containers to achieve cross-platform deployment and operation. The container management system can be integrated with the OpenStack virtual machine management platform to achieve integrated management. 3. Data storage layer: use a distributed storage system to meet multi-tenant requirements and data isolation requirements. Ceph is a commonly used distributed storage system with high availability and scalability. Using Ceph, data objects can be stored on different physical storage devices to improve data redundancy and reliability. At the same time, Ceph provides a variety of interfaces for direct access by other applications, and can also be integrated with OpenStack to manage storage resource pools. 4. Security protection layer: The cloud computing platform must ensure security, and various security technologies can be used for protection. For example, virtualization security technology, network security technology, access control technology, etc. can be used to reduce security risks. OpenStack provides some security features, such as identity authentication, access control, encrypted transmission, audit trail, etc., and can also be integrated with other security solutions. 5. Integrated management layer: Through the integrated management of the cloud computing platform, centralized management and scheduling of multi-tenants and multi-nodes can be realized. Maximize the utilization of cloud computing platform resources and improve the efficiency of operation and maintenance. Open source tools such as OpenStack and Kubernetes can be used for comprehensive management to realize functions such as resource pool management, billing management, and monitoring and alarming. At the same time, an API interface is provided for other applications to call. The above cloud computing architecture mainly adopts open source tools to realize a cloud computing platform with high availability, high performance, flexibility and security, while providing functions such as automatic expansion, load balancing, containerized deployment, and monitoring and alarming. Through centralized management and scheduling, resource utilization and operation and maintenance efficiency are improved to meet the needs of multi-tenants and data isolation requirements.
