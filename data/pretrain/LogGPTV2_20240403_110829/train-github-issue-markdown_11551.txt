When examining the Meson-generated `build.ninja` file on a Windows machine that replicates the CI build environment, it appears that only GCC is being used, with no indication of MSVC usage. Is this observation accurate? If so, it would be beneficial to document this in the Meson build FAQ.

Additionally, it seems that the build process requires the RTools GCC compiler, as I have encountered issues with the standard MinGW toolchain.

Another point of concern: when running `meson build --debug` on Windows, the GCC flags are set to `"-O2" "-g"`. Is the use of `-O2` for debug builds intentional?
