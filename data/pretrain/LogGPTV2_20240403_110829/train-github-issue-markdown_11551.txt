When looking at the meson-generated `build.ninja` on windows, on a machine
that is duplicating the CI build, it seems there is no use of msvc only gcc.
Is this correct? If so it might be nice to document this in the meson build
faq. Also I think the build requires the rtools gcc compiler, I have had
problems with standard mingw.
Another niggle: `meson build --debug` on windows sets the gcc flags to `"-O2"
"-g"`. Is using `-O2` intentional for the debug builds?
