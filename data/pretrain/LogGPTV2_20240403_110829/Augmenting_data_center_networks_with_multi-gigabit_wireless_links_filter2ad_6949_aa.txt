## Abstract
The emerging 60 GHz wireless technology offers the potential for dense, high-speed connectivity at a low cost. This paper explores the use of 60 GHz links to alleviate hotspots in oversubscribed data center (DC) networks. Through experiments with prototype equipment, we demonstrate that the DC environment is well-suited for deploying 60 GHz links, despite concerns about interference and reliability. By using directional antennas, multiple wireless links can operate concurrently at multi-gigabit per second (Gbps) rates on top-of-rack (ToR) switches. The wired DC network can help mitigate common wireless issues. Analysis of production traces from four real applications shows that adding a small amount of network capacity in the form of wireless flyways can significantly improve performance. However, one-hop indirect routing is necessary to achieve substantial benefits. Based on our 60 GHz experiments and traffic analysis, we present a design that dynamically selects and adds flyways to the wired DC network. Trace-driven evaluations indicate that network-limited DC applications with predictable traffic workloads running on a 1:2 oversubscribed network can be sped up by 45% in 95% of cases with just one wireless device per ToR switch. With two devices, the performance matches that of a non-oversubscribed network in 40% of cases.

## 1. Introduction
Millimeter-wave wireless technology, particularly in the 60 GHz band, is rapidly advancing. This band, available worldwide for unlicensed use, offers over 80 times the bandwidth of 802.11b/g at 2.4 GHz and supports multi-Gbps data rates. The high frequency results in rapid signal attenuation, allowing dense deployment with directional antennas. Advances in VLSI technology now enable 60 GHz radio hardware to be built using CMOS, with companies like SiBeam promising to deliver 60 GHz devices at less than $10 per unit in bulk quantities. In summary, 60 GHz technology can provide dense, high-bandwidth wireless connectivity at a low cost.

To date, 60 GHz technology has been explored primarily for isolated point-to-point links, such as home entertainment systems where a Blu-Ray player communicates wirelessly with a nearby television. In this paper, we consider the novel possibility of using 60 GHz links in a data center (DC) to augment the wired network. This approach is promising for several reasons. First, the dense packing of machines in a DC makes high-bandwidth, short-range wireless devices a natural fit. Second, the static radio environment minimizes fluctuations in link quality. Third, line-of-sight communication is achievable by mounting 60 GHz radios on top of racks. Finally, the wired DC network can be used to coordinate wireless devices, simplifying traditional wireless problems such as aligning directional senders and receivers and avoiding interference.

Traditional, wired DC networks are tree-structured and often oversubscribed to reduce costs. For example, a typical DC rack comprises 40 machines connected to a top-of-rack (ToR) switch with 1 Gbps links, which is then connected to an aggregation switch with 10 Gbps links, leading to a 1:4 oversubscription ratio. Each oversubscribed link can become a hotspot, hindering DC application performance. Recent research addresses this issue by combining more links and switches with multipath routing, but this comes with significant material and implementation costs. Some designs require so many wires that cabling becomes a challenge, and most require "fork lift" upgrades to the entire infrastructure.

In prior work, we argued for a more modest addition of links to relieve hotspots and boost application performance. These additional links, called flyways, add extra capacity to the base network to alleviate hotspots. When the traffic matrix is sparse (i.e., only a few ToR switches are hot), a small number of flyways can significantly improve performance without the cost of building a fully non-oversubscribed network.

The basic design of a DC network with 60 GHz flyways involves provisioning the base wired network for average cases, which can be oversubscribed. Each ToR switch is equipped with one or more 60 GHz wireless devices with electronically steerable directional antennas. A central controller monitors DC traffic patterns and switches the beams of the wireless devices to set up flyways between ToR switches as needed.

Other researchers have explored the use of fiber optic cables and MEMS switches for creating flyways. We believe that 60 GHz flyways are an attractive choice because they simplify DC upgrades by eliminating the need for wiring changes. Additionally, 60 GHz technology is likely to become inexpensive due to consumer applications, while optical switches remain costly. However, wireless devices can introduce additional management challenges, such as handling dynamic topologies. Before considering these factors, we must first understand whether 60 GHz wireless will perform well in the DC environment despite challenges related to interference and reliability. This is the primary focus of this paper.

We make three contributions. First, we report experiments with prototype 60 GHz devices and measurement-based simulations that show the feasibility of 60 GHz networks in the DC. To our knowledge, we are the first to report such results. Second, we analyze four DC traffic traces and show that real workloads have few hotspots even when they lack predictable elephant flows, implying that flyways can provide substantial benefits at low cost. Prior work has used synthetic workloads. Third, we present the design of a 60 GHz wireless flyway system motivated by our measurements. It differs from previous work on flyways in its use of indirect routing to achieve good gains. A trace-driven evaluation shows that in a 73-rack cluster with a 1:2 oversubscribed network and just one wireless device per ToR, our system improves the performance of a network-limited DC application by 45% in 95% of cases. With two devices per ToR, the performance is identical to that of a non-oversubscribed network in 40% of cases.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides background on 60 GHz technology. Section 3 presents experiments and simulations showing the feasibility of 60 GHz data center deployments. Section 4 analyzes DC traffic traces to understand the required flyway characteristics. Section 5 presents the design of our system, followed by evaluation results in Section 6. We conclude with a discussion in Section 7, related work in Section 8, and our conclusions in Section 9.

## 2. 60 GHz Technology
Recent advances in CMOS technology have significantly reduced the cost of 60 GHz devices, leading to commercial interest in indoor applications. This differs from initial, limited uses of 60 GHz for outdoor, point-to-point infrastructure. This section provides a brief primer on the 60 GHz physical layer and ongoing research and standardization efforts.

The nature of 60 GHz radio waves presents significant challenges for operating high-rate links. Compared to a 2.4 GHz link, a 60 GHz link is roughly 55 dB worse in terms of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), due to higher free-space path loss, wider channels, and lower transmit power. To compensate, indoor 60 GHz technologies such as 802.11ad target a short range of 10 meters and use highly directional antennas.

Directionality is the key aspect of 60 GHz technology, enabling dense indoor deployment. Directional antennas support multi-Gbps rates over distances of several meters. For fixed links, physically directional antennas are used, while for dynamic links, phased array antennas are employed. Phased array antennas can change their radiation pattern electronically, with no moving parts.

WirelessHD and IEEE 802.11ad/WiGig are the main ongoing efforts to standardize the PHY and MAC of the 60 GHz band. WirelessHD is designed for streaming media in home entertainment systems and is not suitable for general data communication. IEEE 802.11ad enhances 802.11 for 60 GHz, supporting data rates from 385 Mbps to 6.76 Gbps. We use 802.11ad as the starting point for our flyway system.

## 3. 60 GHz Links in the Data Center
This section investigates whether 60 GHz links perform well in a DC environment, focusing on steady, high throughput in a dense deployment. We first measure 60 GHz propagation, link stability, and spatial reuse using prototype 60 GHz hardware. We then use these measurements to simulate dense collections of 60 GHz links in the DC, guiding our system design.

### 3.1 Hardware
Our results are based on a device built by HXI, which provides a full-duplex, 60 GHz Gigabit Ethernet data link. It has a 1000BASE-SX fiber interface and directly modulates the 1.25 Gbps line rate Ethernet protocol onto a 60 GHz carrier wave using On-Off-Keying (OOK). The device employs frequency division to support full-duplex links and has an SNMP management interface for continuous SNR estimates.

The device interfaces with removable antennas using the standard 60 GHz WR-15 waveguide. We use two directional antennas: a wide-beam horn antenna (WB) and a narrow-beam horn antenna (NB). We measured their radiation patterns in a large, free-space environment, and the actual gain values differ slightly from manufacturer claims.

### 3.2 Propagation and Link Stability
We set up a 60 GHz link in our data center using HXI devices with NB antennas, deployed atop two racks facing each other across an aisle. We ran a long-lived TCP flow for 24 hours, measuring throughput and SNR every second. During the last five minutes, one of the authors repeatedly walked under the link.

The results show that the link SNR and TCP throughput are stable, achieving the full 1 Gbps rate with almost no variation. Even during the last five minutes, there was no variation in throughput. To provide a counterpoint, we set up a link at 3 feet above the ground and walked across it, resulting in significant variation due to line-of-sight obstruction.

These results indicate that in a typical DC, line-of-sight 60 GHz links set up at rack height provide stable performance.

### 3.3 Interference (Spatial Reuse)
We also studied the properties of multiple active flyways. Our system requires multiple flyways to be active simultaneously. Using directional antennas, many wireless links can run concurrently at multi-Gbps rates on ToR switches. The wired DC network can help coordinate these links, reducing interference and improving overall performance.
