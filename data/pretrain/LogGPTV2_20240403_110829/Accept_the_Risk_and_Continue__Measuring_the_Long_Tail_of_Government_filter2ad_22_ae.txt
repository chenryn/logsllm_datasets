A APPENDIX
A.1 Case Study 1: United States of America
The United States of America issued a memorandum M-15-13 in 2015 mandating the requirement of secure https connections across all
federal websites and web services that belong to the United States government. As a result, the General Services Administration publicly
provides 15 datasets at the granularity of State, Federal, Local governments in addition to the 2016 End of Presidential Term (EoT) snapshot
which have mostly been archived. We create an additional dataset full-federal-removed-diff which contains the websites obtained from a set
subtraction between the Current Federal Domains & Govt. Federal Only Domains. In Table A.1 we indicate the total number of websites
reachable, the number of them which support http only, those which support https and those which support loading page content in
both. We also breakdown each dataset with the corresponding certificate validity and leave out the remaining unavailable websites. We also
provide a detailed breakdown of the dataset with the reasons for certificate invalidity and common errors in Table A.2.
