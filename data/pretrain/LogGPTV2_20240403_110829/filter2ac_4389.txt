**ATT&CK ID:** M1037  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Filter Network Traffic

**Mitigation:**
Some variants of this technique can be mitigated through the use of stateful firewalls, depending on their specific implementation. Stateful firewalls monitor and track the state of network connections, allowing them to filter traffic more effectively by contextually understanding the flow of data. This capability can help in detecting and blocking malicious traffic patterns that might otherwise go unnoticed by simpler, stateless filtering mechanisms.
