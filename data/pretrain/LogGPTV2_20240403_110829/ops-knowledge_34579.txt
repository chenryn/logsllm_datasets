User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How can I make Haproxy don't send SNI field to backend server? Following reverse proxy work for en.wikipedia.org but not zh.wikipedia.org, my censor prevents access to zh.wikipedia.org by SNI. if no SNI then just correct IP in /etc/hosts is enough.

Original configuration:

defaults
    log 127.0.0.1:514 user
    timeout connect 5000s
    timeout client 5000s
    timeout server 5000s
listen reverse-proxy
    bind 127.0.0.1:443
    mode tcp
    balance static-rr
    server srv1 208.80.153.224




Following reverse proxy cause Firefox say:


  This site uses HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) to specify that
  Firefox may only connect to it securely. As a result, it is not
  possible to add an exception for this certificate.


Changed configuration:

global
    tune.ssl.default-dh-param 2048
defaults
    log 127.0.0.1:514 user
    timeout connect 5000s
    timeout client 5000s
    timeout server 5000s
listen reverse-proxy
    bind 127.0.0.1:443 ssl crt /home/test/wiki.pem
    mode http
    http-response set-header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=16000000; includeSubDomains; preload;"
    balance static-rr
    server srv1 208.80.153.224 ssl verify none

Assistant: In this configuration you cannot, because you're using mode tcp proxying, so your haproxy's just transparently passing the entire HTTP session to the backend. You should switch to the mode http and manipulate headers.
