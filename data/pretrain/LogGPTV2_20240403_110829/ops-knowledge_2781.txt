User: I have a bash script to automate few things I do. The bash calls 2 python scripts, If I run the bash script normally, everything runs, no errors what so ever. I set up a cron job to Automate this and when I checked the logs I noticed the python scripts don't run at all. It gives me the following error.
python: can't open file 'movefiles.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory
python: can't open file 'create_log_shimmer.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory

Both these files exist and runs when calling the bash script directly.
Assistant: The working directory of the cron is different from the directory you run the script directly.

Make your bash script to use absolute path for python script files.
Or make the bash script to change directory to where you run the script directly.
