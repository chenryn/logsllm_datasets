User: I'm new to computer programming!
I want to learn python and write my program and run it on my mac OS X machine.
How can i setup python programming tools on OS X and how can i use that ?
I before this never use any other programming language.
Assistant: python is installed on OSX by default
and you just need to open terminal and write ‘python’ command, then you can start your python coding
