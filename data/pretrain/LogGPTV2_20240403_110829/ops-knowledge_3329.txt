User: List common types of web security threats and provide corresponding security protection measures
Assistant: Common types of web security threats include: 1. SQL injection attacks: attackers inject malicious SQL codes to destroy database security, which can lead to data leakage, data tampering, and even system crashes. Protective measures: use parameterized queries, limit user input, use firewalls, etc. 2. Cross-site scripting (XSS): attackers inject malicious JavaScript scripts into web pages, which can steal user information and tamper with web pages. Protective measures: filter user input, properly escape user input, use httpOnly and secure flags, regularly update website defense measures, etc. 3. CSRF attack: Attackers use cross-site request forgery to allow users to perform malicious operations without knowing it, which can lead to data leakage and loss. Protective measures: use csrf Token, verify the source of the request, use verification codes, etc. 4. Information leakage: including user personal information leakage, database information leakage, server information leakage, etc. Protective measures: Strengthen user rights management, limit access to sensitive information, use security protocols to protect data transmission, and regularly back up important data, etc. 5. Denial of service attack (DDoS): Attackers use large-scale traffic attacks to prevent normal access to websites. Protective measures: use CDN distributed defense, use anti-DDoS equipment, upgrade firewall, set limit access frequency, etc. 6. Malicious file upload: Attackers upload malicious files to execute code on the server side, steal data or attack other systems. Protective measures: limit upload file type and size, set file upload path, limit execution permissions, etc. 7. Session hijacking: Attackers hijack user session IDs, pretend to be legitimate users, bypass user authentication, and cause information disclosure or misleading operations. Protective measures: adopt user authentication scheme, set cookie security flag, use https encryption, etc. 8. Click hijacking attack: The attacker uses iframe technology to hijack the user's click behavior without the user's knowledge, so as to achieve the purpose of deceiving the user. Protective measures: adopt X-Frame-Options option, set iframe not to be embedded, etc. The above are common types of web security threats and corresponding protection measures. In practical applications, it is necessary to comprehensively consider business characteristics and security risks, and adopt multi-level security defense measures to improve system security.
