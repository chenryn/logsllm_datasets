(b) Optimal threshold.
Fig. 4. Optimal short-term half-life (left) and optimal detection threshold (right) as a
function of the block size B and the foreign symbol saturation λa
Except for some noise at very low saturation values in the optimal short-term
half-life surface (Figure 4(a)), we notice that we get better convergence to an
optimal short-term half-life than to an optimal threshold as is evident from the
smoother appearance of the optimal short-term half-life surface compared to the
optimal threshold surface (Figure 4(b)). To investigate the cause of the poor
convergence of the threshold value, we generated a graph of cost as a function of
the detector tuning (Figure 5). This graph corresponds to the case in which the
block size B was 900 and the foreign-symbol saturation λa was 0.3. Two possible
explanations for the threshold convergence problem suggested by this graph are:
– Multiple minima – Notice that the minimum cost on the Hst = 15 curve
with a threshold value near 2.5, and the minimum cost the Hst = 25 curve
with a threshold value near 3.99 are nearly identical. In essence, relatively
small changes in the short-term half-life value can dramatically aﬀect the
optimal threshold. This suggests that small random perturbations can cause
one or the other of the two threshold values to be deemed optimal. As we
run experiments varying the block size and the saturation, these random
perturbations can cause the optimal short-term half life or threshold to jump
between the two local minima, resulting in the jagged appearance of the
optimal threshold surface.
– Low sensitivity – Notice also that even on the Hst = 15 curve, the cost value
is nearly ﬂat near the minimum point. Again this suggests that random
perturbations can cause the optimum point to jump, further contributing to
the diﬃculty in ﬁnding a stable optimal threshold.

Fig. 5. Eﬀect of detector tuning on error cost with B = 900 and λa = 0.3
Turning our attention back to the optimal short-term half-life surface shown
in Figure 4(a), we notice that there are three basic regions on this surface based
on the foreign-symbol saturation (λa) value:
– Low foreign-symbol saturation – In this region the normal and anomalous
blocks are so similar that even when optimally tuned, detector performance
is poor (see Figure 2). In this region, the cost as a function of the short-term
half-life is essentially ﬂat except for noise due to random variations in the
synthetic data. This results in the optimal short-term half-life being decided
by these random variations rather than by the eﬀects of the data or detector,
resulting in the jagged peaks and valleys.
– Medium foreign-symbol saturation – In this region the optimal short-term
half-life increases as the block size increases. This is due to the trade-oﬀ
between the accuracy that results from a larger short-term half-life (and thus
larger eﬀective sample size) and the block-boundary problem (discussed in
Section 6.1) that is exacerbated by larger short-term half-life values. As the
block size increases, the transition problem becomes less signiﬁcant, and thus
a larger short-term half-life becomes more eﬀective.
– High foreign-symbol saturation – In this region the foreign-symbol saturation
is so high that the anomalies can be easily detected even with a small sample.
Since there is no signiﬁcant beneﬁt to using a large sample (i.e., a large short-
term half-life) a smaller short-term half-life is preferred to minimize errors
due to block transitions.
6.3 Comparison with Real-World Data
To validate the signiﬁcance of the synthetic-data experiments, we compared
the results of an experiment using real-world data to results using synthetic
data. The real-world data was the sendmail system-call trace data collected by
researchers at the University of New Mexico [5]. The trace data consists of a
“normal” trace ﬁle and an “intruder” trace ﬁle. We ﬁrst created three 100,000-
symbol data sets, drawn from the ﬁrst 300,000 symbols of the normal trace

ﬁle (which contained 1,571,583 symbols); these data sets, each the same size
as those used in the synthetic data sets, were used to train the detector. We
next constructed the test data by splicing together alternating blocks of symbols
from the normal trace (starting at symbol 300,001, so as to avoid using the same
data for training and testing) and the intruder trace. We used the block-size
parameter B to vary block sizes in the same way in which we varied the block
sizes for the synthetic data. This gives us a trace based on real-world data that
is directly comparable to our synthetic-data experiments.
Figure 6(a) shows the detector error cost for the real-world data as a function
of the block size and the detector short-term half-life. The threshold is assumed
to be optimally tuned. Figure 6(b) shows the corresponding graph for synthetic
data with foreign symbol injections at a saturation of λa = 0.5. With a few
small diﬀerences, the basic shape of the two graphs is very similar. The two
most obvious diﬀerences are:
– In the experiment with real-world data, the error cost falls oﬀ almost imme-
diately as the block size increases, whereas in the synthetic-data experiment
the error cost remains constant until the block size is moderately large.
– The optimal cost for the synthetic-data experiment is lower than that for
the real-world data experiment.
While injection type (foreign, rare or uncommon) and saturation do aﬀect the
details of the cost surface shape, the same basic features are generally preserved.
Typically, lower saturation values result in a cost surface that slopes down more
gradually from the small-blocksize/high-short-term-half-life corner, and has a
124

larger lip on the low-short-term-half-life edge of the curve. Furthermore, other
parameters that were not studied in detail in this paper (e.g., alphabet size and
symbol-type distribution standard deviation σ), would also be expected to have
an eﬀect. Given that changing the data characteristics can result in a variety of
similar cost curves, we believe that our sendmail trace results are well within
the scope of our expectations.
7 Conclusion
In this paper we presented an evaluation approach for an anomaly-based detec-
tor, using a parameterized family of synthetic data sets. We varied the injection
type and saturation level, as well as the block size (via injection length and time
between injections). We also validated our observed performance characteristics
on the synthetic data by comparing it with a real-world data set, noting that we
obtained similar performance curves.
We observed a relationship between the block size and the optimal short-
term half life. We showed that as the block size decreased we needed to decrease
the short-term half-life in order to maintain optimal performance. This suggests
that when placed in an environment where attacks are expected to be short or
frequent, the short-term half life should be small. Since the short-term half life
essentially sets a short-term window, we could also expect similar results for
other detectors that have a window-size parameter. An exception to this rule
is that when an intruder manifests as an obvious and easy-to-detect anomaly
(e.g., has a high saturation value), or conversely, is on the margin of the de-
tector’s discriminatory capability, larger short-term half-life values should be
used.
We have evaluated RIDES over a wide range of data environments. The lessons
