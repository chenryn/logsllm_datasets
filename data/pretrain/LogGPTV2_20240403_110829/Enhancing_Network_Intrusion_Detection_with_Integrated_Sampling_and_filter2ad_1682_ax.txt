**Figure 4** illustrates the optimal short-term half-life (left) and the optimal detection threshold (right) as functions of the block size \( B \) and the foreign symbol saturation \( \lambda_a \).

#### Observations:
- The optimal short-term half-life surface (Figure 4(a)) shows better convergence compared to the optimal threshold surface (Figure 4(b)), as evidenced by its smoother appearance.
- At very low saturation values, some noise is observed in the optimal short-term half-life surface.

To investigate the poor convergence of the threshold value, we generated a graph of cost as a function of the detector tuning (Figure 5). This graph corresponds to a block size \( B = 900 \) and a foreign-symbol saturation \( \lambda_a = 0.3 \).

**Possible Explanations for Poor Convergence:**
1. **Multiple Minima:**
   - The minimum cost on the \( H_{st} = 15 \) curve with a threshold value near 2.5 and the minimum cost on the \( H_{st} = 25 \) curve with a threshold value near 3.99 are nearly identical.
   - Small changes in the short-term half-life can significantly affect the optimal threshold, leading to random perturbations that cause the optimal threshold to jump between local minima, resulting in a jagged appearance of the optimal threshold surface.

2. **Low Sensitivity:**
   - Even on the \( H_{st} = 15 \) curve, the cost value is nearly flat near the minimum point.
   - Random perturbations can cause the optimal point to jump, further contributing to the difficulty in finding a stable optimal threshold.

### Analysis of Optimal Short-Term Half-Life Surface (Figure 4(a))

The optimal short-term half-life surface can be divided into three regions based on the foreign-symbol saturation \( \lambda_a \):

1. **Low Foreign-Symbol Saturation:**
   - In this region, normal and anomalous blocks are very similar, leading to poor detector performance even when optimally tuned.
   - The cost as a function of the short-term half-life is essentially flat, except for noise due to random variations in the synthetic data.
   - This results in the optimal short-term half-life being decided by these random variations rather than the data or detector, causing jagged peaks and valleys.

2. **Medium Foreign-Symbol Saturation:**
   - The optimal short-term half-life increases as the block size increases.
   - This is due to the trade-off between the accuracy from a larger short-term half-life (larger effective sample size) and the block-boundary problem, which is exacerbated by larger short-term half-life values.
   - As the block size increases, the transition problem becomes less significant, making a larger short-term half-life more effective.

3. **High Foreign-Symbol Saturation:**
   - Anomalies can be easily detected even with a small sample.
   - There is no significant benefit to using a large sample, so a smaller short-term half-life is preferred to minimize errors due to block transitions.

### Comparison with Real-World Data

To validate the significance of the synthetic-data experiments, we compared the results with real-world data. The real-world data used was the sendmail system-call trace data collected by researchers at the University of New Mexico [5].

**Real-World Data Experiment:**
- Three 100,000-symbol data sets were created from the first 300,000 symbols of the normal trace file.
- Test data was constructed by splicing alternating blocks of symbols from the normal and intruder traces, starting at symbol 300,001 to avoid using the same data for training and testing.
- The block-size parameter \( B \) was varied similarly to the synthetic data experiments.

**Figure 6:**
- **(a) Cost function for real-world data (sendmail trace).**
- **(b) Cost function for synthetic data with foreign-symbol injection of \( \lambda_a = 0.5 \)**

**Observations:**
- The basic shape of the graphs for real-world and synthetic data is very similar, with a few differences:
  - For real-world data, the error cost falls off almost immediately as the block size increases.
  - For synthetic data, the error cost remains constant until the block size is moderately large.
  - The optimal cost for the synthetic-data experiment is lower than that for the real-world data experiment.

**Conclusion:**
- Injection type and saturation level do affect the details of the cost surface shape, but the basic features are generally preserved.
- Other parameters such as alphabet size and symbol-type distribution standard deviation \( \sigma \) would also have an effect.
- Given the variety of similar cost curves, our sendmail trace results are well within the scope of our expectations.

### Conclusion

In this paper, we presented an evaluation approach for an anomaly-based detector using a parameterized family of synthetic data sets. We varied the injection type, saturation level, and block size, and validated our observations with real-world data. We observed a relationship between the block size and the optimal short-term half-life, suggesting that a smaller short-term half-life should be used in environments where attacks are expected to be short or frequent. Larger short-term half-life values are preferred for obvious and easy-to-detect anomalies or when the intruder is on the margin of the detector's discriminatory capability. Our evaluation of RIDES over a wide range of data environments provides valuable insights for detector tuning.
