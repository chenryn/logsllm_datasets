ATT&CK Technique Name:Email Accounts
Adversaries may compromise email accounts that can be used during targeting. Adversaries can use compromised email accounts to further their operations, such as leveraging them to conduct Phishing for Information, Phishing, or large-scale spam email campaigns.

Compromised email accounts can also be used in the acquisition of infrastructure (ex: Domains).
