victim V across the routers R1 to R5. Each router uses the TTL value of the packet to index
into the IP identiﬁcation ﬁeld to insert its marking. In this example we show a 1-bit marking in
a 4-bit ﬁeld for simplicity.
P = Pi mark of the packet
n = number of bits each router marks
Pimark(P, TTL, Curr IP, n)
{
m = 2n − 1;
b = markingbits(Curr IP ) & m;
bitpos = (TTL mod (cid:9) 16
b  3) would not provide sufﬁcient
detail to differentiate attack and legitimate users’ pack-
ets. The reason that we eliminated n = 3 was that the
entire IP Identiﬁcation ﬁeld would not be used since 3 is
not an integer divisor of 16. The loss of one bit may not
seem signiﬁcant, but it would limit our marking space to
215 = 32768 possible markings. This limitation would
make the effects of marking saturation more severe than
they otherwise would be, so we eliminated n = 3 as an
option as well. It is important to note that the number of
bits per router marking n, must be a globally imposed
constant in a deployed Pi system. We chose n = 1 and
n = 2 based on the Skitter [5] and Internet Map [14, 3]
data sets. It is possible that the real Internet topology
may be substantially different from this sample data, in
which case our choices will have to be revisited.
