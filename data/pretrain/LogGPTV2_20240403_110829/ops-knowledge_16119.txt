User: Please describe virtualization technology, how to use virtualization technology to achieve high availability, and the impact of virtualization technology on the entire IT architecture.
Assistant: Virtualization technology is a technology that abstracts computer resources (including processors, memory, storage, and networks). Through this technology, a physical computer (host) can be divided into multiple virtual machines (VMs) for Operate independently. This technology can improve the utilization of computer resources, reduce hardware costs, and improve the manageability and scalability of IT infrastructure. Highly available applications can be achieved through virtualization technology. A common technique is to deploy an application in multiple virtual machine instances and automatically transfer the load to another instance in the event of a failure. In this way, the automatic failover of the system can be realized, and the stability and availability of the system can be improved. The impact of virtualization technology on the entire IT architecture is very large. First, it reduces hardware costs and increases computer resource utilization and profitability. Secondly, virtualization technology can improve the manageability and scalability of IT infrastructure, because it can manage multiple virtual machines under one management platform for unified management, monitoring and maintenance. Again, virtualization technology can provide enterprises with more flexible deployment and operation methods. For example, applications can be deployed in the enterprise's own data center or on the platform of a public cloud service provider. In short, virtualization technology has broad application prospects and market prospects, and has become one of the core technologies of the current IT infrastructure.
