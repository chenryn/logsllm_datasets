**Title: BlackHat US-20: Exploiting Excel Online - A Deep Dive into CVE-2018-8331**

The Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) plays a critical role in monitoring and addressing exploits in the wild. While we have observed numerous cases of exploits targeting Office applications, particularly PowerPoint and Word, attacks on online applications are relatively rare. This raises several questions: Are such attacks even possible? If so, how would one go about attacking the Office Web Application (OWA) server? Can a malicious document be used to exploit these vulnerabilities? How complex and time-consuming would such an attack be?

This presentation delves into a project conducted during the summer of 2018, aimed at answering these questions by focusing on Excel Online. Specifically, it details an integer overflow vulnerability found in the `fnConcatenate` formula (CVE-2018-8331) and demonstrates how chaining Excel formulas can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server. The talk will cover the entire research process, from initial discovery to a live demonstration of the exploit against Excel OnPrem.

### Key Points:
- **Vulnerability Overview**: An in-depth look at the integer overflow vulnerability in the `fnConcatenate` formula.
- **Exploit Development**: Techniques for chaining Excel formulas to achieve RCE.
- **Research Process**: A step-by-step account of the research, including challenges and breakthroughs.
- **Live Demonstration**: A practical demo of the exploit in action against Excel OnPrem.

This session is designed to provide valuable insights into the security landscape of online Office applications and the potential risks they face.
