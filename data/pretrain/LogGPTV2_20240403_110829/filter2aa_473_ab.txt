Integrity Karma
Even if they don't feel better today...
Even if you missed that call that time...
Even if you don't know what to say sometimes...
Even if you don't know what to say sometimes...
If they know you care, friends 
(and sometimes strangers!) 
will reach out to you when it counts.

Active Listening is not Social Engineering

misunderstood. Does that sound right?
PIC: Yeah.
Responder: Have you ever told anyone else you 
feel that way?OR When you feel like that, what do 
you usually do?
Responder: No worries, I have some time to talk. But first I 
want to make sure you're safe now. Did you hurt yourself at all 
tonight?
PIC: No. I thought about it but not yet.Responder: That's good 
to hear. Are you drinking or did you take anything?
PIC: I had a few beers.
Responder: Ok, thanks for telling me. Do you think  you can 
hold off on drinking any more while we talk?
PIC: Yeah, sure.
Responder: I appreciate it, it's easier for us to focus that way. 
You said before you didn't hurt yourself "yet" ... 
Can you tell me more about what you meant by that?

and I won't always feel this way in the future.
I can't change what happened,

Identifying Root Feelings
•
"I am so burnt out." 
•
"I feel exhausted from working all the time and going home just stresses me out more."
•
•
"I feel exhausted from working all the time and angry that I have to be on call 24/7 just to get an 
ounce of recognition from my boss, and the attitude I take home isn't making my family life any 
better. And this new guy at work is eyeing my stapler, that bastard."
•
"That new guy seems pretty good, and I'm terrified he's going to replace me if I can't prove to 
everyone that I'm on his level. But what if Itry to learn the new stuff, I'll find out I'm not as fast at it 
as I used to be? My family would be so disappointed in me if they knew. I've been shutting them 
out, and now I feel guilty that it's gone on for so long that I can't bring it up and admit this is all 
my fault. I think about home when I'm at work, and work when I'm at home, and get nothing 
constructive done at either."

Resources
You!
Talking to someone trusted who is educated about suicide intervention can 
save a life. If possible, talk in person. While implementing QPR, you can 
research alternate referral options and help get the PIC to a safe space. 
911
If you think/know an attempt is in progress, call Emergency Services 
911
If you think/know an attempt is in progress, call Emergency Services 
immediately.
Current or Past Therapist
Professionals with knowledge of the PIC's medical / psychological history are 
invaluable. Past therapists can help make quality referrals (e.g. after a move or 
due to insurance change). If the PIC won't make the call, you can.
Hospital / Counseling Center
Making the physical move to safe environment drastically lowers mortality risk.
