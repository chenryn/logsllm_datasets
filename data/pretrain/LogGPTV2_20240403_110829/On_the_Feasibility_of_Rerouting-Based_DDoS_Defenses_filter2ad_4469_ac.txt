### Analysis of Detour Path Length and AS Poisoning

**Figure 5: Number of ASes to be poisoned for the selected 1,000 detour paths.**

- The number of ASes that need to be poisoned is substantial. The maximum number of ASes to be poisoned is 10,846.
- In most cases, more than a thousand ASes need to be poisoned.
- Only less than 5% of cases have fewer than 255 ASes to be poisoned.

**Figure 6: Relationship between the detour path length and the number of ASes to be poisoned.**

- The box-and-whisker plots in Figure 6 show the distribution of detour path lengths. Each plot includes two vertical dashed lines representing the first and fourth quartiles, with the whiskers indicating the minimum and maximum values. The red band inside the blue box represents the median.
- A counter-intuitive relationship is observed: as the detour path length increases, the number of ASes to be poisoned tends to decrease. For example, the median value decreases from approximately 2,000 ASes for 4-hop detour paths to about 200 ASes for 13-hop detour paths.

**Figure 7: Average number of Tier-1 and Tier-2 ASes in different detour path length groups.**

- To understand this counter-intuitive result, we analyzed the characteristics of ASes on the detour paths based on their tier (Tier-1, Tier-2, Tier-3).
- **Figure 7(a):** Detour paths with shorter lengths (e.g., 4-7 hops) are more likely to include a Tier-1 AS, with an average of 0.7-0.8 Tier-1 ASes per detour path. This drops to around 0.4 per detour path for longer detours (more than 8 hops).
- **Figure 7(b):** Tier-2 ASes are the majority type in detour paths, and their relative proportion increases with the detour path length.

**Figure 8: Distribution of the number of neighbor ASes to be poisoned for the 1,000 selected detour paths, classified by their AS type.**

- Figure 8 shows that 80% of Tier-1 ASes have relationships with more than 100 ASes, and 40% have more than 1,000 neighbors.
- Including one or more Tier-1 ASes on the detour path typically results in the RAC defense needing to poison hundreds to thousands of neighboring ASes to prevent them from receiving poisoned messages.

**BGP-4 Specification and Maximum AS Path Length**

- The BGP-4 specification (RFC 4271) defines a maximum packet size limit of 4,096 bytes for a single BGP UPDATE message, allowing up to 2,034 ASes in its AS-PATH field.
- By exploiting these 2,034 AS number fields, one can poison all the ASes that need to be avoided for isolated detour paths for the majority (e.g., 80%) of the tested 1,000 C–D pairs, as shown in Figure 5.

### Requirements for Guaranteed Detour Path Establishment

To ensure a detour path is established, the RAC deployer (i.e., the destination AS) must ensure that BGP poisoning messages are propagated by all ASes on the detour path without being filtered out. Although the BGP specification supports long AS paths, there is reasonable doubt that some ASes would filter UPDATE messages with such long AS paths.

**Active Measurement**

- An ideal large-scale active measurement would involve sending probe BGP UPDATE messages with different AS path lengths (e.g., 10s, 100s, 1000s, or longer) and monitoring their propagation.
- However, such a large-scale collaborative BGP testbed does not currently exist.
- Small-scale active measurements at PEERING Research Testbed and an academic institution were attempted but failed due to configuration limits and concerns about router crashes.

**Passive Measurement**

- A passive measurement study was conducted using the RIPE BGP repositories, which collected 37 billion BGP UPDATE messages from January 1 to June 30, 2018.
- The main contribution to excessively long BGP messages (≥ 30) is AS prepending, where the origin AS number is repeated multiple times.
- Figure 9 shows the AS path length distribution, revealing a sharp decrease in the occurrence of UPDATE messages at around an AS path length of 255.
- Conjectured BGP message filtering practices:
  - Some ASes filter messages with path lengths in [30,75).
  - No ASes filter messages with path lengths in [75,255).
  - The majority of ASes filter messages with path lengths ≥ 255.

These findings align with best current practices suggested by IETF, equipment vendors, and network operator communities, which recommend inbound filtering based on AS path lengths of 40, 50, and 75.
