of the RAC defense.1
Figure 5 shows that the number of ASes to be poisoned is
tremendous: the maximum number of ASes to be poisoned is
10,846; the majority of cases have more than a thousand of
ASes to be poisoned; and only less than 5% of cases have less
than 255 ASes to be poisoned.
Reasons behind the large number of ASes to be poisoned.
Let us investigate why the isolated detour paths require large
numbers (e.g., few hundreds to thousands) of ASes to be
poisoned. We ﬁrst look at the relationship between the length
of a detour path and the number of ASes to be poisoned. The
box-and-whisker plots in Figure 6 show the distribution of
detour path length where each of them contains 2 vertical dash
lines representing the ﬁrst and the fourth quartile of the data
set and the ends of the whisker describe the minimum and
maximum value. The red band inside the blue box separates
the second and the third quartile and represents the median of
the data set. Figure 6 shows a counter-intuitive relationship;
i.e., the number of ASes to be poisoned tends to decrease
as the detour path length increases. For example, the median
value decreases gradually from approximately 2,000 ASes with
the 4-hop detour paths to only about 200 ASes with 13-hop
detour paths.
To better understand this counter-intuitive result, we further
analyze the characteristics of ASes on the detour paths in
different detour path lengths. In Figure 7, we calculate the
average number of Tier-1 and Tier-2 ASes that appear in
each detour path and show the results in each set of detour
paths grouped by their length. We categorize the ASes on the
selected detour paths based on their tier, following the widely

hops, geographic distance) for choosing one detour path.

accepted classiﬁcation [56].2 Figure 7(a) shows that the detour
paths with shorter length (e.g., 4-7) are more likely to include
a Tier-1 AS, indicated by the average number of Tier-1 ASes
is around 0.7 − 0.8 per detour path when the detours are 4 − 7
hops but suddenly drops to around 0.4 per detour path when
the detour is longer than 8 hops. On the contrary, Figure 7(b)
shows that Tier-2 ASes are the majority type in the detour
paths and their relative proportion is increasing as the AS path
length.
Figure 6 and Figure 7(a) indicate that the number of Tier-
1 ASes on detour paths has a signiﬁcant impact on the total
number of ASes to be poisoned. We conﬁrm this ﬁnding by
showing the distribution of the number of neighbors of the
ASes on the detour path classiﬁed by their tiers in Figure 8.
Each line represents a group of classiﬁed ASes and its CDF
of number of neighboring ASes. Figure 8 shows that 80%
Tier-1 ASes have relationship with more than 100 ASes and
40% Tier-1 ASes have more than 1,000 neighbors. Thus,
including one or more Tier-1 ASes on the detour path usually
causes the RAC defense to poison hundreds to thousands of
neighbors of these ASes in order to prevent any of them
from receiving poisoned messages. We present an additional
supporting measurement data in Appendix A, where we show
the vast majority of all possible detour paths include at least
one or more Tier-1 ASes.

message. Considering the header and necessary ﬁelds, one
BGP UPDATE message may include up to 2,034 ASes in
its AS-PATH ﬁeld. By exploiting these maximum 2,034 AS
number ﬁelds, one can poison all the ASes that need to be
avoided for isolated detour path for the majority (e.g., 80%)
of the tested 1,000 C–D pairs; see Figure 5.
B. Requirements for Guaranteed Detour Path Establishment
To guarantee that a detour path will be established, the
RAC deployer (i.e., the destination AS) must ensure that its
BGP poisoning messages are propagated by all
the ASes
on the detour path from D to C (e.g., D, Z, Y , X, C in
Figure 2) without getting ﬁltered out on the way. Although the
BGP speciﬁcation supports excessively long AS path in BGP
UPDATE messages (e.g., up to 2,034), we have reasonable
doubt that in practice some ASes would ﬁlter UPDATE mes-
sages with such long AS paths; see the complaints in NANOG
community regarding long AS paths [29], [38], the best current
practice of BGP operations [21], and Cisco routers’ default
ﬁltering based on AS path length [46].
In this section, we investigate how the ASes in the current
Internet handle excessively long AS paths in BGP UPDATE
messages. We describe two approaches to this investigation:
active and passive measurements of the BGP UPDATE mes-
sage ﬁltering behaviors.
Active measurement. A large-scale active measurement is an
ideal measurement on how the AS path length affects the
acceptance of BGP poisoning messages in the current Internet.
This would require a large number of ASes to send probe BGP
UPDATE messages with different AS path length (e.g., 10s,
100s, 1000s, or longer). Then, we would monitor if these BGP
messages are propagated to various geographically distributed
vantage points without getting dropped on the way. This ideal
experiment would provide a highly accurate estimation of
actual BGP message treatment based on the AS path length.
However, to the authors’ best knowledge, such a large-scale,
collaborative BGP testbed does not exist, unfortunately.
We also have tried a small-scale active measurement at
two different networks where we can announce customized
BGP messages; however, we have learned that even small-
scale active tests are nearly impossible in the current Internet.
Our ﬁrst testing network, PEERING Research Testbed [10],
does not allow BGP UPDATE messages with AS path length
longer than 10. Our second testing network is one of our
academic institutions and it also refuses to experiment with
BGP UPDATE messages with AS path length longer than 30.
In both cases, we have found two common reasons for refusing
our experiment requests: (1) abnormally long AS path length
cannot even be conﬁgured in their BGP routers; and, perhaps
more interestingly, (2) the two institutions have explicitly
expressed their concern that any abnormal BGP messages
may crash their routers and their upstream routers. Our failed
attempts for active measurements nevertheless strengthen our
doubt that BGP messages with excessively long AS path would
be ﬁltered out by many ASes.
Passive measurement. We instead perform a passive measure-
ment study of the public BGP UPDATE database, particularly
RIPE BGP repositories [12], collected during the six-month
period from January 1 to June 30, 2018. This dataset contains

AS-PATH Length (PL)
Figure 9: AS path length distribution of 37 billion BGP
UPDATE messages collected during a six-month period from
Jan 1 to June 30, 2018. At around the AS path length of 255,
a sharp (∼ 50 times) decrease of the occurrence of UPDATE
messages is observed. Pr[·] denotes the empirical probability
distribution of the path lengths.
the UPDATE messages sent from all origin ASes in the Inter-
net to 364 globally distributed vantage points (i.e., the peering
members of the 24 RIPE collectors), offering a great view of
the UPDATE messages that have been successfully delivered
across the globe. Note that, however, we do not conduct
controlled experiments (e.g., testing different AS path lengths
from selected ASes) in this purely passive measurement study
and thus it lacks the ground truth of all the generated BGP
UPDATE messages during the observation period.
In our longitudinal analysis of 37 billion BGP UPDATE
messages, we observe that the main contribution to the ex-
cessively long (e.g., ≥ 30) BGP messages is the well-known
AS prepending; i.e., the origin AS number is repeated mul-
tiple times when the UPDATE message is ﬁrst crafted. The
following example shows a typical AS prepending pattern.
• Preﬁx: 2a0b:3c47:cabb::/48
• AS-PATH: {12307, 57118, 196621, 15576, 174, 136620, 204816, 137875,
137875, 137875, 137875, 137875, 137875, 137875, 137875, 137875, · · ·
(137875 skipped 500 times), · · · 137875, 137875, 137875, 137875}
In this example, the origin AS 137875 repeats its own AS
number more than 500 times before sending the UPDATE
message to its neighboring ASes. Such pointless long AS
paths in the UPDATE messages have been criticized by
network operator communities for being ignorant and causing
computation and space costs to the ASes that have to process
them [29], [38].
Moreover, we also ﬁnd a multifaceted evidence that the
majority of the ASes in the current Internet do ﬁlter UPDATE
messages with extremely long AS paths at a speciﬁc AS path
length. Figure 9 shows the AS path length distribution of all
the 37 billion BGP UPDATE messages. We plot the number
of UPDATE messages for each AS path length (see both X-
axis and Y-axis are in log scale) from 1 to 520 (the longest
AS path observed during the period). We focus only on the
rare, abnormal cases (which amount to only 0.01%) where
path length is ≥ 30.
Abnormal cases (path length ≥ 30). Only less than 0.01%
of UPDATE messages have AS paths longer than 30 and
how these abnormal messages are handled provides useful
insights as to how the ASes ﬁlter such long AS-path messages.

From the distribution of abnormal UPDATE messages found
in Figure 9, we have three observations:
x Reduction of longer messages in the range [30,75).
y No reduction of messages in the range [75,255).
z Sudden reduction of messages at around path length of 255.
Note that we cannot directly measure how ASes ﬁlter long
AS-path messages because we do not control or even know
how many BGP messages with speciﬁc AS-path length have
been generated in this passive measurement study. Yet, from
the above observations we conjecture the following highly
feasible BGP message ﬁltering practices based on the AS-path
length:
 Some ASes ﬁlter messages with path length in [30,75).
 No ASes ﬁlter messages with path length in [75,255).
 Majority of ASes ﬁlter messages with path length ≥ 255.
We conﬁrm that the conjectured ﬁltering practices are well
aligned with the several independent, anecdotal evidence of
BGP message ﬁltering practices:
(1) The BGP’s best current practice suggested by the IETF,
equipment vendors (e.g., Cisco), and network operator
communities (e.g., NANOG) encourages BGP UPDATE
inbound ﬁltering based on the AS path length of 40 [42],
50 [55], and 75 [22]. The ad hoc implementation of these
best common practices appears to be well aligned with our
observation x and the conjecture .
