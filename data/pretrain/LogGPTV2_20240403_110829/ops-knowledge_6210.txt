User: For example, I have two python file test1.py and test2.py. At first, test1.py will run. And I want test2.py to be run when the test1.py is finished. 
I want the two python files run in different shell. That means test1.py should be closed when it is finished.
All the help is appreciated! Thank you!

I want this task to be some kind of scheduler task. At 12:00 pm the test1.py is executed. And after test1.py is finished, I want to execute test2.py automatically
Assistant: The easiest way is going to be to do this in the shell, not using pure python. Just run python test1.py && python test2.py or python test1.py; python test2.py. 
The one with && won't run test2.py if test1 fails while the one using ; will run both regardless.
