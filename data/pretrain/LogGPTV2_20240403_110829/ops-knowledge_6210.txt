**User:**

I have two Python files, `test1.py` and `test2.py`. I want `test1.py` to run first, and once it has completed, I want `test2.py` to run. Additionally, I need these scripts to run in separate shell sessions, meaning that `test1.py` should be closed when it finishes.

Furthermore, I would like this to be a scheduled task. Specifically, I want `test1.py` to start at 12:00 PM, and after it completes, `test2.py` should automatically execute.

Any help with this would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

**Assistant:**

To achieve this, the simplest approach is to use shell commands rather than pure Python. You can schedule the execution of `test1.py` and `test2.py` using a combination of shell commands and a scheduler like `cron` (on Unix-like systems) or Task Scheduler (on Windows).

### Using Shell Commands

You can create a shell script to run both Python files sequentially. Here’s an example:

```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Run test1.py
python3 test1.py

# Check if test1.py was successful
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    # If test1.py succeeded, run test2.py
    python3 test2.py
else
    echo "test1.py failed, not running test2.py"
fi
```

Save this script as `run_scripts.sh` and make it executable:

```sh
chmod +x run_scripts.sh
```

### Scheduling the Task

#### On Unix-like Systems (Linux, macOS)

You can use `cron` to schedule the task. Open the crontab editor:

```sh
crontab -e
```

Add the following line to schedule the script to run at 12:00 PM every day:

```sh
0 12 * * * /path/to/run_scripts.sh
```

#### On Windows

You can use the Task Scheduler to run the script. Follow these steps:

1. Open Task Scheduler.
2. Create a new task.
3. Set the trigger to run daily at 12:00 PM.
4. Set the action to start a program, and specify the path to your shell script (e.g., `C:\path\to\run_scripts.bat`).

### Explanation

- The shell script `run_scripts.sh` runs `test1.py` and checks its exit status.
- If `test1.py` exits successfully (exit code 0), `test2.py` will be executed.
- If `test1.py` fails, `test2.py` will not be executed, and an error message will be printed.

This setup ensures that `test1.py` and `test2.py` run in separate shell sessions and that `test2.py` only runs if `test1.py` completes successfully.
