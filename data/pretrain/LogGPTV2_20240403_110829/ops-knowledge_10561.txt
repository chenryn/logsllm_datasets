User: I installed both Python 2.7 and Python 2.6.5. I don't know what went wrong, but nothing related to Python seems to work any more. e.g. "setup.py install" for certain packages don't recognize the "install" parameter and other odd phenomena...
I would like to completely remove Python from my system.
I tried running the 2.7 and 2.6 msi files and choosing remove Python and then running only 2.6 and reinstalling it. Still stuff don't work.
How do I completely remove Python - from everything? (!)
I would not like to reinstall my entire machine just because of the Python install...
Assistant: I had window 7 (64 bit) and Python 2.7.12, 
I uninstalled it by clicking the python installer from the "download" directory then  I selected remove python then I clicked “ finish”.
I also removed the remaining python associated directory & files from the c: drive and also from “my documents” folder, since I created some files there.
