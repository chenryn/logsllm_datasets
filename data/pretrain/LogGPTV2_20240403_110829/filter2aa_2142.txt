## Introduction

### Why Do We Use Locks?
Locks are essential for maintaining the security and safety of our belongings. While a heavy steel door or a brick wall can effectively secure a room, they are impractical in many situations. Locks provide a balance between security and convenience, allowing us to protect our valuables without the need for massive, cumbersome installations.

### The Balance of Security and Convenience
- **High-Security Doors:** Banks and military installations, such as NORAD, use heavy-duty doors that are extremely secure but also very expensive and difficult to install and operate.
- **Standard Padlocks:** These are easy to use and quick to open, but they can be easily bypassed with simple tools like shims or bolt cutters.

Popular high-security locks aim to bridge this gap by offering strong security without the need for extensive hardware or high installation costs.
