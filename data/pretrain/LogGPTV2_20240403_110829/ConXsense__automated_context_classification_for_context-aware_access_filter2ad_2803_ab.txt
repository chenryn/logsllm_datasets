4.1 Survey Results
Risk of device misuse. As can be seen in Table 1, the ma-
jority of people (94% and 55%, respectively) perceive “home”
and “work” as having a low risk of misuse. This is explained
by answers to open-ended questions, like “(. . .) places like
home or oﬃce tend to remain secure regardless of time of
day”, supporting the intuition that familiar places are com-
monly perceived as having a low risk of misuse. While it is
not surprising that “home” is perceived as safe, perceptions
of “work” are more diverse [10], as reﬂected in our survey
results. A signiﬁcant fraction of people perceive “work” as a
context with high risk of misuse. The reasons for this are in-
dicated in several answers to the open-ended questions, e.g.,
“At work there are people around that I don’t know and I
don’t trust them.” This suggests that the familiarity of the
context alone is not a suﬃcient indicator for estimating the
risk level, also the people in context play an important role.
From Table 2 we can see that the people present in the
context clearly aﬀect the perceived risk of device misuse in
that context. A clear majority of respondents stated that a
low or high risk of device misuse is dependent on the persons
present. From the responses to open-ended questions, we
identiﬁed that the feeling of low risk is particularly caused
by people that are familiar to the user (e.g., “I trust my
friends and colleagues”). Similarly, the presence of unfa-
miliar persons in the context was indicated as a reason for
perceiving the context as having a high risk of device misuse
(e.g., “Where there are people around me that I don’t know,
I don’t feel secure”, or “Unknown people represent threat”).
This underlines the fact that location information alone
is not a suﬃcient basis for access control decisions. Also
other context information aﬀecting the perceptions of secu-
rity need to be taken into account.
Privacy exposure. The data in Table 1 suggest that a
signiﬁcant fraction of respondents feel that a familiar con-
text also has high privacy exposure, i.e., contains private or
conﬁdential context information related to the user.
Table 2 shows, however, that the perception of privacy
exposure does not appear to be aﬀected by the presence of
people. More respondents believe that the people present in
the context do not contribute to the level of privacy exposure
of the context.
Conclusions and Discussion. Based on the analysis of
the survey results above, we see that two main factors aﬀect
users’ perceptions on privacy exposure and risk of misuse in
contexts: the familiarity of the context itself and the famil-
iarity of persons present in the context. Therefore, we need
295to design our context model in a way that we can (1) identify
relevant contexts and model their familiarity, and, (2) track
encounters with other persons and measure their familiarity
by observing their mobile devices. In Section 6 we construct
such a context model.
The analysis presented above supports our common un-
derstanding and shows which factors typically inﬂuence the
perception of contexts. However, exceptions exist, like, e.g.,
those 4% who consider home a high-risk environment. Rea-
sons for this can be various. Answers to open-ended ques-
tions suggest that even in familiar contexts the perception
of risk of misuse changes when untrusted people appear, or,
it is caused by what we call the “Toddler Scenario”, i.e., the
inﬂuence of familiar people (e.g., a young child, or spouse)
considered as “clueless” or “honest but curious”, causing a
person to consider the risk of device misuse signiﬁcant also
in familiar surroundings. To investigate these special cases,
more detailed questions on familiar contexts would need to
be included. However, sociological literature suggests that
questions about such contexts are perceived as intrusive and
will therefore not be answered [4, 10]. This concern was also
reﬂected in some of the feedback we received about the on-
line questionnaire. Hence, and because exceptional cases
seem to be a marginal phenomenon, we focus on the com-
mon cases and address more exceptional cases in subsequent
studies.
5. USE CASES
Based on the user survey, we focus on the most prominent
concerns expressed by the users: fear of device misuse and
disclosure of private or conﬁdential context information. To
mitigate these concerns, we identiﬁed following use cases.
5.1 Misuse Protection: Usable Device Lock
Several surveys [9, 38] point out that many mobile users
do not use device locks (also known as idle screen locks) to
protect their phones even though that would eﬀectively pro-
tect against device misuse. One reason for this is that screen
locks and other similar access control techniques on mobile
devices today are both too inﬂexible and hard to use. A so-
lution could be to make the locking mechanism more usable,
so that users would be more willing to use device locking.
The approach taken by Gupta et al. [17] was to use context
data to adapt the locking time out of the device lock in dif-
ferent contexts. We adopt this approach and want to use
the estimated risk of device misuse in a context as a means
to decide, whether and how fast to lock the device in case it
is not used.
Adversary model. For this use case, the adversary is a
person in the context with physical access to the device. The
person may be malicious (a thief) or honest-but-curious (a
colleague or sibling) or “clueless” (a small child).
Goal. We want to protect the applications and data on the
device from potential threats in the context by limiting the
potential damage arising from someone physically accessing
the device without the user’s approval. Therefore, we want
to minimize the chances that an unauthorized person in the
context has access to the user’s data. We do this by conﬁg-
uring the device lock dynamically based on the risk of device
misuse in the context, while trying to strike a balance be-
tween maximizing protection on one hand and minimizing
user annoyance of having to unlock the device in low-risk
contexts on the other hand.
5.2 Resisting Sensory Malware
Sensory malware is an emerging class of malicious appli-
cations (typically Trojans) that use the context sensors of
a mobile device to collect potentially sensitive information
from the user’s context. Prominent examples of sensory
malware are Stealthy Video Capturer [44] (video via cam-
era), (sp)iPhone [25] (keystrokes via accelerometer) Sound-
comber [36] (spoken secrets via microphone), or the recent
PlaceRaider [42] Trojan (3D models via camera). Users may
also have granted sensor access privileges to benign apps
which use them too intrusively: for instance an augmented
reality app may take pictures of surroundings even when the
user is not actively using augmented reality, as a means of
enriching the app vendor’s data collection.
Adversary Model. For this use case, the adversary is an
app already installed on the device. We assume that the
application has been granted the necessary privileges during
installation and has therefore access to the contextual sen-
sors on the mobile device, but cannot circumvent the access
control system1. The application may be a Trojan Horse
(e.g., sensory malware) or a benign but somewhat intrusive
application.
Goal. We aim at protecting sensitive information in the
context of the device from the adversary. We do this by
preventing or limiting the ability of the adversary to gather
information from contexts with high privacy exposure, i.e.,
contexts that contain information that the user would want
to protect from the adversary. Such information can be ei-
ther private, i.e., information about the user herself, or, con-
ﬁdential, i.e., other sensitive information not directly related
to the user. The user’s home (private) and workplace (con-
ﬁdential) are examples of typical contexts with high privacy
exposure.
6. CONTEXT MODEL
In this section, we present a context model used to ex-
tract context features reﬂecting the familiarity of contexts
and the persons in the context. The context features are
input for the Classiﬁer and used for classifying contexts as
having high or low privacy exposure and/or risk of misuse.
The context model is based on two main concepts: Contexts
of Interest (CoI) for modelling the familiarity of contexts
and Bluetooth devices for modelling familiar and unfamiliar
people in context.
6.1 Detection of Contexts of Interest (CoIs)
For our purpose, Contexts-of-Interest (CoIs) correspond
to locations that a user often visits and/or spends a sig-
niﬁcant amount of time in, e.g., home, workplace, grocery
store, etc. We consider two kinds of CoIs: GPS-based CoIs
which are geographical areas on the surface of the earth, and
WiFi-based CoIs that are characteristic sets of WiFi access
points usually observed in a speciﬁc place and thus identify-
ing the RF environment there. GPS CoIs capture signiﬁcant
places of the user in outdoor areas, and WiFi CoIs cover also
indoor locations in urban areas, where GPS can’t be used
but coverage of WiFi access points typically is available. By
combining both types of CoIs, we can identify and detect
most signiﬁcant places that users typically visit.

cumvent the enforcement of the context-aware access control
system is outside the scope of this paper.
2966.1.1 GPS-based CoIs
To identify GPS-based CoIs, we adopt the notions of stay
points and stay regions as introduced by Zheng et al. [46]
and developed further by Montoliu et al. [26]. The identiﬁ-
cation of GPS-based CoIs is based on position observations
obtained via GPS.
The sequence of GPS observations is divided into GPS
stay points, which represent visits of the user to diﬀerent
places, during which the user stays within a radius of rsp =
100 m from the ﬁrst GPS observation. In order for a visit to
be considered a stay point, the visit is also required to last
longer than t minsp = 10 min and not to contain observation
gaps longer than t gapsp = 5 min.
We calculate for each stay point an average position pos ¯sp
as the average of all position observations belonging to the
k=1 latk
,
stay point, i.e., pos ¯sp = (lat ¯sp, lon ¯sp), s.t. lat ¯sp =
and lon ¯sp =
. The average position of a stay point
represents the predominant location where the user has been
located during her visit to the stay point.

The average positions pos ¯sp of individual stay points are
aggregated to form rectangular geographical areas of at most
gpsmax = 100 m width and length. An area is a GPS-
based Context-of-Interest, if (i) the user has visited the area
more than f mincoi = 5 times and (ii) has spent longer than
t mincoi = 30 min in total in the area.
Example. As an illustrative running example, let us con-
sider a user who regularly commutes between her workplace
and home. Other places she regularly visits are a grocery
store and a public sports facility. She usually carries her
smartphone with her, which continuously senses her GPS
location and other context data.
When the user goes to the grocery store and stays there for
15 minutes, i.e., longer than t minsp = 10 min and moves
only within a radius of rsp = 100 m, a stay point sp of
duration dur(sp) = 15 min will be generated. The average
of all position observations pos i during the stay point visit
will be the stay point average position pos ¯sp, most likely
located in or near the grocery store. Waypoints along her
daily commuting routes, however, would not generate any
stay points, since on her way she does not spend suﬃciently
long time in the same limited area.
If our user visits the grocery store 10 times and stays
each time for 15 minutes, ten stay points will be generated.
These average positions will be aggregated into a GPS-based
CoI C , because their total stay duration of 2 hours and
30 minutes is longer than the required t mincoi = 30 min
and there are more than the required f mincoi = 5 stay
points falling inside the CoI. The area of the CoI will be
the smallest rectangle containing all the stay point average
positions pos ¯sp.
6.1.2 WiFi-based CoIs
For identifying WiFi-based CoIs, WiFi access point obser-
vations rf i are used. Each observation consists of the MAC
address of a detected WiFi access point and the timestamp
of the observation. The sequence of individual WiFi observa-
tions is divided into WiFi snapshots, which are subsequences
corresponding to observations obtained during a single WiFi
scan of duration t maxwiﬁ = 10 sec.
Following the notion of stay points for GPS observations,
we extend this concept to WiFi and divide the sequence of
WiFi snapshots into so-called WiFi stay points. The sim-
ilarity between snapshots is determined by calculating the
Jaccard distance 2 between the ﬁrst snapshot and subsequent
snapshots one-by-one. As long as the Jaccard distance be-
tween the snapshots is less than or equal to 0.5, which means
that the intersection of the snapshots is at least as large as
half of their union, the subsequent snapshots are assigned to
the stay point. The staypoint is considered complete, if the
Jaccard distance to new WiFi snapshots grows beyond 0.5
or there is a gap between consecutive WiFi snapshots that
is longer than t gapsp.
These criteria for WiFi stay points were selected, because
it is not uncommon that WiFi access points are missed in
scans [14]. This is apparently not dependent on the signal
strength of the missed access point, so one needs to take into
account that even very strong access point beacons will be
missed from time to time.
A WiFi stay point has a characteristic set of access points
char(wiﬁ sp) that includes those access points that occur at
least in half of all WiFi snapshots of the stay point. A set
of access points is a WiFi-based CoI, if there are at least
f mincoi WiFi stay points having this set of access points as
their characteristic set of access points, and the stay points
have a duration of at least t mincoi in total.
