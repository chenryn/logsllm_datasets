User: Is it possible to run a script each time the dev server starts? Also at each deploy to google?
I want the application to fill the database based on what some methods returns.
Is there any way to do this?

Assistant: Try to make wrapper around the server runner and script that run deployment. So you will be able to run custom code when you need.
