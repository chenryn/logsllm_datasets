Chimera has been observed to collect the SYSTEM registry and `ntds.dit` files from targeted systems. Specifically, Chimera has utilized the NtdsAudit tool to extract password hashes of domain users by executing the following command:

```bash
msadcs.exe "NTDS.dit" -s "SYSTEM" -p RecordedTV_pdmp.txt --users-csv RecordedTV_users.csv
```

Additionally, Chimera has employed `ntdsutil` to copy the Active Directory database.
