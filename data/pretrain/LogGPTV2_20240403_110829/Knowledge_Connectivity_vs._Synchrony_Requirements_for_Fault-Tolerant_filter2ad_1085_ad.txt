Safety. (i) Let us ﬁrst prove that if node pi is in the unique
k-strongly connected sink component then algorithm SINK
returns true. From Lemma 2, the COLLECT algorithm re-
turns a list of all nodes reachable from pi in Gdi. Conse-
quently, nodes in the unique k-strongly connected sink will
have the same view of the system and the execution of line
9 returns the same i.known set to all nodes in the sink. In
this case, every node pj in view i.known which executes
line 13 will respond ack to pi’s request (line 15). Thus, the
condition in line 24 will never be satisﬁed. Moreover, since
there are at least s = (|i.known| − f) correct processes in
the system, at least a number of s responses will be received

and the algorithm terminates returning true (lines 22-23).
(ii) Let us now prove that if algorithm SINK returns true
then node pi is in the unique k-strongly connected sink com-
ponent. Assume by contradiction that pi does not belong
to the unique sink of Gdi. If that is the case, i.known is
composed by processes belonging to other components than
pi’s (Lemma 2). By the connectivity of the graph, there are
at least k nodes in each one of the m components in Gdi.
Since f  max{t1, t2}. Since nodes in the sinks are
unaware about the existence of other nodes, by the validity
property of consensus, nodes in G1 decide for the value v
and nodes in G2 decide for the value w, violating the agree-
ment and reaching thus a contradiction.

5 Conclusion
In this paper, we investigated the trade-off between
knowledge about the system and synchrony assumptions
to enable consensus in fault-prone unknown systems.
It
turns out that if knowledge connectivity is k-OSR, then
consensus can be solved assuming minimal synchrony as-
sumptions. Our approach is constructive, and an interest-
ing side effect of our design is that the uniform version of
the consensus can be solved as well, with no particular ef-
fort. This complements nicely previous studies that showed
that complete synchrony was needed whenever only min-
imal knowledge connectivity (OSR) was available. Inter-
estingly enough, the same previous solution did not enable
uniform consensus.
