User: I used to deploy Python web applications on AWS EC2 instances with Ansible.
In my development environment, I use config from a module local_config.py, but in the deployment process, I use an Ansible task to replace this file with a production-ready config.
How do I do something similar when building a Docker image?
Assistant: You should copy your production-ready config file into the docker container as part of your image-building process (COPY directive in your dockerfile), and then proceed with the same deployment steps you would normally use.
