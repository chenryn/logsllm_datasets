Currently IdsQueryBuilder does support only appending arrays of identifiers
and converting them to lists:
    public IdsQueryBuilder addIds(String... ids) {
            values.addAll(Arrays.asList(ids));
            return this;
        }
In cases of huge numbers of IDs submitted to builder it could be more wise of
performance to merge with lists directly. Or are there any better ideas?
