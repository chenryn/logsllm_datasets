#### Overview
- **Dates:** May 10-11, 2010
- **Type:** International cyber defense exercise (CDX)
- **Organizers:** CCD CoE and Swedish National Defence College
- **Participants:**
  - **Blue Teams:** Six teams from Northern European governments, military, private sector, and academia.
  - **Red Team:** 20 friendly hackers.
- **Scenario:** Cyber terrorists vs. power generation companies.

#### Geographic Context
- **Baltic Sea Region:**
  - **Sweden**
  - **Estonia (Tallinn)**
- **Historical Context:**
  - **2007 Street Disturbances in Estonia**
  - **2007 Cyber Attack on Estonia**

#### Introduction
- **Are Cyber Attacks a Threat to National Security?**
  - **Cyber Terrorism and Cyber Warfare:** Opinions range from dismissive to apocalyptic.
  - **Potential Targets:** Electricity, water, air traffic control, stock exchanges, national elections, etc.

#### Trends
- **National Critical Infrastructures:** Increasingly connected to the internet.
- **IT Systems:** Custom systems are being replaced with less expensive, off-the-shelf Windows and UNIX solutions.
- **Network Resilience:** Traditionally closed networks (e.g., SCADA) are not designed for resiliency.
- **Hacking Facilitation:** Familiarity with operating systems may facilitate hacking.

#### National Security Thinking
- **Understanding Cyber Attacks:**
  - **Case Studies:** Real-world examples.
  - **Information Accessibility:** Much information is outside the public domain.
  - **Internet-Enabled Militaries:** No wars yet between two fully Internet-enabled militaries.
- **Simulation Necessity:** Must be able to simulate cyber attacks and defenses in a laboratory setting.

#### Moving Target
- **Realistic CDXs:**
  - **Challenges:** Simulating adversaries, friendly forces, and the battlefield.
  - **Validity:** Conclusions may be valid for a short time.
- **Complexity and Dynamics:**
  - **Rapid Proliferation:** Computing devices, processing power, user-friendly hacker tools, practical encryption, and web-enabled intelligence collection.

#### Half-Life
- **Military and Computers:**
  - **Training:** Tank drivers, pilots.
  - **Simulation:** Battles, campaigns, and complex geopolitical scenarios.
- **Modeling Reality:**
  - **Failure Factors:** Poor intelligence, miscalculations, incorrect assumptions, scoring system, political considerations.
  - **Example:** The $250 million Millennium Challenge in 2002.

#### Cyber Defense Exercise Structure
- **Team Roles:**
  - **Blue Team:** Friendly forces (real-life system administrators and computer security specialists).
    - **Goal:** Defend network confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) against hostile Red Teams.
    - **Scoring:** Automated and/or manual.
  - **Red Team:** Hostile forces (cyber attackers).
    - **Goal:** Undermine CIA of Blue Team networks.
    - **Tactics:** Almost no limitations on the virtual battlefield.
    - **Testing:** White box vs. black box.
  - **Green Team:** Technical infrastructure (designs, hosts network infrastructure, records traffic, manages automated scoring).
  - **White Team:** Game management (manages and referees the CDX, writes game scenario, rules, scoring system, makes in-game adjustments, prevents cheating, declares the winner).

#### Scenario
- **Strategic Significance:**
  - **Resource Estimation:** Lone hacker, organization, nation-state?
  - **Threat Perception:** Can a lone hacker be a national security threat?
  - **Out-of-the-Box Thinking:** Always helpful.
  - **Real-World Impact:** Can only real-world attacks change threat perception?

#### Cyber War Philosophy
- **Non-Traditional Warfare:**
  - **Tactical Victories:** Reshuffling of bits.
  - **Real-World Effects:** Cyber attacks as extraordinary means to many ends (espionage, DoS, identity theft, propaganda, infrastructure manipulation, etc.).

#### The Art of (Cyber) War
- **Sun Tzu's Five Ways of Attacking with Fire:**
  - Burn soldiers in their camp.
  - Burn stores.
  - Burn baggage trains.
  - Burn arsenals and magazines.
  - Hurl dropping fire amongst the enemy.
- **Modern Example:** www.hizbulla.org attack on October 25, 2000.

#### Strategic Thinking
- **Internet Vulnerability:**
  - High return on investment.
  - Inadequacy of cyber defenses.
  - Plausible deniability.
  - Growing power of non-state actors.

#### CDX Goals
- **Red Team vs. Blue Team:**
  - Credible simulation of net attack and defense.
  - Acquisition/prevention of unauthorized access.
  - Real-world impact.
  - Political/military results (ranging from minor annoyance to national security crisis).

#### Nation-State Simulation
- **Full-Scope Actors:**
  - Military and government agencies.
  - Deep well of national IT expertise (cryptography, programming, debugging, vulnerability discovery, agent-based systems, etc.).
  - Supported by experts in natural sciences, physical security, supply chain, business continuity, social engineering, etc.
- **Example:** Sandia National Labs (robust Red Team, targeting military installations, oil companies, banks, electric utilities, e-commerce firms, specializing in hidden vulnerabilities in complex environments).

#### CDX History
- **Uniqueness:**
  - Every CDX is unique due to rapid IT evolution and numerous variables.
  - Both lab-based and real-world exercises.
  - Cyber defenders may or may not be warned.
- **Examples:**
  - **Eligible Receiver (1997):** 35 NSA personnel simulating "North Korean" hackers targeting the U.S. Pacific Command.
  - **Water Security (2006):** Environmental Protection Agency assessing vulnerabilities in water distribution plants.
  - **International CDXs:**
    - **2006 DHS Cyber Storm:** Non-state "hacktivists."
    - **2008 Cyber Storm II:** Nation-state cyber and physical attacks.
    - **2009 CDX in Tajikistan:** U.S., Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Afghanistan.

#### Baltic Cyber Shield 2010
- **Dates:** May 10-11, 2010
- **Participants:**
  - **Seven Northern European Countries**
  - **Six National Blue Teams**
  - **Twenty-Hacker International Red Team**
- **Live-Fire CDX:**
  - Unscripted battle.
  - Malicious code both authorized and encouraged within the virtual battlefield.

#### Inspiration
- **U.S. National Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition**
- **International Cyber Defense Workshop (ICDW)**
- **UCSB International Capture the Flag (iCTF)**
- **Annual U.S. Military CDXs**
- **CCD COE-SWE CDX, Dec 2008**

#### BCS 2010 Scenario
- **Exploration of Cyber Terrorism:**
  - **Target:** Power supply company (CII/SCADA infrastructure).
  - **Blue Teams:** Security inspection failures/insider fears, hired-gun Rapid Response Team.
  - **Red Team:** Attacks intensify throughout the exercise.

#### BCS Goals
1. **Hands-on Training:** Blue Team training in CII defense.
2. **International Collaboration:** Highlight the international nature of cyberspace (technical, institutional, legal, political, etc.).
3. **Improvement:** Enhance future CDXs through "lessons learned" and surveys.

#### White Team
- **Organizers:** CCD CoE Tallinn, SNDC Stockholm.
- **Scoring Criteria:**
  - Based on network CIA.
  - Office infrastructure and external services.
  - Points awarded for thwarted attacks, business requests, innovative strategies, and tactics.
  - Points deducted for critical system, service, and compromise.

This revised version aims to provide a clear, coherent, and professional overview of the Baltic Cyber Shield 2010 exercise.
