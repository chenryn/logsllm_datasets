Introduction
• Are cyber attacks a threat to national security?
–Cyber terrorism, cyber warfare
• Expert opinions
• Dismissive to apocalyptic
• What would the targets be?
–Electricity, water, air traffic control, stock ex-
change, national elections…
Trends
• National critical infrastructures increasingly 
connected to the Net
• Custom IT systems replaced with less 
expensive, off-the-shelf Windows and UNIX
• Traditionally closed networks (eg SCADA) not 
designed for resiliency
• OS familiarity may facilitate hacking
Nat’l Security Thinking
• Cyber attacks: better understanding required
– Some real-world case studies
– Much information lies outside public domain
– No wars yet between two Internet-enabled
militaries
• Must be able to simulate cyber attack and 
defense in a laboratory
Moving Target
• Realistic CDXs are a challenge
– Must simulate adversary, friendly forces, even the
battlefield
– Conclusions may be valid for a short time
• IT, hacking are complex and dynamic
– Rapid proliferation of computing devices, 
processing power, user-friendly hacker tools, 
practical encryption, Web-enabled intelligence
collection
Half-Life
• The military and computers…
– Train tank drivers, pilots
– Simulate battles, campaigns, complex geopolitical
scenarios
• How well can a sim model the real world?
• Failure factors
– Poor intelligence, miscalculations, incorrect
assumptions, scoring system, political considerations
– 2002: $250 million Millennium Challenge
Cyber Defense Exercise
• Robust CDX requires team-oriented approach
– Blue Team: friendly forces
– Red Team: hostile forces
– Green Team: technical infrastructure
– White Team: game management
Blue Team
• Real-life system administrators and computer
security specialists
– Primary targets for instruction
• Goal
– Defend network confidentiality, integrity, and 
availability (CIA) vs hostile RT
– Scoring: automated and/or manual system
Red Team
• The cyber attacker
– BCS: “cyber terrorist”
• Goal
– Undermine CIA of BT networks
• Tactics
– On virtual battlefield, almost no limitations
• “White box” vs “black box” testing
– The question of prior knowledge
White Team
• Manages and referees CDX
– Writes game scenario, rules, scoring system
– Makes in-game adjustments
– Tries to prevent cheating
• EX: firewall rule detrimental to game and/or
unrealistic?
– Declares the “winner”
Green Team
• Designs, hosts network infrastructure
• In-game ISP
• Records traffic for post-game analysis
• Manages automated scoring
• Virtual machine technology
• Possible with few resources, but…
• Sim powerful adversary = many resources
• EX: RT plan should indicate money, manpower
• VPN technology
• Teams can log in from anywhere
Scenario
• Helps determine strategic significance
• Estimate resources and cost
– Lone hacker, org, nation-state?
• Can a lone hacker be a nat’l sec threat?
• Out-of-the-box thinking
– Always helpful
• Can only real-world attacks change threat
perception?
Cyber War Philosophy
• Cyber warfare is not traditional warfare
• Tactical victories: reshuffling of bits
• Any real-world effects?
• Cyber attack
• Not an end in itself
• Extraordinary means to many ends
• Espionage, DoS, identity theft, propaganda, 
infrastructure manipulation, ?
The Art of (Cyber) War
Sun Tzu said: There are five ways of 
attacking with fire. The first is to burn 
soldiers in their camp; the second is to 
burn stores; the third is to burn baggage 
trains; the fourth is to burn arsenals and 
magazines; the fifth is to hurl dropping 
fire amongst the enemy.

Electronic Pearl Harbor?
July 19, 2010
Strategic Thinking
1. The Internet is vulnerable
2. High return on investment
3. Inadequacy of cyber defenses
4. Plausible deniability
5. Growing power of non-state actors
6. ?
CDX: Goals
• RT vs BT
• Credible simulation of net attack and defense
• Acquisition / prevention of unauthorized access
• Real-world impact
• Political / military results?
• Zip, minor annoyance, or national security crisis?
Nation-State Simulation
• Mil / gov agencies are “full-scope” actors
• Much more than computer hacking
• Deep well of nat’l IT expertise
• Crypto, prog, debug, vuln discovery, agent-
based systems, etc
• Supported in turn by experts in other disciplines
• Natural sciences, physical security, supply
chain, continuity of business, social
engineering, etc
EX: Sandia Nat’l Labs 
• Robust RT
• Kills: mil installations, oil companies, banks, 
electric utilities, e-commerce firms
• Specialize in hidden vulns in complex environmts
• Obscure infrastr interdep in specific domains
• Former chief
• “Our general method is to ask system owners: 
‘What's your worst nightmare?’ and then we set
about to make that happen”
CDX history
• Every CDX is unique
– Good and bad
– IT evolves too quickly
– Too many variables in cyberspace
• Both lab-based and real-world
• Cyber defenders may / may not be warned
Eligible Receiver (1997)
• 35 NSA personnel
• “North Korean” hackers
• Target: U.S. Pacific Command
• J. Adams in Foreign Affairs
• “human command-and-control system” infected
with “paralyzing level of mistrust”
• “nobody in the chain of command, from the
president on down, could believe anything”
• Also revealed that many nat’l critical infrastr
vulnerable to cyber attack
Water Security
• 2006: Environmental Protection Agency
• Could a hacker poison the water supply?
• Sandia vuln assessm’t: distrib plants serving
>100,000
• 350 such facilities = too many!
• Thorough analysis: 5 sites
• Risk Assessm’t Methodology for Water (RAM-W)
International CDXs
• Internat’l architecture, internat’l responsibility
• 2006 DHS Cyber Storm
– Scen: non-state “hacktivists”
– Gov collab w/ private sector
• 2008 Cyber Storm II
– Scen: Nation-state
– Cy / phys attacks: coms, chem, RR, pipe infra
• 2009 CDX: remote, mountainous Tajikistan
– U.S., Taj, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Afghanistan
Baltic Cyber Shield
• 10-11 May 2010
– 7 northern European countries
– 6 national BTs
– 20-hacker internat’l RT
• “Live-fire” CDX
– Unscripted battle
– Malicious code both authorized and encouraged
• Within virtual battlefield
Insipiration
• U.S. National Collegiate Cyber Defense
Competition
• International Cyber Defense Workshop (ICDW)
• UCSB International Capture the Flag (iCTF)
• Annual U.S. military CDXs
• CCD COE-SWE CDX, Dec 2008
BCS 2010 Scenario

Technical, institutional, legal, political, etc
3. Improve future CDXs
–
“Lessons learned”
