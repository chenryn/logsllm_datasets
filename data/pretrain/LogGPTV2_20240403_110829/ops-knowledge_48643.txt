want to use users gmail account.
Assistant: You basically need to do it in two steps:

Do what systempuntoout's answer said to only allow logged-in users to see your site.
On each of your routes (URL handlers), the first step should be to get their user object and check if they are on a list you're keeping of users allowed to see your app. For a first run, you could just have the list be a global variable, but this isn't very flexible (it makes you redeploy your app every time you want to update the list), so for a second run you should refactor it to perhaps read from the Datastore to see if a user is in the allowed list or not.
