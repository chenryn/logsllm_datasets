User: Im trying to find a module that will allow me to run a script locally that will:
1. Open a text file on a remote Windows Machine
2. Read the lines of the text file
3. Store the lines in a variable and be able to process the data.
This is absolutely no problem on a Linux machine via SSH, but I have no clue what module to use for a remote Windows machine. I can connect no problem and run commands on a remote Windows machine via WMI,but WMI does not have a way to read/write to files. Are there any modules out there that I can install to achieve this process?
Assistant: You can use powershell for this.
first Open powershell by admin previlage.
Enter this command

Enable-PSRemoting -Force

Enter this command also on both computer so they trust eachother.

Set-Item wsman:\localhost\client\trustedhosts *

then restart winrm service on both pc by this command.

Restart-Service WinRM

test it by this command

Test-WsMan computername

for executing a Remote Command.

Invoke-Command -ComputerName COMPUTER -ScriptBlock { COMMAND }
  -credential USERNAME

for starting remote session.

Enter-PSSession -ComputerName COMPUTER -Credential USER
