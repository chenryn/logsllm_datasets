  "Failed to connect (titleField) outlet from (MMSessionPickerChoosenRowView) to (NSTextField): missing setter or instance variable",  "This log statement is a technical error message that appears when the software is attempting to connect an outlet in code to an NSTextField user interface element and is unable to do so. The error message indicates that the outlet called \"titleField\" in the \"MMSessionPickerChoosenRowView\" class is missing either a setter method or an instance variable. \n\nOutlets are connections between an object in the software and the user interface elements it controls. In this case, the outlet is attempting to connect to an NSTextField element, which is a text field used to display information to the user. The missing setter or instance variable means that the software is unable to update the value of this element when needed. \n\nThe cause of this error could be a variety of issues, such as a typo or missing code in the connection between the text field and the outlet. Resolution of this error requires troubleshooting and debugging of the software code to locate the root cause of the issue preventing the connection from being established."

  "no application identifier provided, can't use provisioning profiles [pid=37563]",  "This log message indicates that there was an attempt to perform provisioning on an iOS mobile device or simulator, but the provisioning profile used did not include an application identifier. The application identifier is a unique identifier assigned to an iOS application by Apple, which is used to match the app to its corresponding provisioning profile.\n\nWithout an application identifier in the provisioning profile, the system is unable to match the provisioning profile to the specific app that is being installed or updated. As a result, the provisioning process fails, which can lead to errors or issues with the operation of the app on the device or simulator.\n\nIn order to resolve this issue, the provisioning profile needs to be updated to include the correct application identifier. This can be done by regenerating the provisioning profile using the correct app ID or by modifying the existing profile to add the app ID. Once the provisioning profile is updated, the device or simulator should be able to successfully provision the app and run it without issues."

When a TLS connection is established between two endpoints, a \"handshake\" process begins where the endpoints negotiate the encryption and decryption protocols to be used. Once the secure channel has been established, the two endpoints can communicate securely. \n\nWhen a CLOSE_NOTIFY alert is sent, it means that one endpoint wants to terminate the secure communication channel. In response to the CLOSE_NOTIFY alert, the other endpoint will initiate a \"close_notify\" message to indicate that it has received the alert and is also closing the connection.\n\nIn the context of this log message, the \"tcp_connection_destination_handle_tls_close_notify\" function is responsible for handling and responding to the CLOSE_NOTIFY alert. The log message indicates that this function has closed the socket (i.e., the endpoint's communication channel), presumably because the connection has been successfully terminated."

  "CFNetwork SSLHandshake failed (-9802)",  "The log message \"CFNetwork SSLHandshake failed (-9802)\" indicates an error while establishing a secure connection between the client and server over HTTPS using the SSL/TLS protocol. This error code (-9802) is specific to macOS, iOS, and other Apple platforms, and it usually relates to a problem with the server's certificate or the client's trust settings. One possible cause of this error is an expired or invalid SSL certificate on the server side. Another reason could be an incorrect configuration of the SSL settings on the client or server, for example, using an outdated or insecure protocol version or having a mismatch in the cipher suite or private key. To resolve this issue, you can try checking the SSL certificate validity, update the SSL/TLS settings, or adjust the firewall or proxy settings. It is recommended to consult with your system administrator or network security team for further assistance."
