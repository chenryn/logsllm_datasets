Question: As a web application security tester, you are evaluating a web application that uses server-side scripting. You suspect that the application might be vulnerable to code injection attacks. Which of the following steps would be most effective in identifying and assessing potential injection points for code execution vulnerabilities?
"A": "Inspecting the application's source code to identify places where input is directly included into dynamic queries or commands without proper sanitization.",
"B": "Checking for strong encryption on data transmission to prevent code from being injected into the application.",
"C": "Testing for SQL injection vulnerabilities since code injection is a subset of SQL injection.",
"D": "Looking for user input fields and ensuring they have maximum length restrictions as the sole security measure."
Answer: A
