When creating an array from 0.2 to 0.8, the maximum value in the array is 0.8,
but when I run max of the whole array, I found the maximum value different
from 0.8. It has digits in the 15th and 16th decimal.  
When the same is done with 0.7 as the ending value, the maximum of the array
is 0.60000000009.. and the value of 0.7 is not included in the array.
