User: I have a CentOS 5.8 server and am planning to install a later version of python (presumably 2.7). I have heard a lot of mention that CentOS relies quite heavily on 2.4 for many admin features etc. I'm trying to determine exactly what these features are (and whether I would actually be using them) so that I can decide whether to update python through yum or build from source.
Can anyone give me some more detailed information on what CentOS features have dependencies on Python 2.4.
Assistant: If python2.7 is available on  Yum, you should use that: the package management on large distros (redhat, ubuntu, debian, fedora ) takes care of maintaining parallel Python installs for you which won't conflict with each other.
This option should keep your system "/usr/bin/pythonÂ¬ file pointing to Python2.4 and give you another python2.7 binary.
Otherwise, if you choose to build it from source, pick another prefix - /opt - (not even /usr/local will be quite safe) for building it. 
You don't need to know exactly which system parts depend on Python 2.4 - just rest assured it will crash very hard and unpredictably if you try to modify the system Python itself.
