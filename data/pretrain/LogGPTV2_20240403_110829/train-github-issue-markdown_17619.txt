This module looks vaguelly like
    pub mod os {
      pub mod consts {
        ... various reexports ...
        pub mod android { ... }
        pub mod linux { .... }
      }
    }
All constants for all platforms are available to all platforms. There is no
bound to the number of public modules that must be added here over time, and
doubtless different implementations of Rust must support different platforms.
In other words, as designed this module will never stop changing. This is a
mess waiting to happen. I suggest only exposing the current arch and moving
any necessary cross-arch capability into rustc directly. Nominating.
