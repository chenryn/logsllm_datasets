This module is structured as follows:

```rust
pub mod os {
    pub mod consts {
        // Various re-exports
        pub mod android { /* ... */ }
        pub mod linux { /* ... */ }
        // Potentially more platform-specific modules
    }
}
```

Currently, all constants for all platforms are available to every platform, which can lead to a disorganized and ever-expanding structure. There is no limit to the number of public modules that may need to be added over time, and different Rust implementations will likely support different platforms. As designed, this module will continuously change, creating a potential maintenance issue.

To address this, I suggest only exposing the constants relevant to the current architecture and moving any necessary cross-architecture capabilities directly into `rustc`. This approach will help maintain a cleaner and more manageable codebase. I am nominating this change for consideration.
