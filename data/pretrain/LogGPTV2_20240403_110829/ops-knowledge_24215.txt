User: I am writing an app engine application to fetch url content using urlfetch available in google app engine. 
however in the app.yaml file, I have a doubt in script handle 
I have found that some people use script name as myScript.py while some tutorials use myScript.app 
what's the difference between the two uses  ?
Assistant: The myScript.py was for the 2.5 runtime, the model for invoking apps with 2.7 runtime normally utilises the myScript.app method. Have a look at the age of the tutorials and also what Python runtime they have configured in their app.yaml.
