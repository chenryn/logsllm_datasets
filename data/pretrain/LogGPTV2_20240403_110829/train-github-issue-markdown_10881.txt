When you `curl ip:9200/name/_mappings` (or `_settings`, for example), you get
a response with the JSON object.
But when you do `curl -I ip:9200/name/_mappings`, you get 404.
Why? Because `-I` is not a GET operation, but a HEAD one, and it's not
implemented.
I think this is strange behaviour. According to HTTP protocol spec:
> The HEAD method is identical to GET except that the server MUST NOT  
>  return a message-body in the response. The metainformation contained  
>  in the HTTP headers in response to a HEAD request SHOULD be identical  
>  to the information sent in response to a GET request.
So would be nice to have the HEAD acting the same as GET here (without body
response), instead of returning 404. I wasted some time trying to figure out
what was wrong until i removed `-I` ðŸ˜•
