#6848 is no where mentioned in the release notes. There's a single item on
`.order`
changing to quicksort, but it doesn't explicitly warn that the sort was
previously stable  
and now isn't. There's also no warning about `series.sort` changing as well.  
That API has been around forever and afaict nothing was gained by breaking it.
This was a fairly reckless change in my opinion, I do wish the current
maintainers  
cared more about backwards-compatibility then they seem to in the latest
releases.
