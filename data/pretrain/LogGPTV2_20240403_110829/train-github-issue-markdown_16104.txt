You can find the correct location on the tree view, but on title the location
don't change.
If this location is represent for the current folder on the view, it will
confuse the user. It will be a disaster for a user editing 2 files with the
same name in different folders.
I think this title is to indicate the current file location, so this must be a
bug..
