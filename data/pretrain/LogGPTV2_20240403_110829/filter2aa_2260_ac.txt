Tactical Interoperable Communications Scorecards 
As illustrated above, the development of 
a TICP in each urban/metropolitan area 
was followed by a validation exercise to 
demonstrate agencies’ ability to use the 
TICP procedures with their existing 
interoperable communications assets.  
The results of those exercises were 
provided to the areas to include in 
improvement plans for future TICP 
revisions and training efforts.  The 
scorecard summarizes the progress 
made 
to 
date—from 
the 
TICP 
development through the exercise and 
After Action Reports (AAR)—and provides a foundation for each area’s next steps as it continues 
to enhance its interoperable communications capabilities.

To complete the scorecards, documentation from the G&T TICP process was reviewed, including 
the TICP, TICP Peer Review, Exercise Evalution Guide (EEG), AAR, Improvement Plan (IP), and 
Self Assessment Discussion (described below).  Subject matter expert (SME) panels—composed 
of SMEs with state and local public safety operational and communications technology 
backgrounds in addition to representatives from G&T, SAFECOM, and the WMO—reviewed all key 
documents to assess Governance, SOPs, and Usage-related information.  Five panels of SMEs 
met over a 6-week period to review all of the documentation provided for the urban/metropolitan 
areas.  Through a facilitated process, the review panels arrived at consensus results, findings, and 
recommendations for each area.  The resulting scorecards will be shared with and can be used by 
each area to support future investment justifications for improvements to regional interoperable 
communications.

The TICP for an urban/metropolitan area identifies specific 
problems, needs, and barriers to communications among 
the area’s agencies and disciplines.  The plan identifies 
potential partners and their roles and responsibilities. It 
inventories the area’s communications resources and 
details how those resources would be used to provide fast, 
on-scene, mission-critical voice communications among all 
first-responder agencies.  The plan must specify a level of 
communication appropriate for the incident and complies 
with the incident command system defined in the National 
Incident Management System (NIMS) model.

The scorecards represent the culmination of volumes of data that have been analyzed to identify 
interoperable communications trends, best practices, and other insights useful in guiding both the 
urban/metropolitan areas and DHS programs.  Although more analysis will be necessary, the 
following sections represent the key general trends and specific findings across the Interoperability 
Continuum elements.

Analysis of the scorecard results provides information that is beneficial to DHS as it improves the 
assistance provided to state and local agencies.  Two common trends across all areas include 
1) areas developing and/or using shared systems tended to demonstrate more mature 
governance structures, SOPs, and usage; and 2) areas that diversified their funding sources to 
address sustained interoperability tended to also have stronger governance structures in 
place. General scorecard findings across all types of areas (i.e., urban and metropolitan) are 
presented below.   
Overall Scorecard Trends
Overall Scorecard Trends
Overall Scorecard Trends
Overall Scorecard Trends    
• Policies for interoperable communications are now in place in all 75 urban/metropolitan areas. 
• Regular testing and exercises are needed to effectively link disparate systems to allow 
communications between multi-jurisdictional responders (including State and Federal) during crisis.  
• The DHS Tactical Interoperable Communications Initiative has played a fundamental role in advancing 
interoperability in the urban/metropolitan areas. 
• Cooperation among first responders in the field is strong, but formalized governance (leadership and 
planning) across regions has lagged.  Governance will be critical in planning for larger-scale, multi-
jurisdictional responses and implementation of next-generation technology. 
• Areas that were part of the FY 2005 UASI Grant Program tended to demonstrate greater traction in 
strategic planning across the region. 
• Areas that had a history of multijurisdictional cooperation because of prior incidents demonstrated 
stronger SOPs and Usage. 
• Many of the exercises were more complicated in terms of the number and type of participating 
agencies; this provided more insight into the breadth of the SOPs and the depth of Usage; areas with 
less complicated exercises and fewer participants scored higher in Usage because the events required 
less coordination. 
• Areas that were empowered to develop a TICP based on a “bottom-up” approach of a collaborative, 
regional nature scored higher in Governance than those areas in which a “top-down” state-centric 
approach was used.

Governance Findings    
Governance measures the maturity of five basic elements critical to a successful and established 
governance structure: 1) Decision Making Groups, 2) Agreements, 3) Strategic Planning, 4) 
Interoperability Funding, and 5) Leadership. 
Governance Finding 
1—Informal 
cooperation among 
multi-agency 
first 
responders 
often 
precedes 
a 
formalized 
and 
established regional 
governance 
structure:   
While 
many 
urban/metropolitan 
areas 
are 
at 
the 
Intermediate 
and 
Established levels of 
maturity 
in 
their 
regional governance 
and planning efforts, the first responders and public safety organizations within the region often 
had been informally cooperating for years.  Because of the lack of formal documentation of these 
relationships, “Governance” results tended to lag significantly behind “Usage” in the scorecards.   
Governance Finding 2—Areas with pre-existing DHS 
Urban Area Working Groups were more likely to have 
a Regional Communications Committees:  More than 
75 percent of DHS-funded urban areas have developed 
regional communications committees to address the issue 
of communications interoperability.  While some of these 
committees focus specifically on the use of federal grant 
funding for interoperability, others have developed a 
broader mandate to address other communications 
interoperability issues across the region (beyond the scope of federal grants).  Among metropolitan 
areas, just under half have developed formal committees.  In cases in which the states had strong 
governance structures, metropolitan areas tended to align their decision making bodies and 
strategies with the statewide efforts.   As indicated by the overall governance results for both urban 
and metropolitan areas, a communications committee represents a critical step in regional 
interoperability oversight.  However, the groups are not consistently supported by their jurisdictions 
in efforts to put formal agreements in place, develop strategic plans (including funding strategies), 
and influence interoperable communications policy and funding decisions.   
Governance Finding 3—Governance is a good indicator of the existence of advanced 
technology, more mature SOPs, and more proficient usage because it provides the 
foundation for communications interoperability:  In the urban/metropolitan areas that did have 
a formalized and established governance structure, the first responders and public safety 
organizations were able to demonstrate a higher level of proficiency in interoperable 
communications equipment usage and generally had more mature SOPs, which were accepted 
and practiced.  This proficiency may be, in part, a result of the larger, more seamless shared

systems that more closely correlate with an established regional governance structure.  This 
correlation is based on the fact that areas with shared systems must have developed and adopted 
consensus requirements, funding strategies, and longer term agreements to support mutual 
system use. 
Governance Finding 4—
Few 
urban/metropolitan 
areas have completed a 
strategic plan for regional 
interoperable 
communications:  Beyond 
the operational policies of 
the TICP or the broad scope 
to the Urban Area Homeland 
Security 
Strategies, 
few 
urban/metropolitan 
areas 
have 
developed 
strategic 
plans specifically for regional interoperable communications (including sustainable funding plans).  
In cases where strategic planning processes had begun, it was often noted in the documentation 
that the region was developing a plan completely separate from the operational focus of the TICP.
