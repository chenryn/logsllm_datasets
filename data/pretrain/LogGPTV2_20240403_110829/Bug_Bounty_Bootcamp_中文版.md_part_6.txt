范围内的资产
1.  *a.example.com*
2.  *b.example.com*
3.  *c.example.com*
4.  *users.example.com*
5.  *landing.example.com*
**Out-of-scope assets**
超出范围的资产
1.  *dev.example.com*
2.  *test.example.com*
[ ]{#c01.xhtml#Page_10 .pagebreak title="10"} Assets that are listed as
in scope are the ones that you are allowed to hack. On the other hand,
assets that are listed as out of scope are off-limits to bug bounty
hunters. Be extra careful and abide by the rules! Hacking an
out-of-scope asset is illegal.
在范围内的资产是你被允许攻击的资产。另一方面，被列为不在范围内的资产是禁止赏金猎人攻击的。请格外小心并遵守规定！攻击不在范围内的资产是违法的。
The company will also often list the vulnerabilities it considers valid
bugs:
公司还经常列出其认为有效的漏洞：
**In-scope vulnerabilities**
在范围内的漏洞
1.  All except the ones listed as out of scope
**Out-of-scope vulnerabilities**
超出范围的漏洞
1.  Self-XSS
2.  Clickjacking
3.  Missing HTTP headers and other best practices without direct
    security impact
4.  Denial-of-service attacks
5.  Use of known-vulnerable libraries, without proof of exploitability
6.  Results of automated scanners, without proof of exploitability
The out-of-scope vulnerabilities that you see in this example are
typical of what you would find in bug bounty programs. Notice that many
programs consider non-exploitable issues, like violations of best
practice, to be out of scope.
在此示例中看到的超出范围漏洞是赏金计划中常见的。请注意，许多计划认为不可利用的问题（如违反最佳实践）超出了范围。
Any program with large asset and vulnerability scopes is a good place to
start for a beginner. The larger the asset scope, the larger the number
of target applications and web pages you can look at. When a program has
a big asset scope, you can often find obscure applications that are
overlooked by other hackers. This typically means less competition when
reporting bugs.
任何覆盖范围大且具有易受攻击性的程序对初学者来说都是一个良好的起点。资产范围越大，你能够察看的目标应用程序和网页就越多。当一个程序覆盖范围较广时，你通常可以找到其他黑客忽略的不常见的应用程序。这意味着在报告漏洞时会有更少的竞争。
The larger the vulnerability scope, the more types of bugs the
organization is willing to hear reports about. These programs are a lot
easier to find bugs in, because you have more opportunities, and so can
play to your strengths.
随着风险范围的扩大，组织愿意接受关于更多类型的漏洞报告。这些程序更容易发现漏洞，因为您有更多机会，可以发挥自己的优势。
### Payout Amounts {#c01.xhtml#h2-123456c01-0010}
The next metric you should consider is the program's *payout amounts* .
There are two types of payment programs: *vulnerability disclosure
programs* *(VDPs)* and *bug bounty programs* .
你需要考虑的下一个指标是该计划的支付金额。有两种支付方案：漏洞披露计划（VDP）和漏洞赏金计划。
VDPs are *reputation-only programs* , meaning they do not pay for
findings but often offer rewards such as reputation points and swag.
They are a great way to learn about hacking if making money is not your
primary objective. Since they don't pay, they're less competitive, and
so easier to find bugs in. You can use them to practice finding common
vulnerabilities and communicating with security engineers.
VDP是仅限声誉的计划，意味着它们不支付发现费用，但通常提供声誉点和赠品等奖励。如果赚钱不是您的主要目标，它们是学习黑客的绝佳方式。由于它们不支付，竞争性更弱，因此更容易发现漏洞。您可以使用它们来练习查找常见的漏洞并与安全工程师沟通。
On the other hand, bug bounty programs offer varying amounts of monetary
rewards for your findings. In general, the more severe the
vulnerability, the more the report will pay. But different programs have
different payout averages for each level of severity. You can find a
program's payout information on its bug bounty pages, usually listed in
a section called the *payout* [ ]{#c01.xhtml#Page_11 .pagebreak
title="11"} table. Typically, low-impact issues will pay anywhere from
\$50 to \$500 (USD), while critical issues can pay upward of \$10,000.
However, the bug bounty industry is evolving, and payout amounts are
increasing for high-impact bugs. For example, Apple now rewards up to
\$1 million for the most severe vulnerabilities.
另一方面，漏洞赏金计划为您发现的漏洞提供不同金额的奖励。一般来说，漏洞越严重，报告所得的酬金就越高。但不同的计划对于不同严重程度的漏洞，有着不同的平均赔付标准。您可以在漏洞赏金页面上找到计划的赔付信息，通常是在一个称为赔付表的部分中列出。通常来说，低影响的问题可以获得50到500美元（美元）的奖励，而严重的问题可以获得超过10,000美元的奖励。然而，漏洞赏金行业正在发展，对于高影响漏洞的奖励金额也越来越高。例如，苹果现在可以为最严重的漏洞奖励高达100万美元。
### Response Time {#c01.xhtml#h2-123456c01-0011}
Finally, consider the program's average *response time* . Some companies
will handle and resolve your reports within a few days, while others
take weeks or even months to finalize their fixes. Delays often happen
because of the security team's internal constraints, like a lack of
personnel to handle reports, a delay in issuing security patches, and a
lack of funds to timely reward researchers. Sometimes, delays happen
because researchers have sent bad reports without clear reproduction
steps.
最后，请考虑该程序的平均响应时间。有些公司可以在几天内处理和解决您的报告，而另一些公司可能需要数周甚至数月才能完成修复。延迟通常是由于安全团队的内部限制引起的，比如缺乏处理报告的人员、发布安全补丁的延迟以及缺乏及时奖励研究人员的资金。有时，延迟是因为研究人员发送了没有明确重现步骤的错误报告。
Prioritize programs with fast response times. Waiting for responses from
companies can be a frustrating experience, and when you first start,
you're going to make a lot of mistakes. You might misjudge the severity
of a bug, write an unclear explanation, or make technical mistakes in
the report. Rapid feedback from security teams will help you improve,
and turn you into a competent hacker faster.
优先给速度响应快的项目排序。等待公司的回应可能会让你感到沮丧，特别是在你刚开始的时候，你会犯很多错误。你可能会错判一个漏洞的严重程度、写得不清楚或在报告中犯技术错误。安全团队的快速反馈将帮助你提高，并更快地成为一名合格的黑客。
## Private Programs {#c01.xhtml#h1-123456c01-0005}
Most bug bounty platforms distinguish between public and private
programs.
大部分漏洞赏金平台区分公开和私人项目。
*Public programs* are those that are open to all; anyone can hack and
submit bugs to these programs, as long as they abide by the laws and the
bug bounty program's policies.
公共计划是对所有人开放的；只要遵守法律和漏洞赏金计划的政策，任何人都可以黑入并提交漏洞。
On the other hand, *private programs* are open to only invited hackers.
For these, companies ask hackers with a certain level of experience and
a proven track record to attack the company and submit bugs to it.
Private programs are a lot less competitive than public ones because of
the limited number of hackers participating. Therefore, it's much easier
to find bugs in them. Private programs also often have a much faster
response time, because they receive fewer reports on average.
另一方面，私人计划仅向被邀请的黑客开放。对于这些私人计划，公司会邀请具有一定经验和已证明攻击该公司并提交错误的黑客。由于参与黑客的数量有限，私人计划的竞争要少得多。因此，在私人计划中更容易找到错误。私人计划通常也有更快的响应时间，因为它们平均接收到更少的错误报告。
Participating in private programs can be extremely advantageous. But how
do you get invited to one? [Figure
1-1](#c01.xhtml#figure1-1){#c01.xhtml#figureanchor1-1} shows a private
invitation notification on the HackerOne platform.
参与私人计划可以非常有利。但是如何获得邀请呢？图1-1显示了HackerOne平台上的私人邀请通知。
![[Figure 1-1]{#c01.xhtml#figure1-1} : A private invitation notification
on the HackerOne platform. When you hack on a bug bounty platform, you
can often get invites to the private programs of different companies. ¶

Companies send private invites to hackers who have proven their
abilities in some way, so getting invites to private programs isn't
difficult once [ ]{#c01.xhtml#Page_12 .pagebreak title="12"} you've
found a couple of bugs. Different bug bounty platforms will have
different algorithms to determine who gets the invites, but here are
some tips to help you get there.
公司会向已经证明其能力的黑客发送私人邀请，因此一旦你发现了几个漏洞，获得私人计划的邀请并不困难。不同的漏洞赏金平台将有不同的算法来确定谁会获得邀请，但以下是一些提示，可帮助您实现该目标。
First, submit a few bugs to public programs. To get private invites, you
often need to gain a certain number of reputation points on a platform,
and the only way to begin earning these is to submit valid bugs to
public programs. You should also focus on submitting high-impact
vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities will often reward you with higher
reputation points and help you get private invites faster. In each of
the chapters in [ Part II ]{.xref itemid="xref_target_Part II"} of this
book, I make suggestions for how you can escalate the issues you
discover to craft the highest-impact attacks. On some bug bounty
platforms, like HackerOne, you can also get private invites by
completing tutorials or solving Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges.
首先，要提交一些针对公共程序的漏洞。要获得私人邀请，通常需要在平台上获得一定数量的声望点数，而开始获得这些点数的唯一方式就是提交有效的公共程序漏洞。你还应该专注于提交高影响漏洞。这些漏洞通常会奖励你更高的声望点数，并帮助你更快地获得私人邀请。在本书第二部分的每一章中，我都提出建议，让你能够升级你发现的问题，从而制定最高影响的攻击方法。在一些漏洞赏金平台上，比如HackerOne，你还可以通过完成教程或解决Capture
the Flag（CTF）挑战来获得私人邀请。
Next, don't spam. Submitting nonissues often causes a decrease in
reputation points. Most bug bounty platforms limit private invites to
hackers with points above a certain threshold.
接下来，禁止垃圾邮件。经常提交非问题会导致声誉点数下降。大多数漏洞赏金平台将私人邀请限制在具有一定门槛分数以上的黑客。
Finally, be polite and courteous when communicating with security teams.
Being rude or abusive to security teams will probably get you banned
from the program and prevent you from getting private invites from other
companies.
在与安全团队交流时，请最终保持礼貌和谦恭。对安全团队粗鲁或滥用者将有可能导致您被禁止参加计划，并阻止您获得其他公司的私人邀请。
## Choosing the Right Program {#c01.xhtml#h1-123456c01-0006}
Bug bounties are a great way to gain experience in cybersecurity and
earn extra bucks. But the industry has been getting more competitive. As
more people are discovering these programs and getting involved in
hacking on them, it's becoming increasingly difficult for beginners to
get started. That's why it's important to pick a program that you can
succeed in from the very start.
漏洞赏金计划是获得网络安全经验并赚取额外收入的绝佳途径。但是该行业变得越来越竞争。随着越来越多的人发现并参与其中，越来越难让初学者入手了。因此，选择一个能在一开始就成功的计划非常重要。
Before you develop a bug hunter's intuition, you often have to rely on
low-hanging fruit and well-known techniques. This means many other
hackers will be able to find the same bugs, often much faster than you
can. It's therefore a good idea to pick a program that more experienced
bug hunters pass over to avoid competition. You can find these
underpopulated programs in two ways: look for unpaid programs or go for
programs with big scopes.
在你拥有"虫子猎手"的直觉之前，你通常需要依赖易于发现的漏洞和众所周知的技巧。这意味着许多其他黑客可以更快地发现相同的漏洞，甚至比你还要快。因此，选择一些有经验的虫子猎手忽略的程序来避免竞争是个好主意。你可以通过两种方式找到这些少有人参与的程序：寻找未付费的计划或寻找范围大的计划。
Try going for vulnerability disclosure programs first. Unpaid programs
are often ignored by experienced bug hunters, since they don't pay
monetary rewards. But they still earn you points and recognition! And
that recognition might be just what you need to get an invite to a
private, paid program.
试着先参加漏洞披露计划。有偿计划常常被经验丰富的漏洞猎人所重视，而无偿计划则常常被忽略。但是无偿计划依旧可以为您赢得积分和认可！并且可能正是这些认可让您获得邀请参加私人有偿计划的机会。
Picking a program with a large scope means you'll be able to look at a
larger number of target applications and web pages. This dilutes the
competition, as fewer hackers will report on any single asset or
vulnerability type. Go for programs with fast response times to prevent
frustration and get feedback as soon as possible.
选择范围广的项目意味着您可以查看更多的目标应用程序和网页。这会稀释竞争，因为较少的黑客会报告任何单个资产或漏洞类型。选择响应速度快的程序以防止沮丧并尽快获取反馈。
One last thing that you can incorporate into your decision process is
the reputation of the program. If you can, gather information about a [
]{#c01.xhtml#Page_13 .pagebreak title="13"} company's process through
its disclosed reports and learn from other hackers' experiences. Does
the company treat its reporters well? Are they respectful and
supportive? Do they help you learn? Pick programs that will be
supportive while you are still learning, and programs that will reward
you for the value that you provide.
你决策过程中还需要考虑的一件事是项目的声誉。如果可以，通过公开报告收集关于公司的信息，并从其他黑客的经验中学习。公司是否公正尊重举报人？他们是否支持举报人学习？选择那些在你学习时能够提供支持和为你提供价值回报的项目。
Choosing the right program for your skill set is crucial if you want to
break into the world of bug bounties. This chapter should have helped
you sort out the various programs that you might be interested in. Happy
hacking!
选择适合你技能的程序非常关键，如果想要进入漏洞赏金的世界。本章应该帮助你筛选出你可能感兴趣的各种程序。祝你愉快的黑客之旅！
