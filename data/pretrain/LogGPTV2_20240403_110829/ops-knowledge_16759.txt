User: Is there a library for making a screen recorder application in python? i think it would be fun to make somthing like that. but a library that will work on linux im using ubuntu

Assistant: I know of no mechanism to perform screen recording in Python. However, you may be able to use Python to control one of the many existing screen recording programs:

recorditnow
recordmydesktop
byzanz
istanbul
vnc2swf
pyvnc2swf
