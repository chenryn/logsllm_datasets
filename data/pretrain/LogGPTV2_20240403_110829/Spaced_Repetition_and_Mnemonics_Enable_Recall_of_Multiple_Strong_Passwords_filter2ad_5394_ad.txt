TABLE III: NumSurvived(i)/NumSuccessfulReturned(i) with 95% binomial conﬁdence intervals. m = “mnemonic,”
t =“text”
Our second estimate, shown in Figure 8, is quite simple:
(see Figure 9) PessimisticSurvivalEstimate (i) =
ObservedSurvival (i) =
NumSurvived (i)
NumReturned (i)
.
Our ﬁrst estimate could be biased if participants are less
likely to return for future rehearsals whenever they think they
might forget their words. Our second estimate could be biased
if participants were less likely to return for future rehearsal
rounds after previous failures. However, we did not observe
any obvious correlation between prior failure and the return
rate. Sometimes the return rate was higher for participants who
had failed earlier than for participants who had never failed
and sometimes the return rate was lower. Furthermore, in our
survey of participants who did not return in time for a rehearsal
round no one self-reported that they did not return because
they were not conﬁdent that they would be able to remember
(see Section IV-B). Both methods consistently yielded close
estimates.
We also consider a pessimistic estimate of the survival rate
NumSurvived (i)
NumSuccessfulReturned (i) + NumFailed (i)
.
Here, NumFailed (i) counts the number of participants who
failed to remember at
least one of his action-object pairs

management scheme [12]. As we can see from Table III,
most of the participants who did not survive forgot
their
action-object pairs during the ﬁrst rehearsal.
2) Reliable Recall of a Single Password: 100% of par-
ticipants who were asked to memorize one or two PAO
stories (e.g., one password) were able to remember all of
their secret action-object pairs during their ﬁrst eight re-
hearsals over a time period of 63.6 days. 100% of partici-
pants in the m 24hr×2+2start 1 condition also remembered
their PAO story during the ﬁnal rehearsal on day 128. The
95% conﬁdence interval for the fraction of participants in
the m 24hr×2+2start 1 (resp. m 24hr×2+2start 2) condition
who always remember their action-object pairs over 128 days
is [0.918, 1] (resp. [0.673, 0.918]).
3) Effect of Rehearsal: The m 12hr×1.5 condition had the
best survival rate. We used Cox regression to compare the
survival rate for participants in the m 24hr×2, m 12hr×1.5,
m 24hr×2+2start, and m 30min×2 study conditions, using
the m 24hr×2 condition as our baseline. Our results are
three conditions m 12hr×1.5,
shown in Table V. For all
m 24hr×2+2start, and m 30min×2 we have exp (βi) 
for
ObservedSurvival (C2, i2) for C1 = m 24hr×2 and C2 ∈
{ m 12hr×1.5, m 30min×2, m 24hr×2+2start }. We adjusted
the values of i1 and i2 to compare the survival rates over
similar time periods for participants who followed different
rehearsal schedules. In particular, every rehearsal schedule had
one rehearsal near day 64 (e.g., the sixth rehearsal in the
24hr×2 schedule was on day 63 and the eighth rehearsal for the
12hr×1.5 schedule was on day 64.65). Table VIII shows these
results. While the survival rates were lowest in the m 24hr×2
5Because the 30min×2 condition had many rehearsals on day 1 our time
window for participants to return for each of these rehearsals was more narrow
than in other conditions. As a result many participants in this condition were
dropped after day 1 because they were not able to return in a timely manner.
Fig. 10: Survey Results
the time that passes before a failure event (e.g., a user forgets
one of his action-object pairs during a rehearsal) to covariates
(e.g., mnemonic/text, rehearsal schedule, number of words
memorized) that may be associated with this quantity of time.
Cox regression is an appropriate tool for our study because it
can deal with participants who dropped out of the study before
they failed (e.g., participants who did not return for a rehearsal
in a timely manner).
To run Cox regression we need to have the following data
for each participant: whether or not they failed, the time of
failure for participants who did fail and the time a participant
dropped out of the study for participants who were dropped
before their ﬁrst failure. The output of Cox regression is a
set of regression coefﬁcients β1, . . . , βk, which tell us how
different study conditions affect the survival rate compared to
a baseline condition4. For example, suppose that our base-
line condition was the t 24hr×2+2start condition then the
regression coefﬁcient βm would tell us how the survival rate
in the m 24hr×2+2start condition compared to the survival
rate in the t 24hr×2+2start condition. If exp (βm)  1) then participants in the mnemonic condition
are less likely (resp. more likely) to fail at any given time than
participants in the baseline text condition.
D. Findings
1) Reliable Recall of Multiple Passwords: We found
that 82% of participants in the m 12hr×1.5 condition who
were always able to return were able to remember all four
of their secret action-object pairs during all
ten of their
rounds over a time period of 158 days. This

4We use the proportional hazard model to compare the risk of failure for
participants in different study conditions. In particular, given a baseline study
condition we let λ0(t) denote the underlying hazard function — a function
describing the risk that a participant fails to remember his action-object
pairs at time t. Given explanatory variables x1, . . . , xp we use the function
λ (t x1, . . . , xp) = λ0 (t) exp (β1x1 + . . . + βpxp), to compare the risk
for participants in different study conditions and we use Cox regression to
compute the regression coefﬁcients β1, . . . , βp for each explanatory variable.

condition the t-test results were not statistically signiﬁcant at
the α = 0.05 level.
4) Mnemonic vs Text Conditions: We found that partic-
ipants who used the PAO mnemonic technique signiﬁcantly
outperform users who didn’t in recalling their action-object
pairs in the short term. In particular, we used a one-tailed t-
test and tested the hypothesis ObservedSurvival (C1, i1) >
ObservedSurvival (C2, i2) for C1 = m 24hr×2+2start and
C2 = t 24hr×2+2start. We compared our conditions at two
points in time: 63.6 days after memorization (i1 = i2 = 8)
and after the ﬁnal rehearsal 127.6 days after memorization
(i1 = i2 = 9). Table VIII shows these results.
The evidence that participants in m 24hr×2+2start perform
better than participants in t 24hr×2+2start for the ﬁrst 63.6
days after memorization is statistically signiﬁcant (p = 0.010).
However, after the ﬁnal rehearsal (i1 = i2 = 9) the evi-
dence for our hypothesis is no longer statistically signiﬁcant.
Surprisingly, during the last rehearsal round on day 127.6,
participants in the t 24hr×2+2start condition were more likely
to remember their action-object pairs than participants in the
m 24hr×2+2start condition. We also used Cox regression
to compare the survival rates for the t 24hr×2+2start and
m 24hr×2+2start conditions using the m 24hr×2+2start con-
dition as a baseline. Our results are shown in Table VI. We
have exp (βi) > 1 for the t 24hr×2+2start condition, which
indicates that participants did beneﬁt from adopting mnemonic
techniques to memorize their action-object pairs. However,
the hypothesis exp (β1) > 1 (e.g., the survival rate is worse
in the text condition) does not reach the level of statistical
signiﬁcance at the α = 0.05 level. Table VII shows the results
of Cox regression if we only include data from the ﬁrst eight
rehearsal rounds (through day 63.6). In this case the hypothesis
exp (βi) > 1 is statistically signiﬁcant.
5) Effect of Interference: We found that there is an in-
terference effect. Participants performed better when mem-
orizing one or
two PAO stories. We used Cox regres-
sion with the m 24hr×2+2start 4 condition as a baseline
and found statistically signiﬁcant evidence (α < 0.01)
that the survival rate was better in the m 24hr×2+2start 2
condition (exp (βi) = 6.905). Because
