only to view service port statistics for real servers in the partition, and
to disable or re-enable the real servers or their service ports.

show audit
Description Show the command audit log.
Syntax show audit [all-partitions | partition {shared | name}]
Mode All
Usage The audit log is maintained in a separate file, apart from the system log. The audit log mes-
sages that are displayed for an admin depend upon the admin’s privilege level:
• Admins with Root, Read Write, or Read Only privileges who view the audit log can view
all the messages, for all system partitions. To display the messages for a specific parti-
tion only, use the partition option.
• Admins who have privileges only within a specific partition can view only the audit log
messages related to management of that partition. Admins with partition-enable-dis-
able privileges can not view any audit log entries.
Example Below is a sample output of the command audit log (truncated for brevity):
ACOS# show audit
Sep 30 2014 11:54:26 [admin] cli: [172.17.0.224:60009] show audit
