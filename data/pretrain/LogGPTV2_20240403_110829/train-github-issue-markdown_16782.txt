Starting with Release v0.12.0, FancyZones stopped interfering with fullscreen
applications. For ultrawide single-monitor setups, being able to move
fullscreen applications is incredibly useful.
I believe that the fullscreen application moving functionality from v0.11.0
should be added back, but as an additional option in PowerToys settings. For
example,
  * Keep windows in their zones when they are in fullscreen mode
