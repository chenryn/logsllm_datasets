When we create a form that's tied to an entity (meaning we pass an entity to
createForm()), Form->isValid() should not validate the entire entity. Or there
should at least be an option to disable this behavior.
I have my form type and an entity. When there's a direct mapping between the 2
all works well. However, if I add a property to my entity with a constraint,
Form->isValid() calls will fail if the field's value doesn't pass. This means
the form will validate entity fields that aren't a part of the form.
The only solution I've seen posed is to use validation groups on the entity
but this is implying validation rules on my entities that may not be accurate
(perhaps my validation constraints on my entity are all the defaults.
Requiring me to group constraints for form handling in another layer doesn't
seem right). Form validation should validate form fields. If the form wants to
work with entity fields, it would ideally only validate the fields that are
specified in the form (or be configurable).
