User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题how to fix "send-mail: Authorization failed 534 5.7.14 " I am trying to create e-mail alert on ssh root login so I had to install ssmtp and mail utility.

Then I configured ssmtp.conf file as follows :

# Config file for sSMTP sendmail
# The person who gets all mail for userids &lt; 1000
# Make this empty to disable rewriting.
        #root=postmaster
        #Adding  email id to receive system information
root = rootuser@gmail.com
# The place where the mail goes. The actual machine name is required no
# MX records are consulted. Commonly mailhosts are named mail.domain.com
        #mailhub=mail

mailhub = smtp.gmail.com:587

AuthUser=dmymail@gmail.com
AuthPass=plaintext password
UseTLS=YES
UseSTARTTLS=YES

# Where will the mail seem to come from?
rewriteDomain=gmail.com

# The full hostname

hostname = mailserver
# Are users allowed to set their own From: address?
# YES - Allow the user to specify their own From: address
# NO - Use the system generated From: address
FromLineOverride=YES


as well as revaliases as follows:

# Format:       local_account:outgoing_address:mailhub
# Example: root:your_login@your.domain:mailhub.your.domain[:port]

root:rootuser@gmail.com:smtp.gmail.com:25


and I am getting this error:

send-mail: Authorization failed (534 5.7.14 https://support.google.com/mail/bin/answer.py?answer=78754 ni5sm3908366pbc.83 - gsmtp)
Can't send mail: sendmail process failed with error code 1


but it didn't work.
Please help me to sort out this

Assistant: It may take more than one step to fix this issue


Take the step mentioned earlier.  Log into your google email account and then go to this link: https://www.google.com/settings/security/lesssecureapps and set "Access for less secure apps" to ON.  Test to see if your issue is resolved.  If it isn't resolved, as it wasn't for me, continue to Step #2.
Go to https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6009563 (Titled: "Password incorrect error").  This page says "There are several reasons why you might see a “Password incorrect” error (aka 534-5.7.14) when signing in to Google using third-party apps. In some cases even if you type your password correctly."  This page gives 4 suggestions of things to try.


For me, the first suggestion worked:


Go to https://g.co/allowaccess from a different device you have previously used to access your Google account and follow the instructions.
Try signing in again from the blocked app.


There were three more suggestions on the page given in step #2 but I didn't try them because after going to the redacted link and following the instructions, everything began to work as it should.
