Subject: Typing Conflict After Upgrading `@types/react` and `@types/react-router-dom`

Hello,

I recently upgraded the `@types/react` package from version `^16.0.1` to `^16.0.2`. Following this upgrade, I encountered a typing conflict with `@types/react-router-dom` version `^4.0.7`.

Here are the details of my environment:
- **Create React App (CRA)**: Using the latest version of `react-scripts-ts`.
- **TypeScript Compiler (tsc)**: Version `2.4.2`, as provided by `react-scripts-ts`.

The specific error message I am encountering is as follows:

```
.../node_modules/@types/react-router-dom/node_modules/@types/react/index.d.ts
(3558,13): error TS2403: Subsequent variable declarations must have the same type.
Variable 'td' must be of type 'DetailedHTMLProps<TableCellHTMLAttributes<HTMLTableDataCellElement>, HTMLTableDataCellElement>', but here has type 'DetailedHTMLProps<TableCellHTMLAttributes<HTMLTableDataCellElement>, HTMLTableDataCellElement>'.
```

I would appreciate any assistance in resolving this issue. If you need more information or context, please let me know.

Thank you for your help.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
