Hello,
I just upgraded my `@types/react` from `^16.0.1` to `^16.0.2` and now I'm
seeing this typing conflict with `@types/react-router-dom` version `^4.0.7`. I
am using CRA with the latest `react-scripts-ts` which I believe uses `tsc`
version `2.4.2`
    .../node_modules/@types/react-router-dom/node_modules/@types/react/index.d.ts
    (3558,13): error TS2403: Subsequent variable declarations must have the same type.  Variable 'td' must be of type 'DetailedHTMLProps, HTMLTableDataCellElement>', but here has type 'DetailedHTMLProps, HTMLTableDataCellElement>
