User: In Sublime, we have an easy and convent way to run Python or almost any language for that matter using âŒ˜ + b (or ctrl + b)
Where the code will run in a small window below the source code and can easily be closed with the escape key when no longer needed.
Is there a way to replicate this functionally with Github's atom editor?
Assistant: There is a package called "platformio-ide-terminal" that allows you to run Atom code with Ctrl + Shift + B". That's the only package you need (Windows).
