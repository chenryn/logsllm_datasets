User: According to the following requirements, design an efficient load balancing solution to ensure high availability and stable performance of the system. The company has a web application with more than 500,000 user visits during the peak period every day, and the actual load needs to be balanced to multiple servers. It is required that the load of each server cannot exceed 80%, and the system needs to ensure high availability and avoid single point of failure.
Assistant: An efficient load balancing solution is as follows: 1. Use multiple physical servers or virtual servers to host web applications, and each server has the same configuration to ensure that the performance of each server can be fully utilized during load balancing. 2. Use a load balancer to distribute traffic and achieve load balancing. You can choose a hardware load balancer, such as F5, or a software load balancer, such as Nginx, Haproxy, etc. 3. Session retention can be configured on the load balancer to ensure that user session information is not lost and avoid delays and instability caused by frequent cross-server access. 4. You can use an automatic expansion solution, such as using cloud servers to host web applications, and automatically increase the number of servers during peak hours to ensure sufficient performance to handle user access requests. 5. Use the monitoring system to track the load of the server, find the server with high load in time, and perform load balancing to ensure that the load of each server does not exceed 80%. If a server fails, failover can be performed on the load balancer to ensure high availability of the system.
