Like we have in the default calculator app, an option to keep the calculator
window always on top.
Similarly for the other apps by adding an extra button on the left of the
window minimize button or somewhere in the title bar.
Or by simply giving a custom shortcut key for that.
** Also, it will be better if the window of that specific app snaps directly
into a particular area, just like the calculator app does.
