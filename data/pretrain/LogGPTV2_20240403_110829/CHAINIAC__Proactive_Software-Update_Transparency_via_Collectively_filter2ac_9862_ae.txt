of witnesses, by running experiments on real-world data
from Debian. Furthermore, we have replayed 30 days of
actual client requests to the PyPI repository and shown
that the use of skipchains limits the veriﬁcation overhead.
Acknowledgments
We thank Stevens Le Blond and our anonymous reviewers
for valuable suggestions, and Gaspard Zoss for help with
the experiments.
