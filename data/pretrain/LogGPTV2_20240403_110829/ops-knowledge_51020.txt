**User:**
Is it possible to check if a file is done copying or if it is complete using Python? Or even on the command line?

I manipulate files programmatically in a specific folder on macOS, but I need to ensure that the file is fully copied before running the code that performs the manipulation.

**Assistant:**
To determine if a file is completely copied, you can use several methods in both Python and the command line. Here are two approaches:

1. **Compare File Sizes:**
   If you know the source and destination of the file, you can compare the sizes of the original and the copied file. Once the sizes match, the copy is likely complete.

2. **Monitor File Size Stability:**
   Another method is to monitor the size of the file over a short period. If the file size remains unchanged for a few seconds, it is probably finished copying. However, this method may not be reliable for slow network connections.

Here’s a brief example in Python to check if a file's size has stabilized:

```python
import os
import time

def is_file_complete(file_path, interval=5, max_attempts=3):
    initial_size = -1
    for _ in range(max_attempts):
        current_size = os.path.getsize(file_path)
        if current_size == initial_size:
            return True
        initial_size = current_size
        time.sleep(interval)
    return False

# Example usage
file_path = '/path/to/your/file'
if is_file_complete(file_path):
    print("File is complete.")
else:
    print("File is still being copied.")
```

For the command line, you can use a similar approach with a script like:

```sh
#!/bin/bash

FILE_PATH="/path/to/your/file"
INTERVAL=5
MAX_ATTEMPTS=3

initial_size=-1
for ((i=0; i<MAX_ATTEMPTS; i++)); do
    current_size=$(stat -c%s "$FILE_PATH")
    if [ "$current_size" -eq "$initial_size" ]; then
        echo "File is complete."
        exit 0
    fi
    initial_size=$current_size
    sleep $INTERVAL
done

echo "File is still being copied."
exit 1
```

These scripts will help you ensure that the file is fully copied before proceeding with further manipulations.
