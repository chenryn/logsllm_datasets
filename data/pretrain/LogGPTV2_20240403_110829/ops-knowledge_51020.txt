User: is it possible to check if a file is done copying of if its complete using python?
or even on the command line.
i manipulate files programmatically in a specific folder on mac osx but i need to check if the file is complete before running the code which makes the manipulation.
Assistant: If you know where the files are being copied from, you can check to see whether the size of the copy has reached the size of the original.
Alternatively, if a file's size doesn't change for a couple of seconds, it is probably done being copied, which may be good enough.  (May not work well for slow network connections, however.)
