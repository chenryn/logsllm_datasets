User: Is there some way to read the PID of a process started with QProcess.start(...)? QProcess::pid() returns sip.voidptr and there's not much I can do with it (or I don't know how).
I want to have the PID to have the possibility to make the window active later on.
Assistant: pid() function is provided to keep old source code working.
Use processId() instead.
Returns the native process identifier for the running process, if available. If no process is currently running, 0 is returned.
Note: Unlike processId(), pid() returns an integer on Unix and a pointer on Windows.
