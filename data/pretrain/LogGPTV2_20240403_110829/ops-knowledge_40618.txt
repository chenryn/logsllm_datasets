User: I tried to learn shell(bash) scripting few times but was driven away by the syntax. Then I found Python and was able to do most of the things a shell script can do in Python. I am now not sure whether I should invest my time in learning shell scripting anymore. So I want to ask:
What are strengths of shell scripting that make it an indispensable tool as compared to Python?
I am not a system administration by profession, but I am interested in setting up Linux systems for home users, hence I think learning shell scripting can become necessary.
Assistant: one doesn't have to learn shell scripting, as all the previous answers indicate; but learning is never a bad thing. it's really a question of personal priorities. it's very hard for someone else to tell you what is and isn't worth your time.
most programmers find that learning new languages gets incrementally easier each time. (the same is largely true of natural languages too.) and the earlier you start, the better.
plus: having learned a language enables you to extravagantly diss its limitations from a position of complete knowledge and familiarity. this probably won't get you laid, but might earn you a beer from your peers!
