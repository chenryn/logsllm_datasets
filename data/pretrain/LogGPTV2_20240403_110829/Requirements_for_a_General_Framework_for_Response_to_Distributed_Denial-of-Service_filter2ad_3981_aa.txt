## Abstract
This research project investigates the nature of network denial of service (DoS) and its implications. The paper explores whether DoS can be eliminated, detected, and if network systems can adequately respond when subjected to such attacks. It highlights the challenges that make DoS a difficult security problem and discusses solutions proposed by the security research community. The paper also provides a classification of DoS into the Consumer and Producer problems, which are prevalent in modern network incidents. Finally, it proposes requirements for a framework to manage responses to DoS incidents and suggests future directions for developing this framework.

## 1. Introduction and Background
In February 2000, the Internet experienced a significant distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack, which brought stark realities to the e-commerce community. Small hosts targeted large, supposedly well-protected systems, leading to an unprecedented incident in computer security literature. The response was ad hoc, revealing a lack of preparation. The involved entities operated under different policies and systems, complicating the situation further.

According to the joint CSI/FBI report [25-26], DoS incidents are a growing concern. In 1999, 25% of surveyed companies reported DoS attacks, increasing to 27% in 2000. Experts like Cohen [5] predicted that DCA incidents would become more common, a prediction that has held true.

Denial of service is essentially a problem where an entity within a system prevents authorized entities from accessing resources. In conventional security models, DoS is considered an availability issue. However, it can also be an integrity problem if unauthorized modifications compromise the service. Despite various proposed solutions, no method guarantees 100% service and security due to the broad problem domain and limitations of current infrastructures.

With the growth of distributed systems, DDoS has evolved, impacting millions of people. This research project aims to develop a general framework to address this problem, which currently lacks credible solutions. Section two describes the difficulties of the DoS problem, section three classifies the types of DoS incidents, and section four proposes a framework for managing responses. The paper concludes with a summary and future work in section five.

## 2. Literature Review
### 2.1 Distributed Co-ordinated Attack Incidents
Cohen [5] discussed the challenges of DCAs, emphasizing the primary issue of trust. Network infrastructures are untrustworthy, and even with reliable technology, the human element remains a vulnerability. Tracing an attack through multiple administrative systems is complicated, as cooperation from all systems is required.

Cohen noted that a single individual need not perpetrate these attacks, and tracing the source is a painstaking task. He suggested strong filtering but did not propose specific response strategies beyond this.

### 2.2 Distributed Denial of Service Incidents
In the late 1990s, DDoS became a significant concern for network security professionals. Unlike DCAs, DDoS does not require complex coordination between attackers. A single attacker can distribute and direct attacks using 'Trojan Horse' programs, which do not damage the penetrated systems. These 'Zombie' machines launch large volumes of traffic at the target upon a signal from the attacker.

Geng et al. [24] suggested creating economic and technical expenses for 'Zombie' systems to incentivize better security. Technical solutions include solving mathematical problems before making connections or limiting the number of transactions. Non-technical solutions include charging hosts for sending transactions, similar to an electronic postal service, to reduce unnecessary network costs.

### 2.3 Ingress/Egress Filtering
The Internet Society [11] recommended ingress filtering to remove spoofed addresses. This technique, implemented by upstream service providers, removes packets with illegal addresses. While effective against older attacks, it does not eliminate DDoS, as tools analyzed by Dettrich [6-8] do not require spoofed addresses.

### 2.4 Network Security Group UC Davis
The UC Davis group focused on protecting network routers from DoS incidents, identifying the importance of cooperation within the network environment. They developed the WATCHERS protocol, which requires strict adherence to prevent coordinated attacks. However, this approach may not be suitable for all network participants and is more appropriate for restricted environments.

### 2.5 Summary
The primary issue for the Internet is trust, or more specifically, the lack thereof. The next sections will delve into the detailed classification of DoS incidents and propose a framework for managing responses to these incidents.
