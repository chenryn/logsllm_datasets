It would be great if there was a way to relax the current constraint of
requiring get/set accessors to have the same type. this would be helpful in a
situation like this:
    class MyClass {
        private _myDate: moment.Moment;
        get myDate(): moment.Moment {
            return this._myDate;
        }
        set myDate(value: Date | moment.Moment) {
            this._myDate = moment(value);
        }
    }
Currently, this does not seems to be possible, and I have to resort to
something like this:
    class MyClass {
        private _myDate: moment.Moment;
        get myDate(): moment.Moment {
            return this._myDate;
        }
        set myDate(value: moment.Moment) {
            assert.fail('Setter for myDate is not available. Please use: setMyDate() instead');
        }
        setMyDate(value: Date | moment.Moment) {
            this._myDate = moment(value);
        }
    }
This is far from ideal, and the code would be much cleaner if different types
would be allowed.
Thanks!
