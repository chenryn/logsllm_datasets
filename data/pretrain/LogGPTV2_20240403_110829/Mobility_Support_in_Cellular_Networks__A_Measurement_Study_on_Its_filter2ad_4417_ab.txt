### Active-State and Idle-State Handoffs
Active-state and idle-state handoffs differ in their procedures. In an active-state handoff:
1. The device measures the radio signal strength of neighboring cells.
2. When the reporting criterion is met (e.g., a candidate cell's radio signal strength is offset stronger than the serving cell's), the device reports its measurement results to the serving cell.
3. The serving cell then decides whether to switch to a new cell and which cell to switch to.

In an idle-state handoff:
1. The device measures the radio signal strength of neighboring cells.
2. The device makes a decision locally using pre-configured decision criteria.
3. The cell switches from the serving cell (S) to the target cell (T) under network-device cooperation.

### Policy-Based Configurations
Cellular networks use policy-based handoffs, considering factors such as cell priorities, radio link quality, and lists of eligible candidate cells. According to standard specifications, our measurement study covers 66 parameters for a single 4G LTE cell and 91 parameters for four 3G/2G RATs. Due to space limitations, we focus on the main parameters for 4G LTE (Table 2).

#### Measurement
- **Types of Measurements**: 
  - **Intra-Frequency (M1)**: Measures the radio signal strength of cells on the same frequency.
  - **Non-Intra-Frequency (M2)**: Measures the radio signal strength of cells on different frequencies or RATs.
- **Measurement Trigger**: 
  - If \( r_S \leq \Theta_{\text{intra}} \) (or \( \Theta_{\text{nonintra}} \)), the corresponding measurement is triggered.
  - Otherwise, only higher-priority cells are measured periodically (every \( T_{\text{higher Meas}} \) seconds).
- **Signal Quality Metrics**: 
  - **RSRP (Reference Signal Received Power)**: Range (-140 dBm, -44 dBm)
  - **RSRQ (Reference Signal Received Power Quality)**: Range (-19.5 dB, -3 dB)
- **Calibration**: Compensates for different transmission powers and ensures fair radio signal comparison. Converts actual measurement \( \bar{r}_S \) into a calibrated value \( r_S = \bar{r}_S - \Delta_{\text{min}} \).

#### Reporting
- **Reporting Events**: 
  - **A1-A5, B1, B2**: Each event targets a specific condition and has its own configuration set (thresholds \( \Theta_e \), hypotheses \( H_e \), and offsets \( \Delta_e \)).
  - **A3 Example**: 
    - **Reporting Condition**: \( r_c > r_s + \Delta_{A3} + H_{A3} \)
    - **Stopping Condition**: \( r_c \leq r_s + \Delta_{A3} + H_{A3} \)

#### Decision
- **Decision Criteria**:
  - **Higher-Priority Cells**: Switch if the candidate cell's signal strength exceeds the serving cell's by a certain threshold.
  - **Equal-Priority Cells**: Use offsets to compare signal strengths.
  - **Lower-Priority Cells**: Switch if the serving cell's signal strength falls below a certain threshold and the candidate cell's signal strength exceeds another threshold.

### MMLab Tool Design
To conduct large-scale handoff configuration studies, we designed MMLab, a software tool that runs on Android phones. MMLab:
- **Crawls Configuration Data**: Extracts handoff configurations from signaling messages.
- **Runs Performance Assessments**: Conducts performance evaluations without operator assistance.
- **Crowdsourced Infrastructure**: Relies on global volunteers to collect configuration traces from operators worldwide.
- **Proactive Cell Switching**: Enables automated switching of the serving cell to collect configurations from multiple cells at a given location.

### Measurement Flow
Using MMLab, we conduct two types of measurements:
- **Type-I (Configuration Collection)**: Large-scale data collection from 32,000+ cells.
- **Type-II (Performance Assessment)**: Small-scale experiments to assess the impact of specific configurations.
