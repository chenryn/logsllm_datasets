##### ISSUE TYPE
  * Bug Report
##### COMPONENT NAME
lineinfile
##### ANSIBLE VERSION
    [See issue #16596](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/16596)
##### CONFIGURATION
##### OS / ENVIRONMENT
##### SUMMARY
This bug still exists in version 2.2. The original bug report was closed in
July 2016 due to the old module bug reporting policy that bugs for modules are
reported at https://github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-core. That repository
is now closed for bug reports as of Dec 2016 and requests bugs to be submitted
to this repository. (See the last comment on this bug report for an example).
Additionally, a response to issue #16596 that the bug was already reported is
incorrect. Issue #16596 deals with quantifiers in regular expressions not
working as advertised. The supposedly duplicate bug report deals with
lineinfile adding a line when the regex is not found. Closing issue reporting
for a repo without also migrating the open issues to the new reporting site
does not make those issues go away.
