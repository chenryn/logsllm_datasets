### Bug Report

#### Component
- `lineinfile` module

#### Ansible Version
- [Refer to issue #16596](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/16596)

#### Configuration
- Not provided

#### Operating System / Environment
- Not provided

#### Summary
This bug, which was previously reported and closed in July 2016, still persists in version 2.2. The original bug report was closed due to the old module bug reporting policy, which directed users to report bugs for modules at https://github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-core. However, as of December 2016, that repository is no longer accepting new bug reports, and all future reports should be submitted to this repository.

Additionally, a response to issue #16596 stating that the bug was already reported is incorrect. Issue #16596 specifically addresses the problem with quantifiers in regular expressions not functioning as expected. In contrast, the supposedly duplicate bug report deals with the `lineinfile` module adding a line when the regex is not found. Closing the issue reporting for a repository without migrating open issues to the new reporting site does not resolve these issues.
