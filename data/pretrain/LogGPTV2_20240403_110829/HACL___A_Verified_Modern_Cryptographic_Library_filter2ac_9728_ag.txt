### OpenSSL Speed Comparison for Various Cryptographic Algorithms

#### Table 8: Performance Metrics for Different Algorithms

The following table compares the performance of several cryptographic algorithms, including ChaChaPoly, SHA-256, SHA-512, Poly1305, and Curve25519. Each algorithm was run repeatedly for three seconds on different input sizes, and the number of bytes processed per second was measured using the `openssl speed` command. The experiments were conducted on an Intel Core i7 @ 2.2 GHz running macOS 10.12.4. For Curve25519, the number of ECDH computations per second was measured.
