User: I'm working on a project utilizing Django on Google App Engine.  I've been asked if some of the code can be deployed as compiled only.
So I guess the question is can I upload a .pyc file only that contains the piece of code in question?  I've done a basic test with a views.pyc file in an application and things don't work.  Is there some configuration or other that I can set to allow Google App Engine to just use the .pyc files?
Assistant: No, you can't - you can only upload sourcecode. There's no good reason to do this, though: your code will be bytecode-compiled on the servers when needed, and nobody is able to access your code in any case.
