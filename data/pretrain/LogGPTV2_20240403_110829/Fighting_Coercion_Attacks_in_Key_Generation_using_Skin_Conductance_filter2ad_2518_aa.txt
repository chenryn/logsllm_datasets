Abstract
Many techniques have been proposed to generate keys
including text passwords, graphical passwords, biomet-
ric data and etc. Most of these techniques are not resis-
tant to coercion attacks in which the user is forcefully
asked by an attacker to generate the key to gain access to
the system or to decrypt the encrypted ﬁle. We present
a novel approach in generating cryptographic keys to
ﬁght against coercion attacks. Our novel technique in-
corporates the user’s emotional status, which changes
when the user is under coercion, into the key generation
through measurements of the user’s skin conductance.
We present a model that generates cryptographic keys
with one’s voice and skin conductance. In order to ex-
plore more, a preliminary user study with 39 subjects was
done which shows that our approach has moderate false-
positive and false-negative rates. We also present the at-
tacker’s strategy in guessing the cryptographic keys, and
show that the resulting change in the password space un-
der such attacks is small.
1 Introduction
Many techniques have been proposed to generate strong
cryptographic keys for secure communication and au-
thentication. Some of these techniques, e.g., those us-
ing biometrics [15, 24, 27, 28, 35], offer desirable secu-
rity properties including ease of use, unforgettability, un-
forgeability (to some extent), high entropy and etc. How-
ever, most of these schemes are not resistant to coercion
attacks in which the user is forcefully asked by an at-
tacker to reveal the key [32]. When the user’s life is
threatened by an attacker, one would have to surrender
the key, and the system will be compromised despite all
the security properties described above. In this paper, we
present a novel approach to protection against coercion
attacks in generating keys.
For a cryptographic key generation technique to be co-
ercion attack resistant, it is required that when the user
is under coercion, he/she will have no way of generat-
ing the key, or the key generated will never be the same
as the one generated when he/she is not being coerced.
If this requirement is met, then an adversary would not
apply any threat to him/her because the adversary under-
stands that the user would not be able to generate the key
when he is threatened to do so. Here we assume that the
coercion resistance property is publicly known to every-
one, including the attackers; otherwise it might lead to
a dangerous situation for the user, a problem we do not
address in this paper.
To show how desirable it is to have a coercion-resistant
cryptographic key generation technique, here we list a
few scenarios in which such a technique could be useful:
• Bank’s vault and safe: According to statistics re-
leased by the FBI [17], there were 1, 094 reported
robberies (out of which 58 cases were of vault/safe
robberies) of commercial banks between July 1,
2009 and September 30, 2009 totaling more than
$9.4 million.
If such systems are used to ﬁght
against these attacks, then managers will never be
forced to open the vault.
• Cockpit doors on airliners: The hijackers of the
September 11, 2001 use the fueled aircraft as a mis-
sile to destroy ground targets. If the cockpit doors
on airliners are well equipped with coercion resisted
techniques, then hijackers can never force a ﬂight
attendant to open the door.
• Secret/capability holders in a war: secret and ca-
pability holders would not be forced to reveal the
secret or use the capability.
In this paper, we explore the incorporation of user’s
emotional status (through the measure of skin conduc-
tance) into the process of key generation to achieve co-
ercion resistance. We demonstrate this possibility by in-
corporating skin conductance into a previously proposed
key generation technique using biometrics [24] (see Fig-
ure 1).
Figure 1: Coercion attacks in key generation
Incorporating skin conductance information into key
generation is nontrivial. First, the fact that a change in a
user’s emotional status leads to changes in a user’s skin
conductance does not necessarily mean that our proposed
technique is coercion resistant. If known patterns exist
in such changes, an attacker might be able to guess the
skin conductance of the user when he is not nervous by,
e.g., ﬂipping a few bits of the feature key (see Section 4)
generated from the skin conductance of the user when he
is nervous. We analyze this attack and its consequences,
and show that the reduction in password space is small.
Second, we hope that the key generation algorithm
will take in the least amount of user speciﬁc informa-
tion except the live data collected when it is used. This is
because the key generation algorithm might be executed
from the client’s machine, and the inputs to the algorithm
could potentially be retrieved by the attacker during a
coercion attack. However, when dealing with biomet-
rics data, removing such user speciﬁc information from
the inputs of the algorithm is not plausible, as different
people have different sets of consistent and inconsistent
biometric features. The algorithm would have too high
false-negative rates without this additional user speciﬁc
information. We propose using only user-speciﬁc feature
lookup tables which contain valid key shares or garbage.
We also analyze conceivable attacks that result from our
proposal.
Third, it is nontrivial how a user study can be per-
formed to evaluate our technique. We need to collect bio-
metric data corresponding to different emotional states
of real human beings. Efforts in this area are more de-
manding than traditional efforts to get pattern recogni-
tion data [31]. To analyze the effectiveness of our pro-
posal, we perform a user study to see how one’s skin
conductance changes when he/she is being coerced. This
is used to evaluate the false-positive and false-negative
2
rates of our model, and to analyze the attacker’s strategy
in guessing the cryptographic key. With 39 participants
in our user study, we ﬁnd that our technique enjoys mod-
erate false-positive and false-negative rates in key gen-
eration. Furthermore, we ﬁnd that the reduction in the
password space for an informed attacker is small.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Sec-
tion 2, we discuss some state-of-the-art approaches in
cryptographic key generation and recognition of emo-
tional response. Background knowledge about the cho-
sen biometrics and ﬁngerprint are discussed in Section 3.
In Section 4, we present the details of our approach in
key generation using skin conductance and voice. The
user study and results are presented in Sections 5 and
Section 6 respectively. We conclude in Section 7 with
some plausible future work.
2 Related Work
In this section we review some of the techniques and
methodologies used to generate cryptographic keys from
biometrics and some previous work on the emotion
recognition schemes using physiological signals.
Many key generation techniques from biometrics, e.g.,
voice, iris, face, ﬁngerprints, keystroke dynamics, and
etc., have been proposed in the last decade [15, 24, 27,
28, 35]. The pioneer work in cryptographic key genera-
tion from behavioral biometrics uses keystroke dynamics
of a user while typing the password [25]. The features
of interest are the duration of keystrokes and the latency
between each pair of keystrokes. The generated crypto-
graphic key is called the hardened password. However
the password generated is not very long and is suscepti-
ble to brute-force attacks [25]. Another method using se-
cret sharing was proposed to generate the biometric key
from voice [24]. The distinguishing biometric features
are selected based on the separation between the authen-
tic and the imposter data, and then binarized by some
thresholds. However, this method is not resistant to coer-
cion attacks (which our proposed model trying to target),
as the attacker can force the user to speak out the pass-
word in a normal way. We will discuss key generation
approach from voice in more detail in the formal frame-
work of our model (see Section 3).
Another work on key generation from voice uses
phonemes instead of words, as it is possible to gener-
ate larger keys with shorter sequences [15]. Using the
information of the voice model and the phoneme infor-
mation of the segments, a set of features are created to
train an SVM (Support Vector Machine) that could gen-
erate a cryptographic key. False-positives and entropy of
the system were not demonstrated, which does not give a
clear picture of the security of the scheme.
There are many risk and security concerns over bio-
metric systems [32, 33, 40]. Some of the threat mod-
els include fake biometrics at the sensor, tampering with
the stored templates, coercion attacks. Biometrics live-
ness detection is proposed to thwart fake biometrics at-
tacks, e.g., by using perspiration in the skin [1] or blood
ﬂow [22]. However, no previous work has been proposed
to resist coercion attacks in generating cryptographic
keys using biometrics. There have been suggestions like
panic alarm or duress code to ﬁght against coercion at-
tacks, but they are different from what we are propos-
ing here because in previous schemes users choose not
to generate the key but to send a signal to authorities
without catching the adversary’s attention, whereas in
our scheme we require that users simply will not be able
to generate the key.
It is clear that our scheme offers
much stronger security properties.
Previous work also shows that emotion recognition us-
ing physiological signals, affects from speech, and facial
expressions have various success rates between 60% and
98% [31]. Although many techniques have been pro-
posed for emotion recognition [31, 20, 29, 21], none has
looked into the incorporation of emotional status into key
generation as what we propose in this paper.
3 Background
In this section, we present some background knowledge
of voice and skin conductance, and discuss why in future
an addition of ﬁngerprint in our model would be better
as an authentication measure for the protection against
coercion attack. We also discuss the reasons for the se-
lection of these features and the advantages over others
in terms of acceptability, feasibility and usability.
3.1 Why Skin Conductance?
An emotion is a mental and physiological state associ-
ated with a wide variety of feelings, thoughts, and be-
havior. Emotions are subjective experiences, often as-
sociated with mood, temperament, personality, and dis-
position [11]. This emotional behavioral change is the
key component in our model in ﬁghting against coer-
cion attack. Several physiological peripheral activities
have been found to be related to emotional processing of
situations. Many physiological parameters were studied
for emotion recognition, e.g., heart beat rate [3] (HR),
skin conductance [23] (SC), EMG (Electromyography)
signals, ECG (Electrocardiography) signals, body tem-
perature, BVP (Blood Volume Pulse) signals, and etc.,
among which HR and SC are especially attractive due to
their strong association with behavioral activation sys-
tem (BAS) and behavioral inhibition system (BIS) re-
spectively [14].
SC is the change in the electrical properties of an in-
dividual person’s skin caused by an interaction between
environmental events and the individual psychological
state. Human skin is a good conductor of electricity and
when subject to a weak electrical current, a change in the
skin conductance level occurs [42]. We chose SC over
HR for the following reasons.
1. The skin conductance is one of the fastest respond-
ing measures of stress response [16]. It is one of the
most robust and non-invasive physiological mea-
sures of autonomic nervous system activity [7]. Re-
searchers have linked skin conductance response to
stress and autonomic nervous system arousal [37].
2. The change in HR not only accounts for stress but
for many other reasons, including jogging or doing
some heavy work load. SC, on the other hand, has
been shown to be a promising measure in experi-
mental studies [36] for its reliability.
3. According to [41], HR is also impacted when stress
levels rise but the shifts take a bit of time to happen
and by the time the changes are noticeable the trig-
gering stimulus is long past, whereas SC responses
are rapid and easy to measure.
4. HR is not suitable to our model due to prevail-
ing feasibility issues. HR can be measured using
an Electrocardiogram (ECG) machine or a stetho-
scope. Using an ECG machine is impractical be-
cause it is very cumbersome due to many (at least
three) electrodes required and installation costs [6].
Stethoscope is not good either because different
placements of the stethoscope could lead to high
FTC rate (failure to capture rate) [30].
5. Using SC has an extra advantage as it can be mea-
sured simultaneously while ﬁngerprints are being
scanned. This ensures that SC is measured from
the authentic person (more on this in the coming
subsection). The wide acceptance of ﬁnger scan-
ning [18, 39] also suggest that SC measurement
would have the potential to gain user acceptance.
There are some limitations of using skin conductance as
with any other biometric. Some skin lotions can be used
to manipulate the skin conductance level. In a test done
by [34], the usage of speciﬁc solutions produced signif-
icant increase in skin water content, and was indicated
by increase in skin conductance level. According to the
product after the application of the cream by EncoSkin,
skin moisture level can be signiﬁcantly increased which
can be monitored by skin conductance [12].

3.2 Why Voice?
Voice has been used previously to generate cryptographic
keys [15, 24]. Voice as a biometric is desirable for gener-
ating keys for two important reasons. First, it is the most
familiar way of communication, which makes it ideal for
many applications. Second, voice is a dynamic biometric
and is not static like iris or ﬁngerprint. A user can have
different keys for different accounts by just changing the
password (what to pronounce) or the vocalization of the
same password (how to pronounce) to generate differ-
ent cryptographic keys. In an event of key compromise a
new cryptographic key can be easily generated. Note that
voice has a potential disadvantage when used in ﬁghting
against coercion, namely that the attacker may blame the
user for intentionally pronouncing the wrong password.
We demonstrated our technique with voice; however, our
scheme is not limited to using voice, other biometric can
be used as well.
3.3 Why Fingerprint?
A potential threat to our biometric system is to use spo-
ken password from the genuine user (under stress) and
SC responses from another person (normal emotional
state). To ensure that SC is not unforgeable, one can
make use of a device to collect ﬁngerprint and skin con-
ductance of the user at the same time so that the ﬁnger-
print of the user can be checked and mapped to his/her
skin conductance signal. However, we did not demon-
strate how to use this as a measure in our proposed model
as this is not the contribution of this paper and is left for
the future work.
4 Key Generation from Voice and Skin
Conductance
In order to show how skin conductance can be used to
ﬁght against coercion attacks in cryptographic key gen-
eration, in this section, we present the details of a cryp-
tographic key generation technique using voice and skin
conductance. Note the criteria behind choosing skin con-
ductance and voice in Section 3. Other biometrics in lieu
of voice could be used as well. Our way of using voice is
similar (with some differences) to an earlier proposal of
generating cryptographic keys using voice [24]. Table 1
shows some notations used in the rest of this paper.
4.1 An Overview
Inputs to our model include the voice captured when the
user utter the password into the microphone and the skin
conductance measured. Figure 2 shows the input devices
Figure 2: Input devices
we used in our experimental setup. Output of our model
is a cryptographic key generated.
In the ﬁrst phase (Figure 3 (a)–(h)), features ex-
tracted from the spoken password are used to generate
a sequence of frames fV (1), . . . , fV (n) (3 (c)), from
which an optimal segmentation of s segments (compo-
nent sounds) (3 (f)). The segmentation obtained are then
mapped to the feature descriptor using a random αV
plane (3 (g)). Furthermore, features are also extracted
from the SC sample and the corresponding feature de-
scriptors are computed (3 (h)). These feature descrip-
tors should be “sufﬁciently similar” for the same user and
“sufﬁciently different” for different users. By the end of
the ﬁrst phase, we have feature descriptors for both voice
and SC signal.
In the second phase (Figure 3 (i)–(l)), we perform
lookup table generation and cryptographic key recon-
struction. A total of NV samples from voice and NSC
samples from SC are used to generate lookup tables TV
and TSC . In cryptographic key reconstruction, feature
keys are generated from the spoken password (mV bits)
and SC (mSC bits). The two lookup tables generated
and the features keys are then used to generate the cryp-
tographic key.
In the next two subsections, we will present these two
phases in more detail.
4.2 Phase I: Feature descriptors derivation
4.2.1 Feature descriptors from voice
In the last six decades, speech recognition and speaker
recognition have advanced a lot [8]. A speaker recog-
nition system usually has three modules:
feature ex-
traction, pattern matching and decision making, among
which feature extraction is especially important to our
research as it estimates a set of features from the speech
signal that represent the speaker-speciﬁc information.
These features should be consistent for each speaker and
should not change over time. The way we extract these
features and derive the feature descriptors is very simi-
lar to the previous approach [24], except that we use the
