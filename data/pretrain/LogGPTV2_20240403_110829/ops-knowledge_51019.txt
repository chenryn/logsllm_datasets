User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How can I manage apt efficiently on multiple machines? I manage around 30 Ubuntu servers using puppet.  I've seen many references to cron-apt and apticron as approaches to keeping their packages up to date but I haven't been able to find a way to centrally manage the process.  With cront-apt/apticron I would still need to log in to each host and run aptitude update to perform the update.  Not to mention review notifications from all 30 machines whenever a core package is updated.

There has to be a better way.  Any suggestions?

Assistant: A co-worker discovered and has looked briefly into apt-dater, which is a &quot;terminal-based remote package update manager&quot;.
You use a curses-based interface to manage updates on all of your hosts, or groups of hosts, etc. Supports logging of the full apt session, including any errors that may be encountered, etc.
Relies on ssh and sudo on the managed machines.

Haven't used it myself, so I can't endorse it, but it sounds close to what you're looking for.
