of a good path) or poor policy (choosing a poor path). Obvi-
ously, anycast routes will also be subject to similar inflation.
Measurements of AS path inference to unicast representa-
tives allow us to understand if anycast is subject to additional
path inflation.
Consider the scenario shown in Figure 7, which is derived
from a real example in our dataset. Figure 7 shows a RIPE At-
las probe outside Tokyo, Japan, trying to connect to a replica
for D-root. D-root hosts a global site in Tokyo; however,
there is no short route (that does not traverse the United
States) from the probe IP address to the D-root replica there.
In this instance, anycast routes the probe to a D-root site
in Los Angeles, CA. However, there is a unicast route from
the probe to a site in Singapore, and that site is closer than
Los Angeles in both latency and distance. In this example,
the extra distance from Tokyo to Singapore can be consid-
ered unicast path inflation. (It is difficult to believe that no
(perhaps policy-violating) path exists between the source
and Tokyo-based replica.) However, the latency difference
between probe–Singapore versus probe–Los Angeles is due
anycast path inflation. Anycast path inflation quantifies the

unicast and anycast path inflation. For C-root, we collected
traceroutes from 1,862 probes that had such potential, and
1,541 of them have all complete traceroutes; for D-root, we
collected traceroutes from 3,570 probes and 2,785 gave us
complete traceroutes; for K-root, we collected traceroutes
from 2,886 probes and 1,398 of them were complete.
We interpret the measurements as follows. If the measured
RTT to the geographically closest site, Gs→a, is less than
that predicted by distance (using the Htrae constant [1],
0.0269 msec/mile) to the second closest site G′, assume L = G.
This chooses the geographically closest as the lowest-latency
replica if the second closest is unlikely to be any better.
If C is already the second closest replica G′, assume L is
either C or G, whichever is less. Otherwise, we will measure
the latency to the second closest replica and set L to the least
of C, G or G′. In some cases, we may choose to include a
third-closest popular replica that still is within a distance
that could yield a reduction in latency.
With the latencies to C, G and L, we compute anycast path
inflations and compare to unicast path inflations. Anycast
path inflation quantifies the extra latency or distance when
anycast does not choose the best unicast path. We compute
anycast path inflation as the difference in round trip time
between C and L, where round trip time to C is at least as
large as the round trip time to the site with the lowest latency
L. The available paths to different replicas (or representaties)
have already been filtered based on BGP routing policies and
thus experience unicast path inflations. Typical, unicast path
inflation from BGP is captured by the difference between the
round trip time to L and the predicted round trip time, by
distance, to G.
Figure 8 presents unicast and anycast path inflation for
1,541 probes for C-, 2,785 for D-, and 1,398 for K-roots. For D-
and K-root, anycast is unable to use the better unicast paths
that are available, possibly due to route selection policy at
ISPs. This is a counter-intuitive result, because it shows that
extra choices provided by adding anycast sites can decrease
performance, since ISPs may (and do) choose the “wrong”
advertisement out of many available, thereby increasing the
latency to the anycast prefix!
5 POTENTIAL
The previous section shows that anycast routing performs
worse than unicast. ASes do not have sufficient information
to make good selections. Indeed, this hints at an anomaly:
adding replicas can sometimes make anycast routes worse as
ASes pick “worse among equals.” All is not lost, however. In
this section, we show that relatively modest additions to BGP
advertisements that encode static information about replicas
would be sufficient to regain much of the lost performance.
BGP has shown itself to be extensible and can be made to

extra cost incurred by anycast by not choosing paths that
are available via unicast.
4.4 Quantifying anycast path inflation
The task in this section is to quantify how much of the lost
performance in anycast is due to typical unicast path in-
flation, and how much is anycast despite the existence of
a unicast path. We will err on the side of (potentially) un-
derestimating anycast path inflation by sampling candidate
representatives rather than performing an exhaustive mea-
surement from sources to all possible alternate sites or even
to all reasonably close sites.
We first need to determine the latencies to Cs→a, the cho-
sen anycast site, to Gs→a, the geographically closest anycast
site, and to Ls→a, the site reachable with the lowest latency
from s. The first is already obtained by RIPE in the “built-in”
measurement. The second, G, is trivial to determine by trac-
ing to the unicast representative of the nearest site to the
RIPE Atlas probe.
The third, L, is more challenging because exhaustive prob-
ing is not feasible. RIPE Atlas probes are a shared resource
that rate limit measurements and should be used carefully.
The value of additional measurements seemed low: the amount
of anycast path inflation we will see is substantial without
exhaustively seeking optimal.
We focus on probes that choose an anycast site C further
than 500 km beyond the closest, by geography, site, G. That
is, we focus on the queries that have apparent potential to
be improved; for the other queries, they experience little

support this additional information; we prefer a protocol
based solution to one that requires connecting exclusively
to a single large provider.
Derived from the same dataset as in Figure 8, Table 2 lists
the number of probes that were directed to C-, D- and K-root,
the number that were “correctly” routed to lowest latency
sites (“Good”), and what route selection policies cause them
not to. We consider common route selection policies that
routers usually follow: “Valley-Free” 8, “Prefer-Customer,” im-
plying also a preference for peers over providers, and “Prefer
Shortest AS-path.” More detailed route selection policies are
not public for most ISPs. We only consider coarse business re-
lationship (customer, peer, provider) between ASes inferred
from CAIDA’s AS relationship dataset [8]. While it gener-
ally makes sense for some ISPs to apply more detailed route
selection policies to maximize their profits, we believe that
such routing policies are usually applied to routes with sim-
ilar performance (e.g., latency, traffic load, etc.). As shown
in Figure 9, routes with similar preference based on com-
mon routing policies can have very different performance
in anycast. All the probes in the last column (“Unknown
Tie-break”) could have been routed to a better site without
violating the common route selection policies.
Figure 9 shows how much of the anycast path inflation
can be recovered if decision points select routes more in-
telligently.9 The figure shows results for C-, D- and K-root:

extracted from traceroutes.

the anycast path inflation (red) lines correspond to anycast
path inflation (same as Figure 8 and as defined in §4.4). The
“Perfect tie-break” (green) lines correspond to the anycast
path inflation that remains when ASes pick the route to the
best site but still follow the common route selection policies.
The “Ignore AS-path” (blue) lines show anycast path inflation
when ASes pick the route to the best site regardless of the
length of the AS-path in the received BGP advertisements.
Figure 9 and Table 2 are extremely encouraging results:
they show that much of the lost performance can be recov-
ered if ASes select routes more intelligently without violating
common route selection policies. Measurement-based opti-
mization services that select the lowest latency route could
be applied to anycast addresses; although such services exist
for multi-homed ASes to use when choosing providers (e.g.,
Internap Managed Internet Route Optimizer [21].), we do not
assume that their use is (or will be) sufficiently widespread
in the middle of the network to improve anycast.
5.1 Static BGP Hints
Absent explicit measurement-based path selection, even a
static “hint” added to BGP advertisements can prove highly
updated route: either they are also updated to prefer the better route or the
new route with the same next-hop is no less preferable than the old.

beneficial. Consider an extension to BGP in which advertise-
ments for anycast prefixes include the geographic location
of site(s) that are reachable. When selecting routes, ASes can
choose the routes to geographically closest site for each any-
cast prefix. Such an extension can be incrementally deployed,
adds minimal overhead to advertisements, and is computa-
tionally inexpensive to evaluate when picking routes.
Each BGP router would receive advertisements for one or
more sites. Higher precedence rules may cull some adver-
tisements (e.g., an advertisement from a provider AS will be
discarded in favor of advertisements from peers). Among the
remaining, the router will choose the route r that advertises
the geographically closest (remaining) site. If multiple do,
then the router may choose arbitrarily, perhaps by which
advertisement is received first. The router would then in-
clude this route r in its advertisements to BGP neighbors, as
per usual. All traffic destined to the anycast prefix would be
forwarded using route r.
Including explicit information about the approximate lo-
cations of reachable sites generalizes Ballani’s recommenda-
tion [4] in which the anycast operator must cause remote
clients to reach a provider serving all replicas by using only
one upstream provider. Here, we intend to permit ASes to
choose the path that reaches a nearby replica, without dy-
namic measurement and without requiring that the anycast
operator choose a single large provider.
We evaluated our scheme through simulation over the
traceroutes collected in §4.4 to the chosen, geo-closest and
lowest-latency sites. Recall the “decision point” discussion in
§4.2 in which the key task is to find the point of divergence
between the paths to different anycast sites. We consider
which sites would be listed in the BGP advertisements prop-
agated along the routes of the traceroutes, and simulate the
selection of routes that include the closest of the anycast
sites to the decision point (not necessarily the closest to
the source). We use “undns” [51] to track where traceroutes
traversed, and thus infer which sites (among the measured
ones) will be advertised to the decision point. Consider the
example in Figure 7; the decision point between the tracer-
outes to laca and tojp is located at Los Angeles. According to
the geo-hint, the route selected at the decision point should
70
be the one that leads to laca. We then computed the latency
difference between the geo-hinted site and the chosen site.
This evaluation may underestimate the potential benefit be-
cause additional traceroutes could add new decision points
that could expose a route to an even closer site.
Figure 10 shows the performance improvement that traf-
fic destined to C-, D-, and K-root would receive using the
static geographic list. The static hint does no harm to the per-
formance of C-root, which is near ideal. Anycast to D- and
K-root both show dramatic improvement. For D-root, about
1/3 of the probes improve latency by 50 msec; for K-root,
23% do. D-root shows a “step” behavior because it deploys
about 20 global replicas, and for many replicas, the geo-hint
is able to avoid very long latency (cross-continental/cross-
oceanic) links. K-root has more than 50 global replicas, and
the improvements are more evenly distributed.
Note that choosing the route that includes the closest
replica site may not lead to actually using that replica. For
example, should a Florida site be advertised to an AS in South
America and be chosen as the path having the geographically
closest site, the lowest-latency replica may not in fact be the
one in Florida if paths traverse, say, Texas or Virginia along
the way. In this way, the geographic list, at least as we have
evaluated it with a single decision point, may choose the G
