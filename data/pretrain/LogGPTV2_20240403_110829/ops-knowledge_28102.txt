User: Please list commonly used Linux server monitoring tools, including but not limited to CPU, memory, disk, network, etc., and briefly describe their characteristics and application scenarios.
Assistant: Commonly used Linux server monitoring tools include: 1. top: It is used to monitor CPU and memory usage, and can display the CPU and memory usage of processes in real time, as well as the load of the system. It is a commonly used system monitoring tool. 2. sar: A system activity reporting tool that can record system resource usage, including CPU, memory, disk, network, etc., and can be used for long-term monitoring of system operation and trend analysis. 3. ps: Find and list the currently running processes in the Linux kernel, as well as their status and resource usage, which can be used to monitor the running status and resource usage of the process. 4. htop: A tool similar to top, but more powerful, it can display the CPU and memory usage of the process in real time, and supports mouse interaction, which can be used to quickly find and end the process. 5. iostat: used to monitor disk I/O performance, can display disk read and write rate and response time and other information, can be used to optimize disk performance and diagnose disk problems. 6. iftop: Used to monitor network traffic, it can display the bandwidth usage and traffic sources of network interfaces in real time, and can be used to diagnose network performance problems and limit traffic. 7. netstat: It is used to display network connection and network statistics information. It can list all network connections and their status, IP address and other information. It can be used to diagnose network connection problems and monitor network conditions. 8. tcpdump: It is used to capture network packets and analyze their content, supports multiple filter conditions and formats, and can be used to diagnose network problems and analyze network applications. The above tools have their own characteristics and can be used in combination to meet the monitoring needs in different scenarios. For example, you can use top and htop to monitor the CPU and memory usage of a process in real time, use sar and iostat to monitor server resource usage and disk I/O performance for a long time, use iftop and netstat to monitor network traffic and connection information, and use tcpdump to analyze the network data pack.
