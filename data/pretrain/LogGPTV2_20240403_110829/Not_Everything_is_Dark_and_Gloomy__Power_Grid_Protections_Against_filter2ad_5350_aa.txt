Abstract
Devices with high energy consumption such as air condi-
tioners, water heaters, and electric vehicles are increasingly
becoming Internet-connected. This new connectivity exposes
the control of new electric loads to attackers in what is known
as Manipulation of demand via IoT (MadIoT) attacks. In this
paper we investigate the impact of MadIoT attacks on power
transmission grids. Our analysis leverages a novel cascading
outage analysis tool that focuses on how the protection equip-
ment in the power grid as well as how protection algorithms
react to cascading events that can lead to a power blackout.
In particular, we apply our tool to a large North American
regional transmission interconnection system consisting of
more than 5,000 buses, and study how MadIoT attacks can
affect this power system. To help assess the effects of such
cyber attacks, we develop numerical experiments and deﬁne
new and stronger types of IoT demand attacks to study cas-
cading failures on transmission lines and their effects on the
system frequency. Our results show that MadIoT attacks can
cause a partition of the bulk power system, and can also result
in controlled load shedding, but the protections embedded in
the operation of the transmission grid can allow the system to
withstand a large variety of MadIoT attacks and can avoid a
system blackout.
1 Introduction
The vulnerability of Internet of Things (IoT) devices is a
well-known problem [11, 25, 46]. Previous work has demon-
strated that devices from cameras to door locks can be com-
promised directly or through their designated smart phone
applications [29, 43]. A large-scale compromise of these de-
vices can enable attackers to affect network infrastructures,
as exempliﬁed by the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)
attacks by the Mirai botnet—which consisted of more than
six hundred thousand IoT devices [13].
The collective effect of compromised IoT devices can go
beyond traditional computer network infrastructures. Recent
work proposed a novel form of attack called Manipulation
of demand via IoT (MadIoT) [47], and showed that if an at-
tacker compromised hundreds of thousands of high-energy
IoT devices (such as water heaters and air conditioners), the
attacker could cause various problems to the power grid, in-
cluding (i) frequency instabilities, (ii) line failures, and (iii)
increased operating costs. These attacks paint a dire picture
of the security of the power grid as they show that a 30% in-
crease in demand can trip all the generators in the US Western
interconnection causing a complete system blackout, and a
1% increase of demand in the Polish grid results in a cascade
of 263 transmission line failures, affecting 86% of the load in
the system.
In this paper we re-evaluate the potential impact of MadIoT
attacks by modeling in detail the protection equipment and
the operational responses to sudden load changes in the power
grid. Our analysis leverages a novel cascading outage analysis
tool that focuses on how the protection equipment already em-
bedded the power grid reacts during cascading events, where
multiple protection equipment is activated one after the other.
Our analysis shows that while MadIoT attacks can create
negative consequences on the power grid, the negative impact
on the grid will not be as dire as originally thought. In par-
ticular, while the most powerful MadIoT attacks (assuming
the attacker compromises more than 8 million air condition-
ers) might cause the power system to partition and operate
as separate islands, or can also cause some controlled load
shedding, our results show that creating a system blackout—
which would require a black start period of several days to
restart the grid— or even a blackout of a large percentage of
the bulk power grid will be very difﬁcult.
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the
background necessary to understand power systems and how
our tool compares to state-of-the-art practices for cascading
analysis. Section 3 presents the details of our simulations and
models. Section 4 illustrates why our cascade analysis tool
has advantages over competing alternatives in a simpliﬁed
model used in previous work. Our main results focusing on
the analysis of a large-scale North American interconnec-

tion undergoing MadIoT attacks are presented in Section 5.
Section 7 summarizes related work and Section 8 provides
conclusions, limitations, and future work.
2 Power Systems Background
Figure 1: Generation and Transmission form the Bulk of the
Power Grid. Transmission systems are redundant and have to
satisfy the N-1 operation criterion, while Distribution systems
are radial systems (non redundant) and affect a very small
percentage of the system.
The objective of engineers and researchers in the power
system industry is to deliver increasing amounts of electrical
energy in a safe, clean, and economical manner [31]. The
power grid has three major parts: (1) generation, (2) transmis-
sion, and (3) distribution. Electric power is generated wher-
ever it is convenient and economical, and then it is transmitted
at high voltages (100kV-500kV) in order to minimize energy
losses—electrical power is equal to voltage times electrical
current (P = V I), and given a constant power, high voltage
lines have less electrical current, and therefore there is less
energy lost as heat as the current moves through the transmis-
sion lines. Geographically, a distribution system is located in
a smaller region thereby energy losses are less of a concern
while safety (preventing accidents, ﬁres, electrocutions, etc.)
is more important, therefore they are operated at lower volt-
ages. Figure 1 illustrates these three main parts of the grid. A
distribution system is connected to a transmission system in a
substation and the conductor that completes the connections
is usually represented in electrical diagrams by nodes called
buses.
Operators have to keep the nominal frequency (e.g., 60Hz
in the Americas) and the transmission lines at their operat-
ing range (at a ﬁxed voltage like 500kV, and with currents
below a safety threshold) in order to ensure reliable opera-
tion of the grid. If there is a sudden increase in the demand
of electricity, the frequency of the power grid tends to slow
down, and automatic controls ramp up generation of electric-
ity to take the frequency back to 60Hz. If there is a sudden
decrease in the demand of electrical power, then the frequency
of the grid tends to increase, and automatic controls then de-
crease generation of electrical power to reduce the frequency
to the nominal level. Similarly sudden changes in electricity
consumption might overload transmission lines and activate
protection equipment (relays that prevent the ﬂow of electric-
ity through the line), and if this happens, the power is then
distributed to other transmission lines.
2.1 Transmission vs. Distribution Outages
Large generation plants and the transmission network are
usually referred to as the Bulk Power System, and this bulk
power system is responsible for the reliable delivery of elec-
tricity to large areas. The bulk power system is an intercon-
nected, redundant network that spans large regions—usually
one country, but in North America there are three bulk sys-
tems: the Eastern Interconnection, the Western Interconnec-
tion, and Texas. In contrast, distribution systems are geo-
graphically smaller and their networks are mostly radial (i.e.,
non-redundant).
The bulk power system is designed and operated to satisfy
the N-1 security criterion, which means that the system can
lose any one of its N components (such as generators or
transmission lines) and continue operating safely and serving
the power supply to the customers in the large area. This
operating criterion is mandatory and enforced by government
entities, and therefore bulk power system operators have the
incentives to make sure that their systems satisfy the N-1
criterion at any point in time, otherwise they get massive
sanctions. In contrast, since distribution systems are usually
non-redundant and serve customers in a regional area, they
do not have to meet the same operating criterion.
The reason distribution systems do not have to meet the N-1
criterion is the scale of a system failure. A disruption in the
bulk power grid will be the topic of national news headlines
because it causes a blackout in a large part of the country

(sometimes even the whole country), while a disruption in the
distribution system will usually only cause a localized outage
(e.g., a neighborhood will be without electricity). Electric
power in the distribution grid can also be more easily restored,
while a system blackout of the bulk power system will require
days of coordination in what is called black start period.
While distribution systems are not required to follow the
N-1 criterion, there are separate criteria applied to them. For
example, the hours of successful power supply to consumers
as percentage of the total hours in a year is required to meet
certain standard e.g. 99.999%. Other details of the distribution
system will not be discussed as they go beyond the scope of
this paper.
As we will show later in the paper, one of the protections
embedded in the power system to prevent a bulk power outage
is called Under Frequency Load Shedding (UFLS), which
is a mechanism where predetermined blocks of customers in
the distribution system are automatically dropped from the
system. This is a carefully selected procedure where electric-
ity is not cut to safety-critical loads like Hospitals. We will
show that some of the most severe MadIoT attacks will acti-
vate this protection and therefore can cause some controlled
outages, but at the same time, these small outages are done
in order to prevent that the bulk system goes into a cascading
failure resulting in a system blackout.
2.2 Failure Analysis in the Bulk Power Grid
The power grid analysis tool we use in this paper was devel-
oped to address the limitations for modeling and analyzing
cascading failures identiﬁed by the task force from the IEEE
Power Engineering Society [14,15]. As stated in these reports,
most of the research in cascading failure analysis focuses on
independent phenomenons, but these interactions are often
ignored. In our recent work on cascading failures [33, 53–56]
we have been developing a tool that captures the time interde-
pendencies of all relevant protection equipment and stability
studies in the power grid when multiple simultaneous (or
quasi-simultaneous) contingencies occur. In this paper we
adapt our tool to model MadIoT attacks. Before we discuss
our approach in more detail, we now present related work in
the analysis of failures in the power grid and discuss how our
system compares to these approaches.
Cascading failure analysis has attracted a lot of attention
from the research community [14,44,52]. There are two main
approaches for studying cascading failures: stochastic models,
and ﬁne-grained simulations.
Stochastic models are used to evaluate the likelihood of
a cascading event by giving us the probability of having in-
correct settings for protection equipment in a given power
system [26, 45]. To build these estimates, stochastic models
perform a forensic analysis of previous cascading failures by
looking at the properties of power systems just before they
experienced a system blackout. Although these models pro-
vide a probabilistic insight of cascading events, they cannot
be used to model the operation of a power system undergoing
a cascade, which is particularly important when we want to
understand how the system reacts to incidents in general (and
cyber-attacks in particular). To understand the operation of
the power system undergoing cascading failures we need to
turn to detailed simulation models.
2.2.1 Power System Simulations
There are two main behaviors that we need to study when a
system undergoes a failure:
1. Transient Analysis ﬁnds the behavior of the frequency
in the power grid in the immediate aftermath of the inci-
dent. If the frequency deviates too far from 60Hz, some
protection equipment will be activated. There are two
options for transient analysis.
(a) No System Dynamics: This is a very fast compu-
tational method where the behavior of all genera-
tors is simpliﬁed to only one generation machine.
This allows us to evaluate how the frequency of
the system behaves with big changes in electricity
consumption. Several cascading studies use this
method [35,41]. This simpliﬁcation cannot capture
the frequency at every bus in the system (therefore
it cannot model if a power system is partitioned
into islands), nor model how each generator will
react differently to cascading incidents (therefore
it cannot model how the protection mechanism in
each generator will activate).
(b) System Dynamics: In this type of transient anal-
ysis we model all generators in the power system
and all the frequencies in all the buses of the system.
This is in line with one of the main objectives of a
transient stability study—to determine whether the
resulting angular separation between the machines
in the system remains within certain bounds so
that the system maintains synchronism [36]. Cas-
cading analysis models with system dynamics are
considered in [28, 34, 40].
2. Steady-State Analysis ﬁnds the voltages and currents
of the system after all frequency equipment has tripped
and can help us understand if the system ends up in a
conﬁguration where voltage protection or overcurrent
protection equipment will activate. To compute these
values, a power ﬂow program uses Kirchhoff’s physical
laws to obtain the voltage magnitudes and phase angles
at each bus of a power system. As a by-product of this
calculation we can also compute real and reactive power
ﬂows in equipment such as transmission lines and trans-
formers, as well as equipment losses [31]. There are two
ways to perform steady state analysis:

28th USENIX Security Symposium    1117
(a) DC Power Flow: Direct Current (DC) Power Flow
is a very fast way to compute voltages and phase
angles. There are several cascading analysis studies
that use DC Power Flow models [22, 27, 57]. DC
power ﬂow models however are approximations to
AC models, and they do not show the variations on
voltages that might trigger protection equipment,
therefore DC methods are only valid when voltages
are close to their nominal values, which rules out
their use for modeling large-scale events such as
MadIoT attacks.
(b) AC Power Flow: Alternating Current (AC) Power
Flow is a more accurate (but computationally more
expensive) way to analyze the steady state behav-
ior of the power system. The only way to model
voltage protection systems is with the use of AC
power ﬂow. Cascading analysis with AC power
ﬂow methods include [35, 41].
4. Over/Under Voltage Protection: if the voltage of a bus
is too low or too high, a voltage relay will be triggered
after time T . This activation time depends on an equa-
tion modeling conﬁguration thresholds and over/under
voltage relay pick-up values [2].
2.2.3
Industry Practices
For day-to-day operations related to power grid failures,
power operators focus on satisfying the N-1 criterion as this
is the most important failure condition that is regulated and
enforced by most electric regulatory agencies. Large-scale
events such as a massive natural disaster, a terrorist attack,
or a cyber-attack have not been a major priority for industry
practices because the likelihood of these events is very small,
and investment in preparing for these events has higher costs
than responding to them when they happen [49].
2.2.2 Power System Protections
In the previous subsection we have argued that the best prac-
tices for an accurate portrayal of power system behavior under
large-scale events (i.e., events where voltages go beyond nom-
inal values, and where individual generators might go beyond
safety limits) is to use (1) System Dynamics for transient
analysis, and (2) AC Power ﬂow for steady-state analysis.
In this section we describe how the results of our transient
and steady-state simulations are used to evaluate how protec-
tion equipment in the power grid will react to changes in the
operation of the system.
In particular, we model four protection mechanisms that
are relevant for cascading analysis studies:
1. Protection of Generators: when the frequency of the
system is too low or too high, the generator will be auto-
matically disconnected from the power grid to prevent
permanent damages to the generator.
2. Under Frequency Load Shedding (UFLS): if the fre-
quency of the power grid is too low, controlled load
shedding will be activated. As discussed before, this dis-
connection of portions of the distribution system is done
in a controlled manner, while avoiding outages in safety-
critical loads like hospitals. UFLS is activated in an effort
