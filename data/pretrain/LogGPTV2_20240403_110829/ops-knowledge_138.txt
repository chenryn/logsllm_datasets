User: Which is better to use in a python automation script for following simple operations
To create a zip file and copy it or rename it to a new location.
Using python inbuilt functions or terminal commands through os.system modules is better?
Assistant: I would say python ones since it'll make the script portable. But sometimes, performance and availability are of concerns.
