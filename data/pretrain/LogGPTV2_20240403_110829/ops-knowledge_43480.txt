User: There is an application that needs to download a large amount of data from a remote server, but there will be a network disconnection during the download process. Please provide a network recovery scheme so that the app can automatically reconnect and resume downloading.
Assistant: A feasible network recovery solution is as follows: 1. Establish a download manager to manage the download process, including download progress, download status and other information. 2. When the network is interrupted, the download manager starts to retry the connection until the connection is successful. 3. After the connection is successful, the download manager checks the downloaded part, finds the breakpoint, and resumes the download from the place where it was interrupted last time. 4. If the network interruption exceeds the preset times and time limit, the download manager stops the download and sets the download status as failed. 5. The download manager records logs during the download process, so that you can troubleshoot when there is a problem. Through this solution, the download manager can automatically reconnect and continue downloading, ensuring the continuity of user experience. At the same time, by recording logs, it is convenient to troubleshoot problems and improve the stability and reliability of applications.
