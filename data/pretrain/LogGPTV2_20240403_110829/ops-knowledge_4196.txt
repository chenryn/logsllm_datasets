When attempting to use the Canopy Package Manager to "subscribe" to Biopython, you are prompted to pay for it. However, you can still use Biopython without incurring any costs. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Install Biopython independently of Canopy on your machine. For example, you might install it in a directory such as `/path/to/biopython`.

2. In Canopy, add the following lines of code to your script:
   ```python
   import sys
   sys.path.append('/path/to/biopython')
   ```

By doing this, you will be able to use Biopython within Canopy without needing to pay for the subscription.
