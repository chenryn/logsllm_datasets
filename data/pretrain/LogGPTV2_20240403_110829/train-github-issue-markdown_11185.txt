## Expected Behavior
When I use `noWrap` on Typography, it should not cut my "g" off, just like
without `noWrap`

## Current Behavior

## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
Use https://material-ui-1dab0.firebaseapp.com/demos/drawers/#responsive-drawer
and add a `g`  
in the title
## Context
This is happening because adding `noWrap` adds `overflow: hidden`, is this
needed? Can we switch to ` overflow-x: hidden` or remove it completely?
Another fix would be to make the component with `overflow: hidden` fit higher
chars.
Thoughts?
