User: Is there a standard way to make sure a python script will be interpreted by python2 and not python3? On my distro, I can use #!/usr/bin/env python2 as the shebang, but it seems not all distros ship "python2". I could explicitly call a specific version (eg. 2.6) of python, but that would rule out people who don't have that version.
It seems to me that this is going to be increasingly a problem when distros will start putting python3 as the default python interpreter.
Assistant: As I understand different distros will be in different locations in your drive. Here are some suggestions that come to mind - 

You could use UNIX alias to create shortcuts pointing to the different distros. Eg: alias py2="/usr/bin/python2.X". So when you run your script you could use py2 xx.py
Or other way could be to modify your PYTHON_PATH environment variable.
Or if I am not wrong there is a provision in sys module to get the current python version number. You could get that & deal appropriately.

This should do it...
