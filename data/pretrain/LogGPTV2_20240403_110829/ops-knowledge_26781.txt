User: I have a domain xyz.com and right now it is pointing to my app in appspot. I want to send email alerts to users for various events. However, appengine restricts email sender to admin email address which was used to create the google app engine account.
Can I send emails on behalf of user@xyz.com using app engine? If not, is there a simple workaround to do this?
Assistant: When sending email, you can designate the sender as either the currently logged in user or any registered administrator. It does not have to be the administrator who created the app.
Also note that you can add any email address as an administrator on your app (from the permissions tab in the admin console). It does not need to be a Gmail or Google Apps account; any email account that you can access to click on the confirmation link will work.
