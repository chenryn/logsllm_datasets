User: I am having trouble importing Pyperclip in IDLE.
I am running windows 7 (64-bit).
I have Python 3.5.2 Installed on: C:\Python\Python35.
I opened command prompt and initiated the install by typing pip install pyperclip after changing directory to C:\Python\Python35\Scripts. 
It successfully installed Pyperclip-1.5.27. 
I then went to IDLE and typed in import pyperclip but the following error is showing up: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "", line 1, in 
    import pyperclip
ImportError: No module named 'pyperclip'
I tried to fix this by adding "C:\Python\Python35" to the end of the "Path" variable, in the systems environmental variables.
Assistant: It unpacked pyperclip in the wrong directory. I copied the entire pyperclip folder and put it in C:/python/python35, now it works as it should. Seems like a noob mistake on my part, but it took me a long time to figure this out.  I hope this helps someone in the future.
