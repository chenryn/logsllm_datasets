ABSTRACT
The Controller Area Network (CAN) is a bus standard commonly
used in the automotive industry for connecting Electronic Control
Units (ECUs) within a vehicle. The broadcast nature of this protocol,
along with the lack of authentication or strong integrity guarantees
for frames, allows for arbitrary data injection/modification and
impersonation of the ECUs. While mitigation strategies have been
proposed to counter these attacks, high implementation costs or
violation of backward compatibility hinder their deployment. In
this work, we first examine the shortcomings of state-of-the-art
CAN intrusion detection and identification systems that rely on
multiple frames to detect misbehavior and attribute it to a particular
ECU, and show that they are vulnerable to a Hill-Climbing-style
attack. Then we propose SIMPLE, a real-time intrusion detection
and identification system that exploits physical layer features of
ECUs, which would not only allow an attack to be detected using
a single frame but also be effectively nullified. SIMPLE has low
computational and data acquisition costs, and its efficacy is demon-
strated by both in-lab experiments with automotive-grade CAN
transceivers as well as in-vehicle experiments, where average equal
error rates of close to 0% and 0.8985% are achieved, respectively.

1 INTRODUCTION
The Controller Area Network (CAN) bus is the de facto indus-
try standard for in-vehicle networks used in modern vehicles for
connecting Electronic Control Units (ECUs). ECUs are embedded
systems with specific automotive-related duty, such as engine con-
trol, braking, etc. ECUs are involved with safety-critical tasks, such
as braking and engine control, which require information that is
communicated via the CAN bus, consequently the safety of the pas-
sengers is directly dependent upon the security of the bus [16, 52].
It has been demonstrated should an attacker gain access to the CAN
bus, forged messages can be sent that affect the safe operation of
the vehicle (e.g., causing the vehicle to accelerate [12], stopping
the engine, disabling the brakes, selectively braking [30], or dis-
abling the transmission [19]). The connection can be through direct
connection [30] or via a remotely compromised ECU [5].
Based on existing studies, the confidentiality of CAN messages
is not strictly necessary to provide safe operation, whereas au-
thentication and integrity are essential. A CAN frame can only
accommodate eight bytes of both data and cryptographic informa-
tion (Sec. 2.1), hence, providing authentication and integrity via
message authentication codes (MACs) or digital signatures is not a
straightforward proposition. In [49] an out-of-band channel (CAN+
[55]) is leveraged to transmit authentication information; in [39]
a delayed authentication scheme is proposed that uses multiple
frames to generate a compound MAC; and variable-length MACs
are used in [43] to offer protection commensurate with a message’s
criticality. In short, existing techniques are either insecure or com-
putationally intensive which makes them incapable of a reliable
authentication on a frame-by-frame basis.
As strong authentication guarantees cannot be provided for
legacy CAN, intrusion/anomaly detection systems (I/ADS) have
been proposed that would at least allow for appropriate counter-
measures to be taken in the event of an attack (e.g., ignoring suspect
messages or putting the car into a safe state) [20, 21, 31, 37, 38, 44].
Of particular relevance to the current work is the subset of IDS that
leverage, broadly speaking, device fingerprinting techniques based
on differentiating devices according to either timing [8, 35] or the
physical-layer characteristics of frames, such as voltage [9, 10, 36].
However, most approaches rely on multiple frames sent by an ECU
to evaluate and update the fingerprints.
In this paper, we first demonstrate that state-of-the-art device
fingerprinting-based intrusion detection and identification systems
(e.g., [36], [8], and [9] etc.) are fundamentally vulnerable to Hill-
climbing-style attacks, because they either entirely or partially de-
pend on multiple frames to identify the sender of a frame. Due
to the multi-frame dependence, a Hill-climbing-style attacker is
able to exploit a compromised ECU to impersonate another ECU
without being detected or identified. The attack is achieved by care-
fully injecting an increasing amount of malicious messages among
legitimate messages, so as to gradually shift the profile of the target
ECU toward the attacker’s. Since during consecutive time periods
the profile only shifts slightly, the attack remains undetected or
unidentified. Ultimately, the attacker ECU will be able to inject a
majority, or replace all, of the frames sent by the target ECU with
its own. Our attack can be regarded as a type of online data poi-
soning attack against machine learning systems [28] (especially,
for classification) which acquire/update training data in an online
manner.
Motived by this attack, we propose SIMPLE, a SIngle-fraMe
based Physical-LayEr identification solution to detect intrusion and
identify the source of each single CAN frame that is transmitted on a
bus by a specific ECU regardless of its message ID. We extract unique
voltage-based features (fingerprints) in the time-domain from each
individual CAN frame transmitted and contribute to an ECU. Unlike
existing multi-frame IDS systems, SIMPLE performs secure updates
of training data by modelling and compensating for the changes in
environment and operating conditions (e.g., temperature and supply
voltage). Since fingerprinting in SIMPLE is done on a per-frame
basis and is very computationally lightweight, the detection can
finish even before a frame’s transmission ends, thus enabling real-
time prevention of intrusion attacks by invalidating the spurious
frame before it takes effect on the vehicle. SIMPLE is a single-frame
based intrusion detection and identification system that (to the best
of our knowledge) for the first time achieves attack prevention with
secure updates.
Our main contributions are summarized as follows:
• We demonstrate that a Hill-climbing-style attack can defeat
multi-frame based intrusion detection and/or identification
systems, in particular for vehicular CANs. We validate the
effectiveness of our attack against two existing IDSs: physical
layer-based Viden [9] and clock-based IDS CIDS [10].
• We propose SIMPLE, a single-frame based physical-layer
identification solution. SIMPLE is a dual intrusion detection
and identification system, which is computationally light-
weight and can make detection and identification decisions
before a frame ends.
• SIMPLE performs secure updates of the fingerprints to com-
pensate for environmental changes, such as temperature and
supply voltage. SIMPLE can also prevent intrusion attacks
by invalidating spurious frames before they take effect.
• We evaluate SIMPLE using both an in-lab testbed with ten
automotive-grade ECUs, and in-vehicle experiments. For the
in-lab experiments we show that SIMPLE can distinguish
perfectly between the frames transmitted from compromised
ECU and benign frames, even when the fingerprint changes
due to environmental effects. For the in-vehicle experiments
we show that SIMPLE achieves a low equal error rate (EER)
around 0.8985%.

Section 2 provides a brief background on the preliminary of the
CAN protocol, the applications of PLI, and a survey of existing
works. Sec. 3 presents our attack model. Sec. 4 demonstrates the Hill-
climbing-style attack against two state-of-the-art fingerprinting
schemes. Sec. 5 describes SIMPLE, which is then analyzed and
evaluated in Sec. 6 and Sec. 7, respectively. Finally, we draw our
conclusion in Sec. 8.
2 BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK
2.1 CAN protocol
CAN is a protocol created in 1986 by Robert Bosch GmbH [4], for
communication among ECUs within in-vehicle networks. It is a two-
wire, half-duplex bus generating CAN High (CANH) and CAN Low
(CANL) signals as output which are shown in Fig. 1b. The details
of the CAN protocol is given in [15]. All the ECUs are connected to
the same bus, thus they can receive all the frames broadcasted on
the bus.
There are a few features of the CAN protocol that are related to
this work. First, each ECU can be assigned one or multiple message
identifiers (IDs) that it can send out, which usually represents the
data type. Two or more ECUs that want to transmit at the same
time have to participate in so-called priority-based arbitration in
order to occupy the CAN bus. The lower the numerical value of
the ID is, the higher the priority the message has. Second, any ECU
that observes an error in a frame will transmit an Error Frame
that will cause other ECUs to discard the previous/current frame
(an ACK slot at the end of each CAN frame allows the ECU that
transmitted the frame to determine if a single ECU successfully
received the frame) [4]. In addition, message reception is not based
on destination address but on message ID (for example, an engine
ECU is programmed to receive only certain subset of “interesting”
message IDs related to engine status/control).
From the security aspect, weak integrity check is performed
by calculating the cyclic redundancy checks (CRC) in each frame.
Considering that an ECU can forge the ID, the protocol lacks strong
authenticity, which can be fulfilled by using physical layer identifi-
cation.
2.2 Physical Layer Identification (PLI)
To enhance authenticity, most of the solutions offered so far impose
modifications to the protocol. Cryptographic solutions such as
message authentication codes (MACs) [43] are not ideal due to
limited length of CAN frames and the computational constraints
of ECUs. The PLI technique is potentially free of these drawbacks,
while it avoids changing the CAN protocol.
PLI takes into account the hardware and manufacturing incon-
sistencies that cause minute and unique variations in the signalling
behaviour of devices, and translates them into features that can
provide reliable identification [50]. A typical PLI system includes
three major steps, namely, data acquisition, feature extraction and
decision [18]. The data acquisition converts an analogue voltage
to a digital signal using an analogue to digital converter (ADC) for
further processing; the feature extraction module performs the task
of acquiring fingerprints for the devices by leveraging the statistical
or physical layer characteristics of the signals collected in the pre-
vious step and using them to find features; and lastly, the decision
module compares the extracted fingerprints from the training data
with the ones from the test data using a specific distance metric and
defines a threshold for final identification decision making based
on how close the features are. Fig. 1a illustrates an overview of a
PLI system. Interested readers are encouraged to read about PLI
and its applications in [14, 17].
Our proposed scheme SIMPLE also leverages PLI. Among the
diverse techniques that are available, we use the Fisher Discrim-
inant Analysis (FDA) transform, which is a dimension reduction
technique, followed by a distance calculator named Mahalanobis
distance [2], so as to extract and process relevant features from the
analog signals and use them as the discriminators in our system.
2.3 Related work
Existing PLI systems can be categorized into timing-based methods
and voltage-based methods.
Timing-based. CAN messages are typically sent in a periodic
manner. The analysis on the interval/frequency of the messages
might be able to show the first evidence of intrusion. Müter et
al. [37] use entropy to analyze the randomness of intervals. Moore et
al. [35] proposed a data-driven inter-signal arrival times model to de-
tect injection attacks. Abnormality detection sensors [38] evaluate
the payload length, frequency or correlation, etc. Taylor et al. [44]
proposed to detect anomalies of the sequence data transmitted from
an ECU by applying neural networks. A similar work [31] auto-
matically classifies the fields in CAN messages and measures valid
ranges based on previous data, which is computationally expensive.
Ying et al. proposed [53] TACAN based on shared crytographic keys
and inter-arrival times, which introduced computational overhead.
Cho and Shin [8] proposed clock skew based fingerprints for their
PLI-based IDS, CIDS. However, the timing-based approaches can be
easily defeated by an adversary imitating the target ECU’s timing
behavior [10, 40]. Avatefipour et al. [1] train a neural network to
capture the features in both frequency and time domain, which is
impractical for a CAN bus because of an ECU’s weak computational
ability.
Voltage-based. The voltage output nature differs among the
transmitters of ECUs, enabling voltage-based approaches to detect
the intrusion and identify its source. Murvay et al. [36] took the
first step towards voltage identification, which is later extended
by several contributions such as Viden [9], VoltageIDS [10], and
Scission [29]. These methods construct and update voltage profiles
for the ECUs and use them for identification of malicious messages.
However, the effect of the variations of voltage power source and
ambient temperature on these features is non-negligible and has
not been taken into consideration. That is, the life-span of the valid
features would be limited to a short interval as the source voltage
would be easily affected by any change in ambient temperature.
This is the reason the features need to be updated every time the

vehicle is restarted, which motivates applying adaptive profile up-
dates [9]. In fact, because the features smoothly evolve through
time, Viden has to keep track of these changes by updating their
profiles through time, which makes Viden vulnerable due to the
lack of secure training data that updates with time.
Most existing works (e.g., [9], [8], etc.) in both timing and voltage-
based categories rely on multiple messages to make detection and
identification decisions. We found that, such reliance on multiple
messages makes them vulnerable to a variance of Hill-climbing-
style attack [42], in which the adversary is able to inject carefully
chosen fraction of malicious messages without being either de-
tected or identified. Furthermore, the adversary is able to iteratively
increase the injection rate so that the detection and identification
decision threshold can be shifted. We will demonstrate such vulner-
