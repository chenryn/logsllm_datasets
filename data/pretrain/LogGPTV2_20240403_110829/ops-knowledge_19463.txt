User: Whenever I try running virtualenv, it returns command not found.
Per recommendations in other posts, I have tried installing virtualenv with both $ pip install virtualenv and $ sudo pip install virtualenv. I have uninstalled and tried again multiple times.
I think the issue is that I am using OSX, and pip is installing virtualenv in /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/site-packages. As I understand, it should be installed in /usr/local/bin/.
How can I install virtualenv there?
Assistant: Try adding /usr/local/share/python in /etc/launchd.conf and ~/.bashrc. This might resolve the issue you are facing.
