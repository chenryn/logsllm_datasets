User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题glusterfs: failed to get the 'volume file' from server I have a GlusterFS volume hosted on a remote fileserver. I can mount the volume from my webservers in the same DC as well as other servers in other DCs however when I try to mount the volume on my local dev server the mount fails with the following log entry:

I've verified that the firewall is not blocking the packets, all machines are running the same version of GlusterFS from the same repo and I can telnet to the gluster ports from the local server but I'm still unable to mount the volume on any machines within my local network. 

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Assistant: You must provide the VOLUME NAME in the mount command, not the PATH.
