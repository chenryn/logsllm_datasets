User: If there is a thread that answers this question I'm sorry for being a fool (reading through the titles and the threads that look like they might have been [about] the same as mine, none of them were close enough for me to be able to figure it out for myself.
I'm looking to have a script (I suppose bash or python would be preferable, since I'm working on learning Python; but at the moment really I'd settle for almost anything).
From a directory (so I'm already "cd"'d to the directory; so it can adapt to whichever directory) I'd like to be able to:
RUN_SCRIPT "File 1", "File 2", "File 3", "File 4", "File 5"..."File (n-1)", "File (n)"
or
RUN_SCRIPT "File *"
and have it (in some form) accomplish the same thing I'm doing when (at the moment) from the directory I'm using:
    ftp -inv << FTP
    open ftp.HOST.com
    user USER_NAME PASSWORD
    mput "FILE NAME"
    bye
    FTP
And having to do that in multiple shell windows (one for each file).
Being able to have it run X instances of ftp at a time would be nice, but isn't at all necessary (just being able to tell it to do all of them at once is fine).
Thanks in advance!  This site is epic (can't wait for the time when I can be answering questions instead of just asking them).
Side Question: If what I want to be able to do isn't possible for some reason I can't possibly comprehend; is there a way to smash the command list I have into one line?
Assistant: I would pick a different FTP client. The libcurl library (and its "curl" command line program) has a FTP upload method.
