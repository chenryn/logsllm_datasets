**Subject: Issue with PIL Installation on Google App Engine**

Hi Matthew,

I understand that you are using OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard and have successfully installed the Python Imaging Library (PIL). You can import the `Image` module without any issues in the terminal. However, when you try to use Google App Engine, you encounter an error indicating that PIL is not installed.

To resolve this issue, here are a few steps you can follow:

1. **Ensure Correct Environment**: Verify that the Python environment used by Google App Engine is the same one where PIL is installed. Sometimes, different environments may be used, leading to such discrepancies.

2. **Use Virtual Environments**: Consider using a virtual environment (e.g., `virtualenv`) to manage your dependencies. This ensures that all required packages, including PIL, are available in the environment used by Google App Engine.

3. **Check for Compatibility**: Ensure that the version of PIL you are using is compatible with the version of Python and the libraries used by Google App Engine. Some versions of PIL may not work correctly with certain configurations.

4. **Include Dependencies in app.yaml**: If you are using a `requirements.txt` file, make sure it includes PIL. Additionally, update your `app.yaml` file to include the necessary dependencies:
   ```yaml
   runtime: python27
   api_version: 1
   threadsafe: true

   handlers:
     - url: /.*
       script: main.app

   libraries:
     - name: PIL
       version: latest
   ```

5. **Verify Installation in App Engine**: After making these changes, deploy your application to Google App Engine and check if the issue persists. You can also add some logging to confirm that PIL is being imported correctly within the App Engine environment.

If you continue to experience issues, please provide more details about the specific error message and any relevant configuration files. This will help in diagnosing the problem further.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

However, the general idea of ensuring the correct Python environment and dependencies is still relevant.
