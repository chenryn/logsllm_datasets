User: I am working on a django app on my macbook with Yosemite.
My app was in a virtual environment.
I restarted my terminal and when I cd'd to my app it was no longer in the virtual environment and now doesn't run. And all my virtual environment commands give me -bash: command not found.
I fully recognize this is a very noobie question but I really want to work on my app and I have tried everything I could find on google and stackoverflow.
Please help.
Preferably with the commands I need to type from my command line - thank you!
Assistant: I assume you're using virtualenv.  If so, do you know where it put the bin directory?  If so, run source bin/activate.  After that, when you try runserver, it should use the correct Python instance.
More complete:
source /path/to/bin/activate
But I typically run source bin/activate from the directory that contains the related bin.
