# Impostor: Polluting Tor Metadata

## Authors
- Mike Larsen

## Summary
This document discusses the detection and potential spoofing of Tor traffic, including specific Snort rules for identifying Tor connections. The aim is to provide insights into how Tor can be detected and how such detection can be circumvented.

## Example Snort Rule
```snort
alert tcp $HOME_NET any -> $EXTERNAL_NET 9030:9031 (msg:"POLICY-OTHER TOR traffic anonymizer server request"; flow:established,to_server; content:"GET /tor/server"; fast_pattern:only; classtype:policy-violation; sid:9324; rev:5;)
```

## About Us
We are a team dedicated to improving the security and anonymity of the Tor network by exploring and sharing methods to detect and potentially spoof Tor traffic.

## The Issue
Tor aims to prevent attackers from identifying the destination websites you connect to. However, by default, it does not hide the fact that you are using Tor. To mitigate this, you can configure Tor to use a bridge relay, which routes your traffic through a less obvious entry point. The more diverse the Tor user base in your area, the safer it becomes for individual users. Encouraging others to use Tor can enhance overall security.

## Impact
- **Harvard Bomb Threat Case (2013)**
  - On December 16, 2013, Harvard officials received a bomb threat via an email sent from Guerrilla Mail, a service that creates temporary and anonymous email addresses.
  - The sender accessed Guerrilla Mail using Tor, and it was determined that the individual used Harvard's wireless network to access Tor.

## Is Tor Safe?
While Tor provides a high level of anonymity, it is not foolproof. There are known vulnerabilities and implementation issues that can be exploited. For example:
- **Onion Browser**: A security audit revealed several vulnerabilities.
- **CVE-2013-1690**: An exploit in Firefox that could be used to de-anonymize Tor users.
- **PORTAL**: A tool that blocks egress except via Tor, managed out of band.
- **obfsproxy and FTE**: These tools help obfuscate Tor traffic, but their effectiveness depends on proper configuration.

## Tor Overview
- **Relays**: Publish information to directory authorities.
- **Directory Authorities**: Create a consensus of relays.
- **Clients**: Bootstrap by downloading the consensus and choose their own network path.

## Detection Models
- **Connections to the Tor Network**: Identify traffic to Tor entry points.
- **Connections from the Tor Network**: Identify traffic from Tor exit nodes.
- **Leaking Tor Clients**: Detect clients that inadvertently reveal their identity.

### Snort VRT Rules
```snort
alert tcp $HOME_NET any -> $EXTERNAL_NET 9030:9031 (msg:"POLICY-OTHER TOR traffic anonymizer server request"; flow:established,to_server; content:"GET /tor/server"; fast_pattern:only; classtype:policy-violation; sid:9324; rev:5;)
alert tcp $HOME_NET any -> $EXTERNAL_NET 9001:9030 (msg:"POLICY-OTHER TOR proxy connection initiation"; flow:to_server,established; content:"TOR"; content:"client "; classtype:policy-violation; sid:13696; rev:3;)
```

### Snort ETOpen Rules
```snort
alert udp $HOME_NET any -> any 53 (msg:"ET POLICY DNS Query for TOR Hidden Domain .onion Accessible Via TOR"; content:"|01 00 00 01 00 00 00 00 00 00|"; depth:10; offset:2; content:"|05|onion|00|"; fast_pattern; distance:0; reference:url,en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.onion; classtype:policy-violation; sid:2014939; rev:1;)
alert udp $HOME_NET any -> any 53 (msg:"ET POLICY TOR .exit Pseudo TLD DNS Query"; content:"|01 00 00 01 00 00 00 00 00 00|"; depth:10; offset:2; content:"|04|exit|00|"; fast_pattern; distance:0; reference:url,en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.onion; classtype:policy-violation; sid:2014941; rev:3;)
alert tcp [101.109.17.96,101.55.12.75,103.10.197.50,103.4.19.125,106.186.21.31,106.187.45.156,106.187.90.158,107.161.153.170,107.161.158.146,107.161.81.187] any -> $HOME_NET any (msg:"ET TOR Known Tor Exit Node TCP Traffic group 1"; flags:S; reference:url,doc.emergingthreats.net/bin/view/Main/TorRules; threshold: type limit, track by_src, seconds 60, count 1; classtype:misc-attack; flowbits:set,ET.TorIP; sid:2520000; rev:1815;)
alert udp [101.109.17.96,101.55.12.75,103.10.197.50,103.4.19.125,106.186.21.31,106.187.45.156,106.187.90.158,107.161.153.170,107.161.158.146,107.161.81.187] any -> $HOME_NET any (msg:"ET TOR Known Tor Exit Node UDP Traffic group 1"; reference:url,doc.emergingthreats.net/bin/view/Main/TorRules; threshold: type limit, track by_src, seconds 60, count 1; classtype:misc-attack; flowbits:set,ET.TorIP; sid:2520001; rev:1815;)
```

### JavaScript Pros and Cons
- **Pros**:
  - Low impact
  - Easy to opt out
  - Easy to publish (e.g., XSS, ad networks)
- **Cons**:
  - XHR limitations (certain headers cannot be set)
  - Browser prohibited ports (prevents cross-protocol scripting)
  - Limited ability to generate UDP traffic

### Bro Script
```bro
event ssl_established(c: connection) {
    if (c$ssl?$subject && /^CN=[^=,]*$/ == c$ssl$subject && c$ssl?$issuer && /^CN=[^=,]*$/ == c$ssl$issuer) {
        SumStats::observe("ssl.tor-looking-cert", [$host=c$id$orig_h], [$str=c$ssl$subject]);
    }
}
```

## Other Detection Techniques
- **Time Synchronization**: Analyze time synchronization patterns.
- **TBB User-Agent**: Identify unique user-agent strings.
- **512 Bytes Cells**: Look for characteristic cell sizes.

## Endgame
- **Is it possible to write rules that cannot be spoofed by a browser?**

## Testing Your Tools
- Verify that [Impostor.io](https://impostor.io) does not work.
- Ensure detection works (e.g., boot Tails).
- Capture and analyze `.pcap` files.
- Look for clues in alert descriptions and details.
- Ask for feedback.

## How You Can Help
- Visit [Impostor.io](https://impostor.io).
- Test against your security tools.
- Support the Tor Project: [Donate](https://www.torproject.org/donate/donate).

## Supporting Anonymity

## Summary
- Tor traffic is easy to detect.
- Detection can be easily fooled.
- You can help make Tor safer.
