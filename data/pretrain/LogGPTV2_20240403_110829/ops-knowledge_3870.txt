Question: A mobile application developer needs to securely handle sensitive data such as passwords and encryption keys in memory. Which of the following approaches would be the most secure for managing this sensitive data in a Swift or Objective-C application?
"A": "Use NSString and String for storing sensitive data and overwrite them with new values when done.",
"B": "Employ primitive data structures like char [] and int [], and ensure they are overwritten with zeroes after use.",
"C": "Implement custom classes that subclass Swift's String to provide functionality for securely erasing data from memory.",
"D": "Store sensitive data in mutable collections like Array or Set, and use their built-in methods to clear the data."
Answer: B
