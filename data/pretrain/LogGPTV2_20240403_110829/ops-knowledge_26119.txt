Question: "A tester intercepts an HTTP response from a web application during a security audit. The response contains the following headers:


Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true


What is the likely outcome in a browser that adheres to the CORS specification when these headers are present in the response?"
 "A": "The browser will ignore the Access-Control-Allow-Credentials header because the wildcard in Access-Control-Allow-Origin is incompatible with credentials being true."
 "B": "The browser will allow the response to be read by the requesting script even with credentials passed, due to the wildcard in Access-Control-Allow-Origin."
 "C": "The browser will block the response because the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header contains a wildcard, which is considered a security risk."
 "D": "The response will be cached indefinitely in the browser because the Access-Control-Allow-Credentials header implies permission for long-term storage."
Answer: A
