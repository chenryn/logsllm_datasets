User: Please explain how to use DNS (Domain Name System, Domain Name System) to resolve the domain name of a website, and describe the difference between DNS record types.
Assistant: DNS is a system for resolving domain names into IP addresses. To resolve the domain name of a website, the DNS server first looks it up in its cache, and if it finds the corresponding IP address, it returns it directly to the user. If not found, a request is sent to the root domain name server. The root domain name server returns the IP address of the authoritative DNS server pointing to the first-level domain name server to the DNS server. The DNS server will repeat this step until it finds an authoritative DNS server and obtains the website's IP address from it. There are several differences between DNS record types: 1. A record: resolves a domain name to an IPv4 address 2. AAAA record: resolves a domain name to an IPv6 address 3. CNAME record: maps one domain name to another, which is a A way of associating one domain name with another related domain name 4. MX record: specifies the mail server that handles email traffic for the domain 5. TXT record: you can add arbitrary text to the DNS record 6. NS record: specifies the DNS server that resolves a specific domain name 7. SOA record: Specifies the initial authoritative record of the domain name, including host name and email information.
