User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题net::ERR_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH on Nginx and SSL I have a problem with one of my servers witch I cannot resolve. I keep getting net::ERR_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH in Chrome on images or css/js scripts. Nginx is not proxy, it's just serving files himself. The error doesn't appear every time and after i refresh the page it disappears. It appears on computers with a fast internet connection with the server (tested multiple networks). It also appears in firefox but has a different error message.
Iv'e tried to disable gzip on server, disabled files metdata cache, nothing worked. After a while I've discovered that this error appears only on https, not http. So I've tried to change SSL cyphers, changed the SSL certificate from Letsencrypt to Comodore, nothing worked. I've updated nginx, still the same problem.

For now I've disabled gzip.

My relevant vhost file is:

listen *:80;
listen *:443 ssl;
ssl_protocols TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2;
ssl_ciphers EECDH+AESGCM:EDH+AESGCM:EECDH:EDH:!MD5:!RC4:!LOW:!MEDIUM:!CAMELLIA:!ECDSA:!DES:!DSS:!3DES:!NULL;
ssl_certificate /path/to/cert.crt;
ssl_certificate_key /path/to/key.key;


The server is a 6 core Xeon with HT, 64 GB RAM and SSD. The SSD is 50% full. Network load is not very high. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Assistant: Reduce the SSL buffer size to 4k:

ssl_buffer_size 4k;
