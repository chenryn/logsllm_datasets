Subject: Trouble Installing lxml (3.1.0) on Python 3.3.0

Dear Support,

I am encountering difficulties while trying to install lxml version 3.1.0 on Python 3.3.0. Although the installation process completes without any errors, and I can see the `lxml-3.1.0-py3.3-linux-i686.egg` file in the correct directory (`/usr/local/lib/python3.3/site-packages/`), I face an issue when attempting to import the `etree` module. The following error message is displayed:

```python
from lxml import etree
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ImportError: /usr/local/lib/python3.3/site-packages/lxml-3.1.0-py3.3-linux-i686.egg/lxml/etree.cpython-33m.so: undefined symbol: xmlBufContent
```

I have tried multiple installation methods, including using `apt-get`, running `python3 setup.py install`, and utilizing `easy_install`. Additionally, I have three versions of Python installed on my system (2.7, 3.2.3, and 3.3.0), though I am not sure if this is related to the problem.

I have searched extensively for a solution but have been unable to find one. Any assistance you could provide would be greatly appreciated.

Best regards,
Uhru

**Response:**

Hello Uhru,

Thank you for reaching out. Based on the information provided, it seems like you are likely using a Linux distribution, possibly Ubuntu or Debian, given your mention of `apt-get`.

The error message you're encountering typically indicates that the `libxml2` and `libxslt` libraries, which are dependencies for `lxml`, are either missing or not properly installed. The installation process may not always detect the absence of these libraries, leading to a false sense of successful installation.

To resolve this issue, please try installing the necessary libraries by running the following command:

```sh
sudo apt-get install libxml2 libxml2-dev libxslt libxslt-dev
```

This should ensure that the required dependencies are present, and the `lxml` installation should then work correctly.

If you continue to experience issues after following these steps, please let me know, and we can explore further troubleshooting options.

Best regards,
