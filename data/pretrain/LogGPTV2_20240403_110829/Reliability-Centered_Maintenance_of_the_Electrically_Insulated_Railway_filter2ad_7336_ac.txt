### Section: Finding Possible Improvements in the Current Policy

To identify potential improvements in the current maintenance policy, the strategy within the Fault Maintenance Tree (FMT) was modified by adjusting inspection frequencies and replacement schedules. This led to a description of how an optimal maintenance strategy for the EI-Joint can be constructed.

The results presented in this section are averages from 40,000 simulation runs. The variance between the simulation runs is low enough that a 95% confidence interval around the mean results has a width less than 1% of the indicated value.

#### A. Current Policy

First, we estimated the total failure rate of the joint over time, as shown in Figure 10. This number is within the margin of error of ProRail’s incident tracking. We observed that after approximately two years, the expected number of failures per year becomes almost constant.

To validate the model, the expected number of occurrences of each failure mode per year was estimated. Table II compares the predicted and actual number of occurrences of each failure mode. ProRail maintains a record of joint failures by cause, and we compared the predicted number of failures to the recorded number. Since the predicted failure rate is almost constant, we assume that the expected failure rate can be multiplied by the number of joints to obtain the total number of failures, regardless of the age of the joints in operation. A graphical breakdown of the causes of failures is displayed in Figure 8.

The difference between actual and predicted failure rates for BE 1 is likely due to inaccurate reporting, as engineers often report only the immediate defect rather than the underlying poor geometry. BEs 2, 4, and 5 concern mechanical failures, which are typically corrected during maintenance before the officially specified threshold is reached.

As an additional validation, we estimated the frequency of joint replacements due to maintenance. Our model predicts approximately 3,680 replacements per year in a population of 50,000 joints. ProRail records indicate approximately 3,000 replacement joints are installed each year. We expect this difference is due to some failure modes where the maintenance action induces a replacement in the model, whereas in real-world scenarios, the degradation may not have progressed far enough to require a full replacement.

Next, we considered the costs associated with the joint. Figure 9 shows the various costs over the lifetime of the joint. As expected from the progression of the cumulative number of failures, the costs also progress very linearly over time. Although these numbers are fictionalized, they do not deviate much from ProRail’s estimates.

#### B. Optimization of Maintenance Policy

Having concluded that the model is a reasonably accurate description of the behavior of the EI-joint, we present some options for improving the reliability and/or costs of the joint.

**Inspection Frequencies:**
We first considered the possibility of performing more or fewer inspections. Figure 10 shows the cumulative expected number of failures over time for different numbers of inspections. We noted that any inspections at all significantly reduce the number of failures, but subsequent increases in the number of inspections have a much smaller effect. This is because failures either occur gradually and are detected even with infrequent inspections, or occur suddenly and are rarely found by any inspection before failing.

In terms of improving reliability, more inspections are always better. However, the results show diminishing returns when increasing the inspection frequency above approximately two per year.

To estimate the cost-optimal number of inspections, we plotted the total cost per year for different inspection frequencies, as shown in Figure 11. As expected, the costs of failures decrease with more inspections, while the costs of inspections increase. The maintenance costs are fairly constant, as increased inspections lead to more necessary repairs, but these repairs are performed sooner.

The optimal number of inspections in terms of total cost is found to be around four inspections per year. The difference in total cost between approximately 2 and 6 inspections per year falls within the margin of error of the simulation, so no more precise optimum can be determined.

**Replacements:**
Several other options for maintenance policies are listed in Table III. We considered always replacing the entire joint when any maintenance is required, adjusting the inspections to take preventive action well before the reference threshold, and periodically replacing the joint regardless of inspection results. We found that all these policies have higher total costs than the reference policy. The reduced threshold on inspections significantly decreases failures for only a modest increase in total cost, but since total cost includes the social cost of failure, we do not consider this a net gain. It is also questionable whether all failure modes show signs of wear sufficiently early to allow this policy to be implemented.

It is likely that the failure rates of the joint vary depending on the intensity of their use. Additionally, the costs of unavailability due to failure or repair increase as the number of passengers passing over the joint increases. We have not precisely determined the correlation of these effects, but we have analyzed the optimal inspection frequency for several variations of costs and failure rates. The optimal inspection frequencies are listed in Table IV, along with the relative cost of the optimal inspection policy compared to the previously computed optimum of 4 inspections per year.

We found that the optimal inspection frequency is primarily determined by the degeneration rate rather than by the cost. Furthermore, the optimal inspection policy has at most a 12 percent cost saving compared to a general policy of four inspections per year.

### Conclusion

We have modeled and analyzed several maintenance policies for the EI-joint via fault maintenance trees. We conclude that obtaining the FMT for the EI-joint was not too difficult from the information in the existing FMECA. Obtaining the right quantitative information required additional effort but was feasible. We found that FMTs naturally model the EI-joint and are a useful tool to investigate different maintenance policies.

One may wonder how surprising it is that the reference maintenance strategy is cost-optimal under the existing circumstances. We argue that it might not be so, because the EI-joint is a well-understood railroad element. Nevertheless, our analysis has provided useful insights into the degradation behavior of the joints, for instance, in critical accelerating factors.

Future work includes extending FMTs with continuous degradation phases, models that take into account specific conditions and usage scenarios that influence degradation. Additional work could include different analysis techniques such as rare-event simulation or analytic approaches that could allow FMTs to be used for systems where highly improbable events have significant effects.

### Appendix

To obtain information about the failure behavior of the components of the EI-joints, a questionnaire was sent to several experts. The exact questions were:

1. What is the average time until this failure mode occurs, assuming no maintenance is performed?
2. Are there conditions that occur regularly and significantly affect the time to failure? If so, what are these conditions, and what effect do they have on the time to failure?
3. Which of the graphs best describes the degeneration behavior of this failure mode? [The graphs in Figure 7 were included.]
4. If an inspection is performed around half the expected time to failure, is it likely that clear signs of wear will be found?
5. If an inspection near the expected time to failure does not find indications of wear, is it likely this failure mode will occur much later than estimated?
6. Does this failure mode frequently occur shortly after installation?
7. How often does this failure mode occur before less than half the expected time has passed?
8. How often does this failure mode only occur later than 1.2 times the expected time?
9. How often does an inspection lead to a maintenance action?
10. If an inspection shows a need for maintenance, how soon after the inspection must this maintenance be performed to prevent failure?
