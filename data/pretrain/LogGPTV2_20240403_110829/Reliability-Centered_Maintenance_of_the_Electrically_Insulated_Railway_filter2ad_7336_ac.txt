ﬁnding possible improvements of the current policy. Therefore,
the maintenance strategy within the FMT was modiﬁed by
changing inspection frequencies and replacements. This led to
a description of how an optimal maintenance strategy of the
EI-Joint can be constructed.
Note that the results in this section are averages of 40,000
simulation runs each. The variance between the simulation runs
is low enough that a 95% conﬁdence interval around the mean
results has a width less than 1% of the indicated value.
A. Current policy
First, we estimate the total failure rate of the joint over
time, shown in Figure 10. This number is within the margin of
error of ProRail’s incident tracking. We further note that after
approximately two years, the expected number of failures per
year is almost constant.
To validate the model, the expected number of occurrences
of each failure mode per year was estimated. Table II shows
the predicted and actual number of occurrences of each failure
mode. Note that ProRail maintains a record of joint failures
by cause, and we compare the predicted number of failures to
the recorded number. Since the predicted failure rate is almost
constant, we assume we can multiply the expected failure rate
by the number of joints to obtain the total number of failures,
regardless of the age of the joints in operation. A graphical
breakdown of the causes of failures is displayed in Figure 8.
The difference between actual and predicted failure rates
for BE 1 is likely explained by inaccurate reporting, as
engineers often report only the immediate defect rather than the
underlying poor geometry. BEs 2, 4, and 5 concern mechanical
failures, which are typically often corrected during mainte-
nance before the ofﬁcially speciﬁed threshold is reached.
As an additional validation, we estimate how often a joint
is replaced due to maintenance. Our model predicts approx.
3680 replacements per year, on a population of 50,000 joints.

Nr. of inspections per year
ProRail records indicate approx. 3000 replacement joints are
installed each year. We expect that this difference is due to
some failure modes where the maintenance action induces a
replacement in the model, whereas in some cases in the real
system the degradation may not has progressed so far, resulting
in only a minor maintenance action.
Next, we consider the costs of the joint. Figure 9 shows the
various costs over the lifetime of the joint. As can be expected
from the progression of the cumulative number of failures,
also the costs progress very linearly over time. Although these
numbers are ﬁctionalized, the actual values do not deviate
much from ProRail’s estimate.
B. Optimization of maintenance policy
Having concluded that the model is a reasonably accurate
description of the behaviour of the EI-joint, we present some
options for improving the reliability and/or costs of the joint.
Inspection frequencies. First, we consider the possibility of
performing more or fewer inspections. Figure 10 shows the
cumulative expected number of failures over time for different
numbers of inspections. We note that
the introduction of
any inspections at all signiﬁcantly reduces the number of
failures, but subsequent increases of the number of inspections
have a much smaller effect. This is due to failures either
occurring gradually and being detected even with infrequent
inspections, or occurring suddenly, and rarely being found by
any inspection before failing.
In terms of improving reliability, clearly more inspections
are always better. Nonetheless, these results show diminish-
ing returns when increasing the inspection frequency above
approximately two per year.
To estimate the cost-optimal number of inspections, we
plot the total cost per year for different inspection frequencies,
Fig. 11.
inspection frequency.
Different types of total costs for one joint, depending on the
shown in Figure 11. As expected, the costs of failures decrease
with more inspections, while the costs of inspections increase.
The maintenance costs are fairly constant, as increased inspec-
tions do lead to more necessary repairs, only repairs performed
sooner.
The optimal number of inspections in terms of total cost
is found around four inspections per year. The difference in
total cost between approx. 2 and 6 inspections per year falls
within the margin or error of the simulation, so no more precise
optimum can be determined.
Replacements. Several other options for maintenance policies
are listed in Table III. We consider always replacing the
entire joint when any maintenance is required, adjusting the
inspections to take preventive action well before the reference
threshold, and periodically replacing the joint regardless of
inspection result. We again ﬁnd that all these policies have
higher total cost than the reference policy. The reduced thresh-
old on inspections does signiﬁcantly decrease failures for only
a modest increase in total cost, but since total cost includes
the social cost of failure, we do not consider this a net gain. It
is also questionable whether all failure modes show signs of
wear sufﬁciently early to allow this policy to be implemented.
It is likely that the failure rates of the joint vary depending
the intensity of their use. Additionally, costs of unavailability
due to failure or repair increase as the number of passengers
passing over the joint increases. We have not precisely deter-
mined the correlation of these effects, but we have analysed the
optimal inspection frequency for several variations of costs and
failure rates. The optimal inspection frequencies are listed in
Table IV, as well as the relative cost of the optimal inspection

policy compared to the previously computed optimum of 4
inspections per year.
We ﬁnd that the optimal inspection frequency is determined
primarily by the degeneration rate, rather than by the cost.
Furthermore, the optimal inspection policy has at most a 12
percent cost saving compared to a general policy of four
inspections per year.
VI. CONCLUSION
tool
We have modeled and analyzed several maintenance poli-
cies for the EI-joint via fault maintenance trees. We conclude
that obtaining the FMT for the EI-joint was not too difﬁcult
from the information in the existing FMECA. Obtaining the
right quantitative information required additional effort, but
was feasible as well. We found that FMTs naturally model
the EI-joint, and is a useful
to investigate different
maintenance policies.
One may wonder how surprising it is that the reference
maintenance strategy is cost optimal under the existing cir-
cumstances. We argue that it might not be so, because the
EI-joint is a well-understood railroad element. Nevertheless,
our analysis has provided useful insights in the degradation
behavior of the joints, for instance in critical accelerating
factors.
Future work includes the extension of FMTs with continu-
ous degradation phases, models that take into account speciﬁc
conditions and usage scenarios that
inﬂuence degradation.
Additional work could include different analysis techniques
such as rare-event simulation or analytic approaches that could
allow FMTs to be used for systems where highly improbable
events have signiﬁcant effects.

To obtain information about the failure behaviour of the compo-

exact questions were:
1) What is the average time until this failure mode occurs, assum-
ing no maintenance is performed?
Are there conditions that occur regularly and signiﬁcantly affect
the time to failure? If so, what are these conditions and what
effect to they have on the time to failure?
