**Abstract:**
Smartphones connected to cellular networks are increasingly being used to access Internet-based services. Using data collected from smartphones running a popular location-based application, we examine IP address allocation in cellular data networks, with an emphasis on understanding the applicability of IP-based geolocation techniques. Our dataset includes GPS-based location data for approximately 29,000 cellular network-assigned IP addresses across 50 different countries. This dataset provides insights into the global deployment of cellular networks. For instance, we find that Network Address Translation (NAT) is common in cellular networks. We also observe service differentiation, where operators assign public IP addresses to some devices and private IP addresses to others. Additionally, we evaluate the accuracy of geolocation databases in determining the position of smartphones and find that the error is 100 km or more for approximately 70% of our measurements. There is potential for errors at the scale of inter-country and inter-continental distances. We believe this dataset may be valuable to the research community and provide a subset of the dataset for public use.

## 1. Introduction

Estimating the geographical location of Internet hosts has numerous applications, including targeted marketing, user profiling, fraud detection, regulatory compliance, digital rights management, and server or content distribution network performance tuning. Many streaming media services, for example, restrict content access based on the user’s geographic location to comply with region-specific licensing arrangements. One popular approach to geolocation is the use of database services such as Maxmind [2] and IPinfoDB [1], which maintain exhaustive tables of IP prefix-to-location matches. However, dynamic assignment of IP addresses, increased fragmentation of IP address blocks, and extensive use of middleboxes make IP-based geolocation extremely challenging.

In this paper, we examine IP address allocation in cellular data networks, focusing on the feasibility of IP-based geolocation techniques. This is an important problem because smartphones connected to cellular networks are increasingly being used to access Internet-based services. While customized smartphone applications can use built-in Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers to obtain accurate location information, alternative geolocation techniques are necessary when a service is accessed through the phone’s browser or when GPS-based tracking is disabled (e.g., due to privacy concerns). The IP geolocation problem has not received much attention in the context of cellular data networks, and we fill this gap by instrumenting a popular location-based iOS application to collect and analyze a dataset with GPS-based location data for approximately 29,000 cellular network-assigned IP addresses, obtained from several thousand individual smartphones spread across 50 countries.

This paper makes several contributions. First, we characterize the dataset and offer insights into the global deployments of cellular data networks. For instance, we find that NAT and other middleboxes are widely deployed in cellular networks worldwide. We also provide evidence of service differentiation, where a provider assigns publicly visible IP addresses to some users, while others are behind NAT boxes. Second, we study the accuracy of geolocation databases and show that the error is 200 km or more in 50% of our measurements. Further, we observe large errors due to mobile operators' implementation of roaming functionality, which is expected to become a more common problem as roaming traffic charges drop. Finally, we provide an original dataset to the community, with an unprecedented number of ground truth measurements of IP-to-geolocation mapping for cellular data networks.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents an overview of related work. Our data collection method and a preliminary analysis of the dataset are presented in Section 3. An analysis of the IP addresses observed in our dataset is presented in Section 4. Section 5 concludes the paper.

## 2. Related Work

The problem of geolocating hosts in networks has been widely studied [8]. Techniques range from measuring packet latencies to landmark nodes and then estimating their location relative to these nodes [6–8], applying machine learning to ground truth datasets [5], or using tabular storage of IP prefixes and associated locations (‘GeoIP databases’) [1, 2]. The accuracy of GeoIP databases has also been debated [9, 10]. For instance, Poese et al. [9] recently evaluated the accuracy of several GeoIP databases using ground truth information from several Points of Presence (POP) locations from one European wired ISP and found that while most GeoIP databases can claim accuracy at the country level, their databases are heavily biased towards a few countries.

The HTML5 Geolocation API [3] allows browsers to report a device’s position. The source of location data is implementation-dependent and can be obtained from GPS receivers, WiFi network location databases, or other means. It is still early days for this solution, and geolocation databases are likely to remain a popular method for many reasons, including privacy concerns associated with fine-grained location tracking.

Closely related to our work are recent studies by Balakrishnan et al. [4], Xu et al. [12], and Wang et al. [11]. For mobile devices connected through 3G networks, Balakrishnan et al. [4] studied the accuracy of GeoIP databases, client/server latencies, and IP address ‘stickiness’. Their study, while comprehensive, is based on three datasets with a maximum of about 100 devices, over a single mobile operator network in the US. Xu et al. [12] combined several data sources to discover cellular network infrastructure. Their work relied on server logs, DNS request logs, and publicly available routing updates to characterize four major US cellular carrier networks. Xu et al. evaluated the cellular network diameter and demonstrated how this could affect content placement strategies. Wang et al. [11] characterized NAT, firewalls, and other security policies deployed in more than 100 cellular IP networks.

We believe our work complements these recent efforts [4, 11, 12]. Our novel dataset includes ground truth information on the location of mobile devices, allowing us to evaluate how well GeoIP databases perform for IP addresses assigned by cellular networks. Additionally, our dataset provides an opportunity to study IP address assignment at a larger scale than previous studies and across carriers in many different countries.

## 3. Dataset and Preliminary Analysis

### 3.1 Dataset

The use of third-party smartphone applications has exploded in recent years, thanks to the phenomenal success of the ‘App Store’ model. These third-party applications present an unprecedented opportunity for crowd-sourcing network measurements from mobile networks. For this work, we partnered with the developer of a location-based iOS application to add minimal instrumentation code so that the application's Internet-based server logs reported the device’s local IP address. This reporting is only done when the device is using the 3G/GPRS interface for communication.

The application is available only on Apple devices running the iOS operating system and has been downloaded by 140,000 users from 50 countries, with particular popularity in Germany and Australia. The application developer provided us with processed data from their server logs. The raw dataset consists of 29,043 measurement points, collected from 11,230 unique smartphones between May and August 2011. The information available is detailed in Table 1.

| **Field** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| Unique ID | Per device, unique ID (fully anonymized) |
| Timestamp | Time at server when measurement was recorded |
| Interface IP Address | IP address assigned to the Cellular Data interface |
| Observed IP Address | Device IP address, as observed at the application’s server |
| Location | Latitude/Longitude coordinates |
| Horizontal Accuracy | Accuracy, in meters, of the location measurement |

This dataset can be obtained by contacting the authors. For privacy reasons, the released dataset will not provide the exact location data but instead will include the corresponding country and city-level information available from the Google reverse geocoding service. The released dataset will include the observed IP address but not the Interface IP address. Instead, we include two boolean flags to indicate whether the device IP address was in the private IANA space and whether it was different from the observed IP address. Finally, the device ID and horizontal accuracy are also removed. This transformation improves user privacy while providing the information required to confirm the key results of this paper and develop new findings.

### 3.2 Geographical Coverage

Before analyzing the collected data, we applied a few simple filtering rules. Note that the number of measurements from a particular device depends on the frequency with which the owner of the device interacts with the application. To avoid recording multiple instances of identical information, for each smartphone, we discard a measurement point if all the following conditions are met, compared to the previous measurement point: i) both the device and observed IP address are unchanged, ii) the distance between the measurement locations is less than 1 km, and iii) the time elapsed since the previous measurement is less than 3 hours. After preprocessing, we are left with 27,328 measurements. We then applied the Google reverse-geocoding service to obtain city and country information from the GPS coordinates. We successfully looked up 26,566 dataset entries. The remainder of this paper focuses on this filtered dataset. In total, we have measurements from 1,924 cities in 50 different countries, as summarized in Table 2 and illustrated in Figure 1.

Devices running iOS use a proprietary ‘Assisted GPS’ method to optimize the device location computation, combining GPS data and a proprietary WiFi geo-database. The 3G iPhone’s Assisted GPS typically has horizontal accuracy errors of 10-15 m [13]. The iOS application programmer can retrieve the accuracy level, in meters, associated with any GPS location measurement. This horizontal accuracy value was available for 97% of our measurement points, and these indicate that 78% of the GPS location information is accurate to 100 m, and 93% is accurate to at least 1 km.

### 3.3 Limitations

Our dataset constitutes a sample of smartphone locations worldwide, the IP address assigned by the cellular data network to these smartphones, and the IP address from which these devices are visible on the Internet. The main drawback of this application-driven measurement method is the spatial and temporal sampling bias introduced as the measurement occurrences are driven by: i) the adoption rate of the smartphone type/OS on which the application is available, ii) the application adoption rate and the spatial distribution of its adopters, and iii) the application usage rate and spatial pattern, which is dependent on the application’s intended use. However, to our knowledge, this dataset is the first of its kind to be available to the research community.

### 4.1 Public IPs, Private IPs, and Middleboxes

With the number of Internet-enabled smartphones exploding and the increased scarcity of available IPv4 address space, mobile operators are likely to rely on Network Address Translation (NAT) and other middleboxes. Table 3 summarizes the IP allocation statistics for the top 15 networks in our dataset, showing the total number of devices with only private IP addresses and only public IP addresses.
