### 5. Case Studies

In this section, we investigate the recipient accounts of online payments used by illegal gambling websites during the tracing period. We also attempt to withdraw money from these illegal gambling sites to verify their trustworthiness. Additionally, we inspect the variation in gambling types during the 2018 FIFA World Cup and observe a significant increase in soccer gambling websites during that period.

#### 5.1 Recipient Accounts

There are two primary reasons why illegal online gambling websites frequently change their recipient accounts for online payments:

1. **Avoid Tracking**: The owners of gambling websites are required to provide authentic personal information when opening banking accounts, which can lead to tracking. To avoid this, they frequently change their recipient accounts.
2. **Malicious Reporting from Competitors**: Given the high profits in online gambling, competition is fierce. Losing competitors often submit the winners' information to supervisory organizations to cause trouble. Therefore, frequent changes in recipient accounts are common.

**Figure 7: Changes in Recipient Accounts Over One Month**

To demonstrate the frequency of recipient account changes, we traced 100 illegal gambling sites over one month (from August 1st to August 31st, 2018). These sites had various IP addresses, WHOIS information, and templates, indicating they were not owned by the same entity. We built a crawler to visit the payment page of each site daily and collect recipient account information. The results showed that 56 sites changed their recipient accounts, and 43 of them also changed their payment channels during the same period.

#### 5.2 Trustworthiness of Illegal Gambling Sites

Illegal online gambling sites operate as part of the underground economy to generate substantial profits. Their trustworthiness is determined by whether they honor players' withdrawal requests. If a request is declined or delayed, the player is likely to lose their deposited money. To measure this, we made deposits in 20 gambling sites and immediately attempted to withdraw the funds without playing any games. We successfully withdrew from only 8 sites. For the remaining 12 sites, customer service informed us that the withdrawal process would take about one week. However, even after two months, we did not receive any withdrawals, indicating that a significant proportion of illegal gambling sites are untrustworthy and gain profits through cheating.

#### 5.3 Gambling Type Migration

Illegal online gambling sites adjust their gambling types based on social trends to attract more players, such as during the FIFA World Cup. We conducted a study on the change in gambling types during the 2018 FIFA World Cup. We traced 10,000 illegal gambling sites from June 1st to June 30th, 2018, crawling their homepages daily to collect soccer gambling content. Figure 8 shows the varying number of soccer gambling websites. During the World Cup, there was a significant increase in soccer gambling websites, with 7,372 sites offering soccer gambling games. This indicates that gambling sites adapt their content to hot events, and it is easy and convenient for illegal gambling site owners to create different types of gambling websites.

### 7. Conclusion

In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of illegal online gambling ecosystems targeting Chinese players. We identify illegal gambling websites from blackhat SEO pages and characterize the abuse of third-party online payment, outsourcing customer services, and third-party cloud storage services. Our measurement study on the profit chain of illegal online gambling reveals that third-party online services, such as image hosting infrastructures and outsourcing customer services, involuntarily help miscreants run gambling websites. We also find that third-party online payment channels (e.g., Alipay and WeChat Pay) play a key role in the profit chain of illegal online gambling, which can be leveraged to combat these activities.
