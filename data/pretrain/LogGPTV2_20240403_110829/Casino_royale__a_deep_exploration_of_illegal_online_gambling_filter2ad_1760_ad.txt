gambling websites to verify their trustworthiness. We also in-
spect the variation of gambling types during the FIFA World
Cup 2018 and show a burst of soccer gambling websites
during that period.
5.1 Recipient Account
There are two main reasons why illegal online gambling web-
sites change their recipient accounts of online payment: (1)
Avoid being tracked. The owners of gambling websites are re-
quired to provide authentic personal information when they
open banking accounts, which results in the possibility of
being tracked. Therefore, they vary their recipient accounts
of online payment to avoid the tracking. (2) Malicious re-
port from peer competitors. Since online gambling has very
high profits, the competition is fierce. The losers will sub-
mit the information of winners to supervision organizations,
with the purpose of bringing troubles to them. So, frequently
changing recipient account is a common phenomenon in
online gambling websites.
Figure 7: The Change of Recipient Account within
One Month.
Figure 8: Soccer Gambling Websites Change During
FIFA World Cup.
To demonstrate how frequently a recipient account of on-
line payment changes, we trace 100 illegal gambling sites for
one months (from August 1st to August 31st, 2018). Without
loss of generality, the selected illegal gambling sites have
various IP addresses, WHOIS information, and templates,
such that these gambling sites are not from the same owner.
The payment channels and recipient accounts that they use
are also different. During this period, we build a crawler
to visit the payment page of each gambling site every day,
and collect the recipient account information. The result
shows that 56 sites change their recipient accounts during
the period. Besides recipient account, they also change the
payment channels, and 43 of them change their payment
channels during the same period. The dynamics of account
change is shown in Figure 7.
5.2 Trustworthiness of illegal gambling
sites
As we know, illegal online gambling sites act as a part of
underground economy to gain enormous profits. Whether
or not gambling sites grant the request of a player’s money
withdrawal determines their trustworthiness. If the request is
declined or delayed to process, the player likely will lose the
deposited money. This inspires us to conduct a measurement
study on how easy or difficult to withdraw the deposited
money from gambling sites.
To illustrate whether illegal gambling sites allow players to
withdraw money anytime as they claimed, we make deposits
in 20 gambling sites. We do not play any games and withdraw
the deposited money right after making the payment. We
withdraw successfully only from 8 sites. Then we contact
with customer services belong to the other 12 sites, and they
inform us that the withdrawal process will finish in about
one week. However, we have not received any withdrawal
money even two months later. This shows that a significant
proportion of illegal gambling sites are not trustworthy and
they gain profits even by cheating on players.
5.3 Gambling type migration
Illegal online gambling sites change their gambling types
based on social trending events to attract more players, such
as FIFA World Cup. We conduct a measurement study on the
change of gambling type during the FIFA World Cup 2018.
We trace 10,000 illegal gambling sites from June 1st to June
30th, 2018 during the period of FIFA World Cup. We crawl
the homepage of these gambling sites each day, and collect
the soccer gambling content. Figure 8 shows the varying
number of soccer gambling websites. We can see that during
the World Cup, there are a burst of soccer gambling websites:
7,372 of them have soccer gambling games. This indicates
that the gambling sites adjust their content according to the
hot events. And it also implies that it is easy and convenient
for illegal gambling site owners to create a different type of
gambling websites.
6 RELATED WORK
In [19], Chris et al. analyzed the benefit chain of spam (a
type of blackhat SEO) in underground economy. In [20],
Damon et al. explained the complex role of payment pro-
cessing in monetizing of abuse-advertised goods. In [34],
Wang et al. inspected the effectiveness of interventions in
counterfeit luxury goods promotions and investigated un-
derground economy from blackhat SEO sites. In [31], Kurt
et al. discussed ad injection while users visiting the Internet
and identified a set of malicious software. In [16], Thomas
et al. conducted a survey on the flow of capital within the
black market and discussed the emerging market of modern
criminal entrepreneurs that incorporated dozens of compo-
nents into entirely new criminal endeavors. In [27], Rafique
et al. presented an analysis of the free live streaming service
ecosystem. In previous studies [21], [4], [17], researchers
showed that illegal online services often exploit the shared
domain or shared domain hosting facilities for malicious
purposes, which is similar to the abuse of network infras-
tructures by gambling sites.
In [23], Portnoff et al. proposed an automated top-down
approach for analyzing underground forums and distinguish-
ing black pages from white ones. In [9], Greg et al. developed
a method for identifying products being bought and sold
in online cybercrime forums by using NLP models. In our
work, we employ NLP models to distinguish gambling games.
In [6], Brunt et al. analyzed the payment intervention on
a DDoS-for-Hire service, and showed that customers had
switched from a regulated payment method to Bitcoin. We
also analyzed the payment for illegal gambling sites. The
difference is that illegal gambling sites prefer to use online
payment rather than Bitcoin. In [32], Tian et al. examined
the effectiveness of payment by Visa Asia against banks and
found the Bank of China supported counterfeit luxury goods
merchants continuously for two year research period. In
[33], Rolf et al. tracked the evolution of commoditization on
underground markets and identified the market supply for
most components.
7 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we conduct the first comprehensive analysis
on illegal online gambling ecosystems that target Chinese
players. We identify illegal gambling websites from blackhat
SEO pages and characterize the abuse of third-party online
payment, outsourcing customer services, and third-party
cloud storage services. We conduct a measurement study on
the profit chain of illegal online gambling. We observe that
third-party online services involuntarily help miscreants run
gambling websites, such as image hosting infrastructures and
outsourcing customer services. We also find that third-party
online payment channels (e.g., Alipay and WeChat pay) play
a key role in the profit chain of illegal online gambling, which
can thus be leveraged to thwart illegal online gambling.
