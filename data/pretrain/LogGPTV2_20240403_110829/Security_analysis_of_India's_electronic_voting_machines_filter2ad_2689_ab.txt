the system is a major concern. The current EVMs are built
from inexpensive commodity parts and cost approximately
$200 for each set of units [35], far less than many DREs used
in the U.S., which cost several thousand dollars.
Power Many polling places are located in areas that lack
electricity service or have only intermittent service. Thus,
the EVMs operate entirely from battery power, rather than
merely using a battery as a backup.
3Natural Hazards
India’s varied climate has great ex-
tremes of temperature, as well as other environmental hazards
such as dust and pollution. EVMs must be operated under
these adverse conditions and must be stored for long periods
in facilities that lack climate control. An Election Commis-
sion report cites further dangers from “attack by vermin,
rats, fungus or due to mechanical danger, [that might cause]
malfunction” [1].
Illiteracy Though many Indian voters are well educated,
many others are illiterate. The country’s literacy rate in
2007 was 66% [56], and only about 55% among women, so
handling illiterate voters must be the rule rather than the
exception. Thus, ballots feature graphical party symbols as
well as candidate names, and the machines are designed to
be used without written instructions.
Unfamiliarity with Technology Some voters in India
have very little experience with technology and may be in-
timidated by electronic voting. For example, “Fifty-year-old
Hasulal Topno [... an] impoverished Oraon tribal, who gath-
ers ﬁrewood from the forest outlying the Palamau Tiger
Reserve, a Maoist hotbed 35 km from Daltonganj town” told
a reporter, “I am scared of the voting machine,” prior to its
introduction in his village [13]. Nirmal Ho, “a tribal and
a marginal farmhand in the Chatarpur block of Palamau
district,” said he was “more scared of the EVMs than the
Maoists” on account of his unfamiliarity with technology. To
avoid further intimidating voters like these, India’s EVMs
require the voter to press only a single button.
Booth Capture A serious threat against paper voting
before the introduction of EVMs was booth capture, a less-
than-subtle type of electoral fraud found primarily in India,
wherein party loyalists would take over a polling station by
force and stuﬀ the ballot box. Better policing makes such
attacks less of a threat today, but the EVMs have also been
designed to discourage them by limiting the rate of vote
casting to ﬁve per minute [1].
Any voting system proposed for use in India must be able to
function under these constraints.
2.4 Ofﬁcial EVM Security Reviews
There have been two oﬃcial technical evaluations of EVM
security performed at the behest of the Election Commis-
sion. The ﬁrst was conducted in 1990 prior to the decision
to introduce EVMs on a national scale, in response to “ap-
prehensions articulated by leaders of political parties” about
the machines’ security. The study [35] was conducted by
an “expert committee” composed of C. Rao Kasarbada, P.V.
Indiresan, and S. Sampath, none of whom appear to have had
prior computer security expertise. The committee had no
access to EVM source code; instead, it relied on presentations
and demonstrations by the manufacturers. Their report iden-
tiﬁes two potential attacks: replacing the entire system with
a fake one, and inserting a device between the ballot unit
cable and the control unit. Both attacks, the report states,
can be defeated by inspection of the machine. In the report’s
conclusion, the committee “unanimously certiﬁed that the
System is tamperproof in the intended environment.”
The Election Commission conducted a second “expert com-
mittee” study [1] in 2006 to evaluate upgrades for the third-
generation EVMs. This time the committee members were
A.K. Agarwala and D.T. Shahani, with P.V. Indiresan serv-
ing as chair. All three were aﬃliated with IIT Delhi, but, like
the ﬁrst committee, none appear to have had prior computer
security expertise. Again, the committee members did not
have access to EVM source code and relied on presentations,
demonstrations, and site visits with the manufacturers. In
their report, the commission reiterated the belief that the
machines were “tamper-proof”; however, they also recom-
mended a small number of changes to enhance the security
of the machines. These included the adoption of “dynamic
key coding” of button presses from the ballot unit, to protect
against simplistic attacks on the cable, and the addition of a
real-time clock and time-stamped logging of every key press,
even if invalid, to provide a record of any attempt to activate
malicious logic by a “secret knock.” Some of these changes
were adopted in third-generation EVMs, but they cannot
prevent the attacks we demonstrate in this paper. We discuss
implications of these safeguards in Section 5.
2.5 Reports of Irregularities
In recent years there have been numerous allegations and
press reports of election irregularities involving Indian EVMs.
It is diﬃcult to assess the credibility of these charges, since
there has apparently never been a prosecution related to
EVM fraud, and there has never been a post-election audit
to attempt to understand the causes [50, p. 54]. Nevertheless,
they paint a troubling picture of election security in India.
Reports of malfunctions have been extensively surveyed
by Rao [50]. For instance, he relates that in the 2009 parlia-
mentary election there were reported EVM malfunctions in
more than 15 parliamentary constituencies across the country.
Especially troubling are claims that when the voter pressed
a button for one candidate, a light would ﬂash for another,
which could be explained by a simple attack on the EVM
cable [50, p. 45]. Rao also relates reports from prominent
politicians that engineers approached them in 2009 oﬀering
to ﬁx elections through this method [50, pp. 60–61].
Despite these incidents, experts for the Election Commis-
sion have equated any questioning of the security of the
EVMs with an attack on the commission’s own impartiality
and integrity [50, p. 98]. In a television interview, P.V. Indire-
san, who chaired the Election Commission’s 2006 technical
review, went as far as to liken doubting the security of the
EVMs to “asking Sita to prove her virginity [sic] by having
Agni pariksha [trial by ﬁre]” (a reference to a famous episode
in the Ramayana) [18].
We have had direct experience with attempted fraud. Hari
Prasad, a coauthor of this study, was approached in October
2009 by representatives of a prominent regional party who
oﬀered to pay for his technical assistance ﬁxing elections.
They were promptly and sternly refused.
2.6 EVM Hardware Design
The manufacturers and the Election Commission have
never released a detailed technical description of the EVMs’
inner workings, citing security and intellectual property con-
cerns [28]. We will now describe the hardware of the EVM
we examined, based on our own observations and testing.
Control Unit Main Board The control unit contains
the main circuit board, shown in Figure 3. The centerpiece is
the EVM’s CPU, a Renesas H8/3644-series microcontroller
driven by an 8.8672 MHz crystal oscillator. The CPU is cus-
tom manufactured with the election software permanently
recorded in an internal mask ROM. This prevents the soft-
ware from being electronically reprogrammed. Also on the
4main circuit board are the switches for the buttons on the
face of the device, a buzzer, two EEPROM chips used for
nonvolatile storage of vote data, the display board connector,
and the connector for the ballot unit.
Control Unit Display Board The display board, shown
in Figure 3(c), holds “Power” and “Busy” LEDs, as well as six
7-segment LED digits. It connects to the main board via a
16-pin ribbon cable. It implements a simple circuit in which
the control unit main board directly drives the 7-segment
LEDs. The CPU illuminates one 7-segment digit at a time,
rapidly cycling through them to give the appearance that
they are all lit continuously.
Ballot Unit Board The ballot unit board is also a very
simple device. It has no CPU of its own; instead, it uses
two electronically programmable logic devices (EPLDs) to
interpret signals from the control unit CPU and interface
with the candidate buttons and LEDs on its face. It also
contains a four-position switch used to select the ballot unit’s
position in a multi-unit chain.
Ballot Unit Communication The control unit and the
ballot unit are connected through a 5 m cable with one end
connected to the 15-pin ballot port on the control unit main
board and the other end ﬁxed permanently inside the ballot
unit. The the control unit initiates communication by sending
the number of the ballot unit it wants to query. The ﬁrst
EPLD in each ballot unit reads this number, compares it to
the position of the unit’s four-position switch, and activates
the second EPLD if the two numbers match. The second
EPLD on the active ballot unit scans the candidate buttons
and, if one is pressed, it communicates that information
back to the control unit. The control unit then signals the
ﬁrst EPLD to activate the corresponding LED, indicating a
successful vote. If no button is pressed on the active ballot
unit, the control unit tries the next ballot unit in the chain.
Software Despite design features that make the election
software diﬃcult to extract from the control unit processor,
a real criminal would have a variety of options for reading
it out, including decapsulating the chip and examining it
under a microscope [2]. Since we did not have permission
to render our EVM unusable, we did not attempt to extract
the software by these methods; however, once the software
was extracted, reverse engineering would be straightforward
using standard disassembly tools (e.g., [32]).
3. VULNERABILITY ANALYSIS
Prior studies of electronic voting security have recom-
mended avoiding complexity and minimizing the size of the
trusted computing base. In light of this advice, India’s EVMs
might superﬁcially appear to be superior to most other de-
ployed DREs. The EVMs use a simple embedded system
design, as described in the previous section, and while many
other DREs rely on commodity operating systems and run
election software containing tens or hundreds of thousands
of lines of code, the EVM software is compact, consisting of
only a few thousand instructions that run directly on the
hardware. Nevertheless, as we will explain, this has not
resulted in a secure system.
In this section, we describe a number of ways that attackers
could manipulate the EVMs. These attacks are possible even
if the voting software is completely error-free. Many of them
could be performed once and then continue to inﬂuence
(a) Inside the control unit
(b) Main board (detail )
(c) Display board
Figure 3: EVM Hardware — The hardware inside the
EVM (a) has never before been subjected to detailed public
scrutiny. Most of the machine’s logic is contained on the
control unit main board, including the processor (b, rear)
and two EEPROM memory chips that store the vote data
(b, center). Election results and other output are shown
on a smaller display board (c), which is a simple electric
circuit containing only LEDs and a connector. Note that the
7-segment LEDs are raised slightly by a black plastic spacer.
5election outcomes for the life of the machine. Signiﬁcantly,
we ﬁnd that while the simple design of the EVMs makes
certain software-based attacks less likely than in other DREs,
it makes attacks involving physical tampering far easier.
Tampering with Software before CPU Manufacture
The EVM ﬁrmware is stored in masked read-only memory
inside the microcontroller chips, and there is no provision for
extracting it or verifying its integrity. This means that if the
software was modiﬁed before it was built into the CPUs, the
changes would be very diﬃcult to detect.
The software is integrated into the CPU by the manufac-
turer, Renesas, a Japanese company. (Other EVM models
use CPUs made by Microchip, an American company.) Con-
sider the engineer responsible for compiling the source code
and transmitting it to the CPU manufacturer. He or she
could substitute a version containing a back door with lit-
tle chance of being caught. This fact alone would be great
temptation for fraud.
Similarly, employees at the chipmakers could alter the
compiled program image before burning it into the chips.
While more involved than modifying source code, reverse
engineering ﬁrmware of such low complexity is not diﬃcult
and has been done (sometimes within a few weeks) with other
voting systems in the context of academic research [17,29,30].
Substituting Look-Alike CPUs After the software is
burned into the CPUs by the foreign chipmakers, these CPUs
are shipped to India to be assembled into the control unit
main boards. Attackers might try to substitute look-alike
CPUs containing software that counts the votes dishonestly.
Other than the ﬁrmware, the CPUs are a commodity part,
so obtaining and programming identical hardware would be
straightforward. The EVM designers could have made such
attacks more diﬃcult by building a cryptographic mecha-
nism for identifying the original CPUs, such as a challenge-
response protocol based on a secret contained in the original
ﬁrmware. Since they did not, this attack would only require
creating new software with nearly identical functionality to
the original, a task that is relatively easy because of the
EVMs’ simple design.
The real chips could be swapped with dishonest ones in
the supply chain or by attackers with access to the assembled
machines. Prior to assembly, they could be swapped by
corrupt employees at the chipmakers or the couriers that
transport them. Customs oﬃcials in the exporting countries
could also have an opportunity to swap the chips, perhaps
at the request of foreign intelligence agencies.
In addition to the main CPU used in the control unit, the
programmable logic devices in the ballot unit might also be
targeted in such an attack. A well-funded adversary could
construct a look-alike chip package containing both a radio
receiver and a processor.
Substituting Look-Alike Circuit Boards After the
control unit’s main board is manufactured, swapping in a
dishonest CPU would require desoldering and replacing the
surface-mounted chip, taking a skilled worker with adequate
tools perhaps 10 minutes. However, attackers might ﬁnd it
faster to construct an electrically-compatible dishonest main
board and substitute it for the original. Making a new board
is relatively easy because of the simple design and function
of this component. Replacing it would only require opening
the control unit, swapping out the snap-ﬁtted board, and
reconnecting the cable to the display unit.
The system also treats its input and output devices as
trusted components. An attacker could steal votes by replac-
ing the circuit board in the ballot unit with one that falsely
responds to key press events, or by replacing the display
board in the control unit with one that reports inaccurate
vote totals. The connections between these components are
trusted too, so an attacker could try to insert a device be-
tween the ballot unit and control unit in order to intercept
the key press signals and replace them with votes for diﬀerent
candidates. These attacks are straightforward because the
machine’s design includes no way for the boards to authenti-
cate each other. We constructed a demonstration dishonest
display board, which we describe in Section 4.1.
Substituting Look-Alike Units Voters and poll work-
ers have no practical way to verify that the EVMs they use
are authentic, so attackers might try to build identical look-
ing but dishonest control units or ballot units and substitute
them before an election. Since the units we examined have no
eﬀective way to verify the authenticity of the units they are
paired to, replacing either unit with a dishonest one would
allow the attacker to alter election results.
Prior to this study, Hari Prasad constructed a proof-of-
concept look-alike EVM. He found that matching the elec-
tronic functionality was easy due to the simple design of the
