• 10 MB for TX Matrix or TX Matrix Plus routers
• 1 MB for the QFX Series
When an active log file called logfile reaches the maximum size, the logging utility closes the file,
compresses it, and names the compressed archive file logfile.0.gz. The logging utility then opens and
writes to a new active file called logfile. This process is also known as file rotation. When the new logfile
reaches the configured maximum size, logfile.0.gz is renamed logfile.1.gz, and the new logfile is closed,
compressed, and renamed logfile.0.gz. By default, the logging utility creates up to 10 archive files in this
manner. When the maximum number of archive files is reached and when the size of the active file
reaches the configured maximum size, the contents of the last archived file are overwritten by the
current active file. The logging utility by default also limits the users who can read log files to the root
user and users who have Junos OS maintenance permission.
Junos OS provides a configuration statement log-rotate-frequency that configures the system log file
rotation frequency by configuring the time interval for checking the log file size. The frequency can be
set to a value of 1 minute through 59 minutes. The default frequency is 15 minutes.
To configure the log rotation frequency, include the log-rotate-frequency statement at the [edit system
syslog] hierarchy level.
You can include the archive statement to change the maximum size of each file, how many archive files
are created, and who can read log files.
To configure values that apply to all log files, include the archive statement at the [edit system syslog]
hierarchy level:
archive   ;
To configure values that apply to a specific log file, include the archive statement at the
[edit system syslog file filename] hierarchy level:
archive )>      ;
archive-sites site-name specifies a list of archive sites that you want to use for storing files. The site-name
value is any valid FTP URL to a destination. If more than one site name is configured, a list of archive
sites for the system log files is created. When a file is archived, the router or switch attempts to transfer
the file to the first URL in the list, moving to the next site only if the transfer does not succeed. The log
file is stored at the archive site with the specified log filename. For information about how to specify
valid FTP URLs, see Format for Specifying Filenames and URLs in Junos OS CLI Commands.
1276
binary-data Mark file as containing binary data. This allows proper archiving of binary files, such as WTMP
files (login records for UNIX based systems). To restore the default setting, include the no-binary-data
statement.
files number specifies the number of files to create before the oldest file is overwritten. The value can be
from 1 through 1000.
size size specifies the maximum size of each file. The value can be from 64 KB (64k) through 1 gigabyte
(1g); to represent megabytes, use the letter m after the integer. There is no space between the digits and
the k, m, or g units letter.
start-time "YYYY-MM-DD.hh:mm" defines the date and time in the local time zone for a one-time transfer of the
active log file to the first reachable site in the list of sites specified by the archive-sites statement.
transfer-interval interval defines the amount of time the current log file remains open (even if it has not
reached the maximum possible size) and receives new statistics before it is closed and transferred to an
archive site. This interval value can be from 5 through 2880 minutes.
world-readable enables all users to read log files. To restore the default permissions, include the no-world-
readable statement.
Include Priority Information in System Log Messages
The facility and severity level of a message are together referred to as its priority. By default, messages
logged in the standard Junos OS format do not include information about priority. To include priority
information in standard-format messages directed to a file, include the explicit-priority statement at the
[edit system syslog file filename] hierarchy level:
[edit system syslog file filename]
facility severity;
explicit-priority;
NOTE: Messages logged in structured-data format include priority information by default. If you
include the structured-data statement at the [edit system syslog file filename] hierarchy level along
with the explicit-priority statement, the explicit-priority statement is ignored and messages are
logged in structured-data format.
For information about the structured-data statement, see "Logging Messages in Structured-Data
Format" on page 1274.
1277
To include priority information in messages directed to a remote machine or the other Routing Engine,
include the explicit-priority statement at the [edit system syslog host (hostname | other-routing-engine)]
hierarchy level:
[edit system syslog host (hostname | other-routing-engine)]
facility severity;
explicit-priority;
NOTE: The other-routing-engine option does not apply to the QFX Series.
The priority recorded in a message always indicates the original, local facility name. If the facility-
override statement is included for messages directed to a remote destination, the Junos OS system
logging utility still uses the alternative facility name for the messages themselves when directing them
to the remote destination. For more information, see "Changing the Alternative Facility Name for System
Log Messages Directed to a Remote Destination" on page 1318.
When the explicit-priority statement is included, the Junos OS logging utility prepends codes for the
facility name and severity level to the message tag name, if the message has one:
FACILITY-severity[-TAG]
(The tag is a unique identifier assigned to some Junos OS system log messages.)
In the following example, the CHASSISD_PARSE_COMPLETE message belongs to the daemon facility and is assigned
severity info (6):
Aug 21 12:36:30 router1 chassisd[522]: %DAEMON-6-CHASSISD_PARSE_COMPLETE: Using new configuration
When the explicit-priority statement is not included, the priority does not appear in the message:
Aug 21 12:36:30 router1 chassisd[522]: CHASSISD_PARSE_COMPLETE: Using new configuration
1278
System Log Facility Codes and Numerical Codes Reported in Priority
Information
Table 130 on page 1278 lists the facility codes that can appear in system log messages and maps them
to facility names.
NOTE: If the second column in Table 130 on page 1278 does not include the Junos OS facility
name for a code, the facility cannot be included in a statement at the [edit system syslog]
hierarchy level. Junos OS might use the facilities in Table 130 on page 1278—and others that are
not listed—when reporting on internal operations.

support representative has instructed you to configure this
severity level)
Include the Year or Millisecond in Timestamps
By default, the timestamp recorded in a standard-format system log message specifies the month, date,
hour, minute, and second when the message was logged, as in the following example:
Aug 21 12:36:30
To include the year, the millisecond, or both in the timestamp, include the time-format statement at the
[edit system syslog] or [edit security log] hierarchy levels:
[edit system syslog]
time-format (year | millisecond | year millisecond);
However, the timestamp for traceoption messages is specified in milliseconds by default, and is
independent of the [edit system syslog time-format] statement.
The modified timestamp is used in messages directed to each destination configured by a file, console, or
user statement at the [edit system syslog] hierarchy level, but not to destinations configured by a host
statement.
1281
NOTE: By default, in a FreeBSD console, the additional time information is not available in
system log messages directed to each destination configured by a host statement. However, in a
Junos OS specific implementation using the FreeBSD console, the additional time information is
available in system log messages directed to each destination.
The following example illustrates the format for a timestamp that includes both the millisecond (401)
and the year (2006):
Aug 21 12:36:30.401 2006
NOTE: Messages logged in structured-data format include the year and millisecond by default. If
you include the structured-data statement at the [edit system syslog file filename] hierarchy level
along with the time-format statement, the time-format statement is ignored and messages are
logged in structured-data format.
For information about the structured-data statement, see "Logging Messages in Structured-Data
Format" on page 1274.
Use Strings and Regular Expressions to Refine the Set of Logged
Messages
The predefined facilities group together related messages, but you can also match messages against
strings and regular expressions to refine which messages from a facility are logged to a file, a user
terminal, or a remote destination.
The match-strings and match configuration statements enable you to match system log messages against a
string or regular expression, respectively. You can include these statements at the following hierarchy
levels:
• [edit system syslog file filename] (for a file)
• [edit system syslog user (username | *)] (for a specific user session or for all user sessions on a terminal)
• [edit system syslog host (hostname | other-routing-engine)] (for a remote destination)
1282
To evaluate messages against a regular expression and only log matching messages to the given
destination, include the match statement and specify the regular expression:
match "regular-expression";
Starting with Junos OS Release 16.1, you can use simple string comparisons to more efficiently filter
messages, because it is less CPU-intensive than matching against complex regular expressions. To
specify the text string that must appear in a message for the message to be logged to a destination,
include the match-strings statement and specify the matching string or list of strings:
match-strings string-name;
match-strings [string1 string2];
The match-strings and match statements select messages with the configured facility and severity that
match the given string or regular expression. The match-strings statement performs a simple string
comparison, and as a result, it is less CPU-intensive than using the match statement to match against
complex regular expressions. If you configure both the match and match-strings statements for the same
destination, Junos OS evaluates the match-strings condition first; if the message includes any of the
configured substrings, then the message is logged and the match condition is not evaluated. If the match-
strings condition is not satisfied, then the system evaluates the message against the regular expression
in the match configuration statement.
When specifying regular expressions for the match statement, use the notation defined in POSIX
Standard 1003.2 for extended (modern) UNIX regular expressions. Explaining regular expression syntax
is beyond the scope of this document, but POSIX standards are available from the Institute of Electrical
and Electronics Engineers (IEEE, http://www.ieee.org).
Table 132 on page 1283 specifies which character or characters are matched by some of the regular
expression operators that you can use in the match statement. In the descriptions, the term term refers
to either a single alphanumeric character or a set of characters enclosed in square brackets, parentheses,
or braces.
NOTE: The match statement is not case-sensitive.
1283
Table 132: Regular Expression Operators for the match Statement
Operator Matches
. (period) One instance of any character except the space.
* (asterisk) Zero or more instances of the immediately preceding term.
+ (plus sign) One or more instances of the immediately preceding term.
? (question mark) Zero or one instance of the immediately preceding term.
| (pipe) One of the terms that appears on either side of the pipe operator.
! (exclamation point) Any string except the one specified by the expression, when the exclamation point
appears at the start of the expression. Use of the exclamation point is Junos OS-
specific.
^ (caret) Start of a line, when the caret appears outside square brackets.
One instance of any character that does not follow it within square brackets, when
the caret is the first character inside square brackets.
$ (dollar sign) End of a line.
[ ] (paired square brackets) One instance of one of the enclosed alphanumeric characters. To indicate a range of
characters, use a hyphen ( - ) to separate the beginning and ending characters of the
range. For example, [a-z0-9] matches any letter or number.
( ) (paired parentheses) One instance of the evaluated value of the enclosed term. Parentheses are used to
indicate the order of evaluation in the regular expression.
Using Strings and Regular Expressions
Filter messages that belong to the interactive-commands facility, directing those that include the string
configure to the terminal of the root user:
[edit system syslog]
user root {
1284
interactive-commands any;
match-strings configure;
}
Messages like the following appear on the root user’s terminal when a user issues a configure command to
enter configuration mode:
timestamp router-name mgd[PID]: UI_CMDLINE_READ_LINE: User 'user', command 'configure private'
Filter messages that belong to the daemon facility and have a severity of error or higher, directing them to
the file /var/log/process-errors. Omit messages generated by the SNMP process (snmpd), instead
directing them to the file /var/log/snmpd-errors:
[edit system syslog]
file process-errors {
daemon error;
match "!(.*snmpd.*)";
}
file snmpd-errors {
daemon error;
match-strings snmpd;
}
Junos System Log Regular Expression Operators for the match Statement
Table 133: Regular Expression Operators for the match Statement
Operator Matches
. (period) One instance of any character except the space.
* (asterisk) Zero or more instances of the immediately preceding term.
+ (plus sign) One or more instances of the immediately preceding term.
1285
Table 133: Regular Expression Operators for the match Statement (Continued)
Operator Matches
? (question mark) Zero or one instance of the immediately preceding term.
| (pipe) One of the terms that appear on either side of the pipe operator.
! (exclamation point) Any string except the one specified by the expression, when the
exclamation point appears at the start of the expression. Use of the
exclamation point is Junos OS–specific.
^ (caret) The start of a line, when the caret appears outside square brackets.
One instance of any character that does not follow it within square
brackets, when the caret is the first character inside square brackets.
$ (dollar sign) The end of a line.
[ ] (paired square brackets) One instance of one of the enclosed alphanumeric characters. To
indicate a range of characters, use a hyphen ( - ) to separate the
beginning and ending characters of the range. For example, [a-z0-9]
matches any letter or number.
( ) (paired parentheses) One instance of the evaluated value of the enclosed term.
Parentheses are used to indicate the order of evaluation in the regular
expression.
Disable the System Logging of a Facility
To disable the logging of messages that belong to a particular facility, include the facility none statement
in the configuration. This statement is useful when, for example, you want to log messages that have the
same severity level and belong to all but a few facilities. Instead of including a statement for each facility
you want to log, you can include the any severity statement and then a facility none statement for each
facility that you do not want to log. For example, the following logs all messages at the error level or
1286
higher to the console, except for messages from the daemon and kernel facilities. Messages from those
facilities are logged to the file >/var/log/internals instead:
[edit system syslog]
console {
any error;
daemon none;
kernel none;
}
file internals {
daemon info;
kernel info;
}
Examples: Configure System Logging
The following example shows how to configure the logging of messages about all commands entered by
users at the CLI prompt or invoked by client applications such as Junos OS XML protocol or NETCONF
client applications, and all authentication or authorization attempts, both to the file cli-commands and
to the terminal of any user who is logged in:
[edit system]
syslog {
file cli-commands {
interactive-commands info;
authorization info;
}
user * {
interactive-commands info;
authorization info;
}
}
The following example shows how to configure the logging of all changes in the state of alarms to the
file /var/log/alarms:
[edit system]
syslog {
1287
file alarms {
kernel warning;
}
}
The following example shows how to configure the handling of messages of various types, as described
in the comments. Information is logged to two files, to the terminal of user alex, to a remote machine,
and to the console:
[edit system]
syslog {
/* write all security-related messages to file /var/log/security */
file security {
authorization info;
interactive-commands info;
}
/* write messages about potential problems to file /var/log/messages: */
/* messages from "authorization" facility at level "notice" and above, */
/* messages from all other facilities at level "warning" and above */
file messages {
authorization notice;
any warning;
}
/* write all messages at level "critical" and above to terminal of user "alex" if */
/* that user is logged in */
user alex {
any critical;
}
/* write all messages from the "daemon" facility at level "info" and above, and */
/* messages from all other facilities at level "warning" and above, to the */
/* machine monitor.mycompany.com */
host monitor.mycompany.com {
daemon info;
any warning;
}
/* write all messages at level "error" and above to the system console */
console {
any error;
}
}
1288
The following example shows how to configure the handling of messages generated when users issue
Junos OS CLI commands, by specifying the interactive-commands facility at the following severity levels:
• info—Logs a message when users issue any command at the CLI operational or configuration mode
prompt. The example writes the messages to the file /var/log/user-actions.
• notice—Logs a message when users issue the configuration mode commands rollback and commit. The
example writes the messages to the terminal of user philip.
• warning—Logs a message when users issue a command that restarts a software process. The example
writes the messages to the console.
[edit system]
syslog {
file user-actions {
interactive-commands info;
}
user philip {
interactive-commands notice;
}
