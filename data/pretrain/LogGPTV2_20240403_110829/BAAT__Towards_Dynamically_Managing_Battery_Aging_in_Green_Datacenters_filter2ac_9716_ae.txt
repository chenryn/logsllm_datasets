machines  on  our  computing  server  nodes.  Each  power 
management scheme is run one day and we record the running 
logs on our control server node. The logs contains the workload 
power demands of the six computing server nodes, the one day 
solar power generation trace and aging metrics information (e.g., 
NAT, CF, PC, DDT, and DR) of six battery nodes. Note that, as 
the  solar  power  varies  every  day,  to  obtain  the  same  solar 
generation condition for comparing the four power management 
experiments, we run our experiments multiple days and record 
all  the  logs.  By  analyzing  the  solar  power  state  logs  (e.g.,  per 
day maximal, minimal, and average values, as well as the total 
energy),  we  are  able  to  find  the  most  similar  solar  generation 
scenarios  across  the  multi-groups  of  experiment  logs  and 
compare the results of four schemes. Figures 13-(a) and 13-(b) 
show the impact of the four power management algorithms on 
the  battery  aging  when  batteries  are  “young”.  Note  that  we 
select the worst battery node that has the most Ah-throughput in 
each power management policies. 
In  October,  when  batteries  became  “old”,  we  conduct  the 
experiments with same  methods and the results are showed  in 
Figures  13-(c)  and  13-(d).  Note  that,  during  April  to  October, 
we  regularly  use  the  batteries  and  make  them  gradually  and 
synchronously  aging  in  our  prototype.  Our  system  collects 
various log data during runtime.  
  By comparing the variation of the aging metrics of the four 
power  management  schemes,  we  can  conclude  the  following 
results. (1) Battery ages faster in the harsh usage conditions, for 
example,  the  Ah-throughput  of  e-Buff  algorithm  in  cloudy  is 
increased by 35% than the sunny day on average. (2) The “old” 
battery should demands more attentions to take care of the aging 
issue than the “young” battery. Especially for the e-Buff power 
management  scheme,  we  can  see  that  the  PC  value  of  “old” 
battery is reduced by 17% than the “young” battery on average, 
which  means  the  battery  node  stays  low  SoC  and  is  prone  to 
wear  out.  (3)  By  leveraging  our  BAAT  battery  aging  aware 
power management algorithm, the battery aging progresses can 
be effectively hidden and slowed down. 
The e-Buff power management scheme always aggressively 
uses  battery  to  bridge  the  gap  between  server  power  demands 
and solar power budget, which obviously accelerates the battery 
Ah throughput (1.3 X more than BAAT on average), especially 
when it is cloudy and the battery stays old aging states (2.1X). 
The BAAT-s power management scheme is aware of the aging 
issues and leverages power capping technique (DFVS) to slow 
down  the  battery  aging  progresses,  but  the  simplified  aging 
management  policy  only  perform  DVFS  operation  for  some 
computing  server  when  the  battery  power  cannot  afford  the 
mismatch of solar budget and server  power demands, which is a 
passive solution and leads to workload performance degradation 
(detailed in next section 6.3). The BAAT-h power management 
scheme  employs  VM  migration  mechanism  to  alleviate  one 
battery  node  aging  progress.  But  it  lacks  the  holistic  battery 
node  aging  information  (e.g.,  weighted  aging  metrics)  and  the

Our  BAAT  algorithm 
is  a  holistic  battery  aging-aware 
management  policy  which  calculates  and  ranks  the  weighted 
aging metrics of all battery nodes. It also refers the work-load 
power profiling information to manage battery aging. Based on 
these  techniques,  our  BAAT  can  dynamically  slow  down  and 
hide  the  battery  aging  effect  across  all  the  battery  nodes  in 
datacenters, which balances the aging effect and prevents severe 
aging of some battery nodes.  
  By  comparing  and  analyzing  their  aging  metrics  logs,  we 
can see that the BAAT can: (1) Effectively reduce the total Ah-

with  same  weighting  factors)  in  worse  case  condition  (cloudy 
and old battery), we conclude that the BAAT can reduce  battery 
aging speed in the worst case by 38%.  
C.  Lifetime Improvement 
the  worst  battery  node  which

the  aging 
Since  the  battery  cycling  frequency  is  greatly  affected  by 
renewable  energy  availability  and  load  power  demand,  we 
evaluate  battery  lifetime  improvements  under  different  solar 
energy potentials and server capacities (Figures 14 and 15).  
We  first  consider  geographic  locations  that  have  different 
solar energy availabilities (represented by sunshine fraction, the 
percentage of time when sunshine is recorded [41]). It is clear 
that  battery  lifetime  increases  when  the  availability  of  solar 
energy grows. This is primarily because batteries do not need to 
be frequently discharged when the solar power output is high. 
In fact, sometimes the  entire load can be directly powered by 
solar  panels  without  using  the  stored  green  energy.  BAAT 
could  extend  battery  life  by  69%  on  average,  compared  to  e-
Buff.  The  lifetime  improvement  for  BAAT-s  and  BAAT-h  is 
37%  and  29%,  respectively.  Our  results  show  that  aging 
slowdown has a larger impact on battery lifetime, compared to 
aging balancing. 
On  the  other  hand,  by  varying  the  loading  placed  on 
batteries  (represented  by  server-to-battery  capacity  ratio),  our 
results demonstrate three key findings: (1) A heavy server-to-
battery  ratio  accelerates  aging.  As  we  increase  the  server-to-
battery  capacity  ratio  from  2W/Ah  to  10W/Ah,  the  average 
battery lifetime decreases by 35% (Figure 15). This is mainly 
because  heavy  server  loading  is  more  likely  to  create  power 
spikes, which cause deep battery discharge and high discharge 
rate.  (2)  The  optimization  effectiveness  of  BAAT  on  battery 
lifetime  becomes  greater  when  the  server  system  is  heavily 
power-constrained.  Although  the  battery  life  decreases  when 
adding servers, we observe that the performance improvement 
of BAAT (compared to e-Buff) grows from 37% to 1.4X. This 
indicates  the  benefits  of  our  battery  management  actually 
increase when a green datacenter has to frequently use energy 
storage  systems  to  handle  power  shortfall.  (3)  Excessively 
increasing  battery  capacity  to  reduce  server-to-battery  ratio 
may  not  be  wise.  In  Figure  15,  doubling  the  installed  battery 
can cut the battery-to-server ratio by half, but may result in less 
than  30%  lifetime  improvement.  This  is  because  the  aging 
process  is  not  linearly  correlated  with  the  reduction  in  server 
loads. One should carefully plan the battery capacity. 
D.  Cost Benefits of BAAT 
Increasing  battery  lifetime  can  greatly  increase  the  return 
on  investment  (ROI)  due  to  the  reduced  battery  depreciation 
cost.  By  varying  the  threshold  in  our  aging  slowdown 
optimization  algorithm,  we  observe  that  the  cost  benefits 
changes. Increasing the threshold allow batteries to offload more 
burden,  thereby  increasing  their  lifetime  and  reducing  cost. 
Compared to e-Buff, BAAT can achieve 26% cost reduction, as

effectively reduces deep discharge 
Fig. 19. Distribution of battery SoC under 
different battery power management schemes 
shown in Figure 16. Note that aggressively applying the aging 
slowdown algorithm is not wise since it may cause unnecessary 
performance degradation. 
An  interesting  observation  is  that  BAAT  allows  existing 
green  datacenters  to  expand  (scale-out)  without  increasing  the 
total cost of ownership (TCO). This is because the cost savings 
due  to  improved  battery  life  can  actually  be  used  to  purchase 
more servers. Figure 17 evaluates the number of server that is 
allowed to be added to datacenter without increasing the TCO. 
The result is closely related with the sunshine fraction since the 
actual server that can be installed depends on the available solar 
power budget. In geographic locations that have abundant solar 
energy,  one  can  add  up  to  15%  more  servers.  Note  that  the 
server  expansion  ratio  does  not  linearly  grow  when  server 
number  increases.  The  main  reason  is  that  the  battery  lifetime 
decreases as server number grows, which adds depreciation cost.  
E.  Datacenter Availability 
This  section  focuses  on  the  availability  of  server  system 
from  the  perspective  of  battery  aging  management.  The  key 
aging  factor  that  directly  correlates  with  server  availability  is 
deep  discharge  time  (DDT).  Prior  work  has  shown  that 
datacenter  must  leave  2  minutes  of  reserve  capacity  in  UPS 
battery  for  high  availability  [42].  A  low  SoC  means  less 
reserved energy, which is dangerous when green servers plan to 
draw large amount of power from the battery.  
  We  monitor  and  collect  the  low-SoC  duration  of  different 
power  management  schemes  from  the  experiment  logs,  as 
shown  in  Figure  18.  As  can  be  seen,  the  e-Buff  scheme  can 
easily make some batteries enter low-SoC state for a long time. 
It potentially increases the chance of power budget violation and 
causes single point of failure (SPOF) when a battery happens to 
run  out  of  power  upon  load  power  spikes.  In  contrast,  BAAT 
can dynamically slow down and balance the SoC across all the 
battery  nodes,  which  can  effectively  eliminate  SPOF.  Our 
results  show  that  BAAT  could  increase  battery  availability  by 
47% based on the statistics of  low-SoC duration of the worst-
case battery node. 
In  Figure  19  we  further  evaluate  the  distribution  of  deep 
discharging over 6 months. It is clear that e-Buff tends to create 
low-SoC batteries, whereas BAAT can shift the most likely SoC 
region  towards  90%-100%.  Therefore,  BAAT  increases  the 
resiliency and emergency handling capability. 
F.  Workload Performance 
This section presents the impact of different battery power 
management 
schemes  on  workload  performance.  The 
experimental  method  is  the  same  as  Section  6.B.  We  evaluate 
the  total  compute  throughput  of  the  four  power  management 
schemes in one day, as shown in Figure 20. 
316316
Intuitively, 
the  e-Buff  algorithm  can  yield 
the  best 
performance as it ignores battery aging  issue and  aggressively 
uses  battery  to  satisfy  workload  performance.  However,  when 
the  solar  budget  is  inadequate  and  the  capacity  of  battery 
reduces  to  the  cut-off  level,  the  server  has  to  be  shut  down. 
During server downtime, the throughput is zero for e-Buff. The 
BAAT-s  power  management  policy  always  leverage  power 
capping  mechanisms  to  alleviate  the  battery  aging  and  avoid 
aggressive  battery  usage.  However,  it  reduces  the  CPU 
computing speed and leads to workload throughput degradation. 
The purpose of workload migration in BAAT-h algorithm is to 
avoid battery aging acceleration. However, as mentioned earlier, 
BAAT-h  lacks  the  holistic  information  of  battery  aging  and 
power demands and its low-efficiency migration causes severe 
performance  overhead  (e.g.,  frequent  VM  stop  and  restart). 
Based on the profiling information and the calculated weighted 
aging metrics of all the battery nodes, our BAAT algorithm can 
dynamically  slow  down  battery  aging  and  schedule  workloads 
according.  Compared  to  e-Buff  in  the  worst  case  (cloudy  and 
old battery), BAAT can improve the performance by 28%.
