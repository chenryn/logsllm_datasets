There is an asymmetry to EnterLeave event plugin. Since `mouseenter` is
created from the relativeTarget of the `mouseout` event it fires even though
the target is disabled. Since the `mouseleave` is the inverse, i.e requires
that the disabled element fire a mouseout, it doesn't fire a `mouseleave` for
the disabled element.
I am pretty sure the correct behavior here is that neither event should fire
if its target is disabled, since this mirrors `mouseout`. No idea if none-
chrome browsers have the same behavior for which mouse events fire on disabled
elements.
Additional caveat I just realized, React is probably also not firing
`mousenter` events in the case where the mouse leaves a disabled element into
a non disabled element
