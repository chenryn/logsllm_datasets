User: How to connect to remote host through SSH protocol? Please provide steps and examples.
Assistant: The steps to connect to the remote host are as follows: 1. Open the terminal and enter the following command: ``` ssh username@remote_host ``` Among them, `username` is the username of the remote host, and `remote_host` is the IP address or domain name of the remote host. 2. If it is the first time to connect to the remote host, a prompt will appear: ``` The authentication of host 'remote_host (IP address)' can't be established. RSA key fingerprint is xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx :xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx. Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? ``` Type `yes` and press Enter to confirm. 3. Next, you need to enter the password of the remote host, and then press the Enter key to log in. 4. If the login is successful, you can interact with the remote host on the terminal. Example: Suppose the IP address of the remote host is 10.0.0.1, and the user name is linuxuser. The command to connect to the remote host is as follows: ``` ssh linuxuser@10.0.0.1 ``` Then enter the password and press the Enter key to log in to the remote host.
