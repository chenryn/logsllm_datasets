  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate. I believe the only relevant thing is this comment #8100 (comment): 
> we would love to know if you can bundle the v1-beta branch with rollup.
## Expected Behavior
Bundling with Rollup should work as long as MUI provides ES modules
(https://github.com/rollup/rollup/wiki/ES6-modules#es6-friendly-libraries).
## Current Behavior
Currently, there is an `index.es.js` file which is an ES module itself, but it
points at CommonJS modules (https://unpkg.com/material-
PI:EMAIL/index.es.js). This then causes Rollup to fail to build:
    [!] Error: 'BottomNavigationAction' is not exported by node_modules/material-ui/BottomNavigation/index.js
    https://github.com/rollup/rollup/wiki/Troubleshooting#name-is-not-exported-by-module
    node_modules/material-ui/index.es.js (9:38)
     7: export { default as Avatar } from './Avatar';
     8: export { default as Badge } from './Badge';
     9: export { default as BottomNavigation, BottomNavigationAction } from './BottomNavigation';
                                              ^
    10: export { default as Button } from './Button';
    11: export { default as ButtonBase } from './ButtonBase';
Presumably, this is because https://github.com/rollup/rollup-plugin-commonjs
cannot fully understand the CommonJS exports (unless you manually specify them
via `namedExports` option).
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
I have a simple repro available here: https://github.com/NMinhNguyen/material-
ui-rollup-example
It also contains a branch where I modified `yarn.lock` to point at a temporary
fork of MUI that publishes ES modules (source), and bundling with Rollup works
without any other changes. I am willing to raise a PR with this change (I'll
probably also replace the current `build:es2015modules` script as I believe my
change supersedes it, but not sure if removing `index.es.js` could be
considered a breaking change?), but I thought I'd raise an issue first (this
is also what the contributing guide suggests) ðŸ™‚
I have also created this branch where I committed the current build output and
how it changes with my changes so you can more easily review them as well as
spot any possible regressions. And here you can find the actual ES5 modules.
By the way, the reason I would rather not use the `es` folder is because that
folder is ESNext (2015+), so I'd have to transpile it via Babel myself. This
would mean that I'd additionally have to include these plugins to ensure I get
the same Babel transformations applied: https://github.com/mui-org/material-
ui/blob/8497cd976d74cfd102c6e8afb932348b366dd5b3/.babelrc#L70-L83
