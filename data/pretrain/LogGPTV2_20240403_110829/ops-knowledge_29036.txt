User: Please explain what a port number is and what it does.
Assistant: A port number is a number used to identify a network application. In the TCP/IP protocol, each network application has a unique port number, which is used to distinguish different applications and data exchange. In network communication, data packets are transmitted through IP addresses and port numbers. Port numbers can be divided into two categories: system port numbers and dynamic port numbers. System port numbers are some port numbers fixedly assigned to network protocols and services, usually ranging from 0 to 1023. The dynamic port number is a port number dynamically assigned by the application program at runtime, and usually ranges from 1024 to 65535. The role of the port number is that it provides a way for network applications to identify and access network services. Through the port number, the network application program can easily connect to the specific application program on the server and send data to it to realize the communication between the client and the server. At the same time, the port number can also be used to restrict network traffic on a specific port, thereby enhancing network security.
