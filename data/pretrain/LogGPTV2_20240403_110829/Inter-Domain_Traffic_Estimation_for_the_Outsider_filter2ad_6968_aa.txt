## Abstract

Characterizing the flow of Internet traffic is crucial in various contexts, including network engineering, application design, and understanding the impact of consumer demand and business relationships on the network. Despite growing interest, the nearly impossible task of collecting large-scale, Internet-wide traffic data has severely limited the scope of traffic-related studies.

In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to characterize inter-domain traffic by reusing large, publicly available traceroute datasets. Our approach leverages the insight that the popularity of a route on the Internet can serve as an informative proxy for the volume of traffic it carries. We apply structural analysis to a dual-representation of the AS-level connectivity graph derived from traceroute datasets. Drawing analogies with city grids and traffic, we adapt data transformations and metrics of route popularity from urban planning to serve as proxies for traffic volume. This approach, which we call Network Syntax, highlights the connection to urban planning's Space Syntax. We apply Network Syntax in the context of a global ISP and a large Internet Exchange Point (IXP) and use ground-truth data to demonstrate strong correlations (r² values up to 0.9) between inter-domain traffic volume and the different proxy metrics. We show the potential of Network Syntax for identifying critical links and inferring missing traffic matrix measurements.

## 1. Introduction

Studies on the Internet inter-domain system have primarily focused on network connectivity and dynamics, ranging from measuring and generating AS-level graphs to examining the properties of topology snapshots. However, there is a growing consensus on the need to shift focus towards understanding Internet traffic.

Knowledge of inter-domain traffic characteristics is essential in various contexts, such as capacity planning, anomaly detection, and performance analysis. The major impediment to Internet traffic research has been the scarcity of publicly available traffic data. Researchers often have to choose between fine-grained data on a small slice of the network or publicly available, but coarse-grained and sparse datasets. While detailed studies of important network entities like IXPs and Content Providers can improve our understanding of inter-domain traffic, enlisting the cooperation of ISPs, Content Providers, or IXPs requires personal connections and is thus hard to replicate or scale. On the other hand, analyzing individual networks with available traffic data limits researchers to a few entities.

In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to characterize inter-domain traffic by reusing many publicly available traceroute datasets. Our key observation is that the popularity of a route on the Internet can serve as an informative proxy for the volume of traffic it carries. Traceroute measurements allow us to trace the paths taken by packets, and the routes identified by a large number of traceroutes can be used to infer the popularity of a path.

Building on this observation, we introduce a new abstraction of AS-level paths and apply structural analysis to a dual-representation of the AS-level connectivity graph derived from traceroute datasets. Drawing analogies with city grids and traffic, we adapt metrics of route popularity from urban planning to serve as proxies for network traffic. We call this approach Network Syntax, highlighting the connection to Space Syntax, an urban-planning graph-based approach to study human and vehicular flows by leveraging the strong correlation between traffic and the morphological property of streets. Network Syntax builds on known abstractions and techniques from graph theory, adapting them to our problem domain to derive new insights on inter-domain traffic from traceroute data.

We leverage publicly available traceroute datasets and apply Network Syntax in the context of a global ISP and a large IXP. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to highlight and capitalize on the strong correlation between Internet route popularity and the volume of traffic it carries, showing how this popularity can be derived from easy-to-perform traceroute campaigns and available datasets.

In this context, we present:
- An approach, Network Syntax, that leverages traceroute datasets to tackle a problem that can currently only be studied by a few researchers with access to proprietary data.
- A demonstration of the strong correlations between inter-domain traffic volumes and the different Network Syntax metrics applied to traceroute-based AS-level connectivity graphs (and, in contrast, the weak correlations that result from applying them to BGP-derived connectivity graphs).
- An analysis of the robustness of Network Syntax to inherent idiosyncrasies of the underlying traceroute data (e.g., IP alias resolution problem and inability to trace through layer 2 clouds) and the particulars of the measurement platform used (e.g., number and network location of the vantage points).
- An illustration of the potential of Network Syntax with two use cases: the prediction of missing traffic link volumes in a connectivity graph and the ranking of AS-links based on traffic volume.

For validation, we rely on traffic ground-truth data from an ISP and an IXP. The fact that, as in most Internet studies, we cannot reveal the sources or share this data, further motivates our approach.

## 2. Background

There is a substantial body of work focused on generating, modeling, and analyzing the inter-domain topology. These include efforts that examine graph properties of the AS topology as a logical construct, techniques to measure and infer AS-level connectivity, approaches to model and characterize the Internet topology, or concentrate on the IXP substrate and its topological importance. Other efforts have used traceroute measurements to augment intra-domain router-level ISP maps by deriving OSPF link weights consistent with routing.

Beyond topology, inter-domain traffic has been an active research topic due to its importance in a wide range of contexts, from network engineering to application design. However, while some research projects have made selected network traffic traces available to vetted researchers, the nearly impossible task of collecting large-scale, Internet-wide traffic data has seriously restricted the focus of traffic-related studies. Previous efforts have investigated traffic estimation and characterization but have had to rely on close collaboration with ISPs, content providers, or IXPs to gain access to the necessary traffic data or be limited by the coarse-grained nature of publicly available datasets.

Some related efforts have explored techniques and methodologies for inferring traffic matrix elements that are either not directly measurable or missing. What distinguishes our approach from these methods is their reliance, in one way or another, on link measurements obtained from either proprietary data or publicly available traffic measurements.

## 3. Network Syntax

In this section, we expand on our descriptions of Network Syntax, its methodology, and metrics. Network Syntax applies structural analysis to a dual-representation of the AS-level connectivity graph, derived from publicly available traceroute datasets, and uses different metrics to capture the popularity of a network path as a proxy for the volume of traffic it carries.

Drawing analogies with city grids and traffic, our approach adapts metrics of route popularity from urban planning's Space Syntax for the analysis of inter-domain traffic. The following paragraphs provide a short overview of Space Syntax. For a more in-depth description, we refer the reader to Hillier et al. [26].

### 3.1 Space Syntax Overview

Space Syntax is a configurational analysis methodology introduced in 1984 for predicting pedestrian movement in urban settings based on an analysis of the urban grid. The key observation behind Space Syntax is that the configuration of space is the driving force behind how cities operate. Over the years, this observation has been leveraged to draw correlations between topological accessibility of spaces and urban features, from pedestrian and vehicular flows to land use and the geographic distribution of various types of crime.

In Space Syntax, cities are represented as "axial maps" and then transformed into graphs. Axial maps of cities are obtained by drawing the smallest number of straight lines (called axial lines) that pass through all open spaces. These maps are then transformed into graphs by representing the axial lines as nodes and interconnecting the nodes that intersect in the map. This dual representation of the graph, where nodes are streets and edges are intersections, focuses on the connectivity of the streets irrespective of their width, length, and location, and enables the identification of concrete metrics for each street. The centrality of a street or space in this graph is an indication of its importance in the city operation. Figure 1 shows an example of such a transformation.

Space Syntax introduces four core syntactic metrics, three of which can be mapped to equivalent graph-theory metrics but described using its own terminology:
1. **Connectivity** (degree centrality in graph theory) assesses the ranking of nodes within a connectivity graph, equaling the number of directly linked or neighboring nodes.
2. **Control value** measures the degree to which space controls access to its immediate neighbors by taking into account the number of alternative connections that each of these neighbors has. It is calculated by summing the reciprocals of connectivities between neighbors. This metric can be linked to clustering coefficient in graph analysis.
3. **Global choice** (betweenness centrality in graph theory) captures how often each line is used on topologically shortest paths from all lines to all other lines in the system.
4. **Integration** (a type of normalized closeness centrality metric in graph analysis) measures the mean distance between every segment and all other segments in the system. The more integrated segments are those that are closest on average to all other segments, while the more segregated segments are those that are furthest on average from all other segments. Many empirical studies have shown that the integration metric is accurate in determining which segments are favored by the configuration.

### 3.2 Network Syntax

We argue that the construction of AS-level connectivity graphs, as carved out by probes of large traceroute campaigns, contains valuable information that can be leveraged through structural analysis. Our approach, Network Syntax, adapts the metrics and methodologies of Space Syntax to the context of inter-domain traffic. By applying these metrics to the dual-representation of the AS-level connectivity graph, we can infer the popularity of network paths and use this as a proxy for traffic volume.
