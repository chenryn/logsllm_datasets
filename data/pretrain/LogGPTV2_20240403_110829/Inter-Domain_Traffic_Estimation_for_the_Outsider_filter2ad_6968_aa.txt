ABSTRACT
Characterizing the ﬂow of Internet traﬃc is important in
a wide range of contexts, from network engineering and
application design to understanding the network impact
of consumer demand and business relationships. Despite
the growing interest, the nearly impossible task of col-
lecting large-scale, Internet-wide traﬃc data has severely
constrained the focus of traﬃc-related studies.
In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to character-
ize inter-domain traﬃc by reusing large, publicly available
traceroute datasets. Our approach builds on a simple insight
– the popularity of a route on the Internet can serve as an
informative proxy for the volume of traﬃc it carries. It ap-
plies structural analysis to a dual-representation of the AS-
level connectivity graph derived from available traceroute
datasets. Drawing analogies with city grids and traﬃc, it
adapts data transformations and metrics of route popularity
from urban planning to serve as proxies for traﬃc volume.
We call this approach Network Syntax, highlighting the
connection to urban planning Space Syntax. We apply
Network Syntax in the context of a global ISP and a
large Internet eXchange Point and use ground-truth data
to demonstrate the strong correlation (r2 values of up to
0.9) between inter-domain traﬃc volume and the diﬀerent
proxy metrics. Working with these two network entities, we
show the potential of Network Syntax for identifying critical
links and inferring missing traﬃc matrix measurements.

INTRODUCTION
Studies on the Internet inter-domain system have focused
on network connectivity and dynamics and have ranged
from exploring techniques to measure and generate AS-level
graphs [10, 17, 48] to examining the properties of topology
snapshots [23, 40]. There is, however, a growing consensus
on the need to shift focus beyond connectivity towards
understanding Internet traﬃc.
Knowledge of inter-domain traﬃc characteristics is im-
portant in a number of diﬀerent contexts, from capacity
planning to anomaly detection, and performance analysis.
The major impediment to Internet traﬃc research has been
the scarcity of publicly available traﬃc data. Researchers
have typically had to choose between ﬁne-grained data on a
small slice of the network [7,11,14,33], or publicly available,
but coarse-grained and sparse datasets [13]. While detailed
studies of
important network entities such as Internet
eXchange Points (IXPs) [7] and Content Providers [6] can
improve our understanding of the inter-domain traﬃc, en-
listing the cooperation of Internet Service Providers (ISPs),
Content Providers or IXPs requires personal connections
and are thus hard to replicate or scale. On the other
hand, analysis of individual networks for which traﬃc data
is available, seriously limits researchers to a handful entities.
In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to char-
acterize inter-domain traﬃc by reusing the many publicly
available traceroute datasets. Our key observation is that
the popularity of a route on the Internet can serve as an
informative proxy for the volume of traﬃc it carries. While
traceroute measurements allow us to draw the paths taken
by packets when traversing the Internet, the routes identiﬁed
by a large number of traceroutes can be used to infer the
popularity of a path.
Building on this observation, we introduce a new abstrac-
tion of AS-level path and apply structural analysis to a dual-
representation of the AS-level connectivity graph, derived
from traceroute datasets. Drawing analogies with city grids
and traﬃc, we adapt metrics of route popularity from urban
planning to serve as proxies for network traﬃc. We call
this approach Network Syntax, highlighting the connection
to Space Syntax [26, 41], an urban-planning graph-based
approach to study human and vehicular ﬂows by leveraging
the strong correlation between traﬃc and the morphological
property of streets. Network Syntax (as the related Space
Syntax) builds on known abstractions and techniques from
1graph theory, and adapts them to our problem domain to
derive new insights on inter-domain traﬃc from traceroute
data.
We leverage publicly available traceroute datasets and
apply Network Syntax in the context of a global ISP and
a large Internet eXchange Point (IXP).1 To the best of our
knowledge, our work is the ﬁrst to point out and capitalize
on the strong correlation between Internet route popularity
and the volume of traﬃc it carries, showing how this
popularity can be derived from easy-to-perform traceroute
campaigns and available datasets.
In this context, we
present:
• An approach, Network Syntax, that leverages tracer-
oute datasets to tackle a problem that can currently
only be studied by a few researchers with access to
proprietary data.
• A demonstration of the strong correlations between
inter-domain traﬃc volumes and the diﬀerent Network
Syntax metrics applied to traceroute-based AS-level
connectivity graphs (and, in contrast, the weak corre-
lations that result from applying them to BGP-derived
connectivity graphs).
• An analysis of the robustness of Network Syntax to
inherent idiosyncrasies of the underlying traceroute
data (e.g., IP alias resolution problem and inability
to trace through layer 2 clouds) and the particulars
of the measurement platform used (e.g., number and
network location of the vantage points).
• An illustration of the potential of Network Syntax with
two use cases – the prediction of missing traﬃc link
volumes in a connectivity graph, and the ranking of
AS-links based on traﬃc volume.
For validation we rely on traﬃc ground-truth data from an
ISP and an IXP; the fact that, as in most Internet studies,
we cannot reveal the sources or share this data, further
motivates our approach.
2. BACKGROUND
There is a large body of work focused on generating,
modeling and analyzing the inter-domain topology. These
include eﬀorts that examine graph properties of the AS
topology as a logical construct [19, 23, 40], techniques to
measure and infer AS-level connectivity [10, 17, 48], ap-
proaches to model and characterize the Internet topol-
ogy [40], or concentrate on the IXP substrate and its
topological
importance [8, 48]. Other eﬀorts have used
traceroute measurements to augment intra-domain router-
level ISP maps by deriving OSPF link weights that are
consistent with routing [35].
Beyond topology, inter-domain traﬃc has been an active
research topic given its importance in a wide range of
contexts, from network engineering to application design.
However, while some research projects have made selected
network traﬃc traces available to vetted researchers [45],
the nearly impossible task of collecting large-scale, Internet-
wide traﬃc data has seriously restricted the focus of traﬃc-
related studies. Previous eﬀorts have thus investigated
traﬃc estimation and characterization (e.g., [6,22,38,42,46]),
but have to rely on close collaboration with ISPs, content

providers or IXPs [16, 20–22, 33] to gain access to the
necessary traﬃc data or be limited by the coarse-grained
nature of publicly available datasets [13].
Some related eﬀorts have explored techniques and method-
ologies for inferring traﬃc matrix elements that are either
not directly measurable [11,24] or missing [38,50–52]. What
distinguishes our approach from these methods is their
reliance,
in one way or another, on link measurements
obtained from either proprietary data or publicly available
traﬃc measurements.2
3. NETWORK SYNTAX
In this section we expand on our descriptions of Network
Syntax,
its methodology and metrics. Network Syntax
applies structural analysis to a dual-representation of the
AS-level connectivity graph, derived from publicly available
traceroute datasets, and uses diﬀerent metrics to capture
the popularity of a network path as a proxy for the volume
of traﬃc it carries.
Drawing analogies with city grids and traﬃc, our approach
adapts metrics of route popularity from urban planning’s
Space Syntax [26,41] for the analysis of inter-domain traﬃc.
The following paragraphs presents a short overview of Space
Syntax. We refer the reader to Hillier et al. [26] for a more
in-depth description.
3.1 Space Syntax Overview
Space Syntax is a conﬁgurational analysis methodology
ﬁrst introduced in 1984 [25] for predicting pedestrian move-
ment in urban settings based on an analysis of the urban
grid. The key observation behind Space Syntax is that the
conﬁguration of space is the driving force behind how cities
operate. Over the years, this observation has been leveraged
to draw correlations between topological accessibility of
spaces and urban features:
from pedestrian and vehicular
ﬂows to land use, and the geographic distribution of various
types of crime [27].
In Space Syntax, cities are represented as “axial maps”
and then transformed into graphs. Axial maps of cities are
obtained by drawing the smallest number of straight lines
(called axial lines) that pass through all open spaces. These
maps are then transformed into graphs by representing the
axial
lines as nodes and interconnecting the nodes that
intersect in the map. This dual representation of the
graph, where nodes are streets and edges are intersections,
focuses on the connectivity of the streets irrespective of their
width, length and location, and enables the identiﬁcation of
concrete metrics for each street. The centrality of a street
or space in this graph is an indication of its importance in
the city operation. Figure 1 shows an example of such a
transformation.
Space Syntax introduces four core syntactic metrics,
three of which can be mapped to an equivalent graph-
theory metric but described using its own terminology. (1)
Connectivity – also known as degree centrality in graph
theory – is the simplest metric for assessing ranking of
nodes within a connectivity graph, it equals the number
of directly linked or neighboring nodes. A closely related
metric (2) Control value measures the degree to which space
controls access to its immediate neighbors by taking into
account the number of alternative connections that each of

these neighbors has [31]. It is calculated by summing the
reciprocals of connectivities between neighbors. This metric
can be linked to clustering coeﬃcient in graph analysis.
(3) Global choice – also known as betweenness centrality
in graph theory – captures how often each line is used
on topologically shortest paths from all lines to all other
lines in the system. Finally, (4) Integration – a type of
normalized closeness centrality metric in graph analysis –
measures the mean distance between every segment and all
other segments in the system [32]. The more integrated
segments are those that are closest on average to all other
segments, while the more segregated segments are those
that are furthest on average from all other segments. Many
empirical studies have shown that the integration metric is
accurate in determining which segments are favored by the
conﬁguration [26, 32].
3.2 Network Syntax
We argue that the construction of AS-level connectivity
graphs as carved out by probes of large traceroute campaigns
contain valuable information that can be leveraged through
