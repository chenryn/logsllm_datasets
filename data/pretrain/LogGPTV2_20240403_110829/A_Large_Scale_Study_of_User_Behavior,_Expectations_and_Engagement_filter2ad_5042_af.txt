A.2 Expectation Survey at App Install Time
We ask users right after they install an app about which per-
missions they expect the app will ask for. Participants can
choose as many as they like.
A.2.1 Which of the following permission do you think
the app requires?
• Camera
• Contacts
• Location
• Microphone
• Phone
• Storage
• Body Sensors
• Calendar
• SMS
• Call Logs
• Physical Activity
• None
• I don’t know
A.3 Permission Grant Event Survey
We randomized the order of the possible options except for
the "None" and "Other", which were always placed at the end.
A.3.1 Why did you grant the permission request?
• I want to use a feature that needs this permission
• I trust the developer
• I think the app won’t work otherwise
• I have nothing to hide
• The developer already has this information about me
• I want the permission screen to go away
• Because the app is popular
• The app gave an explanation that made sense
• None
• Other
The following question is used to gauge permission expec-
tations at runtime.
A.3.2 Did you expect the app requests this permission?
• Yes
• No
A.3.4 Do you want to grant the permission temporar-
ily?
• Yes
• No
A.4 Permission Denial Event Survey
We randomized the order of the possible options except for
the "None" and "Other", which were always placed at the end.
A.4.1 Why did you deny the permission request?
• I think the app shouldn’t need this permission
• I can always grant it afterwards if I change my mind
• I do not use the speciﬁc feature associated with the per-
mission
• I consider the permission to be very sensitive
• I don’t trust the developer
• I wanted the permission screen to go away
• The app gave a poor explanation
• I think something bad might happen
• None
• Other
A.4.2 Did you expect the app requests this permission?
• Yes
• No
A.5 Exit Survey
Users were asked to state how much the agree or disagree with
each statement in this survey using the following 5 options:
• Strongly Agree
• Agree
• Neither Agree Nor Disagree
• Disagree
• Strongly Disagree
Note that question 4 in the Control section (A.5.1) is the op-
posite of the statement in question 4 of the Collection Section
(A.5.3). This was inserted as an attention checking question.
Surveys with contradictory answers were not used.

A.5.1 Control Section Questions
1. Mobile app privacy is about a user’s right to exercise
control over decisions about how their information is
collected, used, and shared.
2. User control of personal information is essential to mo-
bile app privacy.
3. I believe that mobile app privacy is compromised when
the user loses control over their information as a result
of app usage.
4. I’m not concerned that smartphone apps are collecting
too much personal information about me 5.
A.5.2 Awareness of Privacy Practices Section Questions
1. Mobile app developers seeking information should dis-
close the way the data are collected, processed, and used.
2. A good mobile app privacy policy should have a clear
and conspicuous disclosure.
3. It is very important to me that I am aware and knowl-
edgeable about how my personal information will be
used.
A.5.3 Collection Section Questions
1. It usually bothers me when smartphone apps ask me for
personal information.
2. When mobile apps ask me for personal information, I
sometimes think twice before providing it.
3. It bothers me to give personal information to so many
mobile apps.
4. I’m concerned that smartphone apps are collecting too
much personal information about me.
A.5.4 Secondary Use Section Questions
1. Mobile apps should not use personal information for any
purpose unless it has been authorized by the individuals
who provided information.
2. When people give personal information to a mobile app
for some reason, the app developer should never use the
information for any other reason.
3. Mobile app developers should never sell the personal
information in their computer databases to other compa-
nies.
4. Mobile app developers should never share personal in-
formation with other companies unless it has been autho-
rized by the individual who provided the information.

up to Android 10. The data is stored off device in a Firebase
cloud datastore. When one of the app install or permission
decision events happen, PrivaDroid will detect it and create
a notiﬁcation that can direct the users to the corresponding
survey. App install events are detected by listening to the
ACTION_PACKAGE_ADDED Android system broadcast intents.
For devices running Android 8.0 or higher, we additionally
implemented a foreground service to listen to these broadcast
events. Package name, app name and the app version name
are logged by probing the Android Package Installer.
Capturing permission events is a bit more challeng-
ing as no system intent is broadcast when a permis-
sion request is granted or denied. A seemingly obvious
way to observe permission changes is to consistently poll
the permissions granted for an app using the Android
getInstalledPackages API and check if anything changes.
However, this approach can only capture permission changes
but not the permission decisions that do not result in any
change. For example, denying a request for a permission that
was already denied before will not be caught. Instead, Pri-
vaDroid uses the accessibility service facility to monitor the
screen that participants view and looks for UI elements with
speciﬁc strings or View IDs to detect permission prompts, and
uses the app usage permission to detect which app package
requested the permission. Based on the information, it then
extracts the app name, permission name and the participant’s
grant/deny decisions.
We only use data of participants who have the application
continually installed for the length of the study. However,
participants may leave the study anytime they wish and they
do not need to explicitly inform us when they leave. To detect
if a participant has left the study, PrivaDroid implements a
heartbeat message that will be sent to its Firebase datastore
daily. The heartbeat message contains two booleans, which
are whether the accessibility service and app usage access
are enabled for PrivaDroid. These two booleans were used
to determine if a user’s data is valid and should be included
in our analysis. Additionally, if PrivaDroid detects that either
the accessibility service or app usage permission has been
revoked, but the PrivaDroid app has not been uninstalled,
the PrivaDroid app will create a notiﬁcation prompting the
participant to re-enable those capabilities in case they were
disabled by accident.
