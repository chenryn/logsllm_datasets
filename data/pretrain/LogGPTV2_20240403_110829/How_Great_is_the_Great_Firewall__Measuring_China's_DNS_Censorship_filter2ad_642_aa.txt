Abstract
The DNS ﬁltering apparatus of China’s Great Firewall
(GFW) has evolved considerably over the past two decades.
However, most prior studies of China’s DNS ﬁltering were per-
formed over short time periods, leading to unnoticed changes
in the GFW’s behavior. In this study, we introduce GFWatch,
a large-scale, longitudinal measurement platform capable of
testing hundreds of millions of domains daily, enabling con-
tinuous monitoring of the GFW’s DNS ﬁltering behavior.
We present the results of running GFWatch over a nine-
month period, during which we tested an average of 411M
domains per day and detected a total of 311K domains cen-
sored by GFW’s DNS ﬁlter. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the largest number of domains tested and censored domains
discovered in the literature. We further reverse engineer reg-
ular expressions used by the GFW and ﬁnd 41K innocuous
domains that match these ﬁlters, resulting in overblocking
of their content. We also observe bogus IPv6 and globally
routable IPv4 addresses injected by the GFW, including ad-
dresses owned by US companies, such as Facebook, Dropbox,
and Twitter.
Using data from GFWatch, we studied the impact of GFW
blocking on the global DNS system. We found 77K censored
domains with DNS resource records polluted in popular pub-
lic DNS resolvers, such as Google and Cloudﬂare. Finally, we
propose strategies to detect poisoned responses that can (1)
sanitize poisoned DNS records from the cache of public DNS
resolvers, and (2) assist in the development of circumvention
tools to bypass the GFW’s DNS censorship.
1 Introduction
Among the censorship regimes on the Internet, China is one
of the most notorious, having developed an advanced ﬁltering
system, known as the Great Firewall (GFW), to control the
ﬂow of online information. The GFW’s worldwide reputa-
tion [49] and ability to be measured from outside the country,
has drawn the attention of researchers from various disci-
plines, ranging from political science [24, 31, 38, 39] to in-
formation and computer science [21, 22, 41, 44, 68, 92].
Unlike many other DNS censorship approaches, the GFW
is known to return globally routable IP addresses in its in-
jected responses. Recent studies [21, 57, 59] have observed
injected IP addresses belonging to popular US companies, in-
cluding Facebook, Dropbox, and Twitter. The use of routable
IPs is in contrast to countries such as Bahrain, Korea, Kuwait,
Iran, Oman, Qatar, Thailand, or Yemen [51, 57, 65, 71, 79],
where DNS censorship redirects users to blockpages that
inform users about the blocked content. It is also in con-
trast to censors using ﬁxed DNS responses such as NXDO-
MAIN [26, 70, 71, 74] or addresses from private IP ranges
(e.g., 10.0.0.0/8) [19, 23, 74]. This use of globally routable IPs
by the GFW has implications for censorship detection, which
needs to carefully distinguish censored from legitimate DNS
responses, and also makes detecting and mitigating leaked
DNS responses from public resolvers non-trivial.
Despite the many previous studies that examine the techni-
cal strategies employed by the GFW, such as TCP/IP packet ﬁl-
tering [33, 41, 45, 73, 92] and DNS poisoning [22, 40, 46, 87],
there has yet to be a large-scale, longitudinal examination
of China’s DNS ﬁltering mechanism. This lack of visibil-
ity is apparent as the number of censored domains and the
pool of IP addresses used by the GFW in forged DNS re-
sponses have been reported differently by previous stud-
ies [21, 22, 27, 46, 67, 74, 87, 95]. In particular, the number
of fake IPs observed in poisoned responses has been increas-
ing from nine in 2010 [27], 28 in 2011 [87], 174 in 2014 [22],
to more than 1.5K recently [21]. To that end, it is necessary
to have a system for continuous, long-term monitoring of
the GFW’s ﬁltering policy that will provide timely insights
about its blocking behavior and assist censorship detection
and circumvention efforts.
In this work, we developed GFWatch (§3), a large-scale,
longitudinal measurement platform to shed light on DNS
ﬁltering by the GFW and assess its impact on the global
Internet. By building GFWatch, our primary goal is not only
to answer the questions of (1) how many censored domains

are there and (2) what are the forged IP addresses used in fake
DNS responses, but also to assess (3) the impact of the GFW’s
DNS censorship policy on the global Internet, and ultimately
design (4) strategies to effectively detect and circumvent the
GFW’s DNS censorship.
Using GFWatch, we tested a total of 534M distinct do-
mains (averaging 411M domains per day) and detected a total
of 311K censored domains (§4). We then used the set of cen-
sored domains to design a probing method that is able to
reverse-engineer the actual blocklist used by the GFW’s DNS
ﬁlter (§4.1). Using this list, we observed that 270K out of the
311K censored domains are censored as intended, whereas
the remaining 41K domains appear to be innocuous despite
matching regular expressions used by the GFW. Through our
measurements, we discovered 1,781 IPv4 and 1,799 IPv6
addresses used by the GFW in forged DNS responses (§5).
To the best of our knowledge, these are the largest sets of
censored domains and forged IP addresses ever discovered.
We also found evidence of geographic restrictions on Chi-
nese domains, with the GFW injecting DNS replies for do-
mains based in China (e.g., www.beian.gov.cn) (§6). While
previous studies attribute leakage of Chinese DNS censor-
ship to cases where a DNS resolver’s network path transits
through China’s network [27, 87], we found that geoblocking
and cases where censored domains have at least one authorita-
tive name server located in China are also a signiﬁcant cause
of pollution of external DNS resolvers (§6.1).
Based on the observed censored domains (§4) and forged
IP addresses (§5), we propose strategies to effectively detect
poisoned DNS responses injected by the GFW (§6.2). These
techniques will not only help public DNS resolvers and other
DNS-related services to sanitize tainted records (§6.2), but
can also assist future development of circumvention tools to
bypass the GFW’s DNS censorship (§7).
2 Background
The Internet ﬁltering infrastructure of China, allegedly de-
signed in the late 90s under the Golden Shield project [85, 94],
is a system used by the Chinese government to regulate
the country’s domestic Internet access. The ﬁltering system,
commonly referred to as the Great Firewall [52], consists
of middleboxes distributed across border autonomous sys-
tems [22, 35, 93], which are controlled in a centralized fash-
ion [38, 52, 85, 95]. There are several ﬁltering modules de-
veloped to control the free ﬂow of information at different
layers of the network stack, including TCP/IP packet ﬁlter-
ing [33, 41, 44, 72, 73, 92] and application-level keyword-
based blocking [33, 52, 80, 95]. However, we focus our dis-
cussion on the DNS poisoning aspect of the GFW which is
relevant to our study.
Unencrypted and unauthenticated DNS trafﬁc is widely
targeted by censorship systems to interrupt communications
between users and remote destinations where censored con-
tent or services are hosted [40, 71, 74, 84, 87]. Exploiting
DNS insecurity, the GFW is designed as an on-path/man-on-
the-side (MotS) system which takes advantage of UDP-based
DNS resolution to inject fake responses when censored do-
mains are detected in users’ DNS queries.
More speciﬁcally, when the GFW detects a DNS query for
a censored domain, it will forge a response with an incorrect
DNS record towards the client. Some speciﬁc domains (e.g.,
google.sm) can trigger the GFW to emit up to three forged
responses [21]. As an on-path system, the GFW cannot mod-
ify or drop the legitimate response returned by the blocked
domain’s authoritative name server or the public resolver cho-
sen by the client. However, since the GFW is usually closer
(in terms of physical/network distance) to the client, the in-
jected response will usually arrive ahead of the legitimate one
(§7.2), thus being accepted by the client who is now unable
to access the domain.
3 GFWatch Design
We designed GFWatch according to the following require-
ments: (1) the platform should be able to discover as many
censored domains and forged IPs as possible in a timely man-
ner. More speciﬁcally, GFWatch should be able to obtain
and test new domain names as they appear on the Internet.
(2) As a longitudinal measurement platform, once a domain
is discovered to be censored, GFWatch should continuously
keep track of its blocking status to determine whether the
domain stays censored or becomes unblocked at some point
in the future. (3) By measuring many domains with sufﬁcient
frequency, GFWatch is expected to provide us with a good
view into the pool of forged IPs used by the GFW.
3.1 Test Domains
We are interested in the timely discovery of as many cen-
sored domains as possible because we hypothesize that
the GFW does not block just well-known domains (e.g.,
facebook.com, twitter.com, tumblr.com) but also less
popular or even unranked ones that are of interest to smaller
groups of at-risk people (e.g., political dissidents, minority eth-
nic groups), who are often suppressed by local authorities [18].
Therefore, we opt to curate our test list from top-level domain
(TLD) zone ﬁles obtained from various sources, including
Verisign [16] and the Centralized Zone Data Service operated
by ICANN [5], which we refresh on a daily basis. Using zone
ﬁles not only provides us with a good coverage of domain
names on the Internet, but also helps us to fulﬁll the ﬁrst de-
sign goal of GFWatch, which is the capability to test new
domains as they appear on the Internet.
Since TLD zone ﬁles contain only second-level do-
mains (SLDs), they do not allow us to observe cases in
which the GFW censors subdomains of these SLDs. As
we show later, many subdomains (e.g., scratch.mit.edu,

nsarchive.gwu.edu, cs.colorado.edu) are censored but
their SLDs (e.g., mit.edu, gwu.edu, colorado.edu) are not.
We complement our test list by including domains from the
Citizen Lab test lists (CLTL) [13], the Tranco list [66], and the
Common Crawl project [14]. Between April and December
2020, we tested a total of 534M domains from 1.5K TLDs,
with an average of 411M domains daily tested.
3.2 Measurement Approach
When ﬁltering DNS trafﬁc, the GFW does not consider the
direction of request packets. As a result, even DNS queries
originating from outside the country can trigger the GFW if
they contain a censored domain, making this behavior a pop-
ular topic for measurement studies [21, 22, 27, 87]. Based on
the observation of this ﬁltering policy, we design GFWatch
to probe the GFW from outside of China to discover censored
domains and verify their blockage again from our controlled
machines located in China to validate our ﬁndings.
Prior work has shown that the GFW does not ﬁlter DNS
trafﬁc on ports other than the standard port 53 [21, 67], we
thus design our probe queries using this standard destination
port number. We observe that for major UDP-based DNS
query types (e.g., A, CNAME, MX, NS, TXT), the GFW injects the
forged responses with an IPv4 for type A queries and a bogus
IPv6 for type AAAA queries. In some rare cases, injections of
forged static CNAME records are also observed for a small
number of censored domains (§5.3).
For TCP-based queries that carry censored domains, RST
packets are injected instead of DNS responses [91]. Since
UDP is the default protocol for DNS in most operating sys-
tems, we choose to probe the GFW with UDP-based queries.
While using both TCP-based and UDP-based queries would
still allow us to detect censored domains, we opt to use UDP-
based queries because they also allow us to (1) collect the
forged IPs used in the injected DNS responses, and (2) con-
duct our measurement at scale, which would be otherwise
more challenging to achieve because a TCP-based measure-
ment at the same scale would require more computing and
network resources to handle stateful network connections.
As shown in Figure 1, GFWatch’s main prober is a ma-
chine located in an academic network in the United States,
where DNS censorship is not anticipated. A and AAAA DNS
queries for the test domains are sent towards two hosts in
China, which are under our control and do not have any DNS
resolution capabilities. Therefore, any DNS responses re-
turned to the main prober come from the GFW.
While prior studies have conﬁrmed the centralized blocking
policy of the GFW [38, 52, 85], to make sure this behavior is
still consistent and to detect any future changes, the two hosts
in China are located in two different autonomous systems
(ASes). From our measurement results, we conﬁrm that the
DNS blocking policy continues to be centralized, with the
same censored domains detected via the two probing paths.
After the main prober completes each probing batch, de-
tected censored domains are transferred to the Chinese hosts
and probed again from inside China towards our control ma-
chine, as shown in Figure 2. This way, we can verify that
censored domains discovered by our prober in the US are also
