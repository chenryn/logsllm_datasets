Could we add `Bool` to the list of types supported by `Threads.Atomic`?
Currently atomics only supports int types and float types, but I don't see any
reason why it couldn't also support booleans! :)
For now as a workaround, you have to use an `x = Threads.Atomic{UInt8}` and
always check `if x != 0` instead of just `if x`.
I couldn't find either a github issue or discourse thread about this already,
sorry if this is a duplicate. Thanks! :)
