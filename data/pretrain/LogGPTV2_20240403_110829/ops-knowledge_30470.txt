User: When trying to install cPickle using pycharm I get this:

Command "python setup.py egg_info" failed with error code 1 in C:\Users\Edwin\AppData\Local\Temp\pycharm-packaging\cpickle 
  You are using pip version 7.1.2, however version 8.1.2 is available.
  You should consider upgrading via the 'python -m pip install --upgrade pip' command.

So then when I go command prompt to type in:

python -m pip install --upgrade pip

I get this:

'python' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.

So how do I install cPickle?
BTW: I am using windows & python 3.5.1
Assistant: As suggested in the comments, this is most likely because Python is not added to your environment variables. If you do not want to touch your environment variables, and assuming your Python is installed in C:\Python35\, 

Navigate tp C:\Python35\ in Windows Explorer
Go to the address bar and type cmd to shoot up a command prompt in that directory

Alternatively to steps 1 and 2, directly shoot up a command prompt, and cd to your Python installation Directory (default: C:\Python35)

Type python -m pip install pip --upgrade there
