User: I need to know if I can connect 2 PCs over Ethernet connection (point to point connection).
I have 2 machines (one of them runs on Windows XP and the other runs on Ubuntu Linux 10.10) and I need to have connection between them. Will be possible to have connection between them ?
The suggested language is either Python or C/C++.
Any ideas ?
to be more specific, LabVIEW is running on the Windows machine and choice will be either Python or C/C++ on the Linux machine.
Assistant: In LabVIEW/Windows you'll need to create a TCP-listen function on a specific port (server). From the linux box you'll start a connection as a client.
