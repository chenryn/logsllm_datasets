User: I have a folder full of image files such as 

1500000704_full.jpg
1500000705_full.jpg
1500000711_full.jpg
1500000712_full.jpg
1500000714_full.jpg
1500000744_full.jpg
1500000745_full.jpg
1500000802_full.jpg
1500000803_full.jpg 

I need to rename the files based on a lookup from a text file which has entries such as,

SH103239 1500000704
SH103240 1500000705
SH103241 1500000711
SH103242 1500000712
SH103243 1500000714
SH103244 1500000744
SH103245 1500000745
SH103252 1500000802
SH103253 1500000803
SH103254 1500000804

So, I want the image files to be renamed,

SH103239_full.jpg
SH103240_full.jpg
SH103241_full.jpg
SH103242_full.jpg
SH103243_full.jpg
SH103244_full.jpg
SH103245_full.jpg
SH103252_full.jpg
SH103253_full.jpg
SH103254_full.jpg

How can I do this job the easiest? Any one can write me a quick command or script which can do this for me please? I have a lot of these image files and manual change isnt feasible. 
I am on ubuntu but depending on the tool I can switch to windows if need be. Ideally I would love to have it in bash script so that I can learn more or simple perl or python.
Thanks
EDIT: Had to Change the file names
Assistant: Read in the text file, create a hash with the current file name, so files['1500000704'] = 'SH103239' and so on. Then go through the files in the current directory, grab the new filename from the hash, and rename it.
