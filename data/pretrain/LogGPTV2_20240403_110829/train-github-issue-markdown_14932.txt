##### Description of the problem
It seems like the standard geometries have faces as indices/elements. But it
appears like gl.drawArrays is being used. I'm assuming that there is a way for
drawElements to be used instead, to minimize the attribute buffer sizes, using
the face element/index values.
Also, as I get into ShaderMaterials, I'd prefer to have attribute arrays the
size of the number of unique vertices, with color, positions etc the same size
as well, using drawElements to manage duplications .. i.e. 4 vertices per
rectangle, with 6 elements for its two triangles.
What is the method used to have WebGLRenderer use drawElements? Possibly
WebGLIndexedBufferRenderer?
