**Title: Finding Our Path: Enhancing Active Directory Security**

Active Directory (AD) remains the backbone of identity, authentication, and security for organizations of all sizes. Over time, AD environments often become complex and unwieldy, with a dynamic web of operating systems, user behaviors, and configurations. Historically, understanding the implications of a single user logon or configuration could take hours, and comprehending the impact of millions of such events was nearly impossible.

In this presentation, we will share our success stories, lessons learned, and methodologies for identifying, understanding, and mitigating the risks associated with diverse user behaviors and configurations. Whether your network includes 50, 5,000, or 500,000 computers connected to AD, you will leave this talk with actionable insights on how to significantly improve your organization's AD security posture in days or weeks, rather than years.

We will also demonstrate several newly tracked attack vectors by BloodHound, including Resource-Based Constrained Delegation. These demonstrations will provide a deeper understanding of potential vulnerabilities and how to address them effectively.
