## Abstract
Measuring and understanding the end-user browsing Quality of Experience (QoE) is crucial for Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) to retain customers and increase revenue. MNOs often use traffic traces to detect bottlenecks and study user experience. Recent studies show that Above The Fold (ATF) time better approximates user browsing QoE compared to traditional metrics like Page Load Time (PLT). This work focuses on developing a methodology to measure web browsing QoE over operational Mobile Broadband (MBB) networks. We implemented a web performance measurement tool, WebLAR (Web Latency And Rendering), which measures web Quality of Service (QoS) metrics such as TCP connect time and Time To First Byte (TTFB), and web QoE metrics including PLT and ATF time. We deployed WebLAR on 128 MONROE nodes and conducted a two-week web measurement campaign in May and July 2018, targeting eight websites across six operational MBB networks. The results show that, in the median case, the TCP connect time and TTFB in Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks are 160% and 30% longer than in fixed-line networks, respectively. DNS lookup time and TCP connect time vary significantly across MNOs. Most websites do not show significant differences in PLT and ATF time across operators. However, Yahoo shows longer ATF time in Norwegian operators compared to Swedish operators. User mobility has a small impact on ATF time. Website design should be considered when approximating ATF time.

## 1. Introduction
Recent studies indicate that mobile data traffic is increasing exponentially, with web browsing being one of the dominant applications on MBB networks [13]. The reliance on MBB networks and the widespread availability of LTE have raised user expectations for fast, reliable, and pervasive connectivity. Users hold MNOs responsible for any shortcomings in their mobile experience [5]. This demand pushes MNOs to enhance the capabilities of mobile networks for emerging applications. One challenging use case for MBB networks is the mobility scenario, such as browsing the web while commuting on a high-speed train [28]. For MNOs, it is essential to understand the end-user browsing experience on their network [16]. Users are primarily concerned with the fulfillment of quality expectations rather than the level of QoS metrics like throughput.

Several efforts have been made to measure and understand the performance of MBB networks (Sect. 4). Tools like NetRadar [34, 37], SamKnows broadband measurement [12], and Meteor [32] have been developed to measure QoS metrics from MBB networks. These tools either focus on measuring QoS metrics or do not indicate how these metrics are used to measure QoE. Additionally, web performance and QoE have been well studied [3, 9, 13, 14, 19, 25–27, 33]. However, most studies investigating mobile web QoE are either from lab experiments or do not cover a wide range of metrics to approximate the end-user browsing experience. Consequently, our understanding of web QoE on operational MNOs is limited, mainly due to the lack of large-scale measurements and the unvalidated mapping of network QoS to subjective QoE for mobile networks.

Our first contribution in this work (Sect. 2) is the design and development of WebLAR [7], a lightweight tool for measuring the end-user web experience over operational MNOs. WebLAR can be deployed at scale and captures web latency and QoE metrics at different layers, such as DNS lookup time, TCP connect time, PLT, and ATF time. The ATF time is the time required to show the content in the browser's current viewport [15]. Previous studies [9, 25] used different approaches to approximate ATF time in fixed-line networks. Asrese et al. [9] used a pixel-wise comparison of changes in the browser's viewport, while Hora et al. [25] used browser timing information. By adopting these methods, we designed WebLAR to approximate ATF time in operational MNOs. WebLAR also captures network and device-level metadata, such as radio access technology, GPS locations, CPU, and memory usage. Different confounding factors, such as the device, affect QoE. In this work, we build a baseline view using MONROE, a platform for performing measurements in a more controlled setting.

The second contribution of this work (Sect. 3) is the insights derived from the dataset collected using WebLAR. We deployed WebLAR on MONROE [6], a Europe-wide experimental platform for MBB network measurement. We measured the performance of eight popular websites from 128 stationary and mobile MONROE nodes distributed across Norway and Sweden. Due to data quota limitations, we selected eight popular websites (Appendix A) in Norway and Sweden. Our analysis shows differences in DNS lookup time and TCP connect time across different MNOs. For most websites, there is no significant difference in PLT and ATF time across operators. However, Yahoo shows a significant variation in ATF time between Norwegian and Swedish MNOs, with longer ATF times in Norwegian MNOs. Additionally, user mobility does not significantly affect web QoE.

The applicability of the aforementioned approaches [9, 25] to approximate ATF time has not been validated for webpages with different design styles. Using the dataset collected with WebLAR, we showed that website design should be considered when using browser timing information and pixel-wise comparison approaches to approximate ATF time (Sect. 3.3). We also found that a three-second threshold is sufficient to determine when the content in the above-the-fold area stabilizes. To encourage reproducibility [11], we open-sourced the tool [7] and released the collected dataset along with Jupyter notebooks [10] for parsing and analyzing the results.

## 2. Experiment Design
We begin by presenting our methodology (Sect. 2.1) to approximate the ATF time of websites. We provide details on the design, experimental workflow (Sect. 2.2), and implementation aspects (Sect. 2.3) of WebLAR required for its deployment on the MONROE platform.

### 2.1 Methodology
The content in the above-the-fold area of the webpage (i.e., the content within the current viewport of the browser) is crucial for users to judge whether the page has downloaded and rendered. Therefore, the time at which the content in the above-the-fold area stops changing and reaches its final state is an objective metric to approximate user QoE [15]. We refer to this as ATF time. One way to approximate ATF time is by monitoring pixel changes in the visible part of the webpage and detecting when it stabilizes [9]. Another method is using browser performance timing information [25]. Browsers provide APIs to retrieve performance and navigation time information. Both approaches have limitations. The webpage may not stabilize due to animating content, making it difficult to detect stabilization using the pixel-wise approach. Conversely, identifying the exact location of some objects can be challenging, complicating the use of browser timing APIs. Thus, one approach may better approximate ATF time for certain types of websites, while the other may underestimate or overestimate it.

Recent studies [9, 25] have developed tools to estimate ATF time in fixed-line networks. We extend this by designing and developing WebLAR, which measures web QoE in cellular networks by combining both approaches. WebLAR can approximate ATF time using both pixel-wise comparison [9] and browser performance timing information [25]. Unlike [9], where the system approximates ATF time by downloading all web objects at the measurement nodes and processing them centrally, we approximate ATF time directly at the MONROE nodes. We refer to this method as ATFp time. Hora et al. [25] developed a Google Chrome extension to approximate ATF time, requiring user interaction. Since the mobile version of Google Chrome does not support extensions, we close this gap by approximating ATF time in measurement probes mimicking mobile devices. We refer to this approach as ATFb time. WebLAR also records metrics such as DNS lookup time, TCP connect time, TTFB, and PLT using browser APIs. It captures web complexity metrics, including the number and size of web objects, and metadata about network conditions, GPS coordinates, and CPU and memory usage.

### 2.2 Experiment Workflow
Figure 1 illustrates the sequence of operations in the WebLAR experiment on the MONROE platform. The MONROE platform provides a web interface for users to submit custom experiments (#1 in Figure). The MONROE backend service schedules the submitted experiments to the selected nodes (#2) and starts the test execution according to the provided parameters. When a node receives the commands for executing an experiment, it checks if the Docker container containing the test is available locally. If not, it fetches the container from a remote repository. The node then starts the container with the specified parameters.

1. **Submit Experiment**: Users submit their custom experiments via the web interface.
2. **Schedule Experiment**: The MONROE backend schedules the experiment to the selected nodes.
3. **Change Default Interface**: The node changes the default interface.
4. **Record Metadata**: The node records metadata about network conditions and device status.
5. **Get Webpage**: The node sends an HTTP(s) GET request to the target web server.
6. **Capture Web QoS, Complexity, and ATF**: The node captures QoS metrics, web complexity, and ATF time.
7. **Calculate Rendering Time**: The node calculates the rendering time.
8. **Stop Metadata Recording**: The node stops recording metadata.

This structured approach ensures consistent and reliable data collection across multiple nodes and experiments.
