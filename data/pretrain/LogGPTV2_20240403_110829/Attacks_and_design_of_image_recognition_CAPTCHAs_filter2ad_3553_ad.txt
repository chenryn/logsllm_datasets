refers to repeated patterns with varying intensities or colors such as 
grassland.  Contrast  is  a  simple  representation  of  texture.    Shape 
represents a visual object, represented by the outer boundary of the 
shape or the entire region of the shape. Color layout includes both 
the  color  feature  and  the  spatial relations.  More  low-level  features 
can  be  found  in  [23].  Computers  are  typically  good  at  extracting 
low-level features from an image.  
High-level  semantics,  on  the  other  hand,  is  associated  with 
perception  or  interpretation  of  an  image  such  as  identifying 
semantically  meaningful  objects  contained  in  an  image,  and 
relationships  of  these  objects.  Low-level  features  are  typically 
deterministic,  i.e.,  the  same  or  similar  result  is  produced  when  a 
low-level  feature  is  extracted  from  the  same  image  by  any 
computer or most humans at any time. High-level semantics, on the 
other hand, may be subjective and user-dependent, especially when 
interpretation  is  applied  during  extraction.  Different  semantic 
meanings  may  be  generated  when  the  same  image  is  perceived  by 
different  people or  by  the  same  person  at different  times.  There  is 
still  a  large  gap  between  low-level  features  and  high-level 
semantics. Image understanding or general object recognition aims 
to  reduce  such  a  gap  but  still  remains  a  hard  AI  problem  in 
computer vision.  
4.2  Attack on Asirra 
Golle  [24]  designed  a  machine  learning  attack  on  Asirra.  In  this 
attack, an image is partitioned and divided into uniform blocks. The 
discriminative  features  used  in  the  attack  are  the  block's  color 
patterns  and  5x5  texture  tiles.  Machine  learning  on  the  labeled 
training  data  produces  a  classifier  that  has  achieved  a  success  rate 
of  82.7%  in  distinguishing  a  cat from  a  dog  used  by  Asirra,  much 
higher  than  a  random  guess  does.  For  a  12-image  Asirra,  the 
success  rate  is  10.3%.  However,  no  insightful  explanation  was 
given on why a seemingly hard object recognition problem can be 
readily solved by a machine learning attack.   
4.3  Attack on ARTiFACIAL 
We  have  developed  a  machine  learning  attack  on  ARTiFACIAL 
[25].  There  are  two  stages  in  the  attack:  detect  the  face  in  a 
192 
challenge  and  then  locate  the  six  facial  corner  points  on  the  face. 
Based on the observation that the intensity perturbation introduced 
by ARTiFACIAL could be largely removed in the gradient domain 
which  represents  spatial  variations  of  the  image's  intensities,  we 
have designed a gradient-domain based face detector that learns the 
structural  shapes  of  facial  components  to  detect  the  face  in  a 
challenge

representation  of  the  challenge  image  shown  in  Figure  1(c).  Then 
the intensity perturbation which manifests as horizontal and vertical 
lines  in  the  gradient  domain  is  neutralized  (Figure  5(b)), thanks  to 
their very different patterns from the gradient of a human face.

The  discriminative  facial  structural  features  obtained  by  machine 
learning  are  applied  to  detect  location  and  orientation  of  the  face. 
Figure 6 shows the top 5 features produced by the machine learning 
process. They represent structure features on the eyes and nose of a 
face. When tested on 800 challenge images, the face detection rate 
was  42.0%.  The  red  tilted  rectangle  in  Figure  5(c)  shows  the 
detected face for the challenge shown in Figure 1(c). After the face 
detection, a facial component-based discriminative algorithm and a 
refinement  algorithm  is  then  applied  to  the  detected  face  to  locate 
the  six  corner  points.  The  success  rate  to  correctly  identify  the  six 
corner  points  on  a  face  detected  at  the  first  stage  was  42.9%.  The 
overall  success  rate  to  pass  an  ARTiFACIAL  test  is  therefore 
42.0%	×42.9% ,  or  18.0%.  The  average  time  to  produce  a 
response  was  1.47s  when  tested  with  the  800  challenges  on  a  PC 
with 3.2GHz Intel P4 and 2GB memory.

5.  A SIMPLE FRAMEWORK 
In  this  section,  we  propose  a  simple  framework  for  understanding 
the design of a good IRC. We first examine the design flaws in the 
three  reprehensive  IRCs  that  led  to  successful  attacks.  We  then 
propose three guidelines in designing robust IRCs.  
5.1  Lessons from Successful Attacks 
The task in the click test of IMAGINATION [13] is to distinguish 
authentic  image  boundaries  from  false  image  boundaries  such  that 
at least the boundary of one constituent image is identified. Humans 
decide  that  a  boundary  is  likely  false  if  the  two  sides  of  the 
boundary  are  correlated  since  two  randomly  selected  images  are 
unlikely  correlated.  This  eliminating  process  is  iteratively  applied 
until  an  image's  boundary  is  confidently  identified.  This  iterative 
process  can  be  readily  performed  by  machines  through  computing 
low-level features of the image. That is, a cognitive decision about 
whether  both  sides  of  a  boundary  are  correlated  or  not  can  be 
approximated  by  detecting  similarity  of  textures  and  continuity  of 
193 
traversing objects. No image recognition or semantics is necessarily 
used. This explains why the click test of IMAGINATION fails.  
•  Lesson  #1.  An  IRC  that  does  not  rely  on  image  semantics  is 
doomed  to  be  vulnerable  to  automated  machine  attacks.  For 
such  an  IRC,  the  human’s  natural  cognitive  “algorithm”  for 
passing  the  CAPTCHA  test  can  be  imitated  or  approximated 
by  machines  automatically  computing  certain 
low-level 
discriminative features – such a task can be readily performed 
by a computer, and sometimes done even more accurately by a 
computer  than  by  humans.  Instead,  image  recognition  task 
must be introduced in an IRC.  
The  task  to  solve  an  Asirra  challenge  is  a  binary  classification 
problem, as the image is of either a dog or a cat. It is still an open 
problem  how  human  beings  exactly  carry  out  such  classification 
tasks,  but  it  is  believed  that  cognitive  capability  of  image 
recognition is needed to perform the tasks. Although computers do 
not  have  such  a  capability,  Asirra  was  broken  by  computers  for  a 
simple reason: often it is sufficient to compute low-level features to 
achieve binary classification.  
A  common  method  for  binary  classification  is  to  identify  a  set  of 
discriminative  low-level  features  and  use  machine  learning  on 
empirical  training  data  to  automatically  learn  both  the  common 
patterns  among  the  individual  objects  of  each  type,  and  the  most 
effective  discriminative  patterns  to  distinguish  objects  of  one  type 
from  objects  of  the  other  type.  The  training  data  contain  positive 
samples  which  are  objects  of  the  type  that  the  classifier  wants  to 
identify (cats in Asirra's case) and also negative samples which are 
objects  of  the  other  type.  Golle's  attack  [24]  used  two  simple  yet 
highly discriminative low-level features: texture and color patterns. 
Texture patterns are highly discriminative in this case. For example, 
cats  usually  have  patterns  of  furs  and  whiskers,  which  are  very 
different  from  those  of  dogs.  Although  not  used  in  Golle’s  attack, 
shapes  would  be  another  highly  discriminative  low-level  feature 
since  cats  and  dogs  typically  have  very  distinctive  ear  shapes.  In 
fact, a recent study [26] on cat detection using machine learning on 
texture and shape patterns claimed a success rate of above 90% for 
cat detection. Note that cat detection is harder than identifying cats 
from a collection of cats and dogs since detection faces much more 
variations in the background or cluttering objects.  
Although  it  is  unclear  how  much  semantic  discrimination  humans 
use  in  solving  Asirra's  binary  classification  problem,  we  have 
experienced that in many cases, substantial low-level features in the 
images  aided  humans  to  distinguish  cat  images  from  dog  images. 
On the other hand, rather than an IQ test, a CAPTCHA is designed 
to let most humans easily pass in a short time. To be user friendly, 
an  IRC  based  on  a  binary  classification  problem  needs  to  use 
images  of  objects  that  can  be  easily  and  unambiguously  identified 
by  most  humans.  This  implies  that  the  objects  of  each  type  share 
easily  perceived  common  features,  some  of  which  are  highly 
discriminative that humans can readily apply to distinguish between 
the  two  types.  Some  of  these  perceivable  discriminative  features 
should be associated with or reflect in low-level features; otherwise 
it  is  unlikely  for  most  humans  to  produce  the  same  result  for  a 
challenge,  as  required  by  the  usability  of  an  IRC,  since  high-level 
semantics  tends  to  be  subjective  and  use-dependent.  Low-level 
features, on the other hand, are typically deterministic, and can lead 
to  a  consistent  and  unambiguous  result  by  most  humans.  By 
identifying  and  selecting  a  set  of  highly  discriminative  low-level 
features, adversaries can apply  machine learning on empirical data 
to  find  effective  decision  criteria  to  distinguish  between  the  two 
types,  resulting  in  an  automated  effective  attack.  Therefore,  we 
have the following lesson.  
•  Lesson  #2.  A  user-friendly  IRC  based  on  a  binary 
classification  problem  to  classify  an  object  into  one  of  two 
fixed  types  a  priori  of  concrete  objects 3  is  highly  likely 
vulnerable to machine learning attacks.  
ARTiFACIAL  [12]  relies  on  face  detection.  In  general,  an  object 
detection  problem  is  harder  than  a  binary  classification  problem 
since  the  negative  samples  for  the  latter  case  have  much  less 
variations,  making  the  classification  problem  easier.  In  our  attack 
on ARTiFACIAL, the spatial patterns of facial features are learned 
by machines as the discriminative features to identify the face in a 
challenge 
image  with  cluttering  background.  The  a  priori 
information  that  there  exists  one  and  only  one  face  in  a  challenge 
image  is  also  exploited  to  improve  the  detection  rate.  As  such,  an 
IRC based on object detection does not appear to be able to provide 
a significantly more secure design than a binary classification based 
IRC.   
•  Lesson #3. A user-friendly IRC based on detecting a concrete 
object of a fixed type a priori is very likely to be vulnerable to 
machine learning attacks.  
5.2  Guidelines for Designing Robust IRCs 
From  the  lessons  we  learned  in  Section  5.1,  we  would  summarize 
three guidelines to shed light on the design of a robust IRC.  
•  Guideline #1. Rely on unambiguous high-level semantics. 
This guideline is directly derived from the first lesson. One problem 
associated  with  using  semantics  is  that  the  retrieved  semantic 
information  from  an  image  tends  to  be  subjective  and  user-
dependent.  A  good  example  is  image  labeling,  where  different 
people  may  give  the  same  image  different  labels.  This  intrinsic 
ambiguity  in  semantics  makes  it  difficult  to  generate  CAPTCHA 
challenges using image semantics.  
However,  there  are  still  some  ways  to  use  semantics  without 
ambiguity  in  the  answer  and  thus  they  can  likely  be  used  in  IRC 
design. An example is spatial relationships of objects. Humans can 
understand relative sizes, shape changes and occlusion relationships 
of  different  objects,  and  can  deduce  spatial  relationships  of 
different  objects.  This  cognitive  process  involves  recognition  of 
objects,  and  thus  is  still  hard  for  computers  to  perform.  Another 
example 
relationships  of  objects.  Like  spatial 
relationships  of  objects,  deducing  logical  relationships  of  objects 
also involves recognition of objects, a hard AI problem.   
logical 
is 
•  Guideline  #2. Boost  robustness with  more  variations  such  as 
for  either 
relying  on  recognition  of  multi-type  objects 
detection or classification. 
Based  on  the  second  and  third  lessons,  the  task  of  either  binary 
classification  of  objects  from  two  types  a  priori  or  detecting  an 
object  of  one  type  a  priori  may  leave  sufficient  low-level  features 
that  can  be  efficiently  exploited  by  machine  learning  methods, 
resulting  in  a  seemingly  image  recognition  problem  solved  by 
computers. We can  make an IRC more secure by  making  machine 
3 A  concrete  object  means  an  object  that  is  unambiguously  and 
easily  defined  and  identified.  IRCs  usually  rely  on  concrete 
objects,  since  for  these  objects  human  users  can  generate 
consistent answers that can be easily verified by a machine.

learning attacks much harder than before. This can be achieved, for 
example, by increasing the number of concrete object types used in 
an  IRC.  Multi-label  classification  is  much  harder  for  computers 
than binary classification.  
It  appears  that  Guideline  #2  is  a  general  principle  which  is 
applicable to all CAPTCHAs including text schemes. For example, 
by increasing variations of segmentation-resistant mechanisms, text 
distortion  methods  and  fonts,  and  then  randomly  selecting  one  or 
more  fonts,  a  segmentation-resistance  mechanism  and  a  text 
distortion method in generating the current challenge, we can have 
a  text  CAPTCHA  that  is  more  robust  than  the  state-of-the-art, 
making an attacker’s life much harder.   
•  Guideline  #3.  Disable  machine  learning  by  eliminating  the 
possibility of using empirical data or a priori knowledge such 
as the types of objects. This means that a current challenge is 
independent  of  the  past  challenges  in  terms  of  computable 
features such as low-level image features.   
learning  by  making 
An  intrinsic  feature  for  all  machine  learning  attacks  is  that  they 
typically  rely  on  empirical  data  to  learn  effective  discriminative 
features  and decision  criteria  before  becoming  effective.  The  most 
fundamental  solution  to  deal  with  these  attacks  is  therefore  to 
disable  machine 
the  past  challenges 
uncorrelated with the current or future challenges. In this way, the 
discriminative  features  or  decision  criteria  learned  from  the  past 
challenges  would  be  ineffective  to  solve  the  current  or  a  future 
challenge.  This  can  be  achieved  by  randomly  selecting  a  type  and 
an object of the type to generate a challenge, with both the number 
of  types  and  the  number  of  individual  objects  of  each  type  being 
sufficiently  large,  infinite  ideally,  so  that  it  is  intractable  for  the 
current  computing  capability.  This  is  the  ultimate  goal,  although 
hard to achieve.  
In principle, Guideline #3 is applicable to all CAPTCHAs. For text 
CAPTCHAs,  however,  it  is  still  an  open  problem  whether  we  can 
create an unlimited number of  segmentation-resistant mechanisms, 
or  an  unlimited  number  of  combinations  of  segmentation-resistant 
mechanisms and text-distortion methods.  
6.  A NOVEL IMAGE BASED CAPTCHA 
A  novel  IRC,  Cortcha  (Context-based  Object  Recognition  to  Tell 
Computers and Humans Apart), is presented in this section.
