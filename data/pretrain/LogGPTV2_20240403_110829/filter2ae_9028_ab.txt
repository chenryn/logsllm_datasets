    can you go on loving this place?
    ---------    Sometimes I wonder,
    what if this town was alive?
    What if it had thoughts and feelings
    like one of us?
    If it did,
    I think it would want to make the people
    who live here happy.
    ---------    Expectations are what you have
    when you have given up.
    Expectations are born from
    a despairingly large difference in skill.
    ---------    A joke only lasts for a moment,
    if it leaves a misunderstanding,
    it becomes a lie.
    ---------    If someone didn't have any pride,
    wouldn't they also be lacking
    in self-confidence?
    If someone was free of greed,
    wouldn't they have trouble
    supporting their family?
    And if people didn't envy one another,
    wouldn't they stop inventing new things?
    ---------    If I don't have to do it, I won't.
    If I have to do it, I'll make it.

本题为python脚本编写题目，nc对面的端口，对面发来一些表达式，需要再规定时间内计算出这些表达式，并且将计算结果返回到对面。解出来之后发现是30s内算100道表达式。服务器从第50道题之后开始发一些不正规的表达式，这时候需要将里面的一些东西替换为0，具体看代码。  
结果：  
python代码：

    import socket
    import re
    HOST = '202.38.95.46'    # The remote host

    s = None
