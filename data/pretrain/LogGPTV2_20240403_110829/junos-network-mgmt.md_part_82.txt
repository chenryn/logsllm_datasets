1019
Port mirroring can be used for traffic analysis on routers and switches that, unlike hubs, do not
broadcast packets to every port on the destination device. Port mirroring sends copies of all packets or
policy-based sample packets to local or remote analyzers where you can monitor and analyze the data.
In the context of port mirroring analyzers, we use the term switching device. The term indicates that the
device (including routers) is performing a switching function.
You can use analyzers on a packet level to help you:
• Monitor network traffic
• Enforce network usage policies
• Enforce file sharing policies
• Identify the causes of problems
• Identify stations or applications with heavy or abnormal bandwidth usage
You can configure port mirroring to mirror:
• Bridged packets (Layer 2 packets)
• Routed packets (Layer 3 packets)
Mirrored packets can be copied to either a local interface for local monitoring or a VLAN or bridge
domain for remote monitoring.
The following packets can be copied:
• Packets entering or exiting a port—You can mirror packets entering or exiting ports, in any
combination, for up to 256 ports. For example, you can send copies of the packets entering some
ports and the packets exiting other ports to the same local analyzer port or analyzer VLAN.
• Packets entering or exiting a VLAN or bridge domain—You can mirror the packets entering or exiting
a VLAN or bridge domain to either a local analyzer port or to an analyzer VLAN or bridge domain.
You can configure multiple VLANs (up to 256 VLANs) or bridge domains as ingress inputs to an
analyzer, including a VLAN range and private VLANs (PVLANs).
• Policy-based sample packets—You can mirror a policy-based sample of packets that are entering a
port, VLAN, or bridge domain. You configure a firewall filter with a policy to select the packets to be
mirrored. You can send the sample to a port-mirroring instance or to an analyzer VLAN or bridge
domain.
Analyzer Overview
You can configure an analyzer to define both the input traffic and the output traffic in the same analyzer
configuration. The input traffic to be analyzed can be either traffic that enters or traffic that exits an
1020
interface or VLAN. The analyzer configuration enables you to send this traffic to an output interface,
instance, next-hop group, VLAN, or bridge domain. You can configure an analyzer at the [edit forwarding-
options analyzer] hierarchy level.
Statistical Analyzer Overview
You can define a set of mirroring properties, such as mirroring rate and maximum packet length for
traffic, that you can explicitly bind to physical ports on the router or switch. This set of mirroring
properties constitutes a statistical analyzer (also called a non-default analyzer). At this level, you can
bind a named instance to the physical ports associated with a specific FPC.
Default Analyzer Overview
You can configure an analyzer without configuring any mirroring properties (such as mirroring rate or
maximum packet length). By default, the mirroring rate is set to 1 and the maximum packet length is set
to the complete length of the packet. These properties are applied at the global level and need not be
bound to a specific FPC.
Port Mirroring at a Group of Ports Bound to Multiple Statistical Analyzers
You can apply up to two statistical analyzers to the same port groups on the switching device. By
applying two different statistical analyzer instances to the same FPC or Packet Forwarding Engine, you
can bind two distinct Layer 2 mirroring specifications to a single port group. Mirroring properties that
are bound to an FPC override any analyzer (default analyzer) properties bound at the global level on the
switching device. Default analyzer properties are overridden by binding a second analyzer instance on
the same port group.
Port Mirroring Analyzer Terminology
Table 121 on page 1021 lists some port mirroring analyzer terms and their descriptions.
1021
Table 121: Analyzer Terminology
Term Description
Analyzer In a mirroring configuration, the analyzer includes:
• The name of the analyzer
• Source (input) ports, VLANs, or bridge domains
• The destination for mirrored packets (either a local port, VLAN, or bridge
domain)
Analyzer output interface Interface where mirrored traffic is sent and a protocol analyzer is connected.
(Also known as a monitor Interfaces used as output to an analyzer must be configured under the
port) forwarding-options hierarchy level.
Analyzer output interfaces have the following limitations:
• They cannot also be a source port.
• They do not participate in Layer 2 protocols, such as the Spanning Tree
Protocol (STP).
• If the bandwidth of the analyzer output interface is not sufficient to handle
the traffic from the source ports, overflow packets are dropped.
Analyzer VLAN or bridge VLAN or bridge domain to where mirrored traffic is sent to be used by a protocol
domain analyzer. The member interfaces in the monitor VLAN or bridge domain are
spread across the switching devices in your network.
(Also known as a monitor
VLAN or bridge domain)
Bridge-domain-based An analyzer session configured to use bridge domains for input, output or both.
analyzer
Default analyzer An analyzer with default mirroring parameters. By default, the mirroring rate is 1
and the maximum packet length is the length of the complete packet.
1022
Table 121: Analyzer Terminology (Continued)
Term Description
Input interface An interface on the switching device where the traffic entering or exiting this
interface is mirrored.
(Also known as mirrored
ports or monitored
interfaces)
LAG-based analyzer An analyzer that has a link aggregation group (LAG) specified as the input
(ingress) interface in the analyzer configuration.
Local mirroring An analyzer configuration in which packets are mirrored to a local analyzer port.
Monitoring station A computer running a protocol analyzer.
Analyzer based on next-hop An analyzer configuration that uses the next-hop group as the output to an
group analyzer.
Port-based analyzer An analyzer configuration that defines interfaces for input and output.
Protocol analyzer application An application used to examine packets transmitted across a network segment.
Also commonly called a network analyzer, packet sniffer or probe.
Remote mirroring Functions the same way as local mirroring, except that the mirrored traffic is not
copied to a local analyzer port but is flooded to an analyzer VLAN or bridge
domain that you create specifically for the purpose of receiving mirrored traffic.
Mirrored packets have an additional outer tag of the analyzer VLAN or bridge
domain.
Statistical analyzer A set of mirroring properties that you can explicitly bind to the physical ports on
the switch. This set of analyzer properties is known as a statistical analyzer.
(Also known as a non-default
analyzer)
VLAN-based analyzer An analyzer configuration that uses VLANs to deliver the mirrored traffic to the
analyzer.
1023
Configuration Guidelines for Port Mirroring Analyzers
When you configure port mirroring analyzers. we recommend that you follow these guidelines to ensure
optimum benefit. We recommend that you disable mirroring when you are not using it, and that you
select specific interfaces as input to the analyzer rather than using the all keyword option, which
enables mirroring on all interfaces. Mirroring only necessary packets reduces any potential performance
impact.
You can also limit the amount of mirrored traffic by:
• Using statistical sampling
• Using a firewall filter
• Setting a ratio to select a statistical sample
With local mirroring, traffic from multiple ports is replicated to the analyzer output interface. If the
output interface for an analyzer reaches capacity, packets are dropped. You must consider whether the
traffic being mirrored exceeds the capacity of the analyzer output interface.
Table 122 on page 1023 summarizes further configuration guidelines for analyzers.

EX9200 switches enable you to configure mirroring to send copies of packets to either a local interface
for local monitoring or to a VLAN for remote monitoring. You can use mirroring to copy the following
packets:
• Packets entering or exiting a port
• Packets entering or exiting a VLAN
BEST PRACTICE: Mirror only necessary packets to reduce potential performance impact. We
recommend that you:
• Disable the analyzers that you have configured when you are not using them.
1027
• Specify individual interfaces as input to analyzers rather than specifying all interfaces as
input.
• Limit the amount of mirrored traffic by:
• Using statistical sampling.
• Setting ratios to select statistical samples.
• Using firewall filters.
NOTE: If you want to create additional analyzers without deleting the existing analyzers, disable
the existing analyzers by using the disable analyzer analyzer-name statement from the command-
line-interface (CLI) or from the J-Web configuration page for mirroring.
NOTE: Interfaces used as output to an analyzer must be configured under the ethernet-switching
family, and must be associated to a VLAN.
Configuring an Analyzer for Local Traffic Analysis
To mirror network traffic or VLAN traffic on the switch to an interface on the switch by using analyzers:
1. Choose a name for the analyzer and specify the input:
[edit forwarding-options]
user@switch# set analyzer analyzer-name input ingress interface interface-name
For example, create an analyzer called employee-monitor to monitor the packets entering interfaces
ge-0/0/0.0 and ge-0/0/1.0:
[edit forwarding-options]
user@switch# set analyzer employee-monitor input ingress interface ge–0/0/0.0
[edit forwarding-options]
user@switch# set analyzer employee-monitor input ingress interface ge–0/0/1.0
1028
2. Configure the destination interface for the mirrored packets:
[edit forwarding-options]
user@switch# set analyzer analyzer-name output interface interface-name
For example, configure ge-0/0/10.0 as the destination interface for the employee-monitor analyzer:
[edit forwarding-options]
user@switch# set analyzer employee-monitor output interface ge-0/0/10.0
Configuring an Analyzer for Remote Traffic Analysis
To mirror traffic that is traversing interfaces or a VLAN on the switch to a VLAN used for analysis from a
remote location:
1. Configure a VLAN to carry the mirrored traffic:
[edit]
user@switch# set vlans analyzer-name vlan-id vlan-ID
For example, define an analyzer VLAN called remote-analyzer and assign it the VLAN ID 999:
[edit]
user@switch# set vlans remote-analyzer vlan-id 999
2. Set the interface that is connected to the distribution switch to access mode and associate it with the
analyzer VLAN:
[edit]
user@switch# set interfaces interface-name unit 0 family ethernet-switching interface-mode
access vlan members vlan-ID
For example, set the interface ge-0/1/1 to access mode and associate it with the analyzer VLAN ID
999:
[edit]
user@switch# set interfaces ge-0/1/1 unit 0 family ethernet-switching interface-mode access
vlan members 999
1029
3. Configure the analyzer:
a. Define an analyzer and specify the traffic to be mirrored:
[edit forwarding-options]
user@switch# set analyzer analyzer-name input ingress interface interface-name
For example, define the employee-monitor analyzer for which traffic to be mirrored comprises packets
entering interfaces ge-0/0/0.0 and ge-0/0/1.0:
[edit forwarding-options]
user@switch# set analyzer employee-monitor input ingress interface ge-0/0/0.0
[edit forwarding-options]
user@switch# set analyzer employee-monitor input ingress interface ge-0/0/1.0
b. Specify the analyzer VLAN as the output for the analyzer:
[edit forwarding-options]
user@switch# set analyzer analyzer-name output vlan vlan-ID
For example, specify the remote-analyzer VLAN as the output analyzer for the employee-monitor
analyzer:
[edit forwarding-options]
user@switch# set analyzer employee-monitor output vlan 999
Configuring a Statistical Analyzer for Local Traffic Analysis
To mirror interface traffic or VLAN traffic on the switch to an interface on the switch by using a
statistical analyzer:
1. Choose a name for the analyzer and specify the input interfaces:
[edit forwarding-options]
user@switch# set analyzer analyzer-name input ingress interface interface-name
[edit forwarding-options]
user@switch# set analyzer employee-monitor input ingress interface ge–0/0/1.0
1030
For example, specify an analyzer called employee-monitor and specify the input interfaces ge-0/0/0 and
ge-0/0/1:
[edit forwarding-options]
user@switch# set analyzer employee-monitor input ingress interface ge–0/0/0.0
[edit forwarding-options]
user@switch# set analyzer employee-monitor input ingress interface ge–0/0/1.0
2. Configure the destination interface for the mirrored packets:
[edit forwarding-options]
user@switch# set analyzer employee-monitor output interface interface-name
For example, configure ge-0/0/10.0 as the destination interface for the mirrored packets:
[edit forwarding-options]
user@switch# set analyzer employee-monitor output interface ge-0/0/10.0
3. Specify mirroring properties.
a. Specify the mirroring rate—that is, the number of packets to be mirrored per second:
[edit forwarding-options]
user@switch# set analyzer employee-monitor input rate number
The valid range is 1 through 65,535.
b. Specify at what length mirrored packets are truncated:
[edit forwarding-options]
user@switch# set analyzer employee-monitor input maximum-packet-length number
The valid range is 0 through 9216. The default value is 0, indicating that mirrored packets are not
truncated.
Configuring a Statistical Analyzer for Remote Traffic Analysis
To mirror traffic that is traversing interfaces or a VLAN on the switch to a VLAN for analysis from a
remote location by using a statistical analyzer:
1031
1. Configure a VLAN to carry the mirrored traffic:
[edit]
user@switch# set vlans vlan-name vlan-id vlan-ID
For example, configure a VLAN called remote-analyzer with VLAN ID 999:
[edit]
user@switch# set vlans remote-analyzer vlan-id 999
2. Set the interface that is connected to the distribution switch to access mode and associate it with the
VLAN:
[edit]
user@switch# set interfaces interface-name unit 0 family ethernet-switching interface-mode
access vlan members vlan-ID
For example, set the interface ge-0/1/1.0 that is connected to the distribution switch to access mode
and associate it with the remote-analyzer VLAN:
[edit]
user@switch# set interfaces ge-0/1/1.0 unit 0 family ethernet-switching interface-mode access
vlan members 999
3. Configure the statistical analyzer:
a. Specify the traffic to be mirrored:
[edit forwarding-options]
user@switch# set analyzer analyzer-name input ingress interface interface-name
For example, specify the packets entering ports ge-0/0/0.0 and ge-0/0/1.0 to be mirrored:
[edit forwarding-options]
user@switch# set analyzer employee-monitor input ingress interface ge-0/0/0.0
[edit forwarding-options]
user@switch# set analyzer employee-monitor input ingress interface ge-0/0/1.0
1032
b. Specify an output for the analyzer:
