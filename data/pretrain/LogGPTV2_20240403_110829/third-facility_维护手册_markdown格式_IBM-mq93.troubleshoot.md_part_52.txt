### Collecting Troubleshooting Information for IBM MQ

#### 1. Collecting Files and Directory Contents
- **On all systems:**
  - Include the `mqpatch.dat` and `mqpatch.log` files from the IBM MQ installation directory, if they exist.
  - List the contents (if any) of the directory where you were trying to install, update, or remove IBM MQ. For example:
    - **UNIX and Linux:**
      ```sh
      sh> ls -alR /path/to/mq > mqfiles.txt
      ```
    - **Windows:**
      ```cmd
      C:\> DIR /S "C:\Program Files\IBM\MQ" > %TEMP%\mqfile.txt
      ```
    - **IBM i Qshell:**
      ```sh
      ===> ls -alR /QIBM/UserData/mqm /QIBM/ProdData/mqm /QSYS.LIB/QMQM.LIB > /tmp/mqfile.txt
      ```

- **Manually package your files for IBM:**
  - Include files containing the output from the commands listed in Steps 1 and 2.
  - For new installations, skip over any directories or files that do not yet exist on the system.
  - Refer to the following sections for specific instructions:
    - “Manually packaging information on UNIX and Linux” on page 311
    - “Manually packaging information on Windows” on page 313
    - “Manually packaging information on IBM i” on page 313

### Collecting Information for Java and JMS Application Problems

#### Before You Begin
- Answer the following questions about the problem:
  - What Java or JMS problem did you observe on the system?
  - What time did the Java or JMS problem start and when did it stop?
  - Were any Java exceptions reported, and did they include a Java call stack?
  - Which queue managers, queues, and topics does the Java or JMS application use?

#### Procedure
1. **Generate an IBM MQ classes for Java trace or an IBM Java Message Service trace:**
   - Depending on whether your application uses the IBM MQ Java or JMS interface.
   - If your application is running under WebSphere Application Server, follow the trace instructions for that environment.

2. **Generate a trace of the client application while the problem is happening:**
   - Refer to the following sections for specific instructions:
     - “Tracing on AIX and Linux” on page 376
     - “Tracing on Windows” on page 391
     - “Tracing on IBM i” on page 381

3. **Collect the following information for the Java or JMS application:**
   - **If your application is running in WebSphere Application Server:**
     - Use its collector tool to gather information about the application server and its configuration, JNDI definitions, FFDC files, logs, and any traces generated in Steps 1 and 2.
       - WebSphere Application Server traditional 9.0.5
       - WebSphere Application Server 8.5.5
   - **If your application is running in another Java application server or in a Java SE environment:**
     - Collect the following files:
       - Standard output stream data (e.g., `System.out` or similar files).
       - Standard error stream data (e.g., `System.err` or similar files).
       - Java virtual machine log files (e.g., `native_stdout.log` and `native_stderr.log` or similar files).
       - The `mqjms.log` file, found by default in the application's current working directory.
       - The `mqjms_PID.trc` file, named for the process ID of the Java virtual machine, found in the same directory.
       - Any FFST files found in the FFDC subdirectory of the application's current working directory.

4. **Place the Java or JMS traces and logs from Steps 1 to 3, and, where applicable, the WebSphere Application Server collector, in the top-level IBM MQ errors directory.**

5. **Collect the IBM MQ data:**
   - You can do this either automatically or manually:
     - **Automatically:**
       - Use the `runmqras` command as described in “Collecting troubleshooting information automatically with runmqras” on page 303.
       - Example for collecting output from queue manager QMA:
         ```sh
         runmqras -section defs,topic,trace -qmlist QMA -caseno TS001234567
         ```
       - Example for collecting output from a client:
         ```sh
         runmqras -section trace -caseno TS001234567
         ```
     - **Manually:**
       - Follow the instructions in “Collecting troubleshooting information manually” on page 306.

6. **Send the information that you have collected to IBM.**
   - A good description of the problem and the data is the most important information you can provide to IBM. Do not send data without providing a description!
   - For FTP and email instructions, see “Exchanging information with IBM Software Support.”
   - To open or update a case, go to the IBM My Support site.
   - Always update your case to indicate that data was sent.
   - If you need to speak with IBM Software Support, contact your country representative. For support in the US, call 1-800-IBM-SERV.

### Collecting Information for Logging and Recovery Problems

#### Before You Begin
- Answer the following questions about the problem:
  - What logging or recovery problem did you observe on the system?
  - What time did the logging or recovery problem start and when did it stop?
  - What other details can you provide to help determine the cause of the problem?

#### Procedure
1. **Generate a trace of the queue manager while the problem is happening.**
   - Consider gathering a high detail trace if you have plenty of disk space.
   - Refer to the following sections for specific instructions:
     - “Tracing on AIX and Linux” on page 376
     - “Tracing on Windows” on page 391
     - “Tracing on IBM i” on page 381

2. **Dump the contents of the queue manager logs:**
   - This is particularly useful if you suspect a problem with the amount of data being logged.
   - Note: You must stop the queue manager in question to dump its logs. You must also provide the log path for the queue manager, which is defined with the `LogPath` attribute of the `Log` stanza in the `qm.ini` file.
   - Examples:
     - **On UNIX and Linux:**
       ```sh
       sh> endmqm -i QMA
       sh> dmpmqlog -b -m QMA -f /var/mqm/log/QMA > /tmp/QMA.dmpmqlog.txt
       sh> strmqm QMA
       ```
     - **On Windows:**
       ```cmd
       C:\> endmqm -i QMA
       C:\> dmpmqlog -b -m QMA -f "C:\ProgramData\IBM\MQ\log\QMA" > %TEMP%\QMA.dmpmqlog.txt
       C:\> strmqm QMA
       ```

3. **On Linux and UNIX systems, save the output from the `mqconfig` command.**

4. **Place the output from the `dmpmqlog` command and the `mqconfig` command in the top-level IBM MQ errors directory.**

5. **Collect the IBM MQ data:**
   - You can do this either automatically or manually:
     - **Automatically:**
       - Use the `runmqras` command as described in “Collecting troubleshooting information automatically with runmqras” on page 303.
       - Example for collecting output from queue manager QMA:
         ```sh
         runmqras -section defs,topic,trace -qmlist QMA -caseno TS001234567
         ```
       - Example for collecting output from a client:
         ```sh
         runmqras -section trace -caseno TS001234567
         ```
     - **Manually:**
       - Follow the instructions in “Collecting troubleshooting information manually” on page 306.

6. **Send the information that you have collected to IBM.**
   - A good description of the problem and the data is the most important information you can provide to IBM. Do not send data without providing a description!
   - For FTP and email instructions, see “Exchanging information with IBM Software Support.”

### Collecting Information for Managed File Transfer Problems

#### Before You Begin
- Answer the following questions about the problem:
  - What Managed File Transfer problem did you observe on the system?
  - What time did the Managed File Transfer problem start and when did it stop?
  - What is your IBM MQ file transfer topology, and where are the queue managers and what are their roles?
  - Which Managed File Transfer agents and loggers were involved in the problem?

#### Procedure
1. **If the problem involves TLS (formerly SSL) channel issues with a Managed File Transfer agent:**
   - Enable JSSE tracing in the agent and proceed with the following steps.

2. **If a Managed File Transfer process is hanging:**
   - Generate three javacores from the hanging process, delaying approximately one minute between each one.
   - Follow the instructions in Step 1 and Step 2 of “Collecting information for hang and high CPU problems” on page 324.

3. **Generate a trace of any failing MQ managed file transfer agent, logger, or other command and save the output of the failing command.**

4. **If the problem involves interaction with a queue manager:**
   - Generate a trace of the queue manager at the same time.
   - Refer to the following sections for specific instructions:
     - “Tracing on AIX and Linux” on page 376
     - “Tracing on Windows” on page 391
     - “Tracing on IBM i” on page 381

5. **Collect the data for Managed File Transfer agent problems:**
   - Save the output of the `fteShowAgentDetails` command:
     ```sh
     fteShowAgentDetails -bl -v AGENTNAME
     ```
     where `AGENTNAME` is the name of the agent with the problem.
   - Create an archive in the top-level IBM MQ errors directory which contains any Managed File Transfer traces and javacores that you have generated, as well as the logs, properties, and FFST files recorded by Managed File Transfer.
   - You can archive the Managed File Transfer files automatically using the `fteRAS` command, which will print a message `BFGCL0604I` to identify the location of the archive file when it is done. Alternatively, you can archive the files manually.
   - Warning: If there are a large number of Managed File Transfer agents configured on the server, the `fteRAS` command can take a long time to complete. If that happens, you can choose to compress the contents of the Managed File Transfer agent's logs and configuration directories into a zip file.
     - **To archive the Managed File Transfer files automatically using the `fteRAS` command:**
       - **On UNIX and Linux:**
         ```sh
         sh> fteRAS /var/mqm/errors
         ...
         BFGCL0604I: fteRAS command completed successfully. Output is stored in /var/mqm/errors/fteRAS.zip
         ```
       - **On Windows:**
         ```cmd
         C:\> fteRAS "C:\ProgramData\IBM\MQ\errors"
         ...
         BFGCL0604I: fteRAS command completed successfully. Output is stored in C:\ProgramData\IBM\MQ\errors\fteRAS.zip
         ```
       - **On IBM i:**
         ```sh
         ===> /QIBM/ProdData/mqm/bin/fteRAS /QIBM/UserData/mqm/errors
         ...
         BFGCL0604I: fteRAS command completed successfully. Output is stored in /QIBM/UserData/mqm/errors/fteRAS.zip
         ```
     - **To archive the Managed File Transfer files manually:**
       - **On UNIX and Linux:**
         - Copy the agent and logger javacores, traces, logs, properties, and FFST files. Include any interactive command traces and javacores written to the current directory or to other directories as well as the contents of:
           - `/var/mqm/mqft/logs/COORDQMNAME/*`
           - `/var/mqm/mqft/config/COORDQMNAME/*`
       - **On Windows:**
         - Copy the agent and logger javacores, traces, logs, properties, and FFST files. Include any interactive command traces and javacores written to the current directory or to other directories as well as the contents of the following directories:
           - `C:\Program Files\IBM\MQ\mqft\logs\COORDQMNAME\*`
           - `C:\Program Files\IBM\MQ\mqft\config\COORDQMNAME\*`
         - The actual path name of these directories depends on which version of IBM MQ you are using. For more information, see “Program and data directory locations on Windows.”
       - **On IBM i:**
         - Copy the agent and logger JVM dumps, traces, logs, properties, and FFST files. Include any interactive command traces and javacores you created (that is, spool files from the `GENJVMDMP` command), as well as the contents:
           - `/QIBM/UserData/mqm/mqft/logs/COORDQMNAME/*`
           - `/QIBM/UserData/mqm/mqft/config/COORDQMNAME/*`

6. **Collect the data for protocol bridge agent problems:**
   - In addition to enabling traces using the `fteSetAgentTraceLevel` command, use the `fteSetAgentLogLevel` command to enable logging of interactions between the protocol bridge agent (PBA) and the *FTP* servers with which it is interacting. For example:
     ```sh
     fteSetAgentLogLevel -logAgent=on PBAname
     ```

7. **Collect the data from the coordination queue manager:**
   - You can do this either automatically or manually:
     - **Automatically:**
       - Use the `runmqras` command as described in “Collecting troubleshooting information automatically with runmqras” on page 303.
       - Example:
         ```sh
         runmqras -section defs,mft,trace -qmlist COORDQMNAME -caseno TS001234567
         ```
     - **Manually:**
       - Follow the instructions in “Collecting troubleshooting information manually” on page 306.

8. **Send the information that you have collected to IBM.**
