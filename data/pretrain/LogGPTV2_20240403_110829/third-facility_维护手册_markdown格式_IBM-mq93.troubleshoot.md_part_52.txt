Collecting information for Java and JMS application problems
If you need assistance from IBM Support to resolve a problem with a Java or JMS application on
Multiplatforms, you first need to collect troubleshooting information to send to IBM Support to help find a
solution.
Before you begin
IBM recommends using the IBM MQ classes for Java in Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE)
application servers such as WebSphere Application Server. If you are using the IBM MQ classes for Java in
a Java EE environment, review the restrictions and other considerations for their usage.
Before you start this task, answer the following questions about the problem:
• What Java or JMS problem did you observe on the system?
• What time did the Java or JMS problem start and when did it stop?
• Were any Java exceptions reported, and did they include a Java call stack?
• Which queue managers, queues and topics does the Java or JMS application use?
332 Troubleshooting and Support for IBM MQ
About this task
It is essential to gather information from the system when the Java or JMS problem is happening in order
to identify the cause.
After collecting the troubleshooting information, you can send it to IBM.
Procedure
1.Generate an IBM MQ classes for Java trace or an IBM Java Message Service trace, depending on
whether your application uses the IBM MQ Java or JMS interface.
If your application is running under WebSphere Application Server, follow the trace instructions for
that environment.
2.Generate a trace of the client application while the problem is happening:
• “Tracing on AIX and Linux” on page 376
• “Tracing on Windows” on page 391
• “Tracing on IBM i” on page 381
3.Collect the following information for the Java or JMS application:
a)If your application is running in WebSphere Application Server, use its collector tool to gather
information about the application server and its configuration, JNDI definitions, FFDC files, logs,
and any traces generated in Steps 1 and 2:
• WebSphere Application Server traditional 9.0.5
• WebSphere Application Server 8.5.5
b)If your application is running in another Java application server or in a Java Platform, Standard
Edition (Java SE) environment, collect the following files:
• The standard output stream data (for example, System.out or similar files).
• The standard error stream data (for example, System.err or similar files).
• The Java virtual machine log files (for example, native_stdout.log and
native_stderr.log or similar files).
• The mqjms.log file, found by default in the application's current working directory.
• The mqjms_PID.trc file, named for the process ID of the Java virtual machine, found in the
same directory.
• Any FFST files found in the FFDC subdirectory of the application's current working directory.
4.Place the Java or JMS traces and logs from Steps 1 to 3, and, where applicable, the WebSphere
Application Server collector, in the top-level IBM MQ errors directory.
The automatic and manual data collection processes in Step “5” on page 333 both collect files found
in this directory.
5.Collect the IBM MQ data.
You can do this either automatically or manually:
• Collect the data automatically by using the runmqras command as described in “Collecting
troubleshooting information automatically with runmqras” on page 303. Be sure to collect the
runmqras trace section, and from queue managers the defs and topic sections as well, and
to specify your case number as shown in the following example for collecting output from queue
manager QMA:
runmqras -section defs,topic,trace -qmlist QMA -caseno TS001234567
IBM MQ troubleshooting and support 333
To collect output from a client, specify the trace section and your case number as shown in the
following example:
runmqras -section trace -caseno TS001234567
• Alternatively, collect the data manually as described in “Collecting troubleshooting information
manually” on page 306.
6.Send the information that you have collected to IBM.
A good description of the problem and the data is the most important information you can provide to
IBM. Do not send data without providing a description!
For FTP and email instructions, see Exchanging information with IBM Software Support.
To open or update a case, go to the IBM My Support site.
Note: Always update your case to indicate that data was sent.
If you need to speak with IBM Software Support, contact your country representative. If you need to
speak with IBM Software Support in the US, you can call 1-800-IBM-SERV.
Collecting information for logging and recovery problems
If you need assistance from IBM Support to resolve a problem where an IBM MQ queue manager is
reporting errors with logging data or recovering information from its logs on Multiplatforms, you first need
to collect troubleshooting information to send to IBM Support to help find a solution.
Before you begin
Before you start this task, answer the following questions about the problem:
• What logging or recovery problem did you observe on the system?
• What time did the logging or recovery problem start and when did it stop?
• What other details can you provide to help determine the cause of the problem?
About this task
If the logging or recovery problem is happening right now, or if you are able to reproduce it, you can
generate data to provide more information about the problem.
After collecting the troubleshooting information, you can send it to IBM.
Procedure
1.Generate a trace of the queue manager while the problem is happening.
Consider gathering a high detail trace if you have plenty of disk space:
• “Tracing on AIX and Linux” on page 376
• “Tracing on Windows” on page 391
• “Tracing on IBM i” on page 381
2.
On UNIX, Linux, and Windows, dump the contents of the queue manager logs.
This is particularly useful if you suspect a problem with the amount of data being logged.
Note: You must stop the queue manager in question in order to dump its logs. You must also provide
the log path for the queue manager. The log path is defined with the LogPath attribute of the Log
stanza of the qm.ini file.
The commands in the following examples use the dmpmqlog command to dump the contents of the
logs for queue manager QMA:
334 Troubleshooting and Support for IBM MQ
• On UNIX and Linux:
sh> endmqm -i QMA
sh> dmpmqlog -b -m QMA -f /var/mqm/log/QMA > /tmp/QMA.dmpmqlog.txt
sh> strmqm QMA
• On Windows:
C:\> endmqm -i QMA
C:\> dmpmqlog -b -m QMA -f "C:\ProgramData\IBM\MQ\log\QMA" > %TEMP%\QMA.dmpmqlog.txt
C:\> strmqm QMA
3.
On Linux and UNIX systems, save the output from the mqconfig command.
4.Place the output from the dmpmqlog command and the mqconfig command that you generated in
Steps 2 and 3 in the top-level IBM MQ errors directory.
The automatic and manual data collection processes in Step “5” on page 335 both collect files found
in this directory.
5.Collect the IBM MQ data.
You can do this either automatically or manually:
• Collect the data automatically by using the runmqras command as described in “Collecting
troubleshooting information automatically with runmqras” on page 303. Be sure to collect the
runmqras trace section, and from queue managers the defs and topic sections as well, and
to specify your case number as shown in the following example for collecting output from queue
manager QMA:
runmqras -section defs,topic,trace -qmlist QMA -caseno TS001234567
To collect output from a client, specify the trace section and your case number as shown in the
following example:
runmqras -section trace -caseno TS001234567
• Alternatively, collect the data manually as described in “Collecting troubleshooting information
manually” on page 306.
6.Send the information that you have collected to IBM.
A good description of the problem and the data is the most important information you can provide to
IBM. Do not send data without providing a description!

Collecting information for Managed File Transfer problems
If you need assistance from IBM Support to resolve a problem when a Managed File Transfer agent,
database logger or other command is reporting a problem or failing to work properly on Multiplatforms,
you first need to collect troubleshooting information to send to IBM Support to help find a solution.
Before you begin
Before you start this task, answer the following questions about the problem:
• What Managed File Transfer problem did you observe on the system?
• What time did the Managed File Transfer problem start and when did it stop?
IBM MQ troubleshooting and support 335
• What is your IBM MQ file transfer topology, and where are the queue managers and what are their roles?
• Which Managed File Transfer agents, and Managed File Transfer loggers were involved in the problem?
About this task
If the Managed File Transfer problem is happening right now, or if you are able to reproduce it, you can
generate data to provide more information about the problem.
After collecting the troubleshooting information, you can send it to IBM.
Note: The Managed File Transfer commands shown in the following steps require the coordination queue
manager identified in the installation.properties file to be the desired one, or correct one, or use
the -p command line option to identify the appropriate coordination queue manager.
Procedure
1.If the problem involves TLS (formerly SSL) channel issues with a Managed File Transfer agent, enable
JSSE tracing in the agent and carry on with the following steps.
2.If a Managed File Transfer process is hanging, generate three javacores from the hanging process,
delaying approximately one minute between each one.
To generate the javacores, follow the instructions in Step 1 and Step 2 of “Collecting information for
hang and high CPU problems” on page 324.
3.Generate a trace of any failing MQ managed file transfer agent, logger, or other command and save the
output of the failing command as well.
4.If the problem involves interaction with a queue manager, generate a trace of the queue manager at
the same time:
• “Tracing on AIX and Linux” on page 376
• “Tracing on Windows” on page 391
• “Tracing on IBM i” on page 381
5.Collect the data for Managed File Transfer agent problems.
For Managed File Transfer agent problems, save the output of the fteShowAgentDetails command:
fteShowAgentDetails -bl -v AGENTNAME
where AGENTNAME is the name of the agent with the problem.
Create an archive in the top-level IBM MQ errors directory which contains any Managed File Transfer
traces and javacores that you have generated as well as the logs, properties, and FFST files recorded
by Managed File Transfer. The automatic and manual data collection processes in Step “7” on page
337 both collect files found in the top-level IBM MQ errors directory.
You can archive the Managed File Transfer files automatically using the fteRAS command, which will
print a message BFGCL0604I to identify the location of the archive file when it is done. Alternatively,
for example if you are unable to use the fteRAS command, you can archive the files manually.
Warning: If there are a large number of Managed File Transfer agents configured on the server,
the fteRAS command can take a long time to complete. If that happens, you can choose to
compress the contents of the Managed File Transfer agent's logs and configuration directories
into a zip file.
a)To archive the Managed File Transfer files automatically using the fteRAS command:
336 Troubleshooting and Support for IBM MQ
• On UNIX and Linux, copy any interactive command traces and
javacores to the /var/mqm/errors directory and then run the fteRAS command as shown in the
following example:
sh> fteRAS /var/mqm/errors
...
BFGCL0604I: fteRAS command completed successfully. Output is stored in /var/mqm/errors/
fteRAS.zip
• On Windows, copy any interactive command traces and javacores to the top-level
IBM MQ errors directory. The actual path name of this directory depends on which version of IBM
MQ you are using. For more information, see Program and data directory locations on Windows.
Run the fteRAS command with the correct path name for your system.
C:\> fteRAS "C:\ProgramData\IBM\MQ\errors"
...
BFGCL0604I: fteRAS command completed successfully. Output is stored in
C:\ProgramData\IBM\MQ\errors\fteRAS.zip
• On IBM i, copy any interactive command traces and javacores you created (that is,
spool files from the GENJVMDMP command) to /QIBM/UserData/mqm/errors and then run the
fteRAS command from the Qshell as shown in the following example:
===> /QIBM/ProdData/mqm/bin/fteRAS /QIBM/UserData/mqm/errors
...
BFGCL0604I: fteRAS command completed successfully. Output is stored in /QIBM/
UserData/mqm/errors/fteRAS.zip
b)To archive the Managed File Transfer files manually:
• On UNIX and Linux, copy the agent and logger javacores, traces, logs,
properties and FFST files. Include any interactive command traces and javacores written to the
current directory or to other directories as well as the contents of:
/var/mqm/mqft/logs/COORDQMNAME/*
/var/mqm/mqft/config/COORDQMNAME/*
• On Windows, copy the agent and logger javacores, traces, logs, properties and FFST
files. Include any interactive command traces and javacores written to the current directory or to
other directories as well as the contents of the following directories.
C:\Program Files\IBM\MQ\mqft\logs\COORDQMNAME\*
C:\Program Files\IBM\MQ\mqft\config\COORDQMNAME\*
The actual path name of these directories depends on which version of IBM MQ you are using. For
more information, see Program and data directory locations on Windows.
• On IBM i, copy the agent and logger JVM dumps, traces, logs, properties and FFST
files. Include any interactive command traces and javacores you created (that is, spool files from
the GENJVMDMP command), as well as the contents:
/QIBM/UserData/mqm/mqft/logs/COORDQMNAME/*
/QIBM/UserData/mqm/mqft/config/COORDQMNAME/*
6.Collect the data for protocol bridge agent problems.
In addition to enabling traces using the fteSetAgentTraceLevel command use the
fteSetAgentLogLevel command to enable logging of interactions between the protocol bridge
agent (PBA) and the *FTP* servers with which it is interacting. For example:
fteSetAgentLogLevel -logAgent =on PBAname
7.Collect the data from the coordination queue manager.
You can do this either automatically or manually:
IBM MQ troubleshooting and support 337
• Collect the data automatically by using the runmqras command as described in “Collecting
troubleshooting information automatically with runmqras” on page 303. Be sure to collect the
runmqras defs and trace sections, and to specify your case number as shown in the following
example:
runmqras -section defs,mft,trace -qmlist AGENTQMNAME -caseno TS001234567
where COORDQMNAME is the name of the coordination queue manager.
• Alternatively, collect the data manually as described in “Collecting troubleshooting information
manually” on page 306.
8.Send the information that you have collected to IBM.
A good description of the problem and the data is the most important information you can provide to
IBM. Do not send data without providing a description!
