### Performance Optimizations

Performance optimizations are specifically tailored to this model.

### Why You Might Not Love Go

We recognize that Go isn’t a perfect solution for every problem. Here are some of the downsides of the language:

- **Binary Size**: When you compile a binary in Go, the resulting file is often several megabytes in size. While you can reduce the size by stripping debugging symbols and using a packer, these steps require additional effort. This can be a drawback, especially for security practitioners who need to attach binaries to emails, host them on shared filesystems, or transfer them over a network.

- **Verbosity**: Although Go is less verbose than languages like C#, Java, or even C/C++, its simplistic language constructs can sometimes force you to be overly expressive. For example, tasks that might be a one-liner in Python, such as handling lists (called slices in Go), processing, looping, or error handling, can become three or more lines in Go.

### Chapter Overview

The first chapter of this book provides a basic overview of Go’s syntax and philosophy. Subsequent chapters delve into practical examples for tool development, including common network protocols like HTTP, DNS, and SMB. We then explore various tactics and problems encountered in penetration testing, such as data pilfering, packet sniffing, and exploit development. Finally, we discuss how to create dynamic, pluggable tools, followed by topics on cryptography, attacking Microsoft Windows, and implementing steganography.

Throughout the book, there will be opportunities to extend the provided tools to meet your specific objectives. While we provide robust examples, our primary goal is to equip you with the knowledge and foundation to adapt or rework these examples to suit your needs. Our aim is to teach you how to "fish."

### Setting Up Your Go Development Environment

This chapter guides you through setting up your Go development environment and introduces you to the language’s syntax. It covers the most basic concepts needed to work through the code examples in the following chapters, from primitive data types to implementing concurrency.

#### Downloading and Installing Go

1. **Download the Go Binary:**
   - Visit https://golang.org/dl/ and download the Go binary release appropriate for your operating system and architecture.
   - Execute the binary and follow the prompts to install the core packages.

2. **Set GOROOT:**
   - Define the GOROOT environment variable to point to the location of your Go installation.
   - On Linux or macOS, add `export GOROOT=/path/to/go` to your `~/.profile`.
   - On Windows, set the GOROOT environment variable through the System (Control Panel).

3. **Set GOPATH:**
   - Define the GOPATH environment variable to specify the location of your Go workspace.
   - Create the `bin`, `pkg`, and `src` subdirectories within your base workspace directory.
   - Set GOPATH to point to your base workspace directory, e.g., `GOPATH=$HOME/gocode`.

4. **Verify Installation:**
   - Use the `go version` command to confirm that Go is installed correctly.

#### Choosing an Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

- **Vim Editor:**
  - A versatile, extensible, and open-source text editor.
  - Install the `vim-go` plugin for Go support.
  - Requires some customization but offers a powerful terminal-based development environment.

- **GitHub Atom:**
  - A hackable text editor with a large community-driven package ecosystem.
  - Provides a dedicated IDE application with features like tiling, package management, and version control.
  - Use the `go-plus` plugin for Go support.

- **Microsoft Visual Studio Code (VS Code):**
  - A feature-rich and easy-to-configure IDE.
  - Open source and distributed under an MIT license.
  - Supports a wide range of extensions for themes, versioning, code completion, and more.
  - Use the `vscode-go` extension for Go integration.

- **JetBrains GoLand:**
  - A commercial IDE dedicated to the Go language.
  - Offers all the expected features of a rich IDE, including debugging, code completion, and version control.
  - Pricing ranges from free for students to $199 annually for organizations.

#### Using Common Go Tool Commands

- **go run:**
  - Compiles and executes the main package.
  - Example: `go run main.go` to print "Hello, Black Hat Gophers!"

- **go build:**
  - Compiles your application and creates a binary file on disk.
  - Example: `go build hello.go` to create an executable named `hello`.

By following these steps, you will have a functional Go development environment ready for the exercises and projects in the following chapters.
