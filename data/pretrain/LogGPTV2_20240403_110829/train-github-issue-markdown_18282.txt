After upgrading to styled-components 5.0.1 from 4.1.9, we're getting these
errors.
    TS2589: Type instantiation is excessively deep and possibly infinite.
  * I tried using the `@types/styled-components` package and had problems.
  * I tried using the latest stable version of tsc. https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript
  * I have a question that is inappropriate for StackOverflow. (Please ask any appropriate questions there).
  * Mention the authors (see `Definitions by:` in `index.d.ts`) so they can respond.

Here's a playground link that **_DOESN'T_** show the error, but this error in
an actual project will definitely show. In our case, in many multiple files.
Everything was fine before the update.
The error shows on `text={text} {...rest} role="separator"` and disappears
when removing `{...rest}`.
All is well if I don't upgrade this package, even when I _do_ upgrade styled-
components itself.
It might help to know as well that we're on Typescript 3.8.3. Perhaps a newer
typescript is stricter in some magical way, although I seriously doubt they'd
introduce such impressively strange breaking changes.
