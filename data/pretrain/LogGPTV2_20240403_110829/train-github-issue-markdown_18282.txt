After upgrading from styled-components 4.1.9 to 5.0.1, we encountered the following error:

```
TS2589: Type instantiation is excessively deep and possibly infinite.
```

### Steps Taken:
- I tried using the `@types/styled-components` package, but it did not resolve the issue.
- I updated to the latest stable version of TypeScript (as listed on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript)).
- The problem persists in our project, but it does not appear in a playground environment. Here's a [playground link](#) that **does not** show the error, even though it occurs in multiple files in our actual project.

### Error Details:
- The error appears when using the following code: `text={text} {...rest} role="separator"`.
- Removing `{...rest}` resolves the error.
- The issue only arises after upgrading the `styled-components` package. If I do not upgrade this package, everything works fine, even with the upgraded `styled-components`.

### Additional Information:
- We are currently using TypeScript 3.8.3.
- It is possible that a newer version of TypeScript might be stricter, but it seems unlikely that such a significant breaking change would be introduced.
