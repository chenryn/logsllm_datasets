Data models are perhaps the most important part of developing software, because they have such a profound effect: not only on how the software is written, but also on how we *think about the problem* that we are solving.
Most applications are built by layering one data model on top of another. For each layer, the key question is: how is it *represented* in terms of the next-lower layer? For example:
1. As an application developer, you look at the real world (in which there are peo‐ ple, organizations, goods, actions, money flows, sensors, etc.) and model it in terms of objects or data structures, and APIs that manipulate those data struc‐ tures. Those structures are often specific to your application.
2. When you want to store those data structures, you express them in terms of a general-purpose data model, such as JSON or XML documents, tables in a rela‐ tional database, or a graph model.
3. The engineers who built your database software decided on a way of representing that JSON/XML/relational/graph data in terms of bytes in memory, on disk, or on a network. The representation may allow the data to be queried, searched, manipulated, and processed in various ways.
4. On yet lower levels, hardware engineers have figured out how to represent bytes in terms of electrical currents, pulses of light, magnetic fields, and more.
In a complex application there may be more intermediary levels, such as APIs built upon APIs, but the basic idea is still the same: each layer hides the complexity of the layers below it by providing a clean data model. These abstractions allow different groups of people—for example, the engineers at the database vendor and the applica‐ tion developers using their database—to work together effectively.
There are many different kinds of data models, and every data model embodies assumptions about how it is going to be used. Some kinds of usage are easy and some are not supported; some operations are fast and some perform badly; some data transformations feel natural and some are awkward.
It can take a lot of effort to master just one data model (think how many books there are on relational data modeling). Building software is hard enough, even when work‐ ing with just one data model and without worrying about its inner workings. But since the data model has such a profound effect on what the software above it can and can’t do, it’s important to choose one that is appropriate to the application.
In this chapter we will look at a range of general-purpose data models for data stor‐ age and querying (point 2 in the preceding list). In particular, we will compare the relational model, the document model, and a few graph-based data models. We will also look at various query languages and compare their use cases. In [Chapter 3](ch3.md) we will discuss how storage engines work; that is, how these data models are actually implemented (point 3 in the list).

## Summary
Data models are a huge subject, and in this chapter we have taken a quick look at a broad variety of different models. We didn’t have space to go into all the details of each model, but hopefully the overview has been enough to whet your appetite to find out more about the model that best fits your application’s requirements.
Historically, data started out being represented as one big tree (the hierarchical model), but that wasn’t good for representing many-to-many relationships, so the relational model was invented to solve that problem. More recently, developers found that some applications don’t fit well in the relational model either. New nonrelational “NoSQL” datastores have diverged in two main directions:
1. *Document databases* target use cases where data comes in self-contained docu‐ ments and relationships between one document and another are rare.
2. *Graph databases* go in the opposite direction, targeting use cases where anything is potentially related to everything.
All three models (document, relational, and graph) are widely used today, and each is good in its respective domain. One model can be emulated in terms of another model —for example, graph data can be represented in a relational database—but the result is often awkward. That’s why we have different systems for different purposes, not a single one-size-fits-all solution.
One thing that document and graph databases have in common is that they typically don’t enforce a schema for the data they store, which can make it easier to adapt applications to changing requirements. However, your application most likely still assumes that data has a certain structure; it’s just a question of whether the schema is explicit (enforced on write) or implicit (handled on read).
Each data model comes with its own query language or framework, and we discussed several examples: SQL, MapReduce, MongoDB’s aggregation pipeline, Cypher, SPARQL, and Datalog. We also touched on CSS and XSL/XPath, which aren’t data‐ base query languages but have interesting parallels.
Although we have covered a lot of ground, there are still many data models left unmentioned. To give just a few brief examples:
* Researchers working with genome data often need to perform *sequence- similarity searches*, which means taking one very long string (representing a DNA molecule) and matching it against a large database of strings that are simi‐ lar, but not identical. None of the databases described here can handle this kind of usage, which is why researchers have written specialized genome database software like GenBank [48].
- Particle physicists have been doing Big Data–style large-scale data analysis for decades, and projects like the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) now work with hun‐ dreds of petabytes! At such a scale custom solutions are required to stop the hardware cost from spiraling out of control [49].
- *Full-text search* is arguably a kind of data model that is frequently used alongside databases. Information retrieval is a large specialist subject that we won’t cover in great detail in this book, but we’ll touch on search indexes in [Chapter 3](ch3.md) and [Part III](part-iii.md).
We have to leave it there for now. In the next chapter we will discuss some of the trade-offs that come into play when *implementing* the data models described in this chapter.
