User: I try to import the PyDrive module in my PyCharm project : from pydrive.auth import GoogleAuth.
I tried different things :

Installing it directly from the project interpreter
Download it with a pip command and import it with the path for the poject interpreter
The same thing in Linux

Nothing works. Each time PyCharm recognize the module and even sugest the auto-completion, but when I run the project it keeps saying ImportError: No module named pydrive.auth
Any suggestion ?
EDIT : When I put directly the pydrive folder in my repository, and this time : ImportError: No module named httplib2 from the first import of PyDrive.
My path is correct and httplib2 is again in my PyCharm project
Assistant: After noticing that the module is already installed, both by pip and by the project interpreter, and nothing worked, this what did the trick (finaly!):

make sure the module is indeed installed:
sudo pip{2\3} install --upgrade httplib2
locate the module on your computer:
find / | grep httplib2

you will need to reach the place in which pip is installing the module, the path would probably look like this:
/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages

get into the path specified there, search for the module and copy all the relevant files and folders into your local pycharm project environment. this will be a directory with a path like this: 
/home/your_user/.virtualenvs/project_name/lib/python2.7

this is it. note however you may need to do this multiple times, since each module may have a dependencies... 
good  luck!
