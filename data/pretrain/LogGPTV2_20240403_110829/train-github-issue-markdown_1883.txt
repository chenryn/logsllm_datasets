It would be beneficial to implement auto-completion for the `command` and `when` fields in the `keybindings.json` file.

While I believe adding auto-completion for the `when` field should be relatively straightforward—since, as far as I understand, extensions cannot introduce new events—the `command` field may present a slightly greater challenge. This is because it would need to include commands from extensions, which are already registered. However, this should not be an insurmountable obstacle.

Thank you.
