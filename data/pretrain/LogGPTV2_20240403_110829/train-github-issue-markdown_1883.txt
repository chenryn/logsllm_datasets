It would be useful to have auto complete for the `command`and `when` fields in
the keybindings.json.  
I don't think this would be too hard for when as as far as I understand
extensions cannot add new events. However commands may be slightly trickier as
you would have to incorporate commands from extensions, but these are
registered anyway so hopefully would not be a show stopper.  
Thanks
