# Summary of the new feature/enhancement
As a power user I frequently open up my "Programs and Features" (or also known
as "Uninstall a program" under Control Panel) and uncommonly other Control
Panel items. If I typed in "programs" into the Run window it would provide me
with "Programs and Features" as an item and I am able to open up this window
without having to open up the Control Panel by searching for that first then
opening up the window that I want.
# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)
Thanks so much team and keep up the amazing work!
