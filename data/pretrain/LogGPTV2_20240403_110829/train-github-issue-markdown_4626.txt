### Summary of the New Feature/Enhancement

As a power user, I frequently access the "Programs and Features" (also known as "Uninstall a program") section in the Control Panel, as well as other Control Panel items. Currently, to open "Programs and Features," I need to first open the Control Panel and then navigate to the specific section. To streamline this process, I propose that typing "programs" into the Run dialog box should directly open the "Programs and Features" window. This enhancement would save time and improve efficiency by eliminating the need to open the Control Panel first.

### Proposed Technical Implementation Details (Optional)

1. **Run Dialog Box Integration**: Modify the Run dialog box to recognize the keyword "programs" and map it directly to the "Programs and Features" control panel applet.
2. **Registry or Shortcut Update**: Create a new registry entry or shortcut that associates the keyword "programs" with the "Programs and Features" executable or script.
3. **User Interface Consistency**: Ensure that the user interface remains consistent and that the direct access does not introduce any unintended side effects or conflicts with existing shortcuts.

Thank you for your consideration, and keep up the amazing work, team!
