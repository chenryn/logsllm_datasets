Sean Metcalf | @PyroTek3 | PI:EMAIL
What is Hybrid Cloud? 
•Blend of on-prem infrastructure combined with cloud 
services.
•Typically on-prem infrastructure with some cloud 
hosted infrastructure (IAAS) and services (SAAS).
•Connection points between on-prem and cloud often 
don’t focus on security.
Sean Metcalf | @PyroTek3 | PI:EMAIL
Hybrid Cloud Scenarios
•On-Prem AD with Office 365 Services (SaaS)
• Office 365 to host mailboxes with authentication 
performed by Active Directory on-prem.
•Cloud Datacenter
• Extending the datacenter to the cloud leveraging Azure 
and/or Amazon AWS (IaaS).
•On-Prem AD with Cloud Hosted AD as Resource Forest
• Trust between on-prem AD and cloud hosted AD
•Combination of these (or other)

The Cloud & 
Virtualization
Sean Metcalf | @PyroTek3 | PI:EMAIL
Conceptually The Cloud is Virtualization (effectively)
• Cloud provider Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) architecture 
and configuration
• Amazon AWS architecture to host VMs (instances) which has 
leveraged XEN and more recently (2018) Amazon’s Nitro 
(based off KVM core kernel).
• Azure leverages a customized version of Hyper-V (core) to 
host Azure VMs.
• Google Cloud Platform (GCP) uses KVM for virtualization.
• There is a cloud “fabric” that ties the “virtualization” 
component with orchestration (and storage, network, etc).

Physical DCs
• Physical Access
• Out of Band Management (HP ILO)
• Check for port 2381 on servers for ILO web service (on same 
network –which is bad)

Identified iLO
Security 
Issues:
• A new exploitation technique that allows compromise of the 
host server operating system through DMA.
• Leverage a discovered RCE to exploit an iLO4 feature which 
allows read-write access to the host memory and inject a 
payload in the host Linux kernel.
• New vulnerability in the web server to flash a new backdoored 
firmware. 
• The use of the DMA communication channel to execute 
arbitrary commands on the host system.
• iLO (4/5) CHIF channel interface opens a new attack surface, 
exposed to the host (even though iLO is set as disabled). 
Exploitation of CVE-2018-7078 could allow flashing a 
backdoored firmware from the host through this interface.
• We discovered a logic error (CVE-2018-7113) in the kernel 
code responsible for the integrity verification of the userland 
image, which can be exploited to break the chain-of-trust. 
Related to new secure boot feature introduced with iLO5 and 
HPE Gen10 server line.
• Provide a Go scanner to discover vulnerable servers running 
iLO

Virtual DCs: VMWare
• Compromise VMWare administration
• Compromise account with VMWare access to Virtual DCs 
• Compromise system running vCenter (Windows system or 
appliance) since this is an administration gateway that 
owns vSphere
• Identify VMWare ESXi Root account password and use to 
compromise ESXi hosts 
(similar to local Administrator account on Windows)
• Connect directly to virtual DCs with the VIX API 
(via VMWare Tools)
Sean Metcalf | @PyroTek3 | PI:EMAIL
Virtual DCs: Hyper-V
•Compromise members of “Hyper-V Admins” group.
•Compromise server hosting Hyper-V.
•Compromise local admin account on the Hyper-V 
server (pw may be the same as other servers)
•Compromise account with GPO modify rights to the 
OU containing Hyper-V servers.

Cloud 
Hosted/Managed Active 
Directory
& What this Means to Pentesters & Red Teams
Sean Metcalf | @PyroTek3 | PI:EMAIL
Cloud Hosted/Managed AD
• AD environment spun up per customer by cloud provider
• 100% managed AD by the cloud provider
• Customer does not get Domain Admin rights or access to Domain 
Controllers
• Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform all have a 
host Managed AD environments for customers, with some differences

AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory 
Sean Metcalf | @PyroTek3 | PI:EMAIL
AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory 
Sean Metcalf | @PyroTek3 | PI:EMAIL
AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory 
• 2 DCs running Windows Server 2012 R2 (172.31.14.175 & 
172.31.22.253)
• Default domain Administrator account “Administrator” in the 
“AWS Reserved” OU.
• First account is “Admin” and gains full rights on customer OU
• Customer OU created and rights delegated to AWS 
Administrators (& default Admin account)
• The domain password policy is default, but the customer has the 
ability to modify 5 pre-created Fine-grained password policies
• The DC auditing policy is decent except no Kerberos audit 
policies, so no way to detect Kerberoasting (requires "Audit 
Kerberos Service Ticket Operations" auditing).

AWS Managed AD – Customer Admin Account
Sean Metcalf | @PyroTek3 | PI:EMAIL
AWS Microsoft AD Delegation Groups
• AWS Delegated Administrators group is delegated most rights including:
• Group Modify rights on the "AWS Delegated Groups: OU
• "Reanimate-Tombstones" (effectively the ability to undelete objects)
• AWS Delegated Managed Service Account Administrators group is 
delegated rights to create and manage MSAs
• AWS Delegated Add Workstations To Domain Users added to the "Add 
workstations to domain" URA on DC GPO
• AWS Delegated Kerberos Delegation Administrators added to "Enable 
computer and user accounts to be trusted for delegation" 
• AWS Delegated Replicate Directory Changes Administrators group is 
delegated "DS-Replication-Get-Changes" at the domain level
• AWS Delegated Domain Name System Administrators is added to the 
DNSAdmins group providing DNS administration.
• AWS Delegated Server Administrators group is added to the local 
Administrators on all computers in the customer OU ("LAB") and child 
OUs via the GPO "ServerAdmins".

• Default domain Administrator account “dcaasadmin” (default location)
• Initial admin account is Azure AD account – can select Azure AD accounts 
(or synched on-prem AD accounts)
• Customer OUs: AADDC Computers & AADDC Users
• 1 Fine-Grained Password Policy (FGPP) called “AADDSSTFPSO”
• Authenticated Users can add computers to the domain
• Event auditing on Managed AD Domain Controllers not configured via 
GPO, so can’t see configuration.
Sean Metcalf | @PyroTek3 | PI:EMAIL
Azure AD DS Delegation Groups
• AAD DC Administrators has the ability to create new OUs (domain)
• AAD DC Administrators is delegated Full Control on:
• AADDC Computers
• AADDSSyncEscrows
• AADDSSyncState
• Managed Service Accounts
• Program Data
• AAD DC Administrators has Edit Settings rights on the GPOs:
• AADDC Computers GPO (linked to OU=AADDC 
Computers,DC=trimarcrd,DC=com)
• AADDC Users GPO (linked to OU=AADDC Users,DC=trimarcrd,DC=com)
• The GPO AADDC Computers GPO adds AAD DC Administrators to the 
local group Administrators in the following OU AADDC Computers

GCP Managed Microsoft AD
Sean Metcalf | @PyroTek3 | PI:EMAIL
GCP Managed Microsoft AD
• 2 DCs running Windows Server 2019 Datacenter (2012R2 Forest FL)
• The AD Recycle Bin has not been enabled
• Default domain Administrator account “Administrator” (disabled)
• 2nd domain admin account “cloudsvcadmin”
• First account is customer created (“setupadmin” –can be changed)
• The domain password policy is default, but the customer has the 
ability to create Fine-grained password policies
• Event auditing on Managed AD Domain Controllers not configured 
via GPO, so can’t see configuration.
Sean Metcalf | @PyroTek3 | PI:EMAIL
GCP Managed AD Delegation Groups
• Cloud Service All Administrators
• Delegated Full Control on all objects (& link GPO rights) in the Cloud OU
• Cloud Service Administrators
• Member of Cloud Service All Administrators & Group Policy Creator Owners
• Cloud Service Computer Administrators
• Added to local Administrators group via GPO on Cloud OU

Sean Metcalf | @PyroTek3 | PI:EMAIL
Managed AD Common Themes
• No customer Domain Admin or Domain Controller rights.
• Custom OU(s) are provided for customer use (users, computers, groups, 
etc.).
• Delegation groups provides AD component management capability to 
customer.
• Domain Password Policy is default (7 characters), with the ability to adjust 
via Fine-Grained Password Policies.
• Azure AD DS & GCP Managed AD both seem to have default Domain 
Controller GPO settings.
• All provide the ability to configure an AD trust, so you may see the on-prem 
AD forest trust a Managed AD environment (in the near future).
• Slightly different (or quite different!) approaches are used to provide the 
same or similar capability.

AD Security Review PowerShell Script: https://trimarc.co/ADCheckScript
Attacking Managed AD
• Determine which Managed AD you are viewing (combination of OU and 
group names)
• Likely no escalation to Domain Admins, so focus on delegation groups & 
membership
• Identify default customer admin account.
• Azure AD DS can be managed by Azure AD accounts that are synchronized 
into Azure AD DS or even on-prem AD accounts synched in from the on-
prem Azure AD Connect (through Azure AD) to Azure AD DS. If Password 
Hash Sync (PHS) is enabled, then the on-prem AD account hash is included.
• Enumerate Managed AD privileged group membership.
• Managed AD typically used & managed by Application Owners who may not 
realize the rights they do have as members in the Managed AD delegation 
groups.
• DC auditing may not be configured to detect malicious activity (or sent to 
SIEM)
