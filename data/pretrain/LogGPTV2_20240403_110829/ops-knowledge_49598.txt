User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Does plaintext reach protonmail server? I am quite happy with, indeed grateful for, protonmail.  There is one point I'd like to understand better regarding end-to-end encryption.  I asked this twice at protonmail.com, and twice it was removed by the moderator. I hope someone here can answer.

I infer that an outgoing message is transmitted via https to the protonmail server where it is pgp-encrypted and the plaintext discarded; the reverse for incoming messages. Is this basically correct?

If so, then "end-to-end encryption" doesn't mean quite what I thought, and I would like to know a little more about how the plaintext is handled by the server.

I don't distrust protonmail.  I understand that if I felt the need I could  download public and private keys and encrypt locally, but then I might as well use gmail.

Assistant: Server never receives plain text, which is very easy to verify. Log int to your protonmail and observe all communication which browser does with server.
at some stage you will see message like that

If you look at section Body you will noticed it is encrypted using PGP before send to server. 

Yes, if you have keys, then you could decrypt this message on your own. 

Using Gmail instead proton mail will not give you key benefit which proton mail does. This message is passed to back end encrypted which indicates, it will be stored in drafts as encrypted, which won't necessary happened in case of Gmail.
