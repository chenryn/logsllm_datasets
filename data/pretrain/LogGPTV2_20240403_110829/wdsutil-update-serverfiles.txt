### Update-ServerFiles

The `Update-ServerFiles` command updates the files in the REMINST shared folder using the latest files stored in the server's `%Windir%\System32\RemInst` directory. To maintain the integrity of your Windows Deployment Services (WDS) installation, it is recommended to run this command after each server upgrade, service pack installation, or update to WDS files.

#### Syntax
```shell
wdsutil [Options] /Update-ServerFiles [/Server:<ServerName>]
```

#### Parameters

- **/Server:**  
  Specifies the name of the server. This can be either the NetBIOS name or the fully qualified domain name (FQDN). If no server name is specified, the local server will be used.

#### Examples

To update the files, you can use one of the following commands:

1. Update the files on the local server:
   ```shell
   wdsutil /Update-ServerFiles
   ```

2. Update the files on a specific server and display verbose and progress information:
   ```shell
   wdsutil /Verbose /Progress /Update-ServerFiles /Server:MyWDSServer
   ```

By running these commands, you ensure that the REMINST shared folder is synchronized with the latest files from the server's `%Windir%\System32\RemInst` directory, maintaining the consistency and reliability of your WDS environment.
