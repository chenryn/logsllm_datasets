User: Please use Elasticsearch for full-text search and analysis based on this keyword
Assistant: Complaint letters use Elasticsearch for full-text search and analysis of complaint letters, which can be divided into the following steps: 1. Create index and mapping Create an index named "complaint_letter" through the Elasticsearch API, and specify "date", "text", "company", etc. field, and set the corresponding word breaker (such as Chinese word breaker, English word breaker, etc.). The sample code is as follows: PUT /complaint_letter { "mappings": { "properties": { "date": {"type": "date"}, "text": {"type": "text", "analyzer": " ik_max_word"}, "company": {"type": "keyword"} } } } 2. Insert data Insert complaint letter data into the index through the Elasticsearch API. The sample code is as follows: POST /complaint_letter/_doc { "date": "2022-01-01", "text": "Very dissatisfied with the company's service", "company": "ABC company" } 3. Use Elasticsearch to query data The query statement queries the complaint letter data. For example, to query a complaint letter in 2022, the sample code is as follows: GET /complaint_letter/_search { "query": { "range": { "date": { "gte": "2022-01-01", "lte" : "2022-12-31" } } } } 4. Analyze the data Use Elasticsearch's aggregation function to analyze the complaint letter data. For example, to count the number of complaint letters from different companies, the sample code is as follows: GET /complaint_letter/_search { "size": 0, "aggs": { "group_by_company": { "terms": { "field": "company", "size ": 10 } } } }
