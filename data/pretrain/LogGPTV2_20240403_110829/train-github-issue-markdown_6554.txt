The release cycle for D3 Version 5 has just started with a first Release
Candidate:
  * **d3-request** will be dropped in its entirety and replaced with **d3-fetch** ,
  * **d3-contour** will be added, and
  * there is a major re-shuffle including feature deprecations between **d3-scale** and **d3-scale-chromatic** combined with the addition of **d3-scale-chromatic** to the bundle
In particular, the feature deprecation and reshuffle with regard to
**d3-scale** and **d3-scale-chromatic** (see release notes), imply that we
need to pin down the minor versions for the latest/last D3 v4 bundle
definitions.
I.e. we need to add a `package.json` stub back in, so we do not break users
running v4, before we add the new bundle definitions for D3 version 5.
@gustavderdrache and @Ledragon any comments/thoughts re preparing for D3 v5?
@andy-ms Any thoughtful guidance, how we ensure we can safely support the
migration between version 4 and version 5 definitions without breaking users
of v4?
Cheers, T
Related to #23250, #23251 and #23253.
#23252 (d3-selection 1.3) needs to be merged into the final definitions bundle
for d3: 4.13.x
