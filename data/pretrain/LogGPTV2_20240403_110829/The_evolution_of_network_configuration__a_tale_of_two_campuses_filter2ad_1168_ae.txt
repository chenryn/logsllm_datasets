patterns. Figure 12 presents the number of changes per stanza
type, for each of the top 30 switches in both networks. The switches
in UW are similar, in that most of the changes are in the inter-
face commands, with a few devices having a signiﬁcant amount
of VLAN additions. Unlike UW, GT switches have several diffe-
rent patterns. mgt accounts for a signiﬁcant amount for Device 1.
This device is a switch for the SoX (Southern Crossroads) deployed
within the Georgia Tech campus, and the changes to mgt are due
to changes to the device authentication conﬁguration, namely aaa,
radius-server, and ﬁle stanzas. This can be caused by the fact that
multiple users manage this device. There is also a group of de-
vices (devices 25–29) that have a lot of sec stanzas. Further inspec-
tion shows these devices are VPN boxes with many ipsec changes.
These devices can be classiﬁed as specialized switches that provide
unique functions of secure connection establishment between the
internal and external network.
4.4.2 Longitudinal analysis
Evolution trend is heavily inﬂuenced by how switches are
added, removed or swapped, as well as their initial conﬁgu-
ration. Figures 13a and 13d show a gradual increase in the total
number of conﬁguration lines, for both networks. The increasing
trend is mainly due to the increase in number of switch devices, as
shown in Figures 13c and 13f. An abnormal spike appears around
September 2010 in Figure 13a, when 150 new switches were added
to the GT network.
In Figure 13b, the l2 command experiences
several decreases and increases. Inspection of the switch conﬁgura-
tions reveals that around February 2006, a set of new switches with
24 ports was added to the network; older switches had more ports
and hence had more verbose conﬁguration. The other increases and
decreases are of the same nature: the trend depends on what type
of switches are added to the network with speciﬁc initial conﬁgu-
rations. This phenomenon is similar to the decreasing number of
vlan commands in Figure 13b; switches with small vlan instances
are being added to the network continuously.
Distinct practices and decisions in UW. Turning to UW, in Fig-
ures 13d and 13e, we see that in January 2008, the number of lines
for sec doubles and mgt decreases. Additions to sec commands
occurred due to changes to all interfaces on all switches to make
the network more resilient to bursty trafﬁc, by installing a limiting
mechanism. The mgt drop in Jan, 2008 is due to operators remov-
ing the SNMP feature from all interfaces. In both cases, the large
changes reﬂect updates to all switches in the network.
We ﬁnd that operational and network expansion practices of in-
dividual networks play an important role in shaping how the switch
conﬁguration evolves; understanding this evolution can facilitate
the design of better network management tools.
4.4.3 Correlation analysis
In Table 7, we examine the set of correlated stanzas for the
switches across the two campuses. Most changes in UW include
either l1 or mgt whereas most changes in GT include either vlan or
l1. However, both networks agree on a set of correlated changes:
(1) vlan and l1, (2) acl and l1, and (3) mgt and l1. As with other
devices, interface deﬁnition and VLAN conﬁguration commands
have high correlation, as do ACLs that reference certain interfaces.
l1 and mgt correlates well in switches, because many default in-
terface conﬁguration in switches have snmp trap and logging. The
UW network has an additional l2 correlation with l1 and mgt. This
is due to heavily using spanning-tree related subcommands on in-
terfaces. Although not shown, UW does in fact contain mgt and
vlan correlations; UW contains half as many correlated occurrences
of mgt and vlan. In addition to those, GT includes a unique combi-

nation sec and qos, this combination can be attributed to the usage
of VPN devices, which are unique to GT. The l1,l2, and mgt com-
binations are unique to the UW campus; similar commands change
as with the l1 and mgt combination.
On the whole, we ﬁnd signiﬁcant evidence of correlated changes
to stanzas, although the speciﬁc sets of stanzas that change de-
pend on the network in question. As such, when using correla-
tions to drive conﬁguration management (e.g., in providing guid-
ance on conﬁguration changes to install, as discussed in Section 5),
we must ﬁrst design techniques that learn the correlations prevalent
in a given network.

5. DISCUSSION
We now discuss how our observations can help augment existing
and proposed conﬁguration tools and mechanisms.
First, it may be possible to provide recommendations or sugges-
tions to the operator concerning changes, based on the previous
historical change logs. For example, we have found that l1 and
l3 stanzas change the most in routers, while l1 and vlan stanzas
changes together frequently in switches. Based on the what the
operator is changing, a system could provide feedback or possible
changes associated with currently updated stanzas. For example,
in ﬁrewalls, if there is a change in network object group deﬁni-
