### 4.4.1 Longitudinal Analysis

Figure 10 presents a longitudinal analysis of firewall configurations over five years, from January 2006 to January 2010. The analysis includes the following metrics: VLAN (vlan), Layer 3 (l3), Access Control List (acl), Management (mgt), Layer 1 (l1), Layer 2 (l2), Security (sec), Content Filtering (cflt), and Quality of Service (qos).

- **(a) All devices - GT**
- **(b) Median - GT**
- **(c) Number of devices - GT**
- **(d) All devices - UW**
- **(e) Median - UW**
- **(f) Number of devices - UW**

The figures show the number of configuration lines for each metric over time. For example, in Figure 10(c) and 10(f), there is a gradual increase in the total number of configuration lines, which is primarily due to the addition of new switch devices, as shown in Figures 10(c) and 10(f). An abnormal spike appears around September 2010 in Figure 10(a), when 150 new switches were added to the GT network.

### 4.4.2 Configuration Changes

Figure 12 presents the number of changes per stanza type for each of the top 30 switches in both networks. The patterns observed in the UW network are relatively consistent, with most changes occurring in the interface commands, and a few devices having significant VLAN additions. In contrast, the GT network shows more varied patterns. For instance, the mgt stanza accounts for a significant amount of changes in Device 1, which is a switch for the SoX (Southern Crossroads) deployed within the Georgia Tech campus. These changes are primarily due to modifications in device authentication configuration, such as AAA, RADIUS server, and file stanzas, likely due to multiple users managing the device.

Additionally, a group of devices (devices 25â€“29) in the GT network have a high number of sec stanzas. Further inspection reveals that these devices are VPN boxes with many IPsec changes, indicating they are specialized switches providing secure connection establishment between the internal and external networks.

### 4.4.3 Longitudinal Trends

The evolution trend of switch configurations is heavily influenced by how switches are added, removed, or swapped, as well as their initial configuration. Figures 13a and 13d show a gradual increase in the total number of configuration lines for both networks. This increasing trend is mainly due to the addition of new switch devices, as shown in Figures 13c and 13f. An abnormal spike appears around September 2010 in Figure 13a, when 150 new switches were added to the GT network.

In Figure 13b, the l2 command experiences several decreases and increases. Inspection of the switch configurations reveals that around February 2006, a set of new switches with 24 ports was added to the network; older switches had more ports and hence had more verbose configurations. The other increases and decreases are of the same nature: the trend depends on what type of switches are added to the network with specific initial configurations. This phenomenon is similar to the decreasing number of vlan commands in Figure 13b; switches with small VLAN instances are being continuously added to the network.

### Distinct Practices and Decisions in UW

Turning to the UW network, in Figures 13d and 13e, we see that in January 2008, the number of lines for sec doubles, and mgt decreases. Additions to sec commands occurred due to changes to all interfaces on all switches to make the network more resilient to bursty traffic by installing a limiting mechanism. The drop in mgt in January 2008 is due to operators removing the SNMP feature from all interfaces. In both cases, the large changes reflect updates to all switches in the network.

We find that operational and network expansion practices of individual networks play an important role in shaping how the switch configuration evolves. Understanding this evolution can facilitate the design of better network management tools.

### 4.4.4 Correlation Analysis

Table 7 examines the set of correlated stanzas for the switches across the two campuses. Most changes in UW include either l1 or mgt, whereas most changes in GT include either vlan or l1. However, both networks agree on a set of correlated changes: (1) vlan and l1, (2) acl and l1, and (3) mgt and l1. As with other devices, interface definition and VLAN configuration commands have high correlation, as do ACLs that reference certain interfaces. l1 and mgt correlate well in switches because many default interface configurations in switches have SNMP trap and logging. The UW network has an additional l2 correlation with l1 and mgt, due to the heavy use of spanning-tree-related subcommands on interfaces. Although not shown, UW does contain mgt and vlan correlations, but with half as many occurrences as in GT. Additionally, GT includes a unique combination of sec and qos, attributed to the usage of VPN devices, which are unique to GT. The l1, l2, and mgt combinations are unique to the UW campus, with similar commands changing as with the l1 and mgt combination.

On the whole, we find significant evidence of correlated changes to stanzas, although the specific sets of stanzas that change depend on the network in question. When using correlations to drive configuration management, it is essential to first design techniques that learn the correlations prevalent in a given network.

### 5. Discussion

Our observations can help augment existing and proposed configuration tools and mechanisms. For example, it may be possible to provide recommendations or suggestions to the operator concerning changes based on historical change logs. We have found that l1 and l3 stanzas change the most in routers, while l1 and vlan stanzas change together frequently in switches. Based on what the operator is changing, a system could provide feedback or possible changes associated with currently updated stanzas. For example, in firewalls, if there is a change in network object group definitions, the system could suggest related changes to access control lists or interface configurations.
