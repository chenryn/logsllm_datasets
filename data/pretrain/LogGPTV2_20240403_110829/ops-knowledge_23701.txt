User: Please describe the difference between HTTP and HTTPS protocols, and how HTTPS is implemented using TLS/SSL.
Assistant: The HTTP protocol is a basic protocol for transmitting web documents, while HTTPS is a protocol that uses the TLS/SSL protocol for encryption and authentication on the basis of the HTTP protocol. The data transmitted by the HTTP protocol is not encrypted and may be eavesdropped or tampered with, so it is not suitable for transmitting sensitive information, such as passwords, bank account numbers, etc. On the basis of HTTP+TLS/SSL, HTTPS uses TLS/SSL to enhance the security of data transmission, encrypts and authenticates the transmitted data, and avoids security issues such as man-in-the-middle attacks and data tampering. In actual use, when the client initiates an HTTPS request, it will first perform a security handshake with the server to negotiate an appropriate encryption method, and then the communication between the client and the server will be encrypted and decrypted using this encryption method. During the handshake process, the TLS/SSL protocol will verify the identity of the server and provide an encrypted channel for both parties to ensure the security of data transmission. To implement the HTTPS protocol, an SSL certificate needs to be installed on the server. An SSL certificate is a digital certificate issued by a trusted CA organization, which is used to verify the identity of a web server and ensure that it is running under a trusted domain name. When the client initiates an HTTPS request, the web server will send its SSL certificate to the client, the client uses the public key in the certificate to encrypt, and returns the encrypted data to the web server, and the server uses its own private key Decryption is performed to establish a secure communication link and achieve confidentiality and integrity of data transmission.
