ABSTRACT
Many existing identification approaches require active user input,
specialized sensing hardware, or personally identifiable informa-
tion such as fingerprints or face scans. In this paper, we propose
EchoLock, a low-effort identification scheme that validates the user
by sensing hand geometry via commodity microphones and speak-
ers. EchoLock can serve as a complementary verification method
for high-end devices or as a stand-alone user identification scheme
for lower-end devices without using privacy-sensitive features. In
addition to security applications, our system can also personalize
user interactions with smart devices, such as automatically adapt-
ing settings or preferences when different people are holding smart
remotes. To this end, we study the impact of hands on structure-
borne sound propagation in mobile devices and develop a user
identification scheme that can measure, quantify, and exploit dis-
tinct sound reflections in order to differentiate distinct identities.
Particularly, we propose a non-intrusive hand sensing technique to
derive unique acoustic features in both time and frequency domain,
which can effectively capture the physiological and behavioral traits
of a user’s hand (e.g., hand contours, finger sizes, holding strengths,
and holding styles). Furthermore, learning-based algorithms are
developed to robustly identify the user under various environments
and conditions. We conduct extensive experiments with 20 partic-
ipants, gathering 80,000 hand geometry samples using different
hardware setups across 160 key use case scenarios. Our results
show that EchoLock is capable of identifying users with over 94%
accuracy, without requiring any active user input.

1 INTRODUCTION
User identification is a fundamental and pervasive aspect of mod-
ern mobile device usage, both as a means of maintaining security
and personalized services. Verifying oneself is necessary to gain
access to smartphones, bank accounts, and customized news feeds;
information and resources which must be available on demand. As
such, repeated acts of authentication can grow tedious and con-
sume unnecessarily long portions of daily routines involving mobile
devices. Studies on cellphone addiction suggest that user identi-
fication procedures encompass up to 9% of daily usage time [19],
with related inquiries showing strong interest in more convenient
practices [39]. Techniques such as facial recognition or fingerprint-
ing do not require considerable effort from the user, but demand
dedicated hardware components that may not be available on all
devices. This is of particular importance for markets in developing
countries, where devices such as the Huawei IDEOS must forgo
multiple utilities in order to maintain affordable price points (e.g.
under $80) [15, 17]. Secure and effective identification necessitates
a lightweight protocol to facilitate tailored services at low cost.
To this end, we propose EchoLock, a low-effort user identification
scheme for commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) mobile devices. By al-
lowing an acoustic signal to propagate through the mobile device,
it is possible to measure properties of human hand geometry, a bio-
metric indicator known to be accurate for user identification [7], yet
rarely employed in mobile applications due to obstacles in obtaining
accurate measurements with limited hardware. We show that pres-
sure applied by a person’s hand on the device creates unique and
observable impacts on structure-borne sound propagation. By using
a designated inaudible signal, EchoLock can capture such impacts
and extract the user’s unique hand biometrics for user identification.
Our approach is low-effort as no conscious action is required by
the user; holding the device itself is the user identification action
as shown in Figure 1.
Because structure-borne sound propagation depends on material,
dimensions, and external forces , one hand does not produce the
same acoustic pattern when holding different devices. Similarly,
one device does not produce the same pattern when held by dif-
ferent hands, making our credential a secure key that represents

a specific hand-device pair. By using only readily available speak-
ers and microphones, our system is non-intrusive and low cost.
We envision that the availability of these hardware components
will only increase with the rising prevalence of integrated Inter-
net of Things (IoT) devices built with virtual assistants and voice
controllers, projected to reach an install base of over 75 billion by
2025 [1].
Existing solutions in the market are typically considered effec-
tive, but do have some limitations regarding ease of use. Actions
such as password entry, voice utterances, or finger presses demand,
however briefly, the user’s attention and active participation in
the process. In contrast, EchoLock is a passive procedure. Our tech-
nique serves as a viable standalone identification system, or as a
complementary system for multi-factor authentication due to its
naturally low involvement. Password security, for example, can be
enhanced by simultaneously sampling hand biometrics during typ-
ing or swiping actions, compensating for common vulnerabilities
(e.g. PIN codes spied on through shoulder-surfing attacks cannot
be used if the attacker’s hand is not recognized by the device).
As a standalone technique, EchoLock is applicable to a wide vari-
ety of services. Resources such as financial accounts or health apps
on smartphones can trigger a single-instance identification check
to verify the user’s hand before divulging sensitive information.
Private message notifications can be displayed or hidden onscreen
depending on which person is currently holding the device. The
integration of IoT with home security systems, such as Amazon
Blink [8], can enable even unconventional objects to be compatible
with EchoLock. For example, door handles and safety railings can be
used to passively sense structure-borne sound propagation when
held and open or lock entrances accordingly. Beyond security, appli-
ances such as smart remotes can also employ our system to enhance
the user experience. The Amazon Fire TV stick [4] is equipped with
microphones and Alexa support, making our system easy to deploy
for personalized user settings and TV channels at no additional
cost. The speed of sound propagation is rapid, even when traveling
through physical mediums, making our system latency competitive
with existing technologies. Continuous authentication can also be
implemented via periodic measurements.
Building EchoLock for such applications does present many
challenges, the most prominent being the development of a non-
intrusive approach that leverages a single pair of low-fidelity speaker
and microphone to capture unique characteristics of a user’s hand
biometrics, which usually has only minute differences between peo-
ple. In addition, the acoustic signal propagating from the device’s
speaker to its microphone usually experiences the multipath effect,
resulting in airborne and structure-borne signals that requires care-
ful separation. Moreover, the ambient noises and acoustic signals
reflected off the environment create interference that needs to be
accounted for. Finally, many factors could impact the robustness of
the proposed approach, such as device shape or material.
To address these challenges, EchoLock utilizes an ultrasonic sig-
nal to sense a user’s mannerisms when holding a device. A high-
frequency, short duration transmission is selected to reduce audible
disturbances to the user and provide prompt validation. We distin-
guish structure-borne and near-surface airborne signals based on
differing travel speeds in air and solid materials [2]. The system
applies a band-pass filter to remove ambient acoustic noises that
do not share the same spectrum as the designated ultrasonic signal.
We derive fine-grained acoustic features in the time and frequency
domains, as well as acoustic features, to capture the unique hand
biometrics. We further develop learning-based user identification
algorithms to robustly identify the user when considering various
impact factors. Our main contributions in this work are as follows:
• We study the impact of hand biometrics (i.e., hand geometry,
holding strengths and holding styles) on structure-borne
sound propagation through mobile devices and design an
acoustic sensing-based technique to measure these effects
using limited hardware in mobile devices. We show that
users’ unique physiological and behavioral hand biometrics
can be captured by using a designated acoustic signal.
• We develop a low-effort user identification system for mo-
bile devices that validates hand biometric information based
on acoustic sensing. The proposed system does not require
any input from the user and is non-intrusive by utilizing
inaudible frequencies.
• We identify unique acoustic features, including time-domain,
frequency-domain and acoustic features, to capture the user’s
hand biometrics. We also develop robust learning-based
methods to distinguish users based on their unique hand
biometrics.
• We implemented an early prototype of EchoLock on vari-
ous mobile devices and evaluated performance under mul-
tiple conditions. With over 80,000 hand geometry samples
gathered over 160 trials of key use case scenarios, we show
identification accuracy upwards of 94%.
