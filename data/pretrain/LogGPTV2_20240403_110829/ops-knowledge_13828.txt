User: Please provide a Docker-based web application deployment solution based on the following description. The web application is a Python-based Flask framework that uses a MySQL database as data storage. The application needs to run on 2 servers, one for the production environment and the other for the test environment. At the same time, in order to ensure data security, the application needs to use HTTPS for encrypted transmission. \nAsk for a solution for application deployment using Docker.
Assistant: 1. Install Docker and Docker Compose on both servers. 2. Create a Docker image, package the Flask application and related dependencies, and install the MySQL client in the image. 3. Create a Docker Compose file, which can specify different environment variables in the production and test environments. 4. In a production environment, using Nginx for reverse proxy and HTTPS encryption, you can put the SSL certificate in the Nginx container and forward the request to the container running the Flask application. 5. In the test environment, you can use the default Flask built-in server, because the test environment does not require HTTPS encryption, nor does it require reverse proxy. 6. Use Docker Compose for application deployment, which can be accessed through the service name defined in the Docker Compose file, and at the same time ensure that the application version and configuration on the two servers are consistent, which is convenient for management and maintenance. Summary: Using Docker for application deployment can easily and quickly deploy applications, and it can also ensure the consistency of application versions and configurations. In this solution, we use Docker Compose and Nginx to implement the deployment of Flask applications on two servers, and use HTTPS for encrypted transmission to ensure data security.
