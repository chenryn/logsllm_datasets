Subject: Avast Detects Atom as a Virus and Blocks It

Dear Support Team,

After the latest update, Avast has flagged Atom as a virus and is blocking it. I have attempted to resolve this issue by uninstalling and reinstalling Atom, but Avast continues to block the application.

Could you please advise on how to address this problem? For your reference, I have attached a screenshot below.

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,  
[Your Name]
