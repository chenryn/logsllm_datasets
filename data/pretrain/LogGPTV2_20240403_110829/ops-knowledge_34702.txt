Question: Why are non-executable pages not considered a robust defense against attackers using Return-oriented programming (ROP)?
"A": "ROP allows the execution of arbitrary code by using existing executable code snippets, thus bypassing the need for writable and executable pages.",
"B": "Non-executable pages are easily made executable by standard user programs, rendering such defenses ineffective against any form of attack.",
"C": "The size of the code base and the number of imported libraries have no impact on the effectiveness of ROP, which requires only a small and constant set of gadgets.",
"D": "ROP compilers are not widely available, making it difficult for attackers to generate the necessary return addresses to exploit vulnerabilities."
Answer: A
