### Environment
- **Python Version:** 2.6
- **SciPy Version:** 0.8.0.dev5530

### Issue Description
When running the `scipy.test()` command, several errors occur in the `test_vq.py` file related to the `kmeans2` function. The errors are as follows:

#### Error 1: Testing that kmeans2 init methods work
```python
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/nwagner/local/lib64/python2.6/site-packages/scipy/cluster/tests/test_vq.py", line 147, in test_kmeans2_init
    data = data.reshape((200, 2))
ValueError: total size of new array must be unchanged
```

#### Error 2: Testing simple call to kmeans2 with rank 1 data
```python
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/nwagner/local/lib64/python2.6/site-packages/scipy/cluster/tests/test_vq.py", line 127, in test_kmeans2_rank1
    data = data.reshape((200, 2))
ValueError: total size of new array must be unchanged
```

#### Error 3: Testing simple call to kmeans2 with rank 1 data
```python
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/nwagner/local/lib64/python2.6/site-packages/scipy/cluster/tests/test_vq.py", line 139, in test_kmeans2_rank1_2
    data = data.reshape((200, 2))
ValueError: total size of new array must be unchanged
```

#### Error 4: This will cause kmeans to have a cluster with no points
```python
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/nwagner/local/lib64/python2.6/site-packages/scipy/cluster/tests/test_vq.py", line 96, in test_kmeans_lost_cluster
    data = data.reshape((200, 2))
ValueError: total size of new array must be unchanged
```

### Summary
All the errors reported above indicate that the `data` array cannot be reshaped to the specified dimensions (200, 2) because the total size of the new array would be different from the original array. This suggests that the input data provided to these tests may not have the expected shape or size.

### Next Steps
- Verify the shape and size of the `data` array before attempting to reshape it.
- Ensure that the test data is correctly generated and matches the expected dimensions.
- Investigate if there are any issues with the data generation process in the test cases.

If you need further assistance, please provide additional details about the test data and the context in which these errors occur.
