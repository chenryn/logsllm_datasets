# SSLstrip â€“ Hijacking HTTPS Sessions

## Introduction
This document provides a step-by-step guide to using SSLstrip, a tool that can be used to hijack HTTPS sessions and convert them into insecure HTTP sessions. The process involves setting up an attacker machine and a target machine, configuring the necessary settings, and executing the attack.

## What You Need for This Project
- A computer running Linux (Ubuntu 8.04) to act as the Attacker.
- A second computer running any OS (e.g., Windows 7) to act as the Target.

## Goal
The objective is to have the Attacker machine serve as a proxy, converting secure HTTPS sessions to insecure HTTP sessions without the user's knowledge.

## Starting the Target Machine
1. **Start the Target Machine:**
   - Power on your Target machine.
   - Open a web browser and ensure you can connect to the Internet.

2. **Access Facebook on the Target Machine:**
   - In Firefox on the Target machine, go to `facebook.com`.
   - Observe that the URL starts with `http` instead of `https`, indicating an insecure connection.
   - Click `View` > `Page Source`.
   - In the "Source of http://www.facebook.com" window, click `Edit` > `Find`.
   - In the Find box, type `login` and click `Next`.
   - Note the form statement for the login form. Although the page is not secure, the actual login method uses a URL starting with `https`. This mixed content is the vulnerability we will exploit.

## Starting the Attacker Machine
1. **Start the Attacker Machine:**
   - Boot up an Ubuntu 8.04 virtual machine to serve as the Attacker.
   - Open a web browser and ensure you can connect to the Internet.

2. **Download SSLstrip:**
   - On the Attacker machine, open Firefox and go to `thoughtcrime.org`.
   - Click `Software` and then `sslstrip`.
   - In the Download section, click `sslstrip` to download version 0.2.
   - Save the file to the desktop.
   - Right-click the `sslstrip-0.2.tar.gz` file and select `Extract Here`.
   - Double-click the `sslstrip-0.2` folder to open it.
   - Right-click `README` and select `Open`. Read the instructions for a quick summary of the steps.
   - Close the README window.

3. **Enable IP Forwarding on the Attacker Machine:**
   - Open a Terminal window and type:
     ```bash
     sudo pico /etc/sysctl.conf
     ```
   - Enter your password when prompted.
   - Scroll down and find the line that says `#Uncomment the next line to enable packet forwarding for IPv4`.
   - Remove the `#` at the start of the next line.
   - Press `Ctrl+X`, then `Y`, and `Enter` to save the file.

4. **Set iptables to Redirect HTTP Requests:**
   - In the Terminal window, type:
     ```bash
     sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --destination-port 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8080
     ```
   - Verify the rule by typing:
     ```bash
     sudo iptables -t nat -L
     ```
   - You should see one rule in the `PREROUTING` chain. If there are any mistakes, delete the rule with:
     ```bash
     sudo iptables -t nat -D PREROUTING 1
     ```
   - Re-create the rule without errors.

5. **Start SSLstrip:**
   - In the Terminal window, navigate to the SSLstrip directory:
     ```bash
     cd ~/Desktop/sslstrip-0.2
     ```
   - View the help message by typing:
     ```bash
     sudo python sslstrip.py -h
     ```
   - Start SSLstrip with:
     ```bash
     sudo python sslstrip.py -l 8080
     ```

6. **Find the Attacker Machine's IP Address:**
   - In the Terminal window, type:
     ```bash
     ifconfig
     ```
   - Write down the IP address of the Attacker machine.

## Setting Up the Target Machine to Use a Proxy Server
1. **Configure Firefox to Use a Proxy:**
   - On the Target machine, open Firefox.
   - Go to `Tools` > `Options`.
   - Click the `Advanced` button, then the `Network` tab, and finally the `Settings...` button.
   - Select `Manual proxy configuration`.
   - Set the `HTTP Proxy` to the Attacker's IP address and the `Port` to `8080`.
   - Check the `Use this proxy server for all protocols` box.
   - Click `OK` to close the `Connection Settings` box and `OK` again to close the `Options` box.

2. **Access Facebook on the Target Machine Again:**
   - In Firefox on the Target machine, go to `facebook.com`.
   - Click `View` > `Page Source`.
   - In the "Source of http://www.facebook.com" window, click `Edit` > `Find`.
   - In the Find box, type `login` and click `Next`.
   - Notice that the form statement now uses `http` instead of `https`, demonstrating the success of SSLstrip.
   - Log in with the following credentials:
     - Username: `PI:EMAIL`
     - Password: `P@ssw0rd`
   - Click the `Login` button.

## Viewing the Captured Traffic
1. **Check the Captured Traffic:**
   - On the Attacker machine, open a new Terminal window and type:
     ```bash
     pico ~/Desktop/sslstrip-0.2/sslstrip.log
     ```
   - To find the captured password, press `Ctrl+W` and type `cnit`, then press `Enter`.

## Returning Firefox to Normal Function
1. **Reset Firefox Proxy Settings:**
   - On the Target machine, open Firefox and go to `Tools` > `Options`.
   - Click the `Advanced` button, then the `Network` tab, and the `Settings...` button.
   - Select `Direct connection to the Internet`.
   - Click `OK` to close the `Connection Settings` box and `OK` again to close the `Options` box.

## Conclusion
This guide has demonstrated how to use SSLstrip to hijack HTTPS sessions and convert them to HTTP. By following these steps, you can understand the vulnerabilities in mixed content and the importance of secure connections.
