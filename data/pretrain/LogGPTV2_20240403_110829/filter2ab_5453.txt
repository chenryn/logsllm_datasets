**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Proxysvc

**Description:**
Proxysvc is a technique that involves executing a binary on the system and logging the results to a temporary file. The command used for this operation is:
```cmd
cmd.exe /c " > %temp%\PM*.tmp 2>&1"
```
This command redirects both standard output and standard error to a temporary file in the `%temp%` directory, with a filename pattern of `PM*.tmp`.
