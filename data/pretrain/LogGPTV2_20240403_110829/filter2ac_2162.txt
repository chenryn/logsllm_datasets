title:botconf2020 Honeypot + graph learning + reasoning = scale up your emerging threat analysis
You must see thousands of new threats hitting your honeypot, what would you do next? Buying more coffee for the security research team so they can keep analyzing more? At Alibaba Cloud, we have the same flood of emerging new threats in our honeypot and we want to present our work to scale up the new threat analysis, with our honeypot system, the graph learning algorithm and the reasoning framework, surely, the most important, human in the loop!The real-life problem comes after having a large honeypot system. We see new bots in the honeypot every hour, and they also try their best to fool our honeypot. Alibaba Cloud security teamâ€™s honeypot supports ssh, telnet, and HTTP protocols, that allows us to catch attacks on different levels. However, with new attacks vectors, it might be difficult to track existing malicious comparing. An attacker can easily change the hash value of binaries, structure of a payload, or adopt new vulnerabilities to attack with the same set of TTP (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures). To make it worse, such changes are happening every hour.
