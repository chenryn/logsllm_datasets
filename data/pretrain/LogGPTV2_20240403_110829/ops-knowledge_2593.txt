User: Jupyter data path on my laptop includes unicode characters because my name has specific letters (\u00d6 and \u00fc) which are not available in plain Latin. I tried to change data path by changing JUPYTER_PATH variable but according to documentation it must include %APPDATA% variable and unfortunately %APPDATA% also includes the same letters. Is there any way to solve this problem ?
Assistant: Well setting IPYTHONDIR variable to another location rather than the default one which also includes unicode characters, solved the problem, it is not an elegant solution in fact but it works.
