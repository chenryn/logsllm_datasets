functionality-events
The BlackListNotifier class which implements the interface ApplicationListener
is registered as a subscriber to the application context and will receive the
BlackListEvent. In order to access properties specific to BlackListEvent, the
listener must perform a downcast.
This is not true because of the java generic.  
You simply have to write BlackListNotifier implements
ApplicationListener
