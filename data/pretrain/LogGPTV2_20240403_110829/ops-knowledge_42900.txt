User:  How to implement failover and load balancing to protect a web application?
Assistant: To implement failover and load balancing to protect a web application, the following methods can be used: 1. Use a load balancer: distribute requests to multiple web servers, reduce the pressure on a single server, and improve concurrency and response time. If one of the servers goes down, requests are automatically diverted to other healthy servers. 2. Static content cache: save static content in the cache, reduce the burden on the web server and improve access speed; 3. Database cluster: deploy the database on multiple nodes to ensure high availability and fault tolerance of data. 4. Backup and recovery: Regular backup of the Web server and database server, once a failure occurs, can quickly restore the operation. 5. Network topology: Multiple data centers are used to establish an active and standby network topology to ensure high availability of applications. If the primary data center fails, the application can be quickly switched to the backup data center. 6. Monitoring and early warning: Use monitoring tools to monitor the performance of the system, and send early warning notifications in time when the system is abnormal, so that administrators can handle it in a timely manner.
