under 18 could participate with verbal assent and approval
from their parents and guardians. We had approval to collect
incidental data via the smart home on children who declined
to participate or were too young to actively participate.
During the study, we experienced a security breach due to
a ﬁrewall and database misconﬁguration, resulting in the pos-
sible exposure of hashed passwords, log data, and temporary
access tokens. Based on access patterns, we believe the data
was accessed by port scanners, and not by targeted attackers.
We remediated the issue within 24 hours of discovery. We
notiﬁed our institution’s human subjects board, and contacted
participants with a description of the issue, protective steps
like changing matching passwords on other sites, and the
option to opt out of the study. No participants opted out.
Analysis. We transcribed and analyzed 633 minutes of con-
tent from the 14 initial and exit interviews. We analyzed the
interviews using a collaborative qualitative coding technique.
First, two researchers read over all of the data and developed
a codebook, using descriptive codes like “access control: use
cases”, “relationship: guests”, “notiﬁcations: too noisy”, and
“access control: trust/respect” (see Appendix C for a full list).
Two researchers independently coded two interviews, and
then met to resolve differences and clarify ambiguities in the
codebook. Then, one researcher coded the remaining inter-
views based on our revised understanding of the codes. We
used a custom code aggregation tool to help identify patterns
and extract higher level themes across interviews.

6.1 Desired Access Control Use Cases
We begin by exploring the situations where participants
wanted multi-user access controls, and what form of access
control mechanisms participants wanted. In some cases, our
prototype was able to fulﬁll participants’ goals, and in others,
the ability to explore concrete access control features in the
context of their own home evoked hypothetical policies that
they felt would better suit their needs.
Location Restrictions for Visitors. H1A wanted an access
control setting that would allow visitors like guests and do-
mestic workers to be able to access and control the devices in
her home, but only while they were physically present.
I don’t want the nanny, who’s here all day — I trust
her, obviously, or she wouldn’t be with my kids —
but at the same time, like I don’t necessarily need
her to be at her house, being able to control the
lights at my house. ...if I have guests coming into
my house, I’d like them to control automations, but...
I certainly don’t want them having admin control.
I’d prefer to have them to have geofenced control.
(H1A-Initial)
At the time, our prototype’s location-based access controls
did not quite meet her requirements, because it could only
be applied as a blanket policy for all users of a given device.
Based on this feedback, we updated the prototype to support
location-based access controls both per-user and per-device.
Preventing Conﬁguration Changes. Some participants
were concerned about other family members accidentally
making changes to access control policies, automations, or
device conﬁguration. H1A recalled when they set up their
smart home, H1B (her spouse) caused confusion by acciden-
tally pairing some devices multiple times. As a result, H1A
set H1B at the child privilege level in our prototype, which
prevented him from conﬁguring access controls and rooms.
H8A did not want her children to either change or override
the existing automation for the porch light, which turned the
lights on automatically at night for security purposes, nor did
she want them to be able to change access control policies.
As a result H8C/D were set at the child privilege level in our
app (and were also not added to the native SmartThings app,
from which the automations were created).
Parental Controls for Device Usage. Parents in our partici-
pant sample expressed interest in placing restrictions on chil-
dren to prevent mischief or other undesired uses of devices.
For example, H1A and H8A wanted to restrict their children
from turning on/off security cameras. However, participants
did not use our prototype’s features for restricting access to
any devices in practice, for reasons we discuss below.
A parental control goal that we did not anticipate was that
H1A and H8A were more interested in using the smart home
to regulate screen time, e.g. blocking internet access at certain
times, and using a smart power outlet to turn off the TV.
Devices in Private Rooms. The roommates of H3 placed
smart light bulbs each of their bedrooms, and set an access
control policy so that only the room’s owner could control the
lights. They reported that it was “comforting” and a “good
166    28th USENIX Security Symposium
USENIX Association
feature to have” (H3C), but that in practice, they never en-
countered the access controls because they were respectful of
each other and did not ever attempt to control another person’s
lights. (We discuss similar cases of social norms obviating
the use of technical access controls below.)
Preventing Remote Access for Media Devices. H4A/B ex-
pressed interest in location-based access controls for their
Amazon Echo, based on past experiences where one of them
accidentally changed the audio that was playing from outside
of the room or house, due to confusion over whose Bluetooth
device or Spotify account was playing. We did not see simi-
lar interest in location-based access controls for other device
types — perhaps because unlike lights or locks, which are
useful to remotely control for security and energy saving pur-
poses, media devices are only useful to the people physically
in the room.
Access Controls for Voice-Controlled Devices. H8A be-
came aware that their Amazon Echo could be used to bypass
the access controls and authentication of our prototype (see
Section 7.3 for more detail). In one instance, she used this
to allow her mother-in-law to access the smart home without
installing our prototype. However, she also wanted the Echo
to authenticate users by voice, so that they could use access
control policies for to their youngest son, who was too young
to have a phone but could control devices via the Echo.
6.2 Reasons for Not Using Access Controls
Based on ﬁndings about multi-user smart home tensions in
prior works, we expected that households would use our ac-
cess controls, for at least some of the potential use cases
outlined in our design principles (Section 4.1). However, in
general, we found that the access controls we implemented
did not ﬁt with the participants needs and use cases.
We analyzed participants’ usage logs, and found that while
most households experimented with using access control poli-
cies in the ﬁrst few days after the initial interview, most of
them quickly settled on the least restrictive access control
setting, not continuing to use location-based, role-based, or
supervisory access controls to restrict access to devices. The
only household that kept any access controls enabled was H3,
a household of roommates who enabled per-device role-based
access controls on the lights in their private bedrooms. How-
ever, none of the roommates ever attempted to violate these
access controls (i.e., tried to turn on or off each others’ lights).
Given this limited long-term use of access control features
in practice, we thus focus on our qualitative interview data, to
dig into the reasons why participants did not use the access
controls more than they did. Our ﬁndings surface several
reasons that are more fundamental than simply reactions to
our speciﬁc implementation — i.e., reasons that participants
may not have used any access controls, regardless of design.
Social Norms, Trust, and Respect. The most common rea-
son participants cited for not setting access controls was trust-
ing each other enough that they were not concerned about de-
vice misuse, relying instead on established household and in-
terpersonal norms. We observed such trust and norms among
relatively equal relationships, like partners and spouses:
No, we didn’t turn [remote control restrictions] on
either... We both wanted full permissions to do any-
thing whenever, we weren’t worried about the other.
I had no concern that H2B, from not nearby, would
turn off the lights. (H2A-Exit)
We also observed trust and norms among roommates:
I think we’re all pretty respectful and we wouldn’t
turn on and off each others’ lights. (H7A-Exit)
And even with children:
If [H6C] were a different kid, I would probably
leave [remote control] turned off for him. But for
him, it would be useful, I would turn it on for him.
...I think it’s going to be very speciﬁc to who is
using it, and having the option is important, but he’s
just very responsible, so it could’ve been handy for
him to be able to do something from school, like
turn on and off lights. (H6A-Initial)
Participants mentioned similar social norms about multi-
user privacy. For example, H1A and H8A/B were aware that
it was possible to eavesdrop using devices like the Amazon
Echo or security cameras, but chose not to do so.
Interference with Other Functionality. Particularly with
location-based access controls, participants often felt that the
available access controls were too restrictive and prevented
them from accomplishing other goals. In our initial design,
we expected that location-based access controls could serve a
number of goals, like access control for guests, or preventing
mischief or inconsiderate use of remote controls. However,
multiple participants wanted unfettered remote control access,
particularly for lights, because it was convenient.
I think a big thing for us was in case we forgot to
turn off the lights or something, that was like the
appeal, to turn it off remotely. (H7A-Exit)
Like the times when we would both need access to
turn off the light we forgot to turn on, were more
frequent than any need to restrict us from being
able to remotely control it. (H4B-Exit)
In other words, at least for the smart devices our participants
had, the convenience for all members of the household to
be able to exercise remote control outweighed any concerns
about intentional or accidental remote misuse.
Lack of Concern About Devices. Participants did not feel
concerned enough to use access controls for certain types of
devices, or for devices in certain locations. For example, par-
ticipants did not feel that smart lights were sensitive enough
for access control (but did want restrictions on more sensitive
devices, such as cameras, for guests and children).

We cannot say whether participants would have used more
access controls for more sensitive devices — since we allowed
our participants to select their own devices, their a priori
threat models likely inﬂuenced their devices selection (i.e., se-
lecting devices they were comfortable having in their home).
We discuss this issue further in Section 7. Moreover, we note
that these limited multi-user concerns were consistent with
participants’ overall smart home related threat models (likely
due to self-selection bias). Though some participants were
aware of potential risks such as password compromise, vulner-
abilities in wireless protocols, data collection by companies,
or lost phones, they did not consider these risks to overwhelm
the utility of the smart home.
Some participants also did not ﬁnd it necessary to control
access to devices located in household common spaces, like
