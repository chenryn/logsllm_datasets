### Participation and Data Collection

Participants under the age of 18 were allowed to join the study with verbal assent and parental or guardian approval. We also had permission to collect incidental data from the smart home devices of children who either declined to participate or were too young to actively engage in the study.

### Security Breach and Response

During the study, we experienced a security breach due to a misconfiguration in the firewall and database. This incident potentially exposed hashed passwords, log data, and temporary access tokens. Based on our analysis of access patterns, we believe the data was accessed by port scanners rather than targeted attackers. We addressed the issue within 24 hours of its discovery. We promptly notified our institutionâ€™s human subjects board and contacted all participants, providing them with a detailed description of the issue, protective steps such as changing matching passwords on other sites, and the option to opt out of the study. No participants chose to opt out.

### Data Analysis

We transcribed and analyzed 633 minutes of content from the 14 initial and exit interviews. The analysis was conducted using a collaborative qualitative coding technique. First, two researchers reviewed all the data and developed a codebook with descriptive codes such as "access control: use cases," "relationship: guests," "notifications: too noisy," and "access control: trust/respect" (see Appendix C for a full list). These researchers independently coded two interviews and then met to resolve discrepancies and clarify ambiguities in the codebook. Subsequently, one researcher coded the remaining interviews based on the revised understanding of the codes. We utilized a custom code aggregation tool to identify patterns and extract higher-level themes across the interviews.

## User Study: Results

In this section, we present the findings from our user study, including direct feedback on the features implemented in our prototype and general insights into participants' desired features and use cases, as informed by their experiences with our prototype and the smart devices in their homes.

### Desired Access Control Use Cases

#### Location Restrictions for Visitors
H1A expressed a desire for an access control setting that would allow visitors, such as guests and domestic workers, to control the devices in her home only while they were physically present. At the time, our prototype's location-based access controls did not fully meet her requirements, as it could only be applied as a blanket policy for all users of a given device. Based on this feedback, we updated the prototype to support location-based access controls both per-user and per-device.

#### Preventing Configuration Changes
Some participants were concerned about family members accidentally making changes to access control policies, automations, or device configurations. For example, H1A set H1B (her spouse) at the child privilege level in our prototype to prevent him from configuring access controls and rooms. Similarly, H8A did not want her children to change or override the existing automation for the porch light, which turned the lights on automatically at night for security purposes. As a result, H8C/D were set at the child privilege level in our app.

#### Parental Controls for Device Usage
Parents in our participant sample expressed interest in placing restrictions on children to prevent mischief or other undesired uses of devices. For instance, H1A and H8A wanted to restrict their children from turning on/off security cameras. However, participants did not use our prototype's features for restricting access to any devices in practice, for reasons discussed below. A parental control goal that we did not anticipate was the use of the smart home to regulate screen time, such as blocking internet access at certain times and using a smart power outlet to turn off the TV.

#### Devices in Private Rooms
The roommates of H3 placed smart light bulbs in each of their bedrooms and set an access control policy so that only the room's owner could control the lights. They found this feature comforting but noted that in practice, they never encountered the access controls because they respected each other's boundaries and did not attempt to control another person's lights.

#### Preventing Remote Access for Media Devices
H4A/B expressed interest in location-based access controls for their Amazon Echo, based on past experiences where one of them accidentally changed the audio that was playing from outside the room or house. We did not see similar interest in location-based access controls for other device types, possibly because media devices are only useful to the people physically in the room.

#### Access Controls for Voice-Controlled Devices
H8A became aware that their Amazon Echo could be used to bypass the access controls and authentication of our prototype. In one instance, she used this to allow her mother-in-law to access the smart home without installing our prototype. However, she also wanted the Echo to authenticate users by voice, so that they could use access control policies for their youngest son, who was too young to have a phone but could control devices via the Echo.

### Reasons for Not Using Access Controls

Based on findings from prior works, we expected households to use our access controls for various use cases. However, we found that the access controls we implemented did not align with the participants' needs and use cases.

#### Social Norms, Trust, and Respect
The most common reason participants cited for not setting access controls was trusting each other enough to not be concerned about device misuse, relying instead on established household and interpersonal norms. This trust was observed among partners, spouses, roommates, and even with children.

#### Interference with Other Functionality
Participants often felt that the available access controls, particularly location-based ones, were too restrictive and prevented them from achieving other goals. For example, multiple participants wanted unfettered remote control access, especially for lights, because it was convenient.

#### Lack of Concern About Devices
Participants did not feel concerned enough to use access controls for certain types of devices or for devices in certain locations. For example, they did not consider smart lights sensitive enough for access control but wanted restrictions on more sensitive devices like cameras for guests and children.

### Conclusion

Overall, the limited long-term use of access control features in practice highlights several fundamental reasons why participants may not use any access controls, regardless of design. These include social norms, trust, and respect, interference with other functionality, and a lack of concern about certain devices.
