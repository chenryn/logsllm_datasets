Question: "Consider a scenario where a software developer is implementing security measures to protect a program written in a memory-unsafe language against buffer overflow attacks. They are contemplating the use of stack canaries. Which of the following statements accurately reflect the properties and benefits of employing stack canaries in their program?"
 "A": "Stack canaries are useful for detecting overflows that occur due to writing to non-consecutive memory addresses."
 "B": "Stack canaries are placed on the stack to act as a sacrificial value, with their alteration signaling a possible attack before the function returns."
 "C": "Stack canaries add significant performance overhead during program execution, which may affect the decision to implement them."
 "D": "Modern compilers can automatically insert stack canary checks into C code, providing a defense against a range of common exploits with negligible performance impact."
