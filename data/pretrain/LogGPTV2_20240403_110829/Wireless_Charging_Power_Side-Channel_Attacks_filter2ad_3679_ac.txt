The CNN outperformed all other classifiers we explored when
evaluated on our collected data. The second-best performance we
obtained was with a Random Forest [6] classifier that was trained
with the frequency domain representation of the current traces.
Although we were able to get reasonably high accuracy with this
classifier, it was not able to generalize well to different charging
conditions. In contrast, our CNN performed well on all scenarios
in which current traces were collected and did not require any
feature engineering aside from the application of the sliding window
algorithm. Our classifier also successfully identified traces that were
time-shifted with respect to the training data. Overall, our attack
can effectively classify traces collected from multiple devices and
charging methods with the same feature extraction process. This is
critical because our threat model is intended to apply to a variety
of phone models, operating systems, and chargers.
5 EVALUATION
In this section, we present our findings and detailed experimental
results on the website fingerprint attack through wireless charg-
ing. Rank-1 and rank-2 identification accuracy of the classifier in
different scenarios were calculated. Rank-1 counts a classification
as correct if the majority vote picks the correct website for the
trace. Rank-2 accuracy counts a classification as correct if either the
website with the most or second-most votes is correct. The baseline
accuracy of a random guess classifier for the 20 websites is 5% for
rank-1 and 10% for rank-2.
We conducted a range of experiments aiming to identify how the
classifier accuracy changed with respect to the following variables:
(1) device manufacturer; (2) number of websites visited; (3) different
devices for training and testing; (4) different chargers methods
for training and testing; (5) length of current traces; (6) noise; (7)
aging of training traces; (8) battery state of charge. The following
subsections detail our findings and contributions concerning each
question.

Bluetooth, cellular data, volume, and notifications on while placing
them at a variety of alignments with the transmitting coil.
The classifier achieved a rank-1 accuracy of at least 82.0% and a
rank-2 accuracy of at least 87.0% when classifying wireless traces
from the iPhone 11 with trace durations ranging from 2.5 to 6 sec-
onds. Pixel 4 wireless traces were classified with higher accuracy,
especially at longer trace lengths. It achieved a rank-1 accuracy of
at least 85.5% and a rank-2 accuracy of at least 91.5% with trace
durations ranging from 2.5 to 6 seconds. The high accuracy of
the classifier in these scenarios indicates that the small changes
in phone activity that occur while loading various websites are
detectable through this wireless side channel in both devices exam-
ined.
5.2 Extended Website Set
In addition to the website fingerprinting attack on the Alexa top
20 sites we also experimented with a larger data set consisting of
current traces from the Alexa top 50 sites to further demonstrate
the capabilities of this attack. The same current trace collection
setup from Section 3.2 was implemented, although only 25 traces
were collected for each website, the traces were collected without
noise, and the maximum length of each current trace collected per
site was 5 seconds instead of 10. Additionally, the classifier’s final
fully-connected layer was adjusted to fit 50 classes instead of 20.
We found that the classifier can identify the current traces with a
rank-1 accuracy of 98.8% when the traces were five seconds long
(see Table 4).
5.1 iPhone 11 vs Pixel 4
In this subsection, we aim to identify how the accuracy of the
classifier depends on the device used to collect current traces. The
iPhone 11 and Google Pixel 4 were both used to collect current
traces under a variety of conditions. Results from these experiments
are reported in Table 2 (iPhone) and Table 3 (Pixel). All test traces in
this section, unless otherwise specified, included noise in the form
of normal device operation conditions such as leaving the phones’
5.3 Training and Testing on Different Devices
In order to see whether or not a cross-device attack is possible in
this threat model, we trained the classifier exclusively on current
traces from the iPhone and tested on traces from the Pixel and vice
versa. When the current traces from a different device were used
for training, the classifier was unable to identify traces from the
device at all. Training on iPhone traces and testing on Pixel traces
resulted in a rank-1 accuracy of 4.2% which is worse than a random

guess and a rank-2 accuracy of 12.1% which is only slightly higher
than that of a random guess. Training on Pixel traces and testing on
iPhone traces was no better. In this scenario, the classifier achieved
a rank-1 accuracy of 5.7% and a rank-2 accuracy of 11.6%.
These results align with the findings from previous studies that
found a drop in classification accuracy resulting from training and
testing on different devices. This indicates that the power consump-
tion variations depend on individual device characteristics and that
the information extracted by the classifier from current traces de-
pends on the charging device. An effective realistic attack would
likely need to train on traces from a variety of phones to be able to
generalize and account for more trace variety.
5.4 Training and Testing on Traces from
Different Chargers
Current traces from a wired, 5 W charger were also collected with
both the Pixel and the iPhone. Unlike wireless traces, wired traces
from the iPhone were classified with higher accuracy than those of
the Pixel. The minimum rank-1 and rank-2 accuracies of the classi-
fier on the wired iPhone traces were 88.5% and 93.5%, respectively,
whereas they were 63.0% and 79.0% on the Pixel.
Across all device and charger combinations, our classifier was
able to perform well without any preprocessing or changes to the
architecture. The accuracies achieved by the classifier when trained
and tested on wired and wireless traces are similar, indicating that
the information leakage from the wireless charging power side
channel is comparable to that of the wired charging power side
channel for the same device. In the case of the Pixel 4, the wireless
current traces were identified with higher accuracy than the wired
current traces.
Figure 10(a) shows the current traces measured using wired and
wireless chargers while loading zoom.us on iPhone 11. A visual
comparison suggests that the wired and wireless channels leak the
same information when a website is loading; the patterns in the
current traces when the phone is fully charged are similar. The
traces differ in that the wireless traces contain a signal with a
frequency of approximately 11 Hz and appear to be noisier than
the wired traces.
In order to measure how comparable both charging side channels
are, the classifier was trained exclusively on current traces from
the wireless charger and tested on traces from the wired charger
and vice versa. Using 10 websites and 2.5 second long traces, the
classifier identified websites from the iPhone correctly with signifi-
cant accuracy. The results of this experiment are shown in Figure 8.
Training on wired traces and testing on wireless traces produced
a rank-1 accuracy of 60.6% compared to a baseline of 10% and a
rank-2 accuracy of 75.0% compared to a baseline of 20%. Training
on wireless traces and testing on wired traces achieved a rank-1
accuracy of 49.0% and a rank-2 accuracy of 68.4%. The only website
that was identified with over 90% accuracy in both situations was
facebook.com.
The existence of cross-channel leakage across both wired and
wireless charging indicates that wirelessly charging devices may be
susceptible to existing USB power side-channel attacks that have
been trained only on wired power data.

In addition to the full duration traces, the classifier was trained
and tested on shorter duration traces. These were formed by taking
a slice of the first 𝑛 seconds of data from the original trace. Out
of all trace lengths examined, the best wireless and wired rank-1
identification accuracies achieved were with 5-second traces and 6-
second traces respectively. While the classifier performed the worst
on 2.5-second traces, the overall identification accuracy was still
quite high and close to the best rank-1 accuracies out of all trace
durations. These shorter traces removed noise present in the full 10-
second traces because the websites examined take approximately 4
seconds to load [33]. However, most websites take over 2.5 seconds
to load, so traces of this duration cut off part of the signal from the
website loading and therefore deteriorated identification accuracy.
Furthermore, websites that autoplay videos had consistent leakage
in their traces even after they initially loaded.
5.6 Impact of Noise
As evidenced by the results discussed in Section 5.1, the attack
is quite resilient to noise and was able to identify the test traces
with high accuracy, even though the circumstances of the device
varied between training and testing traces. This demonstrates that
our attack is feasible in realistic scenarios where the current trace
collected while a website is loading may be corrupted or altered by
the existence of other executing processes.
In order to measure how well the attack might perform without
noise, current traces were collected from the iPhone 11 while the
volume, Bluetooth, and cellular data were disabled at a sampling
frequency of 500 Hz. Additionally, an outline from the phone was
placed over the charger so that the alignment and angle of the
phone over the transmitting coil were consistent.
The classifier performed slightly better when trained and tested
on the noiseless traces compared to those collected under normal
operating conditions. The full results are reported in Table 2. When
classifying noiseless wireless traces, the classifier obtained a rank-1
accuracy of at least 80.5% and a rank-2 accuracy of at least 88.5%
with trace durations ranging from 2.5 to 10 seconds. We present the
confusion matrix for 5-second traces in Figure 9. For comparison,
noiseless wired traces collected under the same conditions resulted
in a rank-1 accuracy of at least 88.5% and a rank-2 accuracy of at
least 93.5%.
5.7 Impact of Length of Time Between Trace
Collection and Testing
In this scenario, training and testing traces were collected on the
same iPhone 11 except the test traces were collected nine months
after the training traces were collected. Table 5 summarizes the
results of this scenario. Many of the websites we studied had dy-
namic content, such as news. After many months, the media in
these websites completely changed which resulted in the current
traces altering as well. Although accuracy was significantly lowered
in this experiment, the classifier still performed over four times
better than a random guess would achieve at some trace lengths.

labeled 5-second current traces across 20 websites collected
