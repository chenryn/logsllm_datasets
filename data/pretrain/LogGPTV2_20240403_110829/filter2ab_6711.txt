**ATT&CK ID:** T1621  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Multi-Factor Authentication Request Generation

**Description:**
Adversaries may attempt to bypass multi-factor authentication (MFA) mechanisms by generating MFA requests and sending them to legitimate users. This technique can be used to trick users into providing the second factor of authentication, thereby granting the adversaries unauthorized access to the targeted accounts.

**Key Points:**
- **Objective:** Bypass MFA to gain unauthorized access.
- **Method:** Generate and send MFA requests to users.
- **Impact:** Compromised user accounts and potential data breaches.

By leveraging this technique, attackers aim to exploit the trust that users place in MFA systems, making it critical for organizations to implement additional security measures and educate users on recognizing and responding to suspicious MFA requests.
