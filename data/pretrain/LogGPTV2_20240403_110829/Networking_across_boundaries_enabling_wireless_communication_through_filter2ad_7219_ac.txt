in Fig. 3(c) as a subcarrier, an OFDM transmitter can treat
each frequency as an independent channel and transmit flows
on all of them concurrently. The OFDM encoding scheme
is attractive because decoding can be done in the frequency
domain without the need for complex channel equalizers.
5.2 What is the optimal power allocation?
Next, we ask how should a TARF transmitter divide its power
across the different subcarriers? According to Fig. 3(c), a
TARF channel has high SNR at lower frequencies and lower
SNR at higher frequencies. With this knowledge, it is clear
that distributing the power evenly across the different subcar-
riers would result in sub-optimal performance. Conversely, a
power allocation strategy that concentrates all the available
power into the lowest-frequency subcarrier would maximize
the SNR, but also result in sub-optimal performance since it
forgoes much of the available bandwidth.
Optimal power allocation is a well-studied problem in in-
formation theory [50]. The generic solution for this problem

power distribution with respect to the noise frequency profile
discussed above. The TARF transmitter uses this information
to assign power to its subcarriers according to this computed
distribution at the center frequency of each subcarrier.
5.3 How to modulate the subcarriers?
Recall that in OFDM-based systems, we can treat each subcar-
rier as a separate flow with its own modulation (BPSK, QPSK,
etc.). After TARF determines the optimal power allocation, it
proceeds to bitrate selection on a per-subcarrier basis.
Specifically, knowing the power allocation P(ω) and the
noise function C(ω), TARF can estimate the expected SNR
at the receiver and choose the appropriate bitrate based on
its estimate. In particular, it can leverage higher modulations
(e.g., 64-QAM) at lower-frequency subcarriers (which have
higher SNRs) and lower modulation schemes (e.g., BPSK) at
higher-frequency subcarriers (which have lower SNRs).
We note few more points about TARF’s bitrate selection:
• The exact SNR at which TARF should switch between the
different modulation schemes can be determined both ana-
lytically and empirically. In §8, we describe how TARF’s
empirical evaluation matches the analytical solution.
• Our discussion above focused on performing rate adapta-
tion by only changing the modulation scheme. In practice,
the discussion can be extended to adapting the coding rate
(e.g., 1/2-rate or 3/4-rate coding) as well [38].
• Finally, in order for a receiver to decode transmitted pack-
ets, it needs to know the modulation scheme employed by
every subcarrier. Such information is typically embedded
in the packet header which is sent via BPSK modulation.
5.4 How to adapt the bitrate?
So far, our discussion has assumed that TARF’s transmitter
has perfect knowledge of the noise function C(ω). Unfortu-
nately, however, TARF does not have direct access to channel
information. This is because TARF can only perform one-
way communication; hence, the receiver is unable to send the
channel estimates as feedback to the transmitter. To accommo-
date for channel uncertainty and frequency-selective fading,
one-way communication systems are typically conservative:
They choose modulation schemes with very low bitrate and
large redundancy. For example, a GPS transmitter spreads
every bit over 1024 chips and repeats each symbol 20 times.
To overcome this challenge, a TARF transmitter can lever-
age known properties of the channel and combine them with
side-channel information. In particular, recall from §4.2 that
the only unknown components of the attenuation are the
height above the water d0 and the depth of the TARF transmit-
ter r. Hence, if TARF can estimate these components, then it
would be able accurately estimate the overall SNR.
To estimate the depth underwater, a TARF transmitter can
employ a pressure sensor. In particular, underwater pressure

is called waterfilling. In what follows, we describe this con-
cept in the context of a TARF communication channel and
highlight why it is particularly interesting in this context.
Fig. 4 plots the noise power C(ω) in blue as a function of
frequency ω. As per Eq. 4, we can express C(ω) = ρwvwω2/a,
where a is a real positive constant which depends on the
transmitted signal power, the distance attenuation, and the
receiver noise floor. The high level idea of waterfilling is
that we can solve for a water level µ, depicted by the yellow
line in Fig. 4. Specifically, the optimal power allocation is
the difference between µ and the noise power C(ω). We can
express the optimal power allocation as:
(cid:40)
P(ω) =
µ − C(ω),
0,
if µ − C(ω) ≥ 0
otherwise
(5)
So how can we find µ? To solve for µ, we use the total
power constraint, which states that the total power across all
the subcarriers (i.e., the integral of the power densities) must
equal the total power of the transmitter P0.

ωmin
In our context, ωmin is the lowest frequency at which the
underwater speaker or acoustic transducer can operate.
In general, because of the non-linear nature of Eq. 5, the
water filling problem is solved numerically. However, in the
context of a TARF channel, the function P(ω) is continu-
ously decreasing, meaning that the above integral can be
computed without the non-linearity over the interval in which
it is positive. Such interval spans from ωmin to the frequency
at which the power density P(ω) is equal to zero, ωmax as
shown in Fig. 4. Setting Eq. 5 to zero and solving for ω we

is the density and g is the gravitational field strength). In fact,
today’s off-the-shelf pressure sensors have millimeter-level
precision in measuring underwater depth [53].
This leaves TARF only with the height of the receiver as
an unknown. In practical scenarios, the transmitter may have
prior knowledge of the receiver’s height. For example, under-
water submarines trying to communicate with airplanes can
have reasonable estimates on the altitude at which airplanes
fly based on standard flight patterns. Alternatively, the plane
may decrease its altitude to improve its SNR to an underwater
submarine communicating with it via TARF. In the case of
subsea IoT, the expected height can be provided to a sensor
prior to deployment. We summarize the overall procedure of
a TARF transmitter in Alg. 5.1.
Finally, one might wonder whether TARF’s transmitter
could employ rateless codes instead of its bitrate adap-
tation scheme. Unfortunately, rateless codes still require
feedback from the transmitter (in the form of acknowledg-
ments) [20, 21], which is still not possible given the uplink-
only constraint on a TARF communication link. In contrast,
TARF’s transmitter can adapt its bitrate by exploiting side
channel information despite this constraint.
6 DESIGNING A TARF RECEIVER
In this section, we describe how we design a TARF receiver.
We start by describing how the receiver can measure the

plots the power at each distance bin over time. The yellow line indicates the
high power reflection arriving from the water surface.
minute surface displacements, then we discuss how it cancels
interference caused by the ocean waves, and finally how it
can decode the filtered reflection.
6.1 How can TARF capture the minute
surface displacements?
Recall that TARF’s receiver employs a radar to capture the
surface vibrations caused by the acoustic pressure waves. The
radar transmits an RF signal and measures its reflection off
the water surface. Given the very minute (µm-scale) displace-
ment at the surface of the water, leveraging time-of-flight
based techniques to directly measure the displacement would
require few T Hz of bandwidth (since bandwidth is inversely
proportional to the resolution).4
Instead of trying to directly estimate the distance, TARF
measures the change in distance by estimating the phase of
the reflected signal. In particular, the phase of the reflected
radar signal ϕ(t) can be expressed as:
d0 + δ(t)
ϕ(t) = 4π
λ
(8)
where d0 is the distance between the radar and the water
surface (in the absence of vibrations) and λ is the wavelength
of the radar’s transmitted signal.
The above equation reveals three important observations:
• First, TARF’s ability to track the surface displacement is
strongly impacted by its choice of the wavelength λ. On
one hand, a relatively large wavelength (e.g., few centime-
ters as in WiFi or cellular) would result in very minute
variations in the phase, making it less robust to noise. On
the other hand, choosing a very small wavelength (e.g.,
sub-µm as in THz or optical frequencies) would result in
rapid phase wrapping, precluding the ability to track the
surface vibrations.
• Second, the choice of wavelength λ also impacts TARF’s
ability to adapt to ocean waves in the environment. In
particular a very small wavelength will suffer from rapid
phase rotation even in the presence of very small waves.
4The resolution is c/2B where c is the speed of light and B is the bandwidth.

applying a band pass filter to isolate the (communication) frequencies of interest.
• Third, because the phase of a reflection is not robust to
interference, TARF requires a more sophisticated sensing
technology than a simple Doppler or phase-based radar.
To address these issues, the TARF receiver leverages
a millimeter-wave Frequency Modulated Carrier Wave
(FMCW) radar. In the rest of this section, we describe how the
receiver employs the radar and highlight why millimeter wave
frequencies offer a sweet spot for the operation wavelength.
6.2 How does FMCW extract the information
of interest?
In order to achieve high phase resolution while mitigating
interference from other reflectors in the environment, TARF
leverages an FMCW-based wideband radar. At a high level,
the wideband radar can filter the reflections coming from
different distances into different bins. This enables it to isolate
the reflection off the water’s surface from other reflections
in the environment, and zoom in on its phase in order to
decode the surface vibrations. In what follows, we describe
the operation of the receiver in three main steps: surface
reflection identification, phase extraction, and decoding.
6.2.1 Surface Reflection Identification
To explain the operation of TARF’s receiver, we run an ex-
periment with the radar placed above the water’s surface in a
manner similar to Fig. 2 such that it can capture the reflection
off the water surface. We configure TARF’s underwater acous-
tic transmitter to transmit a single tone at 100Hz. The radar
transmits a signal and measures its reflections. It can then
process these reflections to obtain the power of the reflections
as a function of distance. (For a thorough explanation of how
it performs this processing, we refer the reader to [6].)
Fig. 5 plots the output of TARF’s FMCW processing as
heatmap, where navy blue indicates low reflection power
and yellow indicates high reflection power. The x-axis shows
time, while the y-axis indicates the distance. A horizontal line
indicates a reflection arriving from a particular location. Note
that the different light blue patterns over time are due to noise.
To identify the reflection bin corresponding to the water
surface, TARF exploits the fact that the water surface has the
9
largest radar cross section, and hence the highest reflection
power. In Fig. 5, this corresponds to the solid yellow line.
6.2.2 Phase Extraction and Wave Elimination
Next, TARF zooms in on the phase of the range bin where it
has identified the water reflection. Fig. 6(a) plots the phase of
that bin as a function of time. Note that the phase in this figure
wraps around every 0.2 s. This indicates a phase displacement
