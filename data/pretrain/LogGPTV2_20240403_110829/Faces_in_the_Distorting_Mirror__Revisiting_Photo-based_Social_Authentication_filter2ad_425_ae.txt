### CAPTCHA Security and Social Authentication

#### User-Specific CAPTCHAs
Each CAPTCHA is generated specifically for a particular user, making it straightforward to identify automated attacks that attempt to guess the answer. A legitimate user can request a new challenge if they are unable to identify the friends in the CAPTCHA, without providing an incorrect answer, until they receive a challenge they feel confident about answering. Conversely, an automated script will continuously provide wrong answers until it eventually guesses correctly.

#### Outsourcing and Laundering Attacks
Traditional CAPTCHA approaches create challenges that are not tailored to specific users, assuming that any human should have a high probability of successfully completing the task. However, these methods are vulnerable to "laundering" attacks [19], where adversaries relay the challenge to CAPTCHA-breaking services with human solvers, and "smuggling" attacks [9], which trick users into solving CAPTCHAs by injecting them into interactions with benign sites. Our approach is robust against such attacks because the challenges are user-specific: they cannot be outsourced to others who are unfamiliar with the user's friends. Solving them would require the worker to first familiarize themselves with the friends' faces, which is impractical due to the time constraints and the complexity of the task.

### Limitations and Future Work
An attacker could attempt to create a collection of processed tags and compare them to the presented SA challenge. However, several characteristics of our approach make it resilient against such a scenario:
1. **Random Background Photo**: The completely random background photo introduces significant noise, which cannot be predicted by the attacker.
2. **Tag Placement**: The placement of the tag on a photo significantly affects the result of its perspective transformation.
3. **Transformation Variability**: Since the transformation values can be selected from a range, the attacker would need to create a massive collection of processed tags with various combinations of transformations and backgrounds. Even then, identifying the tag might not be feasible.

Additionally, an attacker could try to reverse the perspective transformation, but this requires knowledge of the exact transformation value, which is randomly selected from a range. Furthermore, different types of perspective transformations can be used, and our system can randomly select one for each challenge. Even if an attacker could guess the correct combination of algorithm and exact value, the transparency and rotation transformations provide a strong defense, reducing the success rate of face detection and image comparison attacks by over 80% for two of the algorithms.

### Related Work
Kim et al. [16] were the first to analyze social authentication (SA) and discuss potential vulnerabilities, noting that tightly connected communities exhibit higher risks. In [20], we demonstrated the feasibility of attacks against SA: a casual attacker with access only to publicly available information could pass 22% of the challenges and significantly improve their chances for 56%. A determined attacker, with access to social-circle information, could pass 100% of the challenges by training classifiers with 120 faces per friend.

Bursztein et al. [8] conducted an extensive study to measure the success rate of users when presented with CAPTCHAs from various services. They observed that the difficulty of CAPTCHAs often makes them troublesome for users. A key aspect of our approach is its user-friendliness, as users are required to identify their friends.

Previous work [12, 22] has explored the use of human faces for creating CAPTCHAs. Goswami et al. [12] proposed a CAPTCHA that uses distorted human and cartoon faces, requiring users to identify all human faces without mistakes. While this approach may be robust against face detection, it can be bypassed with image comparison algorithms that map visible parts of the faces to photos within public databases.

Other work, such as [26], has attempted to defend against face recognition attacks based on semantic properties of the photo’s content. However, this approach has a significant drawback: the creation of a dataset labeled with semantic descriptions cannot be automated. In contrast, SA leverages an enormous, ever-expanding, labeled dataset created by users.

### Conclusions
In this paper, we revisited the concept of social authentication and proposed a novel approach that retains its usability while being robust against attacks that utilize image analysis techniques. The key concept is to filter out faces that can be identified by face recognition software and craft the challenge photos in a manner that obfuscates any areas with sensitive information from the initial photos. We conducted a measurement to explore the ability of users to identify their friends in photos taken under realistic conditions. Our results demonstrated that users are very effective at identifying their friends even when their face is not clearly visible or present at all. Based on our study results and a series of observations, we implemented a prototype and evaluated it against face recognition and image comparison attacks. We also verified the usability of our system through a user study. Finally, we discussed the benefits of employing such a system as a user-specific CAPTCHA service or an additional security mechanism to two-factor authentication.
