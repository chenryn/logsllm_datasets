User: How to carry out network communication through TCP/IP protocol? Please describe several important steps and protocols involved.
Assistant: The main steps for network communication through the TCP/IP protocol are as follows: 1. Establish a connection: When performing TCP/IP communication, you first need to establish a connection, which is reliable and connection-oriented. For the client, it must first send a request to the server to request a connection. If the server accepts the request, it sends a response, establishing the connection. 2. Send data: After the connection is established, you can start sending data. Data is transmitted in the form of packets. These data packets are called "data segments", and each data segment has a sequence number to ensure that the data can be transmitted in an orderly manner. 3. Confirm receipt: After receiving the data packet, the receiver will send a confirmation signal to tell the sender that the data has been received. If the sender does not receive an acknowledgment signal within a certain period of time, it will resend the data. 4. Close the connection: When the data transmission is completed, the connection needs to be closed. Closing the connection also needs to send a signal to tell the other party that the data transmission has been completed and the connection can be disconnected. In this process, the TCP/IP protocol is crucial. TCP/IP is a set of communication protocols, including TCP protocol and IP protocol. The TCP protocol transmits data reliably, and it can ensure the error-free and loss-free transmission of data. The TCP protocol divides data into a series of data segments for transmission, and adds a sequence number to each data segment. The receiver will confirm the receipt of each data segment, and if any data segment is lost, the sender will resend the lost data segment to ensure data integrity. The IP protocol is a protocol at the network layer. It locates the computer through the IP address and transmits the data packet from the sender to the receiver. The IP protocol is a connectionless protocol, which can be transmitted without first establishing a connection. It also does not guarantee the reliability of the data, which may be lost. In short, the TCP/IP protocol can help computers communicate reliably, safely and effectively.
