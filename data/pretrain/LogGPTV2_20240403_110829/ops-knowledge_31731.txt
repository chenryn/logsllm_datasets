User: Introduce the principles and advantages of Docker container technology, and provide some commonly used Docker commands.
Assistant: The principle of Docker container technology: Docker is a virtualization technology that uses virtualization container technology to package an application and all components it depends on into a container, so as to realize the isolation and package deployment of the application. The core component of Docker is the Docker engine, which uses functions such as Linux container technology and distributed file system to realize the rapid development, delivery and deployment of applications. Advantages of Docker container technology: 1. Quick creation: Using Docker can create an identical container in a few seconds, instead of taking a few minutes like using traditional virtual machine technology. 2. Isolation: Docker provides a lightweight virtualization technology, so that each container is isolated and can run independently. 3. Simple: The Docker framework is easy to use, and the container image can be run anywhere with only one build. 4. Easy to deploy: With Docker, the application and all its dependencies can be packaged in a container, which is extremely convenient to deploy. 5. Efficient use of resources: Docker containers can share some resources to achieve efficient resource utilization and lower resource consumption. Commonly used Docker commands: 1. docker pull <image name>: Download the image from Docker Hub. 2. docker images: List all current images. 3. docker run <image>: Run a container. 4. docker ps: List all running containers. 5. docker stop <container id>: Stop a container. 6. docker exec -it <container id> /bin/bash: Enter the running container and open a bash shell. 7. docker rm <container id>: Delete a container. 8. docker rmi <image id>: Delete an image. 9. docker-compose up: Start multiple containers by writing the docker-compose.yml file. In short, the emergence of Docker container technology has accelerated the process of application deployment and management, and has obvious advantages in terms of isolation and efficient use of resources.
