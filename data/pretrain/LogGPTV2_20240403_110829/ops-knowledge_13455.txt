User: I created a simple tcp connection server with Twisted framework. I use the self.transport.write function to write data to the client, but I need to flush the data. Is there a way to do this? In addition, is there a way to flush incoming data?
Assistant: There's no need and no way to flush either the read buffer or the write buffer.
