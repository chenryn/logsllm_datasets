auditpol backup
Applies to: Windows Server 2022, Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012
The auditpol backup command backs up system audit policy settings, per-user audit policy settings for all users, and all auditing options to a comma-separated value (CSV) text file.
To perform backup operations on the per-user and system policies, you need Write or Full Control permissions for that object set in the security descriptor. You can also perform backup operations if you have the Manage auditing and security log (SeSecurityPrivilege) user right. However, this right allows access that isn't necessary to perform the overall backup operations.
