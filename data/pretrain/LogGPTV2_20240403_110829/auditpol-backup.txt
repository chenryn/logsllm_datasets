### Auditpol Backup

**Applies to:**
- Windows Server 2022
- Windows Server 2019
- Windows Server 2016
- Windows Server 2012 R2
- Windows Server 2012

**Description:**
The `auditpol backup` command allows you to back up system audit policy settings, per-user audit policy settings for all users, and all auditing options to a comma-separated value (CSV) text file.

**Permissions:**
To perform backup operations on the per-user and system policies, you must have either Write or Full Control permissions for the relevant object set in the security descriptor. Additionally, you can perform these backup operations if you have the "Manage auditing and security log" (SeSecurityPrivilege) user right. However, this right grants more access than is necessary for the backup operation itself.

**Syntax:**
```
auditpol /backup /file:<filename>
```

**Parameters:**

- **/file:** Specifies the file name for the backup.
- **/? :** Displays help information at the command prompt.

**Examples:**

You can back up the following settings to a CSV-formatted text file:

- System audit policy settings
- Per-user audit policy settings for all users
- All auditing options

To back up these settings to a file named `auditpolicy.csv`, use the following command:
```
auditpol /backup /file:C:\auditpolicy.csv
```

**Note:**
If no drive is specified, the current directory will be used for the backup file.
