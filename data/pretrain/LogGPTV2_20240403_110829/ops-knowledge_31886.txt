User: Is it possible to have one script call another and then exit (don't know if I'm putting this right), leaving the other script running? Specifically I want an update script to download installer.py and then run it. Since installer.py overwrites the update script I can't just do a subprocess.call() since it will fail at the 'delete old install' stage.  
Is this possible or must I instead leave the updater script alone, replace everything else, put the new one in a temporary directory and then replace it next time the program is run? Is this considered a better approach?  
Thank you very much and sorry if this is blindingly obvious.
Assistant: Since you're downloading another Python script, you could try using exec to run it. In 2.x there is a helper function execfile for this sort of thing (which wraps the use of the exec keyword; in 3.x you must read the file and pass the resulting string to exec (which is now a function, if I'm reading correctly).
You must always be 110% sure you trust the content in cases like this! It seems that this isn't an issue for you, though.
