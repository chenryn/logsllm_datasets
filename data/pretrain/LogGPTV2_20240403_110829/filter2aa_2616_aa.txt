 Goal 
– Practical implementation ( not just some research stuff ) 
 How 
– Abusing X86 shared resources 
– Cache line encoding / decoding 
– Getting around the HW pre-fetcher 
– Data persistency and noise. What can be done? 
– Guest to host page table de-obfuscation. The easy way 
– High precision inter-VM synchronization: All about timers 
 Detection / Mitigation

Prefetching in general means bringing data or instructions from memory into 
the cache before they are needed 
The Core™ i7 processor and Xeon® 5500 series processors, for example, 
have some prefetchers that bring data into the L1 cache and some that bring 
data into the L2.  
There are also different algorithms – some monitor data access patterns for a 
particular cache and then try to predict what addresses will be needed in 
the future.
