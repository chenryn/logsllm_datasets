  * cv2.resize() function return cv2.error (-215:Assertion failed) _step >= minstep in function 'cv::Mat::Mat'
  * opencv was compiled with cuda version 11.4.3, cudnn version 8.2.4 following tutorial from YouTube
##### Steps to reproduce
    import cv2
    import numpy as np
    origin_black = np.zeros((1, 1, 3), np.uint8)
    cv2.resize(origin_black, (100, 100))
    (then it returns) cv2.error: OpenCV(4.5.4) D:\a\opencv-python\opencv-python\opencv\modules\core\src\matrix.cpp:466: error: (-215:Assertion failed) _step >= minstep in function 'cv::Mat::Mat'
