## Abstract
In this paper, we examine the performance of encrypted DNS protocols (DNS-over-TLS (DoT) and DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH)) compared to conventional DNS. Our study is based on measurements from 2,693 home networks in the United States over one month in 2020, as part of the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) Measuring Broadband America program. We found that for certain resolvers, DoT can achieve faster median response times than conventional DNS, even with increased latency. Additionally, there is significant variation in DoH performance across different recursive resolvers. Based on these findings, we recommend that DNS clients (e.g., web browsers) should periodically measure latency and response times to determine the optimal protocol and resolver to use. No single DNS protocol or resolver consistently outperforms others for all clients.

## 1. Introduction
The Domain Name System (DNS) translates human-readable domain names (e.g., nytimes.com) into IP addresses, serving as a critical component of the Internet's infrastructure. Web browsers often issue tens to hundreds of DNS requests before loading a single web page, making DNS performance crucial for overall Internet experience. Traditionally, DNS design has focused on minimizing response times, which has improved the performance of many Internet applications.

Recently, privacy concerns have become a significant consideration in DNS design. Conventional DNS traffic can be passively observed by eavesdroppers to infer user browsing habits [2, 25]. To address this, protocols like DNS-over-TLS (DoT) and DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) have been developed to send DNS queries over encrypted channels [8, 10]. DoT uses port 853 and establishes a TLS session between the client and the recursive resolver, while DoH uses port 443 and encodes requests and responses in HTTP packets. Both protocols provide confidentiality guarantees, enhancing user privacy.

Previous studies have shown that DoT and DoH typically have slightly slower query response times than conventional DNS [3, 9, 14]. However, these studies were conducted in university networks, proxy networks, and cloud data centers, rather than in home networks. Mozilla's large-scale study with real browser users did not include DoT and did not explore the effects of latency, throughput, or ISP choice on performance [15]. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of how encrypted DNS protocols perform in home networks is still lacking.

In this work, we present a large-scale performance study of DNS, DoT, and DoH from thousands of home networks across the United States. We collected data from 2,693 participating panelists in the FCC's Measuring Broadband America program from April 7th to May 8th, 2020. We measured query response times and connection setup times using popular open recursive resolvers and local network resolvers. We also analyzed the impact of latency to resolvers, throughput, and ISP choice on performance.

## 2. Method
### 2.1 Measurement Platform
The FCC collaborates with SamKnows [20] to implement the operational and logistical aspects of the Measuring Broadband America (MBA) program [6]. SamKnows develops custom software and hardware, known as "Whiteboxes," to evaluate broadband access network performance. These Whiteboxes act as Ethernet bridges, connecting directly to modems/routers to control for poor Wi-Fi signals and cross-traffic. SamKnows has deployed Whiteboxes to thousands of volunteers' homes across the United States.

We accessed the MBA platform through the FCC's MBA-Assisted Research Studies (MARS) program [5], enabling us to run measurements from the Whiteboxes. We used SamKnows' DNS query tool to evaluate DNS, DoT, and DoH performance. For each query, the tool reports success/failure status, resolution time (excluding connection establishment), and resolved record [19]. For DoT and DoH, it also reports TCP connection setup time, TLS session establishment time, and DoH resolver lookup time. We only studied 'A' and 'AAAA' record queries. DNS and DoT queries are sent synchronously, while DoH queries are sent asynchronously due to the underlying HTTP protocol.

The query tool handles failures in several ways:
- If a response with an error code (e.g., NXDOMAIN or SERVFAIL) is returned, the query is marked as a failure.
- If the tool fails to establish a DoT or DoH connection, all queries in the current batch are marked as failures.
- Conventional DNS queries time out after three seconds and are re-sent up to three times before being marked as a failure.
- DoT/DoH queries are marked as failures if five seconds pass or if TCP hits the maximum number of re-transmissions allowed by the operating system's kernel (Linux 4.4.79).

We collected measurements from 2,804 Whiteboxes, filtering out 56 without network configuration information, 25 connected by satellite, and 30 with unknown access technology or ISP speed tier. This left us with 2,693 Whiteboxes, 96% of which had successful queries. The Whiteboxes were connected to 14 ISPs over cable, DSL, and fiber.

### 2.2 Analyses
We analyzed DNS, DoT, and DoH performance across several dimensions:
- **Connection Setup Times:** We measured the time for a 3-way TCP handshake and a TLS handshake, and for DoH, the time to resolve the resolver's domain name.
- **DNS Response Times:** We studied query response times for each resolver and protocol, removing TCP and TLS connection establishment times for DoT and DoH.
- **DNS Response Times Relative to Latency and Throughput:** We examined the effect of latency and downstream throughput on query response times.
- **DNS Response Times Relative to ISP Choice:** We analyzed query response times for a selection of ISPs.

### 2.3 Experiment Design
We performed measurements using three popular open recursive DNS resolvers (anonymized as X, Y, and Z) and the default resolver configured on each Whitebox. Resolvers X, Y, and Z offer public name resolution for DNS, DoT, and DoH, while the default resolver typically only supports DNS. If a Whitebox had Resolver X, Y, or Z as its default, those measurements were excluded from our analysis.

Table 1 shows the latency to each resolver across all Whiteboxes, measured by running five ICMP ping tests per hour and computing the average. We separated latency to DoH resolvers from DNS and DoT resolvers because the domain names of DoH resolvers are different.

| Resolver | Observations | Latency (ms) |
|----------|--------------|--------------|
| X DNS and DoT | 1,593,506 | 0.94 - 5,935.80 (Median: 20.38, Std Dev: 43.61) |
| X DoH | 1,567,337 | 0.14 - 8,929.88 (Median: 22.75, Std Dev: 43.25) |
| Y DNS and DoT | 1,596,964 | 2.00 - 9,701.82 (Median: 20.90, Std Dev: 46.79) |
| Y DoH | 1,552,595 | 0.14 - 10,516.31 (Median: 20.50, Std Dev: 40.68) |
| Z DNS and DoT | 1,579,605 | 2.35 - 516,844.73 (Median: 31.41, Std Dev: 414.26) |
| Z DoH | 1,533,380 | 0.85 - 9,537.42 (Median: 33.00, Std Dev: 8,602.39) |
| Default DNS | 2,009,086 | 0.13 - 41.11 (Median: 22.93, Std Dev: 41.11) |
