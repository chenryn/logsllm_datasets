**User:**
I would like to update my Python 2.6.1 to Python 3.x on my Mac. Is it possible to do this using the terminal, or do I need to download the installer from the Python website? 

The reason I am asking is that the installer does not seem to update the Python version in my terminal.

**Assistant:**
To update Python to the latest version (Python 3.x) on your Mac, you can use Homebrew, a package manager for macOS. Follow these steps:

1. **Install Homebrew:**
   Open your terminal and run the following command:
   ```sh
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```

2. **Install Python 3:**
   Once Homebrew is installed, you can install Python 3 by running:
   ```sh
   brew install python3
   ```

3. **Update the default Python version:**
   To make Python 3 the default version, create a symbolic link to the newly installed Python 3 binary. Replace `[your-latest-version-just-installed]` with the actual version number (e.g., `3.9.7`):
   ```sh
   ln -s -f /usr/local/bin/python[your-latest-version-just-installed] /usr/local/bin/python
   ```

For example, if the installed version is `3.9.7`, the command would be:
```sh
ln -s -f /usr/local/bin/python3.9 /usr/local/bin/python
```

By following these steps, you should have the latest version of Python 3 available in your terminal.
