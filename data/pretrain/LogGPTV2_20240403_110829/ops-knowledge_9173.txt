User: I wanted to update my python 2.6.1 to 3.x on mac but i was wondering if its possible to do it using terminal or i have to download the installer from python website? 
The reason why i am asking this question is because installer is not updating my terminal python version.
Assistant: Install Home brew /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
Install python 3 brew install python3 && cp /usr/local/bin/python3 /usr/local/bin/python
Update python to latest version ln -s -f /usr/local/bin/python[your-latest-version-just-installed] /usr/local/bin/python
