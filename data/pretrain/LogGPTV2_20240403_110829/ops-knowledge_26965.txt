User: Is it impossible to run a web crawler on GAE along side with my app considering the I am running the free startup version?
Assistant: It's possible. But that's not really an application for appengine just as Arachnid wrote. If you manage to get it working I'll doubt you'll stay in the qotas for free accounts.
