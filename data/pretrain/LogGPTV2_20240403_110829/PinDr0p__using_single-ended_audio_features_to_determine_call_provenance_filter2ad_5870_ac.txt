This is largely due to the fact that the PLC algorithm is not com-
pletely deterministic (random excitation). However, the number
of concealed packets detected is still indicative of the loss rate.
To show this, we ran our detection algorithm over 15 seconds of
20 male and female American English speech samples from the

sociation between the number of concealed packets detected and
the packet loss rate are shown in Figure 8. Figure 8 shows the me-
dian and the 25th and 75th percentiles with whiskers speciﬁed as
.5 times the interquartile range. We see that the median number of
concealed packets increases signiﬁcantly as the loss rates increase.
Therefore, the PLC detection algorithm can make approximations
of the loss rate but is not as accurate as the detection algorithm for
unconcealed packet losses.
Our packet loss and packet loss concealment detection algorithms
identify three aspects about the provenance of a call: (1) Whether
the call traversed a VoIP network, (2) the packet loss rate in that net-
work and (3) the codec used in that network. (1) identiﬁes if there
are VoIP networks in the path of a call and (2) and (3) characterize
the VoIP network.
3.2 Identifying PSTN and Cellular Networks
Through Noise Proﬁling
Now that we are able to identify and characterize VoIP networks,
we can look for codec speciﬁc artifacts in the received audio to
identify PSTN and cellular networks.
Waveform codecs like G.711 are used mostly in PSTN networks
as they capture speech without any compression and require much
higher bandwidth (64 kbps) than most other codecs. They tend to
introduce noise only during speech activity resulting in a strong
correlation between the noise and the signal. This is known as
multiplicative noise and its presence can be determined based on
spectral statistic metrics: spectral level range and the spectral level
deviation. Furthermore, the spectral clarity for such a codec, or the
measured crispness of the audio, is very high. In contrast, since
cellular networks require efﬁcient use of bandwidth they use high
compression codecs like GSM-FR (13 kbps). The spectral clarity
of such codecs suffer due to the signiﬁcant compression. Spec-
tral clarity quantiﬁes the perceptible difference in call quality that
we experience when talking on a landline versus a mobile phone.
Figure 9 shows the spectral clarity, the spectral level range and de-
viation for 20 male and female American English speech samples

network.
from the Open Speech Repository [55] encoded and decoded us-
ing the different codecs. We see that G.711 and GSM-FR can be
clearly identiﬁed. Once we identify the codec using these metrics
we can do a simple codec to network translation to determine if a
call has traversed a PSTN network or has originated from a cellular
network. Furthermore these three metrics provide a noise proﬁle of
the network thereby characterizing it.
3.3 Extracting Provenance Data
We have seen how packet loss and packet loss concealment de-
tection identiﬁes and characterizes any traversed VoIP network.
Similarly, the noise proﬁles identify and characterize any PSTN
and cellular network. Together, we can create ﬁngerprints that de-
tail the provenance of a call.
Call provenance ﬁngerprints consist of two parts: (1) the path
traversal signature and (2) detailed characterization of each net-
work in the path traversal signature. The path traversal signature
identiﬁes the networks that a call traversed and the codec used.
The characterization provides more details of each network. The
features we extract can be used towards both these parts as shown
in Figure 10. To obtain the path traversal signature we ﬁrst train
a multi-label classiﬁer as shown in Figure 10 using a repository of
speech samples. Each sample is subjected to codec transformations
and network degradations depending on the networks it traverses
(details in Section 4). For each of the resulting audio samples, we
ﬁrst look for packet losses. If present, we calculate the packet loss
rate which forms the packet loss proﬁle and then add the extracted
codec information and the rate (as G.711 with some loss rate in-
dicates a VoIP network) to the feature vector. Next, we apply the
correlation algorithm to detect packet loss concealment. If the cor-
relation algorithm ﬁnds concealed losses, the corresponding codec
is again added to the feature vector along with the number of con-
cealed packets (PLC proﬁle). We then extract the noise proﬁle for
the call audio and add the spectral metrics to the feature vector.
Since the quality of speech degrades with the number of networks
traversed we also obtain call quality metrics from a single ended
quality tool, P.563 [50] and add this to the feature vector. The
multi-label classiﬁer is then trained on each sample’s feature vector
and label. A sample has ﬁve labels, each indicating the presence or
absence of a codec. For example a speech sample in our reposi-

adversaries who are bound by operating constraints. For example,
adversaries trying to spoof a dedicated line to the bank might use
VoIP due to the fact that they can remain largely anonymous and
can make a large number of inexpensive calls. However, the path
traversal signatures for these two calls will be different. To address
this, the adversary can switch to a landline, in which case he has
lost the ability to easily make a large number of calls and poten-
tially compromised his anonymity.
We can also use the complete provenance ﬁngerprint against ad-
versaries as it also characterizes individual networks. Since this
involves capturing detailed proﬁles of these networks traversed, an
adversary trying to spoof a call needs to be able to match all these
proﬁles. We show in Section 5 that our ﬁngerprints are able to
discriminate between sources that are in the same city using the
same provider, demonstrating that matching an entire ﬁngerprint
is extremely difﬁcult. Accordingly, we believe our approach is a
signiﬁcant ﬁrst step in creating suitable defenses against a host of
attacks possible in today’s diverse telephony infrastructure.
4. EVALUATION
We evaluate our approach based on two metrics: (1) the accu-
racy of our multi-label classiﬁer in predicting the correct network
traversal signature of a call and (2) the ability of our provenance
ﬁngerprint to consistently identify a call source. We discuss the
evaluation of the ﬁrst in this section and analyze the second in the
following section.
4.1 Experimental Setup
We train and test the multi-label classiﬁer against a repository
of speech samples that are subjected to a representative set of real-
world call traversal scenarios and network degradations. We as-
sume calls can traverse one, two or three networks as most call sce-
narios fall into one of these cases; however, our methodology can
be extended to deal with additional transcoding. Table 2 shows the
considered call traversal conﬁgurations. Single network traversals
represent calls that are contained within one system. For exam-
ple, the VoIP-VoIP scenario occurs when two Skype users call each
other. Since both clients are connected to the Internet, they com-
municate through a set of relays (supernodes) and the call stays
completely within the IP network. Two network traversals are calls
from users on one telephony technology to users on another. There
are six possible combinations and for brevity we only list three
of them, in each case subsuming the symmetric traversal scenario
(i.e., PSTN-Mobile and Mobile-PSTN are categorized as a single

tory that was encoded using GSM-FR (originated at a cellphone),
then re-encoded using iLBC (traversed a VoIP network) and ﬁnally
re-encoded using G.711 (receiving end point is a landline) would
have a ’1’ for three labels (GSM-FR, iLBC and G.711) and a ’0’
for Speex and G.729. Multi-label classiﬁers have been used sig-
niﬁcantly in text categorization [52, 33, 60] and we use a set of
standard reduction techniques to convert the multi-label data into a
single label model. The classiﬁer then learns which features best
predict the presence or absence of a label.
For any new call audio we perform the same procedure, but
do not add any label as the classiﬁer will predict a set of labels
based on the learned model. The prediction of the classiﬁer for the
path traversal signature, along with packet loss, noise and quality
proﬁles, represents the call provenance ﬁngerprint for a particular
source in PinDr0p.
3.4 Security Implications
The path traversal signature and the complete provenance ﬁnger-
print provide a useful security framework in the absence of any ver-
iﬁable metadata. The traversal signature alone can be used against

attempt to take advantage of the beneﬁts offered by each telephony
technology. For instance, while calls between two Vonage clients
within the US can be completely VoIP-VoIP, Vonage speciﬁcally
transmits the call over the PSTN backbone due to its QoS guaran-
tees. Similarly, most international calling card services use VoIP
across the Internet as this provides an inexpensive calling alterna-
tive.
Our experiments use speech samples from the Open Speech Repos-
itory [55], which contains samples of 20 different American En-
glish speakers, 10 male and 10 female, speaking phrases from the
Harvard sentence list [3]. These samples are used for standard-
ized testing of PSTN, VoIP and cellular systems as recommended
by the IEEE Recommended Practices for Speech Quality Measure-
ments [4]. Each sample is 40 seconds long, but we consider only
the ﬁrst 15 seconds, as call quality algorithms such as P.563 typi-
cally use this length to determine call quality metrics.
We consider the most popular narrowband codecs for encoding
calls in our experiments. Speciﬁcally, we use G.711 for PSTN
systems, G.711, G.729, iLBC and Speex for VoIP systems, and
GSM for cellular systems. Calls traversing two telephony net-
works (e.g., VoIP to cellular) are transcoded to the new codec.2
Since transcoding is not always deﬁned for a pair of codecs, we
follow the common practice of converting to and from an inter-
mediate G.711 form. We use the PJSIP [38] suite of applications
to encode and perform the necessary conversions between codecs.
PJSIP contains open source SIP and media stacks and is part of the
European Broadcasting Union Audio over IP standard [17]. It sup-
ports G.711, iLBC, Speex and GSM. For G.729, we integrate the
Intel Integrated Performance Primitives Library [25] into PJSIP.
In addition to the codecs, each traversed network is characterized
by its signal degradation characteristics. VoIP networks experience
packet losses which typically increase in correlation with factors
such as routing distances, “last-mile” unreliability, network conges-
tion and over-subscription. For VoIP networks, we simulate packet
loss rates of 1, 5 and 10%. For bit errors occurring from multi-path
fading radio channels in mobile networks, we use a GSM trafﬁc
channel simulator developed for Simulink [32].
Experiments are conducted by taking one speech sample from
the Open Speech Repository and encoding it with the appropriate
codec using PJSIP. Samples corresponding to packet losses or sig-
