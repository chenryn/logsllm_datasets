User: I want to create a user group using python on CentOS system. When I say 'using python' I mean I don't want to do something like os.system and give the unix command to create a new group. I would like to know if there is any python module that deals with this.
Searching on the net did not reveal much about what I want, except for python user groups.. so I had to ask this.
I learned about the grp module by searching here on SO, but couldn't find anything about creating a group.
EDIT: I dont know if I have to start a new question for this, but I would also like to know how to add (existing) users to the newly created group.
Any help appreciated.
Thank you.
Assistant: I think you should use the commandline programs from your program, a lot of care has gone into making sure that they don't break the groups file if something goes wrong. 
However the file format is quite straight forward to write something yourself if you choose to go that way
