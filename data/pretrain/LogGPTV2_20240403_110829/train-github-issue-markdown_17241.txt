### Issue Details
When `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE` is enabled, `setTimeout` is basically broken. It
works the first time it's used, not the second time.
  * **Electron Version:**
    * Every version between 6.0.0 & 9.0.0-beta12
  * **Operating System:**
    * macOS 10.14.6 & Ubuntu 18.04
  * **Last Known Working Electron version:**
    * None
### Expected Behavior
setTimeout should work consistently
### Actual Behavior
When `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE` is enabled, `setTimeout` is basically broken. It
works the first time it's used, not the second time.
### To Reproduce
    $ git clone https://github.com/arantes555/electron-bug-settimeout.git
    $ npm install
    $ npm start
This runs multiple times, with the current node & with versions of electron
from 6 to 9.  
For a given run, it prints `IT WORKED!` when `setTimeout` works normally, and
nothing otherwise.
### Additional Information
Somehow, when wrapping the `setTimeout` in a `process.nextTick`, or a
`setImmediate`, it works.
This makes me thing that it's linked to #7079 and to the activation of the uv
loop in lib/common/init.ts .
