DtypeWarning: Columns (17) have mixed types. Specify dtype option on import or
set low_memory=False.  
interactivity=interactivity, compiler=compiler, result=result_)
#### Problem description
I'm getting a mixed data type warning in a column. The column number is shown
as 17. However it isn't clear if the error is in 18 th column considering the
column index starts at 0 or 17th column by general counting.
It would be better and easier if the column name also shows up in the warning
message to avoid ambiguity and confusion.
Thanks,
