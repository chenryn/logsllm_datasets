the management and monitoring of critical 
infrastructure such as power and water. 
The designers of these systems initially 
designed them to be isolated; therefore, 
the designers of the protocols did not pay 
much attention to security. Recently, these 
systems have become more interconnected 
with public IP networks to provide easy 
access for engineers and maintenance 
crews. The security of these devices is 
generally not the responsibility of the 
enterprise security staff. That responsibility 
generally falls to enterprise infrastructure 
teams. Patches on SCADA systems require 
extensive application testing and generally 
have not been deployed with the same 
frequency as traditionally deployed software 
to the desktop.
Impact: As SCADA systems become more 
and more connected to the Internet, they 
become more vulnerable to cyber attacks.
Enterprise Change: Traditional enterprise 
security teams will eventually take over the 
management of the SCADA space within 
the enterprise and will demand the same 
performance from SCADA vendors that they 
are now getting from enterprise software 
vendors.
Early Adopters: No
What has changed this year: The Stuxnet 
worm emerged this year and successfully 
infiltrated SCADA systems in Iran, China 
and other countries.10

The development of desktop app stores would cause a fundamental shift in 
the way enterprises protect systems from compromise. AV software would 
no longer be a necessity, as the malware detection phase would move into 
the evaluation process before a program enters the app store. Additionally, 
attackers will need to refocus their efforts, not on creating malware that can 
evade detection on a host, but in two additional areas. First, attackers may 
attempt to circumvent the protections put in place by the OS in the same way 
users jailbreak their mobile devices to remove protections. Subverting security 
controls typically involves discovering a vulnerability in the OS that allows 
the attacker to execute his or her code within the context of an already-
trusted application and then alter the OS to disable the protection for other 
applications. The second place attackers may focus their efforts may be in 
sneaking into app stores while masquerading as a legitimate program. By 
creating a program that has hidden features that the app store evaluators are 
unable to detect, attackers can create a traditional Trojan horse and sneak 
their program onto the system.
2.3  Disruptor: The Vulnerable Cloud
Cloud computing is a new computing model that leverages the Internet to 
deliver applications, storage and other computing resources on demand. 
Using cloud computing, an organization is able to purchase exactly the 
amount of computing power that it needs at any given time, without the 
overhead of purchasing and managing its own physical servers.
Although many often discuss server virtualization at the same time as 
cloud computing, server virtualization is an important topic on its own. By 
completely isolating multiple OS environments on a single server platform,

Developing Nations’ Use of the 
Internet
Year: 2015
Concept: The developed world had to 
invent malicious cyber activity; the rest of 
the world can simply adopt it and refine it. 
This is not an argument that people from 
the developing world are more likely to 
become cyber criminals, though in some 
cultures, they are. Rather, the sheer number 
of people in meager circumstances who will 
soon have online access is great enough to 
cause a serious drain on the world’s cyber 
defense resources.
Impact: Increased volume of malicious 
cyber activity
Enterprise Change: Shift in the Center of 
Gravity away from commercial entities and 
toward governments in terms of volume 
of money spent on cyber defense and the 
quantity of compliance laws passed.
Early Adopters: Yes (2009)
What has changed this year: The 
US government created the US Cyber 
Command11 and the UK government 
classified cyber crime as a tier 1 threat, 
putting it in the same category as 
international terrorism.12 Other countries 
have moved in similar directions.

organizations are able to cut down on the number of physical servers in 
datacenters, saving a potentially large sum on electricity and maintenance 
costs. Adoption of virtualization technology into the datacenter, which started 
about 5 years ago, has now reached a point where it is entrenched in many 
environments. Though implementing virtualization brings about a number of 
savings in management and maintenance, it also brings about several new 
and complex security considerations.
Cloud computing has become an increasingly important part of the IT 
landscape and is making inroads into most corporations. The use of 
virtualization along with cloud computing is one marriage of technologies that 
reaps in a lot of profit and ease of use for enterprises; however, while there are 
many tangible benefits to adopting cloud computing as either a supplement or 
replacement to traditional client-server environments, there are many potential 
security pitfalls also.
Cloud computing is a disruptor to the current model of doing business 
because the majority of enterprises currently rely on local hardware and 
software for most of their needs. The concept of sending data to a cloud for 
processing or having hardware resources within a cloud is still alien and still 
sounds like a risky proposition; however, recently, more and more enterprises 
are moving toward the cloud. This increased movement toward the cloud is 
in spite of the threats and risks associated with using the cloud. iDefense 
predicts that a large part of the enterprise community will shift to using the 
cloud within the next 5 years.
Once the shift to the cloud happens, the whole security industry will be in a 
state of flux. Security service providers will have to learn to deal with the new 
attack vectors and threats that the cloud model brings in; employees will have 
to relearn safe computing habits. On the other side, malicious actors will have 
to create new malware and delivery mechanisms that can attack the cloud. 
For a few years, the security community will witness an escalating arms race 
between security companies and malicious actors. 
Given the eventuality in the migration to the cloud, it is interesting and a 
learning experience to try to foresee what would happen if the cloud model 
were to collapse. What changes would businesses have to make? What would 
the economic costs be? Would it even be possible to rapidly move out of the 
cloud? The next few sections explore the answers to these questions in a 
post-attack cloud world.
It is an undisputable fact that any new technology faces umpteen numbers 
of hidden threats. Cloud technology is also susceptible to many unknown 
threats apart from the threats that can be foreseen. iDefense has written about 
the various possible threats in iDefense’s Topical Research Report “Cloud 
Computing.”37 For the purposes of this discussion, assume that one or several 
of the threats mentioned in that paper have occurred and have brought the 
cloud to its knees.
The cloud being the single point of failure, companies will have to figure out 
ways to move quickly from one cloud to another. If the cloud vendor itself has

Cyber Terrorism
Year: 2019
Concept: This is the act of engaging in 
terrorism practices via a cyberspace vector 
alone that causes fear to the general 
populace by threatening or creating 
violence, in some cases instigating 
significant socio-economic or political 
disturbances.
Impact: The cyber security community has 
discussed cyber terrorism for more than 
a decade. Those discussions have not 
produced any tangible remedy that is not 
general in nature and can be applied to 
other kinds of malicious activity (cyber war, 
cyber crime, cyber espionage, etc). When 
the first death occurs as a result of a cyber 
terrorist attack, the game will change.
Enterprise Change: Enterprises will react 
to draconian compliance laws, which some 
governments enacted in an effort to keep 
their citizens safe.
Early Adopters: No
What has changed this year: Nothing

a large physical presence, it can also move operations around the globe in an 
attempt to allay the threat.
If the enterprise were using the cloud as an infrastructure, as in the concept of 
“infrastructure as a service” (IaaS) hosting place, an attack on the cloud would 
mean that, internally, the employees of the company would not be able to 
access the servers (those containing databases, e-mail, etc.), and, externally, 
the customers will not be able to access the services the servers provide. This 
is the worst-case scenario for cloud services since an enterprise in such a 
situation will not be able to move quickly across cloud service vendors or to 
quickly bring up its own hardware. What will perhaps emerge as a solution to 
this issue is the use of backup clouds. In such a solution, enterprises can have 
infrastructure in the cloud as a backup mechanism at a lower cost. Enterprises 
will likely choose to use a different vendor for the backup cloud. 
Closely related to the discussion of failure in IaaS is the issue of failure in the 
virtualization model of operations. In the event of a threat to virtual machines 
becoming real, enterprises will have to quickly fall back to using physical 
machines instead of virtual machines. This reversal will impact the operating 
cost severely and will require not only great financial inputs to buy the required 
hardware but also skilled labor to start and maintain the physical systems. 
Such a disruption has already occurred in a small way in the field of malware 
analysis. Advanced malware, which can detect virtual machines, have to be 
executed and observed in a lab that has physical computers instead of virtual 
machines.
In the event of the failure of cloud services for platform as a service (PaaS), 
the applications that the enterprise hosts for its employees and for the 
customers will become inaccessible. It will not be possible to move these 
applications around quickly since they are tailored for particular platforms. 
This limitation will result in downtime and economic losses. Maintaining 
applications in the conventional way (as it is generally done today) on 
enterprise servers can be a backup strategy, but this strategy would negate 
the use of the cloud as the platform for applications.
The last cloud service model is the one whereby the enterprise uses the 
cloud to run software (software as a service, or SaaS). The recovery from the 
disruption of cloud services that provide software (presumably to employees) 
is easy. Apart from making a financial investment in buying requisite software 
for the client machines, the enterprise will have to hire skilled administrators 
who can have the system running quickly.
Among the new policy measures that enterprises have to consider is the 
ability to move to another cloud service provider quickly in the event of a 
disruption of services. Another possible solution is to move to an internal 
(private) cloud for the duration of the service disruption, but the latter solution 
would mean that the enterprise maintains an internal cloud all along, which 
will increase the cost of operation. The last fallback strategy is to maintain a 
part of the conventional operating process in parallel with using the cloud. It is 
not necessary for this backup to be capable of taking the full load of services

MMOs and the Metaverse
Year: 2020
Concept: Neal Stephenson coined the 
term “Metaverse” in his 1992 novel “Snow 
Crash.” In the novel, people interface 
with the Internet through their personal 
avatars and autonomous software agents 
in a three-dimensional space. In the real 
world, the gaming community has adopted 
Stephenson’s Metaverse blueprint for how 
to build MMOs such as Second Life and 
World of Warcraft. Once someone solves 
the technical problem of how to move 
an avatar from one MMO to another, the 
essential characteristics of Stephenson’s 
Metaverse will emerge.
Impact: This will become a completely 
different way to access the Internet, one 
that moves away from browsers and toward 
the use of personal avatars.
Enterprise Change: Robust solutions 
around identity management will emerge. 
Global law will change in regard to national 
sovereignty.
Early Adopters: No
What has changed this year: The hype 
has gone down, but slow technology 
advances have occurred. Blizzard Inc. 
launched RealID,14 an optional additional 
layer of identity verification for players 
in any Blizzard game that allows cross-
platform communication across all Blizzard 
games. Steam Inc. installed a similar 
communication system with all of its 
supported games but did not adopt the 
identity layer.

when the cloud fails, but even if it could replace the cloud partially, the 
enterprise could have some operations running during the disruption.
To sum it up, in the event of a major disruption of cloud services, enterprises 
must be ready to either move all their operations to another service provider, 
move to an internal cloud or move back completely to not using the cloud. 
iDefense foresees that a hybrid approach of an internal cloud and internal 
infrastructure will emerge as the best fallback mechanism. New services such 
as backup clouds, which do not currently exist, may also provide new ways of 
recovering from the disruption of cloud services.
2.4  Disruptors Conclusion
Ten security catalysts—cyber security disruptors—may fundamentally change 
how the security community protects the enterprise. Some disruptors will 
occur sooner than others. Indeed, some companies have decided to become 
early adopters of these changes. Other disruptors may never happen. They are 
so far down the timeline that other security events, technologies or laws could 
derail them. Regardless, enterprise security leadership should consider all of 
these disruptors in their planning process, especially the disruptors within 3 
to 5 years. Planning must begin in order for leadership to fully understand the 
change that is coming and how that might affect the enterprise.
