### Management and Monitoring of Critical Infrastructure

Critical infrastructure, such as power and water systems, was initially designed to operate in isolation. As a result, the protocols for these systems did not prioritize security. However, with the increasing need for remote access by engineers and maintenance crews, these systems have become more interconnected with public IP networks. This shift has introduced new security challenges.

**Responsibility and Patching:**
- **Security Responsibility:** The security of these devices typically falls under the purview of enterprise infrastructure teams rather than the enterprise security staff.
- **Patching Challenges:** Patches for SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) systems require extensive testing and are often not deployed as frequently as traditional software updates to desktops.

**Impact:**
- **Increased Vulnerability:** As SCADA systems become more connected to the Internet, they become more susceptible to cyber attacks.

**Enterprise Change:**
- **Future Security Management:** Traditional enterprise security teams will likely take over the management of SCADA systems within the enterprise, demanding the same level of performance and security from SCADA vendors as they do from enterprise software vendors.

**Recent Developments:**
- **Stuxnet Worm:** In recent years, the Stuxnet worm successfully infiltrated SCADA systems in Iran, China, and other countries, highlighting the growing threat to critical infrastructure.

### Desktop App Stores and Enterprise Security

The development of desktop app stores is poised to fundamentally change how enterprises protect their systems from compromise. 

**Key Points:**
- **Malware Detection Shift:** With app stores, malware detection would move to the evaluation phase before a program is approved for distribution, reducing the need for traditional antivirus (AV) software.
- **New Attack Vectors:**
  - **Jailbreaking:** Attackers may attempt to jailbreak the operating system to remove protections, similar to methods used on mobile devices.
  - **Trojan Horses:** Attackers may also focus on sneaking malicious programs into app stores by masquerading as legitimate applications.

### The Vulnerable Cloud

Cloud computing is a new model that leverages the Internet to deliver applications, storage, and other computing resources on demand. This model allows organizations to purchase and manage computing power without the overhead of physical servers.

**Virtualization and Security:**
- **Server Virtualization:** By isolating multiple OS environments on a single server, virtualization reduces the number of physical servers, saving costs but introducing new security considerations.
- **Adoption and Risks:** While cloud computing offers many benefits, it also introduces potential security pitfalls. Despite these risks, more enterprises are moving toward the cloud.

**Security Implications:**
- **Industry Flux:** The shift to the cloud will cause significant changes in the security industry, requiring service providers to adapt to new attack vectors and employees to relearn safe computing habits.
- **Arms Race:** An escalating arms race between security companies and malicious actors is expected as both sides develop new strategies and technologies.

**Failure Scenarios:**
- **Single Point of Failure:** If the cloud fails, companies must have contingency plans, such as backup clouds or internal (private) clouds.
- **Hybrid Approach:** A hybrid approach combining internal and external cloud services is likely to emerge as the best fallback mechanism.

### Cyber Terrorism

Cyber terrorism involves using cyberspace to create fear and violence, potentially causing significant socio-economic or political disturbances.

**Impact and Response:**
- **First Death:** The first death resulting from a cyber terrorist attack will be a turning point, leading to more stringent compliance laws.
- **Current State:** Discussions about cyber terrorism have been ongoing for over a decade, but no specific, non-general remedies have been developed.

### MMOs and the Metaverse

The term "Metaverse" was coined by Neal Stephenson in his 1992 novel "Snow Crash." In the real world, the gaming community has adopted this concept to build MMOs (Massively Multiplayer Online games).

**Future Impact:**
- **Different Access Method:** The Metaverse will provide a new way to access the Internet, moving away from traditional browsers to personal avatars.
- **Identity Management:** Robust solutions for identity management will be necessary, and global law will need to address issues of national sovereignty.

**Recent Developments:**
- **Blizzard RealID:** Blizzard Inc. launched RealID, an optional layer of identity verification for players, allowing cross-platform communication across all Blizzard games.

### Conclusion

Ten security catalysts, or disruptors, are likely to fundamentally change how the security community protects the enterprise. Some of these disruptors are already occurring, while others are further down the timeline. Regardless, enterprise security leadership should consider all these disruptors in their planning process, especially those expected to occur within the next 3 to 5 years. Planning is essential to understand the impending changes and their potential impact on the enterprise.
