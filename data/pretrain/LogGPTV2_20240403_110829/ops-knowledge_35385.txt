User: Please point out common SQL injection attacks and provide defense measures.
Assistant: Common SQL injection attacks include: 1. Error-based injection attacks (Error-based Injection): Attackers inject wrong statements into SQL queries to generate error messages, thereby obtaining sensitive information of the database. 2. Union-based injection attack (Union-based Injection): The attacker obtains sensitive information of the database by injecting union-based query statements into SQL queries. 3. Time-based injection attack (Time-based Injection): The attacker obtains sensitive information of the database by injecting time-delay statements into SQL queries. Defense measures include: 1. Use Prepared Statements: Prepared statements can turn SQL statements into a template when the program accesses the database, and filter the parameter input before executing it. 2. Input Validation: Input validation is the most basic defense measure, which refers to verifying and filtering the data submitted by users to prevent malicious users from entering special characters or SQL statement injection attacks. 3. Privilege Control: Assign different permissions to different users in the database to reduce the risk of database being attacked. 4. Input parameter filtering (Parameterized Queries): Filter and escape the data submitted by the user to ensure that it will not be recognized as an SQL statement and can be executed correctly. 5. Logging and Monitoring: Real-time monitoring of database logs, timely detection of abnormal queries, and enhanced database security.
