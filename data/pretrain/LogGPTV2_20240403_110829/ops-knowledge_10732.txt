User: I want to change the default environment (the folder where my Canopy files are stored), which I previously set to 'Documents' folder. But now I want to change the folder. If I just delete the folders, Canopy creates them again automatically, indicating that somewhere inside its logs it has saved the default location address, and I want to change this default location address.
Assistant: Quit Canopy
Delete the file ~/.canopy/locations.cfg. You can do this by opening a Terminal window and typing:

rm ~/.canopy/locations.cfg

Restart Canopy

You'll be prompted again for your environment path.
