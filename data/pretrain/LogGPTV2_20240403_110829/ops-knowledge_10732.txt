**User:** I would like to change the default environment for my Canopy files, which is currently set to the 'Documents' folder. However, I now want to change this to a different folder. Simply deleting the existing folders doesn't solve the issue, as Canopy automatically recreates them, suggesting that the default location is stored somewhere in its configuration. How can I change this default location?

**Assistant:**

To change the default storage location for your Canopy files, follow these steps:

1. **Close Canopy**: Ensure that Canopy is completely closed before proceeding.

2. **Delete the Configuration File**: The default location is stored in a configuration file named `locations.cfg`. You need to delete this file to reset the default location. Open a Terminal window and enter the following command:
   ```sh
   rm ~/.canopy/locations.cfg
   ```

3. **Restart Canopy**: After deleting the `locations.cfg` file, restart Canopy.

4. **Set New Default Location**: When you restart Canopy, it will prompt you to specify a new environment path. Enter the desired folder location where you want to store your Canopy files.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully change the default storage location for your Canopy files.
