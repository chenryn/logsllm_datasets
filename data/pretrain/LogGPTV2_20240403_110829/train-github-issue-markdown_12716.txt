Right now Scikit-Learn provides several Naive Bayes models.
  * `GaussianNB`: For continuous features that are assumed to be Gaussian distributed.
  * `MultinomialNB`: For discreet features that are multinomially distributed, e.g. counts of words of occurrences
  * `BernoulliNB`: For indicator features (True/False) which are assumed to be Bernoulli distributed
The obvious thing that is missing is a variant for categorical features like
color for instance. It is of course possible to use dummy encoding to
transform a categorical feature into indicator features for each category but
this breaks the categorical correlation. If a car is red, it obviously isn't
green and yellow.
So long story short, are there any plans to add a `CategoricalNB`? Would you
like to see a PR? Or am I missing here something obvious?
