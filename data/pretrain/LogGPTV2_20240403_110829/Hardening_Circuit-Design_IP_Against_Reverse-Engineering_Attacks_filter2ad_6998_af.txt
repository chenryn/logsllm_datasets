(cid:96)
While efﬁcient OneChaffhd schemes will require ∆ to be
small (as the size of KO is n∆), the IP author should choose
as large ∆ as possible to maximize FR-security guarantee.
This criterion is also quite intuitive as large ∆ implies large
number of secret distinguishing inputs (that are encoded in
KO) on which the adversary does not know the value of F .
Even when ∆ is not so large, say ∆ = 210, security holds
with probability at least (1 − 1/220) which is almost equal to
one. And when the domain of the hidden function as well as
the hamming weight is large, i.e., h, 2n (cid:29) 0, then the ﬁrst
term (∆2/(2n(h − q))(∆/4) in Theorem 3, will be extremely
small. (Please note that we give concrete security bounds,
not asymptotic ones, precisely because it allows this kind of
analysis — one can evaluate what security is possible (in our
model) for any setting of the parameters.)
None of the previous works consider these factors while
discussing the security of DH schemes. For example,
in
the evaluation of the SAT attack [17], four base-benchmark
circuits (c17, ex5, apex4, ex1010) have very small domains: in
c17, n = 5; in ex5, n = 8; in apex4 and ex1010, n = 10. Note
that the authors used each base-benchmark circuit to create 21
opaque circuits. That means roughly 19% of the benchmark
circuits5 in the test corpora of SAT attack cannot be protected
by any DH scheme. It is noteworthy to also point that the
open-source test corpora of SAT attack is used by other attack
algorithms as well [22], [23].
VII. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we gave a provable security treatment to the
problem of hiding circuit-design IP from adversarial foundries.
We formalized a new primitive, called a design-hiding scheme,
that abstractly captures all prior work on so-called logic-
locking schemes (which forms the bulk of prior work in the
area), and our security notions capture the intended goals of
logic-locking schemes. With this formal foundation in place,
we described a DH scheme called OneChaffhd and proved that
it meets our function-recovery security notion in the honest-
but-curious foundry setting. (It is unclear, given the state of
the art in hardware trojan detection, how to achieve security in
the fully malicious foundry setting.) Our work surfaced some
important issues that had gone unmentioned in prior work,
for example the matter of “simple” circuits. We see this work
as an important ﬁrst step towards the ultimate goal of the
5Out of 441 benchmark circuits, 84 circuits have very small domains in
the test corpora.
