INCIDENT HANDLING STEPS
6 STEPS ARE DEFINED TO HANDLE SECURITY INCIDENTS
1. Preparation: get ready to handle the incident
2. Identification: detect the incident
3. Containment: limit the impact of the incident
4. Remediation: remove the threat
5. Recovery: recover to a normal stage
6. Lessons learned: draw up and improve the process
IRM provides detailed information for each stepof the incident response process.The steps
come from NIST Computer Security Incident Handling Guide.

PREPARATION
OBJECTIVE: ESTABLISH CONTACTS, DEFINE PROCEDURES, GATHER INFORMATION TO SAVE
TIMEDURINGANINCIDENT.
▪ Haveup-to-dateschemesdescribingyourapplicativecomponentsrelatedtothewebserver.
▪ Makesureyouhaveanup-to-datenetworkmap.
▪ Buildabackupwebsiteup-and-ready,onwhichyoucanpublishcontent.
▪ Define a procedure to redirect every visitor to this backup website (a static maintenance page for
example).
▪ Deploymonitoringandintrusionpreventiontools(WAF,fail2banandthelikes)todetectandprevent
anyabnormalactivitiestargetingyourcriticalwebservers.
▪ Export the web server’s log files to an external server. Make sure clocks are synchronized between
eachserver.
▪ Deploy attack and vulnerability exploitation detection rules based on the server’s logs and monitor
them.
▪ Audityourwebsitesbeforethereleaseandonregularbasis(monthlyifpossible).
▪ Referenceallsourcesofexternalstaticordynamiccontents.
▪ Haveoperationalcontactsofyourhostingproviderreadilyavailable.
▪ Make sure your hosting provider enforces policies to log all events and verify your contractual
compliance.
▪ Preparecommunicationtemplatesincasetheincidentisvisibleforusersandneedstobeexplained.

IDENTIFICATION
OBJECTIVE: DETECT THE INCIDENT, DETERMINE ITS SCOPE, AND INVOLVE THE
APPROPRIATEPARTIES.
Usualchannelsofdetectionare:
▪ Webpage monitoring: The content of a web page has been altered. The new content is either very
discreet(an“iframe”injectionforexample)orexplicit(“Youhavebeenhackedbyxxx”).
▪ Users:youreceivecallsfromusersornotificationsfromemployeesaboutproblemstheynoticewhile
browsingthewebsite.
▪ SecuritycheckswithtoolssuchasGoogleSafeBrowsing.
Verifythedefacementincidentanddetectitsorigin:
▪ Checkfiles’metadata(inparticular,checkmodificationdates,hashsignatures).
▪ Checkmashupcontentproviders.
▪ Checklinkspresentinthesourcecode(src,meta,css,scripts,…).
▪ Checklogfilesandalertsgeneratedbythedetectionrules.
▪ Scandatabasesformaliciouscontent.
The source code of the suspicious page must be analyzed carefully to identify and scope
uptheproblem.

CONTAINMENT
OBJECTIVE: MITIGATE THE ATTACK’S EFFECTS ON THE TARGETED ENVIRONMENT.
▪ Backupallthedatastoredonthewebserverforforensicpurposesandevidencecollection.Thebest
practice here, if applicable, is to create a complete bit-to-bit copy of the hard-disk used by the web
server.Thismaynotablybehelpfultorecoverdeletedcontent.
▪ Check your network architecture map. Verify that the vulnerability exploited by the attacker is not
locatedelsewhere:
o Checkthesystemonwhichthewebserverisrunning
o Checkotherservicesrunningonthatmachine
o Checkincomingandoutgoingconnectionsmadefromtheserver

If required (complex issue on an important web server), deploy a temporary up-to-date
web server. The server should offer the same content than that one of the compromised
machineoratleastdisplaylegitimatecontentsuchasastaticmaintenancepage.Thebest
is to display temporary static content, containingonly HTML code.This prevents another

REMEDIATION
OBJECTIVE: TAKE ACTIONS TO REMOVE THE THREAT AND AVOID FUTURE DEFACEMENTS.

RECOVERY
OBJECTIVE: RESTORE THE SYSTEM TO NORMAL OPERATIONS.
▪ Change all user passwords if the web server provides user-authentication and you have evidence or
reasons to believe the passwords may have been compromised. This may require a user
communicationcampaign.
▪ Ifabackupserverhasbeenused,restoretheprimarywebservercomponentstothenominalstate.

LESSONS LEARNED
OBJECTIVE: DOCUMENT THE INCIDENT’S DETAILS, DISCUSS LESSONS LEARNED, AND
ADJUSTPLANSANDDEFENSES.
Communication
If the defacement has become public, consider preparing and sending out a dedicated communication
messageexplainingtheincident.
Report
Acrisisreportshouldbewrittenandmadeavailabletoalloftheinvolvedparties.

Capitalize
Actions to improve the handling of defacement incidents should be defined to capitalize on this
experience.
