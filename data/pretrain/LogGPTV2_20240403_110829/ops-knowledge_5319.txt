User: Please use Kubernetes to build a set of microservice architecture with automatic expansion, so as to automatically add or delete containers according to traffic changes.
Assistant: To use Kubernetes to build an auto-scaling microservice architecture, you need to configure Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) in Kubernetes. HPA can monitor CPU usage or other metrics for a set of Pod deployments and scale or scale the number of Pods as needed to meet load demands. The following are the steps to build an auto-scaling microservice architecture: 1. Create a Kubernetes cluster To create a Kubernetes cluster, you can use Cloud Provider or other tools, such as kubeadm, kops, etc. 2. Deploy the application Deploy the application in the Kubernetes cluster, you can use Deployment, StatefulSet or other resource objects. Make sure CPU and memory resource limits are configured correctly. For example, here is a sample Deployment YAML file to deploy a Node.js application: ```yaml apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: node-app labels: app: node-app spec: replicas: 3 selector: matchLabels: app: node-app template: metadata: labels: app: node-app spec: containers: - name: node-app image: node:14-alpine resources: limits: cpu: "200m" memory: "256Mi" requests : cpu: "100m" memory: "128Mi" ports: - containerPort: 3000 ``` 3. Create a Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) To create an HPA, you can use kubectl create or define it in a YAML file. The role of HPA is to automatically expand or shrink the number of Pods according to a set of indicators. For example, here is an example YAML file for creating an HPA that autoscales based on CPU usage: ```yaml apiVersion: autoscaling/v2beta2 kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler metadata: name: node-app-hpa labels: app: node-app spec: scaleTargetRef : apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment name: node-app minReplicas: 1 maxReplicas: 10 metrics: - type: Resource resource: name: cpu target: type: Utilization averageUtilization: 50 ``` The purpose of this HPA is to monitor the Deployment The CPU usage of the Pod in the middle, and adjust the number of Pods between a minimum of 1 Pod and a maximum of 10 Pods to maintain an average CPU usage of 50%. 4. Test automatic expansion Use load testing tools or other methods to increase the traffic of the application and monitor whether the number of Pods is automatically expanded to meet the load demand. For example, use the hey tool for pressure testing: ``` $ hey -z 60s -c 10 http://node-app ``` You can view the status of the HPA: ``` $ kubectl get hpa NAME REFERENCE TARGETS MINPODS MAXPODS REPLICAS AGE node-app-hpa Deployment/node-app 0%/50% 1 10 1 5m ``` If the CPU usage of the Pod exceeds 50%, HPA will automatically expand the number of Pods to meet the load demand. It can be observed that after automatic expansion, the status of HPA will become: ``` $ kubectl get hpa NAME REFERENCE TARGETS MINPODS MAXPODS REPLICAS AGE node-app-hpa Deployment/node-app 82%/50% 1 10 5 8m ``` The system will automatically add or remove containers according to traffic changes to ensure application stability and reliability. Summary Using Kubernetes to build an auto-scaling microservice architecture can quickly respond to traffic changes and improve the availability and reliability of applications. Configuring Kubernetes HPA can automatically expand and shrink to ensure that the number of Pods meets the load requirements. Multiple service instances can be deployed, traffic can be distributed through a load balancer, and horizontal expansion and contraction can be performed to deal with high and low traffic situations.
