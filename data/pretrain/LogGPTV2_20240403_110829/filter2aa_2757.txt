## Goals
1. **SIM Toolkit**: Understanding its functionality and potential exploitation.
2. **Business Logic Flaws in Mobile Operators' Services**: Identifying and understanding these vulnerabilities.
3. **Protective Measures**: Recommendations for safeguarding against such attacks.

## Topics
1. SIM Toolkit
2. HTTP Headers
3. Data Traffic Vulnerability
4. The Extra Digit
5. Summary

## 1. SIM Toolkit
### Overview
- **User Data Header (UDH)**: Used for sending ringtones, operator logos, and concatenated messages via SMS.
- **Message Type**: Directly addressed to the SIM by setting the PID to 0x7F, corresponding to USIM Data Download.
- **ETSI GSM 11.14 Specification**: The message is passed transparently to the SIM without alerting the user.

### Example
- **SIM Toolkit Icon**: Typically visible on your mobile device.
- **Security Parameter Indicator (SPI)**: Ensures secure communication.
- **Message Structure**:
  - UDH: 027000
  - PID: 7F
  - DCS: F6
  - CPL: CHL SPI SPI
  - KIc KID: TAR CNTR

### Behavior
- **Automatic Reply**: The SIM card automatically replies to the sending number.
- **No User Notification**: No messages in the inbox or outbox; only reflected in the bill.

### Demonstration
- **Live Action**: Practical demonstration of the SIM Toolkit in action.

## 2. HTTP Headers
### Mobile Operator Web Services
- **Services Offered**:
  - Balance check
  - Money transfer
  - Downloads (music, videos, wallpapers)
  - Service subscriptions (e.g., custom ringback tones)

### User Agent Switcher
- **Tool**: [User Agent Switcher](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/user-agent-switcher/)
- **Functionality**: Allows operators to charge based on HTTP headers.
- **Vulnerability**: Sniffing traffic to identify headers containing mobile numbers.
- **Reference**: "Privacy Leaks in Mobile Phone Internet Access" by Collin Mulliner.

### Traditional Attack Method
- **Circuit Switched Data (CSD)**: Similar to dial-up, vulnerable to the same attack vectors as regular calls.
- **Demonstration**: Practical example of an attack using CSD.

## 3. Data Traffic Vulnerability
### Scenario
- **Data Limit**: What happens when you reach your data limit?
- **DNS Query**: Have you ever tried performing a DNS query?

### Exploitation
- **Setup**: Configure a VPN server listening on port 53 UDP (DNS port).
- **Connection**: Route all traffic through this server.
- **Result**: Bypass data limits, works even in roaming conditions.

## 4. The Extra Digit
### Flat-Rate Plan Exploitation
- **Condition**: Unlimited minutes within the operator's network.
- **Method**:
  - Add two more digits to a ported number.
  - Place the call.
  - Result: Charged as if calling within the network.
- **Alternative**:
  - Try with one digit or all digits.
  - Divert calls to the modified number.

## 5. Summary
### Key Points
- **Carrier Claims**: "Our technology does not allow unauthorized access. Errors in billing are excluded."
- **Recommendations**:
  - Test and report issues to your carrier.
  - Disable access to premium rate services if possible.
  - Filter SIM command messages.
  - Do not rely solely on caller ID.
  - Always authenticate and prioritize privacy.
