I have an auto-scaling group that's a duplicate of the one created by `kube-
up` for AWS using Ubuntu 15.04 minions, the only difference being it requests
spot instances. When a spot instances is rebooted for whatever reason (they
aren't stable), it fails to launch any pods because of an aufs error. I don't
know if this only happens with spot instances, but this was the case for me
this time, so it might be relevant.
This is not the first time I've seen this error. If I manually terminate the
instance, which causes the ASG to request a new spot instance, the new node
will launch pods successfully.
