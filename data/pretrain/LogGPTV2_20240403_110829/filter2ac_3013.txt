**ATT&CK ID:** T1464  
**Technique Name:** Network Denial of Service

Adversaries may launch Network Denial of Service (DoS) attacks to disrupt or block the availability of targeted resources, thereby preventing legitimate users from accessing them. These attacks can be executed through two primary methods:

1. **Bandwidth Exhaustion:** By overwhelming the network bandwidth that services depend on, adversaries can effectively slow down or halt the delivery of those services.
2. **Signal Jamming:** Adversaries may also interfere with the signals transmitted to or from devices, disrupting communication and rendering the affected devices inoperable.

Both methods aim to degrade the performance and accessibility of the targeted network resources, leading to significant operational disruptions.
