### C. Affiliate Structure of Ad Injectors

Upon manually reviewing the leading ad injection libraries, we discovered that many operate as affiliate programs. In this model, affiliates embed the provided injection library into a client's browsing session using any available method. The library then handles the ad selection process. The affiliate program compensates affiliates based on the volume of traffic or installations they generate. For example, Superfish.com recently attended the Affiliate Summit East, a popular recruiting event for affiliates, where one of their employees stated, "Let’s meet up to monetize your toolbar or add-on" [4].

We reverse-engineered the set of URL parameters associated with affiliate tracking for each of the top ad injection affiliate programs and scanned our dataset to extract affiliate data. Table III provides a breakdown of the total unique affiliates identified. Our findings indicate that the market share distribution among affiliates follows a long-tail pattern. The top 10% of affiliates control 47-96% of the market share for each affiliate program, while the top 50% control 70-99%. This is particularly evident for superfish.com and intext.nav-links.com, where the top affiliate, Crossrider, controls 42-44% of the market share. Crossrider is a platform for mobile, desktop, and extension development, enabling drop-in monetization through major ad injectors. It provides its affiliate ID to ad injectors while separately tracking kickbacks to developers. Other top affiliates listed in Table III are cross-browser extensions and plugins that affect Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer.

| superfish.com         | 494          | Crossrider    | 44%       |
| api.jollywallet.com   | 114,486      | Shopperpro    | 8%        |
| visadd.com            | 885          | Iwebar        | 7%        |
| intext.nav-links.com  | 96           | Crossrider    | 42%       |

| clkmon.com            | 521          | Plus-HD-9.4   | 6%        |
| datafastguru.info     | 57,983       | Browser Shop  | 10%       |
| easyinline.com        | 155          | Netcrawl      | 12%       |

### D. Co-occurring Ad Injectors

The affiliate nature of ad injection creates an incentive for software developers and network operators to load clients with ads from multiple affiliate programs. We observed that 50% of tampered clients fetch at least two injection libraries per page load, and 30% fetch at least four. To better understand this bundling practice, we calculated the Jaccard similarity coefficient between the pages impacted by different injection libraries. Figure 7 shows these results. The most popular program, superfish.com, appears 49% of the time with jollywallet.com, 33% with visadd.com, and 25% with intext.nav-links.com. A similar pattern is observed between other affiliate programs.

This practice maximizes the profit that affiliates earn per client. As discussed in Section VII, each injection library has varying advertising relationships, which may or may not monetize certain traffic (e.g., pornographic content). Many top injection libraries also include blacklists of properties they do not tamper with, which are not always consistent. Affiliates overcome these gaps by contacting as many affiliate programs as possible. This conclusion is further supported in Section V, where we observe binaries and extensions simultaneously installing multiple injection libraries.

### E. Understanding the Ad Injector User Base

Ad injection affects users globally, regardless of the operating system they use. We found that injectors tamper with 5.11% of pages served to Windows machines and 3.43% of page views on Mac OSX. This indicates that ad injection is not limited to Windows but broadly impacts diverse operating systems and browsers.

Figure 8 shows the regional breakdown of ad injection levels, determined by the geolocation of clients. Regions in white either block access to Google (e.g., China) or have a limited sample size (e.g., Central Africa). South America, South Asia, and Southeast Asia are the most frequently affected regions, with 8% of views being tampered. Conversely, North American views are impacted only 2.6% of the time, European views 3-4.5%, and fewer than 0.6% of Japanese and South Korean views.

### F. Long Tail of Ad Injectors

Our methodology focuses on the top 65 scripts used by ad injectors. In practice, there are 19,315 rogue scripts appearing in DOM content. We place an upper bound on the fraction of views impacted by ad injectors in this long tail by calculating the fraction of all page views that include any script outside of the 35 in the top 100 we determined to be benign (Section III-A). In the worst case, if all rogue scripts relate to injection libraries, it would impact an additional 3% of Google page views, irrespective of the browser involved.

### V. Distribution & Injection Techniques

Injected ads reach a client’s machine through various vectors: binaries, extensions, and even network-level tampering. We correlate each of these distribution channels with the most prominent ad injectors, delve into the technical mechanisms that extensions and binaries use to modify client DOM content, estimate the number of Chrome users specifically impacted by ad injection extensions, and finally estimate our coverage of ad injection software.

#### A. Ad Injector Distribution Channels

WebEval, Hulk, and Safe Browsing identified 50,870 extensions and 34,407 binaries performing ad injection. New ad injection software is constantly emerging. Figure 9 shows a log-scale timeline of new extension and binary variants from October 2013 to October 2014. In April 2013, over 1,000 new ad injection extensions were created. Since then, the number of new extensions has steadily declined to about 10 per day. Conversely, the arrival of new binaries does not follow a clear trend. The largest peak, with over 10,000 new Windows installers, occurred around July 2014, with numbers dropping to about 100 per day in October 2014. Of the identified extensions, only 10% were ever present in the Chrome Web Store. The remaining 90% originated from binaries or websites providing off-market extensions, which can no longer be installed on Windows.

**Table IV: Breakdown of extensions and binaries performing ad injection. We obtain tens of thousands of samples for 9 of the top 10 injectors. We denote the earliest date we identify either an extension or binary contacting an injection library.**

#### B. Dissecting Ad Injection Techniques

1. **Extensions**: Ad injection extensions rely on the Chrome permission model [3] to request access to DOM content and privileged browser resources. We statically analyzed the manifests embedded in each extension to determine the requested permissions, detailed in Table V. Permissions consist of a scope and a resource. All extensions in our dataset scope their privileges to every page a client visits, indicated by `http(s)://*/*` or the `*` scope. This behavior is typical of malicious browser extensions [18]. Within this broad scope, 69% of extensions can potentially prevent uninstallation by auto-closing tabs directing to `chrome://extensions`; 54% can access a client’s cookies for any property; and 52% can monitor the installation of other extensions.

**Table V: Sensitive permissions requested by extensions performing ad injection. Injectors can manipulate any page a client visits, modify cookies, and prevent uninstallation.**

| Permission | Popularity | Description |
|------------|------------|-------------|
| https://*/* | 88%        | Access all HTTPS pages |
| http://*/* | 88%        | Access all HTTP pages |
| *          | 12%        | Access all pages, including FTP, data |
| tabs       | 69%        | Create or modify tabs |
| cookies    | 54%        | Access cookies for permitted sites |
| management | 52%        | Control removal of extensions |
| webRequest | 5%         | Intercept network requests |
| webNavigation | 3%     | Notifications for when pages change |
| plugin     | 2%         | Install DLLs or other binary files |

From this list of permissions, we discern that ad injection rarely occurs via in-browser network interception (denoted by the `webRequest` permission, 5%) or plugin access to install new DLLs (2%). Instead, extensions rely on content scripts, which are JavaScript files loaded into a page’s context after the browser renders a document. With these privileges, ad injectors add new `<script>` elements that fetch remote copies of the most popular ad injection libraries into every DOM a client renders. These scripts supply the logic for adding or replacing advertisements, allowing ad injectors to tamper with any page a client visits.

Extensions performing ad injection exhibit a range of other behaviors. WebEval flagged 24% for spamming a user’s social network and 11% for hijacking a user’s search queries. Independent of our ad injection analysis, WebEval flagged 38% as malware. These results highlight the complex nature of ad injection affiliate programs, where extension authors can bundle ad injection with various other monetization strategies, including those traditionally relied on by the malware ecosystem.

2. **Binaries**: We observed two predominant strategies for tampering with DOM content via binaries: intercepting network requests and side-loading an extension. Of the detected ad injector binaries, 86% modify the Windows registry key `HKCU\software\microsoft\windows\currentversion\internet\proxyserver` to install a proxy. Without additional support from DLL injection or installing a new certificate, this proxy cannot tamper with HTTPS connections. Unfortunately, we cannot discern such granular information for our current dataset. The remaining 14% of binaries silently install an extension by modifying the user’s browser profile stored in `google\chrome\userdata\default\preferences`.

This ratio is skewed by multiple binary versions distributed by the same author. If we de-duplicate binaries based on the hosting website, we observe 615 distinct domains in the last year. Of these, 74% serve binaries that install proxies, while 51% serve binaries that side-load extensions. Therefore, we are cautious in drawing conclusions on whether extension side-loading is secondary to installing proxies in the wild.

Independent of these behavioral signals, we examined the labels returned by VirusTotal and Safe Browsing. AVG flagged 62.5% of binaries for search engine hijacking, while Sophos and Kaspersky flagged 46% and 39% of binaries, respectively, as major adware distributors. Not all binaries restrict their actions to greyware. Safe Browsing flagged 17% of ad injection binaries for also installing malware. Like extensions, our results show that ad injectors are often bundled with unwanted and even malicious software.

3. **Networks**: We lack a mechanism to attribute in-transit ad injection to ISPs or network routes. However, we can compare the discrepancy between the level of ad injection over HTTP versus HTTPS from our client DOM reports in Section IV. We observe that 4.5% of Google properties served to users over HTTPS contain traces of ad injection, compared to 6.1% of HTTP connections. This represents a 35% increase for unprotected traffic. Two possible explanations exist: either binaries restrict tampering to HTTP connections due to the lack of technical components required to hook the network stack after encryption is removed, or there is a significant amount of in-transit tampering.

#### C. Estimating Ad Injection Caused by Extensions

The Chrome Web Store tracks two metrics for extensions: (1) the active install base, determined from update requests sent by Chrome clients (even for extensions not in the official Web Store); and (2) organic installs—the total number of clients that ever installed the extension directly from the Chrome Web Store or via trusted UI elements. We refer to all active install bases with no organic origin as inorganic installs. These can occur from binaries side-loading extensions or users installing extensions from third-party websites (now defunct with the Chrome Web Store lockdown, where all extensions must be in the official Web Store). As these install values are constantly in flux, we measure both as the maximum value over the lifetime of an extension.

Figure 10 provides a log-scale CDF of the historical maximum user base for every extension (many now defunct). We find that 50% of ad injectors never acquired more than 10 active users, while the largest user base for a single extension totaled over 10.7 million users. If we consider the user base of each extension to be unique, then a total of 103 million Chrome users at one point had an ad injector installed. Some of the most successful ad injection extensions are organic (1.8% of total extensions), totaling 11.3 million organic installs. The remaining 98.2% of extensions are fueled by inorganic installs. Our results show that extensions play a major role in the ad injection ecosystem, but a secondary delivery mechanism, such as a binary, is necessary for their installation.

#### D. Taking Action on Live Extensions

If we restrict ourselves to currently active extensions (not taken down from the Chrome Web Store), there are 249 ad injection extensions in our dataset, impacting a combined 25 million users. We alerted the Chrome Web Store to these extensions in case any violated the Chrome Web Store policy. The Chrome Web Store classified 192 as deceptive (e.g., violating the Single Purpose Policy [19]), affecting 14 million users; 6 were ad injectors that did not violate the Web Store policies and affected 28K users; 16 developers had since removed the ad injection component of their extension; and 35 belonged to developers now suspended for other reasons. Extensions removed for Single Purpose Policy violations are not immediately uninstalled from a user’s machine. Therefore, we observe no immediate impact from the Web Store’s actions on our client-side measurement of ad injection levels.
