**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Compile After Delivery

Adversaries may attempt to evade detection and analysis by delivering malicious payloads as uncompiled source code files rather than as executable binaries. By using text-based source code, adversaries can bypass security measures that are designed to detect and analyze compiled executables. These source code files must be compiled on the target system before they can be executed. Commonly used native compilers, such as `csc.exe` for C# or `GCC/MinGW` for C/C++, are often leveraged for this purpose.
