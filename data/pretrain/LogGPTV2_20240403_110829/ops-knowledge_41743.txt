I am trying to use `python-mode` and `jedi` for autocompletion in Vim when working with Python. However, in my environment (Vim 7.3 running in Terminal.app on macOS 10.8), the key combination for autocompletion does not work.

After researching the issue, I discovered that Terminal.app interprets the key combination as something else. I attempted to use `inoremap` to remap the key, but it did not resolve the problem. Has anyone encountered a similar issue and found a solution? Thank you!

(Note: This problem does not occur in MacVim with the GUI, but I prefer to use Vim in the terminal. I also tried using iTerm2, but the issue persists there as well.)

**Update:**
The issue has been resolved. I had `set paste` enabled, which disables all user-defined key mappings in insert mode. This setting did not affect the GUI version of MacVim because the paste mode is unnecessary in GUI editors.
