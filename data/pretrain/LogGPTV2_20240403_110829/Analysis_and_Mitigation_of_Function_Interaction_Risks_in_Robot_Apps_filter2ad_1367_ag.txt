Limitations. RTron also suffers from some limitations. First, we
assume the structure of the target app follows the standard inter-
action graph and categorization. If the developer customizes the
app based on totally different designs, then it may fail to discover
potential risks. Second, RTron requires the source code of the robot
app for risk identification and mitigation. It becomes challenging
when the source code is not available. We will explore the risk
analysis and protection of closed-source robot apps as future work.
10 CONCLUSION
Function interaction provides great flexibility and convenience for
robot app development. However, it also introduces potential risks
that can threaten the safety of robot operations. This is exacerbated
by the fact that current robot app stores do not provide security
inspection over the function packages. We present the first study
towards the safety issues caused by suspicious function interaction
in robot apps. We introduce a novel end-to-end system and method
to enforce security policies and protect the function interactions in
robot apps. We hope this study can open a new direction for robotics
security, and increase people’s awareness about the importance of
function interaction protection.

A APP INTERACTION GRAPH
Figure 15 shows a complete interaction graph of home app. Gray el-
lipses denote the function nodes; while rectangles represent topics.
Each two nodes are connected through topics. We use black arrows
to denote these interactions. The interactions of GR-ST and GR-MT
are marked with blue and red, receptively. We also use purple rect-
angles with/without diagonal stripes to denote MSR event-related
and MSR action-related topics. The RSR image-related nodes is
depicted in yellow ellipses.
