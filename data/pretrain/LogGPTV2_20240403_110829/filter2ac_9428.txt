title:botconf2017 Get Rich or Die Trying
In a World where oil is scarce and people click mail attachments they really shouldn’t, One Man sets out on an epic journey for glory, conquest, and other people’s money. So begins the amazing tale of the “Oil bot” campaign: a tale of a single man who ran a sting operation on a good share of the industrial sector, armed with nothing but his supply of off-the-shelf RATs, his very subpar OPSEC standards, and his Nigerian hutzpah. The talk will follow the entire course of Check Point’s investigation into this affair – from the few emails that didn’t add up, through the campaign’s not-so-intricate C&C infrastructure, to the point where we were inside the campaign, looking at all the incredulous details. How do you scam people into scamming other people? What leads a fraudster to leave a trail of incriminating footprints? And what does a Nigerian scammer want with an energy company, anyway? One thing’s for sure: In this brave new world, the Nigerian prince is no longer happily calling to inform you that you should transfer your money to them; it is you who is angrily calling your bulk provider, asking where all your money went.
