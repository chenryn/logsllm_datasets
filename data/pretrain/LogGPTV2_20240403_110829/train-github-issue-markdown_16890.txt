  * [ x] I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
Clarify the section in the docs explaining the static folder convention and

## Current Behavior
I only discovered that static assets _had_ to come from the static dir after
running into problems and then poring over many GH issues.
