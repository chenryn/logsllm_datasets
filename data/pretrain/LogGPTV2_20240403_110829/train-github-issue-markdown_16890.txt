## Issue Description

### Expected Behavior
The documentation should clearly explain the convention for the `static` folder and how it is handled by Next.js. It should explicitly state that all static assets **must** be placed within the `static` directory.

### Current Behavior
I only discovered that static assets **must** be placed in the `static` directory after encountering issues and thoroughly reviewing multiple GitHub issues. The current documentation does not sufficiently emphasize this requirement, leading to potential confusion and errors.
