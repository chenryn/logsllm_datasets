User: When I install OpenCV 3.0 with Homebrew, it gives me the following directions to link it to Python 2.7:

If you need Python to find bindings for this keg-only formula, run:
  echo /usr/local/opt/opencv3/lib/python2.7/site-packages >>
  /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/opencv3.pth

While I can find the python2.7 site packages in opencv3, no python34 site packages were generated. Does anyone know how I can link my OpenCV 3.0 install to Python 3?
Assistant: You need to install opencv like brew install opencv3 --with-python3. You can see a list of options for a package by running brew info opencv3.
