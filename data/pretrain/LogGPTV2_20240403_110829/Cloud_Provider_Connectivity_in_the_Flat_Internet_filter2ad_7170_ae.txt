a handful of networks they rely on, but their reliance on other
networks is much closer to 1 than it is to the other extreme.
8 RESILIENCE TO ROUTE LEAKS
We examined cloud providers‚Äô extensive interconnectivity and the
degree to which it enables them to bypass the traditional Internet
hierarchy. One of the implications of this independence is that the
cloud providers should have a level of protection from certain types
of networking attacks, such as improved security against route
leaks‚Äîwhen a network announces another network‚Äôs IP address
space and attracts its traffic‚Äîwhich have been reported to disrupt
cloud provider services and operations [43, 72, 84, 96].
8.1 Methodology
In this section we evaluate a cloud provider‚Äôs resilience to route
leaks (and prefix hijacks, which are intentional malicious route
leaks) using simulations. We configure our simulation of route
propagation (¬ß4.1) such that a misconfigured AS is leaking the same
prefix announced by a cloud provider and compute which route
is preferred by every other AS. We assume transit networks apply
no route filters beyond valley-free routing and that the leaked
routes have the same prefix length as the legitimate routes, so the
two routes compete for propagation based on AS-path length. We
compute all paths tied for best according to the Gao-Rexford model,
without breaking ties, and consider an AS as detoured if any one of
its best routes are towards the misconfigured AS. This makes our
results a worst case analysis and bypasses the need for identifying
a single best route for ASes in the Internet, which is challenging

Figure 6: Histogram for the cloud providers‚Äô reliance on different networks. We can see that rely = 1 for the majority of networks for each
of the cloud providers, and they have low reliance on all but a handful of networks. Amazon is the lone cloud provider that has high reliance
(5,889 ASes) on a single network, Durand do Brasil (AS 22356) (not pictured for readability).
due to insufficient information to perform tie-breaking [5, 40]. We
use the same 2015 and 2020 datasets used in previous sections.
8.2 Resilience vs Peering Footprint
We run simulations where each cloud provider‚Äôs routes are leaked
by a misconfigured AS. We also consider the cloud provider under
different announcement configurations. We run 5000 simulations
per configuration, choosing the misconfigured AS at random. Fig. 8
shows the cumulative distribution function for the fraction of de-
toured ASes across all simulations for Google in the 2020 topology.
The misconfigured AS always leaks routes to all its neigh-
bors. The announce to all line shows results when Google
announces its routes to all neighbors. For comparison, the average
resilience line shows the average fraction of ASes detoured for
a random (legitimate) origin AS and a random misconfigured AS,
estimated across 40,000 random pairs of origin and misconfigured
ASes. Our results show Google‚Äôs footprint provides significantly
stronger resilience compared to a random origin AS.
Manually inspecting cases where the leaker successfully leaks
more than 20% of ASes found leakers with multiple well-connected
providers (e.g., Tier-1 and Tier-2 ISPs). Google peers with many
networks, so their routes are less preferred whenever the miscon-
figured AS is a customer of Google‚Äôs peers. To verify this, we also
show results for a scenario where Google announces to all its peers,
and all of Google‚Äôs peers deploy filters such that they discard routes
for Google‚Äôs prefixes that they receive from any network other
than Google, a.k.a *peer locking* [76]). Peer locking only allows
the leaked routes to propagate through ASes that do not peer with
Google, which significantly limits the extent of the leak. In fact, we
find 77% of misconfigured ASes cannot leak Google prefixes to the
Internet (ùë• = 0) as all their upstreams peer with Google.
Figure 8 also shows results simulating Google only announcing
its prefixes to Tier-1 and Tier-2 ISPs (including its provider in the
September 2020 dataset [15], Tata). This scenario ignores Google‚Äôs
rich peering with lower tier and edge ASes, and shows significantly
reduced resilience against route leaks. In fact, as Google peers with
most Tier-1 and Tier-2 ISPs (instead of buying transit), Google‚Äôs
resilience in this configuration is worse than that of a random origin
AS. While adding peers improves resilience against route leaks as
it makes routes shorter, changing a relationship such that an AS
receives a route from a peer rather than from a customer decreases
resilience as it makes announcements less preferred.
Figures 7a to 7d are similar to Fig. 8 and show the fraction of
ASes detoured when Microsoft, Amazon, IBM, and Facebook an-
nounce their routes under different configurations. The ‚Äòaverage
resilience‚Äô line is the same in all graphs. The results show that all
cloud providers are resilient to route leaks. Peer locking is slightly
more effective for Google due to their larger peering footprint
and having few transit providers; conversely, we note other cloud
providers would be more resilient to leaks if they announced their
routes only to Tier-1, Tier-2, and providers.
8.3 Fraction of Users Impacted
Figure 9 shows the fraction of users whose ASes have detoured
routes for different route announcement configuration from Google.
Figure 9 is similar to Fig. 8, but weights detoured ASes by their
estimated population, as given by APNIC‚Äôs population database [2].
Results are similar to the fraction of ASes detoured, with a slight
skew to the left, indicating that some of the ASes that are detoured
serve a relatively small fraction of users.
8.4 Resilience over time
Figure 10 shows the fraction of detoured ASes when Google an-
nounces routes to all its peers, and compares results for the topology
in 2015 and 2020. Although Google‚Äôs peering footprint grew be-
tween 2015 and 2020, we find that the resilience against route leaks
decreased slightly. We identify two possible explanations for this
result. First, although Google‚Äôs peering footprint grew, Google also
turned some of its providers into peers. As discussed earlier, more
peers increase resilience, but turning providers into peers decreases
resilience. Second, Google‚Äôs peering footprint was already substan-
tial in 2015 [20]. Most of the new peers are small ASes at the edge of
the Internet‚Äôs topology, which provide less protection against route
leaks (e.g., stub networks transit traffic for no other AS). We find
similar small resilience changes for Amazon and IBM (omitted).

Geographic deployment. Figure 11 depicts the PoP deployment
locations of the cloud and transit providers. The figure shows a
500 km radius around the PoP locations of the cloud providers
(purple circles), transit providers (green circles), or both (blue cir-
cles). The PoPs are plotted over the world‚Äôs per km population
density [34]. We can see that the cloud providers have a similar
deployment strategy to the Tier-1 ISPs, but have primarily deployed
around large population centers and are highly concentrated in
North America, Europe, and Asia. The cloud providers‚Äô PoPs are a
subset of the transit providers, except two locations, Shanghai and
Beijing, where the cloud providers are present but transit providers
are not. The Tier-1 and Tier-2 ISPs have over a dozen locations
where the cloud providers are not present, and have a larger de-
ployment presence in South America, Africa, and the Middle East.
Proximity to user populations. We also examine the percentage
of population that falls within a 500, 700, and 1000 km radius of each
PoP since large cloud and content providers use those distances as
benchmarks for directing users to a close PoP [21, 88]. We can see
the difference in population coverage per distance in Fig. 12 per con-
tinent grouped by type (Fig. 12a) and per provider (Fig. 12b). Collec-
tively the cloud providers are slightly behind for population cover-
age worldwide, with a difference of 4.49% at 500km, 4.26% at 700km
and 5.45% at 1000km (Fig. 12a), but the higher number of PoPs does
not gain much for the transit providers in terms of population cover-
age. The cloud providers have dense coverage in Europe and North
America, and similar coverage to transit providers in Oceania and
Asia despite the areas‚Äô geographic challenges, which include the
relatively large distances between locations and the requirement
to run undersea cables [28, 95]. Individual cloud providers cover
larger populations than individual transit providers (Fig. 12b), with
Amazon, Google, and Microsoft covering a higher percentage of
population than other networks besides Sprint.
Figure 11: PoP deployment locations, with a 500km radius, over-
layed on population density per km [34], for the cloud providers
(purple circle), transit providers (green circles), or both (blue cir-
cles). Both cohorts focus their deployment strategies near high pop-
ulation density centers, with the transit providers having more
unique locations than the cloud providers.
9 CLOUD PROVIDER POP DEPLOYMENTS
CHARACTERISTICS
The cloud providers have built large, private networks to help
achieve their extensive interconnectivity and reachability. We now
shift to examining their networks‚Äô characteristics in terms of PoP
deployment locations and proximity to user populations. We obtain
the PoP locations by consolidating publicly available datasets (¬ß4.2).
During the past ten years, the major cloud providers shifted
investments towards delivering their own content rather than rely-
ing on the public Internet and large transit providers for that task.
One of our goals is to analyze characteristics of the cloud provider
networks in comparison to each other and those of the Tier-1 and
Tier-2 ISPs, since the cloud providers claim their WANs provide
premium performance compared to transit networks [4, 44, 69].
The Tier-1 ISPs depend on each other to provide global reachability,
but some are regionally focused, as are some Tier-2 ISPs, so we
examine the networks both collectively as well as individually.

shows the extent of web hosting consolidation [49], and the cloud
providers are amongst the largest infrastructures supporting con-
solidation. We do not look at the amount of consolidation, but our
work shows how the sites hosted on the cloud providers‚Äô infrastruc-
tures benefit from the cloud providers‚Äô interconnectivity to bypass
the hierarchical Internet.
The state of the art for annotating AS peering relationships
is ProbLink [53], which seeks to improve the accuracy of AS-
Rank [64]. We do not seek to improve or modify these algorithms,
but use their datasets to construct our AS-level Internet topology,
and combine the clique discovered by the two algorithms in order
to identify the prevalent transit providers to bypass in our analyses
using the AS-Level topology.
AS-Rank and other works seek to create metrics that identify the
level of influence and importance of various networks based on dif-
ferent attributes. Customer cone and transit degree from AS-Rank
measure importance based on how much transit a network pro-
vides, while node degree only looks at the raw number of neighbors
for a given network, not the impact of those neighbors [64]. Other
work investigated which ASes demonstrate high ‚Äúinbetweenness‚Äù
on the Internet [33]. However, the study did not enforce realism
(e.g., valley-free routing); enforcing best practice routing policies
helps ensure that the emulated paths reflect paths traffic is likely
to actually take [5].
11 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
Hierarchy-free reachability presents a method to quantify the im-
pact and extent of Internet flattening by examining the potential of
networks to bypass the Tier-1 and Tier-2 ISPs. Even though tran-
sit services still provide critical redundancy to cloud and content
providers, the four major cloud providers can reach a significant
portion of the Internet without relying on the Tier-1 and Tier-2 ISPs.
At the time of our measurements, their potential to do so is greater
than all but a handful of networks. The potential to bypass the
Tier-1 and Tier-2 ISPs decreases transit providers‚Äô relevance and
affects the flow of traffic on the Internet. Additionally, hierarchy-
free reachability shows there are thousands of networks which are
also able to reach a sizable portion of the Internet without travers-
ing the Tier-1 and Tier-2 ISPs, an insight that is not captured in
other metrics which seek to measure networks‚Äô importance to the
Internet. As the structure and interactions of ASes on the Internet
shifts, we should continue to assess and re-evaluate the metrics we
use to determine the influence of individual ASes. We must also
continue to refine and validate our tools and methodologies for
mapping the Internet and its interconnections. Continued research
into networks that benefit from flattening and consolidation can
improve our understanding of impacts on users and the Internet.

10 RELATED WORK
Other work identified flattening [29, 39] and the growing role of
hypergiants, networks that host, generate, and/or distribute most
Internet content [57]. One effort identified hypergiants using infor-
mation contained in PeeringDB [12]. Another looked at whether the
hypergiants should be considered part of the Internet‚Äôs core [22, 23].
We focus on major cloud providers to evaluate their connectivity
and how they reach other networks. We show the cloud providers
have higher reachability than all but a handful of networks.
Past studies analyzed flattening and cloud providers [7, 8, 26, 113].
One recent study examined the interconnections of Amazon, espe-
cially across VPI at cloud exchanges to identify their peering infras-
tructure [118]. Our initial methodology (¬ß4) for identifying peer
networks was virtually identical to these past studies. We then re-
fined our methods based on validation from the cloud providers (¬ß5),
and we use our measurements of connectivity to explore the im-
pacts of the discovered neighbors by incorporating them into the
AS-level topology graph to show how the cloud providers‚Äô intercon-
nectivity enables them to reach a significant portion of the Internet,
even when bypassing Tier-1 and Tier-2 ISPs.
Web hosting has consolidated onto a handful of hosting providers
(e.g., Google, Amazon, and Cloudflare to name a few). Only 17.5%
of the most popular IPv4 and 8.3% of IPv6 sites are hosted on the
sites‚Äô own address space (e.g., YouTube on Google) [49]. Prior work
