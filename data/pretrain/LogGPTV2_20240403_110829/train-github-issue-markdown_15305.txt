##### Description of the problem
I'm trying to render only the edges of the geometry below but I am getting
unwanted edges specifically the ones in violet line. The green lines represent
the ones generated by an EdgesGeometry with threshold 1 and the faded grey
lines are generated by a WireframeGeometry for examination of the whole
geometry of the object.
Green lines:  
` const edgesGeometry = new EdgesGeometry(geometry, 1); const edges = new
THREE.LineSegments(edgesGeometry, this._brickEdgesMaterial);`
Grey lines:  
`const wireframeGeometry = new WireframeGeometry(geometry); const wireframe =
new THREE.LineSegments(wireframeGeometry, this._brickWireframeMaterial);`
*Violet lines were edited in

Also. Here's the geometry in json format generated through Geometry.toJSON().
File is in txt format because github does not allow json file uploads.
