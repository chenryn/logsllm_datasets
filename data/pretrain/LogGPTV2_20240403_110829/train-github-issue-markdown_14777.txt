The Validator component comes with some constraints that require optional
third-party libraries (for example, the `EmailValidator` constraint can
optionally be used with the `egulias/email-validator` library). Right now,
these requirements are evaluated at runtime when the validator is executed. If
you do not have tests covering the validators, you may only notice at runtime
that you needed to set up something when your application breaks with an
exception.
To improve DX here I suggest to move these checks from the validators to the
actual constraint classes to allow to catch mistakes earlier. However, we
cannot do that in 4.1 as this would break applications where constraint
metadata is loaded for classes that are never used (for example, when you
depend on some third-party bundle that defines those constraints while you do
not use all of their classes).
As an upgrade path I suggest to duplicate the checks in 4.1 from the validator
classes to the constraint, but not throw exceptions there but trigger
deprecations instead. So at least we can then finally make this move in 5.0.
