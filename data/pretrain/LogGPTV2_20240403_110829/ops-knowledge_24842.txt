User: Please explain how to implement code version control, and introduce the function and usage of Git.
Assistant: 1. Introduction to code version control Code version control is the management and control of the software development process, that is, recording the history of software code changes, tracking the changes of each version, and restoring historical versions. Code version control tools can effectively help developers with team collaboration, code version management and code backup. There are two commonly used code version control tools: centralized version control and distributed version control. Git is currently the most popular distributed version control tool. 2. Introduction to Git Git is an open source distributed version control tool that can track file changes, coordinate multiple people to develop together, and record changes in each version. Git was originally developed by Linus Torvalds in 2005 and has become one of the most widely used version control tools in the world, widely used in various development projects. The main features of Git are as follows: 1. Distributed version control, each user has a complete copy of all codes, without relying on the server for operation. 2. Support fast commit, rollback, merge and other operations, and can support efficient team collaboration. 3. Support multiple submission protocols (HTTP, SSH, Git protocol, etc.). 4. Support custom branch management strategy. 5. Provide functions such as history records, branches, tags, patches, etc. 3. Git usage 1. Git installation Download the Git version suitable for your operating system from the Git official website and install it. 2. Create a Git repository In the project folder that requires version control, run the following command to create a local Git repository: git init 3. Create a file Create a file in the project folder and add code to it. 4. Add modification Run the following command to add the modification to Git's local repository: git add [file name] 5. Submit the modification Run the following command to submit the modification in the local repository to the remote repository: git commit -m "Submit Instructions" 6. View the history Run the following command to view the history of Git submissions: git log 7. Branch management Git supports branch management, which can be developed through branches and then merged into the repository. - Create a branch Run the following command to create a branch called "dev": git branch dev - Switch branch Run the following command to switch to the "dev" branch: git checkout dev - Merge branch Run the following command to merge the "dev" branch Go to the main branch: git merge dev 8. Undo the modification Run the following command to undo the modification in the workspace and restore it to the latest submission: git checkout -- [file name] 9. Tag management Git supports adding tags for easy history search Version. - Create a tag Run the following command to add a tag named "v1.0" at the current submission location: git tag v1.0 - View tags Run the following command to view all tags: git tag 10. Other commands except the above commonly used Git command, there are many other Git commands that can be used, such as: stash, reset, rebase, etc. In general, learning and mastering the use of Git can effectively control the code version and improve development efficiency, which is one of the essential skills in software development.
