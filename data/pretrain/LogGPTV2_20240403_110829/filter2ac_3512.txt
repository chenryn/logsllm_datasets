### Title: BlackHat US-19: 0-Days & Mitigations: Roadways to Exploit and Secure Connected BMW Cars

**Abstract:**

Cybersecurity for connected cars has become a significant concern in recent years. In 2016 and 2017, Keen Security Lab demonstrated two remote attacks on Tesla Model S and X vehicles. In March 2018, the lab successfully executed new exploit chains on multiple BMW models through both physical access and a remote approach, without any user interaction. Following responsible disclosure procedures, Keen Security Lab released a security assessment report that provided a brief overview of the vulnerabilities, rather than a full disclosure, which is standard practice in the cybersecurity industry. The identified vulnerabilities were verified, addressed, and mitigations were implemented.

In this presentation, we will collaborate with security experts from BMW Group to share our findings. We will begin by introducing the system architecture and external attack surfaces of connected cars. We will then delve into the details of the vulnerabilities, including several 0-day exploits, found in two key vehicle components: the Infotainment System (also known as the Head Unit) and the Telematics Control Unit (TCU).

Keen Security Lab's research has demonstrated the possibility of arbitrary code execution in the Infotainment System via common external interfaces such as USB, Ethernet, and OBD-II. Additionally, the TCU was found to be vulnerable to remote exploitation over a fake mobile network, with the payload delivered via HTTP and SMS (Short Message Service).

Furthermore, we will explore the CAN (Controller Area Network) network architecture of BMW cars and analyze how logic flaws in the Gateway can be exploited to trigger unauthorized diagnostic functions remotely using CAN buses from both the Infotainment System and the TCU.

Finally, we will summarize the exploit chains and discuss the mitigation measures. Together with BMW Group's security experts, we will present detailed analysis, validation, and the rollout of countermeasures to address these vulnerabilities.
