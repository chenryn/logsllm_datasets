User: Today I was installing the opencv by
homebrew install opencv
and then I try to import it by:
python
import cv2
and it return: No moudule named cv2
However, I try to import it by:
Python3
Import cv2
it works well.
I tried to install opencv again but homebrew said it has been installed.
Dont know what can I do now
Assistant: copy cv2.so and cv.py to /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/
You can find this two files in /usr/local/Cellar/opecv/../lib/python2.7
