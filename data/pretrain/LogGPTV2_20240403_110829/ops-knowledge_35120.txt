User: I wrote a simple pymongo code insert a few values in MongoDB instance on GAE and My app got deployed properly from Pycharm but,
I am getting the same error while running following command
appcfg.py -A login-services-1354 -V v1 update . on my cloud shell
The following is the error I got Usage: appcfg.py [options] update | [file, ...] appcfg.py: error: Directory '/home/seshanthnadal' does not contain configuration file app.yaml
Any help would be appreciated!
Assistant: The parameter to the appcfg update command  is the yaml file or directory containing yaml file
