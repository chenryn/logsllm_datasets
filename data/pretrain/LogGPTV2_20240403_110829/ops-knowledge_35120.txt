I have written a simple PyMongo script to insert a few values into a MongoDB instance on Google App Engine (GAE). My application was successfully deployed from PyCharm, but I encountered an error when running the following command in the Cloud Shell:

```sh
appcfg.py -A login-services-1354 -V v1 update .
```

The error message I received is as follows:

```
Usage: appcfg.py [options] update | [file, ...]
appcfg.py: error: Directory '/home/seshanthnadal' does not contain configuration file app.yaml
```

Could you please help me resolve this issue?

**Additional Information:**
- The `update` command in `appcfg.py` requires either the `app.yaml` file or the directory containing the `app.yaml` file as a parameter.

Any assistance would be greatly appreciated!
