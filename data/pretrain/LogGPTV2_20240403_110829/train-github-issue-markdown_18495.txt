I have a Next.js application running behind an Nginx server, with a custom Node.js/Express server. The application is launched on port 3000. Nginx is configured to redirect requests from `myserver.com/mynextapp/` to port 3000, but this setup is not working as expected.

The server-rendered page is displayed correctly, but the JavaScript does not load. When I inspect the network requests in the browser, I see 404 responses for `app.js` and other assets. The requests are being made to `myserver.com/_next/228ef92e59d376f055fc2c6d01c93b82/app.js` instead of `myserver.com/mynextapp/_next/228ef92e59d376f055fc2c6d01c93b82/app.js`.

This configuration worked correctly when I directly exposed port 3000 via `myserver.com`, but I am trying to avoid that approach.

Do you have any suggestions for resolving this issue?

Thank you.
