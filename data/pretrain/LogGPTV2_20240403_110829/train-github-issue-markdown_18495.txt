I have an next/js app behind nginx with custom server node/express .  
I launch it to port 3000. Nginx redirect the request myserver.com/mynextapp/
to port 3000 , but this is not working.  
I can see the page server rendered, but the js doesn't working . In browser
tool network i got 404 response for app.js and page/, because the request is
myserver.com/_next/228ef92e59d376f055fc2c6d01c93b82/app.js instead of
myserver.com/mynextapp/_next/228ef92e59d376f055fc2c6d01c93b82/app.js  
It worked well when i simply opened the port 3000 in myserver.com but i try to
avoid that.  
Any idea ?  
Thanks
