User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Poptop configured for freeradius but still authenticates through chap I'm running Centos 6 64 bit with Poptop and radiusclient. When I connect to my poptop server this error comes up in the error log:

It says failed CHAP authentication but it's configured for freeradius? If I check my freeradius in debug mode it doesn't say anything about incoming queries.

Any idea what could be wrong?

Had That Problem on a IPv6 only Machine, try Executing:

#ping alpha


If it fails, verify that there is an IPv4 match for alpha in /etc/hosts, like:

127.0.0.1 localhost alpha
