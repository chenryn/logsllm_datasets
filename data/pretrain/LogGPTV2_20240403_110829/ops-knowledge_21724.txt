User: Given an Elasticsearch index, please write a query DSL statement to match the query and sort the results by the specified field.
Assistant: The following is a possible query DSL statement, which can match the query and sort the results by the specified field. ``` { "query": { "match": { "specified field": "matched word" } }, "sort": { "sort field": { "order": "ascending or descending" } } } ` `` Description: - `query`: used to specify the query conditions, the `match` query is used here, and other types of queries can be selected according to the actual situation. - `specified field`: the name of the field that needs to be matched. - `Match Words`: Words or phrases that need to be matched. - `sort`: It is used to specify the sorting method of the results. The `sorting field` and `order` parameters are used here, and other sorting methods can be selected according to the actual situation. - `SortField`: The name of the field used to specify the sort. - `order`: Used to specify the sorting method, you can choose ascending or descending. It should be noted that the above query DSL statement is just an example, and the specific implementation may vary according to the actual situation.
