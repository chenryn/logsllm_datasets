### Analysis of Query Patterns in Different Geographical Regions

#### Figure 7: Distribution of Time Until First Query for Active Sessions

**Figure 7 (a): Time Until First Query by Geographic Region**

- **Europe and North America:**
  - The time until the first query is issued within 10 seconds for 20% of the peers.
  - 40% of the peers issue a query within 30 seconds.
  - 1% of the sessions issue the first query after 80,000 seconds (more than 20 hours).

- **Asia:**
  - The first query is issued within 10 seconds for 10% of the peers.
  - 40% of the peers issue a query within 30 seconds.
  - An additional 50% of the peers issue the first query between 30 and 90 seconds.

**Figure 7 (b): Correlation Between Time Until First Query and Number of Queries Issued**

- **Sessions with Less Than 3 Queries:**
  - 90% of these sessions issue the first query before 200 seconds.

- **Sessions with Exactly 3 Queries:**
  - 90% of these sessions issue the first query before 1,000 seconds.

- **Sessions with More Than 3 Queries:**
  - 90% of these sessions issue the first query before 2,000 seconds.

- **Conclusion:**
  - For North American peers, the time until the first query is correlated with the session length in terms of the number of queries. Similar results were found for European peers.

**Figure 7 (c): Time Until First Query by Key Periods in Europe**

- **Non-Peak Hours (03:00-04:00, 11:00-12:00, 13:00-14:00, 19:00-20:00):**
  - A significant fraction of sessions (10%) issue the first query after 10,000 seconds or more.
  - This trend is consistent across other geographical regions.

- **Conclusion:**
  - There is a significant correlation between the time of day and the time until the first query. The workload model distinguishes between sessions starting in peak and non-peak hours.

#### Bimodal Distribution Model

- The time until the first query, conditioned on geographical region, time of day, and number of queries per session, can be modeled using a bimodal distribution:
  - **Weibull Distribution:** Models the body of the distribution.
  - **Lognormal Distribution:** Models the tail of the distribution.

- **Parameters:**
  - Parameters for the conditional distributions for North American peers are provided in Table A.3.

#### Figure 8: Distribution of Time Between Queries for Active Sessions

**Figure 8 (a): Query Interarrival Time by Geographic Region**

- **Europe:**
  - 90% of interarrival times are below 100 seconds.

- **Asia:**
  - 80% of interarrival times are below 100 seconds.

- **North America:**
  - 70% of interarrival times are below 100 seconds.

- **Conclusion:**
  - Query interarrival times show a significant correlation to geographical region, with European peers having the shortest interarrival times.

**Figure 8 (b): Query Interarrival Time Conditioned on Session Length**

- **Sessions with 2 Queries:**
  - 90% of interarrival times are below 100 seconds.

- **Sessions with 3-7 Queries:**
  - 90% of interarrival times are below 1,000 seconds.

- **Sessions with More Than 7 Queries:**
  - 90% of interarrival times are below 10,000 seconds.

- **Conclusion:**
  - The interarrival time is significantly correlated with the session length in terms of the number of queries.

**Figure 8 (c): Query Interarrival Time by Key Periods in Europe**

- **Key Periods (03:00-04:00, 11:00-12:00, 13:00-14:00, 19:00-20:00):**
  - The interarrival time shows variations depending on the time of day, with non-peak hours having longer interarrival times.

- **Conclusion:**
  - The time of day has a significant impact on the interarrival time of queries.

### Summary

- **Geographical Differences:**
  - Asian peers have different query patterns compared to European and North American peers, particularly in the time until the first query and the number of queries per session.

- **Time of Day:**
  - The time of day significantly affects the time until the first query and the interarrival time of queries.

- **Session Length:**
  - The number of queries in a session is correlated with the time until the first query and the interarrival time of subsequent queries.

- **Modeling:**
  - A bimodal distribution model (Weibull and lognormal) effectively captures the time until the first query, conditioned on various factors.

This analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of the query patterns in different geographical regions and key periods, which is essential for optimizing system performance and user experience.
