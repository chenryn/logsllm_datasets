User:  How to establish a secure remote connection using ssh key pairs?
Assistant: Using an SSH key pair to establish a secure remote connection can improve the security of the connection. The specific steps are as follows: 1. Generate a key pair: Use the ssh-keygen command to generate a key pair, including public and private keys. The private key should be kept properly and should not be disclosed. 2. Add the public key to the remote host: Add the generated public key to the authorized_keys file of the target host, which stores the list of public keys allowed to connect to the host. 3. Connect to the remote host: Use the ssh command to connect to the target host. Since the public key has been added to the authorized_keys file of the target host, you can connect to the target host without entering a password. Using ssh key pairs to establish a secure remote connection can improve the security of the connection to a certain extent, especially when connecting to remote hosts. However, to protect the private key and control the addition of the public key, certain security awareness and skills are required.
