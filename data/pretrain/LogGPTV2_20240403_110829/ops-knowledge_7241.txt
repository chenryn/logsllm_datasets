User: I installed both Python 2.7 and Python 2.6.5. I don't know what went wrong, but nothing related to Python seems to work any more. e.g. "setup.py install" for certain packages don't recognize the "install" parameter and other odd phenomena...
I would like to completely remove Python from my system.
I tried running the 2.7 and 2.6 msi files and choosing remove Python and then running only 2.6 and reinstalling it. Still stuff don't work.
How do I completely remove Python - from everything? (!)
I would not like to reinstall my entire machine just because of the Python install...
Assistant: It's actually quite simple.
When you installed it, you must have done it using some .exe file (I am assuming). Just run that .exe again, and then there will be options to modify Python. Just select the "Complete Uninstall" option, and the EXE will completely wipe out python for you.
Also, you might have to checkbox the "Remove Python from PATH". By default it is selected, but you may as well check it to be sure :)
