Hello, I start to use TypeScript recently. It's super useful language for me
:)  
By the way, I'm in a tutorial about `String Type` in here
https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/basic-types.html
**TypeScript Version:**
1.8.10
**Code**
## It _doesn't_ work.
_hello.ts_
    let name: string = "bob";
Whenever I compile, the compiler will emit the following.
    $ tsc hello.ts
    ../../usr/local/lib/node_modules/typescript/lib/lib.d.ts(16757,13): error TS2451: Cannot redeclare block-scoped variable 'name'.
    hello.ts(1,5): error TS2451: Cannot redeclare block-scoped variable 'name'.
## It works.
_hello.ts_
    let aname: string = "bob";
## Expecting Behavior
I read a part of the `lib.d.ts` and it has `declare var name: string;`. So I
may understand the compiler emits an error. However what concept cannot we use
the variable `name` in TypeScript?  
And I think the tutorial which doesn't work is not good :(  
Or is there something is wrong with me? I hope to replay an answer :)
