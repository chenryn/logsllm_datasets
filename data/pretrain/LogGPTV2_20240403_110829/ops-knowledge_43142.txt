User: I have a problem as follows:
Server process 1

Constantly sends updates that occur to a datastore

Server process 2

Clients contact the server, which queries the datastore, and returns a result

The thing is, the results that process 1 and process 2 are sending back the client are totally different and unrelated.
How does one decompose this?
Do you just have one process constantly sending data, and define the protocol to have a bit which corresponds to whether the return type is 1 or 2?
Do you have two processes? How do they share the datastore then (it is just a structure not a database)?
Thanks!
Assistant: Why not use a database instead of "just a structure"?  Both relational and non-relational DBs offer many practical advantages (separate processes using them, take care of replication [[and/or snapshots, backups, ...]], rich functionality if you need it for the "queries", and so on, and so forth).
Worst case, the "just a structure" can be handled by a third process that's entirely dedicated to it (basically mimicking what any DB engine would offer -- though the engine would probably do it better and faster;-), allowing you to at least keep a good decomposition (with the two server processes both interacting with the "datastore process").
