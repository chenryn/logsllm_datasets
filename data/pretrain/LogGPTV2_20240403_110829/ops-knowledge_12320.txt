User: The story began with a very strange error while I was running my script from PyDev. Running the same script from outside will not encounter the same problem.

Fatal Python error: Py_Initialize: can't initialize sys standard streams
  File "C:\Python26\lib\encodings\__init__.py", line 123
    raise CodecRegistryError,\

I was able to find why this is happening: In PyDev I use two different Python versions: 3.1 that is the default installation and 2.6 as the alternative one.
My Windows Environment does not contains PYTHONHOME, CLASSPATH, PYTHONPATH but PyDev does add them.
Now the problem is at one stage my python script does execute another python script using os.system(python second.py) and the second script will fail with the above error.
Now I'm looking to find a way to prevent this issue, issue that is happening because it will run the execute the default python using the settings for the non-default one (added by PyDev).
I do not want to change the standard call (python file.py) but I want to be able to run my script from pydev without problem and being able to use default or alternative python environment. 
Any ideas?
Assistant: I found a solution that seams acceptable specially because it will not interfere with running the scripts on other systems, just to run python -E second.py - this will force Python to ignore PYTHON* environment variables.
