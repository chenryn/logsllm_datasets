This problem boils down to ﬁnding a best vertex matching
on a weighted bipartite graph, with ng vertices on one side
representing the genotypes of ng individuals, and nm on
the other side representing the methylation proﬁles of nm
individuals. Each edge between any two vertices pair (j, k)
to wj,k. As the number of possible
has a weight equal
assignments increases with O(max(ng, nm)min(ng,nm)), the
naive matching approach is computationally intractable if
both ng and nm are big. Fortunately,
there exist several
algorithms in the literature that ﬁnd the maximum weight
assignment in polynomial time. In our experiments, we use
the blossom algorithm [27], because it only has a complexity
of O((ng +nm)3) and it can also be applied to general graphs.
Of course, if nm = 1 or ng = 1, there is no need to use
any maximum weight assignment algorithm as one can simply
select the genotype (cid:2)sj, respectively methylation proﬁle (cid:2)ek,
maximizing wj,1, respectively w1,k, and the complexity is then
linear in ng, respectively nm.
C. Statistical Validation of the Best Matching
In order to evaluate the signiﬁcance of the match score
between genotype (cid:2)sj and methylation proﬁle (cid:2)ek, we rely on
the z-test and the corresponding z-score, deﬁned as zj,k =
(wj,k − μ( (cid:2)wk)) /σ( (cid:2)wk), where (cid:2)wk is the vector of match
scores between methylation proﬁle of individual k, (cid:2)ek, and all
genotypes in S, μ( (cid:2)wk) is its mean, and σ( (cid:2)wk) is its standard
deviation. The z-score can be similarly derived between the
genotype (cid:2)sj of individual j and all methylation proﬁles in
E. The only requirement is that the cardinality of the set over
which we compute the mean and variance is large enough. The
z-score allows us to determine, once a methylation proﬁle is
mapped to a genotype, whether these two proﬁles correspond
to the same individual. Indeed, the pair that maximizes the
match score might not be the one between the proﬁles of the
same individual, especially when the individual’s data is not
part of one of the sets E or S. In this case, we should be
able to detect that the mapped pair does not contain the same
individual. This is done by validating the mapped pair for a
z-score greater than a given threshold.
If nm-by-ng matching becomes computationally infeasible,
it is worth noting that it is also possible to map methylation
proﬁles one-by-one to genotypes, i.e., carry out nm times a
one-by-ng matching whose complexity is then linear in nmng.
Moreover, it can occur that the adversary has access to multiple
methylation proﬁles of the same person but at different points
in time. In this case, it can also be beneﬁcial to rely on
the one-by-ng matching, which allows multiple methylation
proﬁles to be mapped to the same genotype, contrary to the
bipartite graph matching. In case the adversary is certain
that
there is only one methylation proﬁle per individual,
the nm-by-ng matching outperforms the one-by-ng matching
(see Section VI), but if he is not sure about the number of
methylation proﬁles per individual, the nm-by-ng matching
becomes more challenging to use.
V. DATASET
The dataset that was used in this study consists of meQTLs
determined from a set of 75 individuals, 42 of which have
parental relations (21 mother/child pairs) for which whole
blood was available. The DNA methylation was determined
using whole genome bisulﬁte sequencing (WGBS), allowing
a genome wide measurement of the DNA methylation levels
for all 28 million CpG dinucleotides. The sequencing data was
processed using an in-house processing pipeline consisting of
alignment of the sequencing reads, quality assessment, and
methylation calling. Then, the genotype was determined at
known SNP loci listed in the dbSNP database version 141,
using the Bis-SNP tool, which calls SNP genotypes from
WGBS data [28]. For the majority of individuals (67 out of
75), samples collected at the birth of the child, referred to as
t0, were available, but also at later times: one year (t1), up to
8 years (t8) for some individuals after birth.
Such a longitudinal dataset containing individuals with
parental relations represents a very unique and valuable data
source in the biomedical community. Note that this dataset
cannot be released publicly yet, but will be certainly made
available to researchers in a near future.
On a subset of these samples, we selected the CpGs based
on their high variance across the dataset. CpG showing a very
stable methylation proﬁle across the subset of samples were
discarded, as they are not expected to be under the inﬂuence
of meQTLs. meQTLs were determined using a Spearman
rank correlation test [29] (false discovery rate threshold after
Benjamini-Hochberg correction [30] of 1%) for all SNPs
located within 50 kb (kilobases) up-/downstream of the CpG
showing highly variable methylation. This ﬁltering process
eventually output 568,103 meQTL-methylation pairs contain-
ing 502 methylation regions and 544,762 different SNPs. This
implies an average number of approximately 1132 meQTLs
per methylation region.
VI. ATTACK EVALUATION
We present here our main experimental results, using the
dataset described in the previous section. As explained in
Section IV, the training phase relies on two different phases:
(i) identify the meQTLs, i.e., the positions in the genotype
that inﬂuence the methylation levels, and (ii) quantify the
magnitude of this inﬂuence. As we carry out the ﬁrst step
similarly for all experiments, we present it ﬁrst. This can also
be seen as a data preprocessing step, which ﬁlters out non-
relevant genotypic positions and methylation regions.
A. Generic Training Phase
We focus here on the meQTL-methylation pairs with a
Spearman rank correlation coefﬁcient larger than 0.49 (FDR
threshold after Benjamini-Hochberg correction of 1%). This
provides us with 326 methylation regions and 9,532 pairs,
i.e., around 29 meQTLs per methylation region. Then, we
keep only one most correlated meQTL for each methylation
region, resulting in 326 pairs, as expected. Filtering out the
meQTLs for which no information was available on dbSNP,

we are left with 314 meQTL-methylation pairs. Finally, since
we have to compute the variance (see below) of the conditional
j, we

Normal Distribution Function: The ﬁrst step towards
precisely modeling the inﬂuence of meQTLs on methylation
regions is the selection of the continuous distribution function
that best ﬁts the observed data. We rely on the normal
distribution which happens to be well ﬁtted from both a visual
and statistical perspective. First, in order to evaluate if the
normal distribution approximation was statistically signiﬁcant,
we applied the one-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to all
293 meQTL-methylation region pairs and possible genotype
∈ {0, 1, 2}. The null hypothesis (the samples
values, gi
j
belonging to the normal distribution) was only rejected in a
minority of cases at signiﬁcant level 0.05 (134 out of 879).
When we inspected those few cases manually, we found that
all of those cases contained either a very few outliers or almost
all of the methylation levels belonged to the exact same bin
in the histogram and thus were almost exactly the same.

as the empirical distribution of methylation levels given each

possible genotype of a representative pair (M i
dataset. Moreover, it also displays the corresponding normal
distributions induced by the unbiased estimators of the mean
and standard deviation. The Q-Q plots depict on the x-axis
the theoretical quantiles of a standard normal distribution.
The y-axis displays the normalized quantiles of the sample
j. Given the minor discrepancies
distribution for each Gi
between the points and the diagonal, we can expect that the
normal distribution will be a sufﬁciently good ﬁt for the attack.
Second, the part of the ﬁgure at the bottom right conﬁrms that
the normal distribution indeed is a good approximation for the
conditional probability. More importantly, it also shows that
the overlap between the distributions conditioned on different
genotype values is small, which can be used to recover the
correct genotype given the methylation level. This gives the
intuition behind our re-identiﬁcation attack.

B. Experiment-speciﬁc Training and Testing Sets
In this second phase, we quantify the magnitude of the
inﬂuence of each meQTL on its corresponding methylation
region. From now on, in order to illustrate the performance
of the attack under different scenarios, we build our training
dataset from different subsets of the whole dataset described
in Section V. We consider three different
training/testing
experimental setups. In the ﬁrst scenario, referred to as (a), we
select one methylation proﬁle per individual, i.e., 75 proﬁles,
as follows: we pick the 67 proﬁles available at time t0 and,
in addition, the proﬁles of individuals not yet selected at t0
(because of absence of data) at the smallest time point as
