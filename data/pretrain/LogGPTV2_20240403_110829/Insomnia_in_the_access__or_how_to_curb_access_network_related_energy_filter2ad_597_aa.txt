ABSTRACT
Access networks include modems, home gateways, and DSL
Access Multiplexers (DSLAMs), and are responsible for 70-
80% of total network-based energy consumption.
In this
paper, we take an in-depth look at the problem of greening
access networks, identify root problems, and propose practi-
cal solutions for their user- and ISP-parts. On the user side,
the combination of continuous light traﬃc and lack of alter-
native paths condemns gateways to being powered most of
the time despite having Sleep-on-Idle (SoI) capabilities. To
address this, we introduce Broadband Hitch-Hiking (BH2),
that takes advantage of the overlap of wireless networks to
aggregate user traﬃc in as few gateways as possible.
In
current urban settings BH2 can power oﬀ 65-90% of gate-
ways. Powering oﬀ gateways permits the remaining ones to
synchronize at higher speeds due to reduced crosstalk from
having fewer active lines. Our tests reveal speedup up to
25%. On the ISP side, we propose introducing simple inex-
pensive switches at the distribution frame for batching active
lines to a subset of cards letting the remaining ones sleep.
Overall, our results show an 80% energy savings margin in
access networks. The combination of BH2 and switching
gets close to this margin, saving 66% on average.

INTRODUCTION
Recognizing the importance of improving the energy eﬃ-
ciency of the Information and Communication Technologies
(ICT)1, recent research eﬀorts focused on reducing the en-
ergy consumption of datacenters [2, 3, 4], networks [5, 6, 7],
and networked computers [8, 9, 10]. Out of the overall ICT
energy expenditure, around 37% goes to powering telecom-
munication infrastructures [11]. The annual energy con-
sumption ﬁgures reported by telecommunication companies
are indeed staggering — Telecom Italia 2.1 TWh [12], France
Telecom - Orange 3.7 TWh [13], Telefonica 4.5 TWh [14],
Verizon 9.9 TWh [15]. In this paper, we seek energy saving
opportunities in broadband access networks including: (i)
on the user side, modem, wireless Access Point (AP), and
router (hereafter collectively referred to as gateway), and
(ii) on the ISP side DSLAM modems and line cards. Access
networks consume 70-80% of the overall energy going into
powering wired networks [16]. The above devices, despite
being smaller than backbone/metro devices, are responsible
for a major share of this fraction, due to their sheer number
and high per bit consumption [17].
Insomnia at the user part. Like most ICT devices, ac-
cess network devices are not energy proportional [18], i.e.,
they consume close to maximum power even if only lightly
loaded. Until the long term vision of energy proportional
computing becomes reality, the most practical approach for
cutting down on energy consumption is to implement Sleep-
on-Idle (SoI) mechanisms which by now have become oblig-
atory [19]. Herein, however, access networks have a problem
that backbones and metro networks don’t have – they lack
alternative paths. This means that a household, or a small
oﬃce connecting through a single Digital Subscriber Line
(DSL) or cable connection can only power oﬀ its gateway
when there is absolutely no traﬃc to be sent or received.
This is possible when all terminal devices are powered oﬀ,
but highly unlikely if some of them are online, and especially
if the user is actively engaged.
Home gateways might take up to a minute to boot and
synchronize their modem with the DSLAM, so traﬃc in-
activity periods need to be suﬃciently long. However, it
is known [8, 10, 9], and we also demonstrate in Sec. 2, that
most usages of the Internet (including leaving a machine idle
1While the energy consumption attributed to ICT might be
smaller than in other areas like transportation, manufactur-
ing, etc., the ongoing exponential increase of Internet traﬃc
on one side [1], and the successful eﬀorts for reducing energy
consumption in other societal systems on the other, will only
increase the importance of greening ICT.

to maintain network presence) include at least some con-
tinuous light traﬃc that puts packets on the wire at time
intervals that are much shorter than this. The problem is
exacerbated by the fact that broadband connections typi-
cally serve multiple terminal devices like PCs, home enter-
tainment systems and smart-phones, any of which can be
injecting light, or not so light traﬃc.
Inﬂexibility at the ISP part. As shown in Fig. 1, the
individual copper twisted pairs of nearby DSL subscribers
are bundled in a common cable that travels all the way to
the ISP central or regional oﬃce where individual pairs split
again and terminate on the Main Distribution Frame (MDF)
from where short local connections bring them to the Han-
dover Distribution Frame (HDF) and ultimately to the ISP
terminating modems. Each modem occupies a port in a line
card and multiple line cards are controlled by a DSLAM. The
insomniac state of the user part implies that ISP modems
and line cards cannot sleep either. Later in the paper we will
show that it is possible to put a large percentage of gateways
to sleep yielding substantial energy savings for users. This
implies that an equal percentage of ISP modems can also
be powered oﬀ through SoI. The total energy gains however
for an ISP are rather small. The reason is that a single ISP
modem consumes around 1 W whereas the shared circuitry
of the line card that hosts it consumes at least about 100 W.
Line cards, however, are unlikely to sleep, even if they em-
ploy SoI. This is due to the inﬂexibility in terms of lack of
switching capability at the HDF that permits a single active
port to keep a card with 12-72 ports awake.
Our contributions and results. Our main contribution
is a rigorous quantiﬁcation of energy saving margins in ac-
cess networks, and a breakdown of the gains between user
and ISP parts. Overall, using a combination of trace-driven
simulation and system prototype deployment (Sec. 5), we
demonstrate that there exists an 80% energy saving mar-
gin at access networks. Straightforward techniques that do
not require any expensive substitution of equipment can get
close to this margin and save 66% of the current consump-
tion. This will hopefully serve as a call to arms for ISPs and
users to oﬀer and use techniques in the spirit of those that
we developed for demonstrating the claimed margins. Our
speciﬁc technical contributions include the following:
• Traﬃc aggregation: We show that by aggregating user
traﬃc to a minimum number of gateways it is possible to
overcome the lack of alternative paths and the continuous
light traﬃc problems and save up to 72% of the energy con-
sumed by individual users without negatively impacting on
their QoS. To demonstrate this, we introduce Broadband
Hitch-Hiking (BH2), a distributed algorithm implemented in
the driver of wireless home devices (Sec. 3). In dense urban
areas where most users are, BH2 permits devices to direct
their light traﬃc to neighboring gateways within range, thus
letting the local gateway to power oﬀ through SoI.
• Impact on crosstalk2: Apart from energy savings, BH2
yields an additional – surprising – “bonus” for QoS. Owing to
the broadband lines being powered oﬀ by BH2, the remain-
ing copper twisted pairs on the common cable connecting
users to an ISP oﬃce are able to achieve higher data rates
due to reduced crosstalk [20] (Sec. 6). Our detailed exper-
iments using an Alcatel DSLAM with 24 VDSL2 modems
and cable lengths from 50 up to 600 m show substantial
gains – having half of the lines powered oﬀ gives the remain-
ing ones a speedup of around 15% whereas powering oﬀ 75%
of the lines increases the speedup to 25%.
• Line switching: Going over to the ISP side, we show that
the probability of a line card powering oﬀ using SoI decreases
exponentially with the number of modems it carries (Sec. 4).
We propose solving this problem using switches at the HDF
for terminating lines at diﬀerent DSLAM ports depending
on their state (active/inactive). We develop a model for
deciding how large a switch needs to be and obtain the very
positive result that even tiny 8×8 switches (8 DSL lines
being able to rearrange between a ﬁxed set of 8 ports on
diﬀerent line cards) permit batching together the active lines
to a minimum number of line cards, letting the remaining
ones sleep. Our experiments show that these simple switches
allow us to power oﬀ a percentage of line cards that tracks
well the percentage of gateways that BH2 can power oﬀ.
Putting it all together, simple aggregation at the user part
and switching at the ISP part can save 66% of total en-
ergy consumed in access networks. Extrapolating to all DSL
users world-wide, assuming comparable link utilizations and
wireless gateway density that we observe, the savings collec-
tively amount to about 33 TWh per year, comparable to the
output of 3 nuclear power plants in the US or equivalent to
half of the energy used by US datacenters in 20063.
2. CHALLENGES IN GREENING ACCESS
NETWORKS
DSL is the most widely deployed broadband access net-
work technology (58% of broadband subscriptions as of June
2010 in OECD countries [22]). DSL works on top of ordi-
nary twisted copper pairs used originally for telephony. DSL
enables digital transmission between a modem at the user’s
premises and a second modem at the ISP (Fig. 1).
ISP
modems reside inside a DSL Access Multiplexer (DSLAM)
which contains one such device for each serviced phone line.
Similar to IP routers, a DSLAM is often designed as a shelf
supporting a number of slots for line cards. A DSL line
card typically services 12 to 72 lines. Since DSL is by far
the most widespread access technology connecting over 320
million subscribers world-wide [21], and the one for which
we have extensive datasets, we will focus our study around
it. Notice, however, that our proposed techniques operate
one level above the component level so they are applicable
to other technologies as well. Next, we look at the reasons
behind the high energy consumption of access networks.
2.1 Huge number of devices
The access is the only part of the network where there
exists a direct proportionality between the number of net-

lines packed closely in the same cable bundle.

scriber has its own gateway and modem whereas a second
modem is terminating every customer line at the DSLAM.
Individual DSLAMs, despite servicing up to few thousands
customers, are still by far the most numerous shared de-
vice of a network. In [16], it is shown that the number of
DSLAMs is at least one order of magnitude more than metro
devices and two orders of magnitude more than core devices.
2.2 Very high energy consumption per bit
Due to their sheer number, access devices need to be as
cheap as possible. This requirement has an impact on sev-
eral aspects including their eﬃciency in terms of energy con-
sumption. Due to lack of energy proportionality [18], the
lowest energy consumption per bit transmitted is achieved
when a device is fully utilized. Using data sheets for diﬀerent
devices, researchers have computed the ratio of maximum
transmission capacity to maximum energy consumption and
reported the per bit consumption of devices at the diﬀerent
levels of a network [6, 17, 23]. From these reports it is clear
that access devices consume two to three orders of magni-
tude more energy per bit transmitted than core devices.
2.3 Poor statistical multiplexing
Access devices not only have higher per bit consumption
than other network devices under full load but have even
worse per bit consumption under typical load. This is due
to the fact that dedicated access devices are typically much
less utilized than shared core devices (while always consum-
ing close to maximum power [18]). Take for example an
ADSL line.
Its utilization depends almost exclusively on
the behavior of a single customer (whether an individual or
a family). Therefore, the amount of statistical multiplexing
achieved is much lower than in higher levels of the network,
e.g., in an access or a core router. To get an idea of the level
of utilization of typical ADSL lines, we plot in Fig. 2 the
median and the average utilization of a set of 10K ADSL
subscribers of a large commercial ISP providing subscrip-
tions with 1-20 Mbps downlink, and 256 Kbps to 1 Mbps
uplink. We observe a very low average utilization through-
out the day that does not exceed 9% even during the peak
hour as also noted by others [24, 25, 26]. Such levels of uti-
lization are smaller by a multiplicative factor than the level
of utilization of backbone links (typically 30-50%). This
makes the average per bit consumption of access devices yet
another multiplicative factor worse than their corresponding
per bit consumption under maximum load.
2.4 Failure of Sleep-on-Idle
The above mentioned low utilization should make access
devices a prime target for applying simple “Sleep-on-Idle”
(SoI) techniques that power oﬀ devices when there is no
traﬃc. Unfortunately, SoI is inhibited on access devices by
the following two problems. First, as noted earlier in the
access there exist no alternative wired paths. If a DSL line
is put to sleep, the customer is eﬀectively disconnected from
the network. Disconnection is ok as long as the customer
has no traﬃc to send or receive. This, however, brings us
to the second problem – “continuous light traﬃc”. We are
referring to low average rate traﬃc (see Fig. 2) that however
is constantly present as long as one or more terminal devices
are on. Gateways and modems might take up to a minute
to boot and synchronize and thus cannot sleep using SoI
