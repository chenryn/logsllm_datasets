1. General Project Information
Objectives
The main objective of our project is helping the travel industry to take full advantage of the
latest Internet technologies, i.e. Web services, Web processes, and semantics. In this context, we
are implementing a semantic architecture for dynamic packaging applications. The architecture
integrates tourism data systems in order to allow the creation of dynamic packages.
Main Deliverables
At the end of the project we expect to deliver the following items:
• Data Extraction System
• Data Model Mapping Application (Syntactic/Semantic)
• An Ontology for e-tourism
• Dynamic Packaging System
• Application for defining business rules for e-tourism
Scientific and Technical Coordinator
The project is coordinated by Jorge Cardoso, assistant professor at the University of Madeira,
and by Jorge Fernandes, administrator of Expedita, an organization whose main activity is the
development of systems for the tourism industry.
2. Partners Details
There are two main Partners in the project:
• The University of Madeira participates in the project through the Mathematics and
Engineering Department. The PI is Prof. Jorge Cardoso. Currently, 3 master students
(Miguel Gouveia, Jorge Sousa and Lisete Escórcio) and 3 senior students (Bruno Silva, Pedro
Rosa and Toni Rodrigues) are involved in the project. Past contributors included Tobias
Schmeing, from the University of Essen – Germany.
• Expedita – Arquitectura e Gestão de Sistemas de Informação Lda. is an IT organization that
develops several projects for the tourism industry. The company participates in the project
through is administrator, Jorge Fernandes. He is the co-PI of the project.
3. WorkPlan Overview
The workplan for the project is divided into five sections. This division is necessary because five
different teams are developing five different parts of the project.

4. Deliverables
The architecture will be composed by components that can be grouped into packages to
possibly be used and installed individually:
• Data Extractor: Component that allows the dynamic integration of different information
sources and channel data. Besides handling different data types, the component is able
to manage data sources, connect to remote and local data sources, knows how, and
where, to get specific information, respond to data retrieval queries and handle queries
and exceptions. In the global architecture, it has the responsibility to retrieve the
information that is in the tourism systems and that is requested to build the dynamic
packages.
• Data Model Mapping: Implements a user-friendly interactive mapping tool that allows
users to map syntactic data in a XML format to concepts of an OWL ontology. In the
context of the global architecture, this component must generate mapping rules that,
once defined, allow converting any XML structure to instances of a global shared data
ontological model.

SEED Report, for Semantic Web FactBook, by Cardoso, Fernandes
• Ontology for e-tourism: An ontology that defines the concepts that are present in the e-
tourism domain. The ontology will be developed by taking in consideration the
traveler’s point of view. It defines the global shared data model for the architecture and
will be used in the integration of the different information sources and in the definition
of packaging rules.
• Semantic Rules: A component that allows the definition of rules based on a specific
ontology. It will include an engine to validate and manage rules. It is used in the
dynamic package architecture to define the rules for the creation of dynamic packages.
Using this component, we can separate dynamic packaging logic from dynamic
packaging applications.
• Dynamic package system: The final system, composed by all the components that are
necessary to create the dynamic packaging system. It has the responsibility of
integrating all the other components and guarantee that processes are executed in order
to build the dynamic packages.

SEED Report, for Semantic Web FactBook, by Cardoso, Fernandes
• Data Extractor: A tool to extract information for different data sources and integrate
them trough XML Schemas and OWL representing a specific domain model. It can
respond to queries based in the XML Schemas and returns information respecting the
same data schemas.
• Data Model Mapping: A tool for mapping XML data to OWL data. Returns a XSD
document that defines the transformation of XML data to OWL data. This tool allows
storing the mapping rules for future editing.
• Ontology for e-tourism: An ontology that defines the concepts presented in the e-
tourism domain.
• Semantic Rules: A tool to define and manage semantic rules.
• Dynamic Package Application: A system for creating dynamic packages. The packages
are created using the information of data sources integrated in the system, by an
ontology for the e-tourism and by specific rules defined using the ontology concepts.
All these tools will be freely available in the SEED Web site: http://seed.expedita.com.pt/.
Besides these tools, the SEED Web site contains a lot of useful information related to the project,
such as work plans, the technology that is being used, analyses of similar systems, problems
and rational about the decisions taken, etc.
