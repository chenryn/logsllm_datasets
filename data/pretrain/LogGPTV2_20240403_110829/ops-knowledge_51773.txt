User: I just finished my second year as a university CS student, so my "real-world" knowledge is lacking.  I learned Java my first year, continued with Java and picked up C and simple Bash 
scripting my second.  This summer I'm trying to learn Perl (God help me).  I've dabbled with Python a bit in the past.
My question is, now that we have very readable, very writable scripting languages like Python, Ruby, Perl, etc, why does anyone write Bash scripts?  Is there something I'm missing?  I know my linux box has perl and python.  Are they not ubiquitous enough?  Is there really something
that's easier to do in Bash than in some other hll?
Assistant: As mentioned, the GNU tools are great, and are easiest to use within the shell. It is especially nice if your data is already in a linear or tabular form of plain text. Just as an example, the other day I was able to build a script to create an XHTML word cloud of any text file in 8 lines of Bourne Shell, which is even less powerful (but more widely supported) than Bash.
