Under #18262 a `FutureWarning` was added suggesting that existing code like
this:
    pd.DataFrame.from_items(x)
Should be changed to this:
    import collections
    pd.DataFrame.from_dict(collections.OrderedDict(x))
The fact that `from_items()` appeared only 6 times (now 8 times) in a Stack
Overflow search was used as partial justification for removing it. But if you
search on GitHub, `pd.DataFrame.from_items()` appears more than 15,000 times
in Python--almost half as many as `from_records()`!
We should celebrate the fact that this function doesn't cause enough confusion
to appear often on Stack Overflow. But it does occur (a lot!) in real code,
and deprecating it is a mistake.
If constructing a temporary `OrderedDict` around items is the best way to
construct a DataFrame, Pandas should implement that as a short function called
`DataFrame.from_items()`, rather than asking thousands of people to busy
themselves to accommodate this unnecessary API change.
I recommend removing the FutureWarning, and retaining this widely-used,
longstanding function.
For reference, the `FutureWarning` starts in 0.23 and looks like this:
> FutureWarning: from_items is deprecated. Please use
> DataFrame.from_dict(dict(items), ...) instead.
> DataFrame.from_dict(OrderedDict(items)) may be used to preserve the key
> order.
