ABSTRACT
A thorough understanding of the network impact of emerging large-
scale distributed systems – where trafﬁc ﬂows and what it costs –
must encompass users’ behavior, the trafﬁc they generate and the
topology over which that trafﬁc ﬂows. In the case of BitTorrent,
however, previous studies have been limited by narrow perspectives
that restrict such analysis.
This paper presents a comprehensive view of BitTorrent, using
data from a representative set of 500,000 users sampled over a
two year period, located in 169 countries and 3,150 networks.
This unique perspective captures unseen trends and reveals sev-
eral unexpected features of the largest peer-to-peer system. For
instance, over the past year total BitTorrent trafﬁc has increased by
12%, driven by 25% increases in per-peer hourly download volume
despite a 10% decrease in the average number of online peers.
We also observe stronger diurnal usage patterns and, surprisingly
given the bandwidth-intensive nature of the application, a close
alignment between these patterns and overall trafﬁc. Considering
the aggregated trafﬁc across access links, this has potential implica-
tions on BitTorrent-associated costs for Internet Service Providers
(ISPs). Using data from a transit ISP, we ﬁnd a disproportionately
large impact under a commonly used burstable (95th-percentile)
billing model. Last, when examining BitTorrent trafﬁc’s paths,
we ﬁnd that for over half its users, most network trafﬁc never
reaches large transit networks, but is instead carried by small transit
ISPs. This raises questions on the effectiveness of most in-network
monitoring systems to capture trends on peer-to-peer trafﬁc and
further motivates our approach.

INTRODUCTION
The network impact of popular, widely distributed services
has implications for capacity planning, trafﬁc engineering, and
interdomain business relationships. Accurately characterizing and
understanding this impact requires a view of the service in question
that includes not only the trafﬁc it generates and the networks it
traverses, but also the underlying user behaviors that drive it. Such
a comprehensive view is typically impossible to capture from any
single network or in-network monitoring system.
It comes as no surprise, then, that the overall impact of Bit-
Torrent, arguably the most widely distributed peer-to-peer system,
remains unknown.
In this paper, we present
the ﬁrst comprehensive study of
BitTorrent based on a longitudinal, representative view from the
network edge, including two years of application traces from over
500,000 user IPs located in 3,150 ASes and 169 countries.
Our study reveals BitTorrent usage trends and trafﬁc patterns that
have been previously hidden or obscured by limited perspectives.
After demonstrating the representativeness of our dataset as a
sample of the overall BitTorrent system (Sec. 3), we discuss trends
regarding how users interact with the system. We ﬁnd that while
the number of concurrent active users has decreased since 2008,
the overall volume of trafﬁc that BitTorrent generates has grown by
12%, likely due in part to increased bandwidth capacities. While
session times have also decreased over this period (by 21%), the
temporal patterns behind these sessions are increasingly aligned
with those of rest of Internet trafﬁc, despite BitTorrent’s known
high-bandwidth demands. This shift in usage patterns suggests an
increasing role for BitTorrent on ISPs’ infrastructure and costs.
After describing key trends regarding how BitTorrent is being
used, we then focus on where the corresponding trafﬁc is ﬂowing.
We leverage hundreds of millions of traceroute measurements
between peers to map the vast majority (89%) of BitTorrent trafﬁc
to the networks it traverses. Our analysis reveals that the trafﬁc
surprisingly exhibits signiﬁcant locality across geography (32%
of BitTorrent trafﬁc stays in the country of origin) and networks
(49% of trafﬁc is intradomain or crosses a single peering or
sibling AS link). Using a recent network classiﬁcation scheme,
we unexpectedly ﬁnd that most trafﬁc does not reach the core
of the network. Among other points, this raises questions on
110the effectiveness of in-network monitoring approaches to capture
trends on BitTorrent trafﬁc and further motivates our approach.
Using information about where BitTorrent trafﬁc is ﬂowing and
when it is generated, we model its contribution to ISPs’ costs. We
observe that, under the 95th-percentile billing model typically used
between transit ISPs and their customers, the time at which trafﬁc
occurs can be as important as the volume of trafﬁc. Incorporating
trafﬁc volumes from a large, global ISP, using this cost model, we
ﬁnd that current time-of-day patterns of BitTorrent often result in
signiﬁcantly higher cost, byte-for-byte, when compared to other
trafﬁc on the network.
In sum, our results highlight how limited perspectives for ana-
lyzing Internet-wide systems do not generalize, demonstrating the
need for comprehensive views when analyzing global features of
such widely distributed systems. One application of our analyses is
enabling ISPs to better understand the impact of such systems and
reason about the effects of alternative trafﬁc management policies.
2. BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK
P2P systems have received much attention from operators and
the research community due in part to their widespread popularity
and their potential network impact. Among P2P systems, BitTor-
rent is the most popular one, potentially accounting for between
20% and 57% of P2P ﬁle-sharing trafﬁc [17, 22]. A number
of studies provide detailed summaries of the BitTorrent protocol,
conventions and dynamics [11, 12, 19, 20]. In this paper, we focus
on data connections between peers, the ﬂows they generate, the
network paths they traverse and their temporal characteristics.
Numerous studies have analyzed P2P usage trends and attempted
to characterize the overall network impact from various perspec-
tives based on either simulations or limited perspectives [14,15,17,
21, 22, 25]. Conclusions vary considerably among studies, due in
part to variations in P2P usage in each ISP and the challenges with
identifying P2P trafﬁc from network ﬂow summaries (e.g., due to
randomized ports or use of connection encryption). Our study is the
ﬁrst to examine the network impact of the BitTorrent P2P system,
based on the perspective of a set of users distributed over several
thousand networks worldwide. Since these traces are gathered from
within the application, they are not subject to classiﬁcation errors.
Given the potential impact of P2P-associated cross-ISP trafﬁc
on network operational costs, several studies have investigated
approaches to evaluate and improve P2P trafﬁc’s locality [5, 6,
13, 16, 18, 30]. Xie et al. [30] base their results on testbed
evaluations in a small number of ISPs, Piatek et al. [18] use a single
vantage point outside of classical research platforms, and Cuevas
et al. [6] simulate peer interactions based on information derived
from tracker scrape results. As in some of our previous work [5],
we rely instead on a global view and actual BitTorrent connections
to evaluate locality aspects of this system. Here we move beyond
coarse-grained locality analysis in an attempt to understand the cost
associated with BitTorrent trafﬁc using a detailed Internet map that
combines public BGP feeds with peer-based traceroute data [3]. As
we demonstrate in Section 5.1, network paths collected from end-
users are indispensable to determine the path that BitTorrent trafﬁc
takes through the network.
Understanding how P2P-associated trafﬁc affects an ISP’s tran-
sit charges is important for determining subscriber charges and
informing trafﬁc engineering policies. Following the approach
used by Stanojevic et al. [23] (which examined the cost impact of
individual ISP subscribers’ trafﬁc), we are the ﬁrst to apply the
game-theoretic Shapley analysis to examine the relative cost of
interdomain BitTorrent trafﬁc under the common 95th-percentile
charging model.
3. DATASETS
We now describe the traces we use in the rest of this study.
We posit that this dataset comprises the ﬁrst comprehensive and
representative view of BitTorrent.
The following paragraphs
demonstrate each of these properties in turn.
3.1 A Comprehensive View of BitTorrent
Our study is based on the largest collection of detailed end-
user traces from a P2P system. Speciﬁcally, we use data gathered
through users of the AquaLab’s ongoing Ono [5] and NEWS [4]
projects, our vantage points (VP), collectively representing more
than 1,260,000 installations. Our data collection software, im-
plemented as extensions to the Vuze BitTorrent client [28], peri-
odically report application and network statistics, excluding any
information that can identify the downloaded content.1 This dataset
is comprehensive in that it is longitudinal across time and covers a
broad range of networks and geographic regions.
To inform BitTorrent usage trends during the past year (Sec. 4),
we use data from the second week of November 2008 and every
two months from November 2009 through November 2010 (about
1 TB of trace data). For our detailed study of BitTorrent trafﬁc,
we use continuous data from March through May 2010 (Secs. 5-6).
Altogether, our dataset includes traces from more than 500,000 IPs
located in 3,150 ASes and 169 countries.
This dataset includes per-connection transfer data, such as source
and destination (our vantage points and the peers they connect to),
current transfer rates at 30-second intervals, and the cumulative
volume of data transferred in each direction for each connection.
It also allows us to compute user session time, i.e.
the length of
time that a user runs BitTorrent.
In addition to passively gathered data,
the dataset contains
traceroutes to a subset of peers connected to each vantage point.
Targets for the probes are selected at random from connected peers,
and at most one traceroute is performed at a time (to limit probing
overhead). Each measurement is performed using the host’s built-in
traceroute command. From March through May 2010, our dataset
comprises 202 million traceroute measurements. In Sec. 5.1, we
discuss how we use these measurements to map per-connection
ﬂows to the AS paths they traverse.
3.2 Representativeness
We now analyze the representativeness of our dataset as a sample
of activity in the Internet-wide BitTorrent system. While the
vantage points are limited by the set of users who voluntarily
install our extensions, we do not expect to ﬁnd any strong platform
or language-speciﬁc bias that could impact our results. The
Vuze BitTorrent client, as well as our two instrumented plugins,
run on all major platforms and are translated into nearly every
language. There are several other potential sources of bias such as
extension-speciﬁc behavior and the distribution of vantage points
in terms of geography and networks, the peers they connect to,
and the BitTorrent clients those peers use. We address these in
the following paragraphs.
We ﬁrst account for bias introduced by the extensions that our
VPs run. While NEWS uses BitTorrent trafﬁc to detect service-
level network events without affecting the application, Ono biases
peer selection using CDN redirections to reduce cross-ISP trafﬁc.
We avoid this bias by ﬁltering out all data for connections that Ono
selected for preferred peering.
