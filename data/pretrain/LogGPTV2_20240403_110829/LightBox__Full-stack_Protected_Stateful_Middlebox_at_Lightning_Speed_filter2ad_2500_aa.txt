ABSTRACT
Running o(cid:130)-site so(cid:137)ware middleboxes at third-party service providers
has been a popular practice. However, routing large volumes of
raw tra(cid:129)c, which may carry sensitive information, to a remote
site for processing raises severe security concerns. Prior solutions
o(cid:137)en abstract away important factors pertinent to real-world de-
ployment. In particular, they overlook the signi(cid:128)cance of metadata
protection and stateful processing. Unprotected tra(cid:129)c metadata
like low-level headers, size and count, can be exploited to learn
supposedly encrypted application contents. Meanwhile, tracking
the states of 100,000s of (cid:131)ows concurrently is o(cid:137)en indispensable
in production-level middleboxes deployed at real networks.
We present LightBox, the (cid:128)rst system that can drive o(cid:130)-site mid-
dleboxes at near-native speed with stateful processing and the most
comprehensive protection to date. Built upon commodity trusted
hardware, Intel SGX, LightBox is the product of our systematic
investigation of how to overcome the inherent limitations of secure
enclaves using domain knowledge and customization. First, we in-
troduce an elegant virtual network interface that allows convenient
access to fully protected packets at line rate without leaving the
enclave, as if from the trusted source network. Second, we provide
complete (cid:131)ow state management for e(cid:129)cient stateful processing,
by tailoring a set of data structures and algorithms optimized for
the highly constrained enclave space. Extensive evaluations demon-
strate that LightBox, with all security bene(cid:128)ts, can achieve 10Gbps
packet I/O, and that with case studies on three stateful middleboxes,
it can operate at near-native speed.

1 INTRODUCTION
Middleboxes underpin the infrastructure of modern networks, where
they undertake critical network functions for performance, connec-
tivity, and security [90]. Recently, a paradigm shi(cid:137) of migrating
so(cid:137)ware middleboxes (aka virtual network functions) to profes-
sional service providers, e.g., public cloud, is taking place for the
promising security, scalability and management bene(cid:128)ts [8, 30, 76].
Its potential to enable a billion-dollar marketplace has already been
widely recognized [21].
According to Zscaler [39], petabytes of tra(cid:129)c are now routed to
its cloud-based security platform for middlebox processing every
single day, and the number is still growing. Along with this seem-
ingly unstoppable momentum comes an unprecedented security
concern: how can end users be assured that their private informa-
tion buried in the huge volumes of tra(cid:129)c, is not unauthorizedly
leaked while being processed by the service provider (Fig. 1)? We
are witnessing increasing and diversifying data breaches by service
providers nowadays [53], yet embarrassingly we are also facing a
daunting situation where full-scale tra(cid:129)c inspection seems manda-
tory to thwart stealthy threats [40]. In light of this, a reassuring
solution should be capable of protecting sensitive tra(cid:129)c while re-
taining necessary middlebox functionality.
Over the past few years, a number of approaches have been pro-
posed to address the problem above, and they can be categorized
into two broadly de(cid:128)ned classes: so(cid:135)ware-centric and hardware-
assisted. (cid:140)e (cid:128)rst line of solutions [3, 10, 26, 51, 77, 99] o(cid:137)en rely
on tailored cryptographic schemes. (cid:140)ey are advantageous in pro-
viding provable security without hardware assumption, but o(cid:137)en
limited in functionality and sometimes in performance. (cid:140)e sec-
ond line of solutions move middleboxes into a trusted execution
environment, mostly Intel SGX enclave [56]. Hardware-assisted
designs provide generally be(cid:138)er functionality and performance
than so(cid:137)ware-centric approaches. In this regard, e(cid:130)orts with par-
ticular focus on the modular design and programmability of secure
middleboxes [18, 35, 66, 86], deployment consideration [61], and
code protection [66] have been actively made.
As with these designs, we prioritize the consideration of handling
the intrinsic complexity and stringent performance requirements
of middleboxes, and leverage the SGX enclave as a starting point to
develop a secure middlebox system. We observe that while previous
solutions have claimed the bene(cid:128)ts and practicality of SGX-enabled
design, they largely overlooked several key factors that are highly
pertinent to the real-world deployment of o(cid:130)-site middleboxes. We
have identi(cid:128)ed two important aspects and provided encouraging
