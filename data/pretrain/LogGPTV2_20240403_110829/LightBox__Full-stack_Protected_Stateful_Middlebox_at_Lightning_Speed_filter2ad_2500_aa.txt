## Abstract
Off-site software middleboxes are commonly deployed at third-party service providers. However, routing large volumes of potentially sensitive traffic to a remote site for processing raises significant security concerns. Previous solutions often abstract away important factors relevant to real-world deployment, particularly metadata protection and stateful processing. Unprotected traffic metadata, such as low-level headers, size, and count, can be exploited to infer encrypted application contents. Additionally, tracking the states of tens of thousands of flows concurrently is essential in production-level middleboxes.

We introduce LightBox, the first system that can drive off-site middleboxes at near-native speed with stateful processing and comprehensive protection. Built on commodity trusted hardware, Intel SGX, LightBox leverages domain knowledge and customization to overcome the inherent limitations of secure enclaves. First, we present an elegant virtual network interface that allows convenient access to fully protected packets at line rate without leaving the enclave, as if from a trusted source network. Second, we provide complete flow state management for efficient stateful processing, using data structures and algorithms optimized for the constrained enclave space. Extensive evaluations show that LightBox, with all its security benefits, can achieve 10Gbps packet I/O and operate at near-native speed in three case studies of stateful middleboxes.

## 1 Introduction
Middleboxes form the backbone of modern networks, providing critical functions for performance, connectivity, and security [90]. Recently, there has been a shift towards migrating software middleboxes (virtual network functions) to professional service providers, such as public clouds, for their security, scalability, and management benefits [8, 30, 76]. This trend has the potential to create a billion-dollar marketplace [21].

According to Zscaler [39], petabytes of traffic are now routed to cloud-based security platforms for middlebox processing every day, and this number is still growing. This trend raises unprecedented security concerns: how can end users be assured that their private information, buried in the vast amounts of traffic, is not unauthorizedly leaked while being processed by the service provider (Fig. 1)? Data breaches by service providers are increasing and diversifying [53], and full-scale traffic inspection seems mandatory to thwart stealthy threats [40]. Therefore, a reassuring solution should protect sensitive traffic while retaining necessary middlebox functionality.

Over the past few years, several approaches have been proposed to address these concerns, which can be categorized into two broad classes: software-centric and hardware-assisted. Software-centric solutions [3, 10, 26, 51, 77, 99] often rely on tailored cryptographic schemes. While they provide provable security without hardware assumptions, they are often limited in functionality and performance. Hardware-assisted solutions, primarily using Intel SGX enclaves [56], offer better functionality and performance. Efforts have been made to improve modular design and programmability [18, 35, 66, 86], deployment considerations [61], and code protection [66].

In our work, we prioritize handling the intrinsic complexity and stringent performance requirements of middleboxes, leveraging the SGX enclave as a starting point. We observe that while previous solutions have claimed the benefits and practicality of SGX-enabled designs, they largely overlook key factors pertinent to real-world deployment. We identify two important aspects and provide encouraging results.
