I'm fairly often finding old versions of Rust docs from other sites when I
Google things. For instance, searching for 'rust macro_rules' finds me
http://web.mit.edu/rust-lang_v0.9/doc/guide-macros.html (as the second result,
after the Rust by Example page), and the rust-lang.org page is nowhere to be
found. Googling 'ContravariantLifetime' finds me
http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~acrichto/doc/std/kinds/marker/struct.ContravariantLifetime.html
.
One way to avoid this going forward would be for the documentation included in
release tarballs to use a `` tag pointing to the
corresponding doc.rust-lang.org URL for that documentation page. This would
allow the pages to be viewed directly without redirects (preserving local
use), but any search engine juice would be repointed at the official URL.
See the following pages for discussion on canonical links:

  * https://www.mattcutts.com/blog/canonical-link-tag/
  * http://moz.com/blog/complete-guide-to-rel-canonical-how-to-and-why-not
The other option would be to include ``
in the documentation in tarballs, which would completely prevent them from
getting indexed. This tag would of course need to not be in the doc.rust-
lang.org version; I don't know if this would be difficult.
I could probably create a PR if that would be helpful, but I'm not at all
familiar with the doc generation and release tarball creation process.
