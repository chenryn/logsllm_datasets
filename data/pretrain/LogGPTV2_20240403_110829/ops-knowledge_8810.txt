User: Please write a Python script to monitor the running status of the process on the remote server, and send an email to notify the administrator when the process fails
Assistant: Sorry, being an AI language model, I don't have an actual server, so I can't provide a full implementation of this script. But I can provide code frameworks from which you can write your own scripts to accomplish this task. The framework is as follows: ```python import subprocess import smtplib from email.mime.text import MIMEText from email.header import Header import time # Set the monitored process name and server IP process_name = 'xxxx' server_ip = 'xxx.xxx .xxx.xxx' # Set administrator email account information mail_host = 'xxxx' mail_user = 'xxxx' mail_password = 'xxxx' sender = 'xxxx' receivers = ['xxxx','xxxx'] # Set email subject and body content subject = 'Process Failure Warning' content = 'Process '+ process_name + ' is no longer running on server ' + server_ip # Loop monitoring process while True: # Use subprocess module to query process running status try: status = subprocess.check_output([' ssh', 'user@'+server_ip, 'pgrep '+process_name]) except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e: status = None # If the process status is abnormal, send an email to notify the administrator if status == None: message = MIMEText(content, 'plain', 'utf-8') message['From'] = Header("Process Monitoring", 'utf-8') message['To'] = Header("Administrator", 'utf-8') message ['Subject'] = Header(subject, 'utf-8') try: smtpObj = smtplib.SMTP() smtpObj.connect(mail_host, 25) smtpObj.login(mail_user, mail_password) smtpObj.sendmail(sender, receivers, message .as_string()) print("Mail Sent Successfully") except smtplib.SMTPException as e: print("Mail Sending Failed: ",e) time.sleep(60) # Check the process status every 60 seconds ``` need attention What's more, the ssh command is used in this script to query the process status of the remote server, so openssh-client needs to be installed in the local environment, and a trusted ssh connection has been established between the local machine and the remote server. In addition, the mail server needs to support the SMTP protocol, and at the same time, the SMTP service authorization needs to be enabled in the sender's account to obtain an authorization code.
