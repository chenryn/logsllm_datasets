User:  How to perform load balancing after containerized deployment?
Assistant: In the containerized deployment scenario, load balancing can be performed in the following two ways: 1. Service grid load balancing: You can use the load balancing function provided by the service grid (such as Istio, Linkerd, etc.) to distribute traffic to containerized applications between different container instances of the program. 2. Load balancing based on container orchestration: Based on the built-in load balancing function of the container orchestration platform (such as Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, etc.), the traffic is distributed among different container instances, and it has the ability of automatic service discovery and load balancing. Whether you use service grid load balancing or container orchestration infrastructure load balancing, you need to configure an appropriate load balancing strategy to ensure good load balancing between container instances. For example: round robin, least connections, etc.
