I am pretty sure this is going to affect _any_ install from a git remote with
a ref that's not found in the origin. But I encountered it trying to install a
PR, and haven't investigated further.
Instead of "remote reference not found in git repository", or some other
helpful thing, it does this.
### Current Behavior:
Pacote fails with a git folder issue.
    $ npm i npm/pacote#pull/55
    npm ERR! code 128
    npm ERR! command failed
    npm ERR! command git clone --mirror -q ssh://PI:EMAIL/npm/pacote.git /Users/isaacs/.npm/_cacache/tmp/git-clone-00c3d7a2/.git
    npm ERR! fatal: destination path '/Users/isaacs/.npm/_cacache/tmp/git-clone-00c3d7a2/.git' already exists and is not an empty directory.
    npm ERR! A complete log of this run can be found in:
    npm ERR!     /Users/isaacs/.npm/_logs/2021-05-03T00_17_29_111Z-debug.log
### Expected Behavior:
Report that `pull/55` isn't a thing that exists in the npm/pacote repository.
### Environment:
macOS, npm 7.11.2
My bet is that this is a bug in either `pacote` or `@npmcli/git`, but I
haven't dug any further into it as yet.
