ABSTRACT
Networks not employing destination-side source address validation
(DSAV) expose themselves to a class of pernicious attacks which
could be easily prevented by ltering inbound trac purporting
to originate from within the network. In this work, we survey the
pervasiveness of networks vulnerable to inltration using spoofed
addresses internal to the network. We issue recursive Domain Name
System (DNS) queries to a large set of known DNS servers world-
wide, using various spoofed-source addresses. We classify roughly
half of the 62,000 networks (autonomous systems) we tested as
vulnerable to inltration due to lack of DSAV. As an illustration of
the dangers these networks expose themselves to, we demonstrate
the ability to ngerprint the operating systems of internal DNS
servers. Additionally, we identify nearly 4,000 DNS server instances
vulnerable to cache poisoning attacks due to insucient—and often
non-existent—source port randomization, a vulnerability widely
publicized 12 years ago.

address spoong creates a scenario in which inbound trac might
appear to be from a trusted party—even from another internal sys-
tem. If trac arriving at a given system has a source address that
originates from that system, the legitimacy of the trac should be
questioned. This is loosely analogous to a postal service deliver-
ing a letter to an address, with the letter claiming to be from that
address. Yet the source address of packets is often not checked—
allowing a spoofed-source packet to penetrate a network border
and reach systems not intended for public access. While the eects
of this penetration can be mitigated in some cases with protocols
that include some form of identity check (e.g., TCP), in other cases,
this inltration creates a vulnerability that can be exploited for
surveillance or compromise.
There are two signicant locations in the path of a spoofed-
source packet: 1) the border of the network from which it orig-
inates; and 2) the border of the network for which it is destined.
Network Ingress Filtering [20] 1—also known as Source Address
Validation (SAV) [2]—is the de facto solution for combating source
address spoong at packet origin, codied as Best Current Prac-
tice (BCP) 38 [20]. When spoofed-source packets are dropped as
they attempt to leave their Internet Service Provider (ISP), they
never become a presence in the Internet at large. However, once a
spoofed-source packet reaches its destination, determining its va-
lidity is much more dicult—that is, unless the packet has a source
IP address claiming to have originated from within the target net-
work. Just as an ISP can block outbound packets that claim to have
originated from outside, it can block inbound packets that claim to
have originated from inside. We refer to these actions, more specif-
ically, as origin-side SAV (OSAV) and destination-side SAV (DSAV),
respectively.
When DSAV is absent, a network is vulnerable to inltration—
masquerading as a network insider to penetrate a network border
and access internal resources. The rst major contribution of this
paper is a large-scale study of the lack of DSAV. In late 2019,
we surveyed 62,000 networks for DSAV, using methodology that
was eective in its detection, yet harmless. We sent spoofed-source
packets to these networks, each packet having a source appearing to
originate from the network for which it was destined. We observed
1Note that the term “ingress” is used not because the ltering happens as a packet
enters a network but because the ltering happens at the ingress (input) link of the
participating router.

that about half of the networks we surveyed lacked DSAV, allowing
our spoofed-source packets into their network.
Even more important than the fact that a network can be inl-
trated is the impact of the unauthorized access—how it might be
exploited to survey or compromise internal systems. The second ma-
jor contribution of this paper is an analysis of internal systems
reached via network inltration, as a case study motivating the
importance of DSAV. We characterize and assess the vulnerability
of systems accessed through experimental spoofed-source packets.
We accomplished this by issuing spoofed-source Domain Name Sys-
tem (DNS) queries to almost 12 million DNS servers. These queries
reached about 5% of targets, allowing us to survey over a half million
servers. Within the target networks lacking DSAV, we identied
nearly 4,000 DNS servers that were vulnerable to cache poisoning
attack, 59% of which would have been protected had DSAV been in
place. While untested as part of this work, networks lacking DSAV
also expose otherwise unreachable—and possibly vulnerable—DNS
resolvers to other attacks such as DNS zone poisoning [29] and the
recently disclosed NXNS attack [43].
2 BACKGROUND AND PREVIOUS WORK
BCP 38 [20] urges ISPs to deploy OSAV to prevent packets with
spoofed sources from leaving their networks. This containment
prevents these networks from being contributors to spoong-based
attacks, such as reection and intrusion. In a reection attack, an
attacker spoofs the address of a victim in the request to a server,
and the server sends its response to the victim, typically in another
network. Network intrusion occurs when a network with no OSAV
sends a spoofed-source packet to a network with no DSAV, and the
packet’s source matches IP prexes originated by its target network.
In this case, packets enter a network with a spoofed source that
appears to have originated from within the destination network.
The internal system receiving the spoofed-source packets will see
them as having originated internally.
Spoong-based reection and intrusion must be carried out with
an application-layer protocol, such as the DNS. The DNS is a query-
response protocol used for translating domain names to Internet re-
sources, such as IP addresses. Stub resolvers query recursive resolvers
(or servers), which nd an answer by querying authoritative servers.
While authoritative DNS servers are typically open to queries from
any Internet entity, recursive servers are traditionally closed, only
allowing queries from known clients [10]. Open recursive servers
exist, but are discouraged (although public DNS services are becom-
ing more prevalent [8, 22, 23, 39, 45]). For this reason, authoritative
DNS services and open recursive DNS services are more likely to
be used in reection, whereas closed resolvers are the more likely
target for intrusion.
In the area of DNS-based reection attacks, researchers have
explored both attack potential [44] and the deployment of DNS
Response Rate Limiting (RRL) [12, 33, 34, 46].
With regard to SAV measurement, the Spoofer Project has been
involved in measuring SAV for over 10 years [2, 5, 32]. Spoofer data
comes from participants who voluntarily install and run the Spoofer
client on their machines. This client’s primary role is to send out
spoofed-source probes to test for OSAV. However, it also plays
a part in DSAV measurement. Spoofed-source packets appearing
to originate from the client’s network are sent to each client. If
the client receives the spoofed packet, Spoofer is able to infer the
lack of DSAV. Researchers recently reported a surprising 67% and
74% of the IPv4 and IPv6 autonomous systems (ASes) measured,
respectively, lacking DSAV [32].
Our approach addresses two limitations associated with Spoofer’s
DSAV measurement. First, a signicant portion of the Spoofer
clients are run behind Network Address Translation (NAT) gate-
ways, for which DSAV cannot be tested (i.e., because the client
has no public IP address from which it can be reached). Secondly,
Spoofer requires a user to opt in to the study by downloading and
running the client. Our methodology only targets public IP ad-
dresses on existing infrastructure, such that no client software is
required.
In work performed concurrently with (and independently of)
our own, Korczyński, et al. [30], tested networks for source address
validation using a methodology similar to ours. They issued queries
to every IP address in the IPv4 space, in each case spoong the
source IP address just higher than the selected destination. In con-
trast, our objectives focused on exploring the variety of ways in
which a lack of DSAV might be discovered. Our methodology diers
primarily in that 1) we use as many as 101 diverse, spoofed-source
IP addresses for each destination, rather than only the next sequen-
tial IP address; 2) the selection of target IP addresses used in our
research consist of those that generate query activity at the root
servers; and 3) our study includes both IPv4 and IPv6. Our results
show that there are advantages to both the current methodology
and that used by Korczyński, et al. In particular, the sheer breadth
of the IPv4 address space scanned by Korczyński, et al., resulted
in more overall hits than our targeted approach. The diversity of
spoofed sources used in our experiment uncovered resolvers—and
ASes—that would not have otherwise been identied using only a
same-prex source. We discuss this further in Section 4.1. Nonethe-
less, the overall percentage of measured ASes with reachable IPv4
targets is consistent between the two studies, within 1%: 48.78%
vs. 49.34%. Finally, in the current paper, we extend our analysis to
survey and identify vulnerabilities of internal systems, as a case
study of our methodology.
Related to our vulnerability analysis of internal DNS resolvers,
Scheer, et al. [42], analyzed internal DNS recursive servers using
a dierent technique. By communicating over the Simple Mail
Transfer Protocol (SMTP) with servers that performed Sender Policy
Framework (SPF) [28] validation, they were able to elicit queries
of the mail servers’ recursive DNS servers. Their results turned up
very little evidence of servers lacking source port randomization,
whereas our study shows a non-trivial number—nearly 4,000 DNS
resolvers with invariant source ports.
3 EXPERIMENT SETUP
Our DSAV experiment consisted of sending DNS queries with
spoofed-source IP addresses to millions of recursive DNS servers
world-wide. Our goal was to determine whether or not each query
reached its target DNS server, and thus penetrated the network bor-
der in the process. Having no observable presence at the addresses
we spoofed, we had no way of assessing reachability by examining
responses. Thus, we determined that a recursive DNS server was

reachable if, for a given query, we observed a corresponding query
at a DNS authoritative server—an indicator of the recursive server’s
attempt to resolve the query name. The query names used in our
experiment were such that 1) no query name would ever be found
in the cache of a DNS resolver and 2) the servers authoritative for all
queries are under our control (see Section 3.3). Figure 1 illustrates
our setup.
3.1 DNS Servers (Targets)
To generate a set of target IP addresses, we used the “Day in the
Life” (DITL) [16] data, sponsored by the DNS Operations, Analysis,
and Research Center (OARC) [17]. The DITL data consists of 48
hours of DNS queries destined for the DNS root servers, contributed
by members of the DNS operator community, including operators
of the DNS root servers [41]. Thus, it provides a rich source of
potential recursive DNS servers for our experiment. We extracted
the source IP addresses from the DNS queries captured in the 2019
