## 1. History
- **Porsche**: The first implementation of TPMS was on the 959 in 1986 (Source: Wikipedia).
- **Luxury Cars**: Various styles of TPMS were used in luxury vehicles.
- **TREAD Act**: The Firestone/Ford Explorer tire problems in the 1990s led to legislation mandating the use of TPMS.

## 2. TPMS Types
- **Direct TPMS**: Commonly used in most vehicles, can be battery-powered or battery-less.
- **Indirect TPMS**: Uses ABS and various calculations instead of a sensor.
- **Focus**: This discussion will focus on battery-powered Direct TPMS.

## 3. Direct TPMS Description
- **Sensors**: Typically 4 sensors (possibly 5 with a spare), mounted on the wheel behind the valve stem.
- **Receiver**: Built into the car, often collocated with keyless entry components.
- **Processing**: The car's ECU/PCM processes the information and responds accordingly.

## 4. Annoying TPMS Light
- The TPMS light is a common source of frustration for many drivers.

## 5. Sensor Description
- **Components**: Most sensors include an ASIC (microcontroller from Atmel, Freescale, Microchip, etc.), a pressure sensor, and RF components.
- **Location**: Usually part of the valve stem, sitting in a recessed area of the rim inside the tire.
- **RF Transmission**: Transmits in the 315MHz band (US) or 433MHz (EU).

## 6. Sensor Activation
- **Activation Methods**:
  - Rotation
  - Low-frequency transmission (125kHz, modulated or continuous)
  - Magnets
- **Transmission Frequency**: Typically once per minute, unless there’s a significant pressure variation, which triggers more frequent transmissions.
- **Retransmissions**: Overlapping transmissions may require retransmits.

## 7. Sensor Internals
- **Example**: Siemens VDO (used in Mazda 3, 6, or RX-8)
  - **Microprocessor**: Atmel AT092 (4-bit microprocessor)
  - **Pressure Sensor**: MEMS style
  - **RF Components**: Simple
  - **Battery**: CR2302
  - **Passive Components**: Assorted

## 8. Before...
- [Description of the state before the TPMS system was implemented or activated]

## 9. During...
- [Description of the process during the TPMS system activation or operation]

## 10. After...
- [Description of the state after the TPMS system has been implemented or activated]

## 11. And then...
- **Discovery**: 
  - **FCC ID Lookup**: Visit [FCC website](http://www.fcc.gov/oet/ea/fccid/) and enter the Grantee & Product code to find detailed testing documents.

## 12. FCC Testing Documents
- **Contents**:
  - Spectrum Analyzer output
  - General description of operation
  - Bill of materials
  - Other relevant details

## 13. Finding FCC IDs
- **eBay**: A useful platform for finding and purchasing TPMS sensors and related components.

## 14. Receiver Description
- **Location**: Typically in the trunk or behind the glove box.
- **Capacity**: Can remember 4-10 sensors at once (e.g., summer and winter wheels).
- **Learning Mode**: Special tools or operations are required to put the receiver in "Learning Mode."

## 15. Sensor RF Details
- **Example**: Siemens VDO FE01-37140
  - **Transmission**: Combination of ASK/FSK
  - **Wakeup Signal**: 12 pulses of ASK
  - **Data Transmission**: 3 pulses of FSK containing actual sensor data
  - **Frequency**: Once per minute over 20mph, or every 5 seconds if there is a pressure problem

## 16. Sensor Transmission Details
- **Data Content**:
  - Pressure level
  - Battery level
  - Sensor ID (to identify each wheel)
- **ID Precision**: Usually 32-108 bits, encoded but unencrypted.
- **Identification**: With 4-5 sensors per car, it’s easy to identify a car by its tires alone.

## 17. Dealer / Tire Repair Shop Tools
- **Universal Tools**: Cost $150-$3000
  - **Features**:
    - Generate 125kHz signals to activate most TPMS
    - Include a magnet to activate older sensors
    - Decode transmissions based on make, model, year, etc.
    - Indicate reception of signal

## 18. DIY Tools
- **Motivation**: Avoid overpaying for commercial tools.
- **Applications**: Practical and nefarious purposes.
- **Components**: Based on commodity parts.

## 19. DIY Receiver
- **Components**:
  - RF receiver element (C1110, Microchip options, etc.)
  - Arduino for simplicity
  - LCD Display (optional)
  - Magnet & 125kHz transmitter
  - Open-source and database for transmission methods

## 20. Using Receiver
- **Functionality**:
  - Store multiple IDs
  - Useful for CarPCs in vehicles with limited TPMS
  - Verify TPMS sensors
  - Walk around parking lots to get TPMS IDs of interesting vehicles

## 21. DIY Transmitter
- **Development Status**: Still in development
- **Purpose**: Not a real TPM sensor, but a spoofer
- **Components**:
  - RF Transmitter element
  - Arduino for simplicity
  - Open-source and database of transmission methods

## 22. Using Transmitter
- **Applications**:
  - Send expected TPMS IDs for wheels that cannot accept TPM sensors
  - Send spoofed messages to confuse the ECU (e.g., low pressure, high pressure)
  - Near a stoplight, set up a sensor with a good antenna to grab IDs/formats of nearby TPM sensors
  - Set up a deal with nearby service stations/car dealers for a cut of tire-related services

## 23. More Ideas
- **Vehicle Tracking**: Set up a network of receivers tied to loggers at given locations to track interesting vehicles.
- **Fuzzing**: Start fuzzing the TPM formats to see what effects they have on various ECUs (potential remote exploits).

## 24. Future
- **Database Expansion**: Build out the database for TPM communication formats.
- **Single Device**: Develop a single device capable of acting in both send and receive configurations.
