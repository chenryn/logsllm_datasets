History
• Porsche - First implemented on the 959 in 
1986 (Thanks Wikipedia)
• A bunch of various styles used in luxury 
cars
• TREAD act - Basically, the Firestone / Ford 
Explorer problems in the 90’s instigated 
legislation mandating use

TPMS Types
• Direct - This is used in most vehicles
• Battery / Battery-less
• Indirect - Uses ABS and various calculations 
instead of a sensor
• Focus on battery-powered Direct TPMS

Direct TPMS 
Description
• Typically 4 sensors, possibly 5 w/ spare, 
mounted on wheel (behind the valve stem)
• Receiver is built into car, often collocated 
with the keyless entry components
• Car ECU / PCM processes info - behaves 
differently depending on car

 Annoying TPMS Light

Sensor Description
• Most are a combination of an ASIC (ie, a 
microcontroller - Atmel / Freescale / 
Microchip, etc), a pressure sensor, and some 
RF components
• Typically part of the valve stem and sits in a 
recessed area of the rim, inside the tire
• RF transmits in 315MHz band (US) or 
433MHz (EU)
6
Sensor Description
• Can be woken up by:
• Rotation
• Low frequency transmission (125kHz - 
modulated or continuous)
• Magnets
• Transmission system varies by manufacturer but is 
typically once per minute unless there’s a problem 
(meaning, signiﬁcant pressure variation)
• Transmissions can overlap, requiring retransmits
7
Sensor Internals
• Siemens VDO (From a Mazda 3, 6, or RX-8)
• Uses an ATMEL AT092 chip (4-bit microprocessor)
• A MEMS style pressure sensor
• Simple RF transmission components
• Battery (CR2302)
• Assorted passive components

• Spectrum Analyzer output
• General description of operation
• Often a build of materials
• etc...
• But how to ﬁnd all the FCC IDs?

Receiver Description
• Typically in trunk or behind glove box
• May have multiple receiver elements
• Receiver will typically remember 4-10 
sensors at once (summer, winter wheels)
• Most require special tools / operations to 
go in “Learning Mode”
16
Sensor RF Details
• Varies considerably based on sensor
• Using a Siemens VDO FE01-37140
• Uses a combination of ASK/FSK transmission
• 12 pulses of ASK “wakeup”
• 3 pulses of FSK transmission containing actual 
sensor data
• Repeats 1/min over 20mph, or every 5s with 
pressure problem
17
Sensor Transmission 
Details
• Each transmission consists of pressure level, 
battery level, and...
• A sensor ID (which exists to identify each wheel)
• BUT - the ID is usually way too precise - 32-108 
bits
• Encoded, but completely unencrypted
• Combine w/ 4-5 sensors per car and it’s very easy 
to identify a car by tires alone
18
Dealer / Tire Repair 
Shop Tools
• “Universal” tools - Cost from $150-$3000
• Can usually generate the 125kHz signals to 
activate most TPMS
• Often contain a special “tool”, aka a magnet, to 
activate older ones
• Upscale models will decode transmissions based 
on make, model, year, etc.
• Others simply indicate reception of signal
19
DIY Tools
• Didn’t want to overpay for ridiculous tools
• Some practical, some nefarious purposes
• Based on commodity parts
20
DIY Receiver
• Mostly complete
• RF receiver element (C1110, Microchip options, 
etc)
• Arduino for simplicity, but could be any given chip
• LCD Display (if needed)
• Magnet & 125kHz transmitter
• Open source & database for transmission methods
21
Using Receiver
• Can store multiple IDs
• Great for CarPCs for vehicles with limited 
TPMS (ie, RX8 says it’s low, but not which 
one or by how much)
• Easy way to verify TPMS sensors
• Walk around parking lot and get TPMS IDs 
of interesting vehicles
22
DIY Transmitter 
• Still in development
• Not really a TPM sensor, rather a spoofer
• RF Transmitter element
• Arduino again for simplicity, could be 
reduced to any given RF chip (ie, RFPIC)
• Also open & database of transmission
23
Using Transmitter...
• Certain wheels cannot accept TPM sensors.  Use 
transmitter to send expected TPMS IDs
• Get IDs then send spoofed messages confusing the 
ECU (ie, low pressure, high pressure, etc)
• Near a stoplight, setup a sensor with a good 
antenna to grab the IDs/Formats of TPM sensors 
nearby.  Setup deal with nearby service station / 
car dealer for cut of tire related services.  Send 
out spoofed messages...
24
More ideas...
• Setup a network of receivers tied to 
loggers at given locations and track 
interesting vehicles going nearby
• Start fuzzing the TPM formats and see what 
it does to various ECUs (Remote 
Exploit...?)
25
Future
• Need to drastically build out the database 
for TPM communication formats
• Ideally build a single device capable of acting 
in send / receive conﬁguration
