### The wording in the update docs is (emphasis added):
In a future version of pandas `pandas.concat()` will no longer sort the non-
concatenation axis when it is not already aligned. (...)
To keep the previous behavior (sorting) and silence the warning, pass
`sort=True`.  
**To accept the future behavior (no sorting), pass`sort=False`**

will-no-longer-sort
### But the wording in the `FutureWarning` messages is (emphasis added):
Sorting because non-concatenation axis is not aligned. A future version  
of pandas will change to not sort by default.
**To accept the future behavior, pass`sort=True`.**  
To retain the current behavior and silence the warning, pass `sort=False`

dev/pandas/blob/c4da79b5b322c73d8e61d1cb98ac4ab1e2438b40/pandas/core/indexes/api.py
It needs to be clearer that current default is still `sort=True` but will
revert to `sort=False` in a future version.
