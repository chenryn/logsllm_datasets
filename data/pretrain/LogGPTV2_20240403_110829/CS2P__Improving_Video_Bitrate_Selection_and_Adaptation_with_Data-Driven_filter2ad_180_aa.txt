ABSTRACT
Bitrate adaptation is critical
to ensure good quality-of-
experience (QoE) for Internet video. Several efforts have
argued that accurate throughput prediction can dramatically
improve the efﬁciency of (1) initial bitrate selection to lower
startup delay and offer high initial resolution and (2) mid-
stream bitrate adaptation for high QoE. However, prior ef-
forts did not systematically quantify real-world throughput
predictability or develop good prediction algorithms. To
bridge this gap, this paper makes three contributions. First,
we analyze the throughput characteristics in a dataset with
20M+ sessions. We ﬁnd: (a) Sessions sharing similar key
features (e.g., ISP, region) present similar initial throughput
values and dynamic patterns; (b) There is a natural “state-
ful” behavior in throughput variability within a given ses-
sion. Second, building on these insights, we develop CS2P,
a throughput prediction system which uses a data-driven ap-
proach to learn (a) clusters of similar sessions, (b) an ini-
tial throughput predictor, and (c) a Hidden-Markov-Model
based midstream predictor modeling the stateful evolution of
throughput. Third, we develop a prototype system and show
using trace-driven simulation and real-world experiments
that: (1) CS2P outperforms existing prediction approaches
by 40% and 50% in terms of the median prediction error
for initial and midstream throughput and (2) CS2P achieves
3.2% improvement on overall QoE and 10.9% higher aver-
age bitrate over state-of-art Model Predictive Control (MPC)
approach, which uses Harmonic Mean for throughput pre-
diction.

1 Introduction
There has been a dramatic rise in the volume of HTTP-based
adaptive video streaming trafﬁc in recent years [1]. De-
livering good application-level video quality-of-experience
(QoE) entails new metrics such as low buffering or smooth
bitrate delivery [5, 22]. To meet these new application-level
QoE goals, video players need intelligent bitrate selection
and adaptation algorithms [27, 30].
Recent work has shown that accurate throughput predic-
tion can signiﬁcantly improve the QoE for adaptive video
streaming (e.g., [47, 48, 50]). Speciﬁcally, accurate predic-
tion can help in two aspects:
• Initial bitrate selection: Throughput prediction can help
select a suitable initial bitrate when a video session starts.
Today’s video players either have to conservatively start
with a low bitrate and converge slowly to the optimal bi-
trate or alternatively incur high startup delay.
• Midstream bitrate adaptation: While it is possible to
develop adaptation approaches without using through-
put estimation (e.g., using only the playback buffer oc-
cupancy [27]), recent work [47] argues that throughput-
aware bitrate adaptation can deliver a better QoE than
pure buffer-occupancy based approaches.
Even though prior work [47, 50] suggests the potential
beneﬁts of throughput prediction, they fall short of providing
concrete prediction algorithms that achieve high accuracy
for real-world video sessions. Despite the rich measurement
literature in characterizing various Internet path properties
(e.g., [21,26,43]), our understanding of throughput variabil-
ity and predictability is quite limited.1
As a ﬁrst step to bridge this gap, we analyze intra- and
inter-session throughput predictability using a large dataset
from iQIYI [8], a leading commercial video provider in
China. We evaluate a range of proposed prediction ap-
proaches (e.g., [24, 28, 34, 41]) and ﬁnd that these prior ap-
proaches fail to meet the accuracy needed to deliver good

forts we are aware of are dated and limited in scope [17,49].
all QoE to >93% of ofﬂine optimal when combined with
MPC [47]. We also conduct pilot real-world experiments
using an open-source player [3] and deploy CS2P in the op-
erational platform of iQIYI. The results show that CS2P +
MPC improves overall QoE by 3.2% and average bitrate by
10.9% compared with the state-of-art HM (Harmonic Mean)
+ MPC strategy [47], and can accurately predict the total re-
buffering time at the beginning of the session.
Contributions and Roadmap: In summary,
makes three key contributions:
1. A large-scale analysis of throughput stability and pre-
dictability which highlights key challenges in predict-
ing the throughput accurately and suggests data-driven
insights that form the basis for our design (§3).
this paper
2. The CS2P architecture for improving bitrate selection
and adaptation via throughput modeling (§4) and a prac-
tical prediction framework that can capture the diverse
and stateful behaviors observed (§5).
3. A practical implementation in a video player (§6) and
the demonstration of the improvements in prediction ac-
curacy and QoE using trace-driven evaluations and pilot
deployments (§7).
We discuss related work in §8, before concluding in §9.
In the next section, we start by motivating the need for ac-
curate throughput prediction for bitrate selection and adap-
tation (§2).
2 Background and Motivation
We begin with a high-level overview of how HTTP-based
adaptive video streaming works and then highlight why we
need good throughput prediction.
Basics of HTTP-based bitrate adaptation:
In HTTP-
based video delivery, videos are typically segmented into
chunks and each chunk is encoded at different bitrate lev-
els. Chunks from different bitrate streams are aligned so that
the video player can smoothly switch to a different bitrate, if
necessary, at chunk boundaries.
The player uses bitrate selection and adaptation algo-
rithms that choose the bitrate levels for future chunks to de-
liver the highest possible QoE. Here, the adaptation algo-
rithm needs to balance multiple QoE considerations as dis-
cussed in prior work [15,16,22,47]. These include the initial
startup latency for the video to start playback, the amount
of rebuffering the user experiences during the session, the
average bitrate of the rendered video, and the smoothness
of the rendered video as measured by the number of bi-
trate switches. Since many of these requirements are in-
trinsically at odds with each other, the design of this adap-
tation algorithm is non-trivial and there has been consid-
erable interest in recent years in addressing this problem
(e.g., [22, 30, 31, 47]).
Need for better throughput prediction: Even though it is
possible to design adaptation strategies that avoid any form
of throughput prediction (e.g., [27]), accurate throughput
prediction can help in two aspects:
1. Initial bitrate selection: A video player should ideally
pick the highest initial bitrate that is sustainable (i.e., be-

QoE. In particular, we ﬁnd that these models are not expres-
sive enough to capture the diversity of real-world through-
put patterns (e.g., bottlenecks can occur everywhere along
the transmission path) and the dynamics of throughput evo-
lution within each session (e.g., simple models that use the
previous chunk throughputs are very noisy).
Our analysis also reveals two key insights that form the
basis for our proposed design. First, we observe that simi-
lar sessions (i.e., sessions sharing the same critical features
such as ISP, location) tend to have similar initial and average
throughput values and even exhibit similar structural prop-
erties in throughput variation. This resonates with the ﬁnd-
ings in recent work [29] that, at the application layer, simi-
lar sessions have similar video QoE performance. Second,
even though the observed throughputs for each video chunk
within a session are inherently noisy, they do exhibit natu-
ral stateful evolving behaviors. Speciﬁcally, we see that the
throughput is relatively stable and persistent for some dura-
tion of time but occasionally switches to a different state and
persists in the new state(s).
Building on these data-driven insights, we develop the
CS2P (Cross Session Stateful Predictor) approach for im-
proving bitrate selection and adaptation (Figure 1). CS2P
uses a data aggregator (called Prediction Engine) which
builds prediction models using observed throughputs from
past video sessions. This Prediction Engine uses an ofﬂine
clustering step to identify sessions that are likely to exhibit
similar throughput patterns. For each cluster, CS2P employs
a simple approach to predict initial throughput by using the
median throughput of the sessions in this cluster. To im-
prove midstream prediction, CS2P learns a Hidden-Markov-
Model (HMM) for each cluster to model the stateful evolu-
tion of intra-session throughput. The initial throughput and
midstream evolution models can then be plugged into the
bitrate selection and adaptation algorithms running either in
the video players [30,47] or content delivery servers [14,20].
In the broader design space of video delivery, CS2P can be
viewed as a middle ground between fully centralized con-
trol planes (e.g., C3 [23], CFA [29]) and fully decentralized
bitrate adaptation approaches (e.g., Buffer Based-BB [27],
FESTIVE [30], Model Predictive Control (MPC) [47]) as it
uses the centralized visibility to develop better throughput
prediction models but uses decentralized mechanisms to ex-
ecute the actual adaptation decisions.
Our trace-driven simulations show that CS2P outperforms
other throughput predictors and reduces the median predic-
tion error for initial and midstream throughput by 40% and
50% respectively. Moreover, CS2P can drive median over-

low the throughput). Existing approaches to initial bi-
trate selection without accurate throughput prediction,
however, are inefﬁcient. Table 1 shows anecdotal ev-
idence of such inefﬁciencies from several commercial
providers. By analyzing the performance of their players,
we categorize them into two main cases: (1) ﬁxed-bitrate
and (2) adaptive playback. Fixed-bitrate players that use
the same bitrate for the whole video session often inten-
tionally use low bitrate to prevent midstream rebuffer-
ing (e.g., NFL, Lynda). Even if bitrate can be adapted
midstream (e.g., [10, 27, 30]) the player may conserva-
tively start with a low bitrate and take a long time to reach
the optimal bitrate (e.g., Netﬂix). Furthermore, for short
video clips such adaptation may not reach the desired bi-
trate before the video ﬁnishes (e.g., Vevo music clips).2
Figure 2: Midstream QoE v.s. prediction accuracy. Ac-
tual QoE is normalized w.r.t. the theoretical optimal
achievable with perfect knowledge of future throughput.
2. Midstream adaptation: Good initial bitrate selection
by itself is not sufﬁcient as the network conditions may
change dynamically during the playback. Thus, most
players try to adapt the midstream bitrate as well. As
such, a good throughput predictor is a necessary com-
ponent of several prior proposals for bitrate adaptation
algorithms (e.g., [30,45,47]). To conﬁrm the importance
of accurate throughput prediction, we replicate the anal-
ysis performed by Yin et al. [47] to study the impact of
prediction error on the achieved QoE by Model Predic-
tive Control (MPC) based bitrate adaptation mechanism.
2Other providers (e.g., YouTube) are anecdotally also ob-
served to use information from the previous sessions of the
same client.
Figure 2 shows the variation of normalized QoE3 with
the increase of throughput prediction error. The result
shows that when the error is ≤20%, the n-QoE of MPC
is close to optimal (>85%). We also reconﬁrmed their
results that in this regime the performance can be signiﬁ-
cantly better than pure Buffer-Based adaptation approach
(i.e., BB in Figure 2). Other concurrent work has also
conﬁrmed this in the context of cellular networks [50].
Even though the above discussion and prior work make
the case for throughput prediction, there has been little work
on understanding how predictable throughput is in the wild
or what types of prediction algorithms we need to use in
the context of video bitrate adaptation. In the next section,
we use a large-scale dataset to understand throughput pre-
dictability to inform the design of our CS2P approach.
3 Dataset and Analysis
In this section, we describe the dataset we use for analy-
sis. We highlight the limitations of strawman solutions for
initial and midstream throughput prediction and present key
insights that lead to a better throughput prediction algorithm.
Dataset: To understand throughput variability across ses-
sions and within a session, we need continuous measure-
ments over sufﬁciently long session durations that contain
enough repeated measurements of given client-server pairs.
Note that this is in contrast to other kinds of end-to-end mea-
surements of network latency, loss, jitter, or bottleneck ca-
pacity estimation (e.g., [19,25,33,49]). Unfortunately, there
are few, if any, public datasets that enable such in-depth anal-
ysis of throughput stability and predictability at scale.4
To this end, we use a proprietary dataset of HTTP
throughput measurement from the operational platform of
iQIYI collected in September 2015. iQIYI is a leading on-
line video content provider in China with a total monthly
user base of more than 219 million.
It ranks in the top-3
among the Chinese Internet video content providers in a se-
ries of key metrics such as daily/monthly active users, and
viewing time. Our dataset comes from the operational CDN
platform of iQIYI. The dataset consists of over 20 million
sessions covering 3 million unique client IPs and 18 server
IPs over 8 days in September 2015. The clients span 736
