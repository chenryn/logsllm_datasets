whether enough activity reports are on the reply-to queue to enable you to determine the required
information and arrange the activity reports in order.
About this task
The order that activity reports are put on the reply-to queue does not necessarily correlate to the order in
which the activities were performed. You must order activity reports manually, unless they are generated
64 Monitoring and Performance for IBM MQ
for a trace-route message, in which case you can use the IBM MQ display route application to order the
activity reports.
Determine whether enough activity reports are on the reply-to queue for you to obtain the necessary
information:
Procedure
1.Identify all related activity reports on the reply-to queue by comparing identifiers of the activity reports
and the original message. Ensure you set the report option of the original message such that the
activity reports can be correlated with the original message.
2.Order the identified activity reports from the reply-to queue.
You can use the following parameters from the activity report:
OperationType
The types of operations performed might enable you to determine the activity report that was
generated directly before, or after, the current activity report.
For example, an activity report details that an MCA sent a message from a transmission queue
down a channel. The last operation detailed in the activity report has an OperationType of send
and details that the message was sent using the channel, CH1, to the destination queue manager,
QM1. This means that the next activity performed on the message will have occurred on queue
manager, QM1, and that it will have begun with a receive operation from channel, CH1. By using
this information you can identify the next activity report, providing it exists and has been acquired.
OperationDate and OperationTime
You can determine the general order of the activities from the dates and times of the operations in
each activity report.
Warning: Unless every queue manager in the queue manager network has their system clocks
synchronized, ordering by date and time does not guarantee that the activity reports are in the
correct sequence. You must establish the order manually.
The order of the activity reports represents the route, or partial route, that the message took through
the queue manager network.
3.Obtain the information you need from the activity information in the ordered activity reports.
If you have insufficient information about the message, you might be able to acquire further activity
reports.
Retrieving further activity reports
To determine a message route, sufficient information must be available from the activity reports
collected. If you retrieve the activity reports related to a message from the reply-to queue that the
message specified, but you not have the necessary information, look for further activity reports.
About this task
To determine the locations of any further activity reports, perform the following steps:
Procedure
1.For any queue managers in the queue manager network that deliver activity reports to a common
queue, retrieve activity reports from the common queue that have a CorrelId that matches the MsgId of
the original message.
2.For any queue managers in the queue manager network that do not deliver activity reports to a
common queue, retrieve activity reports as follows:
a)Examine the existing activity reports to identify queue managers through which the message was
routed.
b)For these queue managers, identify the queue managers that are enabled for activity recording.
IBM MQ Monitoring and performance 65
c)For these queue managers, identify any that did not return activity reports to the specified reply-to
queue.
d)For each of the queue managers that you identify, check the system queue
SYSTEM.ADMIN.ACTIVITY.QUEUE and retrieve any activity reports that have a CorrelId that
matches the MsgId of the original message.
e)If you find no activity reports on the system queue, check the queue manager dead letter queue, if
one exists.
An activity report can only be delivered to a dead letter queue if the report option,
MQRO_DEAD_LETTER_Q, is set.
3.Arrange all the acquired activity reports in order.
The order of the activity reports then represents the route, or partial route, that the message took.
4.Obtain the information you need from the activity information in the ordered activity reports.
In some circumstances, recorded activity information cannot reach the specified reply-to queue, a
common queue, or a system queue.
Circumstances where activity information is not acquired
To determine the complete sequence of activities performed on behalf of a message, information related
to every activity must be acquired. If the information relating to any activity has not been recorded, or has
not been acquired, you can determine only a partial sequence of activities.
Activity information is not recorded in the following circumstances:
• The message is processed by a queue manager earlier than IBM WebSphere MQ 6.0.
• The message is processed by a queue manager that is not enabled for activity recording.
• The application that expected to process the message is not running.
Recorded activity information is unable to reach the specified reply-to queue in the following
circumstances:
• There is no channel defined to route activity reports to the reply-to queue.
• The channel to route activity reports to the reply-to queue is not running.
• The remote queue definition to route activity reports back to the queue manager where the reply-to
queue resides (the queue manager alias), is not defined.
• The user that generated the original message does not have open, or put, authority to the queue
manager alias.
• The user that generated the original message does not have open, or put, authority to the reply-to
queue.
• The reply-to queue is put inhibited.
Recorded activity information is unable to reach the system queue, or a common queue, in the following
circumstances:
• If a common queue is to be used and there is no channel defined to route activity reports to the
common queue.
• If a common queue is to be used and the channel to route activity reports to the common queue is not
running.
• If a common queue is to be used and the system queue is incorrectly defined.
• The user that generated the original message does not have open, or put, authority to the system queue.
• The system queue is put inhibited.
• If a common queue is to be used and the user that generated the original message does not have open,
or put, authority to the common queue.
• If a common queue is to be used and the common queue is put inhibited.
In these circumstances, providing the activity report does not have the report option
MQRO_DISCARD_MSG specified, the activity report can be retrieved from a dead letter queue if one
66 Monitoring and Performance for IBM MQ
was defined on the queue manager where the activity report was rejected. An activity report will only have
this report option specified if the original message, from which the activity report was generated, had
both MQRO_PASS_DISCARD_AND_EXPIRY and MQRO_DISCARD_MSG specified in the Report field of the
message descriptor.
Trace-route messaging
Trace-route messaging is a technique that uses trace-route messages to record activity information for a
message. Trace-route messaging involves sending a trace-route message into a queue manager network.
As the trace-route message is routed through the queue manager network, activity information is
recorded. This activity information includes information about the applications that performed the
activities, when they were performed, and the operations that were performed as part of the activities.
You can use the information recorded using trace-route messaging for the following purposes:
To determine the last known location of a message
If a message does not reach its intended destination, you can use the activity information recorded for
a trace-route message to determine the last known location of the message. A trace-route message
is sent into a queue manager network with the same target destination as the original message,
intending that it follows the same route. Activity information can be accumulated in the message data
of the trace-route message, or recorded using activity reports. To increase the probability that the
trace-route message follows the same route as the original message, you can modify the trace-route
message to mimic the original message.
To determine configuration issues with a queue manager network
Trace-route messages are sent into a queue manager network and activity information is recorded.
By studying the activity information recorded for a trace-route message, it can become apparent that
the trace-route message did not follow the expected route. There are many reasons why this can
occur, for example, a channel might be inactive, forcing the message to take an alternative route. In
these situations, a system administrator can determine whether there are any problems in the queue
manager network, and if there are, correct them.
You can use the IBM MQ display route application to configure, generate, and put trace-route messages
into a queue manager network.
Warning: If you put a trace-route message to a distribution list, the results are undefined.

Use this page to obtain an overview of the trace-route message format. The trace-route message data
includes parameters that describe the activities that the trace-route message has caused
How activity information is recorded
With trace-route messaging, you can record activity information in the message data of the trace-route
message, or use activity reports. Alternatively, you can use both techniques.
Accumulating activity information in the message data of the trace-route message
As a trace-route message is routed through a queue manager network, information about the activities
performed on behalf of the trace-route message can be accumulated in the message data of the trace-
route message. The activity information is stored in Activity PCF groups. For every activity performed on
behalf of the trace-route message, an Activity PCF group is written to the end of the PCF block in the
message data of the trace-route message.
Additional activity information is recorded in trace-route messaging, in a PCF group called the TraceRoute
PCF group. The additional activity information is stored in this PCF group, and can be used to help
determine the sequence of recorded activities. This technique is controlled by the Accumulate parameter
in the TraceRoute PCF group.
IBM MQ Monitoring and performance 67
Recording activity information using activity reports
As a trace-route message is routed through a queue manager network, an activity report can be generated
for every activity that was performed on behalf of the trace-route message. The activity information is
stored in the Activity PCF group. For every activity performed on behalf of a trace-route message, an
activity report is generated containing an Activity PCF group. Activity recording for trace-route messages
works in the same way as for any other message.
Activity reports generated for trace-route messages contain additional activity information compared to
the those generated for any other message. The additional information is returned in a TraceRoute PCF
group. The information contained in the TraceRoute PCF group is accurate only from the time the activity
report was generated. You can use the additional information to help determine the sequence of activities
performed on behalf of the trace-route message.
Acquiring recorded activity information
When a trace-route message has reached its intended destination, or is discarded, the method that you
use to acquire the activity information depends on how that information was recorded.
Before you begin
If you are unfamiliar with activity information, refer to “How activity information is recorded” on page 67.
About this task
Use the following methods to acquire the activity information after the trace-route message has reached
its intended destination, or is discarded:
Procedure
• Retrieve the trace-route message.
The Deliver parameter, in the TraceRoute PCF group, controls whether a trace-route message is placed
on the target queue on arrival, or whether it is discarded. If the trace-route message is delivered to the
target queue, you can retrieve the trace-route message from this queue. Then, you can use the IBM
MQ display route application to display the activity information.
To request that activity information is accumulated in the message data of a trace-route message, set
the Accumulate parameter in the TraceRoute PCF group to MQROUTE_ACCUMULATE_IN_MSG.
• Use a trace-route reply message.
When a trace-route message reaches its intended destination, or the trace-route message cannot
be routed any further in a queue manager network, a trace-route reply message can be generated.
A trace-route reply message contains a duplicate of all the activity information from the trace-
route message, and is either delivered to a specified reply-to queue, or the system queue
SYSTEM.ADMIN.TRACE.ROUTE.QUEUE. You can use the IBM MQ display route application to display
the activity information.
To request a trace-route reply message, set the Accumulate parameter in the TraceRoute PCF group to
MQROUTE_ACCUMULATE_AND_REPLY.
• Use activity reports.
If activity reports are generated for a trace-route message, you must locate the activity reports before
you can acquire the activity information. Then, to determine the sequence of activities, you must order
the activity reports.
Controlling trace-route messaging
Enable trace-route messaging at the queue manager level, so that applications in the scope of that queue
manager can write activity information to a trace-route message. To enable an entire queue manager
network, individually enable every queue manager in the network for trace-route messaging. If you
enable more queue managers, more activity reports are generated.
68 Monitoring and Performance for IBM MQ
Before you begin
If you are using activity reports to record activity information for a trace-route message, refer to
“Controlling activity recording” on page 63.
About this task
To record activity information for a trace-route message as it is routed through a queue manager, perform
the following steps:
Procedure
• Define how activity information is to be recorded for the trace-route message.
Refer to “Generating and configuring a trace-route message” on page 71
• If you want to accumulate activity information in the trace-route message, ensure that the queue
manager is enabled for trace-route messaging
• If you want to accumulate activity information in the trace-route message, ensure that applications
performing activities on the trace-route message are capable of writing activity information to the
message data of the trace-route message

managers, more activity reports are generated.
Enabling queue managers for trace-route messaging
To control whether queue managers are enabled or disabled for trace-route messaging use the queue
manager attribute ROUTEREC.
Use the MQSC command ALTER QMGR, specifying the parameter ROUTEREC to change the value of the
queue manager attribute. The value can be any of the following values:
MSG
The queue manager is enabled for trace-route messaging. Applications within the scope of the queue
manager can write activity information to the trace-route message.
If the Accumulate parameter in the TraceRoute PCF group is set as
MQROUTE_ACCUMULATE_AND_REPLY, and the next activity to be performed on the trace-route
message:
• is a discard
• is a put to a local queue (target queue or dead-letter queue)
• will cause the total number of activities performed on the trace-route message to exceed the value
of parameter the MaxActivities, in the TraceRoute PCF group .
a trace-route reply message is generated, and delivered to the reply-to queue specified in the
message descriptor of the trace-route message.
QUEUE
The queue manager is enabled for trace-route messaging. Applications within the scope of the queue
manager can write activity information to the trace-route message.
If the Accumulate parameter in the TraceRoute PCF group is set as
MQROUTE_ACCUMULATE_AND_REPLY, and the next activity to be performed on the trace-route
message:
IBM MQ Monitoring and performance 69
• is a discard
• is a put to a local queue (target queue or dead-letter queue)
• will cause the total number of activities performed on the trace-route message to exceed the value
of parameter the MaxActivities, in the TraceRoute PCF group .
a trace-route reply message is generated, and delivered to the local system queue
SYSTEM.ADMIN.TRACE.ROUTE.QUEUE.
DISABLED
The queue manager is disabled for trace-route messaging. Activity information is not accumulated in
the the trace-route message, however the TraceRoute PCF group can be updated while in the scope of
this queue manager.
For example, to disable a queue manager for trace-route messaging, use the following MQSC command:
ALTER QMGR ROUTEREC(DISABLED)
Remember: When you modify the ROUTEREC queue manager attribute, a running MCA does not detect
the change until the channel is restarted.
Enabling applications for trace-route messaging
To enable trace-route messaging for a user application, base your algorithm on the algorithm used by
message channel agents (MCAs)
Before you begin
If you are not familiar with the format of a trace-route message, see “Trace-route message reference” on
page 124.
About this task
Message channel agents (MCAs) are enabled for trace-route messaging. To enable a user application for
trace-route messaging, use the following steps from the algorithm that MCAs use:
Procedure
1.Determine whether the message being processed is a trace-route message.
If the message does not conform to the format of a trace-route message, the message is not
processed as a trace-route message.
2.Determine whether activity information is to be recorded.
If the detail level of the performed activity is not less than the level of detail specified by the
Detail parameter, activity information is recorded under specific circumstances. This information is
only recorded if the trace-route message requests accumulation, and the queue manager is enabled
for trace-route messaging, or if the trace-route message requests an activity report and the queue
manager is enabled for activity recording.
• If activity information is to be recorded, increment the RecordedActivities parameter.
• If activity information is not to be recorded, increment the UnrecordedActivities parameter.
3.Determine whether the total number of activities performed on the trace-route message exceeds the
value of the MaxActivities parameter.
The total number of activities is the sum of RecordedActivities, UnrecordedActivities, and
DiscontinuityCount.
If the total number of activities exceeds MaxActivities, reject the message with feedback
MQFB_MAX_ACTIVITIES.
4.If value of Accumulate is set as MQROUTE_ACCUMULATE_IN_MSG or
MQROUTE_ACCUMULATE_AND_REPLY, and the queue manager is enabled for trace-route messaging,
write an Activity PCF group to the end of the PCF block in the message data of a trace-route message.
70 Monitoring and Performance for IBM MQ
5.Deliver the trace-route message to a local queue.
• If the parameter, Deliver, is specified as MQROUTE_DELIVER_NO, reject the trace-route message
with feedback MQFB_NOT_DELIVERED.
• If the parameter, Deliver, is specified as MQROUTE_DELIVER_YES, deliver the trace-route message
to the local queue.
6.Generate a trace-route reply message if all the following conditions are true:
• The trace-route message was delivered to a local queue or rejected
• The value of the parameter, Accumulate, is MQROUTE_ACCUMULATE_AND_REPLY
• The queue manager is enabled for trace-route messaging
The trace-route reply message is put on the queue determined by the ROUTEREC queue manager
attribute.
7.If the trace-route message requested an activity report and the queue manager is enabled for activity
recording, generate an activity report.
The activity report is put on the queue determined by the ACTIVREC queue manager attribute.
Generating and configuring a trace-route message
A trace-route message comprises specific message descriptor and message data parts. To generate a
trace-route message, either create the message manually or use the IBM MQ display route application.
A trace-route message consists of the following parts:
Message descriptor
An MQMD structure, with the Format field set to MQFMT_ADMIN or MQFMT_EMBEDDED_PCF.
Message data
One of the following combinations:
• A PCF header (MQCFH) and trace-route message data, if Format is set to MQFMT_ADMIN
• An embedded PCF header (MQEPH), trace-route message data, and additional user-specified
message data, if Format is set to MQFMT_EMBEDDED_PCF
The trace-route message data consists of the TraceRoute PCF group and one or more Activity PCF groups.
Manual generation
When generating a trace-route message manually, an Activity PCF group is not required. Activity PCF
groups are written to the message data of the trace-route message when an MCA or user-written
application performs an activity on its behalf.
The IBM MQ display route application
Use the IBM MQ display route application, dspmqrte, to configure, generate and put a trace-route
message into a queue manager network. Set the Format parameter in the message descriptor to
MQFMT_ADMIN. You cannot add user data to the trace-route message generated by the IBM MQ display
route application.
Restriction: dspmqrte cannot be issued on queue managers before IBM WebSphere MQ 6.0 or on IBM
MQ for z/OS queue managers. If you want the first queue manager the trace-route message is routed
through to be a queue manager of this type, connect to the queue manager as an IBM WebSphere MQ 6.0
or later client using the optional parameter -c.
Mimicking the original message
When using a trace-route message to determine the route another message has taken through a queue
manager network, the more closely a trace-route message mimics the original message, the greater the
chance that the trace-route message will follow the same route as the original message.
The following message characteristics can affect where a message is forwarded to within a queue
manager network:
IBM MQ Monitoring and performance 71
Priority
The priority can be specified in the message descriptor of the message.
Persistence
The persistence can be specified in the message descriptor of the message.
Expiration
The expiration can be specified in the message descriptor of the message.
Report options
Report options can be specified in the message descriptor of the message.
Message size
To mimic the size of a message, additional data can be written to the message data of the message.
For this purpose, additional message data can be meaningless.
Tip: The IBM MQ display route application cannot specify message size.
Message data
Some queue manager networks use content based routing to determine where messages are
forwarded. In these cases the message data of the trace-route message needs to be written to mimic
the message data of the original message.
Tip: The IBM MQ display route application cannot specify message data.
The TraceRoute PCF group
Attributes in the TraceRoute PCF group control the behavior of a trace-route message. The TraceRoute PCF
group is in the message data of every trace-route message.
The following table lists the parameters in the TraceRoute group that an MCA recognizes. Further
parameters can be added if user-written applications are written to recognize them, as described in
“Additional activity information” on page 77.
