User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题SELinux - Allow system_u and new SELinux user to log in via SSH I am new to SELinux and I am still trying to figure out how everything works but my goal is to create a Linux account associated with either system_u or a new SELinux user and try to ssh to my machine using that account. However, when I try to ssh to the machine in Enforcing mode using such an account I get the following message

Unable to get valid context for user

, even though I can still log in fine as root or a guest_u account
The following messages are logged to the /var/log/secure file when trying to ssh as the system_u user

Apr 23 23:38:01 localhost sshd[1678]: Received disconnect from 192.168.56.1: 11: disconnected by user

Any ideas on how I could modify the policy that creates this behavior?
I am using CentOS 6.8

Assistant: I hit this same issue and resolved it by restarting sshd. Might work for your scenario ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ ...
