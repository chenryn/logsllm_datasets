### Load Balancer Security Controls

| **Control** | **Description & Rationale** | **Severity** | **Automated Fix Script** |
|-------------|-----------------------------|--------------|--------------------------|
| **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** | All users and identities must be granted the minimum required permissions using Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). By leveraging RBAC, you ensure that users are given just enough permissions to perform their tasks, thereby minimizing the risk of resource exposure in the event of a user or service account compromise. | **Medium** | Yes | No |
| **Diagnostics Logs Retention** | Diagnostics logs must be enabled with a retention period of at least 365 days. Retaining logs for a sufficient period allows for the recreation of activity trails when investigations are required following an incident or compromise. A one-year retention period is a common requirement for many compliance standards. | **Medium** | Yes | No |
| **Public IPs on Internet-Facing Load Balancers** | Public IPs on internet-facing load balancers should be carefully reviewed. Public IPs provide direct access over the internet, exposing the infrastructure behind the load balancer to a wide range of attacks from the public network. | **High** | Yes | No |

This table outlines the key security controls for load balancers, along with their descriptions, rationale, severity, and whether an automated fix script is available.
