User: I have installed Python 3.2 in my Mac. After I run /Applications/Python 3.2/Update Shell Profile.command, it's confusing that when I type Python -V in Terminal it says that Python 2.6.1.
How can I change the default Python version?
Assistant: Starting with macOS Catalina the default shell is zsh. Therefore, all those ~/.bash_profile changes are not going to change the default when you open a new terminal since the new terminal is a zsh shell and not a bash shell.
You can confirm your terminal is a zsh shell by typing echo $SHELL and you should see a response of: zsh.
What should you do? You should use a solution that works for zsh shell and bash shell. Therefore, do the following:

enter: vi ~/.bash_profile
enter: alias python='python3'
close and save your bash_profile. Enter: :wq
Now open/create your zsh profile. Enter: vi ~/.zshrc
source your bash inside your zshrc. Enter: source ~/.bash_profile

Now python will be aliased to python3 in your zsh shells (and in bash if you switch the default) automatically.
Test:
python --version
Python 3.8.9
