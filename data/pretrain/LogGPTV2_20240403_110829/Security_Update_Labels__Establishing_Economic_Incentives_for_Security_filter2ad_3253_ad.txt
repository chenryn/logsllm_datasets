is highly statistically signiﬁcant with the large effect size:
t(1464) = 28.42, p .837) [63].
For the analysis of the collected conjoint data from the
randomly-generated choice tasks, we used hierarchical Bayes
estimation with default settings as recommended [87]. Using
this estimation method, we determined the average relative
importance of each product attribute as well as the part-
worth utility for each product level based on a total of 5,848
(home camera) and 5,880 (weather station) choice tasks. The
relative importance of an attribute deﬁnes the relative impact
(measured in percent) on the overall choice. The importances
are ratio data meaning that an attribute with an importance
of 20% is twice as much important as an attribute with an
importance of 10% [98].
As listed in Table III, the availability of security updates
(31%) is the most important attribute for smart home cameras.
It is twice as important as price (15%) and provisioning time
for security updates (14%). Other functional attributes are less
important with relative importance between 8% and 12%. For
the smart weather stations, the availability of security updates
(20%) is also the most
the
difference in importance to other product attributes is smaller
than for the smart home cameras. The relative importance of
price, rain and wind sensor, and provisioning time for security
updates are at around 16%. All other attributes are ranked with
relative importances between 7% and 13%.
important attribute. However,
In general, the relative importance of the attributes differ
between both product categories. Good research practice,
e.g., [86], strongly discourages quantitative comparison of
preference measurements of different product categories to
each other, as the importance of an attribute can only be
interpreted as relative value within the particular product
category. Therefore, we discuss the possible differences qual-
itatively. For the product with the high perceived security
risk, especially the availability of security updates (twice as
important as other attributes) seems to play a more crucial
role in buying decisions than for the product with the low
perceived security risk (only slightly more important than other
attributes). Furthermore, the provisioning time for security
updates is considered the third most important attribute for the
product with the high perceived security risk and the fourth
most important attribute for the product with the low perceived
security risk. Thus, the provisioning time for security updates
seems to have a similar importance than price and other
highly-ranked technical attributes.
To summarize, the availability of security updates plays the
most important role in the consumers’ choice in this study.
The relative importance of the provisioning time for security
updates is also high, although substantially lower than of the
availability of security updates. For both product categories,
the second most important attribute is the price. Functional
features of both product categories are rated as less important
than the attributes of the security update label and price, except
the rain and wind sensor for smart weather stations.
Table IV shows the average utilities that consumers ascribe
to the levels of product attributes [98]. Negative utilities repre-
sent unfavorable options compared to the other options, while
positive utilities describe the favorable options. The utilities
of all levels of a certain product attribute add up to zero.
For the price attribute, lower prices have a higher utility for
consumers. For both product categories, the non-availability of
security updates is considered as especially unfavorable with
the highest negative utility scores among all attributes. The
availability of security updates for 6 years is more favorable
than for 2 years. The utility for the provisioning time for
security updates shows a preference for short time period
(10 days) rather than a longer time period (30 days). A
provisioning time of 30 days has a negative utility for the
smart home camera, in contrast to the smart weather station.
Thus, participants dislike long provisioning times for a product
with high perceived security risk.
F. Validity
We tested the internal consistency of our results by compar-
ing simulations based on the preference measurement results
with choice data from holdout
tasks (cf. Section VI-A).
Furthermore, we validated the preference for long availability
periods and short provisioning times. The results of the holdout
tasks were not included into the calculation of the preference
measurement results.
For the holdout tasks, we deﬁned ﬁve product proﬁles – P1,
P2, P3a, P3b, P4 – for each product category. Proﬁles P3a and
P3b differ only in their security update label attributes: In P3a,
there was no guarantee for the availability and provisioning

time of security updates. In P3b, these two attributes were set
to the objectively best levels: availability of security updates
for 6 years with provisioning time of 10 days.
In the course of the survey, each respondent performed 10
choice tasks, of which 8 were randomly-generated tasks and
2 were ﬁxed holdout tasks. The ﬁxed holdout tasks were the
same for all respondents of a product category and appeared
as the 4th and 8th of the 10 choice tasks. Both holdout task
consisted of the four product proﬁles that were presented in
a different ﬁxed order. In the ﬁrst holdout task (i.e., the 4th
choice task), the proﬁles (P1, P2, P3a, P4) were presented. In
the second holdout task (i.e., the 8th choice task), the proﬁles
(P4, P3b, P2, P1) were presented.
The results in Table V (‘Real’-columns) for smart home
cameras show that in the ﬁrst holdout task 6.6% decided for
P3a without guarantee for security updates, while in the second
holdout task 53.4% chose P3b with best guarantee for security
updates. The same effect can be observed for the smart weather
station: in the ﬁrst choice task, 9.5% choose P3a, while 32.7%
decided for P3b. This validates the results that we derived from
the randomly-generated choice tasks: The (non-)availability of
security updates is an important factor in buying decisions,
while this effect seems to be higher for products with high
perceived security risk.
We tested the consistency of the hierarchical Bayes esti-
mation with the market simulator from Lighthouse Studio,
which represents a standard procedure to assess the internal
validity of CBC models [89]. This market simulator estimates
the shares of preferences for the product proﬁles P1 to P4
based on the preference measurement results of the conjoint
analysis. We compared the estimated market shares with the
evidence gathered through the holdout tasks (see Table V).
For example, in the ﬁrst holdout task of the smart home
camera, the market simulator estimated a market share of
84.4% for P4, while the evaluation of the real choices showed
that 72.8% of the respondents decided for P4. Based on the
comparison of estimated and real choices, we conclude that
although the simulator does not exactly match the real choices,
the preference measurement results are robust in estimating
the order and magnitude of the overall preferences, which
indicates a high consistency of the results.
G. Segmentation
We used the latent class segmentation module of Lighthouse
Studio to assign respondents to groups that have similar
preferences. The module implements latent class analysis, a
classiﬁcation technique to ﬁnd groups in multi-dimensional
data. First, we needed a measure to decide in how many
reasonable segments we split the respondents. Following rec-
ommendations of Sawtooth Software [100], we used the con-
sistent Akaike’s information criterion [101] as measure. Based
on this criterion (see Appendix C), we decided to split the
respondents of the product categories “smart home camera”
and “smart weather station” into two and three segments,
respectively. The consumer segmentation for both product
categories is shown in Table VI. The differences in preferences
between the segments are given in Table VII.
For the smart home camera, both segments differ statisti-
cally signiﬁcantly only in the perceived security risk. For the
ﬁrst group with lower security risk perception towards smart
home cameras, the availability of security updates (31%) is
the most important product attribute and twice as important as
resolution (16%) and price (12%). In comparison to the impor-
tance of technical features (9–11%) other than the resolution,
the availability of security updates is even three times more
important. For the second group with the higher security risk
perception, the availability (25%) and provisioning time (19%)
of security updates are the most important product attributes
followed by price (17%). Compared to the importance of the
technical features (9–12%), availability and provisioning time
are (almost) twice as important.
For the smart weather station, the segments differ statisti-
cally signiﬁcantly with regard to age, vocational qualiﬁcation,
income, privacy concerns, security behavior intentions, and
perceived security risk. The ﬁrst group exhibits the highest
average age, high vocational qualiﬁcations, the highest income,
high privacy concerns, the highest security behavior intentions,
as well as a high security risk perception towards smart
weather stations. For this group, the availability of security
updates (23%) as well as the rain and wind sensor (23%) are
the most important product attributes, followed by provision-
ing time (20%) and expandability (16%). These attributes are
2 to 3 times as important as the price (8%).
The second group is characterized by lower vocational
qualiﬁcation, the highest privacy concerns, and the highest
perceived security risk. For this group, the attributes of the
security update label dominate the choice decision and account
for 60% of the overall importance. The availability (35%) and
provisioning time (25%) is three and two times as important,
respectively, than technical features. For this group, the price
(6%) is the least important attribute for their choice.
The third group perceives the lowest risk for smart weather
stations. This group is the youngest on average, has the lowest
income, as well as the lowest privacy concerns and security
behavior intentions. The most important product attribute is the
