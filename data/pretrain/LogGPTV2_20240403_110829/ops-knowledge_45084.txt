User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题User with root privileges to restart a service can't I want a user to be able to restart the php5-fpm service.  In visudo, I have the following:

username ALL=NOPASSWD: /etc/init.d/php5-fpm

When I su to the user and run sudo /etc/init.d/php5-fpm stop, nothing happens.  There's no feedback and the service is still running.

What do I need to do to allow username to control the service?  Running Ubuntu 13.10.

Edit: Looking in auth.log I see

sudo: username : TTY=pts/1 ; PWD=/var/log ; USER=root ; COMMAND=/etc/init.d/php5-fpm stop

Assistant: As rootslash's comments suggest, I believe something in the PHP-FPM binary needs root that this user doesn't have (opening ports maybe?).  I've decided to have this user touch a file that the root user checks once a minute (cron) and if it's found, restarts the service and then deletes the file.

Not ideal, but works to make this happen.
