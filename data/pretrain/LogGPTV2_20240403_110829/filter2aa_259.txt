# Introduction

**About the Author:**
- **Professional Background:** Security professional by day, White Hat hacker since the 1970s.
- **Community Involvement:** DEFCON Goon since DC5, co-founder of InterFACE internet pirate radio station.

# Why InfraRed (IR)?

**Ubiquity and Applications:**
- **Modern Applications:** IR technology is still widely used in various modern applications, including:
  - **TV / Cable / Satellite Remotes:** Master configuration, tuning, package selection, central control, and billing.
  - **Vending Machines:** Programming and price changes.
  - **Public Display Signs:** Message programming and master configuration.
  - **Garage Door Openers:** Control and security.
  - **Car Alarm Systems:** Central locking and security.
  - **Air Conditioning Systems:** Remote control and configuration.

# Why MMIrDA?

**Project Overview:**
- **MMIrDA (Major Malfunction's Infra Red Discovery Application):** Initially intended to develop a tool for FreeBSD, but existing tools like LIRC were already available under Linux.
- **Hardware Compatibility:** Built-in IrDA serial ports on laptops facilitate the use of IR communication.

# Why Bother with IR?

**Rationale:**
- **Durability and Cost-Effectiveness:** IR is unlikely to be replaced due to its fit-for-use nature, low cost, and simplicity.
- **Skill Development:** Practicing with IR enhances your skills and understanding of security and technology.
- **Security Awareness:** Knowing how IR works helps in understanding potential vulnerabilities and improving security measures.

# IR Security Considerations

**Inherent Vulnerabilities:**
- **Security by Obscurity:** IR signals are invisible, making them easy to intercept and manipulate.
- **Simple Codes:** Many IR devices use simple codes, which can be easily recorded and retransmitted.
- **Inverted Security Model:** End-user devices often filter content, leading to potential security gaps.
- **Replay Attacks:** Simple replay attacks can be executed by recording and retransmitting codes.
- **Brute Force Attacks:** Analyzing and inferring codes through brute force methods can compromise security.

# Tools and Techniques

**Cloning and Replay:**
- **Learning Remotes:** Devices like Casio IR Watches, Apple Newton, OmniRemote, PalmOS, and Philips Pronto can clone and replay IR codes.
- **Human-Readable Formats:** Tools like Philips Pronto provide human-readable (Hex) configurations.
- **Development Libraries:** Resources such as Pacific NeoTek and Remote Central offer development libraries and tools.

**Brute Force Tools:**
- **LIRC:** A Linux-based tool for recording, analyzing, and transmitting IR codes.
- **iRTrans:** A more powerful transmitter that addresses PC timing issues and works with a wide range of targets via serial or USB.

# Case Studies

**Garage Door Openers:**
- **Code Analysis:** Using tools like XMODE2 to analyze data bits and create LIRC configurations.
- **Testing and Configuration:** Generating and testing all possible codes to identify valid ones.

**Hotel TV Systems:**
- **Inverted Security Model:** Back-end systems may broadcast all content, with the TV filtering it based on user input.
- **Hidden Codes:** Discovering and exploiting hidden codes to access additional features and functionalities.
- **New Capabilities:** Reconfiguring TVs, changing messages, assigning channels, and viewing back-end systems.

# Future Projects

**Upcoming Research:**
- **Car Alarm / Central Locking:** Investigating the transition from IR to RF and the use of rolling codes.
- **Hotel Safes:** Exploring IR dongles for master programming and unlocking.
- **TVB-Gone:** Developing tools for car alarm reset sequences and other security applications.

# Conclusion

**Summary:**
- IR technology remains relevant and widely used, offering both opportunities and challenges in terms of security and functionality.
- Understanding and experimenting with IR can enhance your technical skills and contribute to better security practices.
