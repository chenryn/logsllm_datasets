### Optimizing Link Capacity and Reliability in Optical Networks

#### 1. Introduction
In this section, we discuss the selection of fiber links with sufficient Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) to support various capacity denominations over a three-year period. We then analyze the impact of increasing link capacities on failure rates and duration, and explore the potential for dynamic capacity adjustment to improve network availability.

#### 2. Static Capacity Analysis
We select a fiber where each link (i.e., optical channel) has an SNR high enough to support all capacity denominations over a three-year period. For example, we analyze the number of failures that would occur if the links were modulated with higher but static capacities. Figure 2(a) shows that for a specific fiber, increasing the capacity up to 175 Gbps does not significantly increase the number of failures. However, at 200 Gbps, some links experience up to 100 failures. This behavior varies across different fibers due to factors such as the number of links, fiber length, technology, and equipment age. Consequently, it is impractical to set a one-size-fits-all static capacity above 100 Gbps.

Furthermore, we characterize the duration of link failures. Figure 2(b) illustrates the duration of link failures for different modulated capacities based on the average SNR. We observe that these failure events can last several hours, which is unacceptable. This highlights the need to adapt capacity dynamically in response to SNR drops to maintain reliability.

#### 3. Incomplete Loss-of-Light Failures
Contrary to common belief, not all failures result in a complete loss of light. SNR drops can be caused by planned maintenance (e.g., line card replacement) or unplanned events (e.g., fiber cut, hardware failure, human error). While some impairments render the link unusable, others may only degrade signal quality, allowing the link to still carry traffic at a reduced rate. This presents an opportunity to improve link availability.

To quantify this opportunity, we manually analyzed seven months of failure tickets (250 events) reported by WAN field operators to identify root causes. The five identified types of root causes are:
- **Power Failure:** Complete loss of light due to power line failure.
- **Fiber Cuts:** Accidental breaks in optical fibers, often due to construction projects, leading to complete loss of light.
- **Hardware Failure:** Malfunction of optical hardware, such as degrading amplifiers, transponders, or optical cross-connects.
- **Human Error:** Unintentional disturbances to operational fibers during work on other parts.
- **Other:** Unidentified root causes.

Figure 3(a) shows the contribution of each root cause to total outage duration. Fiber cuts and power failures account for 10% of total outages, indicating that complete outages are relatively rare. Human errors contribute 20% to the total outage time. The remaining categories include hardware failures and other undocumented causes.

Even in current failures, there is an opportunity to run links at reduced rates. By recording the lowest SNR values at failure events, we find that 25% of failures could have been avoided by reducing the link capacity to 50 Gbps when the SNR falls below the 100 Gbps threshold (6.5 dB). This underscores the potential for improved availability through dynamic capacity adjustment.

#### 4. Dynamic Capacity Links
Our analysis suggests that links are currently operating well below their potential transmission rates based on SNR values. However, operating links at constant transmission rates closer to the observed SNR increases the likelihood of failures. To balance this trade-off, we propose dynamically adjusting physical link capacities in centrally controlled wide area networks by changing the modulation format of optical signals. This is enabled by recent advancements in bandwidth variable transceivers (BVTs), which support 16QAM, 8QAM, and QPSK formats, corresponding to 200 Gbps, 150 Gbps, and 100 Gbps, respectively.

However, changing the modulation format incurs a latency of over one minute, rendering the link unusable during this time. To address this, we are investigating ways to reduce reconfiguration latency and develop hitless capacity change mechanisms (Section 7.1).

#### 5. Traffic Engineering with Dynamic Capacity Links
In networks with dynamic capacity links, the state of the network in each run of the traffic engineering (TE) optimization algorithm depends on the links' underlying SNR. Therefore, TE controllers must be modified to gather SNR data and treat link capacities as variables. We propose the RADWAN centralized TE controller, which can leverage dynamic capacity links to achieve higher network throughput and availability.

RADWAN handles spikes in demand by upgrading link capacities. However, the reconfiguration process causes a link outage lasting over a minute, necessitating the migration of existing traffic flows. This can cause transient congestion, so the objective of traffic engineering shifts to maximizing throughput while minimizing churn caused by link capacity reconfigurations.

#### 6. Quantifying Network Churn
To manage churn, we define it in terms of the rate of traffic on the link. The capacity change of a link carrying \( f_l \) units of traffic will displace these units. Displacement of large flows is more likely to cause transient congestion. Thus, the churn induced by the capacity change of link \( l \) is defined as:

\[ \text{churn}(l) = f_l \]

The overall churn \( C \) in the network is the sum of churn from each link undergoing capacity change:

\[ C = \sum_{\text{links}} \text{churn}(l) \]

#### 7. Computing Flow Allocations
When computing flow allocations in a network with dynamic capacity links, RADWAN aims to maximize network utilization while minimizing churn. The optimization problem is formulated using the churn definition. Inputs to the controller include the network topology, traffic demand matrix, and SNR measurements for all physical links. The controller derives the potential capacity of each link and makes decisions based on the existing flow on all links.

Algorithm 1 describes the optimization goal, which is a modified multi-commodity flow problem that maximizes overall throughput while augmenting link capacities minimally.

```python
Algorithm 1: Traffic Engineering Optimization
1 Inputs:
2   di: flow demands for source-destination pair i
3   cl: capacity of each link l
4   pl: potential capacity increase of each link l
5 Outputs:
6   bi,j: allocation of flow i along path j in the network
```

By implementing these strategies, we aim to enhance the reliability and efficiency of optical networks, ensuring they operate closer to their full potential.
