User: I have an Echoprint local webserver (uses tokyotyrant, python, solr) set up on a Linux virtual machine.
I can access it through the browser or curl in the virtual machine using http//localhost:8080 and in the non-virtual machine (couldn't find out how to say it better) I use the IP on the virtual machine also with the 8080 port.
However, when I try to access it through my android on the same wifi I get a connection refused error.
Assistant: Is the server bound to localhost or 0.0.0.0?
Maybe your host resolves that ip to some kind of a localhost as well, due to bridging.
