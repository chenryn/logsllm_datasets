### 5.1 Cyber Game Experiences

Between 2012 and 2013, MITRE conducted six cyber games to experiment with and refine the skills of both Red and Blue Teams. These exercises provided valuable learning experiences that informed the structure and scope of future exercises. This section will discuss the first three cyber games, highlighting the lessons learned and how these insights drove the refinement of subsequent cyber games. Additionally, the section will annotate the cyber game narratives with ATT&CK tactics and techniques in the footnotes to illustrate how the ATT&CK model was integrated into MITRE’s plans.

#### Asynchronous Exercise Timing
As discussed in Section 4, these cyber games were conducted several weeks after a simulated compromise. The primary reason for this timing was that the games were performed by researchers rather than full-time network defenders. Synchronous games would have required constant network monitoring, which would have interfered with the researchers' other responsibilities. Alternatively, pre-arranged monitoring periods would have alerted the Blue Team to the timing of the attacks, an unrealistic scenario. Instead, MITRE's analytic writers monitored the network periodically, and any suspicious activity was verified with the White Team lead. Once the analytics matured, the Blue Team typically detected the Red Team during adversary emulation operations. Researchers who detected Red Team activities were excluded from the exercise until the rest of the team narrowed down the time frame, to avoid biasing the exercise with prior knowledge.

#### Cyber Game #1
The first cyber game featured a Blue Team composed of individuals with varied backgrounds, none of whom had direct experience in Blue Teaming. In contrast, the Red Team members had several years of experience, giving them an initial advantage. The exercise aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of potential sensors, which were not widely deployed at the time, leading to limited visibility. Despite this, the Blue Team successfully identified a significant amount of Red Team activity, including noisy actions and the creation of flag files using Windows file shares (SMB). The Red Team also used credential harvesting tools. The Blue Team's success was largely due to the use of endpoint sensors that provided visibility into command lines and SMB file copies.

#### Cyber Game #2
In the second cyber game, the Red Team adopted more advanced tactics, such as renaming built-in Windows commands and avoiding obvious actions like writing flag files. The sensor environment was still unstable, leading to gaps in visibility. Although the Blue Team had the lowest success rate in this game, they learned valuable lessons. One key takeaway was the need to develop analytics for analyzing user login activity, particularly administrative activity. MITRE also realized the importance of a stable network environment and better sensor deployment for future exercises.

#### Cyber Game #3
The third cyber game was designed to be more balanced, challenging the Blue Team while allowing them to validate previous analytics. The White Team intentionally directed the Red Team towards specific TTPs to generate alerts and introduced new TTPs to test the Blue Team. The Blue Team achieved a similar success rate to the first exercise, identifying most Red Team activities but struggling with some aspects, such as determining the exfiltrated data and Red Team persistence methods.

### 5.2 Analytic Iteration

One of the core principles of ATT&CK-based analytics is iteration. A prime example of this is the evolution of the Suspicious Commands Analytic. Initially, the analytic was designed to identify certain commands based on open-source threat information and ATT&CK techniques. After the first cyber game, MITRE researchers modified the analytic to look for groups of commands run together, reducing noise and adding context. The Red Team's use of renamed tools in the second game forced the Blue Team to develop a new method, focusing on common command arguments. This approach, while noisier, was successful and later refined into a complete analytic.

### Summary

Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) continue to pose a significant threat to enterprise networks. The ATT&CK-based analytics development method is a powerful tool for network defenders to detect these threats without relying on known bad indicators or external breach notifications. MITRE's research, guided by five key principles, has led to the iterative improvement of defensive capabilities through realistic cyber games. The MITRE Cyber Analytic Repository (CAR) serves as a platform for sharing and expanding upon the developed analytics, enhancing the community's ability to detect and respond to APTs.

### Appendix A: Details on MITRE’s Implementation

This appendix provides information about the sensors, data, and analytics used in MITRE's living lab network during the cyber games. The data was collected from real employee workstations, providing a realistic environment for testing and developing analytics.

#### A.1 Example Analytics

**Analytic 1: Suspicious Commands**
- **CAR URL:** https://car.mitre.org/wiki/CAR-2013-04-002
- **Type:** Behavioral
- **Data Required:** Process Creation Events with Command Line Information

This analytic identifies sequences of executed processes that are known to be suspicious. It looks for groups of these processes based on the time between occurrences, parent process, and host, reducing noise and adding context. Examples of suspicious processes include `net.exe`, `reg.exe`, `dsquery.exe`, and `schtasks.exe`. This analytic touches on over 20 different ATT&CK TTPs. For a complete list, refer to the CAR site.
