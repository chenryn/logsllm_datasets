User: How to create a Domain Name Resolution (DNS) record to map local IP to public IP?
Assistant: To map a local IP to a public IP address, you need to create an A record (address record) or CNAME record (alias record) in DNS. Here are some steps: 1. Log into the control panel of your domain registrar or DNS hosting. 2. Find the Domain Name Manager or DNS Manager option and open it. 3. Create a new A record or CNAME record. If you chose an A record, enter your hostname and public IP address in the record. If you choose a CNAME record, you only need to enter your hostname in the record. 4. Save the record and wait for a few minutes so that the new record can propagate on the DNS server and take effect. 5. Test records. You can use command-line tools such as ping or nslookup to test whether the DNS records have been successfully configured.
