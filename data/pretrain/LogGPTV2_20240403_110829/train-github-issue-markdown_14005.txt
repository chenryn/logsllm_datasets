I am using `pandas.__version__==0.14.0`.  
This is my first bug report in github so excuse my possibly poorly formatted
submission.
This bug report might be related to, or duplicate:
  1. #2646
  2. #6501
It was explained to me by [http://stackoverflow.com/users/1427416/brenbarn] on
the following StackOverflow question,
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24683023/having-issue-with-hierarchical-
index-set-behavior/24684844#24684844
Essentially, the following behavior is not desirable:
    print pd.__version__
    WeirdIdx = pd.MultiIndex(levels=[[0], [1]],labels=[[0, 0], [0,0]],names=[u'X', u'Y'])
    print WeirdIdx
    print (0, 0) in WeirdIdx
    print (1, 0) in WeirdIdx
    print (100, 0) in WeirdIdx
    print (100, 100) in WeirdIdx
since it prints:  
0.14.0  
X Y  
0 1  
1  
True  
True  
True  
True
despite the fact that `(100,0)` and `(100,100)` are unambiguously not part of
the index.
