Beyond the Lulz:
Black Hat Trolling, White Hat Trolling, and Hacking the Attention Landscape
SECTION 1
Are you familiar with fishing? Trolling is where you set your 
fishing lines in the water and then slowly go back and forth 
dragging the bait and hoping for a bite. Trolling on the Net is 
the same concept - someone baits a post and then waits for 
the bite on the line and then enjoys the ensuing fight.
- Anonymous usenet poster, 1995 (relayed by Judith Donath, 
Identity and Deception in the Virtual Community, 1998)
The well-constructed troll is a post that induces lots of 
newbies and flamers to make themselves look even more 
clueless than they already do, while subtly conveying to the 
more savvy and experienced that it is in fact a deliberate 
troll. If you don't fall for the joke, you get to be in on it.
- Troller’s FAQ by PI:EMAIL, 1996
Being a prick on the internet because you can. Typically 
unleashing one or more cynical or sarcastic remarks on an 
innocent by-stander, because it’s the internet and, hey, you 
can.
- EREALLY GUD DEFUNITION MAKUR, Urban Dictionary, 2004
A smart vendor treats vulnerabilities less as a software 
problem, and more as a PR problem. So if we, the user 
community, want software vendors to patch vulnerabilities, 
we need to make the PR problem more acute.
- Bruce Schneier, 2007
Laughter at the expense or misfortune of others.
- A troll to Gabriella Coleman, 
Hacker, Hoaxer, Whistleblower, Spy, 2014
Part of:
a rich aesthetic tradition of spectacle and transgression... 
which includes the irreverent legacy of phreakers and the 
hacker underground.
- Gabriella Coleman, Phreaks, Hackers, and Trolls: The 
Politics of Transgression and Spectacle,’ 2012
The best challenge to the authority of something is to find where 
its semantic or enforceable borders break down and to exploit 
those shortcomings.
- Brad Troemel, proclaimed the “Troll of Internet Art,” 2012
We’ve come up with the menacing term 'troll' for someone 
who spreads hate and does other horrible things 
anonymously on the internet.
- Adrian Chen, MIT Technology Review, 2014
Until sensationalist, exploitative media practices are no longer 
rewarded with page views and ad revenue—in short, until the 
mainstream is willing to step in front of the funhouse mirror and 
consider the contours of its own distorted reflection—the most 
aggressive forms of trolling will always have an outlet, and an 
audience.
- Whitney Phillips, This Is Why We Can’t Have Nice Things, 2015
- Users looking to govern or police their communities
- Hackers looking to corral attention or pressure vendors
- Subcultural trolls looking for ‘lulz’
- Artists looking to critique cultural practices
- Political actors looking to destabilize public sphere
- Political actors looking to corral attention or attack opponents

technical systems

SECTION 2
WHITE HAT TROLL?
• Agenda Setting (from below)
• Attention is a scarce resource (attention economics)
• Legacy gatekeepers (media) compete with an emergent class 
of network (social media) gatekeepers to direct attention.
• Trolling as social engineering: gaining access (via gatekeepers) 
to the resources of a closed system (their audience) 
• Newspaper editors and reporters
• Platform designers / vendors
• Platform algorithms
• Content moderators
• Advertisers
• Anyone with framing or curating capacity (i.e.: Users)
Karine Barzilai-Nahon, 2008
• Exploiting or detourning gatekeeper vulnerabilities to affect 
readers / users
• Eliciting changes to gatekeeping practices
• Disclosing dynamics inherent to gatekeeping
• Posing as gatekeepers
• Capturing legacy gatekeeper resources / audiences

• Network curation
• Asymmetric cost to debunk
• Automated amplification (bots)
• Adtech
• Context collapse / Poe’s Law / Anonymity
• Pepe as a Trojan Horse
• Vulnerabilities all the way down?
• Where does securitization stop?
• What is gatekeeper responsibility to users?
• Is this codified? How?
• Is paternalistic gatekeeping inherently authoritarian?
• Is network gatekeeping inherently democratic?
• When is gatekeeping in the public interest?
SECTION 3

• Push private agenda
• Counter to target’s interest
• Non-prescribed engagement
• Demonstrate attack surface (proof of concept)

• Sense of public interest?
• Align system with intent
• Disclose vulnerabilities selectively to platforms / journalists
• Disable possibility of non-prescribed engagement through 
research and education
• Reduce attack surface
• Create a discursive “patch” (i.e. Godwin’s Law)
• Who?
• What are the incentives?
• Who is being tasked to respond?
• What is the form of disclosure?
• Whose interest is served?
• How do ”the lulz” figure in?
• What are the ethics of fun at others’ expense?
• Has the adoption of trolling as a propaganda technique by 
states and political radicals changed the possibility of just 
“doing it for the lulz”?  Hacking for fun?

dynamics are supposed to work?

• Technical re-design
• Policy change
• Content moderation
• Media literacy (for users and gatekeepers?)
• Norms like “Don’t Feed the Trolls” / “Strategic silence”
• Regulation
• Institutionalized trust and verification
• Right to speech ≠ Right to amplification?
• Media Literacy vs. Attention Economics?
• Network Gatekeeping vs. Paternalism?
• What Public Interest? What Ethical system? Which Establishment?
• Who discloses, how, to whom, to what end?
• Right to free speech with your one mouth?
• Right to amplification of that speech?
• Monopolization of attention = DOS of other’s 
free speech?
• Finite lifetime problem
• Can’t verify/investigate every claim
• Inflammatory lies stickier and more profitable
• Moderation under counts
• No moderation over counts
