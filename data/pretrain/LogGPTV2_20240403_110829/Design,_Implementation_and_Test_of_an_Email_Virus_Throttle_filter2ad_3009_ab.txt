Figure 5. Delays for single recipient mails as
the working set size is varied. The plots show
three different measures of delay:
the per-
centage of mails delayed (top), the average
delay per mail sent (middle) and the average
delay of those mails delayed (bottom). The
different lines correspond to different users.
The plots show that for some users the effect
of the working set is strong, but for others
it makes little difference. Overall the delays
are small, with delays on mails in the range
of 10–25 seconds. For this plot maxSlack  1
and the allowed rate was 1 per minute.
Figure 6. Delays for multiple mails as a func-
tion of maxMSlack. This parameter is the
maximum amount of “credit” that a user can
build up in order to allow a multiple recipient
mail to be sent.
It is also the maximum size
of multiple mail that can be sent without de-
lay. As this parameter increases the delays
go down, with the value of 15 giving reason-
able delays for all users. The worst affected
user is an administrative assistant. The bot-
tom plot is noisy for higher values of maxM-
Slack because so few mails are delayed. For
this plot the allowed rate was 1 recipient per
minute.
a per user basis. It is however important to keep this pa-
rameter low as it is the number of “free” recipients an email
virus could attempt to infect.
Figure 7 shows the effect of the allowed rate on delays
for both single and multiple messages combined. For ease
of implementation the allowed rates are made the same for
both types of email (although there is no reason in princi-
ple why they could not be different). The plot shows that a
value of approximately 1 mail/minute or 1 recipient/minute
is reasonable, giving delays of under 5 minutes for most
users, and up to 10 minutes for some, with around 0.5–3%
of mails delayed. Reducing the allowed rate to say 1 mail
every 2 minutes increases the number of mails delayed sig-
niﬁcantly.
The ﬁnal parameter is the stop limit. Figure 8 shows the
number of false alarms (where the throttle stops legitimate
mailing activity) per month that each user would experience
as a function of the threshold value. There is signiﬁcant
variation between users, so for example a threshold of 20
would give no false alarms for most users, and occasional
alarms for some. One user would have one alarm per month,
which is again not excessive.
For reasonable settings of these parameters, the delays
5 min-
for single and multiple mails are generally low ( 
utes for most users), and only occur for a small proportion
of emails. The question is whether these delays are accept-
able. They are certainly of the same order as the transit time
for emails through the email system, and would to a large

extent be invisible to the sender (they occur after the mail
has been sent, and the sender does not normally know when
the email will be read by the recipient). A recent study
of timings in email [21] showed that the speed that users
replied to mails was highly context dependent, e.g. they re-
ply quickly to senior managers, but slower to more lowly
colleagues. Given that the delays from the throttle are not
large, and users can always override it if necessary, the de-
lays introduced by the throttle should not have a large effect
on the usability of the email system.
5 Implementation
In order to throttle email effectively, the throttle needs
to be able to determine the sender of each email so that it
can enforce the allowed rate per sender. If a virus could
“spoof” the sender then it could send messages at a higher
rate than allowed by making them appear to come from dif-
ferent users.
Reliably identifying the sender informs both where the
throttle should be implemented (best at the point where
email enters the email system as after even one hop reliable
Figure 8. Effect of stop threshold. The plot
shows the number of false alarms per month
that different users would experience for dif-
ferent values of the threshold. For most users
a threshold of 15–20 would give no alarms,
while for others the rate would be around
1 every 3–6 months. One user (an admin-
istrative assistant) would have false alarms
every month, due to sending an email to a
large number of recipients. While it is easiest
if there is a single set of parameters for all
users, it is possible to customise parameters
on a per-user basis.
sender information is lost), and how the sender is identiﬁed.
Figure 9 shows a schematic of outgoing mail systems.
Microsoft Outlook clients use a proprietary protocol to send
mail to an Exchange server [8], which then forwards mail
for remote delivery. To throttle this protocol the throttle
could either be installed on the client or inside the exchange
