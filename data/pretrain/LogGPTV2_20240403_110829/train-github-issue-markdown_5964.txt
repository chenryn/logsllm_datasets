# Description of the new feature/enhancement
Currently in Windows 10, the only way to open the program with a keyboard
shortcut is by:
  * Opening a run prompt and running `shell:AppsFolder`
  * Dragging a shortcut to the desktop
  * Binding keys to this shortcut and leaving it on the desktop
This clutters the desktop unnecessarily and is brittle in that (I suspect) the
folder changes upon update due to the version number in the path (e.g.
`C:\Program
Files\WindowsApps\Microsoft.WindowsTerminal_0.2.1831.0_x64__8wekyb3d8bbwe\...`).
# Technical considerations
It would be great if there was a way to bind a key as part of the install
process or within the settings file, but I realise this may reasonably be
regarded as an OS level concern. I'm stunned that Microsoft doesn't provide a
simple way to do this within Windows, but this is not an issue for the Windows
Terminal team.
I'm sure I could get around this by using something like `AutoHotKey` though,
so I guess we just need a way to reliably derive the path of the
application...
