One of the best features of Deno is allowing us to write JavaScript that both
run at (modern) browsers and server side without building or other works. But
if we write in TypeScript, that's useless for Browsers. (That's why I'd like
to write codes in JS rather then TS.)
If Deno provide an API that accepts TS codes, compile them with inside
compiler, and returns JS codes. We can build a web server to respond JS
modules compiled from TS. Then the TS codes are cross-platform too.
Here is a suggestion:
    Deno.compile( code:string, options?:CompileOption  ):Promise
    Deno.compileFile( filename:string, options?:CompileOption  ):Promise
    Deno.compileSync( code:string, options?:CompileOption  ):string
    Deno.compileFileSync( filename:string, options?:CompileOption  ):string
