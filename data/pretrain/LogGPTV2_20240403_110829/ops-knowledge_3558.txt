User: I'm new to Emacs and I'm trying to set up my python environment. So far I've learned that using "python-mode.el" in a python buffer C-c C-c loads the contents of the current buffer into an interactive python shell, apparently using what which python yields. In my case that is python 3.3.3. But since I need to get a python 2.7 shell, I'm trying to get Emacs to spawn such a shell on C-c C-c. Unfortunatly I can't figure out, how to do this. Setting py-shell-name to what which python2.7 yields (i.e. /usr/bin/python2.7) does not work. How can get Emacs to do this, or how can I trace back what Emacs executes when I hit C-c C-c?
Assistant: I don't use python, but from the source to python-mode, I think you should look into customizing the variable python-python-command - It seems to default to the first path command matching "python"; perhaps you can supply it with a custom path?
