# Quality of Service Metrics and Latency Analysis for Failure Detection in Consensus Algorithms

## Introduction
This document discusses the quality of service (QoS) metrics and latency analysis for a failure detection mechanism in the context of the Chandra-Toueg consensus algorithm. The study combines modeling-based simulations and experimental measurements to evaluate the performance of the algorithm under various conditions.

## QoS Metrics and Failure Detection Timeout

### Figure 8: Quality of Service Metrics
- **Mistake Recurrence Time (TMR)**: This metric measures the time between successive false suspicions.
- **Mistake Duration (TM)**: This metric measures the duration of a false suspicion.

#### (a) Mistake Recurrence Time TMR as a Function of T
- **Processes**: 3, 5, 7, 9, 11
- **Failure Detection Timeout [ms]**: 10

#### (b) Mistake Duration TM as a Function of T
- **Processes**: 3, 5, 7, 9, 11
- **Failure Detection Timeout [ms]**: 10

**Note**: When TMR is large, the corresponding consensus latency values are nearly constant. Therefore, precise determination of TMR (and TM) is not necessary in such cases.

## Latency Analysis

### Table 1: Latency Values (ms) for Various Crash Scenarios
- **Crash Types**: No crash, Coordinator crash, Participant crash
- **Number of Processes (n)**: 3, 5, 7, 9, 11
- **Measurements (meas.) and Simulations (sim.)**

| n | No Crash (meas.) | Coordinator Crash (meas.) | Participant Crash (meas.) | No Crash (sim.) | Coordinator Crash (sim.) | Participant Crash (sim.) |
|---|------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|
| 3 | 1.06             | 1.568                     | 1.115                     | 1.030           | 1.336                    | 0.786                   |
| 5 | 1.43             | 2.245                     | 1.340                     | 1.442           | 2.295                    | 1.336                   |
| 7 | 2.00             | 3.27                      | 3.469                     | -               | -                        | -                       |
| 9 | 2.739            | 1.811                     | 3.049                     | -               | -                        | -                       |
| 11| 2.62             | 3.101                     | 2.400                     | -               | -                        | -                       |

### Figure 9: Latency vs. Failure Detection Timeout
- **Latency Curves**: Each curve starts at high values and decreases rapidly to the latency in the absence of suspicions.
- **Peak at T = 10 ms**: A small peak is observed at T = 10 ms for n = 5 and 7, possibly due to interference with the Linux scheduler, which has a basic scheduling time unit of 10 ms.

### Simulation vs. Measurement Results
- **Differences**: The Stochastic Activity Network (SAN) model does not perfectly capture the influence of failure detectors when wrong suspicions are frequent. At high values of T, where the QoS is good, the results from the SAN model and measurements match.
- **Correlation Among Failure Detectors**: The assumption of independence among failure detectors is not correct. Future work will focus on accounting for this correlation.

## Conclusion
- **Performance Metric**: Latency is identified as a key performance metric, reflecting the time needed for the algorithm to reach a decision.
- **Future Work**: The study opens up many interesting questions and directions, including the introduction of new performance metrics (e.g., throughput) and deeper investigation of the algorithm's behavior under specific conditions (e.g., transient behavior after crashes).
- **Validation**: The validation activity highlighted some limitations of the model, such as the independence assumption, and suggested new directions for measurements, such as extracting distributions for the QoS metrics of failure detectors.
