**VSCode Version:** 0.10.11  
**OS Version:** Windows 10 Pro

### Issue Description
In an HTML document, JavaScript functions are not displayed when using the `.` operator inside a code block (```). For example, in version 0.10.6, I could use:

```html
<script>
    console.log("Hello, World!");
</script>
```

However, in the current version (0.10.11), the functions are not shown. I have tried installing various extensions to mitigate this issue, but it persists.

### Update
- When working within the ```<script>``` tag in an HTML file, the JavaScript functions do not appear.
- If I change the language mode to JavaScript (by selecting it from the bottom right corner of the editor), the functions appear correctly, but the editor marks syntax errors throughout the document.
- A temporary solution is to set the language mode back to HTML and restart VS Code, but this is not ideal.

Has anyone else experienced this problem?
