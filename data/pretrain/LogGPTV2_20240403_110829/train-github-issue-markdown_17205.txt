  * VSCode Version: 0.10.11
  * OS Version: Windows 10 pro
In HTML document the functions in JavaScript are not displayed when using
operator "." inside of `` label. For example, in version
0.10.6 I can use:
``
However, in the current version, the functions are not shown. I have tried to
install extensions to try to mitigate it, but the problem persists.
Any of you have the same problem?
Update:
When working in HTML within the `` tag functions do not appear, but.
if the language is changed to JavaScript on the bottom right, the functions
appear correctly, but marks syntax errors throughout the document, the
solution to this is to set the language HTML and restart VS Code.
