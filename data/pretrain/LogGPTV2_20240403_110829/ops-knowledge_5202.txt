User: I'm using cx_Freeze to compile Python programs into executables and it works just fine, but the problem is that it doesn't compile the program into one EXE, it converts them into a .exe file AND a whole bunch of .dll files including python32.dll that are necessary for the program to run.
Does anyone know how I can package all of these files into one .exe file? I would rather it be a plain EXE file and not just a file that copies the DLLs into a temporary directory in order to launch the program.
EDIT: This is in reference to Python 3
Assistant: Have you tried innosetup? It can create installer files from the output of cxfreeze. There might be an option somewhere to bundle everything into one file.
