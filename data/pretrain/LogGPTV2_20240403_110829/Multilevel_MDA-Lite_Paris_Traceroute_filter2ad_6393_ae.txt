was a slow increase with each successive round. The additional
probing for each round was less than 10% of the basic MDA-Lite
Paris Traceroute probing.
These results indicate that we can glean router-level information
with a modest amount of additional probing, typically 20% more is
enough to get a precision and a recall greater than 92% with respect
to round 10, and 75% more to complete the ten rounds. Additional
work will be required in order to better establish a firm basis against
which to compare, so as to provide clearer guidance on the tradeoff
between probing and the completeness and accuracy of the results.
We also looked at the potential benefits and costs of adding
direct probing, as we had implemented MMLPT with only indirect
probing, for the MBT. For each diamond, MMLPT identifies zero
or more address sets as routers, validating or rejecting address sets

19, 37] mentioned in the Related Work section.
Our focus is on the “diamonds” (see Sec. 2.1 for the definition) that
are encountered in a route trace. We define a a distinct diamond
by its divergence point and its convergence point. This means that
if a diamond is encountered multiple times in the course of a sur-
vey, there might be differences in its measured internal topology
from one encounter to the next. If either a divergence point or a
convergence point is non-responsive (a “star” in common parlance),
we consider it as different from a diamond that has responsive di-
vergence and convergence points, even if the two diamonds have
other IP addresses in common. Since a diamond might show up in
multiple measurements, we define each encounter with a distinct
diamond to be a measured diamond. Each way of counting re-
flects a different view of what is important to consider: the number
of such topologies, or the likelihood of encountering one. We look
at both.
The surveys describe how large diamonds are, both in number
of hops and in number of vertices at a given hop. Also, because
we have found that “uniformity” and “meshing” are relevant to the
ability to economize on probes when tracing at the IP level (see
Sec. 2.2), we describe these features. For the metric definitions that
follow, we apply those of Augustin et al. [19] for “maximum width”
and “maximum length” and add “maximum width asymmetry” and
“ratio of meshed hops”. As illustrated in Fig. 6, these are:
The maximum width is the maximum number of vertices that
can be found at a single hop, as in the boxed hop of the left-hand
diamond.
The maximum length is the length of the longest path between
the divergence and the convergence point, as shown by the set of
bold edges in the left-hand diamond.
The maximum width asymmetry is a topological indicator of
a lack of uniformity. We define it first for a pair of hops i and i + 1.
• If hop i has fewer vertices than hop i + 1, it is the maximum
difference in the number of successors between two vertices
at hop i.
• If hop i has more vertices than hop i + 1, it is the maxi-
mum difference in the number of predecessors between two
vertices at hop i + 1.
• If hops i and i + 1 have identical numbers of vertices, it is
the maximum of the two values described above.
For a diamond as a whole, it is the largest value of maximum width
asymmetry found across all hop pairs, as shown by the grey and
black vertices of the left-hand diamond.
The ratio of meshed hops of a diamond is the portion of hop
pairs of hops that are meshed, as shown in the right-hand diamond,
in which two of the five hop pairs are meshed, for a ratio of 0.4.
5.1 IP level survey
The IP level survey is based on multipath route traces from 35
sources towards 350,000 destinations during two weeks starting 8
March 2018.
The route tracing tool was the libparistraceroute-based MDA
Paris Traceroute [7], using its default parameters. We employed
UDP probes, as Luckie et al. [36] found best results for discovering
load balanced paths with such probes.
The sources were PlanetLab nodes running Fedora 24 or 25,
obtained through PlanetLab Europe [10]. (We also ran a survey
with similar results, which can be found at the URL mentioned at
the end of Sec. 1, on the new EdgeNet infrastructure [3] affiliated
with PlanetLab Europe.)
The destinations were chosen at random from the IPv4 addresses
rated as “highly responsive” in the Internet Address Hitlist Impact
dataset Internet_address_hitlist_it78w-20171113, ID DS-822, cov-
ering 17 January 2015 to 15 December 2017 [13].
We discarded route traces that we could not collect because of
infrastructure troubles, yielding 294,832 exploitable results, among
which 155,030 passed through at least one per-flow load balancer.
There were 60,921 distinct and 220,193 measured diamonds.

Uniformity. In both measured and distinct diamond asymme-
try distributions (Fig. 7), 89% of diamonds have zero asymmetry.
This means that most diamonds are uniform, provided that load
balancing is uniform across next hop interfaces, and supports the
MDA-Lite’s assumption of uniformity. But if the MDA-Lite cannot
detect the asymmetry in a diamond that is among the 11% that are
asymmetric, it will not switch over to the full MDA and it risks
failing to discover the full topology. It is most likely to encounter
difficulty on an unmeshed diamond, as, when meshing is detected,
the full MDA is invoked. Only 2.3% of measured and 3.6% of distinct
diamonds are both asymmetric and unmeshed. We examined these
diamonds for differences in discovery probability among vertices
at a common hop, plotting the CDFs of all non-zero probability
differences in Fig. 8. In these cases, 90% of measured and 58% of
distinct diamonds have a maximum probability difference of 0.25
and, for both, 99% have a maximum probability difference of 0.5.
This indicates that the MDA-Lite is very unlikely to fail in uncover-
ing a lack of uniformity, which is borne out by our experimental
results in Sec. 2.4. This issue could be more rigorously studied with
further mathematical analysis.

Figure 9: Ratio of meshed hops
Meshing. Of the 220,193 measured diamonds in our survey, 32,430
present at least one meshed hop, and of the 60,921 distinct diamonds,
19,138 are meshed. Fig. 9 plots CDFs of the ratio of meshed hops
for the meshed diamonds. The MDA-Lite offers probe savings over
the full MDA when a pair of hops is not meshed. More than 80% of
meshed diamonds have a ratio of of meshed hops under 0.4, which
indicates a significant potential for the MDA-Lite to realize signif-
icant probe savings, even on meshed diamonds. We continue by
looking at the length and width metrics, for which the distributions
are shown in Fig. 10. Almost half of both measured and distinct
diamonds have a maximum length of 2, meaning that they consist
of a divergence point, a single multi-vertex hop, and a convergence
point. The MDA-Lite is more economical than the full MDA on such
diamonds. The largest value of maximum width encountered is 96.
Such a high value is unprecedented, with earlier surveys [19, 37]
reporting maximum widths of at most 16. A notable feature of the
maximum width distributions is their peaks at 48 and 56. Further
investigation indicates that the distinct diamond distribution might
be overstating what is in fact being encountered by the route traces.
Though the diamonds are distinct by our definition, meaning that
they have a unique pair of divergence and convergence points, they

Figure 11: Maximum length and maximum width joint dis-
tributions
Looking at the joint distributions of maximum width and max-
imum length (Fig. 11), we see that short and narrow diamonds
continue to be the most common, as found in previous surveys.
For example, we found that 24.2% of measured and 27.4% of dis-
tinct diamonds were of maximum length 2 and maximum width
2, corresponding to the simplest possible diamond. The maximum
width 48 and 56 diamonds also reveal themselves to have a variety
of different maximum lengths.
5.2 Router level survey
The router level survey is based upon the 155,030 route traces from
the IP level survey that passed through at least one load balancer.
We retraced these with Mutilevel MDA-Lite Paris Traceroute during
two weeks, starting on 3 April 2018. For each trace, we obtained IP
level output and router level output.
We found 646 cases of distinct address sets (0.98% of the total
alias set) that were considered as aliases by one measurement, but

Table 3: Effect of alias resolution on unique diamonds
discarded or not found by another, although they had both seen
the entire address set at the IP level. A deeper analysis showed that
295 of those cases were due to a constant 0 IP ID series collected
by one measurement for at least one address in the address set,
whereas the other measurement could build a monotonic IP ID time
series for each of the addresses in the address set. The remaining
351 cases were false positives, which were then discarded from the
router dataset analysed in this section.
We looked at what we term the “size” of the routers that were
found, the size being the number of IP interfaces identified as be-
longing to a router. A route trace from a given vantage point is
bound to pick up mostly the ingress interfaces facing that point,
which tend to be the ones from which it receives responses, and so
this metric will be an underestimate of the true number of inter-
faces. We also aggregated the IP interface sets from multiple traces
through transitive closure based upon two sets having at least one
address in common, which may give less of an underestimate, but
is still incomplete, as we do not perform full alias resolution on
the overall IP addresses set found. CDFs of the sizes are shown in
Fig. 12. 68% of the routers had a size of 2 and 97% had a size of 10 or
less. We found 1 distinct router with more than 50 interfaces, and 5
such routers when we aggregated the address sets.
We looked at what happens to each IP level diamond when it is
resolved into a router level diamond. There are four possibilities:
(1) there is no alias resolution, so the diamond remains the same;
(2) the diamond resolves into a single smaller diamond; (3) the
diamond resolves into a series of smaller diamonds; (4) the diamond
disappears completely, being resolved into a straight path of routers.
As Table 3 shows, some degree of router resolution takes place on
41.9% of unique diamonds. In comparison, Marchetta et al. [37] saw,
in 2016, a 33% reduction in diamond max-width, when applying
Midar a posteriori to multipath route traces.
Figure 14: Joint distribution of maximum width before and
after alias resolution
We looked at the effect of alias resolution on diamond width.
Fig. 13 plots the distributions obtained by the MDA-Lite before and
after alias resolution. We observe that the peak at maximum width
48 has remained, whereas the one at 56 has disappeared. On closer
inspection, we find that the max width 56 diamond at the IP level
resolved into several smaller diamonds at the router level. These
router-level diamonds were of unaggregated sizes between 2 and
49 IPs.
Finally, we looked at width reduction diamond by diamond.
Fig. 14 plots the joint distribution of maximum width before and
after alias resolution of those diamonds that changed size. Large
width reductions are rare, but do take place. The darker grey verti-
cal series of values just to the left of 60 show the maximum width 56
diamonds being broken down into smaller diamonds at the router
level.
