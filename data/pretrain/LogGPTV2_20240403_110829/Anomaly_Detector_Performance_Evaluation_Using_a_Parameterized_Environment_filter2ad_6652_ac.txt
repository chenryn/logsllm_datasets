CF P and CF N are the cost coeﬃcients for false-positive and false-negative
errors. Also, NF P , NT P , NF N and NT N are the number of false-positives, true
positives, false negatives and true negatives in the experiment.
To illustrate the diﬀerence between conditional and absolute cost, consider an
email classiﬁer for detecting spam. Using the conditional cost formula, the cost
computed for a detector on email received by a user would not depend on the
ratio of spam to non-spam email that the user receives. In contrast, the absolute
cost would change, depending on that ratio. The conditional cost is appropriate
when we are interested purely in the ability of the detector to distinguish spam
from non-spam, but the absolute cost is appropriate when we want to evaluate
the impact of detector tuning on a speciﬁc user. The absolute cost allows users
to tune their classiﬁers depending on how much spam they receive (for example,
with CF P representing the number of minutes to deal with non-spam being
treated as spam, and CF N representing the number of minutes to deal with
spam being treated as non-spam).
In this paper we will use the absolute probability based cost function, and
assume that CF P = CF N = 1. Under these conditions we would expect a cost
of zero to represent perfect performance and a cost of 0.5 to represent the cost
of a random detector. A cost greater than 0.5 would correspond to a degen-
erate detector in which inverting the output would improve performance since
NF P +NF N
NF P +NF N +NT P +NT N
> 0.5 implies that
NT P +NT N
NF P +NF N +NT P +NT N
< 0.5.
6 Results and Discussion
In this section we discuss the results of our detector performance analysis ex-
periments. We performed three sets of experiments:
– Cost analysis experiments, showing the best-case detection capabilities as a
function of the environment.
– Tuning experiments, showing the best tuning of the detector as a function
of the environment.
– Validation experiments, showing a comparison of the results from the syn-
thetic data with the results from real-world data.

In doing these experiments we noted two signiﬁcant blind spots in RIDES. Re-
gardless of how RIDES is tuned, or of the data set on which RIDES is deployed,
RIDES cannot detect anomalies (i.e., it is equivalent to a random detector) when
(1) the anomaly saturation (λa) is low, and (2) when the block size (B) is small.
This means that if an attack manifests as, for example, a single or small number
of foreign symbols, RIDES will be completely blind to the attack. The reasons
for these blind spots will be discussed in the next section.
6.1 Cost Analysis
Figure 2 shows the detector error cost with respect to a foreign symbol injection.
The cost is plotted as a function of the block size B and the foreign symbol
saturation λa. For each point (B, λa) on the surface, the lowest cost over all
possible detector tunings (Hst, T ) is shown. As expected, as the foreign symbol
saturation goes to zero, the detector performance approaches that of a random
detector (cost is 0.5). This is because at the point where λa = 0, the normal
and anomalous blocks have identical statistical characteristics and no detector
could be expected to discriminate between the two blocks. As the foreign symbol
saturation λa increases, the error cost rapidly decreases. Notice also that small
block sizes make it diﬃcult to detect an injection.

Fig. 2. Cost function for foreign-symbol injections
When the block size is small, there will be many transitions between normal
and anomalous blocks. RIDES, like most frequency-based detectors, uses a win-
dow of recent observations on which to make an alarm decision. It will frequently
be the case that while the leading edge of the window is in one block (normal or
anomalous), much of the detector window will still be in the previous block of
the opposite type. In such cases, the short-term model will still be primarily in-
ﬂuenced by the previous block, but detector output will be judged based on the
120

ground truth of the current block. On transitions from normal blocks to anoma-
lous blocks, there will be many misses until a suﬃcient fraction of the detector
window has moved into the anomalous block. Conversely, on transitions from
anomalous blocks to normal blocks there will be many false alarms. The most
signiﬁcant implication of this result is that frequency-based detectors can be
expected to perform poorly in environments with short and/or frequent attacks,
but more favorably when attacks are less frequent and longer in duration.

Fig. 3. Comparison of detection cost by injection type
Results for rare and uncommon symbol injections were very similar to re-
sults for the foreign symbol injections discussed above, diﬀering primarily in the
steepness of the curve. Figure 3 shows a comparison of the detection cost as a
function of saturation for the three injection types. Notice that all of the curves
have the same basic shape, with the foreign symbol injection having the fastest
improvement in detection performance (fastest decrease in cost) as the satura-
tion increases. The key feature to note is the consistent shape of these curves.
We expect the exact relative position of the three curves to be aﬀected by the
selection of both the MAXSUMRAREPROB and the probability cutoﬀ for the
uncommon type. This is because these constants control the numbers of symbol
types in each of these categories, and distributing an injection with a speciﬁc
saturation over fewer types will result in more instances of a symbol per type.
6.2 Detector Tuning
Given the synthetic environment we have created to assess RIDES, we ﬁnd that
we can identify the lowest cost parameter setting for a particular environment
setting. This amounts to tuning the detector to ﬁnd an optimal short-term half-
life (Hst) and detection threshold (T ). Figures 4(a) and 4(b) show the optimal
short-term half-life and optimal detection threshold, respectively, as a function of
the block size B and the foreign-symbol saturation λa. The optimal values were
determined by trying all combinations of the short-term half-lives and thresholds
shown in Table 2, and selecting the settings that resulted in the lowest cost.

Fig. 4. Optimal short-term half-life (left) and optimal detection threshold (right) as a
function of the block size B and the foreign symbol saturation λa
Except for some noise at very low saturation values in the optimal short-term
half-life surface (Figure 4(a)), we notice that we get better convergence to an
optimal short-term half-life than to an optimal threshold as is evident from the
smoother appearance of the optimal short-term half-life surface compared to the
optimal threshold surface (Figure 4(b)). To investigate the cause of the poor
convergence of the threshold value, we generated a graph of cost as a function of
the detector tuning (Figure 5). This graph corresponds to the case in which the
block size B was 900 and the foreign-symbol saturation λa was 0.3. Two possible
explanations for the threshold convergence problem suggested by this graph are:
– Multiple minima – Notice that the minimum cost on the Hst = 15 curve
with a threshold value near 2.5, and the minimum cost the Hst = 25 curve
with a threshold value near 3.99 are nearly identical. In essence, relatively
