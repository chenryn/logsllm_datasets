anomaly was detected, the passenger was given a manual
pat down to determine whether it was a threat [45]. The
Secure 1000 was used in place of a walk-through metal
detector, rather than both screening methods being em-
ployed sequentially [48]. We focus our analysis on threats
relevant to an airport security context, such as weapons
and explosives, as opposed to other contraband such as
illicit drugs or bulk currency.
To replicate a realistic screening environment, we situ-
ated our Secure 1000 in an open area, oriented 2.5 m from
a concrete wall sufﬁcient to backstop X-ray radiation.
This distance accords with the manufacturer’s recommen-
dation of at least 2 m of open area “for producing the
best possible images” [35]. For typical tests, we arranged
the subject at a distance of about 38 cm in front of the
scanner using the foot position template provided with
the machine.
Naïve adversary. First, we consider the scanner’s ef-
fectiveness against a naïve adversary, an attacker whose
tactics do not change in response to the introduction of
the device. Although this is a weak attacker, it seems
to correspond to the threat model under which the scan-
ner was ﬁrst tested by the government, in a 1991 study
of a prototype of the Secure 1000 conducted by Sandia
National Laboratories [22]. Our results under this threat
model generally comport with theirs. Guns, knives, and
blocks of explosives naïvely carried on the front or back
of the subject’s body are visible to the scanner operator.
Three effects contribute to the detectability of contra-
band. The ﬁrst is contrast: human skin appears white
as it backscatters most incident X-ray radiation, while
metals, ceramics, and bone absorb X-rays and so appear
dark gray or black. The second is shadows cast by three-
dimensional objects as they block the X-ray beam, which
accentuate their edges. The third is distortion of the sub-
ject’s ﬂesh as a result of the weight of the contraband or
the mechanics of its attachment. The naïve adversary is
unlikely to avoid all three effects by chance.
A successful detection of hidden contraband can be
seen in Figure 1. The subject has concealed a .380 ACP
pistol within his waistband. The X-ray beam interacts
with the gun metal signiﬁcantly differently than the sur-
rounding ﬂesh, and the sharp contrast in backscatter in-
tensity is immediately noticeable.
Adaptive adversary. Of course, real attackers are not
entirely ignorant of the scanner. The TSA announced

ant, and the main user interface is a 640× 480 pixel, 4-bit
grayscale screen, as shown in Figure 3. The operator
invokes a scan by pressing a hand switch. After image ac-
quisition, the operator can inspect the scan by means of a
2× zoom and interactive brightness and contrast controls.
The image can also be saved to disk or printed. Further,
the software contains several calibration functions that
can only be accessed by entering a 4 digit numeric pass-
word. The password is hard-coded and is printed in the
maintenance manual.
Scanner unit. The scanner unit contains an assortment
of electrical and mechanical systems under the control of
an embedded computer called the System Control Board
(SCB). The SCB houses an Intel N80C196KB12 micro-
controller, executing software contained on a 32 KiB sock-
eted ROM. It interacts with the user console PC over a
bidirectional RS-232 serial link using simple ASCII com-
mands such as SU for “scan up” and SD for “scan down.”
In turn, the SCB uses digital and analog interfaces to
direct and monitor other components, including the X-
ray tube, PMTs, and chopper wheel. It also implements
hardware-based safety interlocks on the production of
X-rays, which we discuss further in Section 4.2.
To control vertical movement of the X-ray tube, the
scanner unit uses an off-the-shelf reprogrammable servo
motor controller, the Parker Gemini GV6. In normal op-
eration, the servo controller allows the SCB to trigger a
movement of the X-ray tube, initially to a “home” posi-
tion and subsequently to scan up and down at predeﬁned
rates. There is no command to move the tube to a speciﬁc
intermediate position.

that it would be used at screening checkpoints [12, 48],
the backscatter imaging mechanism is documented in
patents and manufacturer reports [16, 24, 36], images cap-
tured with the device have appeared in the media [12, 25],
and the physics of backscatter X-rays are well under-
stood [2, 7, 22]. We must assume that attackers have such
information and adapt their tactics in response.
To simulate an adaptive adversary, we performed ex-
periments in the style of white-box penetration testing
commonly employed in the computer security ﬁeld. We
allowed ourselves complete knowledge of how the scan-
ner operates as well as the ability to perform test scans,
observed the resulting images, and used them to adjust
our concealment methods.
Such interactive testing is not strictly necessary to de-
velop clever attacks. Indeed, researchers with no access to
the Secure 1000 have proposed a number of concealment
strategies based only on published information [21], and
we experimentally conﬁrm that several of these attacks are
viable. However, the ability to perform tests substantially
increases the probability that an attack will succeed on
the ﬁrst attempt against a real deployment. A determined
adversary might acquire this level of access in several
ways: by buying a machine, as we did; by colluding with
a dishonest operator; or by probing the security of real
installations over time.
In the remainder of this section, we describe experi-
ments with three adaptive concealment techniques and
show that they can be used to defeat the Secure 1000. We
successfully use them to smuggle ﬁrearms, knives, and
explosive simulants past the scanner.
3.1 Concealment by Positioning
The ﬁrst concealment technique makes use of a crucial
observation about X-ray physics: backscatter screening
machines emitting X-rays in the 50 keV range, such as the
Secure 1000, cannot differentiate between the absence of
matter and the existence of materials with high Zeff (e.g.,
iron and lead). That is, when the scanner emits probing
X-rays in a direction and receives no backscatter, it can

either be because the beam interacted with nothing, i.e.,
traveled unimpeded past the screening subject, or because
the beam shone directly upon a material which absorbed
it entirely and thus did not backscatter. In either case, the
resulting pixels will be dark.
These facts lead directly to a straightforward conceal-
ment attack for high Zeff contraband: position the ob-
ject such that it avoids occluding the carrier’s body with
respect to the X-ray beam. This technique was ﬁrst
suggested on theoretical grounds by Kaufman and Carl-
son [21]. In limited trials, a TSA critic used it to smuggle
small metal objects through airport checkpoints equipped
with the Secure 1000 and other AITs [8]. Note that this at-
tack is not enabled by a poor choice of image background
color; as discussed above, the scanner cannot differentiate
between the metal objects and the absence of material.
To more fully investigate this attack, we obtained a set
of weapons: both knives and ﬁrearms, ranging from a
.380 ACP pistol to an AR-15 semi-automatic riﬂe. When
we scanned the weapons against a dark backdrop, most
of the ﬁrearms were readily visible due to the presence
of nonmetallic parts. After testing a number of ﬁrearms,
we settled on our .380 ACP pistol as the most suitable
candidate for concealment.
We performed several trials to test different placement
and attachment strategies. In the end, we achieved excel-
lent results with two approaches: carefully afﬁxing the
pistol to the outside of the leg just above the knee using
tape, and sewing it inside the pant leg near the same loca-
tion. Front and back scans for both methods are shown in
Figure 4. In each case, the pistol is invisible against the
dark background, and the attachment method leaves no
other indication of the weapon’s presence.
In a similar test, we concealed an 11 cm metal folding
knife, in its closed position, along our test subject’s side.
In this case, too, front and back scans were completely
unable to detect the weapon.
Fortunately, simple procedural changes can thwart
these attacks. Instead of performing only front and back
scans, every subject could also be made to undergo scans
from the left and right sides. Under these scans, a high
Zeff weapon positioned on the side of the body would
be as obvious as the one in Figure 1. Unfortunately,
these additional scans would nearly halve the maximum
throughput of the checkpoint, as well as double each per-
son’s radiation dose. Another possible mitigation would
be to screen each subject with a magnetometer, which
would unequivocally ﬁnd metallic contraband but would
fail to uncover more exotic weapons, such as ceramic
knives [50, 54]. We note that the attacker’s gait or ap-
pearance might be compromised by the mass and bulk
of the ﬁrearm or knife, and this might be noticeable to
security personnel outside of the backscatter X-ray screen-
ing.
3.2 Concealment by Masking
The second object concealment techniques we attempted
are similarly based on X-ray physics: the brightness of a
material in the image is directly correlated to its backscat-
ter intensity, which in turn is determined by the Zeff and
density of the matter in the path of the beam. Therefore,
any combination of substances which scatter incoming
X-rays at the same approximate intensity as human ﬂesh
will be indistinguishable from the rest of the human.
One consequence of this fact is that high-Zeff contra-
band can be concealed by masking it with an appropriate
thickness of low-Zeff material. We experimented with
several masking materials to ﬁnd one with a Zeff value
close to that of ﬂesh. We obtained good results with the
common plastic PTFE (Teﬂon), although due to its low
density a signiﬁcant thickness is required to completely
mask a metallic object.
To work around this issue, we took advantage of the Se-
cure 1000’s ability to see bones close to the skin. Figure 5
demonstrates this approach: an 18 cm knife is afﬁxed to
the spine and covered with 1.5 cm of PTFE. As the X-rays
penetrate through the material, they backscatter so that the
knife outline approximates our subject’s spine. While this
mask arrangement creates hard edges and shadows which
render it noticeable to screening personnel these effects
could be reduced by tapering the edges of the mask.
A more difﬁcult challenge for the attacker is taking
into account the anatomy of the speciﬁc person being
imaged. Shallow bones and other dense tissue are visible
to the scanner under normal conditions, and a poorly
conﬁgured mask will stand out against these darker areas
of the scan. We conclude that masking can be an effective
concealment technique, but achieving high conﬁdence of
success would require access to a scanner for testing.
3.3 Concealment by Shaping
Our third and ﬁnal concealment technique applies a strat-
egy ﬁrst theorized in [21] to hide malleable, low-Zeff con-
traband, such as plastic explosives. These materials pro-
duce low contrast against human ﬂesh, and, unlike rigid
weapons, the attacker can reshape them so that they match
the contours of the body.
To experiment with this technique, we acquired radi-
ological simulants for both Composition C-4 [56] and
Semtex [57], two common plastic high explosives. These
simulants are designed to emulate the plastic explosives
with respect to X-ray interactions, and both are composed
of moldable putty, similar to the actual explosive materi-
als. We imaged both C-4 and Semtex simulants with the
Secure 1000, and found that they appear very similar. We
selected the C-4 simulant for subsequent tests.
Our initial plan was to modify the simulants’ Zeff to
better match that of ﬂesh, by thoroughly mixing in ﬁne
metallic powder. To our surprise, however, a thin pancake

Figure 5: Concealing a Knife by Masking — We ﬁnd that high-Zeff materials can be hidden by covering them with lower Zeff
materials, such as the common plastic PTFE (Teﬂon). For example, a metal knife is clearly visible when naïvely concealed, but when
covered with a thin plastic block it approximates the color of the spine. Tapering the block’s edges would reduce the visible outline.
(about 1 cm) of unmodiﬁed C-4 simulant almost perfectly
approximated the backscatter intensity of our subject’s
abdomen.
We afﬁxed the pancake with tape (which is invisible to
the Secure 1000), and faced two further problems. First,
the pancake covered our subject’s navel, which is nor-
mally clearly visible as a small black area in the scans.
Second, by design, plastic explosives are almost com-
pletely inert without a matching detonator. These prob-
lems neatly solve each other: we attached a detonator,
consisting of a small explosive charge in a metal shell,
directly over our subject’s navel. Since the detonator is
coated in metal, it absorbs X-rays quite well and mimics
the look of the navel in the ﬁnal image.
Figure 6 shows a side-by-side comparison of our test
subject both carrying no contraband and carrying 200 g of
C-4 explosive and attached detonator. To put this amount
in perspective, “Shoe Bomber” Richard Reid reportedly
carried about 280 g of explosive material [6], and the
bomb that destroyed Pan Am Flight 103 is thought to
have contained 350 g of Semtex [55].
These scans indicate that plastic explosives can be
smuggled through a Secure 1000 screening, since thin
pancakes of these materials do not contrast strongly with
ﬂesh. While a metal detector would have been sufﬁcient
to detect the detonator we used, not all detonators have
signiﬁcant metal components.
In summary, an adaptive adversary can use several attack
techniques to carry knives, guns, and plastic explosives
past the Secure 1000. However, we also ﬁnd that multiple
iterations of experimentation and adjustment are likely
necessary to achieve consistent success. The security of
the Secure 1000, then, rests strongly on the adversary’s
inability to acquire access to the device for testing. How-
ever, since we were able to purchase a Secure 1000, it
is reasonable to assume that determined attackers and
well-ﬁnanced terrorist groups can do so as well. We
emphasize that procedural changes — speciﬁcally, per-
forming side scans and supplementing the scanner with
a magnetometer — would defeat some, though not all, of
the demonstrated attacks.
4 Cyberphysical Attacks
The Secure 1000, like other AITs, is a complex cyber-
physical system. It ties together X-ray emitters, detectors,
and analog circuitry under the control of embedded com-
puter systems, and feeds the resulting image data to a
traditional desktop system in the user console. In this
section, we investigate computer security threats against
AITs. We demonstrate a series of novel software- and
hardware-based attacks that undermine the Secure 1000’s
efﬁcacy, safety features, and privacy protections.
4.1 User Console Malware
The ﬁrst threat we consider is malware infecting the user
console. On our version of the Secure 1000, the user con-
sole is an MS-DOS–based PC attached to the scanner unit
via a proprietary cable; TSA models apparently used Win-
dows and a dedicated Ethernet switch [47, 49]. Although
