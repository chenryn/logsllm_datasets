User: I want to build Python 2.7.1 additionally to the one the redhat server already has pre-installed.
What options do I need to modify/use so that Python can be built under i.e. /opt/Python27
I would appreciate any help!
Assistant: You also want to pass --enable-shared to configure since it is an additional installation of Python.
