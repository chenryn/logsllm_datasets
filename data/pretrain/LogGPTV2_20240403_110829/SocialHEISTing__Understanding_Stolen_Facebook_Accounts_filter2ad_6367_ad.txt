search terms were recorded in 87 accounts (entered via the
Facebook search bar). To understand what the criminals were
searching for, as an indication of their intent, we analyzed
the search logs present in DYI archives. Table 3 (left-hand
side) shows the most common words in the search logs. Those
words were extracted and counted using the following steps
(implemented in Python). First, we combined all search terms
into a single document. Next, we tokenized the document into
words and removed all English stop words (e.g., “the”) using
the nltk.tokenize package [10]. We then stemmed the remain-
ing words using the Porter Stemmer function in the nltk.stem
package [9]. Finally, we counted the resulting words; the top
ten words are presented in Table 3. The search terms include
religion-related words as a result of numerous searches for de-
bates on atheism and religion. Other interesting search terms
that showed up in search logs include “britney spears,” “mark
zuckerberg,” and “bin carding,” along with searches for ex-
plicit content. We found that the attackers did not limit their
search for speciﬁc terms to individual accounts—they also
searched other accounts.
To understand the “spread” of search terms, we counted
the number of accounts that recorded the top search terms.
Table 4 shows the number of accounts in whose logs the top
searched words appeared. Note that some words showed up
multiple times in an individual account and were counted

each time. For instance, if we ﬁnd the search terms “debates:
atheism” and “debates: atheism and religions” in the logs of
a particular account, we count “atheism” twice and “religion”
once. Note that searches fail to return the expected content
in Facebook test accounts since they are disconnected from
the regular Facebook graph. Table 4 indicates that searchers
proceed to try other accounts when their ﬁrst choice fails to
return search results.
4.8 Social Chatter
Recall that Table 1 shows that chatty accesses were responsi-
ble for 11% of all recorded actions. We observed chatty be-
havior in 45 accounts. These comprise attempted group calls,
“waves,” private messages, and posts on own timeline and
other timelines. We found some posts warning account owners
about leaked credentials (unknown to the posters, we leaked
honey credentials intentionally). We did not observe any post
containing phishing or malware-laden links; Facebook ac-
tively blocks such activity or retroactively hides previously-
posted malicious content. To observe the top words in the
chatty text corpus, we once again applied the word-counting
technique outlined in Section 4.7. The top ten chatty words
are shown in Table 3 (right-hand side).
Note the presence of the word “fake” in Table 3; some
comments stated that the accounts were fake (only within
4 accounts). This shows that a handful of criminals were
not fooled. Despite this, we still collected useful information
about them, at least, about their authentication actions and
subsequent activity. Note that we designed the accounts to
appear realistic. Hence, we succeeded in collecting activity
data anyway. Since we leaked credentials repeatedly on paste
sites (see Section 3.3), which do not have comment ﬁelds or
other direct feedback mechanisms, it is unlikely that those
who detected the fakeness of the accounts disclosed this to
other criminals, aside from the comments they posted in some
accounts (which we could delete if we wanted to).

4.9 System Conﬁguration of Accesses
Leveraging the user-agent string information available in DYI
archives, we extracted browser and operating system informa-
tion from the observed accesses. A wide range of browsers
and operating systems were used to access the honey ac-
counts. Table 5 shows a summary of those browsers. Chrome
and Firefox dominate the table of browsers, at 42% and 37%
respectively. A small fraction of accesses (less than 1%) were
apparently made using PhantomJS,3 a browser automation
tool. This suggests that some connections may have been
made automatically.
Table 6 shows an overview of the operating systems on
the devices that connected to honey accounts. Windows and
Android dominate the list (65% and 19% respectively). A
small fraction of accesses were also made with iPhones. Note
that these are merely indicators: user-agent strings can be
changed, and as such are not reliable.

4.10 Origin of Accesses
In total, we observed 415 IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6 ad-
dresses) from 53 countries. Of these IP addresses, 39 were
TOR exit nodes. It is possible that some of the remaining
IP addresses were proxies or VPN nodes. To understand the
geographical locations that accesses originated from, we ex-
tracted all IP addresses associated with accesses from the DYI
archives. We then carried out IP geolocation using IP-API [8],
an IP geolocation service that provides timezone and location
information, given one or more IP addresses. Figure 10 shows
a world map with markers showing the locations that accesses
originated from. As the map indicates, connections originated
from many locations around the world. Interesting patterns
include activity along the coasts of the Americas, a dense
cluster in Europe, and activity in India. No access originated
from China—note that Facebook is banned in China. It is
possible that criminals connected to some accounts via prox-
ies or VPNs. However, we did not observe any evidence that
conﬁrms or refutes this.
5 Discussion
In this section, we ﬁrst discuss the implications of our results,
in particular putting them in the context of previous research
on how age and gender affect cybercrime victimization. We
then discuss the limitations of our study and propose some
ideas for future work.
5.1 Characterizing Attacker Activity
According to our results, search activity, chatty activity, and
modiﬁcation of friend lists (adding or removing friends) con-
stitute the top three types of actions that were observed in
the accounts (apart from logging in). Given the social nature
of Facebook accounts, the manipulation of friend lists could
potentially be an approach to extend the reach of malicious
activity beyond the affected accounts. In other words, when
the attacker adds new contacts to an existing friend list, they
could eventually send phishing messages or scam messages
to new or existing contacts.
When criminals connected to our test Facebook accounts,
they mostly wrote private messages, public posts, and at-
tempted to search for information. Messages and posts were
exchanged across the accounts. We did not ﬁnd any bulk
spam or malware links in them. However, we observed the
occurence of racist and abusive content. This matches what
was reported by prior research on compromised accounts,
which found that sending spam and malicious messages in
general was not the main reason why miscreants breached
email accounts, but that instead the most common activity was
to search for sensitive information in those accounts [18, 42].
This makes even more sense for Facebook accounts, because
beyond messaging capabilities these accounts present many

other features. Hence, it is logical to expect a wider variety of
actions, as our ﬁndings reveal, than spamming. However, it
is important to note that some attackers may have intended
to send malicious content later in the conversations, had the
target account responded, as seen in fraud cases [31, 50, 58].
Hence, in future experiments, it may be helpful to incorpo-
rate chatbots in honey accounts to automatically respond to
messages sent by attackers.
Finally, the search terms that were recorded in the test ac-
counts (Section 4.7) reveal a wide variety of themes of interest
in the accounts. Modeling benign and malicious search activ-
ity (i.e., legitimate users versus criminals) could possibly help
to distinguish and mitigate malicious activity in compromised
accounts. We leave that to future work since we do not have
baseline search data for benign users, and would need such
baseline data to develop robust automated mitigation systems.
5.2 Demographic Factors
We show that demographic attributes of accounts (age range
and gender) inﬂuence the activity of criminals in compro-
mised accounts. In other words, we show a signiﬁcant rela-
tionship between account demographics and the actions that
criminals carry out in the accounts. Similarly, we show that
sequences of actions differ in the accounts per age range and
gender, with the exception of search activity sequences. This
indicates that the demographic attributes of accounts should
be taken into consideration when building tools to automati-
cally detect malicious activity in stolen social accounts. The
modeling of differences in action sequences across account
demographics led to interesting ﬁndings in itself, and could
potentially be extended into techniques to distinguish mali-
cious activity from benign activity (for instance, by a large
online service). However, caution must be exercised to avoid
user proﬁling while exploring this potential solution to mali-
cious activity.
In addition to the differences in activity sequences, we ob-
served other distinctions across account demographics in the
types of actions that attackers carried out. For instance, the
attackers of teen accounts were chattier than those of adult
accounts, while the attackers of adult accounts were more
interested in adding or removing friends than those of teen
accounts. We also observed differences in male and female
accounts, especially in proﬁle editing and friend list modiﬁca-
tion activity. Again, these show that account demographics
play an important role in determining the actions that crimi-
nals carry out in stolen social accounts. This knowledge could
potentially be helpful for large online services seeking to
improve their detection systems.
Next, we put our results in the context of prior research
literature. Although our work is the ﬁrst one studying criminal
activity in compromised Facebook accounts, it is helpful to
understand how our results compare to previous research
in cybercrime and online abuse victimization. Note that a
signiﬁcant amount of work was conducted in understanding
demographics factors that inﬂuence people’s likelihood of
falling for phishing [41, 45], malware [17, 37], or fraud [60].
In our work, we are interested in understanding what attackers
do once they compromise a Facebook account, and therefore
instead look at research that studied the type of malicious
activity that different demographics are likely to experience
online.
Age. The teen accounts in our dataset recorded more proﬁle
editing and chatty behavior than adult accounts. This is in
line with previous work showing that younger people are
more likely to receive online abuse and harassment [51], as
well as previous work showing that younger people have a
higher chance of being victimized by cybercrime [40]. In
4128    30th USENIX Security Symposium

our dataset, the adult accounts suffered much more from the
addition or removal of friends than teen accounts. A possible
explanation for this is that previous research reported that
older people are disproportionately affected by online fraud,
for example romance scams [30,50,58]. It is possible that the
attackers were trying to reach potential victims by making
friends requests. Unfortunately, since our IRB protocol did not
allow us to interact with criminals, we could not reply to any
conversation and understand the purpose of the connection.
Gender. In our dataset, female accounts received more friend
requests than male accounts (126 vs 31). A potential reason is
that multiple studies reported that women are more likely to
receive online abuse like sexual harassment [22, 36, 51]. It is
possible that these malicious actions had the goal of harassing
the victim, whether sexually or otherwise. Another possible
explanation lies in the fact that previous research observed
that fraudsters engaging in romance scams were often posing
as older men and targeting women [30, 50, 58]. It is possible
that cybercriminals were aiming to contact women’s accounts
to potentially defraud them. Since our IRB protocol did not
allow us to interact with criminals, we could not reply to the
messages received by our accounts to better understand the
intentions of the attacker.
In our dataset, male accounts encountered more search ac-
tivity than female accounts. Previous research showed that
cybercriminals often search stolen accounts for sensitive in-
formation that might enable them to mount additional attacks
(e.g., ﬁnancial information) [18, 42]. If this was the intention
of cybercriminals, the predilection for male accounts can be
explained by previous work that showed that men are more
