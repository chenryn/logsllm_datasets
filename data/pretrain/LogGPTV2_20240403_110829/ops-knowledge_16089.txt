User: I have a docker container that is running a command. In the Dockerfile the last line is CMD ["python", "myprogram.py"] . This runs a flask server. 
There are scenarios when I update myprogram.py and need to kill the command, transfer the updated myprogram.py file to the container, and execute python myprogram.py again. I imagine this to be a common scenario. 
However, I haven't found a way to do this. Since this is the only command in the Dockerfile...I can't seem to kill it. from the containers terminal when I run ps -aux I can see that python myprogram.py is assigned a PID of 1. But when I try to kill it with kill -9 1 it doesn't seem to work. 
Is there a workaround to accomplish this? My goal is to be able to change myprogram.py on my host machine, transfer the updated myprogram.py into the container, and execute python myprogram.py again.

Not really.  The common scenario is either:

Kill existing container
Build new image via your Dockerfile
Boot container from new image

Or:

Start container with a volume mount pointing at your source
Restart the container when you update your code

Either one works.  The second is useful for development, since it has a slightly quicker turnaround.
