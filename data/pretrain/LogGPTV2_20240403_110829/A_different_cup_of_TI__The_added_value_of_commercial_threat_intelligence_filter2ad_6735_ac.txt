### Uneven Distribution of Indicators Over Time and Across Reports

Indicators are unevenly distributed over time. For instance, a sudden increase in the volume of indicators can be attributed to a vendor introducing new report types, leading to the simultaneous publication of many corresponding indicators. Additionally, indicators are very unevenly distributed across the reports in which they are published.

### Coverage of Threats

Coverage refers to the extent to which a threat intelligence (TI) source includes indicators for all the threats it aims to capture. In the absence of a comprehensive ground truth for ongoing threats, we evaluate coverage by examining the overlap between two vendors, similar to the approach used by Li et al. [21]. Less overlap suggests that each vendor is observing unique indicators that the other misses, indicating potential limitations in the coverage of threats.

### Analysis of Overlap

We analyzed the overlap for the same 22 actors that both vendors claim to track. The results, summarized in Figure 3, show very low overlap—on average between 2.5% to 4.0%, depending on the indicator type. This overlap is unevenly distributed and concentrated on a few actors. The highest overlap is 21.0% for the IP addresses of threat actor 21. Given that these indicators are supposed to cover the activity of the same threat actors, this overlap is surprisingly low, raising questions about the actual coverage of malicious activity.

### Utility of PTI Reports

In our interviews, respondents highlighted that PTI provider reports are valuable at all levels of the organization, from Security Operations Center (SOC) analysts to Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs). A manager at a Managed Service Provider (MSP) described reports as the most important form of PTI, as they provide context for alerts and help in explaining false positives to clients. For example, if a critical alert occurs, the analyst needs to inform the client, often at inconvenient times, and explain why the security appliance flagged the event. This helps in deciding whether to filter out the event or continue monitoring it.

### Requests for Information (RFIs)

RFIs are inquiries from customers to the vendor’s analysts. Eight of our respondents emphasized the importance of RFIs. An RFI might involve an analyst inquiring about the relevance of a threat to their organization, such as asking if campaigns in a specific sector or geographic area have been observed. Vendors typically search their data and provide a response. Our respondents noted that RFIs are budgeted as part of the contract, with around 10 inquiries per year. One respondent mentioned that vendors are often willing to share information even without a formal RFI, and another described having a dedicated analyst at the vendor for 0.5 Full-Time Equivalent (FTE), who becomes familiar with their information needs over time.

### Portals and Data Mining Platforms

Portals provide access to historical data on threat actors and their campaigns, including overviews of reports by target sectors and other relevant data. Respondents indicated that portals contain most of the information a vendor has, sometimes more than what can be requested via APIs. Data mining platforms and aggregators offer OTI as-a-service, allowing customers to run queries and integrate their own PTI data sources. These platforms are subscription-based and may include open-source security data. While some debate exists over categorizing these tools as "intelligence products," our respondents considered them part of their paid TI.

### Industry Focus of PTI Reports

Figure 4 shows that government and financial services are the primary industries reported on by two leading PTI providers from 2013-2018. Surprisingly, civil society, including NGOs and international organizations, is the third most targeted sector, despite potentially lacking the resources to use high-end TI. We mapped vendor labels to a common structure to facilitate this analysis.

### Pricing of PTI

Public information on PTI pricing is limited. No PTI provider transparently provides pricing information on their website. A recent Gartner report lists market leaders' services at upwards of USD 100,000 [20]. We collected 38 price points for 6 popular PTI providers and 2 smaller providers, displayed in Figure 5. The data points were derived from publicly available price lists and vendor quotes. High-end vendors sell their own TI for $100,000-$650,000 per year, while paid aggregators, offering platforms to integrate TI from other sources, charge $30,000-$100,000 per year. Pricing models can be based on per-user licensing, and costs can be negotiated. A TI analyst at a major bank stated, "Vendor pricing is arbitrary and based on the size of the customer organization."

### Comparison with Open TI

We address the differences between paid and open TI. Open TI sources are freely available but diverse, ranging from news articles to message board threads. Paid TI reports are more complete in describing context, implications, and mitigation options. A manager at an R&D institute in Japan noted that paid TI is particularly useful for larger organizations needing detailed attack information, while OSINT may suffice for medium-sized companies.

### Indicator Overlap and Timeliness

Respondents collect indicators from various sources, labeling them in TI platforms or SIEM systems. PTI indicators are perceived as more accurate due to curation and smaller feed sizes, reducing false positives. However, the rate of false negatives may be higher. The overlap between paid and open sources is negligible, as shown in Figure 6. Figure 7 illustrates the fraction of total volume shared among sources. PTI vendors share some indicators, but the overlap is low. OTI sources share more indicators among themselves but have almost no overlap with PTI.

Timeliness is crucial for effective defense. Pairwise comparisons of PTI and OTI sources show significant delays, with PTI vendors taking over a month to observe indicators first seen by another vendor. This delay suggests that vendors do not effectively use competitors' TI to find the same indicators in their telemetry. The same appears true for STI, with a team lead at an oil and gas company noting that they often receive information earlier through their own networks than from paid providers.

### Uses and Value of TI

Customer organizations pay substantial amounts for PTI, expecting value in detection, context, and decision-making. PTI reports and RFIs provide critical context, while portals and data mining platforms offer comprehensive data. Despite the high cost, the perceived accuracy and timeliness of PTI make it a valuable tool for large enterprises, though the actual coverage and overlap with open sources remain areas of concern.
