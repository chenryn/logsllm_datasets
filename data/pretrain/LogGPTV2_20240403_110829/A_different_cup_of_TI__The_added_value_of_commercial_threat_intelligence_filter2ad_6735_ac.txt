unevenly distributed over time. For example, two hikes of the
indicator volume can be explained by a vendor’s introduction
of new report types, leading them to to publish many of the
corresponding indicators at once. Indicators are also very
unevenly distributed over the reports they are published with.
Coverage is the extent to which a TI source actually in-
cludes indicators for all the threats that the source intends
to capture. In the absence of ground truth on all ongoing
threats, we look at the overlap among the two vendors – a
similar approach to Li et al. [21]. Less overlap means that
each vendor is observing unique indicators that are missed by
the other providers, suggesting limitations in the coverage of
threats.
We analysed the overlap for the same 22 actors that both

providers are helpful on “all decks of the organisation”, from
SOC analyst to CISO. A manager at an MSP described re-
ports as the most important form of PTI, as they allowed
his analysts to provide context for the clients of why certain
alerts happened and what they mean: “We need to inform the
customer if we get a critical alert. It may be 2 AM and we call
the customer’s mobile phone, only to ﬁnd out that it’s a false
positive – that happens very often. Then we need to explain
why this [security appliance] product says this, so we need
some kind of reasoning. Then the customer asks us to ﬁlter
out the event, or keep monitoring it.”
(cid:4) Requests for information (RFIs) are inquiries from
customers to the vendor’s analysts. These were described
by eight of our respondents as an important form of PTI. A
request might work as follows. From reading a threat report,
an analyst could be wondering about the relevance of the
described threat for their organization. They might inquire
with the report’s authors if campaigns in some speciﬁc sector
or geographic area had been observed. The vendor would
then search their own data and report back with information.
Our respondents described that requests for information are
budgeted as part of the contract at around 10 inquiries per year.
One respondent explained that, in practice, the PTI providers
were willing to share information if they could, even without
a formal RFI. The quota for inquiries were mostly a formality.
Another respondent described that as part of their contract,
they had been assigned an analyst at the vendor for 0.5 FTE.
They would be always in touch with the same person, who
over time came to understand their information needs.
(cid:4) Portals provide access to information that a PTI ven-
dor has delivered over time. They consist of websites with
historic data on threat actors and their campaigns, overviews
of reports by target sector, as well as other data that the ven-
dor may provide, such as indicators or malware samples. Our
respondents describe that portals contain most of the informa-
tion a vendor has, sometimes more than what can be requested
from the API.
(cid:4) Data mining platforms and aggregators are effec-
tively OTI as-a-service. These are subscription-based plat-
forms on which customers can run queries, sometimes coming
pre-loaded with open source security data. Some TI aggrega-
tors focus on the analysis tool (TI platform) as a product, and
have a curated OTI feed as an additional service. Customers
can plug in their own PTI data sources in these platforms.
The categorization of such trade tools as ‘intelligence prod-
ucts’ is up for debate, but our respondents did indeed name
them as part of their paid threat intelligence.
Figure 4: Government and ﬁnancials represent the main in-
dustries as reported on by two leading paid TI providers from
2013-2018. Civil society is the third most targeted sector
observed, which is surprising if we assume that these organi-
zation are not really in a position to pay for and use high-end
TI. We mapped vendor labels to a common structure.
vendors claim to track. The results are summarized in Fig-
ure 3. We ﬁnd very low overlap – on average between 2.5
to 4.0%, depending on the indicator type. The overlap is
unevenly distributed and mostly concentrated on a handful
of actors. The highest overlap is 21.0% for the IP addresses
of threat actor 21. This overlap is low, considering that these
indicators are supposed to provide coverage of the activity of
the same threat actors. These results beg the question what
coverage these indicators actually provide of all malicious
activity, by these actors and otherwise. We extend the analysis
of overlap in Section 6 with OTI.
(cid:4) Reports come in various ﬂavors. Malware reports de-
scribe the technical results of reverse-engineering captured bi-
naries. Threat reports describe the goals and modus operandi
of threat actors. Advisories and alerts describe current events,
such as a software vulnerability being targeted or a threat
group expanding their focus to another geographic region.
As can be seen in Figure 4, paid TI reports primarily con-
sider threats to government, military, and ﬁnancial services.
These sectors likely form an important part of the customer
base of PTI providers. A surprising third in subject matter
was civil society, including NGOs and international organi-
zations. Possibly this prominence could be explained by the
political signiﬁcance of the targeting of civil society, or by the
relatively large number of such campaigns being observed.
(cid:4) Custom alerts notify customers of speciﬁc risks to their
organizations. An example is when a domain is registered
that is similar to the customer domain, which could be used
for typosquatting. Another example is when compromised
credentials of the customer organization occur in credential

We note that the two leading providers that we have
analyzed do not offer this service. Providers that offer it may
be targeting a different audience with their services, possibly
customers that are in need of a managed TI capability, rather
than external data sources as input to their existing TI team.
5.2 Pricing of PTI
Public information on pricing of paid threat intelligence in-
formation is sparse. We did not identify a single instance of
a PTI provider transparently providing pricing information
on its website. In general, a recent Gartner report lists the ser-
vices of the market leaders as upwards of USD 100,000 [20].
We collected 38 price points for 6 popular PTI providers
[14] as well as 2 smaller providers. These are displayed in
Figure 5. The data points were derived from publicly available
schedule price lists [11, 8], as well as by requesting quotes
from these vendors. Note that services offered by vendors are
not directly comparable and that therefore this ﬁgure gives
only a rough indication of pricing in the market as a whole.
On the right side ($100,000-$650,000 per year), we ﬁnd
high-end vendors which sell their own TI, while on the left
($30,000-$100,000 per year) we ﬁnd paid aggregators, whose
services primarily consist of providing a platform to integrate
TI from other sources and to support analysts with analytics.
The wide bandwidth may be explained by pricing models
and negotiations. Our respondents describe that pricing mod-
els are sometimes based on per-user licensing, where costs
increase as the number of analysts that have access to the
provider’s portal grows. Furthermore, pricing can be negoti-
ated. A TI analyst at a major bank, said: “Vendor pricing is
arbitrary. It’s based on the size of the customer organization
in most cases.” Another respondent described a negotiation
with a TI provider in which the asking price was lowered by
a factor ten.
Although there is leeway and room for negotiation, PTI
currently seems restricted to enterprise organizations with
large budgets for information security. A Team Lead TI at
a bank shared: “The global costs of a CTI team is around
C1-1.5 million per year, including 6-7 staff members and
tooling costs. [...] Purchasing two or three feeds at C115,000
to C135,000 per year each may sound like a lot, but is actually
not so bad for a bank.”
6 COMPARISON WITH OPEN TI
We now address the second question: How is paid TI differ-
ent from open TI? We deﬁne sources of OTI by the simple
fact that they are freely available, but they are very diverse
in nature. A news article may be seen as open source intelli-
gence, as may a thread on a message board on which criminal
activity is discussed. According to one analyst we spoke to,
open TI included the cybersecurity podcast he listened to on
his commute to work.
Figure 5: Subscription costs of various PTI providers. Pric-
ing is often based on the size of the customer organization,
with major vendors demanding upwards of $100,000 per year.
We then compare indicators from two paid providers and
four prominent open source feeds, and establish that there is
almost no overlap between the two types of sources.
6.1 Reports
Security researchers, also those at PTI vendors, post blogs,
write-ups, and tweets that are accessible to everyone. These
are basically the OTI analogue to the reports from PTI ven-
dors. In fact, most vendors make a small fraction of their
reports publicly available for marketing, moving them into
the OTI domain.1 These are the same reports as their cus-
tomers receive, but without the associated indicator sets.
Open and paid sources are by no means decoupled in terms
of the attackers they describe. Vendor reports often refer to
work posted by OTI researchers, in some cases copying in
screenshots of tweets that ﬁrst observed certain attacker be-
haviour. We ﬁnd that paid providers often draw on such open
sources, but their reports are much more complete in their
description of the context, implications, and possible mitiga-
tion options. A manager at an R&D institute in Japan had the
view that this property makes paid TI useful especially for
larger organizations: “[Paid] threat intelligence is useful for
organizations wanting to know much more details about an
attack, but using OSINT should be enough for the purposes
of a SOC in a medium-sized company.”
Indicators
6.2
Respondents collect indicators from open, shared, and paid
sources, often loading these in their TI platform or SIEM
system. In these systems, indicators are labeled with their
origin, allowing analysts to interpret them, e.g. based on their
source. Three respondents stated that they did not distinguish
between paid and open sources in their detection processes –
indicators are indicators.

ferred to as blacklists or abuse feeds. Respondents discussed
the conﬁdence they place in TI sources.
In this context,
PTI was thought to be more ‘accurate’ than those from OTI.
When pressed, it seems that respondents actually meant: more
curated and smaller feeds, rather than more accurate. Smaller
sets produce, by deﬁnition, fewer false positives. Respon-
dents were emphasizing the element of accuracy that impacts
the analyst’s workﬂow, namely minimizing the number of
false positives. The other side of accuracy, the rate of false
negatives, was not mentioned, even though this rate might ac-
tually be higher for smaller and more curated feeds. Because
of this perceived accuracy, PTI indicators are used with more
conﬁdence in detection and other use cases.
(cid:4) Overlap among paid and open sources is negligible,
even though the OTI lists are vastly more voluminous than
the lists of PTI indicators, as can be seen in Figure 6. This is
relevant, because overlap helps us understand the coverage of
a source – the level to which it captures the intended threats –
as described in Section 5. The overlap between the individual
sources is shown in Figure 7 as a fraction of the total volume
of that source for that period. Vendor 1 and vendor 2 (PTI)
share some indicators amongst each other – 1,3% and 13,0%
respectively. This seems low, considering that the feeds are
focused on the same topic areas in the overall landscape. It
appears that PTI has the same pattern as OTI: a lack of
overlap among feeds and the dominance of ‘singletons’. Less
than 1% of the PTI indicators overlap with any of the OTI
sources. Vice versa, the OTI sources share indicators with
each other, quite substantially in some cases, but there is
basically no overlap with PTI: 0,0% of all OTI indicators
are also observed in the PTI sources. As we describe in
the Methodology, the uncommonly large amount of overlap
between the OTI sources [21] is explained by the fact that
we selected speciﬁcally for OTI that is often re-used [15] in
hopes that this would increase overlap with PTI sources – to
no such effect.
(cid:4) Timeliness of indicators means that the information is
available to the customer early enough to actually detect and
stop an attempt at compromise. While there is no ground truth
as to when a particular resource (domain, IP, binary) was ﬁrst
used by a threat actor, we can assess timeliness via pairwise
comparisons of the different feeds and measuring the delays
in which indicators are made available to customers. For this
analysis, we work with the small number of indicators that
occur in more than one set.
We ﬁrst compare the two PTI vendors (n=16 and n=28,
respectively). In Figure 8, we can see drastic delays in when
PTI vendors observe indicators. On average, it take more
than a month before an indicator observed by one vendor
is also observed by the other vendor. In terms of defend-
ing against sophisticated threat actors, this is a very long
delay. We ﬁnd almost no instances where threat intelligence
is distributed by other PTI within the same week. It seems
Figure 6: Overlap between OTI indicators published in one
month (October 2018) and PTI indicator sets published in
the enclosing ﬁve months (Aug-Dec). The latter time frame
allows for variations in timing when the indicators are ﬁrst
reported and thus provides us with an upper-bound estimate
of overlap. The overlap turns out to be negligible, suggesting
that these types of intelligence are different in kind, as well
as in volume. Areas in the diagram are proportional to the
number of indicators.
that vendors do not use the TI from their competitors, or at
least not successfully, to ﬁnd the same indicators in their own
telemetry.
We conducted the same analysis for the indicators of the
two vendors versus the four OTI sources. The latter compari-
son is only based on the tiny overlap of 2 to 7 cases, which
means that we cannot draw any strong conclusions. One
might expect that paid providers would be faster in all cases,
but PTI sources were faster in only half of the cases we have
analysed. So it seems PTI is not faster in ﬁnding indicators
than OTI. The same appears to hold vis-à-vis STI, in the
words of a team lead TI at an oil and gas company: “We also
have our own networks with companies in [our sector] and I
must honestly say, we quite often get the information earlier
there than from our [paid] intelligence providers.”
While we have no ground truth as to when a particular
resource (domain, IP, binary) was ﬁrst used by an actor, the
fact that we see major delays in all pairwise comparisons
of our PTI and OTI sources suggests timeliness is a major
problem.
7 USES AND VALUE OF TI
This section addresses our ﬁnal question: How do customers
use TI and how do they perceive its value? Given that cus-
tomer organizations of PTI are paying a substantial amount
