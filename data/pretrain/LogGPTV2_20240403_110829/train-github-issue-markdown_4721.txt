I attempted to run the example in the `neural_style_transfer.py` file and aimed to visualize the output features of the ReLU units for a single image within the VGG network. To avoid modifying the code, I duplicated the same image three times and input them together into the network, using `K.function` to extract the outputs. However, the resulting output contained negative numbers.

Interestingly, when I extracted the output for only one image (while still providing three images as inputs, but using three separate `K.function()` calls to obtain their individual outputs), the issue with negative values disappeared. Additionally, even for the positive values, the combined outputs were different from the individual outputs.

This discrepancy is concerning, as it may indicate a more serious problem. Below are the relevant code segments, which I have not modified otherwise.
