I tried the example in the file "neural_style_transfer.py". I want to see the
outputs features of relu units for a single image in VGG network. I do not
want to trouble to modify the code so I simply duplicated the same image for
three times and inputs them together to the net (using K.function to extract
three outputs). But the output has negative numbers.
However, when I tried to extract the output of only one image (still kept
three image as inputs, but using three K.fucntion() to extract their outputs
seperately) the problem is gone.
Even for the positive values, joint outputs are still different from
individual outputs.
This is weird, I worry if it may cause serious problem. See below for the code
segments (I do not modify other codes)
