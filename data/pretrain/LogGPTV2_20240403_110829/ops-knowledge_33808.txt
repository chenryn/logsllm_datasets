Certainly! Here is a more structured and professional version of the log entry:

```
Log Entry:
- Timestamp: 2015-10-18 18:01:50.509
- Severity: INFO
- Process: main
- Component: org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.v2.app.MRAppMaster
- Message: The OutputCommitter is set to org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.lib.output.FileOutputCommitter
- Epoch Time: 1445162510
```

This format clearly separates the different components of the log, making it easier to read and understand.
