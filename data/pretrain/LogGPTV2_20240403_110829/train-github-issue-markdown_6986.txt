Hi
When I open a git-controlled folder, and possibly change some settings, then
Code creates a .vscode directory directly inside that folder, and stores files
such as settings.json or launch.json in it.
That folder either has to be checked in or .ignored, which is OK on repos I
control, but not OK on forked repos I want to contribute to for instance,
which needs to stay clean.
Can't this data be stored in some Code own data folder?
Cheers
