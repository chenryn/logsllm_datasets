As of 3.1 M2, the `@PropertySource` annotation allows for declarative
registration of property sources against the enclosing `Environment`. However,
it does not allow for manipulation of property source ordering. This (if
desired at all) must be done against the
`ConfigurableEnvironment#getPropertySources()` `MutablePropertySources` API.
This issue exists to gauge interest in this feature (read: collect votes).
Please be specific about use cases in order to assess whether such an
enhancement truly represents a general need.
If interest is sufficient, we'll consider this for 3.1 RC1.
