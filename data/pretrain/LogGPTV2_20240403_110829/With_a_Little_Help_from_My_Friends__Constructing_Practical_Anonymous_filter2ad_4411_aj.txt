We can now follow the proof for FHS15 and in particular Claim 1
and Corollary 1 (which is exactly as in their proof), and by using

for (1a) we need to have 𝜋𝑦 = 𝜋 ˆ𝑦 and the non-zero coefficients are
𝜓𝑦,𝑗 and 𝜓 ˆ𝑦,𝑗, where we have 𝜓𝑦,𝑗 = 𝜓 ˆ𝑦,𝑗 for all 𝑖 ∈ [𝑞]. Conse-
quently, the proof continues exactly as the FHS15 with the only
difference that we additionally need to investigate (2c). By leverag-
ing the simplification of Eq. (9) in [45], we know that there exists
one 𝑛 ∈ [𝑞] for which 𝑦∗ = 𝜓𝑦,𝑛
. By construction we have
ℎ∗ = ℎ𝑖 for a given 𝑖 ∈ [𝑘], i.e., the tag 𝜏𝑖 of the forgery. Now only
considering non-zero coefficients we can simplify (1b) to

From FHS15 we know that 𝜌𝑧,𝑗 𝜋𝑦𝑧𝑛 = 0 for all 𝑗 ∈ [𝑞]. But since 𝑧 𝑗
and 𝜌𝑧,𝑗 are non-zero for some 𝑗, we have 𝜋𝑦 = 0 and thus 𝜃 ˆ𝑣,𝑖 = 0
for all 𝑖 ∈ [𝑘]. By equating coefficients we have
𝑦∗ℎ𝑖 = 𝜓𝑦,𝑛

By leveraging the fact that all 𝑦𝑖 are distinct, we obtain that ˆ𝑣∗ =

𝜈 ˆ𝑣,𝑛(ℎ𝑖
with the remainder representing a previous query with the exact
same tag and in particular the entire forgery is just a multiple of
previously queried message. Note that the simulation error is the
same as in the FHS15 proof.

VKey(sk, pk) = 1 (which checks if pk = 𝑔sk

B.4 Proof of Lemma 3.12
We use the same notation as in the proof of Lemma 3.6 and note that
we consider a bounded attribute-space represented by distinct and
random elements ℎ𝑖 ∈ G∗
2, 𝑖 ∈ [𝑘], in the mpk (i.e., one for every
possible (Attr, 𝑣Attr) pair). Moreover, for the sake of readability we
prove the lemma for the case 𝑡 = 2 with public keys pk1 = (𝑔𝑥𝑖2 )𝑖∈[ℓ]
and pk2 = (𝑔𝑢𝑖2 )𝑖∈[ℓ] respectively and it is straightforward to gener-
alize it to any 𝑛 > 2. Note that a query for the same representative
𝑀 to either of the keys results in using the same randomness 𝑦. We
require that for any message 𝑀 to the Sign oracle of AAEQ, if the
adversary wants to obtain a signature for more than one attribute,
it will obtain signatures under both secret keys (attributes) using
the same randomness 𝑦 (which is sampled uniformly at random in
Session 6D: Authentication and Privacy CCS ’21, November 15–19, 2021, Virtual Event, Republic of Korea2021each query to Sign) and the queried attribute values 𝑣Attr and 𝑣Attr′
(which maps to two of the ℎ values). We will denote the correspond-
ing 𝑍1 elements of signatures under pk1 and pk2 using superscript
(1) and (2) respectively.
As in the proof of Lemma 3.6, we follow the the proof of the
underlying FHS15 SPS-EQ scheme in [45]. We start by taking the
discrete logarithms of all elements:

with the pair of (Attr, 𝑣Attr) values in the forgery w.l.o.g. correspond-
ing to ℎ1 and ℎ2 respectively. In the following we omit the analysis
of Equation (3c) as this follows from the exact same reasoning as in
the proof of Lemma 3.6. First, we observe that we can adopt Claim 1
and Corollary 1 from the FHS15 proof in [45] to our case of the 𝑧(1)
𝑛
and 𝑧(2)
𝑛 which in particular means that all 𝑦’s in such monomials
are different, one is 𝑦𝑛 and for every 𝑥 as well as 𝑢 there comes one
𝑦. Moreover, 𝑧(1)
contains one more 𝑥 than 𝑢’s and vice-versa for
𝑧(2)
𝑛 . Now, we first look at Equation (3b) and comparing coefficients
immediately yields that 𝜋𝑦∗ = 𝜋 ˆ𝑦∗, that 𝜒 ˆ𝑦,𝑖 = 𝜔 ˆ𝑦,𝑖 = 0 for all
𝑖 ∈ [ℓ], 𝜃 ˆ𝑦,𝑖 = 𝜈 ˆ𝑣,𝑗 = 0 for all 𝑖 ∈ [𝑘] and 𝜓𝑦,𝑗 = 𝜓 ˆ𝑦,𝑗 for all 𝑗 ∈ [𝑞].
Moreover, due to Claim 1 we have that 𝜌(1)
𝑦,𝑗 = 0 for all
𝑗 ∈ [𝑞]. This simplifies Equation (3b) to
𝑦,𝑗 = 𝜌(2)
