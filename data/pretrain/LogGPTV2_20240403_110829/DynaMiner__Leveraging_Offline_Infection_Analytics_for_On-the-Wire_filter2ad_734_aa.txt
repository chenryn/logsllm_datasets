**Abstract:**

Web-borne malware remains a significant threat in the digital landscape. Central to these infections are cybercriminal toolkits that exploit vulnerabilities in web browsers and their extensions. When a victim's system is compromised, the infection dynamics often blend with benign traffic, making it challenging to detect malicious activity.

In this paper, we introduce DynaMiner, a system that leverages web conversation graph (WCG) analytics to analyze the interactions between a victim and malicious hosts without the need to examine exploit payloads. By deriving insights from WCG analytics, we formulate the malware detection problem as a graph-based learning task. Our approach abstracts and comprehensively analyzes the pre-, during-, and post-infection dynamics, providing a payload-agnostic method for detecting malware. DynaMiner utilizes three years of infection data from nine popular exploit kits.

Our implementation, DynaMiner, was evaluated on both infection and benign HTTP traffic. It achieved a 97.3% true positive rate with a false positive rate of 1.5%. Case studies indicate that DynaMiner can detect unknown malware up to 11 days earlier than existing antivirus engines.

**Keywords:** malware detection, graph analytics, machine learning.

**I. Introduction**

Drive-by-download malware infections have become a common occurrence on the web. As cybercriminals employ increasingly sophisticated evasion techniques, the research community has responded with behavioral analysis methods for malware detection. Prior work has focused on various aspects of malware, including binary reputation, exploit behavior, redirection graphs, malware download paths, and botnet command and control (C&C) communication.

While these approaches are effective in isolation, real-world malware infections involve a complex sequence of interactions among multiple actors, such as compromised websites, traffic distribution services (TDSs), landing page servers, and exploit servers. These interactions can be categorized into pre-download, payload download, and post-download phases. We argue that a comprehensive malware detection scheme should leverage the relationships between these actors to better understand and defend against malware.

DynaMiner is a novel system that uses payload-agnostic WCG analytics to detect malware. It captures the rich dynamics of interactions between a victim and malicious hosts, enabling the system to infer malicious behavior without analyzing the exploit payload. DynaMiner abstracts HTTP transactions into a WCG, which captures the relationships and temporal dynamics of the interactions. The system then performs graph analytics to infer payload-agnostic properties and determine whether the traffic is malicious or benign. DynaMiner relies on 37 payload-agnostic features, 27 of which are novel, and 15 of these are among the top-20 most distinguishing features for infection detection.

To address the challenge of noisy benign traffic, DynaMiner uses an Ensemble Random Forest (ERF) classifier, which is robust in the presence of noise. This classifier can capture distinct patterns in the WCGs, including redirection, download, and post-download sub-structures. Additionally, the system filters out obvious sources of noise, such as downloads from trusted software vendors.

Evaluations on a dataset spanning three years of infection intelligence show that DynaMiner achieves 97.3% accuracy with a 1.5% false positive rate. In a validation dataset, our classifier outperformed VirusTotal by 11.5%. Forensic and live case studies further demonstrate the practical viability of DynaMiner, with one instance where it detected an unknown malware 11 days before VirusTotal.

**Contributions:**
- An empirical analysis providing novel insights into payload-agnostic malware detection.
- A payload-agnostic malware infection analysis technique based on WCG analytics.
- A system deployable at the network level for real-time malware detection.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section II provides background on infection dynamics, Section III introduces our approach, Section IV discusses payload-agnostic features, Section V covers training and detection, Section VI presents evaluation results, and Sections VII and VIII discuss limitations and related work, respectively. Section IX concludes the paper.

**II. Background: Infection Dynamics Study**

To motivate our approach, we present insights from our analysis of real malware infection episodes captured over three years on an enterprise network.

**A. Analysis Context and Sanitization**

We used deep packet inspection to extract artifacts from HTTP transactions related to malware infections. To focus on actual infections, we excluded non-malicious HTTP transactions and associated payloads using heuristics. All malicious payloads were verified using VirusTotal.

**B. Challenges in Connecting the Dots**

Reconstructing the infection scenario from HTTP traffic is not straightforward. Pre-download dynamics, such as redirections, require careful analysis of Referrer and Location headers, as well as deciphering obfuscated client-side code. Post-infection dynamics, such as C&C callbacks, also need to be inferred.

**C. Ground Truth Data and Collection Methodology**

Table I summarizes our ground truth dataset, which includes 770 PCAP traces of exploit kit malware infections and 980 PCAP traces of benign web surfing. The dataset spans three years and covers nine popular exploit kits and six predominant exploit payloads. Benign traces were collected from various browsing scenarios, including search, social media, email, and video streaming, ensuring a realistic representation of web traffic.

Next, we highlight empirical insights on malware infection, focusing on exposure, graph properties, and HTTP header properties.

**D. Insights on Exposure**

Malware infections often begin with unsuspecting victims being lured to seemingly harmless sites through various exposures, such as links in emails, search results, and shared URLs. Understanding these exposure methods is crucial for developing effective detection strategies.
