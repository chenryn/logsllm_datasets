User: For Python 3.2, What is recommended: easy_install-3.2 or easy_install?
Why two execs? What's the difference? 
One more question: distribute or setuptools? setuptools is obviously not working on 
Intel Win64/python3.2 (or not available as of writing this post).
Assistant: You use the easy_install that is for the installation of Python where you want to install it. In most cases, both easy_install and easy_install-3.2 will be the same program and install to the same installation of Python.
You can install the same version of Python in different places, then you need to run the easy_install from the right place. You can also install several versions of Python in one place, and then you need to use the right version.
Always use Distribute in preference to Setuptools.
