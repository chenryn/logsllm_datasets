Subject: Update Dependency to Address Security Vulnerability

Hi,

Could you please update the `minimist` package to version 1.2.3 or higher? This update is necessary to address a moderate Prototype Pollution vulnerability, as detailed in the advisory [here](https://npmjs.com/advisories/1179).

The affected dependencies are:

1. **webpack-dev-server (dev dependency)**
   - Path: `webpack-dev-server > chokidar > fsevents > node-pre-gyp > tar > mkdirp > minimist`
   
2. **webpack (dev dependency)**
   - Path: `webpack > watchpack > chokidar > fsevents > node-pre-gyp > rc > minimist`

Updating these dependencies will help ensure our project remains secure and free from known vulnerabilities.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Best regards,  
[Your Name]
