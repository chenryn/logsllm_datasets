Enormous unpredictable ways of virus behaviors once they have 
been executed.
○ 既需要应对文件变化，又需要应对行为变化
 It has to deal with either changes of files or changes in behaviors
○ 随着各种安全策略的增加，不断拖耗系统性能
 With the increasing numbers of security strategies, the efficiency 
of system decreases.
○ 兼容性不好 Low in compatibility
○ 驱动级更新对抗，稍有不慎便蓝屏崩溃

金山云防御-为什么要边界防御(2)
Why is boundary defense needed? 
● 边界防御的优势 The advantages of boundary defense
○ 只做文件对抗 
 Only the file scanning is needed.
○ 只有极少情况会触发边界防御逻辑
 Only few circumstances will trigger the logics of boundary 
defense
○ 轻量级高兼容性实现
 Lightweight and high compatibility
○ 不用根据病毒的行为变化不停改变
 Doesn’t need to alter with different kinds of virus 
 behaviors
金山云防御-为什么要边界防御(3)
Why is boundary defense needed? 
● 边界防御可行么 Does boundary defense really work?
● 每日边界防御的新增文件数量是有限的（可运营）
 The increasing numbers of files of everyday boundary defense 
is limited. (Sustainable)
● 边界防御中遇到的威胁是容易定性的（可做解决方案）
 The threats boundary defense system would encounter are 
easily identifiable. (Can be solved by specialized 
 solution package)

● 最本质的区别 The essential distinction
○ 边界防御是一个整体的解决方案以保证恶意文件不进
入系统。
 Boundary defense is a comprehensive solution 
to prevent malware from entering systems.
○ 下载保护只是一个具体的产品功能
 On-download file scanning is merely a specific 
product function.
