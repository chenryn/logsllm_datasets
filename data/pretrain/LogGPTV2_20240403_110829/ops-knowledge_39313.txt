M2Crypto provides support for ECDSA and ECDH, which require Elliptic Curve (EC) functionality. I have installed OpenSSL 0.9.8i, which includes EC support. However, when I attempt to import the `EC` and `BIO` modules from M2Crypto using the command `from M2Crypto import EC, BIO`, I encounter an error message stating that `EC_init()` has failed.

To diagnose the issue, I added a debug statement to print the value of `m2.OPENSSL_VERSION_TEXT`. The output is "OpenSSL 0.9.7 19 Feb 2003," which indicates that M2Crypto is still using an older version of OpenSSL that does not support EC.

I attempted to rebuild M2Crypto with the new OpenSSL version by running:
```sh
python setup.py build build_ext --openssl=new_path_to_OpenSSL_0.9.8i
```
and then installing it with:
```sh
python setup.py install
```

However, even after these steps, M2Crypto continues to use the old version of OpenSSL. 

### Possible Solution

One potential solution is to ensure that the shared libraries (`libssl.so` and `libcrypto.so`) are correctly linked to the new OpenSSL version. You can do this by adding the path to the new OpenSSL libraries at the top of the `/etc/ld.so.conf` file. This will prioritize the new libraries over the old ones. After modifying the file, run:
```sh
sudo ldconfig
```
to update the dynamic linker's cache.

However, this approach might cause issues with other applications that expect the old OpenSSL version. To avoid this, you could set the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable to point to the new OpenSSL libraries only for the specific Python session or script where you are using M2Crypto:
```sh
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=new_path_to_OpenSSL_0.9.8i/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
python your_script.py
```

This way, you can ensure that M2Crypto uses the correct version of OpenSSL without affecting other applications.
