User: Python project looks like this:

setup.py
README
Application
    scripts
        hello.py
    shell_scripts
        date.sh

From hello.py I'm executing the command subprocess.call(['../shell_scripts/date.sh']) and receiving the error OSError: [Errno 8] Exec format error.
Note: date.sh is a perfectly valid shell script and is executable. I've also tried os.path.realpath to no avail.
I assume this is due to an invalid path?
Assistant: Exec format error will come when the shell isn't set at the script. try adding #!/bin/sh at the beginning of the script and execute the python script.
