Abstract. Password meters and policies are currently the only tools
helping users to create stronger passwords. However, such tools often
do not provide consistent or useful feedback to users, and their sug-
gestions may decrease memorability of resulting passwords. Passwords
that are diﬃcult to remember promote bad practices, such as writing
them down or password reuse, thus stronger passwords do not necessarily
improve authentication security. In this work, we propose GuidedPass –
a system that suggests real-time password modiﬁcations to users, which
preserve the password’s semantic structure, while increasing password
strength. Our suggestions are based on structural and semantic patterns
mined from successfully recalled and strong passwords in several IRB-
approved user studies [30]. We compare our approach to password cre-
ation with creation under NIST [12] policy, Ur et al. [26] guidance, and
zxcvbn password-meter. We show that GuidedPass outperforms compet-
ing approaches both in password strength and in recall performance.

1 Introduction
Left to their own devices, users create passwords, which may be weak but which
are memorable. Current systems attempt to improve this practice in two ways.
First, systems can suggest or enforce speciﬁc password composition policies,
which lead to stronger passwords. But stringent password composition require-
ments increase users’ frustration and lead them to write down or reuse their
passwords [16], which is a bad practice. It has also been shown that password
composition policies are not consistent across diﬀerent sites [9,17,20,27], which
indicates lack of clear understanding of the role that password composition plays
in determining password strength. NIST recently proposed a new password com-
position policy [12], which enforces minimum of 8 characters and requires sys-
tems to reject inputs that appear on the list of previously-leaked passwords or
common dictionary words.

Another way to improve password strength is to oﬀer real-time feedback
on the user’s password and, optionally, suggestions for improvements. Password
meters oﬀer real-time feedback on user password strength [17,29], although this
feedback may be inconsistent [9,17,20,27]. Password meters, however, only pro-
vide strength feedback in form of a number or color scale, but do not oﬀer
guidance on how to modify the user input into a stronger one, while preserving
memorability. A data-driven password meter by Ur et al. [26], provides proactive
and actionable suggestions to a user on how to make their password stronger.
This approach, however, focuses only on improving strength and does not con-
sider how the proposed modiﬁcations may impair memorability.
We propose GuidedPass – a system, which helps users create both memorable
and secure passwords at creation time, through detailed suggestions for improve-
ment of password structure and semantics. First, we start from an observation
that memorability stems both from the choice of words used in the password
(e.g., phrases, names, numbers, dates of personal signiﬁcance) and the password
structure (e.g., word, followed by digits). We then tailor our suggestions in such a
way to preserve the initial user-supplied strings and structure, as much as possi-
ble, while improving password strength. Our main contributions are summarized
below:
(1) Identiﬁcation of semantic patterns, which make passwords mem-
orable and strong: We analyze 3,260 passwords, which were successfully
recalled by participants in our prior IRB-approved user studies [30], to iden-
tify semantic patterns that make these passwords both memorable, and
strong. We call these preferred patterns.
(2) Design of a real-time password suggestion system(GuidedPass):
We design a system, which chooses a set of preferred patterns, which are
closest to the user’s input, and provides meaningful suggestions for gentle
structural and semantic modiﬁcation of the user’s initial input.
(3) GuidedPass evaluation: We evaluate GuidedPass and several compet-
ing approaches in a user study, with more than 1,400 Amazon Mechanical
Turk participants. We show that passwords with GuidedPass suggestions are
both more memorable and stronger than passwords created by competing
approaches. GuidedPass achieves 81% recall after two days, and the average
strength of more than 1019 statistical guesses.Compared to the approach by
Ur et al. [26], GuidedPass has 14% higher recall, and up to 100 times higher
strength.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. We discuss related work in
Sect. 2. We present our methodology in Sect. 3. Memorable password dataset is
analyzed in Sect. 4. We present the GuidedPass system design in Sect. 5. We
detail the setup of our user study in Sect. 6. Section 7 presents the results of
our evaluation of GuidedPass, and competing approaches, and Sect. 8 oﬀer our
discussion and conclusions.

2 Background and Related Work
Password composition policies are regularly used to steer users toward stronger
passwords. The most common password policy is the 3class8 policy, which
requires a password to be at least 8 characters long, and to include at least three
out of four character classes: digits, uppercase and lowercase letters, and special
characters. There are many inconsistencies among password policies [10,24], and
a lack of clear understanding on which policy is the best.
Even when users meet the 3class8 policy requirements, their passwords can
still be weak because they are created using common words and phrases. For
example Password123 satisﬁes 3class8 requirement but is among top 33,523 out
of 14,344,391 passwords and occurs 62 times in leaked RockYou datasets. In [18],
Kelly et al. found that passwords created under minimum 8 characters policy
are signiﬁcantly weaker than passwords created under stricter policies. Shay et
al. [21] compared eight diﬀerent password composition policies and found that
a long password with fewer constraints can be more usable and stronger than a
short password with more constraints. Overly strict password composition poli-
cies may also lead to unsafe practices, such as writing down passwords [23].
NIST [12] recently proposed a new password composition policy, which removes
requirements for diﬀerent character classes, but keeps the length requirement.
The system is also required to check users’ passwords against any previously
leaked passwords, and against common dictionary words. While this feedback
informs the users on what parts of their password may be susceptible to a guess-
ing attack, it does not provide clear guidance on how to build a better password.
Such guidance is needed, to help users make signiﬁcant improvements to their
password strength, instead of small, predictable changes [14].
Password complexity does not necessarily mean low recall. Bonneau and
Schechter [4] show that users can be trained to remember randomly-assigned 56
bit codes, but such training is hardly practical for tens of passwords accounts,
which users need daily [15]. Users can be helped to create strong passwords
by using a password meter [9,22,27], or a composition of password meters and
password composition policy [20,23]. Meters, however, are not enough. They are
inconsistent in strength estimation [6], and they do not oﬀer speciﬁc suggestions
on how to modify passwords to improve their strength.
Telepathwords [19] provide proactive suggestions to users during password
creation. The system learns character distributions in its existing password data,
and uses it to highlight frequent character patterns in user input. Users are thus
steered towards less likely patterns. Telepathwords’ increase password strength
by 3.7 bits of zxcvbn [29] entropy measure, but recall declines to 62% of the base-
line, because users are steered from words that are meaningful to them towards
those with lower personal signiﬁcance. GuidedPass addresses this problem, by
allowing users to keep their current inputs, and gently morph them into stronger
passwords. While we did not compare memorability of GuidedPass passwords
to that of original user inputs, GuidedPass achieves 81% recall after two days,
compared to 62% for Telepathwords.

The most related work to GuidedPass is the data-driven password meter
by Ur et al. [26] – DataPass for brevity. DataPass provides real-time, speciﬁc
guidance to users on how to improve their passwords. It also identiﬁes a range
of inputs that should be avoided such as dictionary words, common passwords,
etc. The main point of diﬀerence between GuidedPass and DataPass is in how
password suggestions are developed. DataPass mines weak password patterns
from leaked password datasets, but it has no way of learning which passwords
are memorable to their users. Conversely, we use a labeled dataset of passwords
from our prior studies [30] to learn which patterns appear much more often
among memorable and strong passwords, than among other subsets. This enables
us to make suggestions that both improve strength and preserve memorability.
In Sect. 7, we provide side-by-side comparison of suggestions generated from
GuidedPass and DataPass, and point their diﬀerences. GuidedPass outperforms
DataPass both in password recall and in password strength.

Pass)
3 Methodology
Our process for the GuidedPass development is illustrated in Fig. 1. We start
with the observation that it is necessary to analyze passwords that are both
memorable and strong, to learn about their structure and semantics. This can-
not be accomplished by analyzing leaked datasets, since these datasets lack recall
information. Over three years, we have collected passwords for various authen-
tication research. These passwords were created during our studies, and were
successfully recalled, in the course of the study, after two days. The dataset
includes more than 3,200 passwords.
We leverage these successfully recalled passwords to understand general pat-
terns, which also make these passwords strong. We measure the strength of
memorable passwords, using the Monte Carlo method by Dell’Amico, and Fil-
ippone [8]. We train the guessing algorithm with a total of 21 million leaked
passwords. Based on the estimated passwords’ strength, we classiﬁed each pass-
word into the weak, medium or strong category, using the estimated number of
guesses for online (106) and oﬄine (1014) attacks as boundaries between cate-
gories [11].

After classifying memorable passwords into three diﬀerent strength groups,
we perform both syntactic analysis – such as recording password length and
composition – and semantic analysis – such as understanding if password seg-
ments are dictionary words, personal names, etc. For semantic analysis, we used
Vera et al.’s semantic segmentation parser [28] to segment the password and
label each segment. We then compare and analyze the syntactic and semantic
structures between groups, and identify patterns that occur predominantly in
the strong category. We call these the preferred patterns.
Next, out of the preferred patterns we generate suggestions to users, which
are easy to understand and simple to follow, on how to evolve their initial input
into a strong password. We present several suggestions so that a user can choose
the one they prefer, and which may have the least impact on password recall. We
also strive to keep our suggestions “fuzzy” and not too speciﬁc, to increase search
space for attackers who are familiar with GuidedPass. Our suggestion process
can also be iterative – suggestions can continue until the user’s password exceeds
some desired strength.
4 Memorable Password Analysis
Using the Monte Carlo method by Dell’Amico and Filippone [8], we classiﬁed
each memorable password in our dataset into the weak (fewer than 106 guesses),
medium or strong (more than 1014 guesses) category. Among our memorable
passwords, almost 27% of passwords fell into the strong category, 70% into the
medium category and 3% into the weak category, as shown in Table 1.

and percentage of 3class8 passwords in each strength group

4.1 Syntactic Characteristics
We ﬁrst analyze the passwords in each category with respect to length, number
of character classes, and class changes. We summarize our ﬁndings below.
3class8 Policy Neither Necessary Nor Suﬃcient: We show the percentage
of password that meet the 3class8 requirement in each category in Table 1. 74.2%
of strong passwords, 58.1% of medium-strength passwords and 6% of weak pass-
words meet the 3class8 requirement. This clearly shows that 3class8 requirement
GuidedPass: Helping Users to Create Strong and Memorable Passwords
255
is neither necessary (25.8% of strong passwords do not meet it) nor suﬃcient
(signiﬁcant number of medium-strength and weak passwords meet it) for a strong
password.
Password Length Makes a Big Diﬀerence: Password length plays a crit-
ical role in determining password strength [15]. The average password length
in the weak, medium, and strong group was 8.83, 9.88, and 13.73 characters,
respectively. The length distribution was signiﬁcantly diﬀerent across strong,
median, and weak strength groups (KW test p = 9.87 × 10−151), while the dif-
ference is smaller but still signiﬁcant between weak and medium groups (Holm-
Bonferonni-corrected Mann-Whitney U, HC-MWU, test, p = 2.31 × 10−5). The
statistical diﬀerence between medium and strong group is signiﬁcant (HC-MWU
test, p = 3.11 × 10−142). Hence, stronger passwords tend to be longer.

Digits and Uppercase Letters Improve Strength: We show the number
of symbols, digits, and uppercase letters in Table 2. All strength groups have
similar statistics for the number of symbols and there is no statistical diﬀerence
between them. However, there is signiﬁcant statistical diﬀerence with regard to
the number of digits present in weak, medium, and strong passwords (KW test,
p = 2.66 × 10−43), with stronger passwords having slightly higher incidence of
digits. The statistical signiﬁcance between strong and medium group with HC-
MWU test is p = 3.68 × 10−18. And HC-MWU test yields p = 5.96 × 10−24
between medium and weak group. Similarly, stronger passwords also have a
higher incidence of uppercase letters (KW test, p = 1.96×10−55). The statistical
signiﬁcance between strong and medium group with HC-MWU test is p = 1.18×
10−48. And HC-MWU test yields p = 3.73 × 10−4 between medium and weak
group.
More Class Changes Improve Strength: We deﬁne a class change as having
two consecutive characters in a password from diﬀerent character classes. For
example, “Alicebob123$” has 3 class changes (‘A’→ ‘l’, ‘b’→ ‘1’, ‘3’→ ‘$’). A
higher number of class changes can create more complex, and possibly stronger
passwords. Statistics for the number of class changes are shown in columns 8 and
9 of Table 2. As password strength increased so did the number of class changes
(KW test, p = 1.87 × 10−73). The statistical signiﬁcance between strong and
medium group with HC-MWU test was p = 4.58 × 10−47. And HC-MWU test
yields p = 1.62 × 10−27 between medium and weak group.

4.2 Semantic Structure
Next, we analyze the semantic structure of strong, medium, and weak passwords.
We use Vera et al.’s semantic parser [28] to segment each password and label the
segments with their part-of-speech (POS tags) from CLAWS7 tagset [25]. For
example, for a string “applerun” the string would return segments (apple)(run)
and tags (nn1)(vv0) indicating a singular noun and a base form of a verb. This
representation captures the underlying semantic structures of passwords, which
cannot be represented by the previously discussed syntactic features. We fur-
ther label segments as (dict): dictionary words,(fname): popular female names,
(mname): popular male names, and (sname): popular last names from 2010
US Census [1]. Also, we separately check if passwords match with leaked pass-
words, as suggested by others [14,26,29]. We use leaked passwords from Xato
corpus [5] and label user inputs found in the corpus as leak. Such a label is
shown to user to alert them not to use the leaked password.
Complex and Unique Patterns Improve Strength: After processing each
password with the semantic segmentation program, we count the total number
of unique tag-sequences in each group and compute the percentage of those. We
