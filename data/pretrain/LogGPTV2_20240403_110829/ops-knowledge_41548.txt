To effectively implement CIS Control 15.1, "Establish and Maintain an Inventory of Service Providers," an organization should follow these key procedures:

1. **Create a Comprehensive Inventory:**
   - Develop and maintain a detailed inventory that lists all known service providers.
   - Include relevant classifications for each service provider (e.g., type of service, criticality, and compliance requirements).
   - Designate an enterprise contact responsible for each service provider to ensure clear communication and accountability.

2. **Regular Review and Updates:**
   - Conduct an annual review of the inventory to ensure it remains current and accurate.
   - Update the inventory whenever significant changes occur within the enterprise that could impact the safeguard, such as new service providers, changes in service scope, or organizational restructuring.

3. **Classification and Security Function:**
   - Note that CIS Control 15.1 is categorized under the asset type "N/A" and falls under the security function "Identify."
   - Ensure that the inventory aligns with the broader identify function, which involves understanding the organization's environment and managing assets to reduce risk.

By following these steps, an organization can effectively manage and maintain a comprehensive and up-to-date inventory of its service providers, thereby enhancing its overall security posture.
