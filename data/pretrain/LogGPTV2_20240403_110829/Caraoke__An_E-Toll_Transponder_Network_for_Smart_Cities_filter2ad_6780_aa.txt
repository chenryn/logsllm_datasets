ABSTRACT
Electronic toll collection transponders, e.g., E-ZPass, are
a widely-used wireless technology. About 70% to 89% of
the cars in US have these devices, and some states plan to
make them mandatory. As wireless devices however, they
lack a basic function: a MAC protocol that prevents colli-
sions. Hence, today, they can be queried only with direc-
tional antennas in isolated spots. However, if one could in-
teract with e-toll transponders anywhere in the city despite
collisions, it would enable many smart applications. For ex-
ample, the city can query the transponders to estimate the ve-
hicle ﬂow at every intersection. It can also localize the cars
using their wireless signals, and detect those that run a red-
light. The same infrastructure can also deliver smart street-
parking, where a user parks anywhere on the street, the city
localizes his car, and automatically charges his account.
This paper presents Caraoke, a networked system for de-
livering smart services using e-toll transponders. Our design
operates with existing unmodiﬁed transponders, allowing
for applications that communicate with, localize, and count
transponders, despite wireless collisions. To do so, Caraoke
exploits the structure of the transponders’ signal and its prop-
erties in the frequency domain. We built Caraoke reader into
a small PCB that harvests solar energy and can be easily de-
ployed on street lamps. We also evaluated Caraoke on four
streets on our campus and demonstrated its capabilities.

INTRODUCTION
Electronic toll collection transponders are simple devices
consisting of a battery-powered RFID. They are perhaps
among the most-widely used wireless communication tech-
nologies. In the US, depending on the state, 70% to 89%
of the cars have such transponders [56, 2, 46, 9]. Further,
the numbers are growing rapidly. The state of Pennsylva-
nia has announced that E-ZPass will be mandatory on all
highways in 2018. The state of California already requires
drivers to have the transponder mounted on the windshield
per state law in order to drive in the Express-Lanes [55, 9].
Other states are following suit motivated by Congress’s de-
cision to have a national electronic toll-collection system by
2016 [4, 9]. Because of this wide-deployment and antici-
pated growth, multiple businesses are looking into leverag-
ing e-toll transponders to deliver new services. For example,
e-toll transponders are currently used to pay for food at some
drive-through restaurants [28], and to automate payment at
parking garages [5].
More generally, there is a big opportunity for using e-toll
transponders to enable smart cities. For example, the city
could deploy readers on trafﬁc lights to query the transpon-
ders and track the number of cars at every intersection. It can
then use the information to adapt the timing of trafﬁc lights
to minimize the average wait time for the green light. It can
also leverage RF-based localization to localize cars using
their transponders’ signals, detect cars that run a red-light,
and automatically charge their accounts for a ticket. Readers
deployed on street-lamps can detect speeding on every street
in the city and ticket the offending car, without the need for
car-mounted radars and hidden police ofﬁcers. The same in-
frastructure can deliver smart street-parking systems, where
a user parks anywhere on the street, the city localizes his car,
and automatically charges his account.
297Unfortunately, today there is a major challenge that ham-
pers the use of e-toll transponders in smart city services, like
the ones described above. Speciﬁcally, e-toll transponders
are designed under the assumption that only one transponder
transmits at any point in time, and hence have no MAC pro-
tocol to prevent collisions.1 Collection systems use restricted
deployments and highly directional antennas to ensure that
only one car responds to the reader’s query. Without this
physical isolation, all transponders in range would transmit
simultaneously, creating collisions. One could think of re-
placing the current transponders with new transponders that
support a MAC protocol. Replacing the large infrastructure
of deployed transponders however would take a long time
and incur a major cost.2 In contrast, developing for current
transponders allows the cities to obtain immediate beneﬁts
even with a small installation on some of the busier streets
and intersections. Yet to do that, the system has to deliver its
smart services in the presence of wireless collisions.
This paper presents Caraoke, a networked system for de-
livering smart services using existing e-toll transponders.
Caraoke also presents a new reader design that can count,
localize, and estimate the speed of the cars on the road using
collision signals from their e-toll transponders. The key fea-
ture that enables Caraoke to work in the presence of collision
is its ability to exploit the carrier frequency offset (CFO) of
the transponders. Speciﬁcally, since e-toll transponders are
active RFIDs, each device has an independent oscillator, and
hence it experiences a carrier frequency offset (CFO). Tra-
ditional wireless systems view the CFO as a harmful phe-
nomenon that the receiver has to compensate for in order
to correctly decode. In contrast, we show that we can lever-
age the CFO of the transponders to zoom in on individual
transponders in the presence of collisions.
In particular, we consider the collision in the frequency
domain as opposed to the time domain, and show that each
collision exhibits spikes that correspond to the CFOs of the
colliding transponders. Further, e-toll transponders have par-
ticularly large CFOs that span 1.2MHz [36], creating a sig-
niﬁcant separation between the spikes. Thus, we can estimate
the number of transponders by counting these spikes.
We also show that we can use the differences in CFO to
measure the wireless channels to the individual transpon-
ders, and hence apply RF-based localization to track cars
and measure their speeds. Caraoke can also decode the IDs
of the colliding transponders, say to charge a car for park-
ing or speeding. To do this, Caraoke leverages the channels
and CFO measurements to combine multiple collisions in a
manner that the signals from the target transponder add up
coherently, whereas the signals of other colliding transpon-
ders combine incoherently. This allows Caraoke to boost the
SNR of the target transponder above the others, and enable
it to decode the ID of the target transponder.
To demonstrate the practicality of Caraoke, we built
Caraoke reader into a custom designed printed circuit board
(PCB). Our prototype, shown in Fig. 1, is both small and
low-cost, making it amenable to large-scale deployment.3
Further it is designed as a plug and play device; It connects
to the Internet via an LTE modem and harvests its energy
from solar power, making it easy to deploy on street-lamps.
We have evaluated Caraoke on four campus streets. We
ran multiple experiments with cars that have standard E-
ZPass transponders. Our results show the following:
• Caraoke can count transponders accurately despite colli-
sions. The average error in the Caraoke estimator is 2%,
and the 90th percentile is less than 5%, which is signif-
icantly more accurate than existing camera-based trafﬁc
tracking systems [43, 54].
• Caraoke can accurately localize cars into parking spots.
Its average location accuracy is 4 degrees. This accuracy
is sufﬁcient for detecting occupied/available parking spots
between two street lamps.
• Across experiments where we varied the car speed from
10 mile/hour to 40 mile/hour, Caraoke has detected the
speed to within 8% (i.e., 1 to 3 mile/hour). The same ac-
curacy was observed in a second set of experiments con-
ducted in an empty lot with a car speed of 50 mile/hour.4
• Caraoke successfully decodes transponder ids in the pres-
ence of collisions, but the time required to decode in-
creases with the number of colliding transponders. In par-
ticular, decoding the ids of a pair of colliding transponders
takes 4.2 ms, whereas decoding ﬁve colliding ids takes
16.2 ms.
• Measurements of the Caraoke reader show that it con-
sumes only 9mW in average (excluding modem), which
is 56× lower than what it can harvest from its solar panel.
2. RELATED WORK
(a) Communication and Localization: Caraoke builds on
a rich literature on RFIDs. Past research however has typi-
cally focused on EPC RFIDs, like those used in access con-
trol and inventory tracking [22, 30]. Such RFIDs do sup-
port a MAC protocol and hence can communicate without
major collisions. In contrast, e-toll transponders use a dif-
ferent protocol that has no MAC support. We note however
that past works [58, 34] proposed methods to decode concur-
rent transmissions from backscatter sensors in time domain.
However, such designs are inapplicable to our scenario be-
cause they require hardware modiﬁcation of the RFIDs and
do not work with existing e-toll transponders.
Our work is also related to past work on RFID localiza-
tion and RF-based positioning [60, 29, 59, 63, 26]. While we
build on the general area of AoA localization, our approach
1This is unlike traditional RFIDs used in access control or
retail, which have a MAC protocol.
2There were more than 26 million transponders deployed
just by E-ZPass as of 2013 [1]. In addition, there are a large
number of additional transponders deployed by other agen-
cies such as FasTrak, etc.
3 The board is about the size of a credit card and cost less
than $40 which can be dramatically reduced with mass pro-
duction.
4Almost all states in the US have residential speed limits be-
low 35 mile/hour, and the maximum residential speed limit
in any state is 45 mile/hour [8].
298differs in that it exploits CFO differences to localize the de-
vices using colliding signals, without even decoding.
There are also commercial RFID readers which are solar
powered [7]. However, unlike Caraoke, these readers can not
localize, count and identify RFIDs in the presence of wire-
less collisions.
Finally, a vast majority of past research on issues related
to CFO focuses on how to eliminate or estimate the CFO and
compensate for it [12, 49, 48, 52]. The closest to our work
is [18], which advocates using the CFO of a device as an id
for security purposes. None of this work however deals with
collisions or the use of CFO for localization or decoding.
(b) Smart Cities: Our work is motivated by the growing in-
terest in smart cities, where urban services are automated
to improve efﬁciency, and reduce waste and pollution [42,
35, 25]. Past work in this area focuses on transportation re-
search [61], software applications [20], and social and eco-
nomic issues [14]. In contrast, we focus on wireless network-
ing issues such as communication, localization, and counting
in the presence of wireless collisions.
There are also a few businesses that market solutions for
one of Caraoke’s applications. In particular, some apps allow
a user to pay for parking using her phone [19]. Those apps
however do not address the cost and overhead incurred by
the city in checking for parking violations and issuing tick-
ets. Further, they do not automatically detect the occupancy
of parking spots. Alternative solutions like Streetline install
a sensor in the asphalt pavement of every parking spot [51].
They need to drill the street in every spot incurring a sig-
niﬁcant cost and causing trafﬁc disturbances. There are also
trafﬁc cameras installed in some cities for counting the cars
at the corresponding trafﬁc light and providing trafﬁc statis-
tics [38]. These systems are highly sensitive to occlusions, il-
lumination, shadowing, and wind [43]. Finally, trafﬁc radars
are typically used to measure car speeds. These devices how-
ever cannot tell which speed is associated with which car. A
police ofﬁcer has to be around to identify the speeding car
based on the orientation of the device [24]. In contrast to all
of the above, Caraoke is a single system that can support all
of these applications, and address many of the drawbacks of
existing solutions.
(c) VANET: There is a large literature on vehicle networks,
or VANET. Research in that area addresses the impact of
mobility on ad hoc networks [40]. It focuses on routing [39],
quality of service [62], and reliability [64]. It runs on typical
communication devices that support a MAC protocol, e.g.,
WiFi and WiMAX [21, 44].Our work differs from this past
work in objectives and techniques. Speciﬁcally, our goal is
to enable smart cities to leverage the widely-deployed e-toll
transponders to deliver new services such as smart-parking
and real-time trafﬁc monitoring. Our solutions target a differ-
ent communication technology, namely e-toll transponders.
Such transponders lack a MAC protocol, necessitating new
designs that differ from those used in VANET.

an inquiry transmitted by the reader. The reader is typically
placed in the tollbooth whereas the transponder is attached
to the car’s windshield. Both transponder and reader work at
915MHz. The query signal is simply a sinewave transmitted
at the carrier frequency (i.e. 915MHz) for a short period of
time. The transponder responds with its id, which identiﬁes
the driver’s account. Fig. 2(a) illustrates the timing of the
query signal and the transponder’s response to it.
A few points are worth noting:
• In contrast to traditional RFIDs (e.g., those used in re-
tail or access control),5 the active RFIDs used in e-
toll transponders lack a medium access protocol (MAC).
Thus, once a transponder detects the reader’s signal, it
immediately transmits its response. Hence, if multiple
transponders are in the reader’s range, they all respond
leading to a collision. Toll systems avoid the need for a
MAC by using highly directional antennas, and the fact
that cars are separated by a minimum distance.
• E-toll transponders also have a relatively large CFO. Their
carrier frequencies vary between 914.3MHz and 915.5
MHz, and hence their CFO can be as high as 1.2MHz [36].
• The simplicity of the transponders results in a cheap and
low power device. A transponder can work for 10 years
before it runs out of battery, and it operates whether the
car is on or off.
• Finally, for the purpose of this paper, it is important to
understand the properties of the transponder signal. The
transponder transmits its data using on-off keying (OOK)
modulation. OOK is a simple modulation, where the radio
transmits a “1 bit” by transmitting the carrier frequency,
and transmits a “0 bit” by staying silent. This means that
the transponder’s signal corresponds to the presence and
absence of the carrier sinewave. Thus, the transmitted sig-
nal can be written as:
x(t) = s(t) · ej2π·fc·t,
(1)
where s(t) is a binary square-wave baseband signal tog-
gling between 0 and 1, and fc is the carrier frequency. The
5Most research targets Electronic Product Code (EPC)
RFIDs, which have an Aloha-style MAC protocol [23].
299This paper is focused on the design and implementation of
the Caraoke and a small-scale evaluation of the deployment
of multiple Caraoke readers on a campus street. Before delv-
ing into the details of our design, we note the following two
points regarding scope:
• Our objective is to automate smart services, eliminating
the personnel cost, and improving the overall accuracy in
comparison to the status quo. Note that the current alter-
natives suffer from signiﬁcant errors. For example, about
10% to 30% of the speeding tickets based on trafﬁc radars
are estimated to be incorrect [6]. The errors are mostly
due to the fact that radars cannot associate a speed with
a particular car. This task is left to the police ofﬁcer and
hence is prone to human mistakes [6]. Similarly, errors in
