User: I have an Intel T9550 64-bit processor with 32-bit Windows Vista. I want to install Python 2.7.1 onto my PC. From the python.org website, which installer should I use:

"Python 2.7.1 Windows Installer"?
or "Python 2.7.1 Windows X86-64 Installer"?

The latter one is for x86-64. I don't understand if this bit refers to the processor or the OS.
Assistant: Even though you have a 64-bit processor, your OS is of a 32-bit flavour. The Windows installer for Python targets the OS it is built on, not just the processor. Since your OS is 32-bit, you can only install the regular 32-bit Python 2.7.1 Windows installer.
Note that you can install both 32-bit (under a 32-bit emulation) and x86-64 flavours of Python installer had you have Windows 64-bit on your machine.
