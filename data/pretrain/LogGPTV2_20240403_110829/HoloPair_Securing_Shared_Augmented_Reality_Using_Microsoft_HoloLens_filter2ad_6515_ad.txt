device in comparison to previous AR devices that do not support
precise world anchoring, we here emphasize the importance of re-
evaluating existing design practices for various security primitives
as they are being implemented in mixed reality.
9 RELATED WORK
General Device Pairing. Comprehensive overviews of a many
different device pairing methods and their usability evaluations
can be found in [15, 16]. For a recent work that extensively sur-
veyed multiple shared secret confirmation steps for mobile devices
and evaluated user’s ability to detect potential attacks, see [24].
However, given that neither the two users is able to observe the
output of both headsets, we are unable to directly apply previous
work to the AR headset scenario. Secondly, in contrast to previous
work in which users are required to e.g. copy some value from one
device to the other, we make the assumption that the adversary
can fully eavesdrop even the out-of-band channel. Considering the
proliferation of augmented reality headsets and the fact that each
of them has multiple front facing cameras, we believe this to be a
necessary assumption.
Finally, despite previous proposals to e.g. shake mobile phones
simultaneously and distribute the shared secrets this way [21], there
is no obvious way to expose two AR headsets to the same outside
conditions that a co-located adversary could not easily copy.
Given that even a simple comparison of visual outputs from two
headsets is non-trivial, the problem of pairing AR headsets is likely
to become an active topic of future security and usability research.
Securing augmented reality. The general topic of privacy and se-
curity of AR devices has recently gained traction, with researchers
laying our general topics of interest [18] and discussing how to
ensure that AR output on multi-app devices does not become dan-
gerous [19]. Privacy research focused on building a hierarchy of
visual recognizers to protect sensitive contexts [14] and, similarly,
privately-preserving support for 3D browsers [26], the ability to
show applications floating at specific locations in a room (similar
to Figure 1).. Moreover, a recent paper discussed the system and
implementation-level security of the existing "AR browsers", plat-
forms which allow overlaying 2D objects over a mobile device’s
camera output [22].
Secure pairing of AR headsets. Given the novelty of the AR
headsets and the very recent availability of mixed reality headsets,
the topic of AR pairing has not yet been extensively explored, with
only a single related paper with the same focus [9]. However, the
authors take a significantly different approach, by building their
own hardware prototype which assumes that future AR headsets
will have the support (multiple antennas) to perform precise wire-
less localization. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the
first security-focused research that uses the novel capabilities of
Microsoft’s HoloLens device to achieve usable and secure pairing
of two AR headsets. Moreover, this work is the first proposes for
a practically achievable AR headset pairing protocol that assumes
only the existing capabilities of the HoloLens device.
10 CONCLUSION
In this paper we propose HoloPair, protocol and a system for se-
cure and usable pairing of augmented reality headsets. We build a
working prototype implementation of HoloPair using two Microsoft
HoloLens headsets, full-fledged AR devices that have recently be-
come available to developers in US and several other countries. By
running a user study with a total of N=22 participants, we eval-
uate the feasibility of the proposed protocol in terms of security
guarantees, usability, and prototype performance.
The experimental evaluation of the HoloPair prototype shows
that participants with little or no prior experience using AR headsets
are able to achieve high rates of detecting attack simulations or
successfully pairing when no attack is simulated. Furthermore,
the system is highly usable, as evident by short pairing times and
high average scores achieved on the usability questionnaire, while
having low computational requirements.
As shared collaboration that includes both holographic and real-
world objects is at the core of current and future applications of
AR, the ability for developers to secure direct connections between
their users is of crucial importance.
Towards this goal, we have made our full prototype implementa-
tion and source code available online, and our prototype is started
the process to have our solution integrated into the official HoloLens
development kit. Considering the lack of practical proposals or im-
plementations of secure device pairing, despite the rapid growth
of AR platforms, we believe that this work is an important step in
making future AR interactions secure and private from the start.

APPENDIX
A SUS QUESTIONS
The System Usability Scale [5] is a widely used 10 statement ques-
tionnaire, with Likert-scale answers (0 - "Strongly disagree" to 4 -
"Strongly agree"). The overall usability score for an individual user
is computed by summing the answers to odd-positioned questions
(Q1, Q3, ...) and subtracting the answers on even-positioned ques-
tions (Q2, Q4, ...). The score is finally centered and scaled to [0, 100]
by adding 20 and multiplying the resulting value with 2.5.
The 10 SUS questions are:
(1) I think that I would like to use this system frequently.
(2) I found the system unnecessarily complex.
(3) I thought the system was easy to use.
(4) I think that I would need the support of a technical person
to be able to use this system.
(5) I found the various functions in this system were well inte-
grated.
(6) I thought there was too much inconsistency in this system.
(7) I would imagine that most people would learn to use this
system very quickly.
(8) I found the system very cumbersome to use.
(9) I felt very confident using the system.
(10) I needed to learn a lot of things before I could get going with
this system.
As UB is additionally required to move their hand in one of the
four directions, this further increases the number entropy of the
weak-hash to (4 × 4)N and decreases the probability of a successful
attack to:
Pb(N) =
= 1
16N
1
(4 × 4)N
(a) "Touch the larger cubes according to the color
sequence of length N ."
(b) "Touch the cube and then swipe in one of 4
directions as indicated by the arrows."
(c) Follow the shape with your hand."
Figure 9: Three different versions of the shared secret confirmation step that we use in this paper. In (a), UA confirms that UB
is touching the correct sequence of colored cubes. In (b), after touching any of the cubes, UB is required to also swipe their
hand in one of the 4 directions (depicted by arrows). Finally, in (c), UB follows the 3D shape in front of him with his hand,
while UA confirms that the shape shown on his DA matches the hand movement (and correspondingly the shape on DB).
B ALTERNATIVE SHARED SECRET
CONFIRMATION STEPS
HoloPair does not rely on any specific form of the shared secret
confirmation step. Consequently, in our research we designed, de-
veloped, and evaluated three different versions of this confirmation
step, shown in Figure 9. We now describe the initial two schemes
that were tested, before deciding to focus on the final scheme (based
on virtual pipes), that was described throughout the paper.
(a) - "Cubes": Our initial design choice was based on the idea of
having a shared keyboard that one user would touch, while the
other observes the gestures and verifies that they are correct. As
shown in Figure 9a, in order to ensure a simple user experience,
UB is required to look at the sequence of colors shown at the
bottom of their screen and accordingly touch one of the four larger
cubes to communicate the value of the weak-hash generated on his
headset. At the same time, UA’s device independently generates
the sequence of N and shows the four larger cubes at the same
location as UB’s device. UA observes if UB’s sequence of colors
indeed match, and thus verifies high probability that the exchanged
public keys are indeed authentic.
This results in the total number of different configurations that
can be presented with N colors to be 4N , and correspondingly, the
expected probability of successfully guessing an alternative pair of
public keys for an attacker to be:
Pa(N) = 1
4N
(b) - "Cubes with Arrows": In an extension of the first variant,
shown in Figure 9b, the weak-hash that is independently generated
on both devices also specifies one of 4 directions for each of the
colors in the sequence. Correspondingly, UB is required not only
to touch the larger cube of the same color, but also to make a
hand movement in the direction indicated on his sequence. The
reasoning behind this version is that additional hand movement
does not significantly impact the usability of the secret confirmation
step, while it, at the same time, squares the number of possible weak
hashes that users can communicate using a sequence of length N .
