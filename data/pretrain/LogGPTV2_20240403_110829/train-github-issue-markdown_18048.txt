Editing node.js (JavaScript) files (after opening a folder), where a file
requires another module (same folder), if you want to see the definition of a
symbol (F12 or right-lick "Go to Definition") stopped working with latest
update Version 0.10.10 (0.10.10)
I use this feature frequently. It used to work fine.
