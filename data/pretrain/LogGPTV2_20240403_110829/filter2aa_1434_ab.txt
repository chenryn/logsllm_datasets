### Performance Improvements on Tor

#### 1. User-Mode IPsec Stack
Implementing a user-mode IPsec stack is a potential approach, but it would require substantial effort and may not fully leverage existing building blocks.

**Current Status:**
- Prof. Goldberg has a new student, Chris Alexander, continuing the work started by Joel.
- Chris is currently fixing bugs in OpenSSL’s implementation of DTLS and other core libraries that would be necessary if we pursue this direction.

**Impact:** High  
**Effort:** High (significant effort to integrate all components)  
**Risk:** High (high risk of additional work to get it right)

**Plan:**
- Continue working with and potentially fund Chris to advance this project.
- Deploy a separate testing Tor network using datagram protocols based on patches from Joel and others.
- Aim for deployment of this testbed network by late 2009.

#### 1.2 Tor’s Congestion Control Window Sizes
Tor uses a per-circuit maximum of unacknowledged cells (CIRCWINDOW). If this value is exceeded, it is assumed the circuit is congested, and the originator stops sending. Kiraly proposed reducing this window size to decrease latency without affecting throughput.

**Current Configuration:**
- Circuit window size: 512KB
- Per-stream window size: 256KB

**Effects of Reducing Chunk Size:**
- Reduced memory usage at relays due to fewer and smaller chunks.
- Lower latency as fewer bytes compete for network resources at each hop.

**Investigation Findings:**
- Optimal circuit window size: 100KB (tested for fixed network latency and relay bandwidth).
- Further investigation needed for networks with different characteristics.

**Impact:** Medium (steady-state improvement, but transition period uncertain)
**Effort:** Low (a few lines of code)
**Risk:** Medium (potential need for adjustments during transition)

**Plan:**
- Integrate the patch into Tor 0.2.2.x and set the lowest possible window setting to 100 cells (50KB).
- Monitor performance and make adjustments as needed.

#### 2. Managing Overload from High-Volume Users
Section 1 described mechanisms to ensure fair competition between low-volume and high-volume streams. However, some users still add more load than the network can handle.

**Design Considerations:**
- Original design aimed for high throughput, assuming good latency properties.
- Need to reconsider design choices to balance latency and throughput for different user profiles.

#### 2.1 Squeeze Over-Active Circuits
The Tor 0.2.0.30 release introduced changes to buffer data more efficiently. Instead of a large ring buffer, cells are now queued per circuit, allowing for smarter traffic prioritization.

**Proposed Changes:**
- Prioritize circuits that have sent fewer cells recently.
- Gradual deployment as relays upgrade, providing flexibility and rapid deployment benefits.

**Impact:** High (if implemented correctly)
**Effort:** Medium (code analysis and implementation)
**Risk:** High (potential feedback effects and unintended consequences)

**Plan:**
- Evaluate the complexity of changing the current code for Tor 0.2.2.x.
- Develop and test various proposals for traffic prioritization.

#### 2.2 Throttle Certain Protocols at Exits
To manage high-volume traffic, exit relays could use protocol analyzers to detect and limit bulk transfer protocols like Bittorrent.

**Concerns:**
- Wiretapping and liability issues.
- Network neutrality and user trust concerns.

**Impact:** Medium-High  
**Effort:** Medium (protocol recognition and integration)  
**Risk:** High (unwanted arms race and legal risks)

**Plan:**
- Not recommended due to significant downsides.

#### 2.3 Throttle Certain Protocols at the Client Side
Client-side detection and throttling of certain protocols could be more straightforward but presents its own challenges.

**Challenges:**
- Clients could disable the feature.
- Potential for forking and creating a "fast" version of Tor.

**Impact:** Medium-High  
**Effort:** Medium (protocol recognition and integration)  
**Risk:** High (user behavior and forking risks)

**Plan:**
- Not recommended due to significant downsides.

#### 2.4 Throttle All Streams at the Client Side
Setting stricter rate limits on client streams by default, with high bucket sizes for spikes, could help manage congestion.

**Considerations:**
- Choosing appropriate numbers for rate limiting.
- Ensuring clients cannot easily disable these checks.

**Impact:** Low initially, medium-high later  
**Effort:** Low  
**Risk:** High (potential for over-limiting or under-limiting)

**Plan:**
- Consider implementing in conjunction with other throttling measures in Tor 0.2.2.x.

#### 2.5 Default Exit Policy of 80, 443
Restricting exit policies to only allow ports 80 and 443 could reduce high-volume flows but also has downsides.

**Downsides:**
- Loss of application neutrality.
- Long-term effectiveness questionable due to corporate firewall practices.

**Impact:** Uncertain (low to high)  
**Effort:** Low  
**Risk:** High (reduced network utility)

**Plan:**
- Explore intermediate options and consider implementing in Tor 0.2.2.x.

#### 2.6 Better User Education
Improving user education about the intended use of Tor (not for high-volume streams) could complement technical measures.

**Impact:** Medium  
**Effort:** Low  
**Risk:** Low

**Plan:**
- Update FAQ and website to clarify Tor's limitations and intended use.

#### 3. Insufficient Network Capacity
Adding more capacity to the Tor network is essential but must be combined with addressing high-volume stream issues to be effective.

**Economics:**
- Increasing supply will attract more users, potentially leading to continued congestion.
- Prioritizing Sections 1 and 2 helps manage high-volume users and makes new capacity more useful.

#### 3.1 Tor Server Advocacy
Encouraging more volunteers to run and maintain Tor servers will increase network capacity and performance.

**Impact:** High  
**Effort:** Medium to High  
**Risk:** Low

**Plan:**
- Engage in advocacy and training efforts to recruit and retain more relay operators.

#### 3.1.1 Talks and Trainings
In-person conferences and talks are effective for recruiting new relays.

**Status:**
- Roger and Jake are working on this, with Jake ramping up efforts in 2009.
- Addressing government policies and their impact on volunteer willingness.

**Plan:**
- Continue and expand in-person advocacy and education efforts.

By addressing these areas, we aim to improve the overall performance and reliability of the Tor network.
