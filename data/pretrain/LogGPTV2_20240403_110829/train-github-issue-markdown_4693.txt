@Brocco ,@jmachnik  
First of all I just begin with Angular 2 and I'm trying to build a nested form
and validate it.I had posted this question on stackoverflow but dint got any
reply so raising this question as a bug .Please revert with the solution as
soon as possible .Thank you  
Here's part of my ts file:
@NgOnInit() {  
this.myForm = this.formBuilder.group({  
projects: this.formBuilder.array([  
this.initProjects()  
])  
});  
}
initProjects(): any {  
return this.formBuilder.group({  
name: ['', [Validators.required, Validators.minLength(3)]],  
some_array: this.formBuilder.array([  
this.formBuilder.group({  
name: ['', Validators.required],  
attr: ['', Validators.required],  
some_id: [1, Validators.required]  
})  
])  
});  
}
addProject(): void {  
const control =  this.myForm.controls['projects'];  
control.push(this.initProjects());  
}
View:
Nome Ã© requerido  
Submit  
form value:  
{{myForm.value | json}}  
form value:  
{  
"projects": [  
{  
"name": "",  
"some_array": [  
{  
"name": "",  
"attr": "",  
"some_id": 1  
}  
]  
},  
{  
"name": "",  
"some_array": [  
{  
"name": "",  
"attr": "",  
"some_id": 1  
}  
]  
}  
]  
}
Well, as you can see I have some arrays called projects, with 1 array inside
each one.
So the problem is that I'm not able to validate each control of some_array
array.
Actually I'm getting the following error:
ORIGINAL EXCEPTION: Cannot find control with path: 'projects -> 0 ->
controls.some_array.controls.name  
PS: I already tried to put it in a div, as below:
But I also got an error:
Cannot find control with path: 'projects -> some_array'  
Thanks in advance. Any help would be appreciated.
