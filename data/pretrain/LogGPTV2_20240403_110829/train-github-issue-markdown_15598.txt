It would be interesting to have the ability to define different word wrap
values for _different languages_ , specially if you use **Code** for editing
normal programming languages like JavaScript, Pascal and _non_ programming
languages, like Markdown.
I tend to respect the word wrap values defined in the main IDE for a
particular language (if exists/is used), and turn off word wrap for for
Markdown/Log/Text files. But today, in **Code** I only have settings for the
_Editor_ (`editor.wrappingColumn` and `editor.wrappingIndent`).
Thanks in advance
