User: I'm trying to send a python script I wrote on my Mac to my friends. Problem is, I don't want to send them the code that they can edit. How can I have my script change from an editable text file, to a program that you click to run?
Assistant: If your friends are on windows you could use py2exe, but if they're on Mac I'm not sure there's an equivalent. Either way, compiling like that breaks cross platform compatability, which is the whole point of an interpreted language really...
Python just isn't really set up to hide code like that, it's against it's philosophy as far as I can tell.
