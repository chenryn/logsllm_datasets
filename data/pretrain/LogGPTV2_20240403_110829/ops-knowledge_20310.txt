User: I know how to install *.whl files through cmd (the code is simply python -m pip install *so-and-so-.whl). But since I accidentally deleted my OS and had no backups I found myself in the predicament to reinstall all of my whl files for my work. 
This comes up to around 50 files. I can do this manually which is pretty simple, but I was wondering how to do this in a single line. I can't seem to find anything that would allow me to simply type in python -m pip install *so-and-so.whl to find all of the whl files in the directory and install them.
Any ideas?
Assistant: For installing multiple packages on the command line, just pass them as a space-delimited list, e.g.:
pip install numpy pandas
