## Abstract
We present the first detailed analysis of ad-blocking's impact on user web quality of experience (QoE). Using the most popular web-based ad-blocker, we evaluated the QoE for the top 5,000 Alexa websites. Our findings indicate that ad-blocking reduces the number of objects loaded by 15% in the median case, leading to a 12.5% improvement in page load time (PLT) but a slight worsening of time to first paint (TTFP) by 6.54%. For the bottom 10th percentile, while PLT improves by 14%, TTFP worsens by approximately 3 times more than the average. To understand the relative importance of this trade-off, we conducted a large, crowd-sourced experiment with 1,000 users on Amazon Mechanical Turk. Surprisingly, 71.5% of users preferred faster initial rendering over faster full page loads, highlighting the significance of first impressions in web QoE.

## 1. Introduction
The web advertisement industry has grown exponentially over the past decade, becoming the primary revenue source for most content providers. Recent research efforts have focused on understanding the scale, mechanisms, and economics of web advertisements. While these ads support "free" online content and services, they also raise serious security and privacy concerns, leading millions of users to adopt ad-blockers. By February 2017, at least 615 million devices had an ad-blocker installed, with usage increasing by 30% between December 2015 and 2016, according to the PageFair Adblock Report.

Despite the intuitive assumption that fewer objects would improve QoE, the exact impact of ad-blocking on perceived website performance remains unclear. This paper presents the first detailed analysis of ad-blocking's impact on user QoE, using the most popular web-based ad-blocker to evaluate the top 5,000 Alexa websites. We rely on three key metrics: Page Load Time (PLT), Time to First Paint (TTFP), and Speed Index.

Our results reveal a complex relationship between ad-blocking and web QoE. Ad-blocking reduces the number of objects loaded by 15% in the median case, translating to a 12.5% improvement in PLT and a 6.54% worsening of TTFP. For the bottom 10th percentile, while PLT improves by 14%, TTFP worsens significantly more. To understand the relative importance of this trade-off, we conducted a large, crowd-sourced experiment with 1,000 users on Amazon Mechanical Turk. Surprisingly, 71.5% of users preferred faster first paint over faster full page loads, emphasizing the importance of first impressions in web QoE.

### Main Contributions
- **First Large-Scale Evaluation:** We report on the first large-scale evaluation of the web QoE impact of ad-blocking across the top 5,000 Alexa sites.
- **Complex Relationship:** We show the complex relationship between ad-blocking and QoE, revealing that while ad-blocking improves PLT, it can significantly slow down TTFP for the bottom 10th percentile.
- **Crowd-Sourced Analysis:** We present results from the largest crowd-sourced analysis of ad-blocking's impact on QoE, involving 1,000 users on Amazon Mechanical Turk, indicating a preference for faster first paint.
- **Open Science:** We will publicly release our dataset from the controlled experiment with the top 5,000 Alexa websites and the 1,000-user crowd-sourced experiment.

## 2. Ad-Block Background
Ad-blockers are available in various formats, including browser extensions, VPN-based solutions, and full browsers like Brave and Cliqz. In this study, we focus on browser extensions, the most common format. Popular browser extensions include Ghostery, 1Blocker, NoScript, Adblock, and Adblock Plus. These ad-blockers use the browser's webRequest API to intercept and modify requests, blocking HTTP requests and hiding HTML elements based on filter rules. EasyList is the most popular filter list, containing over 69,000 rules.

For our analysis, we used Adblock Plus (ABP), which holds over 90% of the market for Firefox and Internet Explorer and nearly 50% for Google Chrome. Our findings are generalizable to other ad-blockers using similar filter lists.

## 3. The Performance Cost of Ad-Blocking
Our analysis aims to identify how ad-blockers impact user QoE. We used WebPageTest (WPT), an open-source web performance diagnostic tool, to load a range of popular websites in a controlled environment with and without ABP enabled. WPT creates a sandbox with virtual machines, allowing testers to load websites under various conditions and providing performance metrics such as PLT and TTFP.

### 3.1 Methodology and Dataset
To analyze the impact of ad-blocking on QoE, we loaded the top 5,000 Alexa websites using a private instance of WPT on a dedicated virtual machine and a web server on Google Cloud Platform. We used the Chrome browser (version 57.0.2979.23) with Adblock Plus (version 1.12.4). After loading, we collected results using the WPT REST API and parsed HAR files with Haralyzer.

### 3.2 Ad-Blocking, Requested Objects, and Web QoE
We measured the reduction in the number of objects loaded with ad-blocking for the top 5,000 Alexa sites, focusing on JavaScript, images, and HTML objects, which are typically associated with ads.

#### Impact on Requested Objects
When websites are loaded with ABP enabled, we observed a 19% reduction in requested objects on average, and a 75% reduction for the 95th percentile. Table 1 shows the percentile numbers of requested objects with and without ad-blocking, along with the ad-block exposure rate, defined as the number of ads shown to ad-block users per ad shown to non-ad-block users.

| Percentile | Adblock | No Adblock | Ad-Block Exposure Rate |
|------------|---------|------------|------------------------|
| 10         |  |  |  |
| 30         |  |  |  |
| 50         |  |  |  |
| 70         |  |  |  |
| 90         |  |  |  |

In Figure 1, we focus on the difference in requests for various object types across the 90th percentile of websites, showing that images are the most frequently blocked type of objects.

## Conclusion
Our study provides the first detailed analysis of ad-blocking's impact on web QoE, revealing a complex relationship between ad-blocking and user experience. While ad-blocking generally improves PLT, it can significantly worsen TTFP, especially for the bottom 10th percentile. User preferences, as indicated by our crowd-sourced experiment, highlight the importance of first impressions, suggesting that faster initial rendering is more valued than faster full page loads.
