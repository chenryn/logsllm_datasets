## Abstract
The operational lifespan of mobile devices such as cell phones, navigation systems, and laptop computers is significantly influenced by the battery's lifetime. This lifetime is not only dependent on the rate of energy consumption but also on the usage pattern of the battery. Continuous high current draw results in a significant drop in residual capacity, while intervals of low or no current allow for partial recovery of the battery. We model this complex behavior using an inhomogeneous Markov reward model, based on the Kinetic Battery Model (KiBaM). The state-dependent reward rates correspond to the power consumption of the device and the available charge. We develop a tailored numerical algorithm to compute the distribution of consumed energy and demonstrate how different workload patterns affect the overall battery lifetime.

## 1. Introduction
With the proliferation of affordable wireless access technologies like wireless LAN, Bluetooth, and GSM, the number of wireless devices used by the average person has steadily increased over the past few years. These devices enhance our flexibility, reachability, and security. Additionally, there is a growing number of wireless devices used for surveillance, particularly in sensor networks. A common challenge in designing these devices is managing power consumption, as most rely on rechargeable batteries. Achieving low power consumption has become a key design issue, as evidenced by numerous recent publications and a special issue of IEEE Computer (November 2005) dedicated to this topic [1].

Low-power design is a broad field, with "battery-driven system design" being a specialized branch that is becoming increasingly important. A critical aspect is finding the right balance between battery usage and required performance. How can we design a (wireless) system to achieve good performance (throughput, reachability, etc.) for a sufficiently long period with a given battery? Recent observations show that the longest battery lifetime is not always achieved by simply minimizing power consumption at all times. Instead, the way power is consumed, including current-extraction patterns and current levels, plays a significant role in battery lifetime.

To better understand battery lifetimes, various models have been developed. In this paper, we focus on the Kinetic Battery Model (KiBaM). However, what has not been explored is the integration of such power consumption models with performance models for mobile communication systems, considering the physical aspects of battery operation. This is the issue we address in this paper.

Our approach involves describing the system's operation with an abstract workload model, which details the various states the wireless device can be in, along with the energy consumption rates in those states. The transition possibilities between these states are also represented in the workload model. This description can be interpreted as a Markov-reward model, where the accumulated reward represents the amount of energy consumed. The battery lifetime would then be the time until a certain level of consumption (the available charge) is reached. While well-known techniques for performability evaluation can determine this time, they do not fully account for the physical aspects of battery operation. Studies show that battery depletion is non-linear and depends on the remaining energy. Furthermore, during idle periods, subtle but important battery-restoration effects occur, effectively refilling the battery. Translating these effects into a Markov reward model context, the reward and transition rates may depend on time and/or the amount of accumulated reward, with both positive and negative reward rates possible.

In this paper, we use the analytical KiBaM as a starting point and combine it with performance models. We also present a tailored algorithm for evaluating battery lifetime distributions for the KiBaMRM (Kinetic Battery Markov Reward Model).

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the fundamental properties of batteries. Section 3 discusses battery models and describes the KiBaM in detail. Section 4 establishes notation for inhomogeneous Markov reward models and presents the Markov reward models for batteries used in the rest of the paper. Section 5 describes the algorithm for computing battery lifetime. Section 6 discusses the results obtained from the models, and Section 7 concludes the paper.

## 2. Batteries
The two primary properties of a battery are its voltage (measured in volts, V) and its capacity (typically measured in Ampere-hours, Ah). The product of these two quantities gives the energy stored in the battery. For an ideal battery, the voltage remains constant until the battery is completely discharged, at which point the voltage drops to zero. The capacity in the ideal case is the same for every load. In reality, however, the voltage drops during discharge, and the effective capacity is lower under higher loads.

For an ideal battery, calculating the lifetime is straightforward. The lifetime \( L \) under a constant load is given by the capacity \( C \) divided by the load current \( I \) (in Amperes), \( L = \frac{C}{I} \). However, due to various nonlinear effects, this relation does not hold for real batteries. A simple approximation for the lifetime under constant load can be made using Peukert’s law [2]:
\[ L = \frac{a}{I^b}, \]
where \( a > 0 \) and \( b > 1 \) are constants that depend on the battery. This relation does not apply to variable loads. According to Peukert’s law, all load profiles with the same average would have the same lifetime. Experimentally, this is not the case, and one of the significant effects is the battery's recovery effect.

All batteries operate through electrochemical reactions. During discharge, an oxidation reaction occurs at the anode, producing electrons that are released into the circuit. At the cathode, a reduction reaction takes place, where electrons are accepted from the circuit and consumed:
\[ \text{O}_1 + ne^- \rightarrow \text{R}_1, \]
\[ \text{R}_2 \rightarrow \text{O}_2 + me^-. \]

For example, in lithium-ion batteries, the reactions are:
\[ \text{Li}_{1-x}\text{CoO}_2 + x\text{Li}^+ + xe^- \rightarrow \text{LiCoO}_2, \]
\[ \text{C}\text{Li}_x \rightarrow \text{C} + x\text{Li}^+ + xe^-. \]

These are the reactions for discharging the battery. For charging, the arrows in the reaction equations are reversed.

In a lithium-ion battery, the Li+ ions produced at the anode must diffuse to the cathode when a current is drawn. If the current is too high, the internal diffusion cannot keep up with the reaction rate at the cathode, causing a drop in output voltage. However, during idle periods, the ions have time to diffuse, leading to charge recovery.

Another effect at high currents is that no reaction sites (molecules) are available at the cathode. At low currents, the reaction sites are uniformly distributed, but at high currents, the reduction occurs only at the surface of the cathode, making internal reaction sites unreachable and reducing the effective capacity.

## 3. Battery Models
To understand these physical processes, various battery models have been proposed. The simplest models are purely analytical, similar to Peukert’s law. More detailed models, such as equivalent electrical circuit models, can be evaluated using simulation packages like Spice [4]. Even more detailed electrochemical models can predict battery lifetime accurately but are often too complex for high-level system models [5]. Recently, stochastic models have been proposed, where the battery charge is discretized, and probabilistic transitions between charge levels account for the observed effects [6]. These Markovian models have also been used to study the effect of workload variations [7].

The Kinetic Battery Model (KiBaM) [8] is an intuitive analytical model based on chemical kinetics. The battery charge is distributed between two wells: the available-charge well and the bound-charge well (Figure 1). The available-charge well supplies electrons directly to the load, while the bound-charge well supplies electrons to the available-charge well. The rate of charge flow between the wells depends on the difference in heights of the two wells and a parameter \( k \). The parameter \( c \) gives the fraction of the total charge in the available-charge well. The change in charge in both wells is described by the following system of differential equations:
\[ \frac{dy_1}{dt} = -I + k(h_2 - h_1), \]
\[ \frac{dy_2}{dt} = -k(h_2 - h_1), \]
with initial conditions \( y_1(0) = c \cdot C \) and \( y_2(0) = (1 - c) \cdot C \), where \( C \) is the total battery capacity. The heights \( h_1 \) and \( h_2 \) are given by \( h_1 = \frac{y_1}{c} \) and \( h_2 = \frac{y_2}{1 - c} \). When a load \( I \) is applied, the available charge decreases, and the difference in heights between the wells increases. During idle periods, charge flows from the bound-charge well to the available-charge well, increasing the available charge and extending the battery's lifetime compared to continuous load.

If \( c = 1 \), all charge is readily available, and the system reduces to a single equation:
\[ \frac{dy_1}{dt} = -I, \]
because \( y_2 = 0 \) at any time.

The system of differential equations can be solved analytically for a constant load current \( I \). This solution can be used to calculate the battery lifetime for any given workload with piecewise constant currents. We calculated the battery lifetime for simple workloads consisting of a square wave with a fixed frequency. Figure 2 shows the charges in the available-charge and bound-charge wells as a function of time for a workload with a frequency of \( f = 0.001 \) Hz. The current drawn during the on periods was set to 0.96 A. The charge in the available-charge well decreases when the current is drawn and rises again during idle periods. The flow of charge from the bound-charge well starts slowly and accelerates over time due to the increasing height difference \( h_2 - h_1 \).

To perform these calculations, the parameters \( c \) and \( k \) must be determined. The parameter \( c \) can be calculated from the capacity delivered under very large and very small loads. At very large loads, the battery lifetime is short, and there is no time for charge to move from the bound-charge well to the available-charge well. The capacity delivered equals the amount of charge in the available-charge well. At very small loads, all the charge from both wells is delivered. The quotient of these two numbers is exactly \( c \); from [9], we take \( c = 0.625 \). The parameter \( k \) is set such that the model accurately predicts the battery lifetime.
