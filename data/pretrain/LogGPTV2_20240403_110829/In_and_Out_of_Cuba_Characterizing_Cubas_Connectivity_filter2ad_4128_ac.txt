each Namehelp user in our dataset. We found that all
traceroutes launched by this probe and targeting the IPs
of Namehelp users would leave the country via either Tata’s
and Telefonica’s network, avoiding the high-latency satellite
connections.
However, the reverse path (going into Cuba) was not
as consistent.
For each traceroute measurement from
Namehelp, we identiﬁed the last AS hop that appeared
before entering the Cuban IXP network (AS11960). We then
calculated the approximate distance between the Namehelp
user and the Atlas node using MaxMind’s GeoIP database to
map users’ IP addresses to geographic locations. Finally, we
grouped measurements according to the last AS seen before
entering Cuba.
Figure 5 shows the relationship between RTT and dis-
tance, grouped by the last AS before entering Cuba. The
gray dotted line represents the RTT of light moving through
a cable of length x (assuming that light is moving through
the medium at c/2). The green dashed line represents the
linear regression between distance and latency for each group
of vantage points. Below each ﬁgure, we also include the
equation of the linear regression. We ﬁnd that the slope of
the linear regression of measurements that travel through
satellite networks is similar to that of the measurements
traversing the submarine cable, but is approximately 180 ms
higher.
Despite the fact that approximately 40% of the Earth’s
surface should be able to communicate directly with satel-
lites in geostationary orbit, we were unable to ﬁnd any
satellite base stations outside of North America in either of
the satellite networks. As a result, packets headed to Cuba
had to ﬁrst be routed to North America and then to Cuba
over a satellite connection.
For example, packets originating in Europe had to ﬁrst
traverse an intercontinental submarine cable before travers-
ing a satellite link, even though some countries should be
within the satellite’s serviceable area. The slopes of the
linear regression lines are thus roughly consistent across each
group of users, and similar to the slope of the estimated
speed of light through a ﬁber cable. The diﬀerence in the y-
intercept of the regression lines in Figs. 5a and 5b when

by users in each country.
compared to Figs. 5c and 5d is a result of traversing a
satellite link.
We also looked for trends between the origin of the
traceroute measurement and which network was used to
reach Cuba. We found that RTT could vary widely between
countries, even those in the same region, due to diﬀerences in
routing. In some cases, vantage points that were in countries
much further away from Cuba (e.g., in Europe) would have
signiﬁcantly lower RTTs than those in North and South
America.
Figure 6 shows the CDF of RTTs for users in France,
Spain, the US, the UK, and Venezuela. Latency measure-
ments from Namehelp users in France and Spain had the
lowest median latencies of all subpopulations in our dataset,
nearly half that of the median latency of users in the UK.
Despite the fact that users in the US and Venezuela are
much closer to Cuba, their RTTs were much higher. This
diﬀerence is due to the fact that most users in France
and Spain are routed to Cuba through Telefonica’s transit
network, and were sent via the ALBA-1 submarine cable

In total, 77% of routes to Cuba
from France and 94% of routes from Spain were routed over
the ALBA-1 submarine cable in both directions.
In contrast to previously reported networking perfor-
mance issues in developing countries, such as Ghana [20]
and Zambia [21], Cuba presents an interesting case in that
at least part of the performance issues can be attributed to
asymmetric routing and could be addressed via changes to
routing policy.
6. NETWORK SERVICE AVAILABILITY
We also survey a number of popular network services
and websites, checking their availability in Cuba. To test
website availability, we issued SSL certiﬁcate requests from
our set of 50 Atlas probes in North and South America to
4,434 domains supporting HTTPS from the top 10,000 most
popular websites.2 While we would have liked to test the
availability of any website, the RIPE Atlas API does not
support general HTTP tests. For every site, if the request
succeeded (replied with a valid certiﬁcate), we removed it
from our list. If the request failed, we tried four more times
before labeling the site as “unavailable”. The experiment
ran between August 31st and September 4th, 2015.
We found that, while most of the sites replied with a
valid certiﬁcate, requests from the Atlas probe in Cuba
timed out consistently across all ﬁve tests for 111 (2.5%)
of sites. Nearly every other Atlas probe was able to
successfully retrieve a valid SSL certiﬁcate from these
domains. Most of the “unavailable” websites in Cuba fall into
a few categories, such as ﬁnance-related (e.g., paypal.com,
bankofamerica.com, capitalone.com, and usbank.com), ad
network (e.g., adcash.com, adnetworkperformance.com, and
tradeadexchange.com), computer hardware (e.g., dell.com
and seagate.com), and adult content. A few of these
sites were registered by the same entity but provided
diﬀerent services or diﬀerent TLDs (e.g., capitalone.com
and capitaloneinvesting.com, blizzard.com and battle.net,
and the multiple TLDs of cam4.com), hinting at a parent
company policy. Table 2 list the percentage of websites per
category, along with a few examples.
We also found that many of the same sites we labeled
as unavailable in Cuba also timed out when requested from
Atlas probes in other US-sanctioned countries. Speciﬁcally,
51 of the 111 (46%) domains timed out when requests
originated from a probe in Sudan.
Beyond websites, we surveyed the availability of public
DNS services in Cuba and found all of those tested to be
reachable. A ﬁrst analysis showed as if some services were
unavailable; however, the result was due to the Recursion
Desired (RD) ﬂag of the request being unset by default in the
Atlas probe while many of the DNS servers are conﬁgured
to ignore requests with RD unset or respond with an empty
answer. We diagnosed the issue by comparing our results
with those of dig, which sets RD by default.
7. CONCLUSION
We have started to characterize the state of Cuba’s access
to the wider Internet. Our work is motivated by recent
improvements in connectivity to the island and the growing
commercial
interest following the ease of restrictions on
travel and trade with the US. This paper reports on some
2As ranked by Alexa alexa.com
of our early ﬁndings,
including high RTTs to websites
hosted oﬀ the island, even after the addition of ALBA-
1, a high degree of path asymmetry in traﬃc to/from the
island that partially traverse high-latency satellite links, and
several web services that return invalid responses to requests
originating from the island. We plan to make a periodic
status report on the state of the Internet in Cuba and the
associated data available to the research community.
