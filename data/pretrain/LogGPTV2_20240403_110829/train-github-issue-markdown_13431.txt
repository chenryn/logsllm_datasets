Okay, at risk of looking like a fool, I thought I would turn here for help.
Using the versions of several popular javascript libraries below, I am
attempting to run some basic tests to see if atom-shell would be useful to me.
Versions  
atom-shell: 0.12.3  
angularjs: 1.3.0  
bootstrap: 3.1.1  
d3js: 3.4.6  
jquery: 2.1.1
The problem is that I'm receiving two javascript errors and the page isn't
loading. The javascript errors are:
  * Uncaught Error: Bootstrap's JavaScript requires jQuery
  * Uncaught ReferenceError: d3 is not defined
I have the javascript files organized in to a "lib" directory under my app
directory in resources, see index.html in the gist below for details. I assume
you can download the relevant versions above and recreate the structure
without my having to include these very common libs in the gist.
I'm attempting to recreate the following d3.js example:

And here is the gist: https://gist.github.com/johningle/32d66f9751ebb9ec6f6a
Is anyone else experiencing this issue or am I just being a noob?
