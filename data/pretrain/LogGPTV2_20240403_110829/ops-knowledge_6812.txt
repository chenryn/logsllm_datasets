User:  How to use caching technology in the application to improve system performance? Please list common caching techniques and practices.
Assistant: Caching technology is a technology that speeds up the performance of applications by storing temporary data. The following are commonly used caching technologies and practical methods: 1. CDN caching: Placing static resources on CDN can greatly reduce the load on the server and reduce the response time of user requests. 2. Local cache: For frequently requested data, cache it in the local browser to reduce interaction with the server. Common local cache technologies include localStorage and sessionStorage. 3. Distributed cache: Caching data on multiple servers can improve the scalability and performance of the system. 4. Database cache: Putting the cached data in the memory database can greatly speed up the efficiency of reading and writing data. 5. Memory cache: Put frequently used data in the memory for caching, which can improve the read and write speed. 6. Lazy loading: Loading part of the content of the page on demand can reduce the loading time of the page and the occupation of bandwidth. 7. Page fragment caching: Caching frequently used page fragments can greatly improve page loading speed and user experience. 8. Cache preheating: When the application starts, frequently used data is preloaded into the cache to improve data access efficiency.
