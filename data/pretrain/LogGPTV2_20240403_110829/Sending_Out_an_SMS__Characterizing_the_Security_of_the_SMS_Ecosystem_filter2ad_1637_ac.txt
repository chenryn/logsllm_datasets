### Carrier Type Distribution

| Carrier Type | Amount | Percent of Total |
|-------------|--------|------------------|
| Mobile      | 261    | 62.0%            |
| VoIP        | 149    | 35.4%            |
| Landline    | 11     | 2.6%             |

**Table III: Carrier Type Analysis**

Using Twilio-provided data, we determined the carrier type for each sender and receiver number on the gateways. Some numbers were mislabeled as landlines by Twilio but are actually mobile numbers, as these carriers offer both mobile and landline services. Additionally, Twilio incorrectly labels numbers from Bandwidth.com as "mobile" numbers, despite Bandwidth.com being a VoIP provider. The figures in this paper have been corrected to reflect these inaccuracies.

### Geographical Distribution

Twilio's data includes geolocation information for each number, indicating that our dataset spans 28 countries. The United States has the highest number of gateway-controlled numbers, with 98 numbers receiving 95,138 messages. Conversely, Lithuania has the lowest, with only one gateway-controlled number. The Czech Republic has the fewest messages sent to its gateway-controlled numbers, with two numbers receiving just six messages. Interestingly, nine numbers are associated with providers servicing the Channel Islands, which have a total population of less than 170,000 people.

For the 153 numbers in the United States and Canada, we obtained Caller ID Name (CNAM) data. We found that 55.4% of these numbers have no CNAM data. For those with data, the official record is often "CONFIDENTIAL," "WIRELESS CALLER," or "Unavailable." The remaining numbers have CNAM data indicating they are located in 57 cities or 3 provinces (British Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec) in the United States or Canada. The top locations by message volume are Ontario, followed by Centennial, CO; San Francisco, CA; Little Rock, AR; Airdrie, AB; Columbia, SC; San Antonio, TX; Detroit, MI; Cleveland, OH; and Washington, MD. Notably, most numbers are not based in large population centers, with the exception of Centennial, CO, where Gateways 4 and 5 registered multiple numbers.

### Cluster Analysis

We generated 44,579 clusters from our dataset. All clusters with more than 43 messages were manually tagged and analyzed, resulting in 754 tagged clusters. These clusters represent the most popular services in our dataset and cover 286,963 messages (74.2% of the total). Figure 2 shows the exponential distribution of cluster sizes on a log-log scale.

### SMS Usage

As shown in Table IV, messages containing a code constitute the majority of our dataset (67.6%), indicating that verification and authentication are primary uses of SMS in our data. Account creation and mobile device binding codes are the largest subcategories, comprising 51.6% of the messages. One-time password (OTP) messages make up only 7.6% of the messages, and URL variations are rare, constituting just 2.6% of the messages. This suggests that most services prefer plain codes over URLs, which may not work well on older phones.

Password reset messages account for 1.3% of the dataset, with the corresponding URL version making up another 1.0%. These password reset URLs are predominantly from Facebook. A small portion (0.8%) consists of "test" messages, which are used to verify that the service is functioning correctly. Finally, a few messages contain partial or complete usernames and passwords, which can be particularly dangerous if intercepted.

### Security Implications of SMS

#### PII and Sensitive Information

SMS is widely used for distributing sensitive information, including financial data and login credentials. We found instances of credit card numbers, CVV2 codes, and other financial information being distributed via SMS. For example, Paytoo and iCashCard distribute virtual and prepaid credit card numbers over SMS, along with PINs and other sensitive details. Additionally, we discovered a message containing a Venezuelan bank's credit card number, possibly related to black market transactions.

Other sensitive information includes usernames and passwords. Services like Boss Revolution and Frim use phone numbers and passwords distributed via SMS, making accounts vulnerable to compromise if the SMS is intercepted. Other services, such as eCall.ch and RedOxygen, also distribute usernames and passwords via SMS.

Password reset information, particularly for Facebook and xCFD, is often sent via SMS with minimal additional authentication, allowing an adversary with access to the message to control the account. We also found numerous instances of personally identifiable information (PII), including addresses, zip codes, and email addresses, which can be used to associate accounts with specific devices.

#### SMS Code Entropy

Our dataset provided samples of codes sent by many services. We grouped these codes by service and extracted numeric codes from 33 clusters, totaling 35,942 authentication codes across 25 services. Using a chi-square test, we found that only 12 of 34 clusters (35%) had p-values > 0.05, indicating that most codes are not uniformly generated. The effect size for most tests was large (w > 0.5), confirming that the statistically significant differences are meaningful. Figure 3 presents heatmaps of codes from WeChat and Talk2, showing a lack of entropy, while Line generates more random codes.

### Conclusion

Our analysis highlights the widespread use of SMS for sensitive communications, including financial transactions and account management. However, the low entropy of many authentication codes and the presence of PII in SMS messages pose significant security risks. Organizations should consider more secure methods for transmitting sensitive information and improving the randomness of authentication codes.
