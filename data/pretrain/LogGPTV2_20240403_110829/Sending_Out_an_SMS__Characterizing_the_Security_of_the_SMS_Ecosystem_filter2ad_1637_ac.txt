TABLE III: Using Twilio-provided data, we obtained the
carrier type for each of the carriers associated with sender
and receiver numbers on the gateways.
mislabeled as landlines by Twilio and are actually mobile
numbers, due to all three being carriers that advertise both
mobile and landline service. Furthermore, Twilio indicates
numbers from bandwidth.com as “mobile” numbers (this
is not due to porting, as Twilio resolves porting scenarios).
bandwidth.com is actually a VoIP provider. The numbers
in this paper are corrected to reﬂect this.
3) Geography: Twilio’s number data also includes geolo-
cation information for each number which shows our data is
based in 28 countries. The United States has the most gateway
controlled numbers with 98 numbers seen receiving 95,138
messages, the most trafﬁc of any country. Conversely, Lithua-
nia only had one gateway-controlled number registered to it,
the lowest of the countries in our data. The Czech Republic has
the fewest messages sent to the gateway-controlled numbers
registered to a country, with two numbers receiving only six
messages. Interestingly, 9 of our numbers are associated with
providers who service the Channel Islands, located off the
coast of France with a total population of less than 170,000
people.
Twilio data provides only the country of origin, so for all
153 numbers in the United States and Canada we obtain caller
ID name (CNAM) data8. We found that the vast majority of
numbers (55.4%) have no CNAM data at all. Of those mes-
sages that have data, the ofﬁcial record in the CNAM database
is simply “CONFIDENTIAL,” “WIRELESS CALLER,” or
“Unavailable.” Note that “Unavailable” is the actual string that
would be displayed to a user, not an indication of no data in
the database.
The remainder of the messages are sent to phone numbers
that have CNAM data indicating the number is in one of 57
cities or 3 provinces (British Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec)
in the United States or Canada. By message volume, the top
locations are “Ontario”, followed by Centennial, CO (in the
Denver area); San Francisco, CA; Little Rock, AR; Airdrie,
AB; Columbia, SC; San Antonio, TX; Detroit, MI; Cleveland,
OH; and Washington, MD. There are several observations to
make from these ﬁndings: ﬁrst, numbers are selected to well
beyond what is likely the gateways’ main location. Second is
that neither gateways nor users feel a need to use numbers
based in large population centers. With the exception of
Centennial, CO, all
locations had four or fewer numbers,
regardless of population of the location. Gateways 4 and 5
registered the numbers in Centennial.
4) Clusters: We generated 44,579 clusters from our dataset.
All messages with more than 43 messages were manually

TABLE IV: We separated and labeled each cluster containing
a code the intent of the message. This table contains each of
those labels and the number of messages in each, which total
74.2% of the messages in our dataset.
tagged and analyzed giving us 754 tagged clusters. These
clusters represent the messages from the most popular services
in our dataset. The tagged clusters only represent 1.7% of the
total clusters but the tagged clusters cover 286,963 messages
(74.2%). Figure 2 represents the data that supports this as-
sertion by showing the exponential distribution of the cluster
sizes.
5) SMS Usage: As shown in Table IV, messages containing
a code constitute the majority of our dataset at 67.6% of the
total messages, enforcing that a main usage of SMS in our
data is veriﬁcation and authentication.9 Account creation and
mobile device binding codes are the largest subcategories
9As we note in the previous section, these percentages are reﬂective of
gateway messages, and may not necessarily be representative of broader SMS
trends.

with 51.6% of the messages. Compared to other messages con-
taining a code, one-time password messages are only 7.6% of
messages. The URL variations for these code messages are
also rare, constituting only 2.6% of messages. This reﬂects that
most services prefer to plain codes, instead of URLs, which
may not work well for older phones.
Password reset messages comprise 1.3% of our dataset. The
corresponding URL version takes another 1.0% of our dataset.
Interestingly, these password reset URLs overwhelmingly con-
sist of Facebook results.
A small part (0.8%) consists of “test” messages. These are
messages that consist of text such as “Test,” “Hello,” or “Hi”
with no other information. This category consists of large
clusters of messages sent by individuals to probe that the
service works as advertised and is currently working. The
sender phone numbers, therefore, provide insight into users of
the gateways. We explore this more fully later in Section VI.
Finally, a few messages contain partial or complete user-
names and passwords. These messages are particularly egre-
gious because they may lead to account compromise and/or
user identiﬁcation. We discuss this further below.
V. USES OF SMS AS A SECURE CHANNEL
In this section, we discuss what we observed about the
security implications if any of the components of the SMS
ecosystem described in Figure 1 are compromised. Although
the usage we discuss in this section is benign, we observe the
presence of PII and low code entropy, which are dangerous
when available to an adversary in this ecosystem.
A. PII and other Sensitive Information
SMS has become a major portion of global telecommu-
nications worldwide, and its use by companies and other
organizations comes as unsurprising. However, our dataset
contained instances of companies using SMS to distribute
payment credentials or other ﬁnancial information, login cre-
dentials, and other personally identiﬁable information. We also
see instances where gateways are used for sensitive services.
a) Financial information: We found several distinct in-
stances of credit card numbers being distributed over SMS in
our dataset. Two of these appear to be intentional methods
of distributing new cards, while another two appear to be the
result of commerce. We discovered these using PII regular
expressions. We also discovered several instances of CVV2
codes in our data. CVV2 codes are credit card codes meant
to verify that the user is in possession of the physical card at
the time of purchase.
We found that two services that provide “virtual” credit card
numbers to allow access to mobile wallet funds distribute the
numbers over SMS. These card numbers are “virtual” in the
sense that they are not backed by a credit line, but in fact seem
to be persistent. The ﬁrst service is Paytoo, based in the United
States. We recovered three distinct cards from this service,
and additional messages containing balance updates, account
numbers and transaction identiﬁers. While password reset was
handled over email, identiﬁers such as email, username, phone
number, or account number could all be used for login.
The other service is iCashCard, based in India. They
distribute a prepaid credit card account number over SMS;
this card is protected by a PIN also distributed over SMS.
Additional messages contained a separate PIN which allows
for account login with the phone number, meaning that access
to SMS reveals access to the entire payment credential and
account.
We found an additional credit card number, CVV, and
expiration value from an unnamed service whose identity or
purpose we could not identify. The message indicated that
it was being sent to a user who had purchased a “package”
of some sort, and conﬁrmed the purchase using the full credit
card number. Incidentally, the purchaser’s IP address was listed
in the SMS, and that IP address was placed in SANS blocklist
for suspected bots and forum spammers.
Our PII regular expressions discovered one ﬁnal credit card
number present in a text message sent to a Mexican phone
number. The message contains a reference to a Venezuelan
bank, the card holder’s name, and includes the credit card
number, the CVV2, and the expiration date. To determine
the context for this message, we examined other messages
from this sender and found what appeared to be an SMS-
based mailing list for purchasing items on the black market
in Venezuela;
items for sale included US paper products
(diapers, tissue), oil, and tires, as well as US dollars at non-
ofﬁcial rates [34]. Our best hypothesis for the presence of
the credit card is that a purchaser of an item mistakenly sent
payment information to the list in place of the actual sender.
Nevertheless, this highlights that highly sensitive enterprises
rely on SMS.
In addition to credit card information, we discovered one
unidentiﬁed Polish service that includes a CVV2 code in their
messages after registering for a prepaid service. Translated (by
Google), these messages read:
Thank you for registering on the
site prepaid. Your CVV2 code is: 194
The ﬁnancial information in our gateway data is not limited
to credit card numbers. We found several instances of mes-
sages sent by a prepaid credit card provider in Germany, Pay-
Center [13], that distributes bank account numbers (IBANs) in
SMS messages. The same provider also sends a veriﬁcation
text to the user with a URL that includes the user’s full name.
The messages above indicate that some services unwisely
transmit sensitive ﬁnancial information over SMS.
b) Usernames and Passwords: In scanning our labeled
clusters, we identiﬁed several services that would allow user
accounts to be compromised if SMS conﬁdentiality is lost. The
most prominent example of these is Canadian international
calling provider Boss Revolution [2]. Their user passwords
are distributed via SMS, and usernames are simply the user’s
phone number. Thus, an attacker with read access to these
messages can compromise an account. Another example was
the Frim messaging service [5]. That service also uses the

user’s phone number and a password distributed over SMS.
Other services distributing usernames and passwords in SMS
include eCall.ch (a Swiss VoIP provider) [4] and RedOxygen
(a bulk SMS provider) [17]. Fortunately for users, most online
services in our data do not distribute password information
through SMS.
c) Password Reset: Several organizations,
including
Facebook and the investment platform xCFD, distribute pass-
word reset information via SMS in addition to or in place
of other methods. The most common password request in our
data was for Facebook account resets. Upon investigating these
messages (using only our own accounts), we found that the
messages contained a URL that would allow a password reset
with no other identifying information or authentication — not
even a name or username. This would allow any adversary
with access to the message — either as it transits carrier
networks, the receiving device, or any other entity that handles
the message – to control the account. If the adversary has the
username, he/she could cause reset messages to be sent for that
account, allowing the adversary to take complete control of the
account. This highlights the consequences of a compromise of
the SMS ecosystem.
d) Other personally identiﬁable information: We found
numerous examples of PII — including addresses, zip codes,
and email addresses. Email addresses are worth noting because
the presence of an email address indicating an association
between a phone number an account could be used to associate
codes or other authenticators sent to that device to the partic-
ular account. Our PII regular expressions identiﬁed 522 mes-
sages with emails – most of these were sent by live.com,
gmail.com, inbox.ru, or pop.co (a hosting provider).
e) SMS Activity from Sensitive Applications: Finally, we
noticed several
instances where messages appeared in the
gateway from organizations whose very nature is sensitive.
The worst among these was the roomsharing service Airbnb.
One of our messages contained the full address of the shared
property (personal information obscured):
Airbnb reservation reminder:
Jan 25-28 @ .
:  or 
Although we suspect that the owner of the property listed
it in such a way that this data was revealed, the use of SMS
gateways for these services is troubling as it could facilitate
real-world abuses.
Other examples of sensitive applications include a large set
of registrations with other telecommunications services. These
include popular phone services like Telegram, Viber, Line,
Burner and Frim. The presence of these services in gateway
data may indicate the use of these gateways for “number
chaining,” a practice that allows PVA evaders to acquire a
large number of telephone numbers for free [73]. In addition,
we see registration and activity in the gateway data to a
number of bulk SMS services. This may indicate the use of
gateway numbers to obtain access to bulk SMS services for
the purposes of sending SPAM, in addition to a potential use
for number chaining.
f) Case Study: QIWI Wallet: We have identiﬁed one
service that uses most of the previously discussed problematic
SMS practices: QIWI wallet, a Russian mobile wallet operated
in partnership with VISA [23]. First, QIWI wallet sends email
addresses in messages to bind emails to accounts. Second,
this service also sends password reset codes over SMS, while
allowing login with the user’s phone number — meaning any
reader of the message can reset the user’s password. QIWI also
provides VISA numbers for its users, and they send partially-
blinded card numbers and full CVV2 numbers through SMS.
Such partially-blinded information can still be sensitive as
knowing the last four digits of a credit card is sometimes
used for over-the-phone authentication, and such information
has been used in the past to target call centers [45]. More
worrisome, they seem to use two different blinding schemes –
sometimes blocking the ﬁrst and last four digits, other times
blocking the middle 8 digits of the card. If both blinding
schemes are used for the same card, it would be possible
to acquire all card information over SMS. This service also
sends balance updates over SMS, which are also sometimes
used for caller authentication. Finally, we found at least one
message in our data corresponding to a QIWI blocked account
notiﬁcation; one possible reason for this is the use of the QIWI
account (registered with the gateway number) for fraud or
abuse.
B. SMS code Entropy
Our message dataset afforded us samples of codes sent
by many services over SMS. These codes provide valuable
phone veriﬁcation capabilities to services that wish to increase
the burden of obtaining an account (e.g., to prevent fraudulent
account creation), and these codes provide a glimpse into
the security of the code-generation schemes. We grouped
those clusters containing codes by service and extracted the
numeric code from each message. Overall, we extracted from
33 clusters containing 35,942 authentication codes across 25
services, as shown in Table V.
We ﬁrst tested the entropy of each set of codes using a chi-
square test. The chi-square test is a null hypothesis signiﬁcance
test, and in our use case indicates if the codes are uniformly
generated between the lowest and highest value. The p-value
less than 0.01 means that there is a statistically signiﬁcant
difference between the observed data and an ideal uniform
distribution. Only 12 of 34 clusters (35%) had p-values > 0.05.
We also measure the effect size for each test, ﬁnding that
most effect sizes were large (w > 0.5) with only one medium
(w > 0.3), indicating our statistically signiﬁcant differences
were in fact meaningful. Finally, we conﬁrmed that all tests
performed had a statistical power of 0.98 or higher, indicating
that our test had a high likelihood of observing any effect
present.
Of the clusters, those belonging to the WeChat and Talk2
services had the least entropy of the authentication codes we
analyzed. Not only did both services have p-values of 0.0 in
