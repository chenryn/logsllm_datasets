User: I just downloaded and installed Python 2.7.2 to my laptop and I am trying to run some sample programs. My laptop is running Windows XP.
When I open a cmd window and type python I get:

'python' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.

I am not a Windows person (mostly mainframes). However I am guessing that there is some command that I need to execute to define python as a command. Can anyone tell me what that command is?
The installer placed Python at C:\Python27\.
Assistant: Easy. Won't need to get confused but paths and variables and what to click. Just follow my steps:
Go to the python installer.
Run it.
Out of the 3 options choose modify.
Check py launcher.
Next.
Check "Add python to environment variables"
Install.
Restart the cmd when finished and boom done
