### 5.6 Password Decoding

In this section, we examine the effectiveness of an eavesdropper using an exhaustive search to detect an n-character password. A brute-force attack on the entire password space would require approximately \(26^n \approx 2^{4.7n}\) trials. To reduce computational complexity and speed up the attack, we introduce the Best Guesses Search (BGS), which is particularly useful when limited-time access is available to a device requiring password authentication. We also provide the success probabilities of finding the correct password when the attacker is allowed up to three trials, a common scenario.

For the BGS, we select the five closest keys for each character, reducing the number of tests to:
\[ N(n) = 5^n \approx 2^{2.3n} \]

The probability of detecting the full password is given by:
\[ P_{\text{PasswordDetection}}(n) = (P_{\text{char5}})^n \]
where \(P_{\text{char5}}\) is the probability that a character matches one of the five guesses.

Overall, this approach reduces the entropy of the password by a factor of about 2 (from 4.7 to 2.3).

We compare the accuracies of cross-correlation and time-frequency classification techniques for detecting n-character passwords using the BGS and when performing a small number of trials. For 6-character passwords (which include \(5^6 = 15625\) trials), we verify that the detection probability matches our calculations using Equation 3.

All detection rates are summarized in Table 5. The detection rates for 1 to 3 trials are derived from the best matching single character listed in Tables 3, 4, and 6. We emphasize that even when the passwords are typed with touch typing and the training uses hunt and peck data, the performance is still significantly better than a brute force attack, which would produce an average success rate of 0.005% for our search space.

Finally, we use the probabilities from Table 4 to calculate the password search space size (as per Equation 2) and the average detection probabilities (as per Equation 3) for the BGS. Results for passwords of length up to 12 characters are shown in Figures 2 and 3 of the appendix. These figures demonstrate that the BGS significantly reduces the search space size and improves the detection probability for passwords of different lengths.

### 6. Discussion

Our research highlights that keyboard acoustic eavesdropping attacks are influenced by detection technique, typing style, and type of input data, providing insights into their impact.

#### 6.1 Detection Technique

We explored several techniques, including Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), time-based correlation, and frequency features. Our findings indicate that the signals do not "stretch" significantly in time, leading to poorer performance of DTW compared to other techniques. We observed that the similarities in signals emanated from the same key are detectable in both the frequency and time domains. We present a new technique that combines this information, achieving improved detection results based on both time and frequency data.

#### 6.2 Typing Style

Our work demonstrates that while the underlying plate contributes to the key sound, the typing style also plays a significant role. Although there are sound differences between some keys, distinguishing between all alphabet keys becomes challenging. Our experiments show that the accuracy of detecting a single character on the keyboard decreases when moving from hunt and peck typing to touch typing (Tables 3, 4, and 6). Therefore, users who employ touch typing are less susceptible to keyboard acoustic eavesdropping. Since many users in real-life scenarios use touch typing, keyboard acoustic attacks may not be as significant a threat as previously believed.

#### 6.3 Type of Input Data

Our research indicates that detecting random passwords poses a significant challenge because only the raw audio signal is available as input. In contrast, attacks on English text or weak passwords may achieve better results due to the underlying language model and dictionary tools, as demonstrated by prior research [21, 22, 4]. This means that random passwords are less vulnerable to keyboard eavesdropping attacks.

We conclude that users who employ random passwords are less susceptible to keyboard acoustic attacks than those who use weak passwords. However, our attacks on random passwords are still orders of magnitude more successful than random guessing or brute-forcing attempts (as depicted in Table 5). For example, with only 3 trials, for touch-typed passwords, our attacks are better by a factor of about 150,000; with 16,457 trials, they are better by a factor of about 2,000.

### 7. Other Related Work

Acoustic emanations have been utilized for eavesdropping on dot matrix printers. Briol [5] showed that significant information can be extracted about printed text using acoustic emanations to distinguish between the letters 'W' and 'J'. Backes et al. [2] presented an attack that recovers English printed text from printer audio sounds.

In a proof-of-concept work [12], Shamir and Tromer explored inferring CPU activities associated with RSA decryption via acoustic emanations to learn the RSA private keys. Halevi and Saxena [7] studied acoustic emanations to learn key exchange information during wireless device pairing.

Other methods to extract keyboard input focus on sources other than audio. Balzaroni et al. [3] explored recovering keyboard input based on video of the typing session. Song et al. [15] showed that timing information of key-presses can be used to exploit weaknesses in the SSH protocol. Marquardt et al. [23] used accelerometer data from modern mobile phones (iPhone 4) to implement keyboard dictionary attacks.

### 8. Conclusions and Future Work

In this paper, we re-examined the vulnerability of keyboard typing to audio emanations. Our work shows that keyboard eavesdropping is influenced by typing style, input data, and detection technique. While the detection performance is reduced for realistic typing styles, keyboard typing remains vulnerable to eavesdropping attacks.

Our work provides an objective measure for the performance of key detection, which can be used to improve future language and dictionary-based attacks and assess the contribution of the language model to the final detection results. Overall, we found that the strength of acoustic eavesdropping attacks is limited when using different typing styles and random passwords, and may therefore not be as significant a threat as previously believed under realistic and security-sensitive settings.

We define a Best Guesses Search, which reduces the entropy of typed random passwords by half, significantly speeding up the exhaustive search. Future work could extend this to include numbers (e.g., numeric PINs or credit card numbers) and explore the combination of the Shift key with other characters, as an overlap in acoustic emanations may make it harder to detect the pressed keys.

Testing laptop keyboard acoustic emanations is another interesting direction. Preliminary tests show that the press signal is evident in laptop keyboard recordings, but the release audio signal is either very low in volume or not noticeable. Therefore, laptop keyboard eavesdropping needs to rely only on the key press and is likely to be less successful than traditional keyboard eavesdropping.
