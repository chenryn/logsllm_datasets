when the user types his password (testing phase), the attacker uses
the previous recordings he has as training data to decode the char-
acters typed.
To perform this test, we ﬁrst type each letter continuously and
record the audio signal, using touch typing. We use the typed
signals to create the training data. We then compare using both
the cross-correlation and the time-frequency method to decode the
password data based on the recorded training data.
Our tests show that as expected, the password decoding has sig-
niﬁcantly improved in this case (compared to training with hunt
and peck style data). We summarize the results in Table 3.
5.6 Password Decoding
Next, we look at the advantage that an eavesdropper can achieve
by using an exhaustive search to detect an n-character password
(i.e., by making use of a certain number of trials). While a brute-
force attack on the entire password space would take 26n ≃ 24:7(cid:2)n
trials, we introduce the Best Guesses Search, which reduces signif-
icantly the computing complexity and speeds-up the attack. There-
fore, it can be used when limited-time access is available to a device
that requires password authentication. We also provide the success
probabilities of ﬁnding the correct password when the attacker is
only allowed up to three trials (a common scenario).
For the Best Guesses Search, we chose for each character the
closest ﬁve keys. We therefore reduce the number of tests to:
N (n) = 5n ≃ 22:3(cid:2)n
This yields a probability of detecting the full password to:
P rP asswordDetection(n) = (Pchar5)n
Pchar5 is the probability that a char matches one of the ﬁve
guesses.
(2)
(3)
Overall, this means that our attack can cut down the entropy of
the password by a factor of about 2 (from 4.7 to 2.3).
We compare the accuracies of the cross-correlation and time-
frequency classiﬁcation techniques for detecting n − character
passwords for the Best Guesses Search as well as when performing
a small number of trials. We test the Best Guesses Search detec-
tion probability for 6-character passwords (which includes 56 =
15625 trials) and verify that it indeed matches our calculations us-
ing Equation 3.
All of the detection rates are summarized in Table 5. The detec-
tion rates, for the case involving 1 to 3 trials are obtained directly
from the detection rates corresponding to the best matching single
character listed in Tables 3, 4 and 6. We emphasize that for the Best
Guesses Search, even when the passwords are typed with touch typ-
ing and the training uses hunt & peck typed data, the performance
is still considerably better than a brute force attack (which would
produce on average 0:005% success rate for the size of our search
space).
Finally, we use the probabilities from Table 4 to calculate the
password search space size (as per Equation 2) and the average
detection probabilities (as per Equation 3) for the Best Guesses
Search. We show results for passwords of length up to 12 char-
acters in Figures 2 and 3 of the appendix. We see that the Best
Guesses Search signiﬁcantly reduces the search space size and im-
proves the detection probability for passwords of different length.
6. DISCUSSION
Our research establishes that keyboard acoustic eavesdropping
attacks are affected by detection technique, typing style, and type
of input data and provides insights about their impact.
6.1 Detection Technique
We explored several techniques, including DTW, time-based cor-
relation and frequency features. Our work shows that the signals
do not “stretch” signiﬁcantly in time which results in the poorer
performance of the DTW technique relative to other techniques.
We observe that the similarities in signals emanated from the same
key are detectable both in the frequency and in the time domain.
We present a new technique which combines this information and
achieves improved detection results based on both time and fre-
quency data.
6.2 Typing Style
Our work demonstrates that while the underlying plate contributes
to the key sound, the typing style also contributes to it signiﬁcantly.
One of our observations is that while there are still sound differ-
ences between some of the keys (which conﬁrms our perception
that some keys sound “different”), when examining all the alpha-
bet keys in the keyboards, it becomes hard to distinguish between
a single key and all the other alphabet keys.
We found, from our experiments, that the accuracy of detecting
a single character on the keyboard is reduced when moving from
hunt and peck typing to touch typing (Tables 3, 4 and 6). There-
fore, users who employ touch typing are less prone to keyboard
acoustic eavesdropping. Since in real-life many users touch type,
in practice, keyboard acoustic attacks may not constitute to be as
signiﬁcant a threat as believed to be.
6.3 Type of Input Data
Our research shows that detection of random password poses a
signiﬁcant challenge, since only the (raw) audio signal is available
as input to the attack. On the other hand, attacks on English-text or
weak passwords may achieve better results due to the underlying
language model and the dictionary tools, as demonstrated by prior
research [21, 22, 4]. This means that random passwords are less
vulnerable to keyboard eavesdropping attacks.
We can conclude that users who employ random passwords are
less susceptible to keyboard acoustic attacks than those who em-
ploy weak passwords. On the other hand, our attacks on random
passwords are still orders of magnitude more successful than ran-
dom guessing or brute-forcing attempts (as depicted in Table 5).
For example, with only 3 trials, for touch typed passwords, our at-
tacks are better by a factor of about 150,000; with 16,457 trials,
they are better by a factor of about 2,000.
7. OTHER RELATED WORK
Acoustic emanations were also utilized for eavesdropping on dot
matrix printers. In [5], Briol showed that signiﬁcant information
can be extracted about the printed text, using acoustic emanations
to distinguish between the letters ‘W’ and ‘J’. In [2], Backes et al.
presented an attack which recovers English printed text from the
printer audio sounds.
In a proof-of-concept work published on the web [12], Shamir
and Tromer explore inferring of CPU activities associated with RSA
decryption via acoustic emanations to learn the RSA private keys.
In [7], Halevi and Saxena studied acoustic emanations in order to
learn key exchange information during the wireless device pairing
operation.
Additional methods to extract keyboard input focus on other sources
of information (i.e., other than audio). In [3], Balzaroni et al. ex-
plored recovering keyboard input based on video of the typing ses-
sion. In [15], Song et al. showed that timing information of key-
presses can be used to exploit weaknesses in SSH protocol.
In
[23], accelerometer data from modern mobile phones (iPhone 4)
was used to implement keyboard dictionary attacks.
8. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, we took a fresh look at the vulnerability of key-
board typing to audio emanations. Our work shows that keyboard
eavesdropping is affected by a few variables: typing style, input
data and detection technique. We show that while the detection
performance is reduced for realistic typing styles, keyboard typing
still remains vulnerable to eavesdropping attacks.
Our work further provides an objective measure for the perfor-
mance of key detection. This can be used as a basis for improving
future language and dictionary based attacks (whose success relies
on the underlying raw key detection capability) as well as assessing
the contribution of the language model to the ﬁnal detection results.
Overall, we found that the strength of acoustic eavesdropping
attacks is limited when using different typing styles and random
passwords, and may therefore not be as signiﬁcant a threat as previ-
ously believed to be under such realistic and security-sensitive set-
tings. On the other hand, we deﬁne a Best Guesses Search, which
reduces by half the entropy of the typed random passwords and
therefore considerably speeds-up the exhaustive search.
This work can be extended to also include numbers (e.g., nu-
meric PINs or credit card numbers). Since all the keys are posi-
tioned on the keyboard in a similar way and share the same un-
derlying physical plate, we expect the detection behavior to be the
same. However, it would be interesting to verify this in the future
work. Also, looking at the combination of the Shift key with other
characters is interesting since an overlap is expected between the
acoustic emanations of the keys which may make it harder to de-
tect the pressed keys.
Testing laptop keyboard acoustic emanations is another interest-
ing further step. We conducted preliminary tests and noticed that
the press signal is evident in laptop keyboard recordings. However,
the release audio signal either had very low volume or was not no-
ticeable at all in the recorded signal. Therefore, laptop keyboard
eavesdropping needs to rely only on the key press and is likely to
be less successful than traditional keyboard eavesdropping.
