### New Features:
* **Subscription Security:**
  * **SS-Health:**
    * We now check for the configuration of ARM policy, resource locks, and alerts in the subscription according to ISRM expectations. (The ability to provision these already existed.)
  * **JEA Server Lockdown:**
    * The work to combine Windows Server 2016 Security Baseline templates and Code Integrity policy into a single image has been completed.
  * **SS-ARM Policy:**
    * ARM policy provisioning now supports policies deployed for ExpressRoute-connected virtual networks.

* **Dev/CICD Kit:**
  * **SVTs:**
    * **Virtual Network Security:** Enhanced the SVT for ExpressRoute-connected vNets with additional checks for supporting infrastructure (e.g., presence of resource locks, ARM policies, alerts, etc.). The ER-Network SVT now covers both corpnet and DMZ scenarios and checks for the possible presence of multiple ER-connected vNets in the corresponding resource groups.
    * **Key Vault:** Added core controls for checking Azure Key Vault instances.
    * **Logic App Connectors:** Added controls for multiple commonly used Logic App Connectors to the Logic Apps SVT.
  * **Security IntelliSense:**
    * Added rules for traditional web application security issues (OWASP Top 10 category). Previously, SecIntel primarily covered native Azure (PaaS API) and Crypto rules.

* **Continuous Compliance:**
  * **Alerting & Monitoring:**
    * **OMS:** Completed the PoC to run SVTs in an Automation Runbook and push the results into OMS. We already have SVTs running in VSO Build/Release steps. This gives us the core technical components needed for a complete OMS-based solution (target for the next sprint!).
  * **Common/Framework Components:**
    * **New Names for Functions:**
      * Introduced easier-to-follow and naturally named 'aliases' for several current functions. These names are also compliant with PowerShell naming standards. For example, `Install-AzureRmISRMAlertsPkg` is now aliased to `Set-AzSDKAlerts`. This prepares us for a name change in the upcoming sprint release.
    * **Central View of Control Coverage (PoC):**
      * Note: Controls checked by various modules (including the new ones added in this release) of the DevOps Kit are displayed on GitHub. This is a "live" feed because the same rules are used by the DevOps kit scripts at runtime.

### Feature Improvements/Fixes:
* **Subscription Security:**
  * **SS-AlertsConfig:**
    * Added prioritization support for Azure Insights-based alerts. Only 'high' and 'critical' priority alerts are registered for email alerts, which should reduce the number of alert emails generated from the setup.

* **Dev/CICD Kit:**
  * No changes in this release.

* **Common/Framework Components:**
  * **Control JSON Design:**
    * ControlIDs have been renamed with more intuitive names. For example, `AzureStorage102` is now `Azure_Storage_AuthZ_Use_SAS_for_Blob`. Expanded the values for control evaluation status to cover a broader range of outcomes.
  * **Telemetry:**
    * Enhanced the telemetry dashboard to cover all the Pri-1 scenarios targeted for H1. Please give it a try [here](#) and let us know your thoughts!
