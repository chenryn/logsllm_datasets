**ATT&CK ID:** T0888  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Remote System Information Discovery

An adversary may attempt to gather detailed information about remote systems and their peripherals, including the make and model, role, and configuration. This information can be used to inform and shape subsequent actions. For example, knowing the operational role and model of a system can help the adversary determine whether it is a relevant target for their objectives. Additionally, understanding the system's configuration can guide the selection and execution of further techniques.
