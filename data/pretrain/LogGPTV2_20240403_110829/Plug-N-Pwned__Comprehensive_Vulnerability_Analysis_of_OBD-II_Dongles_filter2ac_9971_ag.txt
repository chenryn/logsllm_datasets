**8.1. Attacks and Defenses on the CAN Bus**

The Controller Area Network (CAN) bus, a core component of modern automobiles, has long been a target for security research due to its design-level vulnerabilities. As a broadcast protocol, the CAN bus lacks authentication mechanisms, making it susceptible to spoofed messages that can lead to unauthorized external access [36]. Common attacks involve injecting malicious CAN bus messages through the On-Board Diagnostics (OBD-II) port, which directly connects to the internal CAN bus. These attacks can significantly impact vehicle behavior, as demonstrated in real-world scenarios involving vehicles such as the Chevy Impala, Ford Escape, and Toyota Prius [10, 13, 19, 44, 45]. Injection attacks can have severe consequences, including engine shutdown and sudden braking, posing serious safety concerns.

In addition to the OBD-II port, researchers have explored other attack surfaces in modern vehicles, such as the In-Vehicle Infotainment (IVI) system, radio systems, sensors, LiDAR, and connected vehicle devices [44, 46–53]. The IVI system, in particular, has become a significant target due to its direct access to the CAN bus. For example, Mazloom et al. identified security holes in the MirrorLink protocol within an IVI system, allowing the injection of malicious messages into the CAN bus [54]. Mandal et al. conducted static program analysis on IVI Android apps and revealed numerous vulnerabilities, including poor access control [55]. Miller et al. uncovered a software vulnerability in the Uconnect system of a Jeep Cherokee, enabling remote attacks via cellular networks [44].

While prior research has exposed novel vulnerabilities and demonstrated various attacks, many of these efforts are ad-hoc, and the vulnerability analysis is not comprehensive. Additionally, most attacks require direct physical access to the vehicle [13, 19], limiting their practicality. In contrast, our work provides a comprehensive vulnerability study of a large number of OBD-II dongles on the market, revealing vulnerabilities that can lead to wireless attacks on nearby vehicles.

**8.2. Defenses Against CAN Bus Attacks**

To counteract attacks on the CAN bus, several defensive measures have been proposed. Directly injecting harmful CAN bus messages is challenging due to the complex defensive approaches deployed by car manufacturers. One common defense is conflict detection, which identifies anomalous messages from malicious senders by leveraging the fixed frequency at which Electronic Control Units (ECUs) broadcast CAN bus messages [19]. This makes many attacks impractical, such as directly injecting CAN bus messages to control the vehicle. Other defensive approaches include intrusion detection [56–58] and data authentication [36–40].

**8.3. Mobile App-Based Vulnerability Discovery**

With the rapid growth of the mobile app market, mobile app analysis has become a valuable tool for uncovering various vulnerabilities. Data flow analysis, for instance, tracks data flow, traces data of interest, and identifies vulnerabilities in phones, remote servers, and cloud services [59–66]. Inspired by these efforts, DONGLESCOPE uses static analysis to extract predefined messages from companion apps to study the security of OBD-II dongles.

#### 9. Conclusion

In this paper, we present the first comprehensive security analysis of 77 wireless OBD-II dongles available on Amazon in the US in February 2019. To systematically perform the analysis, we designed and implemented an automated tool, DONGLESCOPE, which identified five different types of vulnerabilities, with four being newly discovered. Our results show that each of these 77 dongles exposes at least two types of these vulnerabilities, indicating widespread vulnerability exposure among wireless OBD-II dongles on the market today. We constructed four classes of concrete attacks that can cause privacy leakage, property theft, and safety threats. We also discussed the root causes and feasible countermeasures and performed responsible disclosure.

As IoT devices increasingly find use in safety-critical domains such as vehicles, we expect that our domain-specific findings and their security/safety implications will prompt the development and deployment of principled security designs in these highly critical application domains, such as automotive IoT.
