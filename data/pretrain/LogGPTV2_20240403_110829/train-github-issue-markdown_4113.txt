  * Output of `node_modules/.bin/electron --version`: 3.0.2
  * Operating System (Platform and Version): macOS 10.14
  * Output of `node_modules/.bin/electron --version` on last known working Electron version (if applicable):
**Expected Behavior**  
There should be no grey line rendered at the top of the window area in
frameless window.
My conclusion is that Electron uses some obscure combination of window styles
that cause this behaviour. I was able to reproduce the same appearance when
using Cocoa API in the same fashion on a sample Xcode project.
**Actual behavior**  
On macOS Mojave the grey line is rendered at the top of the window area even
when the contents are transparent and the window is configured to be
frameless.
