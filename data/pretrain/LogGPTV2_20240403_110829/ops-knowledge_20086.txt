User: How to configure SSH password-free login in Linux environment?
Assistant: 1. Generate public key and private key Use the following command to generate public key and private key on the machine that needs password-free login: ``` ssh-keygen -t rsa ``` This command will generate a default public key file`~ /.ssh/id_rsa.pub` and a default private key file `~/.ssh/id_rsa`. 2. Copy the public key to the target machine Copy the generated public key file `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file of the target machine, you can use the following command: ``` ssh -copy-id username@remote_host ``` Or manually copy the contents of the public key file to the target machine's `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file. 3. Test password-free login Now you should be able to implement password-free login with the following command: ``` ssh username@remote_host ``` If you are not prompted to enter a password, then password-free login has been successfully configured.
