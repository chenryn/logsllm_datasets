 **Elasticsearch version** : 2.2.0
**JVM version** : 1.8.0_74
**OS version** : 3.13.0-74-generic #118-Ubuntu SMP (Ubuntu Server 14.04 LTS)
**Elasticsearch Client** : elasticsearch-py
**Description of the problem including expected versus actual behavior** :  
I am trying to add aliases with filters to some indexes. Basically I have
write and read aliases on an index, with filter and routing specified. Based
on some criteria, I need to modify the aliases to point to a new index, at
which time, I remove the write alias from the existing index, move it to the
newly created index and at the same add the same read alias to the newly
created index. I am using update_aliases api in the python client to perform
all three operations atomically.
_Expected behaviour_ : The write alias should be removed from the old index
and start pointing to the new index, while containing the filter and routing
specified.
_Observed behaviour_ : The write alias is removed from the old index, added to
the new index but doesnt contain the specified filter. Attaching code snippets
in steps to reproduce.
**Steps to reproduce** :
  * Apply alias actions:
    actions = {}
    actions['actions'] = [{'remove': {'index': u'goibibo_201612', 'alias': u'w_goibibo-serviceresponsesuccess_201612'}}, {'add': {'filter': {'term': {'primaryName': u'goibibo-serviceresponsesuccess'}}, 'index': u'goibibo-serviceresponsesuccess_201612', 'alias': u'w_goibibo-serviceresponsesuccess_201612'}}, {'add': {'filter': {'term': {'primaryName': u'goibibo-serviceresponsesuccess'}}, 'index': u'goibibo-serviceresponsesuccess_201612', 'alias': u'r_goibibo-serviceresponsesuccess_201612'}}]
    es.indices.update_aliases(body=actions)
  * Fetch alias (should contain the filter, but doesnt)
    es.indices.get_alias(name='w_goibibo-serviceresponsesuccess_201612')
    {u'goibibo-serviceresponsesuccess_201612': {u'aliases': {u'w_goibibo-serviceresponsesuccess_201612': {}}}}
