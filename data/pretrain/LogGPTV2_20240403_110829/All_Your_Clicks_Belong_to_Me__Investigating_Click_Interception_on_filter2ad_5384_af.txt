6 Discussion and Future Work
We discuss the limitations of our work, the possible mitigation
of the click interception threat, and our future work.
Third-party Script Detection. Our methodology for distin-
guishing first-party scripts from third-party scripts is not 100%
accurate. First, the domain substring matching can be prob-
lematic if an adversary can create victim-specific subdomains.
For example, a third-party can intentionally generate a sub-
domain xyz.third-party.org by adding a new entry in its name
server. Our technique would mislabel this subdomain as a first-
party URL if it is included by xyz.com. Second, an organiza-
tion may use distinct email addresses for its subsidiaries. For
instance, the SOA email address of https://www.instagram.com/
is PI:EMAIL, whereas that of https:
//www.facebook.net/ is dns@facebook.com. We classify scripts
loaded directly from Facebook on Instagram as third-party
scripts even though Instagram is owned by Facebook. Al-
though our approach to determining the relationship between
two hosts is not complete, it is good enough for achieving
our goal and provides better results compared with a similar
approach using only whois records [4].
Measurement Scope. We visited only the main pages of
Alexa top 250K websites, so we could miss scripts that are
loaded only in their sub pages. However, our goal is to have a
preliminary understanding of the click interception problem.
We do not intend to and are not able to cover all pages and
scripts that can be found on these websites. In the future, we
954    28th USENIX Security Symposium

will consider sub pages of these websites to investigate the
differences between the main pages and the sub pages.
Artificial Interaction with Web Pages. OBSERVER applies
an artificial way to interact with websites, i.e., using a script
to click all the elements on a page, in order to automate the
analysis. This could be different from the normal behavior
of a real human being. Nevertheless, our goal is to collect as
much click-related data as possible in each page visit. It would
be an interesting research topic to study if developers would
write code to distinguish authentic clicks from automatically
generated ones9.
Generating Security Warnings. Click interception can di-
rect a user to an unknown URL by modifying first-party hy-
perlinks or hijacking user clicks on first-party elements. It
exploits the fact that the user cannot determine the provenance
of the URL that he or she is about to visit (unintentionally).
To protect a user from visiting potentially attacker-controlled
URLs, a possible defense is to provide the user the prove-
nance information regarding each hyperlink and click. In
particular, the browser can display a message alongside each
hyperlink about its provenance, e.g., if the associated URL
is provided by the first-party website or a third party. The
additional message needs to be unforgeable and tamper-proof
from JavaScript code, such that the adversary cannot manipu-
late such security-related data. One potential implementation
is to utilize the browser UI that is usually not accessible to
JavaScript. For example, we can display the message in the
status bar when the user hovers the mouse over a link. Sim-
ilarly, to defend against event-listener interception, we can
display an unforgeable warning message if the user hovers
over an element that is potentially intercepted by a third-party
script. However, this may cause a lot of false positives as an
event handler may not necessarily initiate a navigation upon
user click. Therefore, it might be better to show such warning
when the user actually performs the click, as [10] does. Ac-
cording to our experiment, OBSERVER introduces negligible
performance overhead on navigation. It is thus suitable to be
extended as a real-time detection tool for the end users. We
plan to extend OBSERVER by incorporating these defenses,
and conduct a user study to evaluate their effectiveness.
Ensuring Link and Click Integrity. The above defenses
require a user to make security decisions, which might not be
very effective in practice. Alternatively, we can let the browser
automatically enforce integrity policies for hyperlinks and
click event handlers. For example, an integrity policy can
specify that all first-party hyperlinks shall not be modifiable by
third-party JavaScript code. One may further specify that third-
party scripts are not allowed to control frame navigations,
although listening for user click is still permitted. Enforcing
all such policies would effectively prevent click-interception
by hyperlinks and event handlers. However, it might also

break the functionalities of some third-party components. To
give the user and the website administrator better control, the
polices can specify the permissions for each script, matched
by an absolute URL, a domain name, a wild card, or a secret
token, mimicking the Content Security Policy [33]. We plan to
develop and evaluate such an integrity protection mechanism
as our future work.
7 Conclusion
We have investigated the click interception problem on the
Web with a custom analysis framework developed based on
the Chromium browser. We collected data from the Alexa
top 250K websites and identified several techniques that can
be employed to intercept user clicks. We detected that 437
third-party scripts intercepted user clicks using hyperlinks,
event handlers and visual deceptions on 613 websites. We
further revealed that many third-party scripts intercept user
clicks for monetization via committing ad click fraud. In
addition, we demonstrated that click interception can lead
victim users to malicious contents. Our research sheds light
on an emerging client side threat, and highlights the need to
restrict the privilege of third-party JavaScript code.
