the
consequences when the RAC deployer gives up achieving the
path isolation property for the sake of the guaranteed detour
path establishment. We now consider that the RAC deployer
is aware of all the consequences of having non-isolated paths
and thus chooses to achieve the path isolation property at
the cost of the guaranteed detour path establishment. In the
other words, the RAC deployer may attempt to establish an
isolated path, but its establishment is not guaranteed because
the upstream ASes may ﬁlter long BGP poisoning UPDATE
messages (e.g., with an AS path length ≥ 255), which is often
necessary for the path isolation property.
Although the detour path establishment is not guaranteed
for each BGP poisoning message, the RAC deployer may make
its best effort to ﬁnd a possible detour path after multiple
trials and errors. For example, it may try to establish different
detour paths repeatedly until it ﬁnds one detour path that can
be established. In this section, we ask whether a RAC deployer
can ﬁnd any such detour path, whose intermediate ASes all
allow long (e.g., ≥ 255) BGP messages.
A. Identifying ASes that Would Filter Long BGP Messages
Our aim is to identify the set of ASes that would drop
BGP messages with AS path length ≥ 255 but allow messages
with AS path length < 255, which we denote as D≥255.
Knowing the set D≥255 is crucial for our analysis because
if a detour path contains one or more ASes in D≥255, it would
be ﬁltered out by them and thus the detour path cannot be
formed. However, there is no direct way to measure D≥255
because only the BGP messages that have been allowed (and
thus not dropped) are recorded in the public BGP dataset (e.g.,
RIPE [12], RouteView [14]). Thus, instead, we rely on an
indirect way to estimate the ASes in D≥255.
Recall from Section IV-B, we have observed a fraction of
abnormal BGP messages with an AS path length longer than
30 on the Internet. We can identify the ASes that accept and
propagate such long messages by analyzing public datasets
(e.g., RIPE [12]). Let us denote the set of ASes that allow
BGP messages with an AS path length longer than 255 as
A≥255, and denote the set of ASes that allow BGP messages
with an AS path length in the range [30,255) as A[30,255).
We revisit the six-month period RIPE measurement data (see
Section IV-B) to calculate the ASes in sets A≥255 and A[30,255)
and show their cardinalities in Table II.
We are interested in studying the set differences between
A≥255 and A[30,255), or (A[30,255) \ A≥255), which includes
nearly 500 ASes. These ASes allow AS path length in the
range [30, 255) but do not appear to accept any AS path length

≥ 255. There are two possible explanations: (1) these ASes
also accept BGP messages with AS-path ≥ 255 but they do not
receive messages with such long AS-path during the six-month
period; and (2) these ASes drop such long BGP messages.
To evaluate how likely the ﬁrst explanation holds true, we
analyze some highly inﬂuential ASes in the current Internet
(i.e., top-ranked ASes in the CAIDA AS rank9) and evaluate
whether they would allow long BGP UPDATE messages with
AS path length longer than 255 (i.e., belong to A≥255) or
appear in the (A[30,255) \ A≥255) set. We ﬁnd that some highly
inﬂuential Tier-1 and Tier-2 ASes (e.g., Cogent, NTT, TATA)
seem to allow long BGP messages whereas some others (e.g.,
Level 3, Telia, Singtel, AT&T) appear to not propagate any
BGP messages with AS-path longer than 255, see Table III in
Appendix E for more details. Given the dataset is collected in
a six-month period, it is highly unlikely that such inﬂuential
ASes do not receive any AS path ≥ 255 during this six-month
observation period.
On the other hand, the second explanation is well-aligned
with some conjectures we have mentioned in Section IV-B,
e.g., it is advisable that the ISPs to ﬁlter out BGP messages
with unnecessarily long AS path length. Moreover, Cisco
routers by default are conﬁgured to drop messages with an
AS path longer than 255 [46], [47]. Hence, we assume that
the difference between A≥255 and A[30,255) is because some
ASes ﬁlter BGP messages when their AS path ≥ 255. That is,
D≥255 = (A[30,255) \ A≥255).

B. Limited Feasible Detour Paths
Based on the set D≥255 inferred from Equation 1, we now
evaluate all the enumerated detour paths for the selected 1,000
C–D pairs. Each pair may have more than one possible detour
path and we evaluate if each detour path contains any AS in
the set D≥255 (i.e., AS that would ﬁlter BGP messages with
an AS path length ≥ 255). After removing such would-be
infeasible detours (because BGP messages would be ﬁltered),
the percentage of the remaining feasible detour paths is less
than 1% of total detour paths for the 80% of the tested cases.
Furthermore, we measure the number of disjoint feasible
detour paths for each C–D pair. Note that when there exist
more disjoint feasible detour paths, it is harder to congest the
critical ﬂows because a transit-link ﬂooding attacker must ﬂood
at least one link per disjoint path simultaneously.10 Figure 17

10Note that isolated detour paths have no path leakage and thus the detour-
learning attacks are ineffective.

presents the distribution of the number of disjoint feasible
detour paths when ASes in the set D≥255 ﬁlter BGP messages
with long AS path (see the solid line). We see that in the
vast majority of cases (e.g., 80%), an adversary only needs
to ﬂood at most three transit links to congest all the feasible
detour paths. Worse, the RAC deployer has zero or only one
disjoint feasible detour path in 55% of the cases, making it
unusable. This strictly limits the RAC deployer’s diversity to
choose different detour paths. We can see that the ﬁltering at
the ASes in D≥255 signiﬁcantly reduces the disjoint feasible
detours by comparing the above result with the one where no
AS ﬁlters BGP messages (see the dotted line).
Note that higher diversity of feasible detour paths is nec-
essary for the reliable operation of the RAC defense because
any established detour path will eventually become public
knowledge found in the public BGP dataset (e.g., RIPE [12],
RouteViews [14]) roughly 10-15 minutes after its ﬁrst an-
nouncement and thus the RAC deployer should switch to
another detour path frequently. Then, the RAC deployer would
choose a new detour path from a small set (e.g., 3 or less for
the majority of cases) of the disjoint feasible detour paths. With
such a small set of disjoint feasible detour paths, the detour
path change patterns of the RAC deployer are, unfortunately,
extremely limited.
VIII. HOW TO MAKE THE RAC DEFENSE POSSIBLE
We have shown that the RAC defense is impractical in
the current Internet due to the incompatible BGP protocol and
its practice. A natural question that arises is whether we can
change the BGP protocol and its practice to make the RAC
defense possible, and, if possible, what the cost of the changes
would be.
From what we have observed, we can make the RAC
defense possible by (1) allowing the BGP protocol to include
much longer AS paths than its current maximum 2,034 [52]
because the current maximum is not enough for many RAC
detours (see Section IV-A) and (2) forcing all the BGP routers
to accept BGP UPDATE messages regardless of their AS path
length. However, these changes are not trivial. Making changes
to the standardized BGP protocol and achieving large-scale
deployment of the changes may require several years of effort.
Moreover, transit ASes may not have clear incentives to accept
the new changes after all because they do not directly beneﬁt
from the RAC defense.
Worse yet, when the Internet is forced to support it, the
RAC’s rerouting capability can be easily misused for malicious
purposes. For example, a destination AS with large incoming
trafﬁc volume can control the trafﬁc volume of its upstream
transit ASes arbitrarily and make their operation unreliable.
Route manipulation can also be launched by transit ASes for
eavesdropping of critical ﬂows. Since the main scope of this
paper is the evaluation of the feasibility of the RAC defense
but not its potential misuses, we leave more detailed analysis
of these misuses for future work.
IX. CONCLUSION
Our
in-depth study on a recent,
intriguing rerouting-
based defense proposal [51] against server/link-ﬂooding at-
tacks shows that a rerouting-based DDoS defense is fundamen-
tally challenging because: (1) the current inter-domain routing
protocol (i.e, BGP) is not expressive enough to support ﬁne-
grained control over inbound trafﬁc, either directly or indi-
rectly; and (2) one may attempt to abuse some routing features
that are not intended for rerouting (e.g., loop detection) to
achieve dynamic detouring of selected critical ﬂows, but such
an ad hoc approach only makes an unreliable solution due to
the inconsistency among protocol speciﬁcations, implementa-
tions, and community’s best current practice.
Our analysis has led us to learn several important method-
ological lessons:
1. Any new defense proposal against ﬂooding attacks de-
signed for immediate deployment must consider real-world
constraints imposed by implementations, ISP operations,
and legal consequences [50], [7], [6], not just the basic
feasibility analysis based on protocol speciﬁcations;
2. It is of utmost importance to conduct a rigorous security
analysis on any DDoS defense proposal. Realistic adver-
sary capabilities should be assumed (e.g., knowing the
defense strategies of the targeted networks; see Section VI)
and the desired defense properties should be deﬁned explic-
itly (e.g., the invisibility of detour paths; see Section VI-A);
and
3. New proposals interacting with large systems and pro-
tocols, such as BGP, must demonstrate a comprehen-
sive evaluation with complementing evaluation tools (e.g.,
SSFNet [13]) along with real experiments.
Our study on the (in)feasibility of the RAC defense con-
ﬁrms the previous conclusion of the major literature on this
topic — strong bandwidth and path isolation against DDoS
attacks must be considered as a main security feature by
design. We hope that our ﬁndings will renew our quest to
moving towards new DDoS-resilient Internet architectures.
