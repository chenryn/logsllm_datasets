**Abstract:**
In today's globalized and competitive market, consumers are increasingly demanding higher quality products and services. Educational institutions, including universities, are not exempt from this trend. However, many institutions, including universities, continue to use outdated structures and methods that no longer meet these emerging demands. This project aims to address this issue by introducing a prototype workflow management system specifically designed for the University of Coimbra. The system is intended to promote cooperative work patterns and automate the university's business processes, thereby enhancing service quality and operational efficiency.

## 1. Introduction
Over the past two decades, the information technology (IT) market has seen rapid advancements, particularly in personal computers and information networks. These developments have made it possible to have a computer in every office and to connect all computers, realizing the concept of the "global village." The next logical step is to create inclusive environments that support more focused and productive interaction, particularly through the support of cooperative work. Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) has played a crucial role in this evolution, leading to the development of workflow systems. These systems enable organizations to respond to increasing client demands and adapt to environmental changes by analyzing, restructuring, and automating their processes.

## 2. The Project
The project, called SCAPO (Computerized System for Organizational Processes), was developed to analyze and adapt a workflow system for the University of Coimbra. The primary goal was to modernize the university's administration by innovating and reorganizing its processes. The prototype was designed to operate in the Faculty of Science and Technology (FCTUC), one of the seven faculties at the 700-year-old University of Coimbra. The choice of this faculty was based on three key factors: the age of the organization, the large number of students, and the need for interaction with external bodies.

## 3. The Organization
The University of Coimbra, founded in 1290, is one of the largest and oldest universities in Portugal, with over 20,000 students, 8,000 of whom are in the Science Faculty. The FCTUC was chosen for the prototype due to its historical context, which may have led to redundant or ineffective processes, the large and diverse student body, and the need for interactions with external entities.

## 4. Modelling of Processes
### 4.1 Method
We used the STRIM method (Systematic Technique for Role & Interaction Modelling) [Ould, 95] to model the processes. This method provides a set of techniques for modeling organizational behavior in a simple, expressive, and powerful way. It is often used in re-engineering contexts, where the focus is on processes rather than functions.

### 4.2 Processes Identified in FCTUC
After studying the university processes, we identified two workflow patterns: administrative and ad hoc. Administrative processes include basic activities like equivalence requests from students, while ad hoc processes involve multiple interactions between workers to accomplish specific tasks.

## 5. The Work Platform
We chose the Lotus Notes environment to build our prototype. Unlike traditional workflow tools, Lotus Notes provides a groupware environment that promotes cooperative work. This environment connects all university users through a common platform, offering several advantages:

1. **Integrated Development Environment:** Facilitates the development of client/assistant applications.
2. **Platform Compatibility:** Compatible with various platforms.
3. **Security Mechanisms:** Includes data encoding, passwords, and certificates.
4. **Remote Access:** Allows remote access to data via networks or dial-in.
5. **Directory Service:** Represents the organization.
6. **Email Client:** Easy-to-use and transfers messages to various postal systems.
7. **User Interface:** Provides an intuitive and consistent interface for all users, regardless of the platform.

## 6. Global Design
A main platform will be installed across the organization, with servers in each faculty and department storing human resources data. These servers will be interconnected, creating a global network. Each server will have a group of clients representing authorized workers who can access and work on the processes. The system supports and authorizes remote work according to internal administrative policies.

## 7. The Prototype
The prototype, built using LotusScript, includes four modules:
1. **Definition of Workflow:** Describes the process route independently of the engine, allowing flexibility and generic use.
2. **Engine:** Carries the process through the organization, notifying participants via email.
3. **Processes:** Entry point for users, bringing together documents and allowing participants to consult and annex documents.
4. **Management and Monitoring of Processes:** Maintains an updated report of the state of processes, providing an essential source of information.

## 8. Conclusions
### 8.1 Achievements
The development of the workflow management system at the University of Coimbra has been a significant step in demonstrating the success of such systems in educational organizations. Key achievements include:
- **Reduced Paper Usage:** Electronic forms replaced paper, significantly reducing the amount of paper used.
- **Improved Process Time:** Transport time between entities was reduced, and document handling was streamlined.
- **Enhanced Management and Monitoring:** The system provided an updated status of processes, facilitating better management and monitoring.

### 8.2 Difficulties Encountered
Despite the benefits, several challenges were encountered:
- **Change of Information Context:** Bringing in elements from outside the university required OCR techniques to convert paper documents to digital formats.
- **Lack of Staff Training:** Cultural issues and lack of training in the area posed significant barriers.
- **Redundant Processes:** Ancient and redundant processes had to be eliminated using BPR techniques.
- **Integration with Legacy Systems:** Careful integration with existing database and email systems was necessary.

### 8.3 Future Work
Future work will focus on the total integration of a similar system in the University of Coimbra. This will involve an in-depth analysis of the entire organization, applying BPR techniques, and interacting with existing systems to create a reference model for interconnecting various Portuguese universities.
