(usdl:yields) resources (lines 41-42). Receives is the input required and yields
corresponds to the outcome yielded by an interaction point. The example shows
that the interaction point ip Advertise receives an dbpedia:Advertising and
yields a dbpedia:Contract. Naturally, other computer-processable data sources
such as freebase.com can be used.
While the previous example of an interaction point involved only human
participants, the example from Listing 4 illustrates a fully automated interaction
which does not require human intervention. Linked USDL covers the most widely
used human-based communication channels (e.g., email, phone, and mail) by
meansofvCard(astandardforelectroniccontactdetails),andapplication-driven

A usdl:ServiceOffering is an offering made by a gr:BusinessEntity of
one or more usdl:Service to customers. An offering usually associates a price,
legal terms of use, and service level agreements with a service. In other words,
it makes a service a tradable entity. Listing 5 illustrates an offering named
offering SLastFM for the service service SLastFM (Lines 1 and 10). A service
offering may have limited validity over geographical regions or time. The offering
adds various pieces of information such as temporal validity, eligible regions, and
accepted payment methods (Lines 2-9).

6 Related Work
In the past, schemas have been explored to describe (web) services. For example,
WSDL, a W3C standard, focused on describing technical aspects of web services
such as interaction interface and protocols. Since WSDL was essentially a spec-
ification for the syntax to describe services it was insufficient, the accuracy of
service search algorithms was inadequate, especially at a global scale. Therefore,
there was research streams towards the semantic representation of web services.
Service descriptions were annotated with semantics to improve not only search
but also composability and integration. As a result, new description languages,
such as OWL-S [13], Semantic Annotation for WSDL (i.e., SAWSDL) [11], and
WSMO [16], were proposed. The research has only tackled the semantic enrich-
ment of function-based services, such as WSDL and REST, by using domain
knowledge describing mainly technical interfaces.
In fact, legal aspects, pricing models, and service levels are all elements which
need to be explicitly described when dealing with cloud services. Therefore,
efforts were redirected to the development of new languages to capture business
and operational perspectives beside the technical one. USDL [6] and Linked
USDL [15] are probably the most comprehensive attempts.
The most notable effort able to represent and reason about business models,
services, and value networks is the e3 family of ontologies which includes the
e3service and e3value ontologies [1, 9]. This research has, however, not been
much concerned with the computational and operational perspectives covering
for instance the actual interaction with services. Likewise, the technical issues
related to enabling a Web-scale deployment and adoption of these solutions were
not core to this work. GoodRelations [10] (GR) on the contrary is a popular
vocabulary for describing semantically products and offerings. Although GR
originally aimed to support both services and products, it is mostly centred on
products to the detriment of its coverage for modelling services, leaving aside for
instance the coverage of modes of interaction, or the support for value chains.
7 Conclusion
Services and service systems, such as cloud services and digital government
services, are showing increasing interests from both academia and industry.
Evolution and Overview of Linked USDL 15
Among the many aspects which still require to be studied, such as service
innovation, design, analytics, optimization, and economics, service description is
oneofthemostpressingandcriticalcomponentssinceitisakeystonesupporting
a web of tradable services.
While several service description languages have been developed over the past
10 years to model software-based service descriptions, such as WSDL, OWL-S,
SAWSDL, e3service, and e3value ontologies, a language that also covers business
and interaction aspects is missing. This paper summarizes our efforts to create
USDL and, more recently, Linked USDL, a family of languages providing a
comprehensive view on services to be used by providers, brokers, and consumers
when searching, evaluating, and selecting services.
