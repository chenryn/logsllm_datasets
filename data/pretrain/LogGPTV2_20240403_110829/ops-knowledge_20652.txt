User: Given that the code has been written indepdently of platform, how do I build a package for MAC OS when I am on Windows and the package has been successfully built there? I can use python setup.py bdist_msi on windows, but not python setup.py bdist_dmg, since I am not on MAC. What to do about that?
Python 3.3, tkinter, cxFreeze, Windows 8.
Assistant: I am pretty sure OSX build tools (XCode et. al.) exist only on Apple platforms and there is no business rationale why Apple would have ported them to Windows.
So the probable answer is "buy Mac".
