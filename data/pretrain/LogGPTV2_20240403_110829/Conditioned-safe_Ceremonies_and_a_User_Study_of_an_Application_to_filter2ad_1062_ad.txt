31% without warnings), but we did not ﬁnd this difference
signiﬁcant (p = 0.65 with warnings, and p = 0.17 without
warnings; Fisher’s exact test). We found no signiﬁcant cor-
relations between attack success and the demographics we
reported in Section 7.1. In particular, we found no evidence
that frequent browser use, previous experience with online
ﬁnancial transactions, or a technical undergraduate major
area helped users resist our attacks.
7.3 Efﬁcacy of our warnings
We found no evidence that including warnings in reg-
istration emails helped users resist our attack. To evalu-
ate the effectiveness of our contextual email warnings, we
compared the attack success rates of group 2 vs. group 3
(forwarding attacks, with and without warnings, resp.), and
group 4 vs. group 5 (cut and paste attacks, with and without
warnings, resp.). For the forwarding attack, 40% of group 2
users were vulnerable, and 31% of group 3 users were vul-
nerable (p = 0.48 for Fisher’s exact test). For the cut and
paste attack, 47% of users in both group 4 and group 5 were
vulnerable (p = 1 for Fisher’s exact test).
During the exit survey, we showed each user a screen-
shot of the warning corresponding to her study group (Sec-
tion 6.4.3) and asked her “Do you remember seeing the
above warning at any point during the study?”, and if yes,
“describe how it affected your decisions (if at all) while
interacting with the study Web site.” Table 3 summarizes
the number of yes/no responses. For group 2 and 4 users,
who received warnings in registration emails, 31% reported
that they did not remember the warning. Among group 3
and 5 users, who only received warnings on the study Web
page, 68% did not remember the warning. This difference
is statistically signiﬁcant (p < 0.001 for Fisher’s exact test).
66% of challenge question users also did not remember the
warning.
We found no evidence that users who recalled seeing
our warnings were more likely to resist our attack. Of the
191 users responding to the warning recall question, 85
remembered seeing our warning and 106 did not (see Ta-
ble 4). Among the users who remembered seeing our warn-
ing, 45% were vulnerable, and among the users who did not
remember seeing our warning, 56% were vulnerable. This
different is not statistically signiﬁcant (p = .147 for Fisher’s
exact test). We found no statistically signiﬁcant difference
within groups, either.
Among the users who remembered seeing the warning,
Table 5 summarizes the self-reported effects that the warn-
ings had on those users. Of the 85 users who remembered
our warnings, only 10 users’ responses (12%) indicated that
our warnings helped them resist our attack. 38 of these users
(45%) indicated that the warnings had little or no impact
on their decisions. 4 users (5%) indicated that the warning
slightly inﬂuenced their decision making during the attack,
but they ultimately followed the attack instructions. 7 users
(8%) mentioned that the warnings made them “feel safer”
at our site or be more careful in general. The responses of
11 users were inconclusive or did not clearly ﬁt in one of
these categories.
7.4 User suspicion of our attacks
To gauge users’ suspicion during our simulated attack,
we asked users “During your interactions with UCB Movie
Predictions, did you ever see something which looked sus-
picious or dangerous?” and “describe what your reaction

was and if you did anything, what you did.” Overall, only
6 (15%) challenge questions users and 13 (8%) email users
reported seeing anything suspicious during the study. Four
of the challenge question users reported that the certiﬁcate
warning caused their suspicion, but only 1 of those users re-
sisted the attack.8 One challenge question user reported that

chine made her suspicious. The 13 suspicious email users

questions, so I answered them” and “I thought it was proce-
dure to answer these questions.” 10 vulnerable users (26%)
viewed the attack as an error that they should try to ﬁx, e.g.,
“I thought the site’s cookie may have been erased which is
why it wasn’t recognizing my computer, so I answered.” 4
vulnerable users (11%) trusted the Web site or indicated that
since the site was associated with UC-Berkeley, it should be
safe. Of the 3 challenge question users who resisted the at-
tack, one user noticed the certiﬁcate warning and stopped,
and the other two users did not respond to this question.
7.5 User reasoning during our attacks
To help understand users’ thought processes during the
simulated attack, we showed each user a screenshot of the
attack instructions corresponding to her group and asked
her: “If you followed the above instructions, explain why.
If you chose not follow the instructions, explain why not. If
you don’t remember this page or what you did, tell us what
you don’t remember.” We did not explicitly identify this as
the “attack”.
Challenge question users. Among the 38 vulnerable
users in the challenge question group, 22 users (58%) said
that they complied with the attack instructions because they
thought it was what they needed to do to log in. Rep-
resentative responses include: “Those were my challenge
8Most browsers show certiﬁcate warnings in popup windows. Firefox
3 and Internet Explorer 7 present full screen interstitial warning pages, but
Firefox 3 was not ofﬁcially released until after we completed our study.
Among the 41 challenge question users (who were the only users who saw
certiﬁcate warnings – see Section 6.6), twenty ﬁve used Firefox 1 or 2,
two used IE 6, six used IE 7, seven used Safari, and one used Epiphany.
Among the 4 users who reported the certiﬁcate warning as the cause of
their suspicion, three used Firefox 2 and one used IE 7.
Email users. Among the 66 vulnerable email users, 26
users (39%) complied with the attack instructions because
they thought it was what they needed to do to log in. A
representative response is “I copy and pasted the link be-
cause it said in bold to do so. It seemed like that was what I
was supposed to do.” 11 vulnerable users (17%) viewed the
attack as an error that they should ﬁx, e.g., “I ﬁgured some-
thing was wrong with your registration system and thus fol-
lowed instructions.” 20 vulnerable users (30%) trusted the
Web site or indicated that since the site was associated with
UC-Berkeley, it should be safe. 8 vulnerable users (12%)
indicated that they complied with our attack instructions be-
cause they did not associate much risk with our Web site.
Among the 93 email users who resisted the attack, the
responses of 37 users (40%) indicated that although they
may have recognized the instructions were different from
previous registrations, they decided to click the registration
link ﬁrst, despite instructions to the contrary, or did not read
the attack instructions carefully. Representative responses
include: “I did not follow the instructions because it was
easier to just click” and “Usually, in a veriﬁcation email,
you are supposed to click the link.”

Table 5. Self(cid:173)reported effects of our warnings on users who remembered seeing them.
17 resisting users (18%) indicated that they did not no-
tice the attack instructions. For example, “I never saw these
instructions.” All except two of these users clicked on the
registration link; the other two users timed out the attack.
10 users (11%) cited our warnings as helping them re-
sist the attack, e.g., “The website and the email I received
were telling me contradicting things so I just went with what
the email told me” and “I didn’t follow the instructions be-
cause they were contradictory to the warnings in the previ-
ous email.”
We found evidence that 15 users (16%) initially consid-
ered the attack instructions, but eventually gave up because
they found them too difﬁcult, decided it was not worth the
hassle, or made a mistake in following them. 5 users ex-
plicitly indicated this in their responses, e.g., “I did not be-
cause it was too much of a hassle” and “I ﬁgured I would
see if the site would be on track later.” The remaining 10
users attempted to follow the attack instructions, but made a
“mistake”, e.g., they forwarded our welcome email or copy
and pasted a previously used registration link. Although we
count these users as resisting our attack, they may be more
likely to fall for future attacks than other users who resisted.
The responses of 3 resisting users (3%) were hard to in-
terpret. They stated that they followed the attack instruc-
tions, but we have no evidence that they attempted to do so;
they all clicked on the link quickly. One possible explana-
tion is that they did not actually notice the attack instruc-
tions, but attempted to please us during the survey or avoid
appearing as if they disregarded our instructions.
7.6 Ecological validity
To evaluate the ecological validity of our study, we
sought to determine how much risk users perceived while
using our site. Since risk is subjective, we asked each user
to tell us the biggest security concerns she has while brows-
ing the World Wide Web and the precautions she takes to
protect herself when logging into Web sites. Then, we
asked her to rank how often and thoroughly she applies
those precautions when logging into the following types of
Web sites: banking, shopping, PayPal, Web email, social
networking, and our study site. The answer choices were:
“rarely”, “sometimes”, “usually”, “always”, and “I don’t
use this type of Web site”. We summarize the responses in
Table 6. Users reported that they did not take the same level
of precautions on our site as they do with other sites which
handle money. Over 64% of users reported that they at least
“usually” take security precautions at those sites, but only
27% of users said they at least “usually” took precautions
at our study Web site. Users more closely associated the
risks at our study Web site with a Web email site or social
networking site.
In users’ responses to other questions, 2 users explic-
itly mentioned that they took precautions because we had
their PayPal email address, e.g., “I wanted to stay secure so
that people couldn’t come in and take my PayPal account.”
However, 14 users explicitly mentioned that they consid-
ered our study site to be low risk because they felt they had
little to lose, e.g., “even if someone had hacked the site,
what had I to lose? An experiment account? I was not par-
ticularly worried.”
8 Analysis and discussion
Our warnings were ineffective. Our results suggest that
our warnings had little impact users’ decisions, even when
users had the opportunity to see warnings during the sim-
ulated attacks. We found no evidence that including warn-
ings in registration emails helped users resist our attacks.
Many users did not remember our warnings or indicated
they had little impact on their decisions during the study.
Although including contextual warnings in email seemed to
improve the likelihood that a user would recall seeing them,
we found no evidence that users who recalled seeing our
warnings were more likely to resist our attack. Our results
are consistent with a recent study by Egelman et al. which
suggests that passive warnings such as ours are ineffective
in helping users resist attacks [16].
