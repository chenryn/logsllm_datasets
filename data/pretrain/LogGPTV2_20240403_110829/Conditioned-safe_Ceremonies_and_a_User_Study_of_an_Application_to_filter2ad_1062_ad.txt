### 3.1 Statistical Analysis of Attack Success Rates

We observed a difference in attack success rates between groups with and without warnings (31% without warnings), but this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.65 with warnings, and p = 0.17 without warnings; Fisher’s exact test). Additionally, we found no significant correlations between attack success and the demographic factors reported in Section 7.1. Specifically, frequent browser use, previous experience with online financial transactions, or a technical undergraduate major did not appear to help users resist our attacks.

### 3.2 Efficacy of Warnings

Our analysis did not provide evidence that including warnings in registration emails helped users resist our simulated attacks. To evaluate the effectiveness of contextual email warnings, we compared the attack success rates of Group 2 (forwarding attacks with warnings) and Group 3 (forwarding attacks without warnings), as well as Group 4 (cut and paste attacks with warnings) and Group 5 (cut and paste attacks without warnings).

- **Forwarding Attacks:**
  - Group 2 (with warnings): 40% of users were vulnerable.
  - Group 3 (without warnings): 31% of users were vulnerable.
  - Fisher’s exact test: p = 0.48.

- **Cut and Paste Attacks:**
  - Group 4 (with warnings): 47% of users were vulnerable.
  - Group 5 (without warnings): 47% of users were vulnerable.
  - Fisher’s exact test: p = 1.

During the exit survey, we showed each user a screenshot of the warning corresponding to their study group and asked if they remembered seeing it. Table 3 summarizes the responses:

| Group | Warnings in Email? | User Remembered Seeing Warning? | No Response | Yes | No |
|-------|--------------------|---------------------------------|-------------|-----|----|
| 1     | N/A                | X                               | 65.9% (27)  | 25.0% (10) | 59.0% (23) |
| 2     | X                  | 37.5% (15)                      | 77.5% (31)  | 31.7% (13) | 62.5% (25) |
| 3     |                    | 41.0% (16)                      | 57.5% (23)  | 20.0% (8)  | 2.4% (1)   |
| 4     | X                  | 12.5% (5)                       | 0.0% (0)    | 5.0% (2)   | 2.5% (1)   |
| 5     |                    |                                 |             |             |             |

For Group 2 and Group 4 users who received warnings in registration emails, 31% reported not remembering the warning. Among Group 3 and Group 5 users, who only received warnings on the study webpage, 68% did not remember the warning. This difference is statistically significant (p < 0.001, Fisher’s exact test). Additionally, 66% of challenge question users also did not remember the warning.

We found no evidence that users who recalled seeing our warnings were more likely to resist our attack. Of the 191 users responding to the warning recall question, 85 remembered seeing our warning, and 106 did not (Table 4):

| Users Who Remembered Seeing Our Warnings | Users Who Did Not Remember Seeing Our Warning | Total |
|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-------|
| Safe                                      | 45% (38)                                       | 44.3% (47) |
| Vulnerable                                | 55.7% (47)                                     | 55.7% (59) |
| Total                                     | 85                                             | 106   |

This difference is not statistically significant (p = 0.147, Fisher’s exact test). We also found no statistically significant differences within groups.

Among the users who remembered seeing the warning, Table 5 summarizes the self-reported effects:

| Self-Reported Effect of Warning on User | Little or None | Helped Resist Attack | Recalled During Attack but No Help | “Felt Safer” | Other | No Response | Total |
|-----------------------------------------|----------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------|--------|-------------|-------|
| Group 1                                 | N/A            | X                    | X                                 | 8            | 8      | 11          | 7     | 4     | 38    | 85    |
| Group 2                                 | 8              | 8                    | 11                                | 7            | 4      | 38          | 85    |
| Group 3                                 | 15             | 13                   | 25                                | 16           | 23     | 8           | 85    |
| Group 4                                 | 15             | 13                   | 25                                | 16           | 23     | 8           | 85    |
| Group 5                                 | 15             | 13                   | 25                                | 16           | 23     | 8           | 85    |
| Total                                   | 15             | 13                   | 25                                | 16           | 23     | 8           | 85    |

Of the 85 users who remembered our warnings, only 10 (12%) indicated that the warnings helped them resist the attack. 38 users (45%) stated that the warnings had little or no impact on their decisions. 4 users (5%) mentioned that the warning slightly influenced their decision-making during the attack, but they ultimately followed the attack instructions. 7 users (8%) felt safer at our site or were more careful in general. The responses of 11 users were inconclusive or did not fit into these categories.

### 3.3 User Suspicion of Simulated Attacks

To gauge users’ suspicion during our simulated attack, we asked if they saw anything suspicious or dangerous and for their reactions. Overall, only 6 (15%) challenge question users and 13 (8%) email users reported seeing anything suspicious. Four challenge question users reported that the certificate warning caused their suspicion, but only one of those users resisted the attack. One challenge question user reported that the re-registration requirement made her suspicious. The 13 suspicious email users reported that the attack instructions caused their suspicion, but only 6 of those users resisted the attack.

### 3.4 User Reasoning During Simulated Attacks

To understand users’ thought processes during the simulated attack, we asked them to explain why they followed or did not follow the attack instructions. We did not explicitly identify this as the "attack."

- **Challenge Question Users:**
  - 22 out of 38 vulnerable users (58%) complied with the attack instructions because they thought it was necessary to log in.
  - Representative responses: "Those were my challenge questions, so I answered them" and "I thought it was procedure to answer these questions."
  - 10 vulnerable users (26%) viewed the attack as an error that they should fix.
  - 4 vulnerable users (11%) trusted the website or indicated that since it was associated with UC-Berkeley, it should be safe.

- **Email Users:**
  - 26 out of 66 vulnerable users (39%) complied with the attack instructions because they thought it was necessary to log in.
  - Representative response: "I copy and pasted the link because it said in bold to do so. It seemed like that was what I was supposed to do."
  - 11 vulnerable users (17%) viewed the attack as an error that they should fix.
  - 20 vulnerable users (30%) trusted the website or indicated that since it was associated with UC-Berkeley, it should be safe.
  - 8 vulnerable users (12%) indicated that they complied with the attack instructions because they did not associate much risk with our website.

Among the 93 email users who resisted the attack, 37 users (40%) recognized that the instructions were different from previous registrations but decided to click the registration link first or did not read the attack instructions carefully. 17 resisting users (18%) did not notice the attack instructions. 10 users (11%) cited our warnings as helping them resist the attack. 15 users (16%) initially considered the attack instructions but eventually gave up due to difficulty or inconvenience. The responses of 3 resisting users (3%) were hard to interpret.

### 3.5 Ecological Validity

To evaluate the ecological validity of our study, we asked users about their security concerns and precautions when logging into different types of websites. Table 6 summarizes the responses:

| Site Type | Rarely | Sometimes | Usually | Always | Don’t Use | No Response |
|-----------|--------|-----------|---------|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Banking   | 10.5% (21) | 13.0% (26) | 14.0% (28) | 34.0% (68) | 34.5% (69) | 8.5% (17) |
| Shopping  | 12.5% (25) | 9.0% (18) | 16.5% (33) | 21.5% (43) | 15.5% (31) | 26.5% (53) |

Users reported that they did not take the same level of precautions on our study site as they do with other sites that handle money. Over 64% of users reported that they at least "usually" take security precautions at banking, shopping, and PayPal sites, but only 27% of users said they at least "usually" took precautions at our study website. Users more closely associated the risks at our study site with web email or social networking sites.

In users' responses to other questions, 2 users explicitly mentioned taking precautions because we had their PayPal email address. However, 14 users explicitly mentioned that they considered our study site to be low risk because they felt they had little to lose.

### 3.6 Analysis and Discussion

Our results suggest that our warnings had little impact on users' decisions, even when users had the opportunity to see warnings during the simulated attacks. We found no evidence that including warnings in registration emails helped users resist our attacks. Many users did not remember our warnings or indicated that they had little impact on their decisions during the study. Although including contextual warnings in emails seemed to improve the likelihood that a user would recall seeing them, we found no evidence that users who recalled seeing our warnings were more likely to resist the attack. Our results are consistent with a recent study by Egelman et al., which suggests that passive warnings such as ours are ineffective in helping users resist attacks [16].
