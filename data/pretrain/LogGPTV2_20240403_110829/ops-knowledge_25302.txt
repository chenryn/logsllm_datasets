User:  set of effective coping strategies is provided for a web server under DDoS attack.
Assistant: The following are some effective countermeasures against DDoS attacks: 1. Deploy DDoS defense devices: DDoS defense devices can detect traffic before attacks and filter out abnormal traffic to avoid server downtime caused by traffic overload. This device can be placed on the cloud server or local server to provide more complete protection. 2. Increased bandwidth: By increasing the network bandwidth, the server can provide greater capacity to withstand DDoS large-traffic attacks. However, increasing the bandwidth does not necessarily completely solve the DDoS attack problem, because the attacker can continue to increase the attack traffic. 3. Implement IP blocking: Use IP blacklist and blocking technology to block or restrict access to the target server from the attacker's IP address. This is an address-based defense that is effective against DDoS attacks, but can become ineffective as attackers easily change IP addresses. 4. Compress network traffic through CDN: Use CDN to cache and transmit data, and select some key areas for data transmission in a targeted manner, which can disperse the impact of DDoS attacks. This method can quickly divert attack traffic and reduce server load pressure, but it may also speed up attacks on critical information. 5. Prevent DDoS attacks: Always keep updated to keep all devices and software in the system at the latest security level. Make sure a firewall is set up on the server, and the public interface port essentially protects resources and services inside the network from being accessed. In addition, organizations can greatly improve their security by implementing multi-factor authentication measures, especially in the process of verifying enumeration to prevent attacks and access.
