Several users indicated that the attached keys encouraged
them to ﬁnd the owner, e.g., “It placed more urgency to
return it to its owner. Someone could be locked out of their
apartment/house or something, so I would rather return it
faster.” A smaller number mentioned curiosity, which appears
to dominate any sense of suspicion: “I was wondering why a

8We received 80 raw responses, but discarded 18: 6 incomplete, 1 from an
underage participant, 1 from a participant who had prior knowledge of the
experiment, and 1 user who submitted the survey 11 times (we discarded the
10 subsequent submissions). We received four more responses than consents.
However, we did not discard the responses because it was not immediately
clear that the responses were cases of abuse.
9We received 43 raw responses, but discarded 12: 7 incomplete and 5 from
participants who failed more than one attention-check question.
10Cohen’s kappa [48] for these questions ranged from 0.50 (moderate) to
0.92 (almost perfect).

jpeg picture had an html address”. In two cases, participants
admitted picking up the drive because they personally needed
a ﬂash drive. However, it is important to note that users were
likely inclined to over-report altruistic tendencies and under-
report self-interested ones.
TABLE VII: Demographics—We collect demographic infor-
mation about participants who plugged in the ﬂash drives and
ﬁnd that they do not signiﬁcantly differ from the University
population.
∗ Comparison performed using Fisher’s Exact Test instead of
the test of equal proportions.
B. Precautions
The majority of respondents (68%) explicitly stated that
they did not take any precautions for plugging in the drive or
opening any of the ﬁles. For those who did take precautions,
10 mentioned scanning the ﬁles with anti-virus software, 5 be-
lieved their operating system would protect them, 5 sacriﬁced
a computer, and 9 mentioned another form of protection
(Table VI).
During this process we also noted the following trends:
• Users underestimate the risk of visiting malicious websites.
Several even perceived the ﬁles on the ﬂash drive as being
safer because of the .html extension.
• Users intentionally use institutional resources for unsafe
activity to avoid infecting their personal computers. For
example, when questioned over safety concerns, one
respondent answered ”I sacriﬁced a university computer.”
• Users trust their OS and security software to protect them,
e.g., “I trust my macbook to be a good defense against
viruses”.
• A few users took reasonable precautions, including open-
ing the HTML ﬁle in a text editor and connecting the
drive to an ofﬂine computer.
C. Demographics
We asked participants standard SurveyMonkey demographic
questions as well as the respondent’s university afﬁliation.
Of the 62 responses to the USB survey, 41 identiﬁed as
undergraduate students, 13 as graduate students, and 7 as staff,
which does not differ from the school’s population [49] (test
of equal proportions, Fisher’s Exact Test); however we note
that no respondents were faculty members.
Participants identiﬁed as 65% male and 35% female, which is
not signiﬁcantly different than the general University population
(55% male, 45% female) [50]. This result is consistent with
prior work that found that gender does not affect infection
risk [26], [27], [35]. However, this is also simultaneously
inconsistent with results that showed that women are more
likely to fall for targeted phishing attacks [20] and men are more
likely to adopt both adaptive and risky online behaviors [32].
We ﬁnd no signiﬁcant demographic differences between the
emailed campus survey (baseline) and Illinois’ published
statistics, which suggests that the baseline survey was not
skewed towards any particular demographic (Table VII).

original study [5], along with a sample of the University of
Illinois population using the Welch two-sample unpaired t-
test.11
Our email survey found that the University of Illinois
population is more risk averse than the general population
measured by Blais and Weber in every domain. The users that
connected a USB drive are more willing to take more risk in
the health/safety, recreational, and social domains (Table VIII)
than the University of Illinois population; their appetite for
recreational risk was even greater than the (demographically-
“riskier”) Blais and Weber population. This suggests that
recreational risk taking can be used to detect susceptibility
to this class of attack.
E. Computer and Security Knowledge
We asked participants if they had “installed or re-installed
an operating system on a computer”, “conﬁgured a home
network”, or “created a web page”—three questions from
Lévesque et al. [27]—to measure general computer expertise.
We ﬁnd that there is no signiﬁcant difference between the users
who plug in a ﬂash drive and the general population (18/62 =
29% vs 9/50 = 18%, test of equal proportions, p = 0.25).
We also included questions from Egelman and Peer’s
Security Behavior Intentions Scale (SeBIS) [4], a set of
questions that measure how well end users follow well known
security advice. We show the SeBIS items with p  0.6 for all sub-scales and α > 0.7
for a majority of sub-scales.”
cItems denoted with r are reverse-scored and recoded.
A. Drive Returns
Despite instructing users that they could keep the ﬂash
drives they found, 54 (18%) of participants returned the drive
to us (Table X). Of those, 36 (67%) of the drives were never
connected to a computer. A signiﬁcant fraction (17/54 = 32%)
of the returned drives had keys attached. 11 of the remaining
drives had return address labels, 9 of which had not been
plugged into a computer. Most of the users who returned
drives to us were administrative personnel that acted as the
lost and found contact for their department (59%) or IT staff
(33%).
B. Received Email
The drives with return labels contained ten ﬁctitious names;
half of the names were women’s, half were men’s. These names
were generated from the 100 most popular ﬁrst and last names
from the state and U.S. censuses in 1993 and 2000, respectively
[54], [55]. We then generated unique Gmail accounts of the
form PI:EMAIL, where n represents a
four-digit random number, and we wrote each corresponding
name and email on six drives.
On average, each recipient
received 4.8 emails from
4.4 senders (out of a total of six drives each) after a week, all
of which stated that they drive had been found. There was no
signiﬁcant difference between male and female names.
dWe used the test of equal proportions.
TABLE X: Returned Drive Data—We compare the fractions
of drives returned to us by type versus our unlabeled control.
We also include drive opens by type for reference. Keys drives
were returned more frequently than our unlabeled control.
