### User Responses and Motivations

Several users indicated that the attached keys encouraged them to find the owner, emphasizing the urgency of the situation. For example, one user stated, "It placed more urgency to return it to its owner. Someone could be locked out of their apartment/house, so I would rather return it faster." A smaller number of users mentioned curiosity, which seemed to outweigh any sense of suspicion. One user commented, "I was wondering why a JPEG picture had an HTML address."

In two instances, participants admitted to picking up the drive because they personally needed a flash drive. However, it is important to note that users were likely to over-report altruistic tendencies and under-report self-interested ones.

### Survey Response Data

We received 80 raw responses but discarded 18: 6 incomplete, 1 from an underage participant, 1 from a participant with prior knowledge of the experiment, and 1 user who submitted the survey 11 times (we discarded the 10 subsequent submissions). We received four more responses than consents. However, we did not discard these responses because it was not immediately clear that they were cases of abuse.

For the second survey, we received 43 raw responses but discarded 12: 7 incomplete and 5 from participants who failed more than one attention-check question.

Cohen's kappa [48] for these questions ranged from 0.50 (moderate) to 0.92 (almost perfect).

### Precautions Taken

The majority of respondents (68%) explicitly stated that they did not take any precautions when plugging in the drive or opening any files. For those who did take precautions:
- 10 mentioned scanning the files with anti-virus software.
- 5 believed their operating system would protect them.
- 5 sacrificed a computer.
- 9 mentioned another form of protection (Table VI).

During this process, we noted the following trends:
- Users underestimate the risk of visiting malicious websites. Some even perceived the files on the flash drive as safer due to the .html extension.
- Users intentionally use institutional resources for unsafe activities to avoid infecting their personal computers. For example, one respondent said, "I sacrificed a university computer."
- Users trust their OS and security software to protect them, e.g., "I trust my MacBook to be a good defense against viruses."
- A few users took reasonable precautions, including opening the HTML file in a text editor and connecting the drive to an offline computer.

### Demographics

We asked participants standard SurveyMonkey demographic questions, including their university affiliation. Of the 62 responses to the USB survey:
- 41 identified as undergraduate students.
- 13 as graduate students.
- 7 as staff.

This distribution does not differ significantly from the school’s population [49] (test of equal proportions, Fisher’s Exact Test). Notably, no respondents were faculty members.

Participants identified as 65% male and 35% female, which is not significantly different from the general University population (55% male, 45% female) [50]. This result is consistent with prior work that found gender does not affect infection risk [26], [27], [35]. However, it is inconsistent with results showing that women are more likely to fall for targeted phishing attacks [20] and men are more likely to adopt both adaptive and risky online behaviors [32].

We found no significant demographic differences between the emailed campus survey (baseline) and Illinois' published statistics, suggesting the baseline survey was not skewed towards any particular demographic (Table VII).

### Risk Tolerance

Our email survey found that the University of Illinois population is more risk-averse than the general population measured by Blais and Weber in every domain. The users who connected a USB drive are more willing to take risks in the health/safety, recreational, and social domains (Table VIII) than the University of Illinois population. Their appetite for recreational risk was even greater than the (demographically-"riskier") Blais and Weber population. This suggests that recreational risk-taking can be used to detect susceptibility to this class of attack.

### Computer and Security Knowledge

We asked participants if they had "installed or re-installed an operating system on a computer," "configured a home network," or "created a web page" to measure general computer expertise. We found no significant difference between the users who plugged in a flash drive and the general population (18/62 = 29% vs 9/50 = 18%, test of equal proportions, p = 0.25).

We also included questions from Egelman and Peer’s Security Behavior Intentions Scale (SeBIS) [4], a set of questions that measure how well end-users follow well-known security advice. We show the SeBIS items with p < 0.6 for all sub-scales and α > 0.7 for a majority of sub-scales.

### Drive Returns

Despite instructing users that they could keep the flash drives they found, 54 (18%) of participants returned the drive to us (Table X). Of those, 36 (67%) of the drives were never connected to a computer. A significant fraction (17/54 = 32%) of the returned drives had keys attached. 11 of the remaining drives had return address labels, 9 of which had not been plugged into a computer. Most of the users who returned drives to us were administrative personnel acting as the lost and found contact for their department (59%) or IT staff (33%).

### Received Email

The drives with return labels contained ten fictitious names; half were women's, half were men's. These names were generated from the 100 most popular first and last names from the state and U.S. censuses in 1993 and 2000, respectively [54], [55]. We then generated unique Gmail accounts of the form PI:EMAIL, where n represents a four-digit random number, and we wrote each corresponding name and email on six drives.

On average, each recipient received 4.8 emails from 4.4 senders (out of a total of six drives each) after a week, all stating that the drive had been found. There was no significant difference between male and female names (determined using the test of equal proportions).

### Returned Drive Data

| Drive Type     | Confidential | Exams | Keys | Return Label | None |
|----------------|--------------|-------|------|--------------|------|
| Opened         | 29/58 (50%)  | 29/60 (48%) | 29/60 (48%) | 14/59 (24%) | 27/60 (45%) |

Keys drives were returned more frequently than our unlabeled control.
