### Environment
- Dubbo version: 2.7.4

### Description
When using Nacos as the registry, metadata store, and configuration center, we can pass certain parameters in the URL, such as:
```
nacos://127.0.0.1:8848?namespace=dubbo&clusterName=DEFAULT&namingLoadCacheAtStart=true
```

While some parameters are recognized, others, such as `namingLoadCacheAtStart`, are not. In my use case, the `namingLoadCacheAtStart=true` parameter is crucial because it instructs Nacos to load local cache files at startup. This helps avoid crashes in the Nacos cluster and ensures the stability of the application.

However, the latest version of Dubbo (2.7.4) does not support the `namingLoadCacheAtStart` parameter.
