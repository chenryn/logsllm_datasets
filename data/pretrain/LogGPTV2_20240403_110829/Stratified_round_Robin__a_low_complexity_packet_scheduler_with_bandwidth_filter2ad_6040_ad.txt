5.2 Bennet-Zhang fairness
The fairness measure of Bennet-Zhang (also called worst-
case fairness) is a more reﬁned notion of fairness. Rather
than comparing the relative amounts of service received by
two ﬂows fi and fj , it compares the service received by a
single ﬂow fi to the service it would receive in the ideal
case, i.e., when fi has exclusive access to an output link of
bandwidth ri
5.
Suppose a packet belonging to ﬂow fi arrives, creating
a total backlog of qi in fi’s queue. The fairness measure
of Bennet-Zhang requires a bound on the maximum time
δi that elapses before the packet is transmitted, thereby
”draining” the backlog of qi. In particular, it is desired to
bound how much δi is in excess of qi
, which is the amount
ri
of time it would take to clear a backlog of qi with an output
link of bandwidth ri. Theorem 3 gives a bound for δi.

Proof. Let t1 be the time a packet belonging to ﬂow fi

time the backlog of qi is drained. By Theorem 2, the amount

Stratiﬁed Round Robin provides a delay bound that is
proportional to the number of ﬂows N . This is not surprising
as recent lower bounds [31] suggest that a GPS-relative delay
proportional to N is impossible to avoid without incurring
at least O(log N ) complexity. The following section shows
that in the special case of a single packet, Stratiﬁed Round
Robin achieves a strictly rate-proportional delay bound.
5.3 Single packet delay bound
This section analyzes the single packet delay bound for
Stratiﬁed Round Robin, i.e., the maximum time that elapses
between the time it reaches the head of its queue, and the
time it is completely transmitted over the output link. This
is similar to the fairness measure of Bennet-Zhang, except
5This case is identical to the Generalized Processor Sharing
model.
that it deals with a backlog of a single packet. A bound is
derived by considering the maximum number of slots that
can go by before a ﬂow is assigned a slot, and the maximum
real time that elapses in any slot.

in any one slot. Then

(Single packet delay). For every ﬂow
fi, let ∆i be the maximum delay experienced by a packet
at the head of fi’s queue. Then
∆i <
12LM
ri
(11)
Proof. Suppose fi ∈ Fk. A packet reaches the head of
fi’s queue if either fi was not backlogged, or the preceding
packet was transmitted when fi was serviced in the current
slot. In either case, this packet is guaranteed to be trans-
mitted in the next slot assigned to fi. By Theorem 1, fi is
assigned a slot in every scheduling interval of Fk. Therefore
the maximum number of slots that can go by before fi is
assigned a slot again is twice the length of Fk’s scheduling
interval or 2k+1 slots. By Lemma 3, the maximum amount
of real time that elapses in any slot is
R . Therefore

Theorem 4 gives a strictly rate-proportional upper bound
for ∆i that is independent of the number of ﬂows N . This
means that Stratiﬁed Round Robin provides a guarantee
that a ﬂow fi is served within a small constant amount of
time that depends only on its reserved bandwidth and is
independent of the number of ﬂows N . To our knowledge,
this is the ﬁrst scheme of this complexity that has this prop-
erty 6 . Schedulers of comparable complexity such as DRR
and SRR can delay even a single packet by an amount that
is proportional to N . An O(log N ) scheduler like WF2Q
[2] has an optimal Bennet-Zhang bound of LM
. Stratiﬁed
ri
Round Robin has a bound that is within a multiplicative
factor of this for the single packet case.
Theorem 4 implies that Stratiﬁed Round Robin has good
asymptotic properties, but at the expense of large constant
factors (5 for fairness and 12 for delay). It is likely that a
tighter analysis could reduce these constants (this is the sub-
ject of current work). However, while the large constants are
6An interesting application of this is in the area of
proportional-share processor scheduling [4] [29], where pro-
cessor time must be allocated among N competing pro-
cesses. Stratiﬁed Round Robin not only allocates processor
time to each process in proportion to its share, but also pro-
vides a bounded response time for each process. A process is
guaranteed to be scheduled within a small constant amount
of time, independent of the other processes in the system.

not ideal for providing hard QoS guarantees, they are likely
to be the key reason for achieving the low complexity of
Stratiﬁed Round Robin. This tradeoﬀ is important because
there are lower bounds on the asymptotic performance of
low complexity schedulers [31]. For example, in the case of
Stratiﬁed Round Robin, the Bennet-Zhang fairness measure
is still proportional to N in the general case of a backlog of
packets. A challenge that remains is to design low complex-
ity schedulers that achieve optimal asymptotic properties
subject to these lower bounds, while simultaneously having
small constants that are important for providing strong QoS
guarantees.
6. SIMULATION RESULTS
We simulated the operation of Stratiﬁed Round Robin
using the ns− 2 network simulator. The simulation setup is
shown in Figure 5. There are 7 CBR ﬂows from n0 to n4 with
reserved rates ranging from 10 Kbps to 70 Kbps increasing
