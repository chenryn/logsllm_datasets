If you know how to fix the issue, make a pull request instead.
  * I tried using the `@types/styled-components` package and had problems because since of v.4.1.9 another conflicted dependency was added (@types/react-native) and conflicts with @types/node . See commit
  * I tried using the latest stable version(3.3.3333) of tsc. https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript
  * I have a question that is inappropriate for StackOverflow. (Please ask any appropriate questions there).
  * Mention the authors (see `Definitions by:` in `index.d.ts`) so they can respond.
