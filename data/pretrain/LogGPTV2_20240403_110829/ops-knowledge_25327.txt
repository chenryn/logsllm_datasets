### Project Overview

**Objective:**
The primary goal of this project is to collect, store, and analyze log data from various global systems. The log entries will be saved in a specified format (e.g., Timestamp, Log Entry, Location, Remarks) and stored in Hadoop. Additionally, the project aims to generate on-demand reports, including drill-down and drill-up capabilities.

**Details:**
- **Log Data Collection:** Log data will be collected from multiple sources worldwide.
- **Data Storage:** The collected log data will be stored in Hadoop.
- **Report Generation:** On-demand reports will be generated from the stored log data, with features like drill-down and drill-up analysis.
- **Data Volume:** Approximately 50 to 60 MB of log entries are expected per minute.

### Research and Questions

1. **Log Data Ingestion:**
   - **Current Approach:** We are currently using Apache Flume to save log entries into Hadoop.
   - **Question:** Are there any other effective alternatives to Apache Flume for log data ingestion?

2. **Report Generation:**
   - **Current Approach:** We are developing our own MapReduce (MR) programs and servlets to generate reports.
   - **Question:** Are there any open-source tools available for Hadoop data analysis that can be used to generate reports and dashboards?

### Additional Information

- **Datameer:** One potential solution is Datameer, which provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for importing various types of files and creating reports and dashboards. This tool might simplify the process of data import and report generation.

### Request for Feedback

I am currently conducting research on this project. Any additional comments or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
