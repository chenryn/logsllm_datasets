# G0069: MuddyWater

## Description
MuddyWater is an Iranian threat group primarily targeting Middle Eastern nations, with some operations extending to European and North American countries. The group's primary targets include the telecommunications, government (IT services), and oil sectors. Initially, MuddyWater's activities were linked to FIN7, but it is now believed to be a distinct group, possibly motivated by espionage.
