For developers working on large-scale software projects, such as Servo, `rustdoc` serves as a valuable tool for exploring the internal methods of a crate. However, it currently does not display non-exported (private) items. 

A potential enhancement could be the introduction of an "internal" mode that includes private items in the documentation, thereby providing a more comprehensive view of the codebase.
