ABSTRACT
Tor and I2P are well-known anonymity networks used by many
individuals to protect their online privacy and anonymity. Tor’s
centralized directory services facilitate the understanding of the
Tor network, as well as the measurement and visualization of its
structure through the Tor Metrics project. In contrast, I2P does not
rely on centralized directory servers, and thus obtaining a complete
view of the network is challenging. In this work, we conduct an
empirical study of the I2P network, in which we measure properties
including population, churn rate, router type, and the geographic
distribution of I2P peers. We find that there are currently around
32K active I2P peers in the network on a daily basis. Of these peers,
14K are located behind NAT or firewalls.
Using the collected network data, we examine the blocking re-
sistance of I2P against a censor that wants to prevent access to
I2P using address-based blocking techniques. Despite the decen-
tralized characteristics of I2P, we discover that a censor can block
more than 95% of peer IP addresses known by a stable I2P client by
operating only 10 routers in the network. This amounts to severe
network impairment: a blocking rate of more than 70% is enough to
cause significant latency in web browsing activities, while blocking
more than 90% of peer IP addresses can make the network unusable.
Finally, we discuss the security consequences of the network being
blocked, and directions for potential approaches to make I2P more
resistant to blocking.

1 INTRODUCTION
In recent years, Internet censorship and surveillance have become
prevalent [4, 13, 18, 47, 64, 69]. For this reason, anonymous commu-
nication has drawn attention from both researchers and Internet
users [10, 13, 42, 46, 69, 71, 74]. As anonymous communication net-
works grow to support more users, more anonymity and censorship
circumvention tools are becoming freely available [23]. Some of
these tools include proxy servers, Virtual Private Network (VPN)
services, the Onion Router (Tor) [10], and the Invisible Internet
Project (I2P) [74]. Tor and I2P are the most popular low-latency
anonymous communication networks, which use the onion routing
technique [56] to protect user anonymity.
Although both Tor and I2P provide similar features, there are
some major differences between them. Tor operates at the TCP
stream level, while I2P traffic can use both TCP and UDP. Tor has
a centralized architecture in which a set of directory authorities
keep track of the network, while no entity has a complete view
of the I2P network due to its decentralized nature. Every I2P peer
helps other peers to route traffic by default, while there are only
6.5K Tor routers serving more than two million users per day, as
of May 2018 [62]. As a result, while Tor is mainly designed for
latency-sensitive activities (e.g., web browsing) due to bandwidth
scarcity [45], I2P’s capacity also enables bandwidth-intensive peer-
to-peer (P2P) applications (e.g., BitTorrent) [68].
While helping users to browse the Internet anonymously, these
networks also provide hidden services (comprising the “dark web”)
in which the anonymity of both senders and receivers is preserved,
thus protecting their privacy. Because of its popularity and the
support of volunteer-based “exit nodes” to the normal Internet, Tor
has been widely used and extensively researched. On the other
hand, I2P has not been studied as comprehensively. We identify

two potential reasons I2P has been less appealing than Tor. First,
I2P’s purely distributed network architecture, which lacks any cen-
tralized directory service, makes it harder to measure. Second, the
intermittent availability of exit nodes causes I2P to operate as a
self-contained network (which only serves hidden services) most
of the time, making it less attractive to users who want to casually
browse websites on the public Internet.
In this work, we aim to fill this research gap by conducting
an empirical measurement of the I2P network, which may help
popularize I2P to both academic researchers and Internet users, and
contribute to understanding its structure and properties. With those
two goals in mind, our investigation aims to answer the following
main questions.
What is the population of I2P peers in the network? While Tor
relies on a centralized architecture for tracking its public relays,
which are indexed by a set of hard-coded authority servers, I2P is a
distributed P2P network in which no single centralized authority
can keep track of all active peers [1, 7, 21, 50, 58, 72]. Tor developers
can easily collect information about the network and even visualize
it, as part of the Tor Metrics project [41]. In contrast, there have been
very few studies attempting to measure the I2P network [19, 40, 68].
In this work, we attempt to estimate the size of the I2P network
by running up to 40 I2P nodes under different settings for network
monitoring purposes. We find that there are currently 32K active
I2P peers in the I2P network on a daily basis. The United States, Rus-
sia, England, France, Canada, and Australia contribute more than
40% of these peers. Different from prior works, we also observed
about 6K peers that are from 30 countries with poor Press Freedom
scores [48]. This is an indication that I2P is possibly being used as
an alternative to Tor in regions with heavy Internet censorship and
surveillance.
How resilient is I2P against censorship, and what is the cost of
blocking I2P? Despite the existence of many pro-privacy and anti-
censorship tools, these are often easily blocked by local Internet
authorities, thus becoming inaccessible or difficult to access by non-
tech-savvy users [12]. Hence, it is important to not only develop
censorship-resistant communication tools, but also to ensure that
they are easily accessible to end users. Due to the centralized nature
of Tor’s network architecture, it is relatively easy for a censor to
obtain a list of all public Tor routers and block them [60]. Even
hidden routers (also known as “bridges”) are often discovered and
blocked [11, 13]. Despite its decentralized design, there have still
been reported attempts to block I2P [49]. However, to the best of
our knowledge, no prior studies have analyzed how challenging
(or not) it is for a censor to block I2P access. By analyzing the data
we collected about the I2P the network, we examine the censorship
resistance of I2P using a probabilistic model. We discover that a
censor can block more than 95% of peer IP addresses known to a
stable I2P client by injecting only 10 routers into the network.
In summary, the primary contribution of this work is an empirical
measurement of the I2P network, that aims to not only improve
our understanding of I2P’s network properties, but also to assess
the vulnerability of the I2P network to address-based blocking.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives
an overall background of I2P and presents related works. As an
indispensable part of an anonymity network study, ethical consid-
erations are discussed in Section 3, where we justify the principles
to which we adhere while collecting and analyzing data for this
study. In Section 4, we explain our measurement methodology, in-
cluding machine specifications, network bandwidths, and the I2P
router types that we used to conduct our measurements. The mea-
surement results (e.g., the population of I2P peers, churn rate, and
peer distribution) of the I2P network properties are analyzed in
Section 5. Based on these network properties, we then examine the
blocking resistance of the network in Section 6, where we discover
that I2P is highly vulnerable to address-based blocking in spite of
its decentralized nature. Finally, in Sections 7 and 8, we conclude
by discussing consequences of the network being censored and
introducing potential approaches to hinder I2P censorship attempts
using address-based blocking, based on the insights that we gained
from our network measurements.
2 BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK
2.1 I2P: The Invisible Internet Project
2.1.1 Routing Mechanism. The Invisible Internet Project (I2P) [74]
is a message-oriented anonymous relay network consisting of peers
(also referred to as nodes, relays, or routers) running the I2P router
software, allowing them to communicate with each other. While
Tor [10] uses onion-routing-based [20, 56] bidirectional circuits for
communication, I2P utilizes garlic-routing-based [8, 9, 17] unidirec-
tional tunnels for incoming and outgoing messages. An I2P client
uses two types of communication tunnels: inbound and outbound.
Therefore, a single round-trip request message and its response
between two parties needs four tunnels, as shown in Figure 1.
For simplicity, each tunnel is depicted with two hops. In practice,
depending on the desired level of anonymity, tunnels can be con-
figured to comprise up to seven hops [25]. New tunnels are formed
every ten minutes.
When Alice wants to communicate with Bob, she sends out mes-
sages on her outbound tunnel. These messages head toward the
gateway router of Bob’s inbound tunnel. Alice learns the address
of Bob’s gateway router by querying a distributed network data-
base [34] (discussed in more detail in Section 2.1.2). To reply to
Alice, Bob follows the same process by sending out reply messages
on his outbound tunnel towards the gateway of Alice’s inbound
tunnel. The anonymity of both Alice and Bob is preserved since
they only know the addresses of the gateways, but not each other’s
real addresses. Note that gateways of inbound tunnels are published,
while gateways of outbound tunnels are known only by the party
who is using them.
The example in Figure 1 illustrates a case in which I2P is used as
a self-contained network, with participating peers communicating
solely with each other. However, if Bob also provides an outproxy
service, Alice can relay her traffic through Bob to connect to the
public Internet. The returned Internet traffic is then securely relayed
back to Alice by Bob via his outbound tunnels, while Alice’s identity
remains unknown to both Bob and the visited destination on the
Internet.
Similar to Tor’s onion routing, when an I2P message is sent over
