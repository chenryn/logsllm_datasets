I'm writing a new PowerShell script, and I want to make use of unicode
emojies, which are now supported by the new Windows Terminal Preview. However,
for a user running "legacy" PowerShell that doesn't support it, I do not wish
to show the unrecognized characters, and instead I would like to show him some
other text/sign.
To be more simple - I would like to know when my PS script is running in the
new Terminal and show one thing and show something else for other PS
terminals.
I have tried using `$env:TERM_PROGRAM`. If I use is inside the vscode PS
terminal it returns "vscode", but under normal PS terminal or new terminal it
returns nothing.
Any ideas?
