techniques only work at short ranges because either the device
sound must be captured directly or microphones must capture
the transmitted ultrasonic signal. Our goal is not to explore
new audio covert channels but to investigate the problem of
VA mediated exﬁltration of data by compromised computers.
Data transfer with acoustic signals has been explored in
the past [19], [21], [22], [26], [31]. Madhavapeddy et al. [22]
presented the use of Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF)
signaling for such transfer to send short messages between
devices over the phone channel. A bit rate of 20 bit/second
with DTMF across a 100-inch distance was demonstrated.
Nandakumar et al. [26] realized an acoustics-based near ﬁeld
communication (NFC) system on mobile phones. It used
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) with
subcarriers selected in range 0–22 kHz to send data. More
recently, Reaves et al. [31] investigated transmission of identity
authentication messages over the telephony channel with a
modem using Frequency Shift Keying (FSK). In contrast,
we explore DTMF encoded data transmission when audio is
played over the air from a computer to a VA, and then sent
via telephony from the VA to an attacker controlled remote
system.
In this paper, we assume that data is exﬁltrated from a
malware infected computer close to a VA. There is consider-
able research in the area of malware infection, detection and
remediation (see survey papers such as [7], [12]). One or more
of the infection vectors can be used by malicious actors to
infect machines that store sensitive data. We do not discuss
details of how such infections are accomplished but focus
on how the malware can utilize the speaker on the infected
machine and a VA to exﬁltrate sensitive data.
III. THREAT MODEL
We explore attacks in which an attacker’s goal is to locate
computers in home or ofﬁce settings that store sensitive data
and then exﬁltrate such data via nearby VAs. To launch such an
attack at scale, the attacker must be able to infect large number
of computers and take control of them via malware that can be
used to issue commands to VAs. Malware infection of victim
computers can be accomplished using a number of techniques,
including compromised webpages, spam email clicks, social
engineering or by exploiting software vulnerabilities. Once a
computer is under control of the malware, the malware must
issue a series of audio commands via available device speakers
to activate a nearby VA. Once this is done, it plays audio via
computer speakers that encodes the data and the data then is
transmitted to an attacker controlled system.
Although we assume that the attacker is able to compromise
computers via tricking users, we do not require that
the
attacker is able to overcome host or network defenses that
are deployed to protect transfer of sensitive data to unautho-
rized hosts. This is reasonable for well defended networks in
enterprise environments but home networks may not be as
well secured. Thus, our threat model considers the case where
malware uses computer speakers and VAs as an alternate path
to exﬁltrate data to evade detection by network defenses,.
Since the data is encoded as audio, one question is if a human,
who is in the vicinity of the infected computer or VA, will
hear such audio and be alarmed. Although past research has
demonstrated that commands to VAs can be hidden or be
made inaudible (this is possible through adversarial example
attacks [5], [6], [40] or audio processing [1], [34], [41]), it
is not known if this can be done with audio that encodes
arbitrary data which is played over speakers that are available
on common computers. Furthermore, we need to encode data
in audio that can be transmitted with high accuracy over a
voice phone call connection.
A person who hears sound coming from a computer will
become suspicious when the sound is due to audio encoded
exﬁltration of data. Ideally, we can encode the data in audio
frequencies that are inaudible to humans using modulation
with an ultrasonic carrier but as discussed earlier,
this is
not possible with ordinary computer speakers. Instead, we
consider a threat model that seeks to achieve near inaudibility
based on the following observation. Most adults cannot hear
high frequencies even when they are close to the sound source.
For example, an average adult can only hear frequencies below
16 kHz due to natural hearing loss with age. Studies have
shown that frequencies above 15 kHz mixed with other sounds
are not consciously recognized by listeners [27]. We explore if
data can be exﬁltrated stealthily when modulated with a very
high frequency carrier (over 15 kHz). In fact, as expected, we
did ﬁnd a tradeoff between inaudibility and the accuracy with
which the audio can be transmitted via computer speakers.
We can increase the carrier frequency to 20 kHz to make it
inaudible to nearly everyone at lower transmission accuracy or
we can choose a frequency that most people would not hear
to increase accuracy.
A person could notice an inaudible command either due to
an audio response generated by the VA or a visual indicator
(e.g., blinking light) that may appear when a request
is
processed. In some VAs, it is possible to lower the volume
of an audio response or mute it (muting is not possible on
Amazon Echo). Also, a visual indicator could go unnoticed
or may not raise a suspicion because it may be a frequent
occurrence. Our threat model does not address how to evade
detection via such indicators that could be noticed by a person
near a VA when it is used to exﬁltrate data.
Our threat model makes several assumptions that could
impact the practical feasibility and effectiveness of an attack.
For example, a computer may not be sufﬁciently close to
a targeted VA or there may be lots of background noise.
These could limit
the ability of an infected computer to

successfully issue a command and transmit data. However,
because the attack can be launched at scale, similar to other
mass cyberatatcks such as phishing, we do not claim that all
or speciﬁc target VAs could be exploited. An attack may be
effective against only a small fraction of the VAs but due to
the scale of the attack, this could still be a serious problem
for many users. Also, increased sophistication will be required
(e.g., noise level detection, repeated attempts tec.) for targeted
attacks.
IV. DATA TRANSMISSION CHANNEL CHARACTERIZATION
We explore the use of the phone call functionality provided
by VAs like Amazon Echo to transmit data to a remote host. To
do this, we need to better understand the characteristics of this
transmission channel between the source and target computers.
As shown in Figure 1, data is ﬁrst encoded in an audio ﬁle at
a compromised source host and this audio is modulated with
a high frequency sound carrier and then transmitted via the
computer speaker and received by VA’s microphones. Once
the VA captures the audio, a phone call is used to transmit the
data to the remote host. Such a call relies on a Voice-Over-IP
(VoIP) channel to the cloud and then a gateway that sends the
voice over a telecommunications network to the end system
where the voice is recorded.
The phone channel behavior depends on codecs and sam-
pling rates, protocols used for transmitting the audio packets,
and other factors such as noise cancellation and packet loss
concealment. Although information about audio codecs and
transport protocols is available, characterization of the end-to-
end transmission channel that starts with a computer speaker
and ends with the called phone number is challenging because
we have no information about
telecommunication carriers
and gateways that are involved in supporting a call. Due
to this, we take a blackbox empirical analysis approach to
study this channel to understand its characteristics that are
relevant to transmission of data with audio. In particular, we
measure the frequency response of the channel, its transport
protocol behavior, and VA features that handle voice capture
and microphone response to modulation carrier frequencies.
As mentioned earlier, in our experiments, we chose Amazon
Echo Plus as the VA because it can be made to dial a
phone number directly by saying, Alexa, call (123)-456-789.
We place the Echo Plus close to a MacBook Pro, playing
audio through its speakers. The other endpoint of the phone
call channel
is a Google Voice number. We record calls
coming to the Google Voice number. The audio recordings are
downloaded and data is reconstructed from these recordings.
Unlike some of the earlier attacks that have been reported on
VAs, in our setup a remote attacker can easily get a Google
Voice number and download call recordings coming to it.
Thus, data can be exﬁltrated over the audio channel enabled
by the VA without being in physical proximity of the targeted
computer and VA.

Fig. 2. Sound Level Distribution of Received Audio at Various Frequencies.
To describe signal strength in this paper, we use dB Full Scale (dBFS), which
is based on the ratio of the digital signal level to the maximum possible signal
level [24]. This scale is different from the air pressure based dB scale used
to describe sound loudness.
A. Phone Call Channel Frequency Response
Our data transmission relies on a phone channel, which is
typically used to transmit human voice over the frequency
range of 300 to 3400 Hz [32]. To measure if our transmission
channel has a similar frequency range, we play a frequency
scan audio and measure the sound level of received audio. In
Figure 2, the received sound level goes above -60 dB after
about 260 Hz, and drops below -60 dB at 3400 Hz, which
provides good quality for normal phone call that carries the
audio of people talking. While the phone call channel provides
limited sound level at lower frequency, it drops sharply after
3000 Hz, and becomes nearly undetectable after 4000 Hz.
Thus, for transmitting data as audio, we must operate within
the voiceband (300–3400 Hz). In theory, the bit rate for data
transfer over the phone channel can reach 33600 bit per
second [33], but only through a well designed modem. In
our case, the audio is played by the speakers on a laptop
and captured by Echo Plus microphones over the air. Also,
the quality of the audio transmitted by the computer speakers
could be degraded with environmental noise. Thus, the bit
rate that our phone call channel can support for data transfer
is signiﬁcantly lower. Although this would make bulk data
transfer challenging, passwords, keys, bank account or social
security numbers and other limited size data can be transmitted
over such a channel.
B. Voice Assistant Audio Processing Features
VAs are built for taking people’s commands and responding
to them. Unlike usual cellphones which are only equipped
with microphones on the top and bottom, a VA can utilize
multiple microphones as a microphone array. For example,
there are seven microphones in the top board of Amazon
Echo Plus, six on the perimeter and one in the center. A
microphone array can help the VA determine the direction
of incoming voice based on the difference in the arrival times
at each microphone. When audio signals come from many
directions, Echo Plus has its own algorithm to distinguish
human voice from background noise and then focus in the
direction of human voice, resulting in cancellation of noise. In
our experiments, we can observe two interesting adjustments
Echo Plus applies to its audio recordings. First, Amazon
Echo Plus tends to adjust the volume to a moderate level

as time goes. From Figure 3a, while white noise sound level
played from laptop is stable, the maximum sound level of the
recording is lowered automatically by the device. This may be
an adjustment scheme in case of a sudden burst of sound. Also,
the sound must reach a certain level to get the attention of
Amazon Echo. We explore this by conducting an experiment
that starts by transmitting audio with no noise at ﬁrst and then
same audio is played with noise. This is repeated to see the
activation of the microphones. In Figure 3b, we ﬁrst show the
recorded audio with no noise followed by including the noise.
At ﬁrst, we play our encoded audio from 100 inches away
while there is no noise playing. The sound level is too low
to get the attention of Amazon Echo Plus. When we play a
loud noise with the same encoded audio, the combined sound
energy level reaches the threshold and the microphones are
activated. We decode the recorded audios which encode the
same message. In the case when there is no noise, we could not
reconstruct the message. In contrast, the audio with the noise
has most of information in it. Although somewhat surprising,
this observation is consistent with past research results that the
VA is able to understand degraded quality voice commands
that are not intelligible for humans. For call audio recorded at
the receiving end, we also found that Amazon Echo Plus does
not ﬁlter out noise from the transmitted audio which was the
case when we directly recorded the audio on a cellphone.

C. VA Microphone Response to Very High Frequency Sound
Very High Frequency Sound (VHFS) is the sound in
frequency range 13.5–20 kHz [13]. Sound beyond 20 kHz,
referred to as ultrasound, is inaudible to humans. In [41],
Zhang et al. took advantage of ultrasound modulation and the
nonlinearity of microphones to send inaudible commands to
VAs. They used high quality speakers to transmit ultrasound
frequencies. Since our threat model assumes a remote attacker,
we only assume speakers that are available in PCs or laptops.

the original audio and recorded audio. In the recoding, f1 and f2 were
demodulated out while frequencies beyond about 4000 Hz was ﬁltered out.
While these ordinary speakers cannot produce ultrasound at a
signiﬁcant energy level, they can generate loud VHFS. If we
can modulate the tones with carrier frequency beyond 15 kHz,
which is difﬁcult to hear for most adults [8], the modulated
sound will likely not raise an alert when people are near the
computer. Our experiments revealed this to be the case when
a person is not right next to the computer speakers.
The inherent nonlinearity of VA microphones results in
demodulation which can be modeled as follows [41]:
sout(t) = Asin(t) +Bs 2
in(t),
(1)
where sin(t) is the input signal, sout(t) is the output signal,
and A and B are gains for corresponding terms. In our scheme,
a two-frequency tone is used to encode binary data (see
Section V). We can formulate the original signal as:
m(t) = sin(2πf1t) + sin(2πf2t),
(2)
where f1 and f2 are the two frequencies. Let the carrier
frequency to be fc >> 3400 Hz. We modulate m(t) on fc.
Amplitude modulation gives us:
