User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Is it normal to get hundreds of break-in attempts per day? I just checked my server's /var/log/auth.log and found that I'm getting over 500 failed password/break-in attempt notifications per day! My site is small, and its URL is obscure. Is this normal? Should I be taking any measures?

Assistant: In today's internet this is quite normal sadly. There are hordes of botnets trying to login to each server they find in whole IP networks. Typically, they use simple dictionary attacks on well-known accounts (like root or certain applications accounts).

The attack targets are not found via Google or DNS entries, but the attackers just try every IP address in a certain subnet (e.g. of known root-server hosting companies). So it doesn't matter that your URL (hence the DNS entry) is rather obscure.

That's why it is so important to:


disallow root-login in SSH (howto)
use strong passwords everywhere (also in your web applications)
for SSH, use public-key authentication if possible and disable password-auth completely (howto)


Additionally, you can install fail2ban which will scan the authlog and if it finds a certain amount of failed login attempts from an IP, it will proceed to add that IP to /etc/hosts.deny or iptables/netfilter in order to lock out the attacker for a few minutes.

In addition to the SSH attacks, it is also becoming common to scan your webserver for vulnerable web-applications (some blogging apps, CMSs, phpmyadmin, etc.). So make sure to keep those up-to-date and securely configured too!
