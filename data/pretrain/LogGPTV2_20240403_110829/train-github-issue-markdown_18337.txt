### Source code
**Config file**
    // playwright.config.ts
    import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';
    export default defineConfig({
      projects: [
        {
          name: 'chromium',
          reporter: [
            ["html"]
          ],
          use: {
            headless: false, //Running this headless decreases the speed of the tests by 5-6x
            viewport: { width: 1280, height: 720 },
            video: "on",
            screenshot: "on",
            trace: "on",
          },
    },
        },
    });
**Steps**
Running a simple test on v1.29.2 creates a snapshot, a trace and a video.  
Since version 1.30.0 the exact same code won't create the video anymore.  
The latest version 1.33.0 still won't create a video.
**Expected**
Video is created on version 1.30.0 and later
**Actual**
No video since version 1.29.2 (latest version where it's working).
