User:  Based on the following information, design a high-availability load balancing system and select a suitable load balancing algorithm. The load balancing system needs to support 10,000 concurrent connections, and needs to process 100 requests per second. At the same time, the system should have high availability, and the failure of any node should not affect the normal operation of the system.
Assistant: Designing a high-availability load balancing system includes the following steps: Step 1: Select a load balancing algorithm suitable for the application scenario For this scenario, you can choose a load balancing algorithm based on round robin, because the round robin algorithm is in the case of uniform load distribution, It can ensure that the distribution of requests on each node is relatively balanced. For example, with 10 nodes, each node is allocated 1000 concurrent connections. Step 2: Design the node architecture Use a high-availability architecture, that is, an active-standby architecture, and perform state synchronization between the active node and the standby node to achieve failover. After the master node fails, the standby node automatically takes over to ensure the continuous and stable operation of the system. It can be implemented by using virtualized cluster technology, such as VMware HA cluster, Hyper-V cluster, or open source Keepalived software. Step 3: Adjust the server parameters for TCP/IP tuning, such as modifying the parameters of the TCP protocol stack, optimizing the read and write efficiency of the file system, adjusting network device parameters, etc., to improve the concurrent processing capability of the server. Step 4: Deploy load balancing software Select a mature load balancing software, such as LVS, Nginx, HAProxy, etc., and deploy it on the active and standby nodes to achieve load balancing and request distribution. It is recommended to use open source software, because open source software has the advantages of code transparency, customization, community support, etc., and is also more economical. Step 5: Perform a stress test Perform a load test to ensure that the system can support 10,000 concurrent connections and 100 requests per second, and check the stability and availability of the system. Stress testing tools, such as Apache JMeter, LoadRunner, etc., can be used during the test. In short, the design of a high-availability load balancing system needs to consider many aspects such as algorithm selection, node architecture, server parameters, load balancing software, and stress testing. Through comprehensive consideration, the stability and availability of the system are guaranteed.
