### Confusion
the code below create a `connectionMonitor` instance, but `Start` method seems
not called
    @Override
        protected  T doRefer(Class serviceType, URL url) throws RpcException {
            if (connectionMonitor == null) {
                connectionMonitor = new ConnectionMonitor();
            }
          ...
        }
