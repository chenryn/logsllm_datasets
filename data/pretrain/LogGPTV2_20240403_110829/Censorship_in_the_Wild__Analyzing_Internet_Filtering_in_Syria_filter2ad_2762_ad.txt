291Category-based Filtering. According to Blue Coat’s documenta-
tion [1], proxies can associate a category to each request (in the
cs-categories ﬁeld), based on the corresponding URL, and this cate-
gory can be used in the ﬁltering rules. In the set of censored requests,
we identify only two categories: a default category (named “unavail-
able" or "none", depending on the proxy server), and a custom
category (named “Blocked sites; unavailable" or “Blocked sites").
The custom category targets speciﬁc Facebook pages with a pol-
icy_redirect policy, accounts for 1,924 requests, and is discussed in
detail in Section 6. All the other URLs (allowed or denied) are cate-
gorized to the default category, which is subject to a more general
censorship policy, and captures the vast majority of the censored re-
quests. The censored requests in the default category consist mostly
of policy_denied with a small portion (0.21% either PROXIED or
DENIED) of policy_redirect exceptions. We next investigate the
policy applied within the default category.
String-based Filtering. The ﬁltering process is also based on par-
ticular strings included in the requested URL. In fact, the string-
based ﬁltering only relies on URL-related ﬁelds, speciﬁcally cs-host,
cs-uri-path and cs-uri-query, which fully characterize the request.
The proxies’ ﬁltering process is performed using a simple string-
matching engine that detects any blacklisted substring in the URL.
We now aim to recover the list of strings that have been used to
ﬁlter requests in our dataset. We expect that a string used for censor-
ship should only be found in the set of censored requests and never
in the set of allowed ones (for this purpose, we consider PROXIED
requests separately from OBSERVED requests, since they do not
necessarily indicate an allowed request, even when no exception
is logged). In order to identify these strings, we use the following
iterative approach: (1) Let C be the set of censored URLs and A the
set of allowed URLs; (2) Manually identify a string w appearing
frequently in C; (3) Let NC and NA be the number of occurrences
of w in C and A, respectively; (4) If NC >> 1 and NA = 0 then re-
move from C all requests containing w, add w to the list of censored
strings, and go to step 2.
To mitigate selection of strings that are unrelated to the censor-
ship decision during the manual string identiﬁcation (step 2), we
took a conservative approach by only considering non-ambiguous
requests. For instance, we select simple requests, e.g., HTTP GET
new-syria.com/, which only contains a domain name and has
an empty path and an empty query ﬁeld. Thus, we are sure that the
string new-syria.com is the source of the censorship.
URL-based Filtering. Using the iterative process described above,
we identify a list of 105 “suspected” domains, for which no request
is allowed. Table 7 presents the top-10 domains in the list, according
to the number of censored requests. We further categorized each
domain in the list and show in Table 8 the top-10 categories accord-
ing to the number of censored requests. Clearly, there is a heavy
censorship of Instant Messaging software, as well as news, public
forums, and user-contributed streaming media sites.
Keyword-based Filtering. We also identify ﬁve keywords that
trigger censorship when found in the URL (cs-host, cs-path and cs-
query ﬁelds): proxy, hotspotshield, ultrareach, israel, and ultrasurf.
We report the corresponding number of censored, allowed, and prox-
ied requests in Table 9. Four of them are related to anti-censorship
technologies and one refers to Israel. Note that a large number of
requests containing the keyword proxy are actually related to seem-
ingly “non sensitive” content, e.g., online ads content, tracking com-
ponents or online APIs, but are nonetheless blocked. For instance,
the Google toolbar API invokes a call to /tbproxy/af/query,
which can be found on the google.com domain, and is unrelated to
anti-censorship software. Nevertheless, this element accounts for

each proxy (using Cosine Similarity), we refer to the extended
version of the paper [7].
5.3 Denied vs. Redirected Trafﬁc
Requests are censored in one of two ways: they are either denied
or redirected. If a request triggers a policy_denied exception, the
requested page is not served to the client. Upon triggering pol-
icy_redirect, the request is redirected to another URL. For these
requests, we only have information from the x-exception-id ﬁeld (set
to policy_redirect) and the s-action ﬁeld (set to tcp_policy_redirect).
The policy_redirect exception is raised for a small number of hosts
– 11 in total. As reported in Table 6, the most common URLs are
upload.youtube.com and Facebook-owned domains.
Note that the redirection should trigger an additional request from
the client to the redirected URL immediately after policy_redirect is
raised. However, we found no trace of a secondary request coming
right after (within a 2-second window). Thus, we conclude that
the secondary URL is either hosted on a website that does not
require to go through the ﬁltering proxies (most likely, this site is
hosted in Syria) or that the request is processed by proxies other
than those in the dataset. Since the destination of the redirection
remains unknown, we do not know whether or not redirections point
to different pages, depending on the censored request.
5.4 Category, String, and IP-based Filtering
We now study the three main triggers of censorship decisions:
URL categories, strings, and IP addresses.

4.85% of the censored requests in the Dsample dataset. Likewise,
the keyword proxy is also included in some online social networks’
advertising components (see Section 6).
IP-based censorship. We now focus on understanding whether
some requests are censored based on IP address. To this end, we
look at the requests for which the cs-host ﬁeld is an IPv4 address and
notice that some of the URLs of censored requests do not contain
any meaningful information except for the IP address. As previously
noted, censorship can be done at a country level, e.g., for Israel,
as all .il domains are blocked. Thus, we consider the possibility
of ﬁltering trafﬁc with destination in some speciﬁc geographical
regions, based on the IP address of the destination host.
We construct DIP v4, which includes the set of requests (from
Df ull) for which the cs-host ﬁeld is an IPv4 address. We geo-
localize each IP address in DIP v4 using the Maxmind GeoIP
database.9 We then introduce, for each identiﬁed country, the cor-
responding censorship ratio, i.e., the number of censored requests
over the total number of requests to this country. Table 10 presents
the censorship ratio for each country in DIP v4. Israel is by far the
country with the highest censorship ratio, suggesting that it might
be subject to an IP-based censorship.
