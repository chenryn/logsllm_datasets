as Network Condition ID 4, the app-response times for TCP
over WiFi (shown as “TCP-WiFi” in Figure 18) and TCP over
LTE (shown as “TCP-LTE” in Figure 18) are 7.2 seconds and
2.8 seconds, respectively. In this case, using LTE can reduce
the app response time by 2.6x.
2. Using MPTCP does not provide much improvement for the
short-ﬂow dominated app pattern. For instance, in Network
Condition 1, MPTCP-Coupled-LTE and MPTCP-Decoupled-
LTE have app response times of 5.3 and 4.0, respectively.
Compared to TCP over LTE, these MPTCP schemes only
reduce the app response time by 4% and 15%, much smaller
improvements than the 2x improvement seen when using TCP
over WiFi compared to TCP over LTE.
In summary, Figure 18 shows that the choice of network for the
primary subﬂow has a strong impact on app response time. This
result is consistent with the results we show in Section 3.5.
We also study the extent to which app response times can be
reduced if we had access to an optimal network selection algorithm:
an oracle that knew the right network to use, given a particular
congestion control strategy (coupled vs decoupled) and another
oracle that knew the right congestion control strategy to use given
a particular choice for the network used by the primary subﬂow.
Figure 19 shows the app-response time with different oracle schemes,
averaged across all 20 network conditions and normalized by the
app-response time with single-path TCP over WiFi (the default on
Android today). The oracle schemes are:
1. Single-Path-TCP Oracle: Uses single-path TCP and knows
which network minimizes app response time.
2. Decoupled-MPTCP Oracle: Uses MPTCP decoupled conges-

where WiFi has a much higher TCP throughput than LTE, and Net-
work Condition IDs 3 and 4 represent places where LTE outperforms
WiFi. We observe that:
1. Using MPTCP helps to reduce app response-time. For exam-
ple, at Network Condition 1, when using single-path TCP, the
app response time is 10 seconds for WiFi and 15 seconds for
LTE. When using MPTCP, the app response time is 5 seconds.
2. Selecting the proper network is important: for example, at
Network Condition ID 2, the app response time for MPTCP-
Coupled-WiFi is 8 seconds, but if LTE is used for the primary
ﬂow, response time increases to 14 seconds.
3. Selecting the proper congestion control algorithm also affects
app response time. For example, at Network Condition ID 1,
when using LTE for the primary subﬂow, the app response
time for coupled congestion control is 4 seconds, while the re-
sponse time with decoupled congestion control is 13 seconds.
In Figure 21, we can see that:
1. MPTCP Oracles reduce the app response time by up to 50%,
while the Single-Path-TCP Oracle only reduces app response
time by 42%. So using MPTCP can help improve performance
for “long-ﬂow dominated” apps.
2. For MPTCP Oracles, both selecting the proper network for the
primary ﬂow and selecting the appropriate congestion control
can reduce the normalized app response time by about 50%,
implying that both mechanisms are almost equally beneﬁcial
to “long-ﬂow dominated” apps.
6. RELATED WORK
We discuss related work under two headings: prior work compar-
ing WiFi with cellular network performance and Multi-Path TCP.
6.1 WiFi-Cellular Comparison
Several prior papers compare cellular network performance with
WiFi. Sommers et al. [20] analyzed crowd-sourced data from
SpeedTest.net. Each data sample represents one run of a TCP
upload/download test triggered by a mobile phone user, when the
phone is connected to the Internet through either WiFi or a cellular
network. We also collect our data in a crowd-sourced manner. How-
ever, our mobile app, Cell vs WiFi, measures both WiFi and cellular
network performance on the same device at (almost) the same time.
Thus, our dataset reﬂects the performance difference observed from
a single device at almost the same time. Deshpande et al. [8] mea-
sured both 3G and WiFi performance simultaneously using a single
device, but their measurement was focused on a vehicular setting
and they only measured 3G, not LTE. Our dataset focuses on LTE
measurements instead. In our app, we used an activity-recognition
API provided by Google [1], which shows that most of our measure-
ments happen when users are still. Moreover, our data is collected
in a crowd-sourced manner, allowing it to capture a wide diversity
of conditions.
6.2 Multi-Path TCP
Multipath TCP (MPTCP) [21], and its recent implementation
in iOS 7 [13] allow a single TCP connection to use multiple paths.
MPTCP provides TCP’s reliable, in-order bytestream abstraction
while taking advantage of multiple paths for increased through-
put and fault tolerance. Previous work has looked at MPTCP in a
mobile context: Raiciu et al. studied mobility with MPTCP [19].
Pluntke et al. designed a scheduler that picks radio interfaces with
a view to reduce mobile energy consumption [18]. Paasch et al.
proposed different MPTCP modes to be used by mobile devices
for Mobile/WiFi handover [16]. Barlow-Bignell et al. [4] studied
MPTCP performance in the presence of WiFi interference where

tion control and knows which network to use for the primary
subﬂow to minimize app response time.
3. Coupled-MPTCP Oracle: Uses MPTCP coupled congestion
control and knows which network to use for the primary sub-
ﬂow to minimize app response time.
4. MPTCP-WiFi-Primary Oracle: Uses MPTCP with WiFi for
primary subﬂow and knows which congestion-control algo-
rithm to use to minimize app response time.
5. MPTCP-LTE-Primary Oracle: Uses MPTCP with LTE for pri-
mary subﬂow and knows which congestion-control algorithm
to use to minimize app response time.
We can see in Figure 19 that the 50% reduction in app response
time with Single-Path-TCP Oracle is the most substantial, while
the reductions with the MPTCP Oracles range from 15% to 35%.
This suggests that MPTCP does not reduce app response time as
signiﬁcantly as selecting the right network for single-path TCP does.
5.2 Long-ﬂow Dominated App Replay
Figures 20 and 21 show emulation results for the long-ﬂow dom-
inated trafﬁc pattern, using the same data analysis methods and
oracles as used in the previous subsection.

other if they transmitted packets simultaneously. Closest to our work
is the work of Chen et al., who measured MPTCP performance over
cellular networks and WiFi [6]. Their measurement focuses on using
different number of subﬂows, and ﬁne-grained statistics, such as
out-of-order delivery and round trip times. Instead, our focus is on
studying the choice of networks for the primary subﬂow, the choice
of congestion-control modes, MPTCP’s energy consumption, and
MPTCP’s effect on higher-level metrics such as ﬂow completion
times and app-response times.
7. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
We presented a measurement study of single-path TCP and MPTCP
over LTE and WiFi networks. For single-path TCP, we found that
LTE outperforms WiFi 40% of the time – a higher fraction than
one might expect at ﬁrst sight. We also ﬁnd that MPTCP offers no
appreciable beneﬁt over TCP for shorter ﬂows, but it does improve
performance for longer ﬂows. For MPTCP, we found that, especially
for short ﬂows, it is crucial to select the correct network for the
primary subﬂow. For long ﬂows, it is equally important to select the
proper congestion control algorithm. To understand how TCP and
MPTCP over LTE and WiFi can affect mobile app performance, we
analyzed mobile apps’ trafﬁc patterns and categorized apps as either
short-ﬂow dominated or long-ﬂow dominated. For each category, we
emulated app trafﬁc patterns and the results we observed match our
MPTCP measurement ﬁndings.
Our ﬁndings also bring up new research questions: how can we
automatically decide when to use single path TCP and when to use
MPTCP? How should we decide which network to use for TCP, or
which network to use for a subﬂow with MPTCP? We think these are
non-trivial questions due to the high mobility of devices and rapidly-
changing network conditions. Also, with energy consumption being
a major concern for mobile devices, how can we make the decisions
when trying to minimize energy consumption? We plan to explore
each of these future directions.
