**Reachability and Policy Unit Extraction**

To ensure that a set of destination addresses is reached, each rectangle in the reachability matrix represents the reachability set for a contiguous sequence of IP addresses. In practice, representing these sets may require many more rules, but we use ACL optimization techniques [1, 6] to minimize the number of non-overlapping rules. Our current implementation optimizes the ACLs to improve runtime and space requirements.

**Algorithm: EXTRACTPOLICYUNITS (SRSMatrix)**

1. **Initialization:**
   - Assume each SRS is represented using an ACL.
   - For each rule in the SRS, initialize `srcticks` and `dstticks` lists to empty.

2. **Populate and Order Ticks:**
   - Populate `srcticks` with the start and end source IP addresses from the rule.
   - Order the addresses in `srcticks` in ascending numeric order.
   - Populate `dstticks` with the start and end destination IP addresses from the rule.
   - Order the addresses in `dstticks` in ascending numeric order.

3. **Create Subunit Matrix:**
   - Initialize an empty subunit matrix with dimensions based on the number of elements in `srcticks` and `dstticks`.
   - For each element `(si, dj)` in the subunit matrix, set a value of 1 if there is a rule in any SRS that permits a superset of the packet space defined by `(si, si+1) Ã— (dj, dj+1)`.

4. **Coalesce Subunits:**
   - For each `si` in the first dimension of the subunit matrix, coalesce all subunits in a bucket into a policy unit.
   - Generate a `keystring` by hashing the `dj` values for which `(si, dj) = 1`.
   - Insert the subunit into a hashtable using the `keystring`.

**Policy Subunits and Reachability**

Policy subunits are projections of the rectangles onto the x-axis, representing maximal contiguous sequences of addresses within a source subnet that have identical reachability to the rest of the network. This decomposition increases the number of columns (and potentially rows) in the SRS matrix, transforming it into a subunit matrix. Each column in the subunit matrix corresponds to a policy subunit within a subnet.

**Example:**
- From three columns in the original SRS matrix, we obtain a decomposed subunit matrix with seven columns.
- The single column corresponding to source subnet B is decomposed into four columns.

**Extracting Policy Units:**
- Coalesce policy subunits that have the same reachability profile, i.e., they can reach the same set of destination addresses.
- In Figure 5, the first policy subunit within source subnet A, the first policy subunit within source subnet B, and the only policy subunit for source subnet C are coalesced into a single policy unit.

**Empirical Study**

We applied our technique for mining policy units to router configuration data from five production networks: two private corporate networks (Enet-1 and Enet-2) and three university networks (Univ-1, Univ-2, and Univ-3). Communication between hosts is restricted using a mix of control and data plane mechanisms at both layer-3 and layer-4. Three networks employed VLANs.

**Study Goals:**
1. Validate that policy units can be automatically extracted from network configurations.
2. Show that policy units reveal useful information about the policies implemented in the network.
3. Catalog patterns used by enterprise networks in defining their network-wide policy.
4. Provide insights on how operators can use policy units when reasoning about network configurations.

**Network Properties:**
- Table 1 summarizes the properties of the studied networks, including the number of routers, subnets, policy units, and IP addresses.
- The number of policy units is much less than the number of subnets, indicating that policy units concisely summarize the reachability policies.
- There is no clear correlation between the number of policy units and the network size, as seen in the diversity of reachability policies across different networks.

**Classes of Networks:**
- Policy-lite networks (Univ-1, Univ-2, Enet-1) implement 1 or 2 policy units.
- Policy-heavy networks (Univ-3, Enet-2) implement 14 and 40 policy units, respectively.

**Structure of Policies:**
- Figure 6 examines the structure of policy units within each network, showing the distribution of end-points and how they are spread across the network.
- In policy-lite networks, each policy unit spans over 50% of the routers in the network.

**Conclusion:**
- The study reveals the diversity of reachability policies in modern enterprise networks and highlights the utility of policy units in summarizing and understanding network configurations.
