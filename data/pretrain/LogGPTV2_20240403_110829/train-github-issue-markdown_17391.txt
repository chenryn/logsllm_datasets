**Current behavior**  
Currently if you return a new Date() from a getter into an ngModel it freezes
up the browser.
**Expected behavior**  
That it would not cause an infinite loop
**Minimal reproduction of the problem with instructions**  
have a getter method that returns a new Date() and put into an ngModel;

**What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**  
to be able to use a generated Date in ngModel.
