**Current Behavior**
When a getter that returns `new Date()` is used in an `ngModel`, it causes the browser to freeze.

**Expected Behavior**
The usage of a getter returning `new Date()` in an `ngModel` should not result in an infinite loop or cause the browser to freeze.

**Steps to Reproduce the Issue**
1. Create a getter method that returns `new Date()`.
2. Bind this getter to an `ngModel` in your Angular template.
3. Observe the browser freezing due to an infinite loop.

**Motivation for Changing the Behavior**
This change would allow developers to use dynamically generated dates within `ngModel` without causing performance issues or browser freezes.
