It seems like you are encountering an issue with the `django-admin` command not being recognized after installing Django on your Mac OS. This is likely due to the fact that the location of the `django-admin` script is not included in your system's PATH. Hereâ€™s how you can resolve this and successfully create a new Django project:

1. **Verify Django Installation:**
   - First, ensure that Django has been installed correctly. You can do this by running:
     ```bash
     pip show django
     ```
   - If Django is not listed, try reinstalling it using:
     ```bash
     pip install django
     ```

2. **Locate the `django-admin` Script:**
   - The `django-admin` script is usually located in the `bin` directory within the site-packages of your Python environment. You can find its exact location by running:
     ```bash
     python -m django --version
     ```
   - If this command works, it means `django-admin` is available but not in your PATH.

3. **Add `django-admin` to Your PATH:**
   - Find the path to the `django-admin` script. It might be something like `/usr/local/bin/django-admin` or inside a virtual environment.
   - Add this path to your system's PATH variable. You can do this by editing your shell profile file (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, etc.). For example, if you are using `zsh` (default in macOS Catalina and later), open the `.zshrc` file:
     ```bash
     nano ~/.zshrc
     ```
   - Add the following line to the file, replacing `/path/to/django-admin` with the actual path you found:
     ```bash
     export PATH="/path/to/django-admin:$PATH"
     ```
   - Save the file and exit the editor. Then, apply the changes by running:
     ```bash
     source ~/.zshrc
     ```

4. **Create a New Django Project:**
   - Now, you should be able to use the `django-admin` command. Try creating a new project again:
     ```bash
     django-admin startproject mysite
     ```

If you still encounter issues, consider using a virtual environment to manage your project dependencies. This can help avoid conflicts with other packages and ensure a clean setup.

To set up a virtual environment:
1. Install `virtualenv` if you haven't already:
   ```bash
   pip install virtualenv
   ```
2. Create a new virtual environment:
   ```bash
   virtualenv venv
   ```
3. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
4. Install Django within the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   pip install django
   ```
5. Create your new Django project:
   ```bash
   django-admin startproject mysite
   ```

This should resolve the issue and allow you to start your new Django project successfully.
