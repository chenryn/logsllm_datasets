routine 
In order to implement the functionalities of the receiver, 
we 
called 
ReceiverHandler()  (line  8).  Since  it  is  placed  in  the 
main  loop,  the  routine  is  run  continuously  at  every 
iteration. 
The  ReceiverHandler()  has  three  possible  states:  (1) 
scan for best frequency (2) search for bit frame header 
(preamble), and (3) B-ASK signal demodulation. Scan 
state is the initial state of the routine. The pseudo code 
for ReceiverHandler() is presented in Algorithm 2. 
Signal Sampling  
6.1.3. 
The first step in detecting a GSMem transmission is to 
sample the amplitude of the carrier wave 𝑓.  Note that 
this step takes place  only after 𝑓 has  been  determined 
module  to  sample  the  power  level  (amplitude)  of 𝑓  
in  a  initial  scanning  phase.    Each  time  the  main  loop 
runs  ReceiverHandler(),  Algorithm  2  causes  the  DSP 
(line  1)  and  stores  it  in  a  buffer  (line  2). This data is 
used  later  in  the  demodulation  routines.  The  function 
Measure()  invokes  an  amplitude  measurement request 
on  the  DSP  using  a  function  called l1a_l23_rx().  The 
DSP measurements are performed in bands of 0.2MHz. 
Our  tests  show  that  the  tested  Calypso  baseband  was 
able to sample power measurements at a rate of 1.8kHz, 
hence 1.8kbps is the fastest bit rate that this device can 
demodulate  at.  This  is a  much  faster  bit  rate  than  we 
achieved  due  to  the  limited  processing  capabilities  of 
the device. However,  the power measurements rate is 
an  important  consideration  to  take  into  account  when 
implementing an improved GSMem receiver on a more 
advanced device in the future. 
6.1.4. 
After  the  power  measurement,  a  noise  mitigation 
function is applied to the current sample by averaging it 
essentially  a  moving  average  filter,  an  effective 
technique  for  mitigating  high  frequency  noise.  In  our

frequency is found by scanning the range of the entire 
GSM-850  range  and  selecting  the  frequency  with  the 
minimum average amplitude (in dBm). The assumption 
is that the minimum average amplitude indicates a low 
level  of  interferences,  making it  easier to  detect  a  ‘1’ 
using our variant of B-ASK. In our implementation, the 
scanning  takes  place  after  the  device  boots,  and  after 
every 30 seconds of noisy or lost signals. After the 𝑓 
value  is  set,  the  algorithm  moves  to  the  PREAMBLE 
state. 
6.1.6.  Preamble Detection and Demodulation 
If state is set to PREAMBLE, the receiver searches for a 
preamble sequence (lines 7-11 of Algorithm 2). If the 
sequence ‘1010’ is detected, then it is assumed to be the 
start  of  a  frame, and  state  is  changed  to  RECEIVE  to 
complete  the  B-ASK  demodulation  process  (lines  12-
18).  The  preamble  sequence  allows  the  GSMem

example, a frame may be received at close proximity to

and (3) determine the signals’  duration  𝑡, if unknown.  
Dynamically setting 𝛿 for every frame is necessary for 
the  transmitter  where 𝑓  is  much  stronger  thereby 
away −  where  smaller  amplitude  would  be  more 
setting  amplitude  levels  to  be  high.  The  subsequent 
frame  may  be  sent  while  the  mobile  phone  is  farther 
appropriate.  Once  a  preamble  has  been  detected,  the 
payload  is demodulated in a similar manner using the 
updated parameters. 
6.1.7. 
Signal Loss 
On  line  15  in  Algorithm  2,  the  state  of  the  receiver 
returns  to  PREAMBLE  if  the  whole  payload  has 
received,  or  if  the  signal  has  been  lost.  The  function 
SignalLost()  returns  true  if  during  the  data  reception,

7.  Evaluation 
In this section we evaluate GSMem’s performance as a 
communication  channel.  We  present  in  detail  the 
evaluation using a tampered cellular baseband receiver. 
We also examine the signal reception using a dedicated 
hardware  receiver  programmed  via  software  defined 
radio (SDR). 
7.1.  Experiment Setup 
We  used  the  Motorola  C123  with  the  modified 
firmware  as  the  receiver  for  all  experiments  in  this 
section. As for the transmitters, we used three different 
models  of  desktop  workstations  (WS),  each  with  a 
different configuration and different case. The details of 
these computers and their tested settings can be found 
in  Table  5.  Note  that  WS3  is  a  much  stronger 
transmitter  than  the  others  since  its  RAM  has  a  quad 
channel  operation  mode,  which  employs  wider  data 
paths.  In  all  the  experiments,  the  transmitter  used  the 
4kb allocation method described in Section 5, with a 𝑇 
frequency (𝑓𝑐) ARFCN 25 downlink (940MHz), unless 
of  1.8  seconds.  The  receiver  listened  to  the  carrier

ratio 
There are several major factors that affect the quality of 
a  wireless  communication  channel.  Typically,  the 
quality of a channel is measured by taking the signal to 
noise 
(𝑆𝑁𝑅),  where  𝑆𝑁𝑅≡10log (𝑃/
𝑃)=𝑃𝑑𝐵−𝑃𝑑𝐵  and 𝑃  is  the  power 
level  (a larger 𝑆𝑁𝑅  is  better  than  a  smaller  one).  The 
noise  power  𝑃  can  originate  from  naturally 
occurring noise and from other interferences such as the 
emissions  from  nearby  computers  in  the  same  office 
space.  Therefore, in order to match our attack scenario 
from Section 3, the experiments in this section all take 
place  in  a  regular  work  space  with  several  active 
desktop workstations within a 10m radius.  
There are many factors which can decrease the SNR of 
a wireless channel when the location of the receiver is 
changed.  Because  we  are  dealing  with  a  low  power 
transmission,  we  do  not  consider  properties  such  as 
multipath  propagation  (fading).  Instead,  we  focus  on 
how different receiver distances and positions affect the 
channel’s SNR. 
7.2.  Channel Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) 
The first set of experiments tests the SNR  of the WSs 
from different distances. Figure 6, Figure 7 and Figure 
8  show  the  receiver’s  maximum measured  amplitudes 
at different distances from WSs 1, 2, and 3 respectively. 
Here, WSs 1 and 2 have their RAM set to dual mode at 
1600MHz, and WS3 has its RAM set dual / quad mode 
at 1833 / 2133MHz. As illustrated by Figure 9, the SNR 
remains  positive  (more  signal  power  than noise)  even 
up to a distance of 160cm. This gives a good indication 
of  the  proposed  covert  channel’s  effective  distance. 
Given these observations, we assume that a distance of 
160cm  from  a  workstation is  within  the normal range 
where  a  mobile  device  is  expected  to  be  held  while 
working on the workstation. 
Note that WS3 in dual mode has a significant advantage 
in range over WSs 2 and 3. This is due to the fact that 
WS3 uses a higher RAM frequency than all other WSs 
in the workplace scenario. This means that it is subject 
to less interference, thereby improving its SNR. When 
quad channel mode is used, the range increases further, 
demonstrating that a higher number of active memory 
channels increases the signal’s amplitude.

Figure 9: Receiver SNR from WS1 and WS2 (1600MHz, 
Dual) at various distances from the backside of the chassis. 
During the experiments, we observed that the position 
of  the  receiver  with  respect  to  the  transmitter  has  a 
significant  impact  on  the  SNR.  For  instance,  using 
WS2, an SNR  of  0.5  is achieved at a farther distance 
from  the  front  of  the  chassis  as  opposed  to  the  back. 
Furthermore, 
the  best  position  for  WS1  (using 
1600MHz) is from the front, while the best position for 
WS2  is  from  the  back.  These  differences  make  sense 
considering that each case has variations in shape and 
metal  content.  In  all  cases,  we  observed  that  the 
optimum position for the receiver to be is in front of the 
chassis. This may have to do with the fact that the front 
of an ATX case is mainly made of plastic (blocking less 
of the signal). 
Figure 10 and Figure 11 depict the distance at which an 
SNR  of  0.5dB  can  be  achieved  at  different  positions 
around the WSs.
