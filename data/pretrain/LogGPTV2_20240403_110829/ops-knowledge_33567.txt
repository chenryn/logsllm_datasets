Assistant: This log chunk shows two separate attempts to access the system from two different IP addresses. The first attempt from 5.188.10.180 was unsuccessful, as the authentication failed for the user 'guest'. The second attempt from 103.207.39.212 was also unsuccessful, as the authentication failed for the users 'support' and 'admin'.
