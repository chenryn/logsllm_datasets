User: Please list some database optimization methods to improve query and read/write performance.
Assistant: 1. Establish appropriate indexes to speed up data query. 2. Use partition tables to store large amounts of data to improve data access efficiency. 3. Optimize the busy SQL query to reduce the number of connections and waiting time. 4. Avoid using natural joins and subqueries to query data, and use inner joins and left joins as much as possible to improve query efficiency. 5. Use caching techniques, such as caching data in the application's memory, to avoid repeated queries to the database. 6. Avoid operating a large amount of data in a single transaction to avoid locking the database. 7. Configure appropriate cache and memory management parameters to maximize database performance. 8. Upgrade to a new version of the database software for better performance and functionality. 9. Regularly clean up expired data and unnecessary indexes to avoid database performance degradation. 10. For large database systems, consider using distributed database technologies such as distributed transactions and distributed queries to improve performance.
