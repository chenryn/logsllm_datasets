A minor observation about an otherwise great feature! Using the Insiders
build, the following Lua code causes weird folding:
    function someFunc()
        local longString = [[this is a long
    string that spans multiple lines
    and has some weird folding]]
        print longString
    end
You'll notice that a + shows up on the same "function someFunc()" line _and_
on the last line of the longString declaration. The first + folds up to the
declaration line and the second + folds the rest of the function.
