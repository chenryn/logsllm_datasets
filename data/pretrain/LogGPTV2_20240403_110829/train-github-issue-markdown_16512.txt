Perhaps this isn't really a bug but here goes...feel free to move it if
needed.
Maybe It's me being to stupid but I can't for the life of me find out how to
remove a single zone from a layout even though I know how to add new ones?
Lets say you have three zones vertically distributed as 33%/33%/33% and want
to remove one of them to get 66%/33%. I noticed you can make one of the zones
overlap another one and get kind of the same result, but not sure if that has
any side effects.
