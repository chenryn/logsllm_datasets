Abstract—Modern vehicles are required to comply with a
range of environmental regulations limiting the level of emissions
for various greenhouse gases, toxins and particulate matter. To
ensure compliance, regulators test vehicles in controlled settings
and empirically measure their emissions at the tailpipe. However,
the black box nature of this testing and the standardization
of its forms have created an opportunity for evasion. Using
modern electronic engine controllers, manufacturers can pro-
grammatically infer when a car is undergoing an emission test
and alter the behavior of the vehicle to comply with emission
standards, while exceeding them during normal driving in favor
of improved performance. While the use of such a defeat device
by Volkswagen has brought the issue of emissions cheating to the
public’s attention, there have been few details about the precise
nature of the defeat device, how it came to be, and its effect on
vehicle behavior.
In this paper, we present our analysis of two families of
software defeat devices for diesel engines: one used by the
Volkswagen Group to pass emissions tests in the US and Europe,
and a second that we have found in Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. To
carry out this analysis, we developed new static analysis ﬁrmware
forensics techniques necessary to automatically identify known
defeat devices and conﬁrm their function. We tested about 900
ﬁrmware images and were able to detect a potential defeat device
in more than 400 ﬁrmware images spanning eight years. We
describe the precise conditions used by the ﬁrmware to detect a
test cycle and how it affects engine behavior. This work frames
the technical challenges faced by regulators going forward and
highlights the important research agenda in providing focused
software assurance in the presence of adversarial manufacturers.
I. INTRODUCTION
On September 18, 2015, the US Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) issued a notice of violation to the Volkswagen
Group, accusing one of the world’s largest automakers of
circumventing the EPA’s emissions tests [18], setting into
motion the most expensive emissions scandal in history.
At the heart of the scandal is Volkswagen’s use of a defeat
device, deﬁned by the EPA as any device that “reduces the
effectiveness of the emission control system under conditions
which may reasonably be expected to be encountered in
normal vehicle operation and use,” with exceptions for starting
the engine, emergency vehicles, and to prevent accidents [19].
The defeat device in Volkswagen vehicles used environ-
mental parameters, including time and distance traveled, to
detect a standard emissions test cycle: if the engine control unit
determined that the vehicle was not under test, it would disable
certain emission control measures, in some cases leading the
vehicle to emit up to 40 times the allowed nitrogen oxides [15].
Defeat devices like Volkswagen’s are possible because of
how regulatory agencies test vehicles for compliance before
they can be offered for sale. In most jurisdictions, including
the US and Europe, emissions tests are performed on a chassis
dynamometer, a ﬁxture that holds the vehicle in place while
allowing its tires to rotate freely. During the test, a vehicle
is made to follow a precisely deﬁned speed proﬁle (i.e.,
vehicle speed as a function of time) that attempts to imitate
real driving conditions. The conditions of the test, including
the speed proﬁle, are both standardized and public, ensuring
that the testing can be performed in a transparent and fair
way by an independent party. However, knowing the precise
conditions of the test also makes it possible for manufacturers
to intentionally alter the behavior of their vehicles during the
test cycle, a practice colloquially called “cycle beating.”
technological
While Volkswagen’s cheating was breathtaking in scope
(a dozen vehicle models spanning at least six years), it has
also highlighted the difﬁculty of monitoring manufacturers’
emission compliance. Meeting modern emissions standards
is one of the main challenges faced by car manufactur-
ers as emission standards become more stringent. In many
cases,
limitations put compliance in conﬂict
with consumer demands for performance, efﬁciency, or cost—
creating a powerful incentive for car makers to evade the
regulatory burden. At the same time, automobiles have grown
in complexity: the modern automobile is a complex cyber-
physical system made up of many electronic components,
making it as much a software system as a mechanical one.
A premium-class automobile, for example, can contain more
than 70 electronic control units and 100 million lines of
code [4]. As a part of this trend, nearly all aspects of engine
operation are controlled by an Engine Control Unit (ECU),
an embedded system creating a closed control loop between
engine sensors and actuators. This allows manufacturers to
precisely control all aspects of engine operation and thus drive
signiﬁcant improvements in performance, reliability, and fuel
economy. The ECU is also responsible for ensuring that the
vehicle complies with the emissions requirements imposed by
governmental regulatory bodies. Indeed, while some emission

control measures, like the catalytic converter or particulate
ﬁlters, are passive, many others require active control by
the ECU, which must sometimes sacriﬁce performance or
efﬁciency for compliance. These tradeoffs are particularly
challenging for diesel engines, which in their simplest form are
noisier and emit more particulates and nitrogen oxides (NOx)
than gasoline engines [3].
Electronic engine control has also made it easier to cir-
cumvent emissions testing by implementing a defeat device
in software. The black box nature of emissions testing makes
it nearly impossible to discover such a software-based defeat
device during a test, forcing regulators to rely on heavy ﬁnes
to discourage cheating. Unfortunately, as the Volkswagen case
illustrates, it can take many years to discover such a defeat
device. Given the ultimate limitations of testing, we are led
to consider whether we can detect defeat devices using soft-
ware veriﬁcation techniques. Unfortunately, verifying complex
software systems is a difﬁcult problem in its own right, more
so for a cyber-physical system like a modern automobile. In
our case, the setting is also adversarial—rather than trying
to ﬁnd bugs, we are looking for intentional attempts to alter
a system’s behavior under test conditions. This paper aims
to be a ﬁrst step in cyber-physical system veriﬁcation in an
adversarial setting with two case studies of automobile defeat
devices and binary analysis techniques to identify veriﬁcation-
critical code elements across multiple software revisions.
We begin with two case studies of software defeat de-
vices found in light diesel vehicles. The ﬁrst set belongs
to automobiles produced by the Volkswagen Group, which
has publicly admitted to their use. The Volkswagen defeat
device is arguably the most complex in automotive history.
Unfortunately, there are few technical details available to the
public about its operation, its effect on engine behavior, and
how its design evolved over time; our paper closes this gap and
we believe helps highlight the key challenges for regulators
going forward. Unfortunately, Volkswagen is not alone in
evading emissions testing. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) is
currently being investigated in Europe because recent road test
data showed signiﬁcantly higher emissions than in regulatory
compliance tests [17]. In this paper, we identify and describe
a timer-based defeat device used in the Fiat 500X automobile.
We believe we are the ﬁrst to publicly identify this defeat
device.
Both the Volkswagen and Fiat vehicles use the EDC17
diesel ECU manufactured by Bosch. Using a combination
of manual reverse engineering of binary ﬁrmware images
and insights obtained from manufacturer technical documen-
tation traded in the performance tuner community (i. e., car
enthusiasts who modify their software systems to improve
performance), we identify the defeat devices used, how they
inferred when the vehicle was under test, and how that
inference was used to change engine behavior. Notably, we
ﬁnd strong evidence that both defeat devices were created
by Bosch and then enabled by Volkswagen and Fiat for their
respective vehicles.
To conduct a larger study, we used static code analysis
techniques to track the evolution of the defeat device across
hundreds of versions of vehicle ﬁrmware. More precisely,
we developed a static analysis system, called CURVEDIFF,
to automatically discover the Volkswagen defeat device in a
given ﬁrmware image and extract the parameters determining
its operation. Overall, we analyzed 926 ﬁrmware images and
successfully identiﬁed 406 potential defeat devices inside these
images. Further, we automatically veriﬁed the effects on one
particular subsystem.
In summary, our contributions are as follows:
O We provide a detailed technical analysis of defeat devices
present in vehicles marketed by two independent automo-
bile manufactures, Volkswagen Group and Fiat Chrysler
Automobiles, whose effect is to circumvent emission tests
in the US and Europe.
O We design and implement a static binary analysis tool
called CURVEDIFF for identifying such defeat devices in
a given ﬁrmware image, which enables us to track the
evolution and behavior of circumvention code across a
large number of ﬁrmware images.
O We use our tool to study the evolution of the defeat devices
and its effect on engine behavior across eight years and
over a dozen vehicle models.
However, more than these detailed technical contributions,
we believe the broader impact of our work is to articulate the
challenge of certifying regulatory compliance in the cyber-
physical environment. Today’s black box testing is costly and
time consuming and, as these cases show, can be easily cir-
cumvented by defeat device software that “tests for the tester.”
The gap between black box testing and modern software
assurance approaches drives a critical research agenda going
forward that will only become more important as regulators are
asked to oversee and evaluate increasingly complex vehicular
systems (e. g., autonomous driving). We believe that concrete
examples, such as those we describe in this paper, are key to
ground this discussion and make clear the realistic difﬁculties
faced by regulators.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Sec-
tion II provides the necessary technical background for the rest
of the paper, followed by a discussion of the available data sets
in Section III, and a detailed description of the defeat devices
we found in Section IV. We explain how we implement this
detection at scale in Section V followed by a summary of
the results we ﬁnd using this tool. Finally, we discuss the
implications of our ﬁnding in Section VII and then conclude
with Section VIII.
II. TECHNICAL BACKGROUND
In the following, we provide a brief overview of the
technical concepts needed to understand the rest of this paper.
A. Diesel Engines
The distinguishing difference between a gasoline and diesel
engine is the manner in which combustion is initiated. In
a gasoline engine, a mixture of air and fuel is drawn into
232

the combustion cylinder and ignited by a spark. In a diesel
engine, air is drawn into the combustion cylinder and, at a
critical point in the compression cycle, fuel is injected into the
cylinder, igniting in the compressed air. Thus, in a gasoline
engine, fuel and air are mixed before being drawn into the
cylinder and ignited, whereas in a diesel engine, fuel and air
are mixed at the time of ignition, resulting in an imperfect and
inhomogeneous mixture. This is responsible for many of the
diesel engine’s distinctive characteristics, including the black
smoke and heavy knocking sound known as “diesel knock.”
The black smoke, made up of particulate matter, also called
soot, results from the incomplete combustion of the fuel and
is subject to strict limits in light-duty diesel vehicles. The
second major pollutant in diesel exhaust are nitrogen oxides
(NO and NO2, abbreviated NOx). Current emission standards
impose tight limits on the amount of particulate matter and
NOx emitted and require special steps to limit their levels. The
vehicles that are the subject of this work rely on the following
emission control devices to achieve regulatory conformance.
EGR. Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) is an emission control
scheme where exhaust gas is recirculated back into the engine
intake. EGR signiﬁcantly reduces the amount of NOx in the
exhaust [12], [16]. Unfortunately, EGR also increases the
amount of particulate matter in the exhaust, leading to a trade-
off between NOx and particulate matter.
NSC. A NOx Storage Catalyst (NSC), also called a Lean
NOx Trap (LNT), works by oxidizing NO to NO2 and then
storing NO2 in the catalyst itself. The storage capacity of
the catalyst is limited, lasting from 30 to 300 seconds, after
which it must be regenerated. To regenerate the catalyst, the
engine switches to a rich fuel-air mixture for 2 to 10 seconds.
During regeneration, the engine is less efﬁcient, decreasing
fuel economy [16]. A rich fuel-air mixture also increases
particulate matter production, again trading off NOx emissions
for particulate emissions.
SCR. Selective Catalyst Reduction (SCR) is an alternative
to NSC for reducing NOx emissions that works by injecting
urea into the exhaust stream. SCR is more effective than NSC
(described above) and is usually used in 3-liter diesel engines
and larger. The drawback of SCR is its increased complexity
and the need to carry and replenish the urea ﬂuid (als known
by its trademark name AdBlue). Several Volkswagen vehicles
implicated in the emission cheating scandal are reported to
limit urea injection levels outside of a test cycle. Except for
results reported in Table II, this paper does not cover defeat
devices that manipulate SCR.
DPF. A Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) traps particulates
(soot), greatly reducing the amount of black smoke leaving
the tailpipe. While the DPF is highly effective at trapping
particulates, as the amount of particulates accumulates, the
resistance to air ﬂow increases also, increasing the load on
the engine. To purge the DPF of accumulated deposits, it
must undergo a regeneration cycle approximately every 500
km, lasting 10 to 15 minutes. DPF regeneration requires high
exhaust temperatures that are usually only achieved at full
load. If the vehicle is operated at full load, the DPF will

over time. Image taken from EPA [20].
regenerate on its own. Unfortunately, these conditions may not
arise in normal urban driving, requiring the ECU to perform
active regeneration. In this mode, the ECU adjusts engine
operation to increase exhaust temperature to regenerate the
DPF; however, if the vehicle is only driven for short distances,
such a temperature may never be reached. At sufﬁciently high
soot load, the vehicle will illuminate a special warning lamp,
prompting the driver to drive the vehicle at increased speed
to allow active regeneration to take place. If this does not
happen, the DPF will require service [21]. Thus, while the
DPF is highly effective at reducing particulate emissions, it
imposes a performance penalty and can become a hassle for
the owner who drives the vehicle for short distances. Moreover,
according to the New York Attorney General’s complaint [15],
at normal load Volkswagen’s DPF could only last 50,000
miles before needing replacement, far short of the 120,000
mile standard Volkswagen was required to meet, compelling
Volkswagen to reduce wear on the DPF.
B. Emission Test Cycles and Emission Standards
An emission test cycle deﬁnes a protocol
that enables
repeatable and comparable measurements of exhaust emissions
to evaluate emission compliance. The protocol speciﬁes all
conditions under which the engine is tested, including lab
temperature and vehicle conditions. Most importantly, the test
cycle deﬁnes the speed and load over time that is used to
simulate a typical driving scenario. An example of a driving
cycle is shown in Figure 1. This graph represents the FTP-75
(Federal Test Procedure) cycle that has been created by the
EPA and is used for emission certiﬁcation and fuel economy
testing of light-duty vehicles in the US [7]. The cycle simulates
an urban route with frequent stops, combined with both a cold
and a hot start transient phase. The cycle lasts 1,877 seconds
(about 31 min) and covers a distance of 11.04 miles (17.77
km) at an average speed of 21.2 mph (34.12 km/h).
Table IV in the Appendix lists the main test cycles used
for exhaust emission tests of light-duty vehicles in different

regions of the world. Besides urban test cycles such as FTP-
75, there are also cycles that simulate driving patterns under
different conditions.
To assess conformance, several of these tests are carried out
on a chassis dynamometer, a ﬁxture that holds a car in place
while allowing its drive wheel to turn with varying resistance.
Emissions are measured during the test and compared to an
emission standard that deﬁnes the maximum pollutant levels
that can be released during such a test. In the US, emissions
standards are managed on a national level by the EPA. In
addition, California has its own emissions standards deﬁned
and enforced by the California Air Resources Board (CARB).
California standards are also used by a number of other states,
together with California covering a signiﬁcant fraction of the
US market, making them a de facto second national standard.
In Europe, the emission standards are called Euro 1 through
Euro 6, where Euro 6 is the most recent standard in effect
since September 2014.
C. Electronic Engine Control
In a typical modern car, there are 70-100 electronic control
units [4], [8] that are responsible for tasks such as the human-
machine interface as part of the infotainment system, a speed
control unit, a telematic control unit, or brake control modules.
Among these is the Engine Control Unit (ECU), which is
responsible for the operation of the engine. The subject of
this work is the Bosch EDC17 ECU used in many diesel
light passenger vehicles, and in all of the vehicles implicated
in the Volkswagen diesel emissions scandal. At its core, the
ECU implements a closed control loop by periodically reading
sensor values, evaluating a control function, and controlling
actuators based on the control signal.
Sensors. To control engine behavior, the ECU relies on a
multitude of sensors readings, including crankshaft position;
air pressure and temperature at several points in the intake;
intake air mass; fuel, oil, and coolant temperature; vehicle
speed; exhaust oxygen content (lambda probe); as well as
driver inputs such as the accelerator pedal position, brake pedal
position, cruise control setting, and selected gear.
Control functions. Based on the sensor inputs,
the ECU
implements different functions to control and inﬂuence the
combustion process by interpreting the input data. In a diesel
engine, one of the most important control values is the fuel
injection timing that deﬁnes when and for how long the fuel
injectors remain open in the engine cycle. As noted earlier,
injection timing affects engine power, fuel consumption, and
the composition of the exhaust gas. The ECU also determines
how much of the exhaust gas should be recirculated and how
much urea should be injected into the exhaust to catalyze
nitrogen oxides.
Actuators. The ECU uses the computer control signals to
directly control several actuators, most notably the fuel injector
valves and air system valves, including the EGR valve.
Communication. The ECU also communicates with other sys-
tems inside the car, for example to display the current engine
speed RPM signal or light up diagnosis lamps. Furthermore,
status information about the ECU is sent via an interface such
as the On-Board-Diagnostics (OBD-II) system and the ECU
can also communicate with other control units via the CAN
bus.
D. Business Relationships
The EDC17 ECU is manufactured by Bosch and bought by
automakers, including Volkswagen and Fiat, to control their
diesel engines. The exact details of the business relationship
between Bosch and its customers is not public; however, media
reports, court ﬁlings [15], and the documentation we have
obtained indicates the following basic structure: Bosch builds
the ECU hardware and develops the software running on the
ECU. Manufacturers then specialize an ECU for each vehicle
model by calibrating characteristic ﬁrmware constants whose
