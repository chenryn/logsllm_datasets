User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Webmaster Tools: Network Unreachable - IPv6 Problem? since I have installed W3 Total Cache I constantly get "Network unreachable" errors for ONLY about 3-4 random pages on a domain per day. This is unacceptable and I need to solve it even if it's only 3-4 pages. 

The only error I see in /var/log/messages is

 printk: 2 messages suppressed.


And then when I restarted "named" (I rarely do) I get the message 

**network unreachable resolving '137.7.24.188.in-addr.arpa/PTR/IN':** 2001:610:240:0:53::193#53: 1 Time(s)


Do you think the problem is related to the installation of W3 Total Cache or could it be because I started named without adding ""OPTIONS="-4"" and therefore allowing IPv6 

I heard Google is already using IPv6 

I am very grateful for any response, because I no longer have any idea what I could do.

Assistant: Does your server have working IPv6 connectivity to the internet?

Looks like it's trying to resolve that address via an IPv6 name server, and it's unable to do so.
