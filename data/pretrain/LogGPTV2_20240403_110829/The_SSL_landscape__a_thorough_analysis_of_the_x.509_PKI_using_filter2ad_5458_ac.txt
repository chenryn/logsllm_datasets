### Impact of Client Location on Certificates

The location of the client can result in different certificates, providing insights into the state and practice of certificate deployment in Content Delivery Networks (CDNs). Additionally, this analysis may help determine whether certain locations actively interfere with TLS/SSL traffic by swapping end-host certificates during connection establishment, a potential Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack.

### Data Collection Methods

#### Active Scanning
Active scanning involves systematically querying hosts to collect their certificates. This method provides a snapshot of the deployed PKI infrastructure but does not reflect actual usage patterns.

#### Passive Monitoring
Passive monitoring involves observing live TLS/SSL traffic. The key difference from active scanning is that these certificates reflect the part of the PKI infrastructure that is both deployed and actually used by users. In September 2010, we observed over 108 million TLS/SSL associations, resulting in more than 180,000 certificates, of which about 160,000 were distinct. In a subsequent run over a similar two-week period, we observed more than 140 million TLS/SSL connections, leading to approximately 990,000 certificates, of which about 100,000 were distinct.

#### Grid-Related Traffic
Our research network, which hosts several high-performance computing clusters, saw significant Grid-related traffic secured by TLS/SSL. Although most TLS/SSL connections are due to HTTPS, IMAPs, and POPs, a large number of Grid certificates were encountered. These certificates, often replaced with a median validity period of just 11 hours, are not comparable to those used on the web. Therefore, we filtered them out in our analysis of certificate properties, as detailed in Section 4.4.

#### Related Work Data Set
We also included a data set from related work, obtained using a different scanning strategy. This EFF data set, based on scanning the entire assigned IPv4 address space, took several months to complete. While it provides a higher number of observed certificates, it lacks a mapping onto DNS names, making it impossible to verify the subject for a host name. Our own data sets, however, provide this information.

### Data Pre-Processing

The International Grid Trust Federation operates an X.509 PKI separate from the one for HTTPS and other TLS/SSL-related protocols. Their Root Certificates are not included in the Firefox Root Store but are distributed in Grid setups.

In our setup, certificates were stored without a reference to the TLS/SSL connections during which they were observed. Although we cannot filter out Grid traffic in our analysis of TLS/SSL connections to hosts (Section 5.1), we identified some properties of Grid traffic by correlating encountered IP addresses with known scientific centers.

For our analysis of certificate properties (Section 5.2), we filtered out Grid-related certificates. Our filter mechanism checks if the word "Grid" appears in the issuer field. While imperfect, this method is less resource-intensive than verifying if a certificate chains up to one of the Grid Root CAs. Testing showed that 99.95% of the filtered Grid certificates did not chain to a CA in the Firefox Root Store, and none had a valid certification chain. The values for the validity of certification chains of non-Grid certificates were consistent with our active scans.

### Results of Our Investigations

#### Host Analyses
Before examining the certificates, we present some properties of the TLS/SSL hosts contacted through active scanning or passively monitored.

**Hosts Supporting TLS/SSL:**
A central question is how many hosts support TLS/SSL and allow connections on the HTTPS port. We evaluated replies to our OpenSSL scanner (Figure 4). Two-thirds of all queried hosts offer TLS/SSL on port 443, and over 90% of the top 1,000 do so. Surprisingly, some servers offered plain HTTP on the TLS/SSL port, though this was less common among highly ranked servers.

**Handshake Failures:**
Handshake failures during TLS/SSL setup are relatively low. Only about 800,000 hosts from the expanded Alexa list allowed successful TLS/SSL handshakes on the HTTPS port.

**TLS/SSL Connections:**
Our passive monitoring data shows a large number of TLS/SSL-enabled servers, partly due to Grid traffic. The number of connections increased from 108 million to 140 million between the monitoring intervals in September 2010 and April 2011. Both the number of TLS/SSL servers and clients increased, with most traffic using well-known ports (Table 2).

**Negotiated Ciphers and Key Lengths:**
The strength of cryptographic algorithms and key lengths determines the protection of TLS/SSL connections. Strong ciphers (AES, Camellia, RC4) were selected with appropriate key lengths, sometimes offering a very good safety margin (256 bits). 3DES is still used, but not in the majority of cases. MD5 for Message Authentication Codes, while not problematic at this time, is not encouraged. However, it is still extensively used, though its popularity is decreasing (Figure 5).

#### Certificate Properties
We investigated several security properties of the X.509 PKI, filtering out Grid-related certificates in our passive monitoring data.

**Certificate Occurrences:**
Ideally, each host should have its own certificate. However, it is common for a certificate to be issued for multiple domain names. We checked how often the same certificate is reused on several hosts (Figure 6). The probability that a certificate is reused rises quickly for a smaller number of reuses, with about 1% of cases involving 10 hosts sharing the same certificate.

**Chain Verification Errors:**
We used OpenSSLâ€™s `verify` command to check certification chains. Figure 8 presents the error codes for various data sets. Common errors include expired certificates, self-signed certificates, and broken certification chains. Browsers typically display warnings for these errors, and users may need to take additional steps to determine the exact cause.

By analyzing these properties, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the security and deployment of the TLS/SSL infrastructure.
