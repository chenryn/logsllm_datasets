User: I have to open a system file and read from it. This file is usually only readable by root (the super user). I have a way to ask the user for the superuser password. I would like to use this credentials to open the file and read from it without having my entire program running as a superuser process. Is there a way to achieve this in a multiplatform way?
Assistant: I would split the program in two.

Handles opening the file and accessing the contents.  It can assume it's started with the privileges it needs.
Everything else that doesn't require special privileges.

Put a config entry which describes how to exec or subprocess the command that requires extra privileges.  ie.

access_special_file: sudo access_special_file

or 

access_special_file: runas /user:AccountWithPrivs access_special_file

This offloads some of the system specifics for privilege escalation to the system shell where there may be more convenient ways of gaining the permissions you need.
