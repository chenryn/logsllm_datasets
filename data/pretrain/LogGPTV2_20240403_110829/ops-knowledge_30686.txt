User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Giving Apache2 write access to a user directory I want to give Apache2 write access to a directory in a users home directory so it can write logs etc.

The idea is that I add Apache2 to the users group:

sudo usermod -aG vagrant www-data


And then I simply give the directory to which I want Apache2 to be able to write "group" write and execute permissions:

chmod g+wx ./logs


However, this does not seem to work.

How do I add Apache2 to a users group and set the permissions correctly for write access?

Assistant: You should enable the userdir module and then restart Apache:

$ sudo a2enmod userdir
$ sudo service apache2 restart


If it doesn't solve the problem, check Apache log: /var/log/apache2/error.log
