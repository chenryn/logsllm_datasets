## Feature Request
The ability to modify `*dependencies` blocks in the `pubspec.yaml` from the
CLI.
## Examples
Let's assume this is the user's current `dependencies` section in their
manifest.
    dependencies:
      flutter:
        sdk: flutter
      cupertino_icons: ^0.1.0
Running this command...
    $ flutter packages add url_launcher
Would modify said section to be the following.
    dependencies:
      flutter:
        sdk: flutter
      cupertino_icons: ^0.1.0
      url_launcher: 2.0.1
This would be done by querying `pub.dartlang.org`'s API and getting the latest
version of the given package (which at the time of writing is `2.0.1`).
Perhaps a `--version x.y.z` option could be provided (which would not be
validated against the registry so no network requests would be made) (bikeshed
the syntax).
Bonus points: Support `flutter packages add a b c d` (which would add all
packages if they all exist in the registry).
* * *
As the inverse of `flutter packages add` a `flutter packages remove` command
could be implemented.
This would remove the node with the given name (or error if no such node
exists).

## Question
Is this something that the flutter team is interested in?
If so, would someone be open to mentoring the implementation if necessary?

`cargo-edit` is the inspiration for this feature request.
