My project has one root folder with a bunch of related projects in subfolders
each with their own git rep attached.
In Xamarin Studio it shows each project/subfolder with a description of which
branch each repo is on.. i.e. "master". So instantly I can see each project is
its own repo and which branch they are currently set to.
I deliberately avoided git submodules for other reasons.
Is it possible for VSCode to support different subfolders each with their own
git repo?
