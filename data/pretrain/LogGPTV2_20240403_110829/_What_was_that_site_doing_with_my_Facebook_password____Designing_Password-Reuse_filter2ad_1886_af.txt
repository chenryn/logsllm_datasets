Therefore, we propose the wording of Figure 8 as a model no-
tification for situations related to password reuse. Unfortunately,
few real-world notifications currently follow these best practices.
Table 3 compares the 24 real-world notifications we collected in
Study 1 to the best practices we identified. None of these notifica-
tions met all of the best practices we established. In short, there is
much room for improvement in widely deployed notifications.
9.2 Addressing Persistent Misunderstandings
While the real notifications we tested in Study 1 were successful
in arousing concern, many respondents were unaware of the correct
actions to take in response. The model notification we synthesized
for Study 2, and its variants were successful in spurring the vast
majority of respondents to report that they would change their
password on the site that sent them the notification. This apparent
success was tempered, however, by respondents reporting that their
new password would often be a minor variation on their previous
passwords, or even simply a password reused verbatim from another
account. Furthermore, many respondents reported that they would
leave their passwords unchanged on providers other than the one
that sent them the notification. Collectively, these decisions would
leave users vulnerable to future attacks leveraging password reuse.
The model notification had mixed success at encouraging re-
spondents to take two other actions that could potentially mitigate
password reuse. Users adopting 2FA erects another barrier for at-
tackers in exploiting reused credentials, and nearly two-thirds of
respondents reported being likely to do so after receiving the noti-
fications we tested. Users adopting a password manager and using
it to generate unique, strong passwords for each site is among the
small number of usable solutions to combat password reuse, yet
Figure 8: The notification we found to be the most effective,
relative to our notification goals, for respondents in Study 2.
9 DISCUSSION
We performed the first systematic study of how users understand
and intend to respond to security notifications about situations
related to password reuse. Through two complementary user stud-
ies, we identified best practices for the design of password-reuse
notifications. Further, we identified where notifications are destined
to fall short in helping users fully remediate password reuse issues.
Our formative study lays the groundwork for future field studies.
We recommend future work that does not rely on self-reporting,
instead testing the best practices we developed for password-reuse
notifications in more ecologically valid situations.
9.1 Best Practices
Our Study 1 results led us to identify five key design goals for
password-reuse notifications (Section 5). Some goals (e. g., timeli-
ness) are obvious from general guidelines about warning design,
but the importance of providing an adequate background, as well
as the subtle considerations around engendering trust, are more
specific to the domain of password reuse. Our model notification
in Study 2 performed the best according to these goals, suggesting
these best practices for designing password-reuse notifications:
• The notification should be very explicit about the root causes
of the situation, i. e., password reuse and a data breach.
• Providers should force a password reset on their service.
• The notification should strongly encourage changing similar
passwords on other accounts and thoroughly explain why
doing so staves off attacks.
• The notification should explicitly encourage enabling 2FA
and using password managers.
• Notifications should be sent via both email and more imme-
diate channels (e.g., a blocking notification upon login).
under 40 % of respondents reported being likely to do so. These
intentions did not vary significantly whether or not the notification
explicitly encouraged respondents to take these actions. Future
work could investigate whether describing the exact situation the
given user is in even more explicitly, as well as why these particular
actions are crucial in mitigation, might be more successful.
Our work thus underscores that it is unreasonable to expect
users to maintain dozens of distinct and secure passwords simply
by telling them to do so. Although notifications are a critical source
of information to incite positive change in users’ online security be-
haviors, they are only a band-aid on a gaping wound. In addition to
improving notifications, we recommend devising ecosystem-level
strategies to combat password reuse. Individual account providers
cannot prevent password reuse across services without direct co-
operation with others [64]. As our respondents already expressed
much confusion about how providers “had this information in the
first place, who they got it from and how they got it” (R159), other
actors may be better positioned to make a difference.
Password managers and web browsers have a unique viewpoint
on the full spectrum of a user’s passwords that individual providers
do not. Specifically, they have the opportunity to identify and pre-
vent password reuse when users create, change, or import pass-
words. Unfortunately, current implementations of many password
managers and browsers permit users to reuse passwords across
accounts, often not even warning those users about why this is
problematic. This behavior could be out of fear that users would
not use those password managers or browsers if they felt burdened
by onerous actions. Future work should thus investigate how pass-
word managers and browsers can be more explicit in preventing
password reuse while maintaining a positive user experience. The
current state of password reuse results from many actors’ decisions.
Remediation will require the contributions of many more.
