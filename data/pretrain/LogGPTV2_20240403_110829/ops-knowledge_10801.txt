User: I'm looking to add simple repeating tasks to my current application and I'm looking at the uwsgi signals api and there are two decorators @timer and @rbtimer. I've tried looking through the doc and even the python source at least but it appears it's probably more low level than that somewhere in the c implementation.
I'm familiar with the concept of a red-black tree but I'm not sure how that would relate to timers. If someone could clear things up or point me to the doc I might have missed I'd appreciate it.
Assistant: @timer uses kernel-level facilities, so they are limited in the maximum number of timers you can create.
@rbtimer is completely userspace so you can create an unlimited number of timers at the cost of less precision
