User: How to protect network security from hacking and data leakage?
Assistant: The following are several suggestions for protecting network security: 1. Strengthen the awareness of network security. Addressing cybersecurity needs to start with employees. Organizations should provide regular training and guidance to educate employees on identifying scams, attacks, and other cybersecurity threats, and strengthen knowledge about password security and data protection. 2. Use strong passwords. Using a strong password can greatly enhance account or network security. Strong passwords include uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters, be at least 8 characters long, and don't use personal information that can be easily guessed. 3. Update software and system. Security weaknesses are a common entry point for hackers, and all software, operating systems, and security programs are frequently updated to ensure they are protected with the latest patches. 4. Back up data regularly. Even in the event of a data breach, your organization's important information remains securely stored in backup. 5. Protect data through encryption. Encryption technology can effectively protect data from being leaked or hacked. By encrypting data when stored or transmitted, the risk of data breaches can be minimized. 6. Control network access rights. Try to limit employee access to non-essential websites and applications, and keep access to a minimum to minimize the risk of insider attack. 7. Install antivirus software. Install effective antivirus software and make sure every computer has real-time antivirus software to prevent malware attacks.
