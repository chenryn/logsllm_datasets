whose distributions can be obtained from channel modeling
or experimentation. Thus, the formulation above is a mixed
integer non-linear programming problem and in general
NP-hard. We will present a heuristic method to solve this
problem and show our simulation results in Sec. 6.5.
5.4 Multiple Symbols for Message Integrity Protection
We can combine our channel randomization approach with
existing message integrity protection schemes. For a general
message integrity protection scheme shown in Fig. 1, we
only need to activate our channel randomization approach
during ON slots and synchronization phase, since only
those messages need to be protected against cancellation.
Considering that the ON slot detection probability grows
if there are multiple symbols [16], we can guarantee the
energy detection probability of an ON slot by incorporating
multiple symbols in it. To do so, we ﬁrst upper-bound
the attacker’s knowledge (correlation) under type II and
III attack. For the type II attack, the idea is to extract the
A-B’s CSI by the legitimate receiver B through channel
probing, and mimic the attacker’s strategy to quantify the
intrinsic time-domain correlation in the channel itself, as-
suming perfect estimation of historical CSI by the attacker.
For type III attack, we assume that the attackers can only
be located at a certain distance away from the legitimate
receiver (and transmitter), which can be implemented by
creating a guard zone in practice, otherwise, the attacker can
be easily detected. Since the correlation coefﬁcient decreases
with the increase of the distance from the attacker to the
receiver (this relationship is shown in Table 1, Sec. 5.5), B
can estimate the correlation of the channel that is closest to
itself (which has most related CSI) to mimic the attacker.
Based on the obtained correlation, we calculate the min-
imum energy detection probability for each symbol under
signal cancellation attack using our theoretical framework.
Given a target security requirement (signal cancellation
probability for each ON slot is no larger than some thresh-
old), the number of symbols needed in each ON slot can be
derived. Then the transmitter applies this parameter during
its ON/OFF keying to protect message integrity, while the
receiver uses energy detection to recover the source infor-
mation bits. To enhance efﬁciency, the transmitter sends a
normal message packet followed by Manchester coding and
ON/OFF keying of the Hash of the message.
Given the bound of attacker’s correlation coefﬁcient, we
substitute it along with others parameters (including σh(cid:48)(cid:48),

5.5 Security Analysis
5.5.1 Metrics Affecting Detection Probability
As mentioned before, the correlation coefﬁcient and the
variance of CSI are crucial for detection probability. We ﬁrst
present their deﬁnitions in Eq. (12) and (13).
The variance of CSI h is deﬁned as:
h2

where hi represents a value of CSI sequence h.

Since in our approach, the message integrity protection is
achieved by increasing the randomness of CSI, we quantify
the average randomness of CSI with entropy.
The entropy of CSI h is deﬁned as:
P (hi)log2P (hi)
(14)
i=1
where P (.) is the probability mass function of CSI sequence
h. Note that for simplicity, the entropy calculated in this
way is an upper bound to the real entropy because the
autocorrelation in the CSI sequence has not been considered.
If it is considered, the entropy rate should be used.
5.5.2 Integrity Protection
For the basic message format in Fig. 1 (which is common
to previous works), due to the collision resistance of cryp-
tographic Hash functions, it is infeasible for the attacker to
ﬁnd another m(cid:48) (cid:54)= m such that H(m(cid:48)) = H(m). In addition,
if the attacker modiﬁes any one or more bits in the original
message, approximately half of the hash bits will ﬂip. For

each ﬂipped bit, one ON slot needs to be converted into
an OFF slot. So the probability that the attacker successfully
passes veriﬁcation is approximately (1− Ps)L/2 (negligible).
Thus, message integrity can be guaranteed under our attack
model since we choose n to satisfy a minimum per-ON slot
detection probability Ps, such that any tampering with the
message m will be detected w.h.p.
6 EXPERIMENT
6.1 RA Structure
Fig. 4 (a) presents the 3D view of RA we use in this paper.
The reconﬁgurable parasitic surface consists of 3× 3 square-
shaped metallic pixels that are connected by 12 p-i-n diode
switches [32]. Each switch has ON and OFF status, which
brings 4096 possible modes of operation to RA. To show the
state diversity of RA, antenna gain in the plane of φ = 90◦
for four typical modes is depicted in Fig. 4 (b).
Note that although traditional smart antennas such as
switched beam directional antennas can also change their
radiation patterns [33], their beam shapes remain in the
same direction and their switching is slow. For a typical
smart antenna, its switching time is in the order of 100µs
[34]. In contrast, for the RA used in this paper, the switching
time is about 0.5µs [35], which is an extremely short period.
6.2 Channel Randomness and Correlation
To study the impact of attacker’s positions on channel corre-
lation coefﬁcient when the transmitter is equipped with RA
and OA (omnidirectional antenna) respectively, we conduct
a preliminary experiment under 246 typical antenna modes
that match our reﬂection coefﬁcient constraint. Fig. 5 shows
the placement of all the devices. In the aspects of parame-
ters, the distance from the transmitter to the receiver (A-B)
is always the same, which is 120cm, while the distance from
the attacker to the receiver (C-B) is changing. The results of
preliminary experiments are shown in Table 1.
From the Table. 1, we can see that no matter where the
attacker is, the correlation coefﬁcient between A-B and A-C
is always quite high (which is about 0.98) in OA scenarios,
which indicates the high correlation between those two
channels. Thus, the attacker could cancel out most of the
transmitted message by just simply relaying its received
signal. In contrast, when RA is used, A-B and A-C are much
more independent (correlation coefﬁcients are below 0.5 in

ity density curve of corresponding Rayleigh distribution of

most cases), which shows that the utilization of RA can
increase the randomness between two wireless channels.
To quantify the randomness increment introduced by
antenna modes and multipath, we calculate the entropy in
terms of antenna gain and CSI. The entropy of antenna gain
in the direction of φ = 90◦, θ = 0◦ under 246 typical
antenna modes is 6.9. For the entropy of real-world CSI
data, we ﬁrst limit the values of real and imaginary parts
of CSI for RA and OA scenarios to the same range. The
range is divided into 100 bins and the probability of each
CSI value is the joint probability of its real and imaginary
parts, thus the largest entropy value is log210000 ≈ 13.3.
In fact, the entropy of the legitimate CSI sequence is about
8.9 and 4.8 in RA and OA scenarios respectively. We can
observe that: 1) when RA is used, CSI has greater entropy,
which corresponds to more randomness of wireless channel
in time-domain; 2) the multipath, noise and other dynamic
factors in physical wireless channel lead the entropy of CSI
greater than that of antenna gain (6.9) and antenna mode
(log2246 ≈ 7.9); 3) due to the online nature of signal cancel-
lation attack, to achieve good cancellation performance, the
attacker has to estimate the real and imaginary parts of CSI
with high accuracy in every symbol period, which is hard to
achieve. Thus, even if the CSI distribution has low entropy
(e.g., 9 bits), the attacker’s average estimation error can still
be high.
6.3 Attack Effectiveness Evaluation
6.3.1 System Layout and Parameter Selection
We set up three USRP N210 devices with SBX daughter
boards using LabVIEW on a table in an indoor lab, the ex-
periment’s setup is shown in Fig. 6. We conduct two exper-
iments, since the distance between transmitter and receiver
(TX-RX) is 120cm in experiment 1 (E1), which is slightly
short. To make our study more systematic and practical, we
conduct experiment 2 (E2) and increase the distance of TX-
RX to 360cm. Considering that for the attacker in practice, it
always wants to get close to the legitimate receiver to obtain
more exact CSI and signal data, however, it can be easily
detected if it is too close. Therefore, we put the attacker
25.8cm away from the receiver in both experiments.

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON XXXXXX, VOL. X, NO. X, XXXX 201X
We implement an OFDM transmitter, receiver and at-
tacker on the USRP devices using LabVIEW. The transmitter
sends packets with known symbols in the 2.45GHz band
with bandwidth set to 100M Hz. In order to obtain the true
physical channel state, we connect the three USRPs with
an OctoClock to synchronize their clocks to eliminate the
impact of frequency and phase offset. Especially, the type
II (signal injection) attacker needs to synchronize its clock
with original signal at symbol level. This can be done by ﬁrst
synchronizing at the packet level (e.g., using the techniques
for reactive jamming [36]), and as long as the attacker’s
clock does not differ much from the legitimate device’s, they
will be synchronized for the duration of a short packet.
For type III attacker, since it only relays the signal, the
synchronization at symbol level is easy. In reality, if the
devices are far apart and no cable is available, we can use
accurate external clocks such as GPS clocks to synchronize
TX/RX. The receiver extracts the frequency domain CSI
for each symbol in one OFDM subcarrier from baseband
before equalization, and we analyze the CSI sequence on
the computer using Matlab. The QPSK is used and each
OFDM symbol contains 320 QPSK symbols. Though our
OFDM system has 256 sub-channels, for simplicity, we only
estimate the CSI for one of them. As mentioned in Sec.
5.2, the switching time for RA should set to be one OFDM
symbol duration at most. Therefore, we connect RA with
an Arduino Uno Rev 3 programmable microcontroller [37]
to randomly switch antenna mode within 4096 available
modes. Each mode lasts for 256µs, which equals to OFDM
symbol period. All parameters are shown in Table 2.
6.3.2 Experimental Strategies
We tested two scenarios for both type II and III attackers: the
transmitter is equipped with OA and RA in scenario 1 and
2 respectively; In both scenarios, the receiver and attacker
are equipped with OA. For type II attacker, to generate the
attacker’s estimated CSI sequence g, we assume the attacker
uses a simple autoregression technique to estimate h. That
is, the attacker takes the CSI of h at time tn as the CSI of g
at time tn+1.
For the much more practical type III attacker, we im-
plement two cancellation attack strategies: strategy 1: the
attacker only relays the received signal; strategy 2: the
attacker processes the received signal with optimal attack
strategy proposed in Sec. 4.2.2 and then relays it. It is
worth noting that when the transmitter is equipped with
RA, the CSI is randomly changing according to antenna
mode. Thus, in the second scenario, the LoS and NLoS
components of CSI are both unknown to the attacker. Con-
sidering the little knowledge of the LoS component to the
attacker, the optimal strategy for the attacker in scenario
2 is to regard the whole CSI as its NLoS component, and
directly apply NLoS component strategy proposed in Sec.
4.2.2 to implement cancellation. In contrast, the attacker in
