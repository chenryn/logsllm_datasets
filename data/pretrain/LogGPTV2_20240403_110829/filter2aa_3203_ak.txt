Because ICANN will never assign the IPv4 addresses in the private address space to an organization 
connected to the Internet, Internet routers will never contain routes to private addresses. You cannot 
connect to a private address over the Internet. Therefore, a host that has a private address must send 
its Internet traffic requests to an Application layer gateway (such as a proxy server) that has a valid 
public address or through a network address translation (NAT) device that translates the private 
address into a valid public address. 
Automatic Private IP Addressing 
As described in Chapter 1, "Introduction to TCP/IP," you can configure an interface on a computer 
running Windows so that the interface obtains an IPv4 address configuration automatically. If the 
computer does not contact a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server, the computer uses 
its alternate configuration, as specified on the Alternate Configuration tab of the properties dialog box 
for the Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) or Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) component. 
If the Automatic Private IP Address option is selected on the Alternate Configuration tab and a 
DHCP server cannot be found, TCP/IP in Windows uses Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA). The 
TCP/IP component randomly selects an IPv4 address from the 169.254.0.0/16 address prefix and 
assigns the subnet mask of 255.255.0.0. ICANN has reserved this address prefix, and it is not 
reachable on the Internet. APIPA allows single-subnet Small Office/Home Office (SOHO) networks to 
Chapter 3 – IP Addressing 
TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows  
Page: 65 
use TCP/IP without requiring an administrator to configure and update static addresses or administer a 
DHCP server. APIPA does not configure a default gateway. Therefore, you can exchange traffic only 
with other nodes on the subnet.  
Special IPv4 Addresses 
The following are special IPv4 addresses: 
0.0.0.0 
Known as the unspecified IPv4 address, it indicates the absence of an address. The unspecified 
address is used only as a source address when the IPv4 node is not configured with an IPv4 
address configuration and is attempting to obtain an address through a configuration protocol such 
as DHCP. 
127.0.0.1 
Known as the IPv4 loopback address, it is assigned to an internal loopback interface. This interface 
enables a node to send packets to itself. 
Unicast IPv4 Addressing Guidelines 
When you assign subnet prefixes to the subnets of an organization, use the following guidelines: 
The subnet prefix must be unique within the IPv4 network.  
If hosts can directly access the Internet from the subnet, you must use a public IPv4 address prefix 
assigned by ICANN or an Internet service provider. If hosts cannot directly access the Internet from 
the subnet, use either a legal public address prefix or a private address prefix that is unique within 
your private intranet. 
The subnet prefix cannot begin with the numbers 0 or 127.  
Both of these values for the first octet are reserved, and you cannot use them for IPv4 unicast 
addresses. 
When you assign host IDs to the interfaces of nodes on an IPv4 subnet, use the following guidelines: 
The host ID must be unique within the subnet. 
You cannot use the all-zeros or all-ones host IDs. 
When defining the range of valid IPv4 unicast addresses for a given address prefix, use the following 
standard practice: 
For the first IPv4 unicast address in the range, set all the host bits in the address to 0, except for the 
low-order bit, which you set to 1. 
For the last IPv4 unicast address in the range, set all the host bits in the address to 1, except for the 
low-order bit, which you set to 0. 
For example, to express the range of addresses for the address prefix 192.168.16.0/20: 
The first IPv4 unicast address in the range is 11000000 10101000 00010000 00000001 (host bits are 
underlined), or 192.168.16.1. 
Chapter 3 – IP Addressing 
TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows  
Page: 66 
The last IPv4 unicast address in the range is 11000000 10101000 00011111 11111110 (host bits are 
underlined), or 192.168.31.254. 
Therefore, the range of addresses for the address prefix 192.168.16.0/20 is 192.168.16.1 to 
192.168.31.254.  
IPv4 Multicast Addresses 
IPv4 uses multicast addresses to deliver single packets from one source to many destinations. On an 
IPv4 intranet that is enabled for multicast, routers forward an IPv4 packet addressed to an IPv4 
multicast address to the subnets on which hosts are listening to the traffic sent to the IPv4 multicast 
address. IPv4 multicast efficiently delivers many types of communication from one source to many 
destinations. 
IPv4 multicast addresses are defined by the class D Internet address class: 224.0.0.0/4. IPv4 multicast 
addresses range from 224.0.0.0 through 239.255.255.255. IPv4 multicast addresses for the 
224.0.0.0/24 address prefix (224.0.0.0 through 224.0.0.255) are reserved for multicast traffic on a local 
subnet.  
For more information about IPv4 multicast addresses and processes, see Appendix B, "IP Multicast." 
IPv4 Broadcast Addresses 
IPv4 uses a set of broadcast addresses to deliver packets from one source to all interfaces on the 
subnet. All the interfaces on the subnet process packets sent to IPv4 broadcast addresses. The 
following are the types of IPv4 broadcast addresses: 
Network broadcast 
Formed by setting all the host bits to 1 for a classful address prefix. For example, 131.107.255.255 
is a network broadcast address for the classful address prefix 131.107.0.0/16. Network broadcasts 
send packets to all interfaces of a classful network. IPv4 routers do not forward network broadcast 
packets. 
Subnet broadcast 
Formed by setting all the host bits to 1 for a classless address prefix. For example, 131.107.26.255 
is a network broadcast address for the classless address prefix 131.107.26.0/24. Subnet 
broadcasts are used to send packets to all hosts of a classless network. IPv4 routers do not forward 
subnet broadcast packets. 
For a classful address prefix, there is no subnet broadcast address, only a network broadcast 
address. For a classless address prefix, there is no network broadcast address, only a subnet 
broadcast address. 
All-subnets-directed broadcast 
Formed by setting the classful address prefix host bits to 1 for a classless address prefix. The all-
subnets-directed broadcast address is deprecated in RFC 1812. A packet addressed to the all-
subnets-directed broadcast address was defined to reach all hosts on all of the subnets of a 
classful address prefix that has been subnetted. For example, 131.107.255.255 is the all-subnets-
directed broadcast address for the subnetted address prefix 131.107.26.0/24. The all-subnets-
directed broadcast address is the network broadcast address of the original classful address prefix.

Limited broadcast 
Formed by setting all 32 bits of the IPv4 address to 1 (255.255.255.255). The limited broadcast 
address is used for one-to-everyone delivery on the local subnet when the local subnet prefix is 
unknown. IPv4 nodes typically use the limited broadcast address only during an automated 
configuration process such as Boot Protocol (BOOTP) or DHCP. For example, a DHCP client must 
use the limited broadcast address for all traffic sent before the DHCP server acknowledges the use 
of the offered IPv4 address configuration.

IPv6 Addressing 
The most obvious difference between IPv6 and IPv4 is address size. An IPv6 address is 128 bits long, 
which is four times larger than an IPv4 address. A 32-bit address space allows for 232 or 4,294,967,296 
possible addresses. A 128-bit address space allows for 2128 or 
340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456 (or 3.41038 or 340 undecillion) possible 
addresses. 
The IPv4 address space was designed in the late 1970s when few people, if any, imagined that the 
addresses could be exhausted. However, due to the original allocation of Internet address class-based 
address prefixes and the recent explosion of hosts on the Internet, the IPv4 address space was 
consumed to the point that by 1992 it was clear a replacement would be necessary. 
With IPv6, it is even harder to conceive that the IPv6 address space will be consumed. To help put this 
in perspective, a 128-bit address space provides 655,570,793,348,866,943,898,599 (6.51023) 
addresses for every square meter of the Earth’s surface. The decision to make the IPv6 address 128 
bits long was not so that every square meter of the Earth could have 6.51023 addresses. Rather, the 
relatively large size of the IPv6 address space is designed for efficient address allocation and routing 
that reflects the topology of the modern-day Internet and to accommodate 64-bit media access control 
(MAC) addresses that newer networking technologies are using. The use of 128 bits allows for multiple 
levels of hierarchy and flexibility in designing hierarchical addressing and routing, which the IPv4-based 
Internet lacks. 
RFC 4291 describes the IPv6 addressing architecture. 
IPv6 Address Syntax 
IPv4 addresses are represented in dotted decimal notation. For IPv6, the 128-bit address is divided 
along 16-bit boundaries, each 16-bit block is converted to a 4-digit hexadecimal number (the Base16 
numbering system), and adjacent 16-bit blocks are separated by colons. The resulting representation is 
known as colon-hexadecimal. 
The following is an IPv6 address in binary form: 
0011111111111110001010010000000011010000000001010000000000000000 
0000001010101010000000001111111111111110001010001001110001011010 
The 128-bit address is divided along 16-bit boundaries: 
0011111111111110   0010100100000000   1101000000000101   0000000000000000  
0000001010101010   0000000011111111   1111111000101000   1001110001011010     
Each 16-bit block is converted to hexadecimal, and adjacent blocks are separated with colons. The 
result is: 
3FFE:2900:D005:0000:02AA:00FF:FE28:9C5A 
IPv6 representation can be further simplified by removing the leading zeros within each 16-bit block. 
However, each block must have at least a single digit. With leading zero suppression, the address 
becomes: 
3FFE:2900:D005:0:2AA:FF:FE28:9C5A

Converting Between Binary and Hexadecimal 
The hexadecimal numbering system uses the digits 0 through 9, A, B, C, D, E, and F and the 
exponential powers of 16 to express a number. Table 3-4 lists decimal, hexadecimal, and binary 
equivalents of the numbers 0-15.

Table 3-4  Decimal, Hexadecimal, and Binary Conversions 
To convert a hexadecimal number to a binary number, convert each hexadecimal digit to its 4-bit 
equivalent. For example, to convert the hexadecimal number 0x03D8 to binary, convert each 
hexadecimal digit (0, 3, D, and 8) to binary. Therefore, 0x03D8 is 0000 0011 1101 1000, or 
0000001111011000. 
To convert a binary number to a hexadecimal number, segment the binary number into 4-bit blocks 
starting from the low-order bit. Then convert each 4-bit block to its hexadecimal equivalent. For 
example, to convert the binary number 0110000110101110 to hexadecimal, first divide the entire 
number into 4-bit blocks, which are 0110 0001 1010 1110. Then, convert each block to hexadecimal 
digits, which are 0x61AE. 
Although you can use the calculator in Windows Server 2003 or Windows XP to convert between 
hexadecimal and binary, it helps you to better understand the conversions if you can do them manually. 
To convert between decimal and hexadecimal, which you will not need often for IPv6 addresses, use 
the Windows calculator.

Compressing Zeros 
Some types of addresses contain long sequences of zeros. To further simplify the representation of 
IPv6 addresses, you can compress a single contiguous sequence of 16-bit blocks set to 0 in the colon 
hexadecimal format to “::”, known as double-colon.  
For example, you can compress the unicast IPv6 address of FE80:0:0:0:2AA:FF:FE9A:4CA2 to 
FE80::2AA:FF:FE9A:4CA2, and you can compress the multicast IPv6 address FF02:0:0:0:0:0:0:2 to 
FF02::2. 
You can use zero compression to compress only a single contiguous series of 16-bit blocks expressed 
in colon hexadecimal notation. You cannot use zero compression to include part of a 16-bit block. For 
example, you cannot express FF02:30:0:0:0:0:0:5 as FF02:3::5. 
To determine how many 0 bits are represented by the “::”, you can count the number of blocks in the 
compressed address, subtract this number from 8, and then multiply the result by 16. For example, the 
address FF02::2 has two blocks (the “FF02” block and the “2” block), so the other six blocks of 16 bits 
(96 bits total) have been compressed. 
You can use zero compression only once in a given address. Otherwise, you could not determine the 
number of 0 bits represented by each instance of “::”. If an address contains two series of zero blocks of 
the same length and no series of zero blocks is longer, then by convention the left-most block is 
expressed as “::”. 
IPv6 Address Prefixes 
You express IPv6 address ranges as address prefixes in the same manner as you express IPv4 
address ranges using prefix length notation. For example, FF00::/8 is an address range, 2001:DB8::/32 
is a route prefix, and 2001:DB8:0:2F3B::/64 is a subnet prefix. You do not express an address prefix 
using a colon hexadecimal equivalent of an IPv4 subnet mask. 
Types of IPv6 Addresses 
IPv6 has three types of addresses: 
Unicast 
A unicast address identifies a single interface within the scope of the type of unicast address. With 
the appropriate unicast routing topology, packets addressed to a unicast address are delivered to a 
single interface. A unicast address is used for communication from one source to a single 
destination. 
Multicast 
A multicast address identifies multiple interfaces. With the appropriate multicast routing topology, 
packets addressed to a multicast address are delivered to all interfaces that are identified by the 
address. A multicast address is used for communication from one source to many destinations, with 
delivery to multiple interfaces. 
Anycast 
An anycast address identifies multiple interfaces. With the appropriate routing topology, packets 
addressed to an anycast address are delivered to a single interface, the nearest interface that the 
address identifies. The “nearest” interface is defined as being closest in terms of routing distance.  
Chapter 3 – IP Addressing 
TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows  
Page: 71 
An anycast address is used for communication from one source to one of multiple destinations, with 
delivery to a single interface. 
IPv6 addresses always identify interfaces, not nodes. A node is identified by any unicast address 
assigned to one of its interfaces.  
RFC 4291 does not define any types of broadcast addresses. Instead, IPv6 multicast addresses are 
used. For example, the subnet and limited broadcast addresses from IPv4 are replaced with the 
reserved IPv6 multicast address of FF02::1. 
IPv6 Unicast Addresses 
The following types of addresses are unicast IPv6 addresses:
