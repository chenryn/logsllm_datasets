In latest version v1.0.0-beta.33 I can see several problems in IE 11.  
Problems can even be seen on demo pages
  * [x ] I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
Behaviour should be o.k. in all browsers
## Current Behavior
  1. Layout Problems. Please see below
  2. As a side note: I am experiencing much slower performance in IE11 than in other browsers. Unfortunately I don't know since which version this is the case. As I don't have a codesandbox (don't have the time) to reproduce, you can also ignore this side note.
