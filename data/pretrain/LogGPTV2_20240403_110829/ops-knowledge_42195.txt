PyDev includes a feature that allows you to terminate all running processes. I'm wondering if PyCharm offers a similar functionality. So far, I have only found a "stop" button in the menu.

To address your query, here are a couple of options in PyCharm:

1. **Close a Single Tab**: You can use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl-Shift-F4` to close the currently active tab.
2. **Close All Running Processes**: To stop all running processes, you can right-click on the run configuration bar (next to the "Run" button) and select "Close All."

These steps should help you manage your running processes more effectively in PyCharm.
