### Typical System Configuration of a Two-Site Simulcast or Multicast System

When the service area requires multiple transmitter sites and simultaneous coverage, broadcast-type systems such as simulcast and multicast are employed (Exhibit 3).

#### 2.3.4 Simulcast Systems

Simulcast systems utilize several geographically separated base stations or repeaters that transmit on the same frequencies simultaneously (Exhibit 4). This deployment allows a single radio channel to cover a wider region than a single-site transmitter. These networks require a timing system to synchronize each transmitter, ensuring that transmissions on the same frequency are in phase, thereby reducing heterodyne interference. In a simulcast system, when activated, a quasi-synchronous transmission occurs, meaning the same message is transmitted at the same time on the same radio channel by two or more transmitters that are phase-locked to the same frequency.

**Use Cases:**
- **Large Service Area:** When a large service area must be covered by transmitters of moderate power, resulting in a small overlap in coverage.
- **Intensive Coverage:** When high signal-to-noise ratio coverage is needed throughout the area, leading to substantial overlap in coverage to provide diversity against shadowing (fading).
- **Spectrum Limitations:** When available spectrum is insufficient to implement a multicast or zone-type system.

**Frequency Layout:**
- Channels F1 - Fn have coverage over the entire service area.

**Exhibit 4: Frequency Layout of a Seven-Site Simulcast LMR System**

#### 2.3.5 Multicast Systems

In multicast systems, channels F1 - Fn are divided into 7 groups (G1-G7). Each site is assigned a different frequency group from adjacent sites to minimize co-channel interference (Exhibit 5). Unlike simulcast systems, which transmit on the same RF channels simultaneously from each base station/repeater, multicast systems use different RF channels at each site. Frequencies are reused in different cells, but the arrangement ensures the same frequency is never used in adjacent cells. This configuration offers the same coverage advantages as a simulcast system, eliminates co-channel interference, and allows for smaller cell configurations, enhancing RF penetration within the cell. However, multicast systems require multiple frequencies and users need to change mobile channels as they move between cells.

**Exhibit 5: Frequency Layout of a Ten-Site Multicast or Zone-Type LMR System with a Frequency Reuse Ratio of 7**

**Advantages and Disadvantages:**
- **Advantages:** Expanded coverage, elimination of co-channel interference, and better RF penetration.
- **Disadvantages:** Requires multiple frequencies and user channel changes.

#### 2.3.6 Zone-Type Systems

Zone-type systems address the issue of lower user density by dividing the coverage area into zones served by different sites. The same channel can be used simultaneously by different groups of users at different sites, enabling the system to handle higher user density compared to broadcast-type systems. The frequency layout is similar to that of multicast LMR and cellular telephone systems. Frequencies are reused in different cells, but the arrangement ensures the same frequency is never used in adjacent cells (Exhibit 5). The frequency reuse ratio is typically 4 or 7.

**Advantages and Disadvantages:**
- **Advantages:** Provides frequency reuse across the coverage area.
- **Disadvantages:** Requires a high number of frequencies. For example, a 10-channel system with a frequency reuse ratio of 4 requires 40 frequency pairs, or 70 pairs with a reuse ratio of 7. Zone architecture is primarily used in trunked systems, requiring a central control computer.

### 2.4 Trunked Systems

The land mobile frequency spectrum is currently very crowded, making it difficult to obtain additional frequencies. Trunking is a conservation technique that allows a relatively small number of communication channels to be shared among a large number of users. A trunk is a shared voice or data traffic path between two points. Trunked systems use access control schemes to share channel capacity, resulting in more balanced load sharing. This contrasts with non-trunked or conventional systems, where users manually coordinate access to system resources, potentially leading to unbalanced channel loads.

**Trunking Architectures:**
- **Dedicated Control Channel (Centralized Trunking):** The system controller communicates with units via a control channel. All other channels act as repeaters for communications between user radios. User radios monitor the control channel and send channel requests when needed. The system controller checks for available channels and sends instructions to the units.
- **Subaudible Signaling Control (Decentralized Trunking):** No separate control channel is required, and all channels can be used for communications. User radios monitor subaudible control data continuously and switch channels based on the received information. This design is usually limited to 15 channels.

**Exhibit 6: Typical Configuration of a Centralized Trunked System**

**Modes of Trunking:**
- **Message Trunking (Conversation Trunking):** Uses a delay timer (hang time) to allow uninterrupted communication for the entire conversation.
- **Transmission Trunking:** The repeater channel is relinquished immediately after each user releases the key during an ongoing conversation.
- **Quasi-Transmission Trunking:** Holds the channel open for about one second after the last user de-keys the microphone.

**User Group Structure:**
- Users select talk groups rather than individual channels. Each user radio is affiliated with at least one group and has an individual ID. When a member of a talk group initiates a conversation, the trunked system controller automatically allocates a free radio channel to that talk group.

**Exhibit 7: An Example of User Talk Groups in a Trunked System**

### 2.5 Hybrid Systems

Hybrid systems combine conventional and trunked systems, offering both conventional and trunked user groups and features within a single system. The main reasons for hybrid architectures are cost-effectiveness and call setup delay. Conventional sites may be more cost-effective in areas with few users, while trunked portions serve areas with higher user density. Conventional channels provide dedicated access with little or no call setup delay, crucial for public safety agencies, while trunked channels offer increased capacity for larger organizations.

**System Components:**
- Hybrid systems need the same components as trunked systems and can be configured with one or more conventional channels. Conventional channels represent talk group users to the trunked system logic.

**User Operation:**
- Radios can operate in either conventional only, trunked only, or both modes. Users select the mode before establishing a call. In conventional mode, users monitor the channel and wait for it to be free. In trunked mode, users depress the PTT button to make a call request, and the system controller handles the call.
