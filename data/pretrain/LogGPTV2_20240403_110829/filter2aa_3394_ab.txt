Typical System Configuration of a Two-Site Simulcast or Multicast System
If the service area calls for multiple transmitter sites and simultaneous coverage of that
area, broadcast-type systems are used.  The two major kinds of such systems are simulcast and
multicast (Exhibit 3).
2.3.4
Simulcast Systems
Simulcast systems use several geographically separated base stations/repeaters that
transmit on the same frequencies simultaneously (Exhibit 4).  Through this type of a system
deployment, a single radio channel can be radiated over a wider region than with a single-site
transmitter.  These networks require a timing system to synchronize each transmitter on the
network to assure that transmissions on the same frequency are in phase thus reducing
heterodyne interference.  A simulcast system, when activated, performs a quasi-synchronous
transmission, which means that the same message is transmitted at the same time on the same
radio channel by two or more transmitters that are phase-locked to the same frequency.
Such systems are used where:
• A large service area must be covered by transmitters of moderate power, in which case there
will be a small overlap in the coverage of the transmitters

• Intensive (high signal-to-noise ratio) coverage is needed throughout the area, in which case
there will be a substantial overlap in the coverage of the transmitters that are used to provide
diversity against shadowing (fading)
• Available spectrum is insufficient to implement a multicast or zone-type system.

Multicast systems are similar to simulcast systems with exception of the radio channels
transmitted.  While a simulcast system transmits on the same RF channels simultaneously from
each base station/repeater, multicast systems use different RF channels at each site (Exhibit 5).
Frequencies are reused in different cells, but the arrangement ensures the same frequency is never
used in adjacent cells.  This configuration offers the same coverage advantages of a simulcast
system, eliminates the occurrence of co-channel interference from multiple sites, and allows
smaller cell configuration which can allow greater RF penetration within the cell.  However,
multicast systems require multiple frequencies (limited available spectrum) and their users need
to change mobile channels as they move between cells.
The main disadvantage of a broadcast-type architecture is that though it significantly
expands coverage area compared with a single-site system, it does not increase capacity.  For
example, when two users occupy a channel at one site, that channel normally cannot be used at
the same time by other users at different sites.

2.3.6
Zone-Type Systems
The disadvantage of lower user density is solved by applying zone approach and trunking
logic.  The coverage area is divided into zones served by different sites.  The same channel can
be used simultaneously by different groups of users at different sites thus enabling the system to
handle a higher user density compared to broadcast-type systems.  The frequency layout of zone-
type systems is very similar to that of multicast LMR and cellular telephone systems.
Frequencies are reused in different cells, but the arrangement ensures the same frequency is never
used in adjacent cells (Exhibit 5).  Frequency reuse patterns are defined by the ratio of the
distance between identical frequency cells to the cell radius, which is a function of the desired
carrier-to-interference ratio for the system design.  The frequency reuse ratio is usually 4 or 7.  A
frequency layout for a system with a frequency reuse ratio of 7 is shown in Exhibit 5.
The main advantage of zone architecture is that it provides frequency reuse across the
coverage area.  The main disadvantage of the architecture is the high number of frequencies it
needs.  For example, if a frequency reuse ratio of 4 is chosen, a 10-channel system requires 40
frequency pairs, or 70 pairs if a reuse ratio of 7 is used.  Zone architecture is used mainly in
trunked systems, because it requires the use of a central control computer to operate.
2.4
Trunked Systems
At the present time the land mobile frequency spectrum is very crowded and additional
frequencies are difficult to obtain.  For this reason there has been a great deal of work in
developing new techniques to conserve spectrum.
Trunking is one of these conservation systems.  Trunking is the commonly accepted term
for electronically controlled sharing of a relatively small number of communications channels
among a relatively large number of users.  In general terms, a trunk is a shared voice or data
traffic path between two points.  Trunked systems use access control schemes to share channel
capacity among many users.  The electronic control enables users to take advantage of the fact
that some transmitted channels are idle at a particular time while others are busy.  This results in
a more balanced load sharing between trunks.  This is in contrast to a non-trunked or
conventional system, where the users exercise their own coordination regarding access to system
resources, by listening for idle time and making manual channel selections, which may result in
unbalanced channel loads. [2]
Trunked architectures differ by implementation of the system’s control logic.  There are
two main types of trunking architectures: dedicated control channel (centralized trunking by FCC
definition) and subaudible signaling control (decentralized trunking).1  A combination of the two
is also used in some systems.
In a dedicated control channel system (centralized trunked system), the system controller
is the centralized logic of the system.  It communicates with the units by way of the control
The trunking types listed may have a variety of names depending on the vendors; however the concepts remain the same.

channel.  All other channels act as repeaters for communications between user radios.  When user
radios are not communicating, they continuously monitor the control channel.  When a user radio
needs to communicate, it sends out a channel request on the control channel.  This request
includes the ID of the talk group with which the radio wants to communicate.  The system
controller checks whether a vacant channel is available or not, and sends instructions to units on
the control channel.
This type of trunked architecture typically places blocked calls in a queue to wait for a
vacant channel thus minimizing lost calls.  Typically, a first-in-first-out queuing principle is
used.  As soon as a channel becomes available, a queued system signals it to the user radio.  To
assess traffic load performance of a system of this type, the Erlang C model is typically used,
which calculates the average delay in queue.
The typical trunking system consists of some type of access control (whether in each
mobile unit or centralized at a base station site), switching equipment, system management
computer, control and voice channel repeaters, modems, and telephone interconnect as illustrated
in Exhibit 6.  Centralized trunking uses a microprocessor that governs all of the base station
repeaters after receiving and processing service requests over the control channel.  The switching
equipment provides the interface between dispatch consoles and the central controller.  The
system computer allows computer access and monitoring of the central controller. In addition,
trunking systems can be programmed to include specific options depending on the user’s needs.
Talk groups, encryption, emergency (e.g., man-down) operation, and telephone access are
examples of some of the programming options.

Exhibit 6
Typical Configuration of a Centralized Trunked System
A typical operational pattern of control channel trunking is as follows: User A wants to
contact all of the units in his or her talk group.  The Push-to-Talk (PTT) is keyed, which causes
the radio to send a short burst of data to the control channel repeater.  This data identifies the
caller attributes and enters a channel request to the system controller.  User A’s radio then
switches to receive mode to await a data response from the controller.  Upon receipt of the
request, the system controller attempts to select an available voice channel.  If a voice channel is
available, the system controller sends a data message over the control channel switching all units
in User A’s talk group to the available voice channel.  Only units in this particular talk group are

automatically switched to the assigned channel.  When User A starts talking, all the members of
the talk group will hear the conversation.  This preempts any other use of that assigned channel
for the duration of the call.
Trunked systems with subaudible control signaling, also known as scan-based or
decentralized trunked systems, do not require a separate control channel and all channels can be
used for communications between users.  Each user radio monitors subaudible control data
transmissions from its home channel continuously when it is not engaged in communications
with other users.  A home channel is one of the repeater transmit frequencies to which a
particular user radio is assigned.  The control information received subaudibly tells user radios
what channel they should switch to if they need a channel to initiate communications or receive a
call.  It also tells them if all channels are busy.  If a user attempts to initiate communications, he
or she will hear a busy tone.
The logic in this system is distributed among each of the repeaters.  A data bus
connecting all of the sites updates the logic of individual sites to reflect which channels and sites
are active and which are vacant.  In this way, the system can operate without a system controller.
The logic at each repeater can control those user radios for which it has a home channel.  User
radios are constantly advised of data relevant to the initiation and reception of communications.
This design is usually limited to 15 channels.
In trunked systems with subaudible signaling, blocked calls are usually lost rather than
being placed in a queue to await a vacant channel.  The user must attempt to initiate
communications later.  To assess traffic load performance of a system of this type, the Erlang B
traffic model is typically used, which calculates the probability of lost calls.
Modes of Trunking - Either type of trunked system architecture, control channel or
subaudible control, has the capability to perform message or transmission trunking.  Message-
trunking mode, which is also called conversation trunking, uses a delay timer (hang time), which
allows traffic an uninterrupted repeater (communication channel) for the entire conversation
between several users.  In a system operating in transmission-trunking mode, the repeater channel
is relinquished immediately after each user releases the key of the radio during an ongoing
conversation (no hang time).  Subsequent transmissions within the same conversation are
transferred to another repeater when the second party keys his or her radio.  Message-trunking
mode provides greater channel availability for the user, while transmission trunking provides a
greater channel availability for the system.
A third mode of trunking is a technique called quasi-transmission trunking.  This
technique holds a channel open for about one second after the last user de-keys the microphone
(short hang time).  Quasi-transmission trunking mode does not hold the channel as long as
message trunking after the microphone has been de-keyed.  This should result in fewer times
when the repeater is unavailable to other users.  At the same time, the channel is held long
enough for users to keep the channel if they respond quickly (in less than one second) to each
other’s transmissions.

Users do not manually select individual radio channels in a trunked system, unlike the
procedure in a conventional system.  Instead, they select talk groups, by performing essentially
the same physical action of setting a knob to a different number.  Each user radio is affiliated
with at least one group and/or subgroup and has an individual ID.  These groups may be called
fleets and subfleets, or announcement groups and talk groups, depending on the manufacturer of
the particular system.  A talk group can be a subset of an announcement group as illustrated in
Exhibit 7.  When a member of a talk group initiates a conversation, the trunked system controller
automatically allocates one of the free radio channels to that talk group.  Each radio in the talk
group is automatically tuned to the allocated channel for the duration of the transmission without
the user’s involvement.

An Example of User Talk Groups in a Trunked System
Although initial trunked systems utilized the 800 and 900 MHz frequencies, in February
1997, the Commission adopted a Second Report and Order, which allows some centralized
trunking in the shared private land mobile radio bands below 800 MHz.2 the FCC now allows
trunking on frequencies below 800 MHz if certain requirements are met (see Section 5.19),
including the 150-162 (high VHF), 421-430 (UHF), 450-470 (UHF), and 470-512 (UHF-T) MHz
bands.  The rules adopted in the Report and Order became effective October 17, 1997. [5]  For
most government and private users in the VHF band, commonly referred to as the public safety
pool and the industrial/business pool, trunking is not a common feature, since its implementation
was only approved so recently.

Hybrid Systems
As its name indicates, hybrid systems are a combination of conventional and trunked
systems.  A hybrid system offers both conventional and trunked user groups and features within a
single system.  There are two major reasons for hybrid architectures.  The first is cost.  It may not
be cost-effective to have a trunked site in an area with a few users; therefore, a conventional site
would be a better alternative, but the conventional site would be part of a system with trunked
portions serving areas with higher user density.  The second reason is call setup delay.  Because
immediate communication is critical for user groups such as public safety agencies, conventional
channels can be chosen to provide dedicated access with little or no call setup delay.  However,
large user organizations may include other user groups that are willing to accept the delay on
trunked channels to take advantage of the capacity increase provided by trunking.  Thus, a hybrid
system architecture would provide conventional and trunked overlays in one system.
To provide trunked channels, a hybrid system needs the same system components as a
trunked system.  A hybrid system can be configured as an overlay of a trunked system by one or
more conventional channels.  In this case, a conventional channel would represent a talk group
user to the trunked system logic.
User radios on a one-band hybrid system will be programmed to operate in either
conventional only, trunked only, or conventional and trunked mode.  Radios designated to
operate in both modes would require the user to select conventional or trunked mode prior to
establishing a call.  When in conventional mode, a user would monitor the conventional channel
and wait until it is free before attempting a call.  This is the same procedure required of users on
a conventional system.  It differs from a trunked channel allocation where the user and that
person’s user group are automatically allocated a channel, if one is available.  When in trunked
mode, a user depresses the PTT button to make a call request, and the system controller handles
the call as in a trunked system.

Exhibit 8.  A conventional radio user can communicate with the trunked User Group B by
selecting Channel 3 and vice versa: if a trunked user selects the trunked User Group B,  he or she
will also communicate with users of the conventional Channel 3.
