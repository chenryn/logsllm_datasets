User: Does anyone know if it is possible to use Coffeescript on Google App Engine?  If so how can this be done with the app engine Python or Go platforms?
Assistant: Coffeescript compiles to Javascript, which can be run in a web browser.  In that case, App Engine can serve up the resulting javascript.
I don't know of any way to compile coffeescript to python, java or go though, so you can't use it as a server side language.
