The drawer doesn't slide back into its original position when closed, it just
disappears (unmounts?) instead
  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
The drawer should slide back into the hidden position
## Current Behavior
The slider just unmounts / gets hidden without any animation
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
Go to https://material-ui.com/demos/drawers/ click on open left, then click
anywhere to dismiss it.
