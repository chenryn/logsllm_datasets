### Summary of System Log Chunk

This system log chunk, spanning from 18:09:23 to 18:09:28 on October 18th, documents several recurring issues related to address changes and lease renewals in a Hadoop environment. The key points are as follows:

1. **Address Changes**:
   - Multiple warnings indicate that the address for `msra-sa-41` has changed from `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:9000` to `msra-sa-41:9000` and from `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:8030` to `msra-sa-41:8030`. These changes are detected by the `org.apache.hadoop.ipc.Client` component.

2. **Lease Renewal Failures**:
   - The `org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.LeaseRenewer` component is failing to renew the lease for `DFSClient_NONMAPREDUCE_1537864556_1`. The failure duration increases over time, starting at 266 seconds and incrementing by one second each log entry. The system indicates that it will retry the lease renewal shortly.

3. **RMCommunicator Allocator Connection Attempts**:
   - The `org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.v2.app.rm.RMContainerAllocator` component is attempting to connect to the server at `msra-sa-41:8030`. Each attempt is logged with an informational message indicating that the connection is being retried. The retry policy is set to `RetryUpToMaximumCountWithFixedSleep` with a maximum of 10 retries and a sleep time of 1000 milliseconds between attempts.
   - Each connection attempt is followed by an error message, `ERROR IN CONTACTING RM`, indicating that the Resource Manager (RM) cannot be reached.

### Detailed Breakdown

- **Timestamps and Log Levels**:
  - The logs are timestamped every second from 18:09:23 to 18:09:28.
  - The log levels include `WARN`, `INFO`, and `ERROR`.

- **Components Involved**:
  - `org.apache.hadoop.ipc.Client`: Detects address changes.
  - `org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.LeaseRenewer`: Manages lease renewals.
  - `org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.v2.app.rm.RMContainerAllocator`: Handles communication with the Resource Manager.

- **Recurring Patterns**:
  - Address change warnings occur multiple times, suggesting a consistent issue with the server's address.
  - Lease renewal failures and connection attempts to the Resource Manager are repeated, indicating a persistent problem.

### Conclusion

The log entries highlight a series of address changes and ongoing issues with lease renewals and Resource Manager connectivity. The system is configured to retry both the lease renewals and the connection attempts, but these actions are not resolving the underlying problems. Further investigation into the network configuration and the state of the Resource Manager is recommended to address these issues.
