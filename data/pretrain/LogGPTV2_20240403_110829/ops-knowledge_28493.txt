User: I was configuring supervisor daemon to be able to start/stop Celery.
It did not work. After debuging back and forth I realized that the problem was that it did not change the working directory to the one mentioned in the directory option in supervisord.conf under program:celery configuration.
Hopefully there is a workdir in Celery but I am curious - what is the purpose of the directory option then?
Assistant: Directory option in supervisord = where we mention our project directory path.
Example:
directory="/home/celery/pictures/myapp"
