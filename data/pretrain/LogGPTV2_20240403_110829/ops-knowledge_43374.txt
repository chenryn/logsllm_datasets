User: I want to create a shortcut for IDLE on my mac so that I don't need to go through the terminal. Is there a way to do this? I was trying Automator but I'm not that familiar with it. 
Thanks.
Assistant: You can use spotlight to open IDLE: Press CMD (Apple) + SPACE, type "idle" and hit ENTER...
my preferred way to open any programs on the mac
