### Title: Botconf 2020: Fritzfrog - The Story of a Unique P2P Botnet

Botnets, as participants at Botconf are well aware, can vary significantly in their goals, tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), as well as in their implementations. However, most botnets share a common characteristic: they connect to a remote command-and-control (C2) server. By analyzing the C2 communication, researchers can gain valuable insights into the botnet's infrastructure, including where it is hosted, what malware is being distributed, and, with some luck, even identify the threat actors behind it.

When we first detected Fritzfrog in our sensor network, we initially assumed it was just another cryptomining botnet. As part of our standard research protocols, we began searching for the C2 servers. It took us a considerable amount of time to realize that we would not find these servers because they did not exist. Fritzfrog is a peer-to-peer (P2P) botnet.

In a P2P botnet, there is no centralized C2 server. Instead, control is distributed among the infected machines, or "nodes." Each node can communicate with its peers, exchanging targets, deploying binary files, running scripts remotely, and sharing logs. This decentralized structure makes P22 botnets more resilient and harder to disrupt.

The concept of P2P botnets is not new; however, their design and implementation require advanced skills, which is why they have traditionally been used by state-sponsored and advanced persistent threat (APT) groups. Fritzfrog demonstrates that this is no longer the case, as P2P botnets are now being employed by common cybercriminals to achieve their objectives, such as cryptomining and gaining unauthorized access to systems.
