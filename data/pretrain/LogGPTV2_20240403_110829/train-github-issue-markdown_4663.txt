Hello,

I would like to know if it is possible to define a prototype with multiple references within its definition. Below is an example of the structure I am aiming for:

```yaml
service: ServiceTest
version: 7
request:
    class: MyModel
    properties:
        # other configuration...
        Field3:
            type: collection
            field: fieldCollection
            properties:
                Field1:
                    type: string
                    field: fieldString
                Field2:
                    type: collection
                    field: fieldCollection
                    properties:
                        Field1:
                            type: boolean
                            field: fieldBoolean
                        Field2:
                            type: collection
                            field: fieldCollection
                            properties:
                                # ...
```

I have started writing my configuration, but I am unsure if it is possible to achieve what I want. Here is the current state of my configuration:

```php
$rootNode
    ->children()
        ->scalarNode('service')
            ->isRequired()
        ->end()
        ->scalarNode('version')
            ->isRequired()
        ->end()
        ->arrayNode('request')
            ->isRequired()
            ->children()
                ->scalarNode('class')->end()
                ->arrayNode('properties')
                    ->children()
                        ->useAttributeAsKey('name')
                        ->prototype('array')
                            ->children()
                                ->enumNode('type')
                                    ->values([
                                        ServiceProperty::TYPE_STRING,
                                        ServiceProperty::TYPE_INTEGER,
                                        ServiceProperty::TYPE_BOOLEAN,
                                        ServiceProperty::TYPE_COLLECTION
                                    ])
                                ->end()
                                ->scalarNode('field')
                                    ->isRequired()
                                ->end()
                                // Refers to the prototype
                            ->end()
                        ->end()
                    ->end()
                ->end()
            ->end()
        ->end()
    ;
```

Is this approach feasible? If not, could you please suggest an alternative?

Thank you.
