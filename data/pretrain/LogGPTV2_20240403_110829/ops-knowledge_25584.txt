Question: As an IT professional tasked with securing a Windows 10 environment, you need to protect against memory-based attacks and ensure that the operating system and applications can handle memory correctly. Which of the following features would you enable to maximize defense against such threats, and what are the potential consequences of implementing these protections?
"A": "Enabling Data Execution Prevention (DEP) to mark memory as non-executable, which could potentially interfere with the operation of some applications.",
"B": "Configuring UEFI Secure Boot to protect the boot process from tampering, but may prevent dual-boot scenarios with non-secure operating systems.",
"C": "Implementing Control Flow Guard (CFG) in applications, requiring no configuration in the operating system, thereby providing seamless protection.",
"D": "Activating Device Health Attestation (DHA) to ensure device integrity but may block devices that do not adhere to 'healthy' boot data profiles."
Answer: ABCD
