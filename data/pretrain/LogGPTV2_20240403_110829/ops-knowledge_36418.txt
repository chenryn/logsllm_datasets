User: I'm  making an application that supports multi language. And I am using gettext and locale to solve this issue. 
How to set LANG variable in Windows? In Linux and Unix-like systems it's just as simple as
$ LANG=en_US python appname.py
And it will automatically set the locale to that particular language. But in Windows, the
C:\>SET LANG=en_US python appname.py 
or 
C:\>SET LANG=en_US 
C:\>python appname.py
doesn't work.
Assistant: Windows locale support doesn't rely on LANG variable (or, indeed, any other environmental variable). It is whatever the user set it to in Control Panel.
