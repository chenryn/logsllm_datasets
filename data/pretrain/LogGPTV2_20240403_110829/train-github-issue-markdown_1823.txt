When there is an untitled window open with untitled buffer and `atom .`
command is used from shell, window is not restored properly (tree-view is
hidden and previously open buffers are not restored).
If there is no atom window open and `atom .` is used then window is propertly
restored.  
I am using Atom 124.0 on OS X Mavericks.
