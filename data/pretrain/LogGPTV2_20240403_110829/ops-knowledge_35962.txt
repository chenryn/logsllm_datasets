User: How to create a new user account on the Linux command line and set the corresponding access rights and passwords?
Assistant: 1. Use the adduser command to create a new user account: ``` sudo adduser username ``` where username is the username you want to create. 2. Set the new user's password: ``` sudo passwd username ``` Enter the new password twice and follow the prompts. 3. Add the user to the sudo group to have administrator privileges: ``` sudo usermod -aG sudo username ``` Note that replace username in the command with the username you created. 4. Set the user's access rights, for example, you can create and access a specific directory: ``` sudo mkdir /data sudo chown username:username /data sudo chmod 700 /data ``` Here we create a directory named /data , and set both its ownership and ownership group to the new user's username. We then set the permissions on that directory to allow only that user to read, write, and execute. After completing the above steps, the new user account has been created and has the corresponding access rights and password.
