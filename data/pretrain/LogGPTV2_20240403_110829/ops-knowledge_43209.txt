User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Targeted acoustic keylogging attack prevention To what level could this be applied to? Could someone record keystrokes on a keyboard and in combination with typing habits start to put together a picture of what the user is typing?

If this is indeed true what steps could the user take to help mitigate this?

I know that these attacks have been demonstrated in printers but I'm wondering to what extent could they be used?

Assistant: In my opinion acoustic cryptanalysis is more of a proof of concept then to be used in real applications. 

What is possible to do?

A few years ago guys from MIT (if I am not wrong) were able to log every keys on a mechanical keyboard using an Android/IOS phone application and just by placing that specific phone near the keyboard.

Things you can do to mitigate: 


Use on screen keyboard.
Ensure that there aren't any other device near your computer
Use Snowden type pillow even if it's a bit paranoia (or not)
Use smart card/ smart usb authentification
Randomly generate frequencies in the 400-12000 Hz range (which seems to be the one containing keystrokes sounds) and use headphones
