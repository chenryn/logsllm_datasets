### Summary of Observed Peering Relationships Between Tier-1 ISPs

Figure 9 illustrates the diversity of peering relationships among tier-1 ISPs. Both early- and late-exit policies are common, and they are not limited to a few ISPs. The figure shows that peering policies vary widely, even between neighbors of the same ISP. For example, ISPs like Telia and Global Crossing tend to use late exit more frequently than others.

Overall, this figure highlights the complexity of pairwise peering policies and demonstrates that "early-exit" is not a universal policy for routing between tier-1 ISPs.

### Asymmetry in Peering Policies

Our analysis revealed asymmetry in the peering policies used by ISPs, particularly in relation to their tier. Among the ISP pairs we characterized as early or late in both directions, the likelihood of a late exit policy was 17%, but the likelihood of reciprocal late exit was only 8%. Additionally, we observed asymmetry in the relationship between tier-1 and tier-2 ISPs. Specifically, 50% (82/178) of tier-1 to tier-2 peerings showed a late-exit policy, compared to only 36% (32/88) of tier-2 to tier-1 peerings. We found no significant differences in peering policies across different regions of the world.

### Case Study: AT&T and Sprint in San Francisco

Most peerings can be classified as either early or late, but some paths traverse peering links that are neither closest to the source nor closer to the destination. We examined a notable case between AT&T and Sprint in San Francisco, California. Only 38% of 14,649 paths took the early-exit peering in San Francisco, while the remaining 61% were routed to Seattle, Washington, 1,092 kilometers north. Many of these diverted paths eventually returned to San Francisco, making "late-exit" an unlikely explanation.

#### Impact on Path Latency

Figure 10 shows the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of additive inflation in paths leaving AT&Tâ€™s San Francisco point of presence (POP) for destinations in Sprint. The inflation is relative to optimal exit paths, as computed in Section 5.1. The graph compares the inflation in measured paths to the inflation that would result from an early-exit policy. While the early-exit policy would cause minimal path inflation, the observed routing sees at least 5 ms of inflation on most paths.

#### Load Balancing and Congestion

We hypothesized that AT&T engineers were diverting traffic away from a heavily loaded peering link. To test this, we measured congestion on the link between January 16 and January 24, 2003, using TTL-limited probes from PlanetLab sites in Seattle and Berkeley. The probes were sent in triplets every 50 seconds to avoid synchronization with router maintenance tasks. We verified that the responses came from the same router and that the return TTL was consistent.

We observed no queueing delay variation on the links before both peering links and on the Seattle peering link. However, the San Francisco peering link appeared to be loaded. Figure 11 shows the measured queueing delay at the link, with each dot representing the median delay over a four-hour period. The vertical bars correspond to midnight, Pacific time, on each day. The decrease in measured queueing delay almost every night strongly suggests that the delay is dependent on the load at the link.

### Impact of Peering Policies

#### Early- vs. Late-Exit

We found little difference in latency between early and late exit routing strategies. Figure 12 shows the CDF of inflation caused by early- and late-exit policies from Qwest to Genuity. Although Qwest implements a late-exit policy towards Genuity, in terms of path latency, early exit would have been just as good. This is not surprising, as the paths taken by late-exit are usually the reverse of those taken by early-exit. For the rest of this paper, we analyze peering policies using early-exit as representative of both early and late exit.

#### Early- vs. Optimal-Exit

Figure 13 compares the inflation caused by using early-exit routing relative to an ideal, optimal exit policy. Over 30% of the paths experience inflation, and the top 5% of the paths suffer an inflation of more than 12 ms. The right graph shows the inflation as a function of the latency of the optimal exit path, indicating that paths between cities close to each other can be highly inflated compared to the small distance between them. Unlike previous graphs, the additive inflation does not increase with the latency of the optimal path.

#### More Peering Points vs. Optimal-Exit

We also considered adding additional peering points between ISPs to determine whether an "optimal exit" policy might have the same effect as adding peering points. We focused on the topology of Sprint and AT&T, which have 11 peering points spread across the country. Figure 14 shows the results of our experiment, plotting the median and 95th percentile of additive inflation over the latency of a hypothetical direct link between the source and destination cities. With just two or three peering points, the inflation is high, but it decreases quickly as the number of peering points increases.

There is a 3 ms gap between the 95th percentiles of optimal- and early-exit routes. Surprisingly, the performance difference between early-exit and optimal-exit peering policies does not decrease with more peering points. This graph can also be read horizontally to show that the latency reduction offered by more peering points can be achieved using an optimal-exit policy.

### Inter-Domain Factors

In this section, we describe the path inflation along paths that traverse multiple ISPs. ISPs choose which other ISPs to connect with, forming the AS-graph that defines the paths in the network. Over this topology, ISPs make routing policy decisions that determine which paths are taken. These decisions are constrained by business relationships that may forbid good paths that exist in the topology. We aim to determine whether the topology, the protocol, or the policies create the inter-domain path inflation shown in Figure 1.

To estimate the path inflation contributed by inter-domain topology and policies, we constructed an abstract graph where nodes represent POPs and edges represent both the early-exit paths between ISPs and the least-weight paths between POPs in the same ISP. We computed shortest paths over this graph, first minimizing latency to show the effect of topology, then minimizing AS-hops to compare policies. We ensured that these shortest paths respected intra-domain and peering policies by using the intra-domain edge only at the end of the path. There are 100,799 edges connecting 2,084 nodes in this graph. Our results are consistent with previous studies of measured path inflation.
