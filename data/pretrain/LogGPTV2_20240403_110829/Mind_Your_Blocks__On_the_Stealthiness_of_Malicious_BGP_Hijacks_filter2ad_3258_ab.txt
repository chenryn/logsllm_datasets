they own. Other proposals aim at preventing BGP hijacks [24],
[25], [30] but their large-scale adoption and deployment are
hindered by the implementation cost.
In 2006, Ramachandran et al. [35] introduced a new
phenomenon called “BGP spectrum agility”, which consists of
spammers advertising for a short period of time (i.e., less than
one day) BGP routes to large (i.e., /8) previously unannounced
blocks of IP addresses and, subsequently, using the available
IP addresses for spamming. Later, some other authors also
identiﬁed the emission of spam emails coming from hijacked
preﬁxes [20], [23]. Furthermore, complementing the work done
in [39], we have described in [47] a special case of hijack
in which a couple of IP address blocks were stolen and used
to send spam. Most recently, we have also shown in [46],
thanks to another real-world case,
that correlating routing
anomalies with malicious trafﬁc, such as spam, is not sufﬁcient
to decisively prove the existence of a malicious BGP hijack.
Besides these sparse cases and despite the apparent desire
of some owners to detect whether their own IP address block
could ever be stolen, to the best of our knowledge we have
no documented evidence that BGP attacks are a threat worth
being investigated, since no one has shown that hackers have
the possibility to routinely use that modus operandi to commit
nefarious activities. If they were capable of it, this would
constitute a very serious threat to the Internet since this would
enable them not only to send spam emails while defeating
the classical IP blacklists but, more importantly, to run large
scale DDoS at almost no cost or run man-in-the-middle attacks
against almost any target of their choosing.
Therefore, we feel that there is a need to rigorously assess
the existence and prevalence of this potential threat. This paper
contributes to this objective by providing an in-depth study
of a speciﬁc class of agile spammers that are able to hijack
routinely, persistently and -quite likely- automatically a large
number of blocks of IP addresses to send spam from the stolen
IP space. What truly separates our work from others is that we
do not only uncover a large number of new suspicious cases
but we also gather contextual information to build a compelling
case for the reality of these malicious hijacks and to expose the
modus operandi of the malicious actors. Our results show that
the identiﬁed hijacks were rather successful at circumventing
traditional BGP hijack and spam protection techniques.
The main contribution of this paper is to be an eye-
opener to the fact that frequent, persistent and stealthy BGP
hijack attacks have taken place in the Internet for months or
even years. We achieve this by leveraging a large-scale data
collection system dubbed SPAMTRACER that we introduced
in [47]. This large dataset is then mined by means of a multi-
stage scoring and ﬁltering process, whose results are enriched
using external data sources and clustered in order to reveal the
modus operandi of the attackers.
Before moving into the core of the paper, we would like
to make it clear what this paper is not about:
•
•
•
This paper does not offer yet another BGP hijack
detection technique. We do not want to incrementally
improve the state of the art in that space. The novelty,
at the contrary, resides in the identiﬁed hijacks and in
their detailed analysis.
Along the previous point, we do not claim that we
have found all BGP hijacks that could have been
found in our dataset. What matters is that our results
must be seen as a proof of the existence of these
recurring attacks. Some of them were conﬁrmed by
an ISP who was unwittingly involved in several hijack
