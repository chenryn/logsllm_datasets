Other proposals aim to prevent BGP hijacks [24], [25], [30], but their widespread adoption and deployment are impeded by the high implementation costs.

In 2006, Ramachandran et al. [35] introduced a phenomenon termed "BGP spectrum agility." This involves spammers temporarily (i.e., for less than one day) advertising BGP routes to large (i.e., /8) previously unannounced IP address blocks, then using these addresses for spamming. Subsequently, other researchers have also identified spam email emissions from hijacked prefixes [20], [23]. Additionally, in [47], we described a specific case of BGP hijack where several IP address blocks were stolen and used to send spam. Most recently, in [46], we demonstrated that correlating routing anomalies with malicious traffic, such as spam, is insufficient to conclusively prove the existence of a malicious BGP hijack.

Despite these isolated instances and the apparent interest of some IP block owners in detecting potential theft, there is, to the best of our knowledge, no documented evidence that BGP attacks pose a significant threat. No one has shown that hackers can routinely use this method to carry out nefarious activities. If they could, it would represent a serious threat to the Internet, enabling them not only to send spam while evading traditional IP blacklists but also to conduct large-scale DDoS attacks at minimal cost or perform man-in-the-middle attacks on almost any target.

Therefore, there is a need to rigorously evaluate the existence and prevalence of this potential threat. This paper contributes to this objective by providing an in-depth study of a specific class of agile spammers capable of routinely, persistently, and likely automatically hijacking a large number of IP address blocks to send spam from the stolen IP space. Our work stands out because we not only uncover a large number of new suspicious cases but also gather contextual information to build a compelling case for the reality of these malicious hijacks and to expose the modus operandi of the attackers. Our results show that the identified hijacks were quite successful in circumventing traditional BGP hijack and spam protection techniques.

The primary contribution of this paper is to highlight the fact that frequent, persistent, and stealthy BGP hijack attacks have been occurring on the Internet for months or even years. We achieve this by leveraging a large-scale data collection system called SPAMTRACER, which we introduced in [47]. This extensive dataset is then analyzed through a multi-stage scoring and filtering process, enriched with external data sources, and clustered to reveal the attackers' methods.

Before delving into the core of the paper, it is important to clarify what this paper does not cover:
- This paper does not propose another BGP hijack detection technique. Our goal is not to incrementally improve the state of the art in this area. The novelty lies in the identified hijacks and their detailed analysis.
- We do not claim to have found all possible BGP hijacks in our dataset. What is significant is that our results provide evidence of the existence of these recurring attacks. Some of these findings were confirmed by an ISP that was inadvertently involved in several hijacks.
