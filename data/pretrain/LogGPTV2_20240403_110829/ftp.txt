**Applies to:**
- Windows Server 2022
- Windows Server 2019
- Windows Server 2016
- Windows Server 2012 R2
- Windows Server 2012

**Description:**
The `ftp` command is used to transfer files to and from a computer running an FTP server service. It can be used interactively or in batch mode by processing ASCII text files.

**Syntax:**
```sh
ftp [-v] [-d] [-i] [-n] [-g] [-s:filename] [-a] [-A] [-x:buffer_size] [-r:buffer_size] [-b:count] [-w:window_size] [host]
```

**Parameters:**

- **-v**: Suppresses the display of remote server responses.
- **-d**: Enables debugging, displaying all commands passed between the FTP client and FTP server.
- **-i**: Disables interactive prompting during multiple file transfers.
- **-n**: Suppresses auto-login upon initial connection.
- **-g**: Disables file name globbing. Glob allows the use of the asterisk (*) and question mark (?) as wildcard characters in local file and path names.
- **-s:filename**: Specifies a text file that contains FTP commands. These commands run automatically after FTP starts. This parameter does not allow spaces.
- **-a**: Disables ASCII mode, using binary mode instead.
- **-A**: Enables ASCII mode, which is the default.
- **-x:buffer_size**: Overrides the default SO_SNDBUF size of 8192 bytes.
- **-r:buffer_size**: Overrides the default SO_RCVBUF size of 8192 bytes.
- **-b:count**: Overrides the default asynchronous buffer count of 3.
- **-w:window_size**: Specifies the size of the transfer buffer. The default window size is 4096 bytes.
- **host**: Specifies the computer name, IP address, or IPv6 address of the FTP server to which to connect. If specified, it must be the last parameter on the line.
- **-?**: Displays help at the command prompt.

**Remarks:**
- FTP command-line parameters are case-sensitive.
- This command is available only if the Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) protocol is installed as a component in the properties of a network adapter in Network Connections.
- The `ftp` command can be used interactively. After it is started, `ftp` creates a sub-environment in which you can use FTP commands. You can return to the command prompt by typing the `quit` command. When the FTP sub-environment is running, it is indicated by the `ftp>` command prompt. For more information, see the FTP commands.
- The `ftp` command supports the use of IPv6 when the IPv6 protocol is installed.

**Examples:**

1. **To log on to the FTP server named `ftp.example.microsoft.com`:**
   ```sh
   ftp ftp.example.microsoft.com
   ```

2. **To log on to the FTP server named `ftp.example.microsoft.com` and run the FTP commands contained in a file named `resync.txt`:**
   ```sh
   ftp -s:resync.txt ftp.example.microsoft.com
   ```
