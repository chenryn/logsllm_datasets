#### Describe the bug
In version 0.19.1 my API worked for DELETE's against my .NET Core 3.1 API, but
after upgrading to 0.20.0 this broke.
#### To Reproduce
My ts code:
      public static async postDelete(payload: IAssetDeletionData): Promise {
        const response = await (await getApi(this.apiBase)).delete('', {
          data: payload
        });
        return response.data as IAssetDeletionResult;
      }
Works with Axios 0.19.1 but not in 0.20.0.  
I get a  
_{type: "https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.5.13", title:
"Unsupported Media Type",â€¦}  
status: 415  
title: "Unsupported Media Type"  
traceId: "|3670a9cf-44c6c31efd70086d."  
type: "https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.5.13"_
Downgrading to 0.19.1...it works again.
#### Expected behavior
Expect still to work in 0.20.0 and be backwards compatible (as version is non-
breaking according to NPM semantic versioning)
#### Environment
  * Axios Version 0.20.0
  * Browser Chrome
  * Browser Version 84.0.4147.135
  * Node.js Version 12.8.0
