### Title: BlackHat Asia 2022: The Hidden RCE Surfaces That Control the Droids

The Android operating system relies on a vast array of libraries to process incoming files through both standard APIs defined in the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) and self-developed APIs. These libraries are not only used for processing internal format files but also for handling files during the normal use of system applications, including those from untrusted sources such as MMS, chat apps, emails, web downloads, and files displayed or used in Gallery/Photos and Settings applications.

During our research, we discovered that AOSP and almost all mainstream Android devices expose previously overlooked remote attack surfaces, particularly in support of higher-definition images, complex media files, and specific configuration files in native code. Following this discovery, we identified dozens of memory corruption vulnerabilities in various file formats, including quram, spi, sdocx, and others. These vulnerabilities can be exploited to achieve 0-click or 1-click Remote Code Execution (RCE) on devices from different manufacturers and AOSP itself. All of these findings have been reported and confirmed by vendors, resulting in over 20 CVEs with High or Critical severity ratings from Google and other major manufacturers like Samsung.

In this presentation, we will delve into these new attack surfaces and explain how we uncovered the vulnerabilities through code auditing and fuzzing. We will also discuss our innovative approach to efficiently conducting binary fuzzing on closed-source libraries developed by vendors, a topic that has not been widely covered before. Additionally, we will share our work on analyzing and exploiting these vulnerabilities, including techniques for gaining control of the program counter (PC) and obtaining reverse shells.
