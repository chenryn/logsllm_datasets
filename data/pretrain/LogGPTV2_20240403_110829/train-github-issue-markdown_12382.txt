As a subset of issue #9875, we aim to redesign the static homepage located at http://www.rust-lang.org. 

Currently, @thehydroimpulse is actively developing a new version of the website, which can be found at https://github.com/TheHydroImpulse/rust-website. Additionally, @adridu59 has also been contributing to this effort through their work available at http://adridu59.github.io/rust-www/.

I am nominating these efforts for further discussion and support.

This revised version provides more context and clarity, while maintaining a professional tone.
