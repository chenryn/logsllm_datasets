I am getting duplicate `debugViews.ts` in recently opened. Both point to the
same file, however they seem to have a different editors associated with them
- eg selections are different.  
Not sure how I got in this state, but I this is the first time I get duplicate
entires. So my suspicion is that at a point of time the workbench created an
additional editor for a file that was already open
