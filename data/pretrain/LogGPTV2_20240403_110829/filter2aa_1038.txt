## Introduction
### Who are we?
Our team consists of experienced security professionals and software engineers dedicated to exploring the vulnerabilities in network-controlled embedded devices, commonly found in smart homes.

## The “Smart” Home: Science Fiction Becomes Reality
The rapid development and release of novel smart home products often come at the expense of robust security measures. In this presentation, we will explore a variety of these devices, attempting to exploit their vulnerabilities. While we will not cover every product, we will provide a comprehensive overview of several key devices, including:
- Android-powered ovens
- Smart TVs
- IP security cameras
