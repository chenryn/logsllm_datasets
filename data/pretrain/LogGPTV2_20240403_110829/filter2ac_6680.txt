**ATT&CK ID:** T1481.001  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Dead Drop Resolver

Adversaries may leverage legitimate, external web services to host information that directs victims to additional command and control (C2) infrastructure. This technique involves posting content, referred to as a "dead drop resolver," on these web services. The content often contains embedded, and frequently obfuscated or encoded, domains or IP addresses. Once a victim's system is compromised, it will contact the dead drop resolver, which then redirects the system to the adversary's C2 infrastructure.
