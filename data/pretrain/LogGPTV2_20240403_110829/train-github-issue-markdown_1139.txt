There seems to have been a recent regression in the placement of the cursor
and end-of-line marker on lines with accented characters. For example
ὤὤὤὤὤὤὤὤὤὤ
Has ten _characters_ but if you ctrl-E to the end of the line the cursor is in
the wrong place:

This may seem obscure but is making it very difficult to use Atom for natural
language processing applications with non-ASCII character sets. It worked
fairly recently so is likely a recent regression.
