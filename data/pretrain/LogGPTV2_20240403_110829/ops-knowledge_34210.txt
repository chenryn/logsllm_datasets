User: I realize I'm probably just dumb and missing something big and important, but I can't figure out how to specify a timeout in twisted using reactor.listenUDP. My goal is to be able to specify a timeout, and after said amount of time, if DatagramProtocol.datagramReceived has not been executed, have it execute a callback or something that I can use to call reactor.stop(). Any help or advice is appreciated. Thanks
Assistant: A better way to do this is with twisted.protocols.policies.TimeoutMixin.  It's essentially doing a callLater but abstracted into a Mixin.
