 **Migrated issue, originally created by RÃ©my Roy (@remyroy)**
IF EXISTS and IF NOT EXISTS are already part of many DBMSs DDL vocabulary.
They have many use cases which are highly useful in some situations.
For instance, creating a table if it does not already exists or dropping a
column if it exists.
It would be nice to have those directives with standard SQLAlchemy DDL
methods. I guess they could be implemented using the native support for DBMSs
that support them or with some introspection for those that do not.
