cyber-insurance firms, the measure of their accuracy as a standalone
tool for defining the security posture —and as a step further the risk
— of an organization is still questionable. A recent work examines
24 application forms to determine whether the collection of security
checks referred by technical questions corresponds to the controls
defined in two well-known standards of security best practices [165].
As result, existing forms are found to be predominantly focused on a
small range of controls and the authors suggest how to extend them
to be in alignment with the two information security frameworks.
Nevertheless, the extent to which security standards compliance
reflect the level of risk a company faces has not been yet understood
(cid:3)R12(cid:4).
As suggested by modern approaches for data collection about
cyber-insurance applicants [50], cyber questionnaires should be
only one of many tools employed by insurance firms. For instance,
instead of relying on self-assessment, the security posture of an
organization can be automatically refined using two types of data
sources: (i) internal data, provided by monitoring and telemetry
tools installed inside the subject under investigation; and (ii)
external data, collected from publicly available databases or by
scanning Internet-facing services.
Although recent works show the feasibility of both ap-

proaches [20], [25], open questions still exist on both sides. In-
tuitively, internal data (if available) should provide a better accuracy
to understand the cybersecurity risks of an organization. However,
organizations do not exist in the void and the outcomes of internal
telemetry analysis could be insufficient when assessing the security
posture of an entity that maintains relationships or dependencies
with external subjects – thus requiring a combination of the two ap-
proaches to cover unavailable information about these third parties.
On the other hand, in a cyber-insurance scenario, internal data
could be unavailable to the insurer, who needs to base his evaluation
on external data only. In this respect, the effectiveness of methods
based on such sources only is not known, neither conditions
and circumstances in which they can be used to achieve a good
accuracy. As already depicted in Table II, studies that use external
indicators to predict risk also validate their findings based on
externally available ground truth. This is a big limitation, as cyber
incidents are insufficiently reported and records, even if available,
are often published too late and miss details and key elements.
Moreover, the different precision and granularity of the ground truth
make impossible to compare the results with those obtained with
internal indicators. More research is therefore needed to compare
the accuracy and relationship of externals indicators and internal
telemetry information on the same dataset (cid:3)R13(cid:4). In particular,
no previous work has provided insights on a combined use of both
sources, trying to answer the question whether internal data can serve
as ground truth for refining the power of external indicators (cid:3)R14(cid:4).
VII. AREA 3: CATASTROPHE MODELING
“One key challenge is accumulation. [. . . ] We know we can write
earthquake exposures in both Japan and California with the confi-
dence that the same event will not impact all these exposures at once.
We know to be wary of writing two industrial risks along the same
river basin, and the role flood defenses play in mitigating loss. With
cyber risks, the contours of systemic accumulation are not as clear”
– Hemant Shah, Risk Management Solutions [59].
For an insurance company, catastrophe modeling (or simply
cat modeling) is a way to estimate the likelihood or frequency at
which catastrophes can occur and to what extent they can impact
the insurance. To decrease the likelihood of cyber catastrophes, a
typical solution that is widely adopted is client diversification. The
assumption here is that if the clients of the insurance company have
diverse attack surfaces and diverse characteristics, a potential new
zero-day vulnerability will not exist in all of them, leaving only a
percentage of insureds affected by a possible cyber attack. While
this may seem a reasonable conclusion, a recent unpublished work
from Eling and Schnell [166] suggested that, when modeling losses
with specific distributions, diversification may not be a good idea
because of the heavy-tailed distribution nature of cyber risks. This
would be an important and counter-intuitive finding, that needs to
be confirmed by further measurements (cid:3)R15(cid:4).
At its core, cat modeling boils down to capturing and modeling
dependencies among different entities. This, in turn, translates into
the identification of the dependencies that come from the software,
hardware, and services used by a company. However, obtaining such
detailed and comprehensive information about a large enterprise is
a very challenging task. Moreover, because of the cyber-insurance
context and the transitive nature of these dependencies, this task
would need to be performed by using publicly available datasets.
This makes the problem even more complex and hence, we believe,
it opens new directions for researchers to explore and contribute.
In an ideal scenario where all companies reveal the software, hard-
ware, and services they use and share with the community, building
the service dependency graph, identifying the nodes in this graph that
might cause catastrophic events, and calculating the indirect risk that
comes from these dependencies would be a simple task. However,
even in such a perfect world, the dynamicity of the graph would
require to continuously report and recalculate the risk and likelihood
of the existing catastrophes and the identification of new catastrophe
scenarios. In other domains, if two risks are not connected (such as
a fire hazard on two areas tens of thousands of miles apart) this fact
is not likely to change in the near future. But in the cyber-insurance
domain, the relationships among two different companies are often
very ephemeral – as services providers and software libraries may
change very often. But as of now, there is no existing work that
studied how the dynamicity of the ecosystem could influence the
whole cat modeling topic and whether (and how often) the portfolios
defined by the insurance companies should also be updated (cid:3)R16(cid:4).
Moreover, the reality is far from this ideal scenario and even the
topic of building adequately accurate service dependency graphs
and modeling the catastrophes with sparse and incomplete data
are research topics that need more attention from the community
(cid:3)R17(cid:4). Altogether, this can lead to a supply chain risk analysis that
would provide a principled foundation for catastrophe modeling.
However, the identification of all services used by a company, es-
pecially without its cooperation, is often infeasible. For instance, the
presence of backup or redundancy services can remain undetected,
as those only come into play when the primary provider fails. As a
full and precise view of all the dependencies of a company may be
impossible to obtain, then a modeling algorithm should be able to
work with incomplete information, potentially inferring the missing
connections from settings and relations observed elsewhere (cid:3)R18(cid:4).
Although not done particularly for the cyber-insurance domain, there
exist two works [161], [167] that aimed at building dependency
graphs of popular companies by using public datasets such RIPE
atlas, passive DNS records, and web crawling data. In 2017,
Dell’amico et al [161] performed a large-scale study to identify the
dependencies between websites and Internet services. The findings
of the study confirm the monopoly problem in the current service
ecosystem. To make matters worst, over time the Internet appears to
be loosing its decentralized nature and the popularity of the few dom-
inant providers is steadily increasing. In the same year, Simeonovski
et. al [167] built a service dependency graph to explore what per-
centage of the Internet would be effected when a popular provider is
attacked. The study found that by only targeting a handful of service
providers it would be possible to take down 23% of the websites.
Another challenge that affects cat modeling is the lack of
a mapping procedure to reliably associate measurements and
public data to organizations. Network scans, web crawlers, service
monitoring systems, public blacklist, and other techniques that
can be used to identify the software and technologies adopted

by a company typically work at the level of domain names or IP
addresses. On the contrary, incident reports and risk prediction
operate at a company granularity. Sadly, the connection between the
two is not always straightforward and new techniques are needed to
link the two information (cid:3)R19(cid:4). For instance, Liu et al. [20] explain
their attempt to perform a manual mapping and all the difficulties
and caveats encountered in the process, making it evident the
necessity of a clearer and automated procedure.
VIII. AREA 4: FORENSIC ANALYSIS
“I often think of the 1990s as the decade of prevention, the 2000 as
the decade of detection, and this is the decade of incident response.”
– Bruce Schneier, Security Specialist
After the detection of a cyber incident, the response phase
requires the intervention of computer security experts to analyze
and understand the detail of the event. However, computer security
skills are not only required for helping the company to recover from
the incident but also, from an insurer’s perspective, to verify the
claim, assess the damage, and confirm whether it is covered by the
subscriber’s policy. Indeed, forensic investigations are the norm to
assess if, and to which extent, the insurance is liable for the event.
Computer forensics is a broad research field that covers the
collection, analysis, and preservation of digital evidence. It is a
highly developed science with its own language, modus operandi,
and standardized procedures [168]. However, while the other
research topics discussed in this paper have all been recently
contextualized (in terms of specific problems and new challenges)
to the cyber-insurance domain, no study has looked at the problem
of computer forensics from a cyber-insurance perspective.
For instance, one aspect that may require special attention is
information forgery. In traditional insurance sectors, fake accidents
cost over 30 billion dollars per year, with several insurers reporting
these frauds to account for up to 20% of claims costs [169]. However,
while set-up wrecks and burning houses are sadly common practice
for fraudsters to cash the insurance coverages, there is almost no
mention to date about similar frauds in the cyber domain.
Current forensic approaches are mainly concerned with the
possibility that an attacker can hide undetected or that important
evidence and artifacts can be deleted or manipulated. In other words,
the focus on evasion and not on forgery. The lack of motivation
can explain why planting fake evidence in a computer system is
not yet very common, but forged incidents are extremely easy to
set up for anyone with average programming skills [170]. The vast
majority of the indicator of compromise used today rely on the
simple existence of filesystem and registry artifacts - without any
knowledge of how (and by whom) the data was created in the first
place. In this setting, it is not hard to mimic a malware infection
or even a targeted attack against an organization. However, with
cyber insurances becoming more and more common, forged digital
evidence may become a major problem in the future.
In particular, digital evidence forgery could help businesses to
overcome one of the cyber-insurance most-common pitfalls: the
fact that technicalities can invalidate coverage allowing insurance
carriers to deny indemnity payments [171]. For instance, cyber
insurance does not normally cover when employee errors (e.g.,
falling for phishing attacks) are the cause of a malware infection
(e.g., ransomware) [172]. Since these events are instead covered
under other clauses (e.g., malware installed by an external attacker),
forging digital evidence would allow to “fake” a botnet infection
to fall within the scenario covered by the insurance policy, thus
allowing the victim to cash the indemnity.
Since today staging fake security incidents requires very little
effort, researchers should not only study how to collect hidden signs
of compromise, but also how to double-check and validate their
authenticity (cid:3)R20(cid:4).
IX. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper we discussed the unique challenges that affect the
cyber-insurance sector. We focus on a pure technical perspective,
highlighting the limitations of current approaches, evaluating the
feasibility of new solutions, and proposing research areas in which
system and network security experts can play a fundamental role
for the development of cyber insurance. Differently from legacy
frameworks based on qualitative approaches for risk assessment and
data collection, we endorse the relevance of prediction techniques
based on objective measures and automatic feature gathering.
