### Cyber-Insurance Firms and the Accuracy of Security Posture Assessment

The accuracy of cyber-insurance firms in defining an organization's security posture and, by extension, its risk, remains questionable when relying solely on existing tools. A recent study analyzed 24 application forms to determine if the security checks referenced in technical questions align with the controls defined in two well-known security best practices standards [165]. The findings revealed that these forms predominantly focus on a limited range of controls, and the authors suggested ways to extend them to better align with the information security frameworks. However, the extent to which compliance with security standards reflects an organization's actual risk level is still not fully understood (R12).

### Modern Approaches for Data Collection

Modern approaches for data collection about cyber-insurance applicants [50] suggest that cyber questionnaires should be just one of many tools used by insurance firms. Instead of relying solely on self-assessment, the security posture of an organization can be more accurately refined using two types of data sources: (i) internal data, provided by monitoring and telemetry tools installed within the organization; and (ii) external data, collected from publicly available databases or through scanning Internet-facing services.

Recent studies have shown the feasibility of both approaches [20], [25], but several open questions remain. Intuitively, internal data, if available, should provide a higher level of accuracy in understanding an organization's cybersecurity risks. However, organizations do not exist in isolation, and the analysis of internal telemetry may be insufficient when assessing the security posture of entities with external relationships or dependencies. This necessitates a combination of both internal and external data to cover the information gaps related to third parties.

In a cyber-insurance scenario, internal data may not always be accessible to the insurer, who must then base their evaluation on external data alone. The effectiveness of methods based solely on external data is not yet fully known, nor are the conditions under which they can achieve a good level of accuracy. As depicted in Table II, studies that use external indicators to predict risk often validate their findings based on externally available ground truth. This is a significant limitation, as cyber incidents are often underreported, and even when records are available, they are frequently published too late and lack critical details. Additionally, the varying precision and granularity of the ground truth make it challenging to compare results obtained from internal and external indicators. Therefore, further research is needed to compare the accuracy and relationship of external indicators and internal telemetry information on the same dataset (R13). Specifically, no prior work has explored the combined use of both data sources to determine whether internal data can serve as a ground truth for refining the power of external indicators (R14).

### Catastrophe Modeling in Cyber-Insurance

Catastrophe modeling (cat modeling) is a method used by insurance companies to estimate the likelihood and frequency of catastrophes and their potential impact on insurance. To mitigate the risk of cyber catastrophes, client diversification is a commonly adopted solution. The assumption is that if the clients of an insurance company have diverse attack surfaces and characteristics, a new zero-day vulnerability will not affect all of them, thereby limiting the impact of a potential cyber attack. However, a recent unpublished work by Eling and Schnell [166] suggests that diversification may not be effective due to the heavy-tailed distribution nature of cyber risks. This counter-intuitive finding needs further validation (R15).

At its core, cat modeling involves capturing and modeling dependencies among different entities, which translates into identifying the dependencies arising from the software, hardware, and services used by a company. Obtaining such detailed and comprehensive information about a large enterprise is a challenging task, especially in the context of cyber-insurance and the transitive nature of these dependencies. This task would need to be performed using publicly available datasets, making the problem even more complex. In an ideal scenario where all companies disclose the software, hardware, and services they use, building a service dependency graph and identifying nodes that could cause catastrophic events would be straightforward. However, the dynamic nature of the graph would require continuous reporting and recalculating of risks and the identification of new catastrophe scenarios. In other domains, the relationships between risks are relatively stable, but in the cyber-insurance domain, the relationships among different companies are often ephemeral, as service providers and software libraries change frequently. There is currently no existing work that has studied how the dynamicity of the ecosystem influences cat modeling and how often portfolios defined by insurance companies should be updated (R16).

Moreover, the reality is far from this ideal scenario, and the construction of accurate service dependency graphs and the modeling of catastrophes with sparse and incomplete data are areas that require more attention from the research community (R17). This can lead to a supply chain risk analysis that provides a principled foundation for catastrophe modeling. However, the identification of all services used by a company, especially without its cooperation, is often infeasible. For example, backup or redundancy services may go undetected until the primary provider fails. Therefore, a modeling algorithm should be able to work with incomplete information and infer missing connections from observed settings and relations (R18).

Although not specifically designed for the cyber-insurance domain, there are two works [161], [167] that aimed to build dependency graphs of popular companies using public datasets such as RIPE Atlas, passive DNS records, and web crawling data. In 2017, Dell’amico et al. [161] conducted a large-scale study to identify dependencies between websites and Internet services, confirming the monopoly problem in the current service ecosystem. Simeonovski et al. [167] built a service dependency graph to explore the percentage of the Internet that would be affected if a popular provider were attacked, finding that targeting a handful of service providers could take down 23% of websites.

Another challenge in cat modeling is the lack of a reliable mapping procedure to associate measurements and public data with organizations. Techniques such as network scans, web crawlers, and public blacklists typically operate at the level of domain names or IP addresses, while incident reports and risk predictions operate at the company level. The connection between the two is not always straightforward, and new techniques are needed to link this information (R19). For instance, Liu et al. [20] highlighted the difficulties and caveats encountered in manually mapping this information, emphasizing the need for clearer and automated procedures.

### Forensic Analysis in Cyber-Insurance

Forensic analysis is crucial after the detection of a cyber incident, requiring the intervention of computer security experts to analyze and understand the event. From an insurer's perspective, forensic investigations are essential to verify claims, assess damage, and confirm coverage. While computer forensics is a well-developed field with its own language, modus operandi, and standardized procedures [168], no study has yet examined the problem of computer forensics from a cyber-insurance perspective.

One aspect that may require special attention is information forgery. In traditional insurance sectors, fake accidents cost over $30 billion per year, with some insurers reporting that frauds account for up to 20% of claims costs [169]. While physical frauds like staged wrecks and arson are common, there is little mention of similar frauds in the cyber domain. Current forensic approaches focus on detecting hidden or manipulated evidence rather than forgery. With the increasing prevalence of cyber insurance, forged digital evidence could become a major problem. Digital evidence forgery could help businesses overcome common pitfalls in cyber insurance, such as technicalities that invalidate coverage, allowing insurance carriers to deny indemnity payments [171]. For example, cyber insurance typically does not cover employee errors, but forging digital evidence could allow a victim to claim coverage under a different clause, such as a botnet infection (R20).

### Conclusions

This paper discusses the unique challenges facing the cyber-insurance sector, focusing on a technical perspective. We highlight the limitations of current approaches, evaluate the feasibility of new solutions, and propose research areas where system and network security experts can play a fundamental role in the development of cyber insurance. Unlike legacy frameworks based on qualitative approaches for risk assessment and data collection, we advocate for prediction techniques based on objective measures and automatic feature gathering.
