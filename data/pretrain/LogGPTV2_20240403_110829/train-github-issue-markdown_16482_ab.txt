    # Aleck Landgraf - Elasticsearch 1.5.1 aggs tests with various mappings
    # This test will return 0 or null aggregations for elasticsearch version 1.5.1
    # and return valid aggs on 1.4.4. See output at the bottom.
    #
    # Comment out line 35 (mapping of building_snapshot) to work on 1.5.1.
    #
    # I've only tested for the value_counts and stats aggs, but more are probably
