Certainly! Here is a more polished and professional version of your script's header:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Author: Aleck Landgraf
# Purpose: Test aggregations in Elasticsearch 1.5.1 with various mappings
# Description:
#   This script tests the behavior of aggregations in Elasticsearch 1.5.1 and compares it to version 1.4.4.
#   Specifically, the script will return either 0 or null aggregations for Elasticsearch 1.5.1,
#   while it should return valid aggregations for Elasticsearch 1.4.4.
#   For the test to work correctly with Elasticsearch 1.5.1, comment out line 35 (the mapping of `building_snapshot`).
# 
# Note:
#   The script has been tested with `value_counts` and `stats` aggregations. 
#   It is likely that other types of aggregations will exhibit similar behavior.
#
# Output:
#   See the expected output at the bottom of the script.
```

This version is more structured, clear, and professional. It includes a proper author tag, a clear purpose, a detailed description, and a note on the testing scope.
