# Anti-Forensics Techniques and Mitigation Strategies

## Introduction
This presentation aims to explore various anti-forensic techniques and provide mitigation strategies. The goal is to help forensic investigators identify and counteract these tactics, ensuring the integrity of their investigations.

## Sequential Log Files
### Overview
Sequential log files are crucial for identifying timelines in digital forensics. They can show multiple sets of similar times and help in determining the order of events.

### Key Points
- **Log Analysis**: Sequential log files can help identify timelines by showing sets of similar times.
- **BIOS Time Changes**: The BIOS time was changed twice, which can be a red flag.
- **Malicious MACE Times**: When all timestamps are scrambled, it indicates that the values should be ignored.
- **Investigative Reporting**: Investigators should cite consistent times in their reports, such as "Logs show it occurred at this time."

### Example
- **Duration**: 44 hours
- **Cost**: $13,200

## Confounding File Analysis
### Overview
The process of separating relevant data from irrelevant data (wheat from chaff) is essential in forensic analysis.

### Steps
1. **Process Data for Analysis**
2. **Analyze Data for Relevance**
3. **Prepare Report on Findings**
4. **Archive Data for Future**
5. **Create Working Copy**

### Example
- **Duration**: 44 hours
- **Cost**: $13,200

## Restricted Filenames
### Overview
Windows 7 still retains some DOS-era restrictions on filenames, which can be used to frustrate investigators.

### Key Points
- **Restricted Filenames**: CON, PRN, AUX, NUL, COM1, COM2, COM3, LPT1, LPT2, etc.
- **Creation Methods**:
  - Access NTFS volume via UNC path: `\\host\C$\Folder`
  - Use Windows API function `MoveFile` manually from a custom app.
  - Boot from Linux with NTFS support and use `mv` command.

### Mitigation
- **Exporting Files**: Never export files with native filenames; always specify a different name.
- **FTK 4 Default**: FTK 4 does this by default (e.g., `1.jpg`).
- **FileID or Auto-Generated Names**: Export by FileID or other automatically generated names.

### Example
- **Duration**: 1 hour
- **Cost**: $300

## Circular References
### Overview
Circular references in file paths can cause programs to enter infinite loops or throw exceptions.

### Key Points
- **NTFS Limit**: Folders in folders have a typical limit of 255 characters.
- **Junctions/Symbolic Links**: Can point to a parent directory, creating circular references.
- **Affected Tools**: Many tools that recursively scan folders are affected, including those used in field triage and remote analysis.

### Mitigation
- **Work from an Image**: Always work from an image.
- **Be Mindful of Attacks**: Be aware of this attack when dealing with a live system.

### Example
- **Duration**: 4 hours
- **Cost**: $1,200

## Broken Log Files
### Overview
Log files can be manipulated to make parsing difficult.

### Key Points
- **Characters**: Use special characters like commas, quotes, and pipes to make parsing difficult.
- **eLfL Header**: Use `eLfL` (0x654c664c) in Windows Event Logs to confuse parsers.

### Mitigation
- **Manual Parsing**: Parse the few pertinent records manually and document your methodology.
- **Custom Scripts**: Write a small app/script to parse the log as needed.

### Example
- **Duration**: 6 hours
- **Cost**: $1,800

## Lotus Notes
### Overview
Lotus Notes NSF files and their .id files can be challenging to handle.

### Key Points
- **NSF Files**: Hold emails, similar to PST files.
- **ID Files**: Include a user ID and an encryption key that can be unlocked with the user's password.
- **Password Dialog**: Raised in an interactive context, making automation difficult.

### Mitigation
- **Training**: Train yourself on Lotus Notes itself.
- **Manual Processing**: Load up each NSF manually and deal with it using your own keyboard and mouse.

### Example
- **Duration**: 6 hours
- **Cost**: $1,800

## Hash Collisions
### Overview
MD5 and SHA1 hashes can be manipulated to create collisions, leading to unexpected results.

### Key Points
- **Dummy Data**: Add dummy data to criminal files to match known good files.
- **Research**: Marc Stevens' 2008 paper on hash collisions is a key reference.

### Mitigation
- **Use Stronger Hashes**: Use hash functions with fewer collisions (e.g., SHA256, Whirlpool).
- **Double-Check**: Always double-check your findings by opening each matched file.

### Example
- **Duration**: 2 hours
- **Cost**: $600

## Dummy HDD
### Overview
Using a dummy hard drive can simulate regular usage and mislead investigators.

### Key Points
- **Daemon/Service**: Retrieve news webpages and write cache to the HDD, sync mail with a benign/legit mail account, and execute at random intervals.
- **Recent Entries**: As long as the HDD has 'recent' entries, the investigator will think it's been used recently.

### Mitigation
- **Check USB Slots**: Always check for USB drives in USB slots and on motherboards.
- **Network Traffic Monitoring**: Monitor network traffic before seizure to detect remote drive locations.

### Example
- **Duration**: 3 hours
- **Cost**: $900

## Data Saturation
### Overview
Increasing the amount of data can make it more difficult for investigators to manage and analyze.

### Key Points
- **Budget Overrun**: Extra time spent trying to image drives, export files, read email, and perform other menial tasks.
- **Increased Likelihood of Settlement**: Opposing counsel may settle due to the increased workload.

### Example
- **Duration**: 1 hour
- **Cost**: $20/mo per HDD
- **Annual Cost**: 3 HDDs per year = $720
