**User:**
I have Eclipse set up with PyDev and I really appreciate the ability to debug my scripts and applications. I have recently started exploring Pylons and was wondering if there is a way to start the paster server through Eclipse so that I can debug my web application.

**Assistant:**
Yanjost's approach is correct. I would like to add that you should ensure you do not use the `--reload` option. Using this option will prevent the debugger from properly attaching, which can cause your breakpoints to fail. This is a minor detail, but it can make a significant difference in your debugging experience.
