## Abstract

Cybercrime markets facilitate the development and dissemination of new attack technologies, vulnerability exploits, and malware. While the revenue streams of cyber attackers have been extensively studied, there is a lack of quantitative research on the economics of acquiring and deploying attacks. Understanding these economic factors is crucial for characterizing the production of traded exploits, the economy driving it, and its impact on the overall attack landscape. This paper presents an empirical investigation into the economics of vulnerability exploitation and the influence of market factors on the likelihood of exploit deployment. We collected data directly from a prominent Russian cybercrime market where the most active attack tools reported by the security industry are traded. Our findings indicate that underground exploits are priced similarly to or higher than vulnerabilities in legitimate bug-hunting programs, and the refresh cycle of exploits is slower than commonly assumed. However, cybercriminals are becoming more efficient at introducing selected vulnerabilities, and the market is expanding in terms of participants, traded exploits, and pricing. We also evaluate the impact of these market variables on the likelihood of attack realization, finding strong evidence of a correlation between market activity and exploit deployment. We discuss the implications of our findings on vulnerability metrics, economics, and exploit measurement.

## 1 Introduction

The rapid expansion of the cyber-threat landscape is fueled by an underground economy that supports the development, deployment, and monetization of cyber-attacks [35, 36]. Several studies have analyzed the dynamics of this underground economy and the markets that drive it [8, 36, 37], focusing on either the economic mechanisms enabling market activity [8, 37] or the real-world effects of such activities [15, 36]. However, a comprehensive characterization of the underground production of cyber-attacks remains incomplete without a quantitative analysis of its economic aspects. For instance, there are numerous claims about the costs of exploits in the underground markets, and the "economy of malware" is thought to significantly influence the occurrence of real-world attacks. Yet, no scientific account of this relationship currently exists in the literature. Similarly, legitimate vulnerability markets [63, 77] have been designed to compete with cybercrime markets, but a precise comparison is challenging without a detailed understanding of their economic dimensions. This paper aims to fill this gap by examining the economic aspects of exploit acquisition and deployment, providing a critical piece of the cybercrime puzzle.

One reason for the scarcity of such analyses is the difficulty in identifying and studying influential underground markets. Criminal markets often face economic challenges that hinder fair trade and market development [37, 69]. Additionally, markets trading attack technologies tend to be highly segregated [8, 68, 69, 75], making access and study more challenging. Common segregation mechanisms include pull-in mechanisms, language barriers (especially Russian, Portuguese, and Chinese), and ingress monitoring [8]. Non-English-speaking attackers, particularly those from Russia, generate a significant fraction of attacks [43, 78]. This may be due to the relatively loose international regulation of cyberspace [44] and economic and social factors in developing countries [25, 49, 50]. For example, Russian cybercriminals often avoid targeting ex-Soviet nations (ex-CIS) to evade local authorities. A substantial portion of the malware detected at scale, as well as attack vectors like exploit kits and booter services [35, 42, 48], are suspected to be engineered by Russian attackers [43, 48, 70].

In this paper, we analyze the economic aspects of vulnerability exploits traded in a prominent Russian cybercrime market (RuMarket) for user infections at scale. We correlate this data with Symantec's data on exploits detected at scale. Our main contributions are:

1. **Reactivity and Market Growth:** The time between vulnerability disclosure and the appearance of an exploit in RuMarket is decreasing, indicating that attackers are becoming more reactive in delivering selected exploits. The number of actors and traded exploits is increasing, and exploit prices are rising. Exploit-as-a-service models are reducing exploitation costs, which has significant implications for economic and risk modeling.
   
2. **Market Activity and Exploit Deployment:** We find strong evidence that market activity correlates with the likelihood of exploit deployment in the wild. Exploits that generate high levels of discussion in RuMarket are more likely to be deployed, while high market prices can deter large-scale deployment. This provides a quantitative link between attacker economics and attack realization, contributing to the development of more realistic attacker models.

3. **Exploit Pricing and Dynamics:** Exploit prices in the underground market are comparable to or higher than those in legitimate markets, ranging from $150 to $8,000. The introduction of new exploits is slower than often assumed, providing insights into the incentives for participating in the underground economy and the dynamics of exploit introduction.

**Scope of Work:** This paper focuses on one prominent Russian cybercrime market to provide insights into exploit economics. It does not aim to enumerate all exploits traded in the underground, as other markets may feature different sets of exploits and enforce different regulations. RuMarket does not focus on zero-day exploits, which are outside the scope of this work.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses related work, Section 3 outlines the methodology and data collection, Section 4 presents the analysis, and Section 5 discusses the results.

## 2 Related Work

The economics and development of underground markets have been explored in various studies. Franklin et al. [33] were among the first to tackle this topic. Herley et al. [37] highlighted that the lack of effective rule enforcement mechanisms in cybercrime markets can hinder fair trading and market sustainability. Other studies have analyzed the evolution of cybercrime markets [8, 23, 35, 53, 68, 75] and provided estimates of malware development [22] and attack likelihood [11]. However, there is a lack of quantitative research on economic factors such as exploit pricing and adoption [22, 63]. This paper addresses this gap by providing the first empirical quantification of these economic aspects using data from a prominent cybercrime market.

Recent work has examined the services and monetization schemes of cybercriminals, such as money laundering through the acquisition of expensive goods [36] and renting infected systems [35, 42]. The technological means by which these attacks are carried out remain relatively unexplored [63], with some technical insights provided by industrial reports [43, 70]. Studies have also estimated the economic impact of cybercrime activities on the real-world economy, including the monetization of stolen credit cards and banking information [15], profits from spam campaigns [45], registration of fake online accounts [71], and the provision of booter services for DDoS attacks [47]. However, a detailed characterization of the costs of the technology and the relationship between trade factors and attack realization is still lacking. This work provides insights into the value of vulnerability exploits in the underground market and the impact of market factors on the occurrence of attacks.

The presence of a cybercrime economy that absorbs vulnerabilities and generates attacks has motivated the security community to develop legitimate vulnerability markets to attract security researchers away from illegal marketplaces [77]. Various market mechanisms have been proposed [46, 57], but their effectiveness in deterring attacks is unclear [46, 52, 61]. Responsible vulnerability disclosure is incentivized by bug-hunting programs from providers like Google, Facebook, and Microsoft, or umbrella organizations that coordinate vulnerability reporting and disclosure [30, 63, 77]. However, it is unclear how these compare to the cybercrime economy, as key parameters such as exploit pricing in the underground are unknown. Additionally, the impact of vulnerability disclosure mechanisms on the risk of attack in the wild remains uncertain [61]. This study fills this gap by providing an empirical analysis of exploit pricing in the underground and evaluating the effect of cybercrime market factors on the actual occurrence of attacks.

## 3 Methodology

### 3.1 Market Infiltration and Evaluation

RuMarket is a forum-based market accessible via the open internet. Access requires explicit admission by market administrators, who perform background checks on requesters. Admission criteria include demonstrating control over identities in affiliated Russian hacking forums and active participation in the community. Gaining access to RuMarket required approximately six months to build a credible profile, identify affiliated markets, and establish a reputation within the hacking community. These activities required proficiency in Russian. Ethical considerations are discussed in Section 3.6. As market members, we had access to all product information, trades, and prices available to active participants. Our analysis covers seven years of market activity (July 2010 – April 2017).

#### Criteria for Market Evaluation

To ensure the credibility of the selected market, we evaluated several criteria based on the literature on the poor implementation of cybercrime markets [37, 75]. In previous work [8], we analyzed the market's economic mechanisms, traded goods, and participation. Here, we summarize the key criteria:

1. **Enforcement of Market Regulation Mechanisms:** Effective market rules, such as punishment for rippers and the presence of trade guarantors or escrows, are crucial for addressing foundational problems that hinder market sustainability [6, 28, 32, 37, 75]. In RuMarket, rippers are systematically punished, most sellers use market escrow services, and high entry costs deter unfair behavior.

2. **Evidence of Trade:** We evaluated the actual trading activity in the market, considering feedback from market participants, discussions, product evolution, and types of market interactions. All evidence points to effective trade mechanisms that foster trading activity.

3. **Presence of Prominent Attack Tools:** RuMarket's relevance is supported by the presence of traders for the most prominent attacks reported by the industry, including exploit kits like Blackhole, RIG, and Eleonore [3, 70], and malware like Zeus and Citadel [17, 19, 60].

### 3.2 Sampling Exploits in the Underground

The unstructured nature of forum-based markets necessitates careful consideration of data sampling. Unlike other criminal goods, the disclosure of too much information about an exploit can diminish its value, while revealing too little can lead to market death [37]. To meaningfully sample data, we identified the exploit reporting criteria used by vendors.

We randomly sampled 50 posts from RuMarket referring to “эксплоит” (‘exploit’) and slang variants, evaluating the type of reporting and market response. Our sample included 19 ads selling 35 exploits. Four reporting mechanisms emerged: using the standard Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) identifier, describing an exploit as affecting a disclosed vulnerability (Knwn), describing it as a zero-day, or not describing it at all (Und.). Table 1 summarizes the results.

| Type | Ads | Vulns | Tot. Avg. | Replies | Tot. Avg. | Trade Evidence |
|------|-----|-------|-----------|---------|-----------|----------------|
| CVE  | 9   | 30    | 3.3       | 57.5    | 518       | 55%            |
| Knwn | 4   | 4     | 1         | 13.8    | 55        | 50%            |
| 0day | 1   | 1     | 1         | 1       | 13        | 0%             |
| Und. | 5   | -     | -         | 65      | 13        | 25%            |

Posts reporting CVEs trade significantly more vulnerabilities and show greater market activity, measured by received replies, than other posts. Poorly described vulnerabilities are unlikely to show any evidence of trade, while CVE and Knwn vulnerabilities display similar rates. CVE-reported vulnerabilities represent the majority of traded vulnerabilities and receive significantly more attention from the RuMarket community.

Further supporting the relevance of CVE reporting, we found that market participants actively seek CVE information when it is not immediately available. This mechanism allows buyers to assess the exploit and verify the vendor's claims, addressing the problem of adverse selection [37]. For these reasons, we use CVE-IDs as a sampling mechanism for traded exploits, allowing us to measure additional characteristics of the vulnerability, including date of disclosure, technical severity, affected software, and presence in the wild.
