ABSTRACT
Cybercrime markets support the development and diffusion of new
attack technologies, vulnerability exploits, and malware. Whereas
the revenue streams of cyber attackers have been studied multi-
ple times in the literature, no quantitative account currently exists
on the economics of attack acquisition and deployment. Yet, this
understanding is critical to characterize the production of (traded)
exploits, the economy that drives it, and its effects on the overall
attack scenario. In this paper we provide an empirical investiga-
tion of the economics of vulnerability exploitation, and the effects
of market factors on likelihood of exploit. Our data is collected
first-handedly from a prominent Russian cybercrime market where
the trading of the most active attack tools reported by the security
industry happens. Our findings reveal that exploits in the under-
ground are priced similarly or above vulnerabilities in legitimate
bug-hunting programs, and that the refresh cycle of exploits is
slower than currently often assumed. On the other hand, cyber-
criminals are becoming faster at introducing selected vulnerabili-
ties, and the market is in clear expansion both in terms of players,
traded exploits, and exploit pricing. We then evaluate the effects
of these market variables on likelihood of attack realization, and
find strong evidence of the correlation between market activity
and exploit deployment. We discuss implications on vulnerability
metrics, economics, and exploit measurement.

1 INTRODUCTION
The rapid expansion of the cyber-threat scenario reported in the
recent literature is fostered by the presence of an ‘underground’
economy that supports the development, deployment, and moneti-
zation of cyber-attacks [35, 36]. A few studies analyze the dynamics

of the underground and the markets that drive it [8, 36, 37], focus-
ing on either the economic mechanisms that enable the market
activity [8, 37], or the ‘after the fact’ analysis of its effects in the
real world [15, 36]. However, it remains impossible to fully char-
acterize the underground production of cyber-attacks without a
quantitative account of its economic aspects. For example, several
allegations currently exist on the costs of an exploit in the under-
ground markets. Similarly, the ‘economy of malware’ is thought
to have significant repercussions on the realization of real-world
attacks, yet no scientific account of this relation is currently present
in the literature. Likewise, legitimate vulnerability markets [63, 77]
have been designed to ‘compete’ with cybercrime markets, but the
two systems remain hardly comparable without a more precise
account of their economic aspects. In this paper we fill this gap
by focusing on the economic aspects of exploit acquisition and
deployment, hence providing an additional piece in the otherwise
incomplete cybercrime puzzle.
Part of the reason why such analyses are scarce in the litera-
ture is the difficulty of identifying and studying ‘good’ or ‘influ-
ential’ underground markets. Criminal markets are known to be
fraught with economic problems that hinder fair trade, and conse-
quently market development [37, 69]. Moreover, markets trading
attack technologies tend to be strongly segregated [8, 68, 69, 75],
making their access and study more difficult to accomplish. For
example, common segregation mechanisms include the implemen-
tation of pull-in mechanisms, language barriers (especially Rus-
sian/Portugese/Chinese), and ingress monitoring [8]. On the other
hand, non-English speaking attackers reportedly generate a signifi-
cant fraction of attacks [43, 78]; this may be partly due to the still
loose international regulation of the cyber-space [44], as well as
economic and social aspects on welfare and higher education in
developing countries [25, 49, 50]. For example, Russian cybercrimi-
nals are known to produce malware that does not attack ex-Soviet
nations (ex-CIS), in an attempt to not catch the attention of the local
authorities. On the other hand, a significant fraction of the malware
detected at scale, as well as attack vectors such as exploit kits and
booter services [35, 42, 48] are suspected to have been engineered
by Russian attackers [43, 48, 70].
In this paper we characterize the economic aspects of vulnera-
bility exploits as traded in a prominent Russian cybercrime market
(RuMarket1) for user infections at scale (as opposed to targeted
or 0-day attacks), and of their effect on risk of exploit in the wild.
Through market infiltration we collect information on trade of
vulnerability exploits spanning from 2010 to 2017, and correlate
this data with Symantec data on exploits detected at scale. Our
contribution can be summarized as follows:
1We do not disclose the real name of the market to minimize threats to our anonymity.
(1) The time between vulnerability disclosure and appearance
of exploit in RuMarket is shortening, showing that attackers
are becoming more reactive in delivering selected exploits.
At the same time, number of actors and of traded exploits
is increasing; exploit prices are inflating, and exploit-as-a-
service models appear to allow for drastic cuts in exploitation
costs. This is particularly relevant for the development of
economic models of the underground, and impacts attacker
and risk modeling.
(2) We find strong evidence of the relation between market ac-
tivity and likelihood of exploitation in the wild. We find that
exploits that spawn higher levels of discussion in RuMarket
are associated with higher odds of exploitation in the wild,
and that high market prices hinder exploit deployment at
scale. This provides a quantitative link between attacker eco-
nomics and attack realization, and can directly contribute in
the development of (more) realistic attacker models.
(3) Exploit prices in the underground markets are aligned with
or above those of analogous ‘legitimate’ markets for vulner-
abilities and vary between 150 and 8000 USD, whereas the
arrival of new exploits is significantly slower than otherwise
often assumed. This provides insights on the incentives to
participate in the underground economy, and on the dynam-
ics of exploit introduction.
Scope of work. The goal of this paper is to provide insights on
exploit economics by analyzing one prominent Russian cybercrime
market; this work does not aim at providing a full enumeration
of all exploits traded in the underground: other cybercrime mar-
kets may feature different sets of exploits and/or foster different
cybercriminal activities, as well as enforcing different market reg-
ulation mechanisms. Similarly, RuMarket does not focus on 0day
exploits, whose employment for attacks at scale is reportedly very
limited [18], and are outside of the scope of this work.
This paper proceeds as follows. The following section discusses
related work. Methodology, data collection, and analysis proce-
dure are discussed in Section 3. Section 4 reports our analysis, and
Section 5 discusses our results.
2 RELATED WORK
The economics and development of underground markets have
perhaps been first tackled by Franklin et al. [33]. On the other hand,
Herley et al. [37] showed that cybercrime economics are distinc-
tively problematic in that the lack of effective rule enforcement
mechanisms may hinder fair trading, and as a consequence the
existence of the market itself. A few studies analyzed the evolution
of cybercrime markets [8, 23, 35, 53, 68, 75], and provided estimates
of malware development [22] and attack likelihood [11], but no
quantitative account of economic factors such as exploit pricing
and adoption are currently reported in the literature [22, 63]. In
this paper we provide the first empirical quantification of these
economic aspects by analyzing data collected first-handedly from a
prominent cybercrime market.
Recent work studied the services and monetization schemes of
cyber criminals, e.g. to launder money through acquisition of expen-
sive goods [36], or renting infected systems [35, 42]. The provision
of the technological means by which these attacks are perpetrated
remain however relatively unexplored [63], with the exception of a
few technical insights from industrial reports [43, 70]. Similarly, a
few studies estimated the economic effects of cybercrime activities
on the real-world economy, for example by analyzing the mone-
tization of stolen credit cards and banking information [15], the
realization of profits from spam campaigns [45], the registration
of fake online accounts [71], and the provision of booter services
for distributed denial of service attacks [47]. However, a characteri-
zation of the costs of the technology (as opposed to the earnings
it generates), and the relation of trade factors on the realization of
an attack is still missing. This work provides a first insight on the
value of vulnerability exploits in the underground markets, and the
effects of market factors on presence of attacks in the wild.
The presence of a cybcercrime economy that absorbs vulnera-
bilities and generates attacks motivated the security community
to study the devision of ‘legitimate’ vulnerability markets that at-
tract security researchers away from the illegal marketplaces [77].
Whereas several market mechanisms have been proposed [46, 57],
their effectiveness in deterring attacks is not clear [46, 52, 61]. The
so-called responsible vulnerability disclosure is incentivized by the
presence of multiple bug-hunting programs by several providers
such as Google, Facebook, and Microsoft, or ‘umbrella’ organiza-
tions that coordinate vulnerability reporting and disclosure [30,
63, 77]. It is however unclear how do these compare against the
cybercrime economy, as several key parameters such as exploit
pricing in the underground are currently unknown. Further, it re-
mains uncertain whether the adoption of vulnerability disclosure
mechanisms has a clear effect on risk of attack in the wild [61]. This
study fills this gap by providing an empirical analysis of exploit
pricing in the underground, and evaluating the effect of cybercrime
market factors on the actual realization of attacks in the wild.
3 METHODOLOGY
Sections 3.1 to 3.3 present our methodology and provide a detailed
description of our data. In Sec. 3.4 we outline the analysis procedure,
assumptions, and data handling. Sec. 3.5 discusses observational
biases of this study, and Sec. 3.6 addresses ethical aspects.
3.1 Market infiltration and evaluation
RuMarket is a forum-based market that can be reached from the
open Internet. Access to the market requires explicit admission
by the market administrators, who validate the access request by
performing background checks on the requester. The main criterion
for admission is the ability to demonstrate that the requester has
control over other identities in affiliated Russian hacking forums,
and that he/she has been active in the community.2 Gaining access
to RuMarket required approximately six months to build a cred-
ible profile, identify affiliated markets, and letting our alter-ego
gain reputation within the hacking community. These activities
required some level of proficiency in Russian. Section 3.6 provides
a discussion on ethical aspects. As members of the market, we have
access to all the (history of) product information, trades, and prices
2Admission criteria were initially enforced upon the 2013 arrest, performed by the
Russian authorities, of a prominent market member. The enforcement of the admission
criteria, albeit still present at the time of writing, has now loosened up.
available to active participants. This analysis spans seven years of
market activity (July 2010 - April 2017).
Criteria for market evaluation. It is important to first evaluate
whether the selected market is a credible candidate for analysis,
or is yet another example of many ‘scam-for-scammers’ under-
ground forums [33, 37]. Following indications in the literature on
the poor implementation of cybercrime markets [37, 75], in previ-
ous work [8] we performed an analysis of the markets’ economic
mechanisms (e.g. addressing information asymmetry [6], adverse
selection, and moral hazard [28, 37]), traded goods, and partici-
pation. We here provide a summary of the considered criteria. A
complete account of these aspects is given in [8].
Cr.1 Enforcement of market regulation mechanisms; market mech-
anisms enforcing market rules, such as punishment for rippers or
presence of trade guarantors or escrows are known to be central
to address foundational problems that cripple the economics of cy-
bercrime markets [6, 28, 32, 37, 75] and hinder product quality. We
found that in RuMarket, rippers are systematically punished, most
sellers use the market escrow services to guarantee transactions,
and that the high costs of market entry hinder unfair behavior.
Cr.2 Evidence of trade. We evaluated face evidence of actual trad-
ing activity in the market. Accounting for indications from eco-
nomic literature [62, 67], we investigate trade-related feedback from
market participants, discussions in the market threads, product evo-
lution, and type of market interactions; all evidence points toward
effective trade mechanisms that foster trading activity.
Cr.3 Presence of prominent attack tools reported by the industry.
The relevance of RuMarket in the threat scenario is supported by
the presence of traders for the most prominent attacks reported by
the industry. Among those, we find several exploit kits [35] (e.g.
Blackhole, RIG, Eleonore [3, 70]) and malware that led numerous
infection campaigns (e.g. Zeus, Citadel [17, 19, 60]).
3.2 Sampling exploits in the underground
The unstructured nature of forum-based markets calls for a few
additional considerations on data sampling: whereas most (crimi-
nal) goods such as drugs, weapons, and illegal pornography can be
easily identified and described or demoed by vendors (and there-
fore measured by investigators [69]), the disclosure of too much
information on an exploit would destroy its value [52], whereas
revealing too little eventually leads to market death (as buyers can-
not assess what they buy) [37]. In order to meaningfully sample
data points, it is therefore critical to identify the exploit reporting
criteria adopted by vendors.
To this aim, we randomly sample 50 posts from RuMarket gener-
ally referring to “эксплоит” (‘exploit’) and (slang) variants thereof,
and evaluate the type of reporting and received market response
(i.e. number of replies, and trade evidence [69]). In our sample we
find 19 ads selling 35 exploits overall. Four reporting mechanisms
emerge: using the standard Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
(CVE) identifier [2]; describing an exploit as affecting a disclosed
vulnerability (Knwn); describing it as a 0day; not describing it at all
(Und.). Table 1 summarizes the results. Overall, we find nine adverts
reporting 30 CVEs, one reporting a single 0day, and four reporting
one Knwn vulnerability each. Five additional posts (Und.) advert an

undefined number of vulnerabilities without further details on af-
fected software or type of exploit. The first observation is that posts
reporting CVEs trade on average significantly more vulnerabilities
than other posts (p = 0.03 for a Wilcoxon rank sum test), indicating
that this category likely represents the great majority of marketed
exploits. Adverts reporting CVEs also show greater market activ-
ity, measured in terms of received replies (p = 0.05), than other
posts. Similarly, poorly described vulnerabilities are unlikely to
show any evidence of trade, whereas CVE and Knwn vulnerabilities
display similar rates. Overall, we find that vulnerabilities reported
by CVE represent the significant majority of traded vulnerabilities
(by almost an order of magnitude), and receive significantly more
attention from the RuMarket community than the aggregate.
Further supporting the relevance of CVE reporting, we find that
market participants actively look for CVE information when not
immediately available; for example, an interested buyer of the KTR
package asks (translated from Russian): “Which exploits are bundled
in the pack at the moment? If possible, specify the CVE”; the seller
complies. Numerous other examples go in this same direction. Crit-
ically, this mechanism allows buyers to perform a first assessment
of the exploit, and to verify that the characteristics of the vulnera-
bility it exploits match the vendor’s claims (e.g. allow for remote
code execution or privilege escalation); this, alongside other market
mechanisms described in previous work [8], directly addresses the
problem of adverse selection, foundational to all markets of this
type, and first underlined in [37]. Indeed, vulnerability identifica-
tion is part of the regulation of the market itself: for example, a
vendor was blocked by the forum administrators when trying to
sell (for 3000 USD) an identifiable Windows PoC (CVE-2012-0002);
the admin explains: “This [exploit] is public (if not today, tomorrow).
The DOS proof-of-concept is already public. Such sales are prohibited”.
For these reasons in this study we use CVE-IDs as a sampling
mechanism for traded exploits. This has also the advantage of al-
lowing us to precisely measure additional characteristics of the
vulnerability, including date of disclosure, technical severity, af-
fected software, and presence in the wild, all of which would be
impossible without a rigorous definition of published exploits. Im-
portantly, this also rules out errors caused by double counting
vulnerabilities, while accounting for the vast majority of published
exploits (ref. Tab 1). The remaining bias is discussed in Sec. 3.5.
3.3 Data collection
In this analysis we employ three datasets. The collected data fields
are reported in Table 2; in the Appendix we report an extended
description of each field.
Table 2: Summary of collected variables used in the analysis
Description and summary statistics of the collected data fields. Unit indicates the type of data field. Lvls indicates, for categorical variables, the number of factor levels.
Descriptive statistics are provided for cardinal/ordinal variables, and categorical variables with only two factors (encoded as 1: presence of condition; 0: absence of condition).
From the product descriptions naturally emerge the following package categorization (vulnerability descriptions from NVD [2]):
a) STANDALONE: packages traded as stand-alone exploits that are then personalized by the buyer. For example, CVE-2016-0189 “allow[s] remote attackers to execute arbitrary
code [..] via a crafted web site”, and is traded in RuMarket as a STANDALONE exploit to which the customer can add his/her own ‘private’ (sic.) shellcode.
b) MALWARE: exploits embedded in malware packaging services. Exploits in these packages typically allow for privilege escalation. For example, CVE-2015-1701 “allows
local users to gain privileges via a crafted application”, and in RuMarket is bundled in a MALWARE dropper that, when executed on the target machine, escalates to higher
privileges and executes the custom code.
c) EKIT: exploit packages typically rented (as opposed to traded) as exploit kits, namely web servers that deliver exploits and custom payloads to victims that are redirected
to the kit [48]. The rental period in our sample goes from a week to a month. EKITs operation requires the execution of arbitrary code on the victim system to remotely
drop the malware. For example, CVE-2016-1019 “allows remote attackers to [..] execute arbitrary code”, and in RuMarket it is embedded in the notorious exploit kit RIG.
