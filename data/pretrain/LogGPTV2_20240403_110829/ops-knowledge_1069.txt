User: I am writing a python program that lauches a subprocess (using Popen).
I am reading stdout of the subprocess, doing some filtering, and writing to
stdout of main process.
When I kill the main process (cntl-C) the subprocess keeps running.
How do I kill the subprocess too? The subprocess is likey to run a long time.
Context:
I'm launching only one subprocess at a time, I'm filtering its stdout.
The user might decide to interrupt to try something else.
I'm new to python and I'm using windows, so please be gentle.
Assistant: subprocess.Popen objects come with a kill and a terminate method (differs in which signal you send to the process).
signal.signal allows you install signal handlers, in which you can call the child's kill method.
