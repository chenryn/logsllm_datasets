ABSTRACT
We propose STRIDE, a new DDoS-resilient Internet ar-
chitecture that isolates attack traﬃc through viable band-
width allocation, preventing a botnet from crowding out
legitimate ﬂows. This new architecture presents several
novel concepts including tree-based bandwidth allocation
and long-term static paths with guaranteed bandwidth. In
concert, these mechanisms provide domain-based bandwidth
guarantees within a trust domain – administrative domains
grouped within a legal jurisdiction with enforceable account-
ability; each administrative domain in the trust domain can
then internally split such guarantees among its endhosts to
provide (1) connection establishment with high probability,
and (2) precise bandwidth guarantees for established ﬂows,
regardless of the size or distribution of the botnet outside
the source and the destination domains. Moreover, STRIDE
maintains no per-ﬂow state on backbone routers and re-
quires no key establishment across administrative domains.
We demonstrate that STRIDE achieves these DDoS defense
properties through formal analysis and simulation. We also
show that STRIDE mitigates emerging DDoS threats such
as Denial-of-Capability (DoC) [6] and N 2 attacks [22] based
on these properties that none of the existing DDoS defense
mechanisms can achieve.

DDoS attacks are still prevalent in the Internet today.

that Botnet-driven DDoS attacks have become common as
a low cost, high-proﬁle form of cyber-protest. Both attack

intensity and frequency have drastically accelerated:
the
largest reported attack size doubled every year, to more than
100 Gbps seen in 2010. The majority of network operators in
the survey also ranked DDoS attacks as the biggest threat.
The recently proposed N 2 attack [22], also referred to as
a Coremelt attack, poses a new threat and has not been ef-
fectively addressed by any system to date. In an N 2 attack,
an adversary uses a large-scale botnet whose bots communi-
cate only with each other to overload network links. Current
DDoS defense mechanisms that attempt to eliminate unde-
sired traﬃc are rendered ineﬀective, because all inter-bot
traﬃc is desired by the bot endhosts. Other DDoS defense
mechanisms that perform per-source or per-computation fair
sharing at congested links may in fact give disproportionate
advantage to sources with small uplink bandwidth or with
high computational resources, respectively. Moreover, mali-
cious domains can misuse per-source fair sharing by creating
multiple bogus senders, and per-computation fair sharing
may be too expensive to protect every data packet. Fur-
thermore, global fair sharing implies global fate sharing –
a source’s share is aﬀected by bots in distant domains over
which the source has no inﬂuence.
Current DDoS countermeasures have encountered funda-
mental limitations to address the challenges we describe
above to be compatible with the current Internet. Thus, an
exciting research challenge is to study if a next-generation
network infrastructure could be more eﬀective against DDoS
attacks – what architectural primitives can eﬀectively defend
against DDoS attacks?
In this paper, we formulate a new network architecture
called STRIDE that provides domain-based guarantees for
intrinsic DDoS protection within a Trust Domain (TD),
which contains a set of contiguous Autonomous Domains
(AD) with a common root of trust. Speciﬁcally, STRIDE
provides precise bandwidth guarantees to AD-level paths, or
the “sanctuary trails” that isolate attack traﬃc from legiti-
mate communication. Each endpoint AD can then internally
split the guarantee among its endhosts.
Our architecture is based on the following insights:
(1) Bandwidth allocation is simple in a tree-based topol-
ogy, as the available bandwidth can be split from the root
down to each leaf; (2) with network capabilities encoded
in packet-carried state and ﬁxed bandwidth classes, routers
can perform enforcement in a per-ﬂow stateless fashion using
probabilistic detection of the largest ﬂows; (3) by combin-
ing a static long-term traﬃc class guaranteeing low band-
width with a dynamically-allocated short-term traﬃc class
guaranteeing high bandwidth, we can provide a variety of

guarantees to both privately communicating endhosts and
public servers.
We leverage the SCION next-generation Internet archi-
tecture [31] to perform the tree-based bandwidth allocation:
paths are created and available bandwidth is allocated as
paths branch out like trees from the network core. The
packet-carried forwarding state of SCION also provides us
with a natural way to encode network capabilities [4, 26].
Note that existing schemes for bandwidth reservation
(e.g., RSVP [8]) or Quality of Service are insuﬃcient to
guarantee timely end-to-end data delivery in the presence
of DDoS adversaries for several reasons: (1) their reserva-
tion requests are unprotected against DDoS attacks, and
(2) they lack lower-bound guarantees for reservable band-
width. In contrast, STRIDE provides domain-based guaran-
tees, achieving previously unachievable DDoS defense prop-
erties for communication within a TD; many of the proper-
ties also translate for communication between TDs.
STRIDE provably guarantees connection setup for private
communication, bounds the waiting time for accessing pub-
lic services, and provides precise bandwidth guarantees for
established ﬂows, all achieved regardless of the size or dis-
tribution of the botnet outside the source and destination
ADs. These guarantees enable STRIDE to mitigate emerg-
ing threats such as the Denial-of-Capability (DoC) and N 2
attacks. Furthermore, STRIDE does not require backbone
routers to keep per-ﬂow state.
2. BACKGROUND: SCION
In this section, we review the SCION network archi-
tecture [31] that STRIDE leverages for DDoS resilience.
Among new Internet architecture proposals [27,31], we base
our design on SCION because its notion of Trust Domain
(TD) and secure top-down topology discovery enable tree-
based bandwidth allocation within a uniform legal environ-
ment, whereby bandwidth guarantees and attack isolation
can be enforced. Note that although SCION enables nat-
ural isolation of attack traﬃc from untrusted entities, it is
still vulnerable to DDoS threats within a TD; in contrast,
STRIDE seeks to provide domain-based bandwidth guaran-
tees for intra-TD communication.
We consider an Internet topology at the Autonomous Do-
main (AD) level.
In this topology, nodes represent ADs,
each of which has several gateway routers (or interfaces)
connecting it to neighboring ADs. Endpoint ADs provide
Internet access to endhosts.
SCION divides ADs on the Internet into several trust
domains (TDs), where a TD is deﬁned as “a set of ADs
that agree on a coherent root of trust and have mutual ac-
countability and enforceability for route computation under
a common regulatory framework” [31]. Each TD contains a
TD Core (TDC) consisting of the tier-1 ISPs that manage
the TD. The primary advantage of such a trust domain di-
vision is that it avoids having a single root of trust for the
entire Internet, which is diﬃcult to unanimously agree on in
practice. For ease of presentation, we will focus on opera-
tions within one TD unless we mention otherwise explicitly.
Figure 1 illustrates these concepts.
2.2 Secure Top-Down Topology Discovery
For ﬁnding routing paths in SCION, the TDC periodi-
cally broadcasts Path Construction Beacons (PCB), which
establish half-paths back to the TDC as they are dissemi-
nated throughout the network in a top-down manner (i.e.,
from the TDC to endpoint ADs). End-to-end communica-
tion paths are established by combining the source’s and
destination’s half-paths.
PCBs are constructed as follows. The TDC initiates PCBs
which contain one-hop paths starting from the core to its ad-
jacent customer ADs with their expiration times. Upon re-
ceiving a PCB, an intermediate AD updates the PCB for
each of its downstream ADs (e.g., customers and peers)
with the authenticated local topology: the ith intermediate
AD (ADi) appends to the PCB the local path information,
ingress and egress interfaces Ii, for a particular downstream
AD (ADi+1) followed by an opaque ﬁeld Oi, which encodes
the forwarding decision as ingress/egress points at ADi.
Ii = ingressikegressikADi+1,
Oi = MACKi(IikOi−1),
(1)
where ingressi and egressi stand for the ingress and egress
interfaces of ADi. Oi is computed using a secret key Ki
known only to ADi to protect the integrity of the routing
information. Also, ADi digitally signs PCBs to prevent fake
route injection. Note that PCBs in SCION do not announce
bandwidth availability.
ADi propagates the updated PCB to the designated
downstream AD (ADi+1). ADi repeats this process for
other downstream ADs on diﬀerent paths, and upon receiv-
ing PCBs, the downstream ADs learn the path to reach the
TDC. PCBs travel along a special control channel which
has isolated bandwidth from all data packets and hence is
protected from data-plane DDoS attacks.
For each received PCB, an endpoint AD learns a series
of interfaces and opaque ﬁelds as an unforgeable path token
that represents the forwarding decisions of the correspond-
ing path. To send packets on the path, the sender embeds
in the packet header the path token, which reminds every
intermediate AD of its own routing decision for carrying the
packet based on its policy. Hence, no forwarding state at
routers is needed.
Among all the half-paths that an endpoint AD learns from
PCBs, the endpoint AD selects some as up-paths for reach-
ing the TDC and some as down-paths for receiving packets
from the TDC. To form end-to-end paths, the destination
AD publishes its down-paths (i.e., the path tokens of these
416down-paths) to the Path Server, which is a DNS-like sys-
tem, in the TDC. A source AD wishing to communicate with
the destination can query the Path Server for the destina-
tion’s down-paths. An end-to-end path is then constructed
by splicing the source’s and destination’s half-paths.
3. THREAT MODEL
We consider massive Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)
attacks launched by a botnet, which consists of a large num-
ber of malware-infected bot endhost machines. In particular,
we address two types of DDoS attacks: (1) disabling connec-
tion setup in capability-based protocols (DoC attack [6]),
and (2) exhausting link bandwidth to crowd out established
legitimate connections.
In bandwidth exhaustion attacks,
we especially focus on the N 2 attack [22], which aims to
overload a target ISP’s backbone network using a large num-
ber of legitimate-looking ﬂows established among colluding
bots (hence, any attempt to identify the attack based on
the ﬂow’s bandwidth would fail). This attack is called an
N 2 attack, because the N bots can open O(N 2) connections
among each other.
3.1 Desired Properties
We aim to achieve the following properties for a DDoS-
resilient network architecture.
Domain-based guarantees within a TD. Precise band-
width guarantees should be provided to communication be-
tween endpoint domains residing in the same TD, and each
endpoint domain can internally split the guarantee among
its endhosts based on its local policy. A domain that in-
tends to achieve highly available communication could iden-
tify malicious bots and remove them to provide better guar-
antees to legitimate endhosts. Domain-based guarantees en-
sure that the eﬀect of attacks is conﬁned to infested do-
mains, such that the endhosts can establish a bandwidth-
guaranteed ﬂow with high probability.
Robustness and eﬃciency. To be resilient to DDoS at-
tacks, network elements require eﬃcient protocols and net-
work devices.
indicates that the architecture should avoid
per-ﬂow or per-host state at backbone routers and should
avoid expensive operations such as digital signature genera-
tion or veriﬁcation in the fastpath.1
Flexible route control. Endpoint ADs should be able
to control paths to avoid congestion: a source AD needs
to have multiple paths to reach a destination; a destination
AD should be able to hide/disclose paths for private/public
communication, and change inbound paths to shift traﬃc.
3.2 Assumptions
In designing a new DDoS resilient Internet architecture,
we only make two fundamental assumptions that can be
justiﬁed using existing security mechanisms.
TDCs support congestion-free communication. Since
the TDC topology is small and relatively ﬁxed, ADs in the
TDC can accurately assess and provision the capacity re-
quirement of each link to ensure no packet loss for traﬃc
below a certain rate. For example, given a topology and

Fastpath and slowpath refer to diﬀerent processing elements that
handle packet forwarding in a router. The fastpath refers to packet
processing by dedicated hardware, for example, by the linecard in a
router. The slowpath refers to packet processing by a general CPU,
which often results in a packet processing latency that is usually about
two orders of magnitude slower than the fastpath.

its link capacity, the TDC can adopt congestion-free rout-
ing [30] to determine how much congestion-free traﬃc it can
support on each incoming link.
TDC detects and revokes malicious AD members.
Since all ADs of a TD are within a uniform legal environment
(as described in Section 2), the TDC can revoke the member-
ship of misbehaving ADs. In Section 8, we discuss technical
approaches to detect compromised or poorly-administered
ADs that fail to correctly monitor traﬃc.
4. STRIDE: DESIGN OVERVIEW
We ﬁrst sketch how our new architecture, STRIDE, pro-
vides guaranteed end-to-end data delivery to legitimate ﬂows
even in the presence of DDoS attacks.
In a nutshell,
STRIDE protects end-to-end data delivery by establishing
communication channels 2 that conﬁne the eﬀect of attacks
to their originating domains, leaving other domains unaf-
fected. Such communication channels also form the “sanctu-
ary trails” that isolate attack traﬃc from legitimate commu-
nication. Moreover, since bots within a domain will compete
among each other for a ﬁxed amount of bandwidth, band-
width guarantees can be provided to channels regardless of
the size or distribution of the botnet outside the source and
destination domains.
Hence, the primary challenge STRIDE faces are how to se-
cure such channel establishment and adjust allocation in re-
sponse to dynamic traﬃc patterns. STRIDE addresses these
challenges by combining (1) a low bandwidth but long-lived
and guaranteed traﬃc class for channel establishment with
(2) a high bandwidth but short-term dynamically-allocated
traﬃc class. Speciﬁcally, a channel is constructed using any
of the 3 types of bandwidth classes: static, dynamic, and best
eﬀort (BE). Hybrid channels are also possible, as we explain
