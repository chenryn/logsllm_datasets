Equation (2) means: given a priori distribution Pr [Xj = i],
we can use y, the number of sampled packets for a ﬂow,
to calculate the probability with which the ﬂow has more
than x packets in the population. Let a ﬂow j be an ele-
phant ﬂow if the number of unsampled packets Xj ≥ ˆx;
i.e., ˆx is the threshold identifying an elephant ﬂow (e.g.,
ˆx = 104 for the example in the previous section). Then, if
Pr [Xj ≥ ˆx|Yj ≥ ˆy] is close enough to 1 for a given y = ˆy, the
ﬂow j is very likely to have more than ˆx packets in the pop-
ulation. In other words, if the number of sampled packets
Yj for a ﬂow j is greater than ˆy, there is a high probability
that the ﬂow represented by the sampled packets is indeed
an elephant ﬂow in unsampled packets.
Intuitively, Pr [Xj ≥ ˆx|Yj ≥ ˆy] will increase with ˆy. How-
ever, there is an intrinsic trade-oﬀ between false positives
and false negatives, which prevents us from choosing an ar-
bitrary ˆy. Our framework allows us to quantify this trade-oﬀ
and make proper choices, as we shall see shortly.
4.2 Trade-off between false probabilities
If we assume that a ﬂow for which Yj satisﬁes Yj ≥ y(cid:1)
is an elephant ﬂow, then the false positive ratio (FPR) and
the false negative rate (FNR) can be deﬁned as follows.

These equations can be calculated by using (2). Ideally,
we should ﬁnd y(cid:1)
= ˆy such that both FPR(ˆy) and FNR(ˆy)
are minimized. However, as shown below, there is a trade-oﬀ
between the two metrics. The trade-oﬀ becomes particularly
critical when the sampling frequency f is very low. Again,
we illustrate this trade-oﬀ by using the IPCL trace.
Figure 2 shows FPR(y(cid:1)
= 1, 2, ...) calcu-
lated by using (3) and (4). Here, the number of unsampled
packets is N = 107, and the threshold to identify an ele-
−3 and
phant ﬂow is ˆx = 104. Sampling frequency f is 10
−4, respectively. For Pr [Xj = i], we used the one from
10
the IPCL trace, i.e., the distribution shown in Fig. 1.
In
leads to a decrease in FPR(y(cid:1)
both cases, an increase in y(cid:1)
)
and an increase in FNR(y(cid:1)
); i.e., there is an unavoidable
trade-oﬀ between the two metrics. We can also see that the
trade-oﬀ is more critical at the lower sampling frequency
(i.e., f = 10
−4).

4.3 Flow identiﬁcation procedure
According to the result shown in the previous subsection,
we have to make appropriate trade-oﬀs between false pos-
itives and false negatives when identifying elephant ﬂows.
This subsection presents such a ﬂow identiﬁcation procedure
designed with these observations kept in mind.
We consider the following policy as a guideline, i.e., the
false positive ratio should be reasonably low while reducing
the false negative rate for a given sampling frequency. Ac-
cording to this policy, we should keep the false positive ratio
low enough without sacriﬁcing the false negative rate too
much, which is the consequence of the trade-oﬀ. Neverthe-
less, identifying elephant ﬂows with a suﬃciently low false
positive ratio still provides very useful information for traf-
ﬁc engineering and network operation. First, we can avoid
mistreating non-elephant ﬂows (e.g., shaping their packet
rate) when the false positive ratio is suﬃciently low. Sec-
ond, although keeping a low false positive ratio may cause
a higher false negative rate, the amount of traﬃc generated
by the identiﬁed ﬂows is already signiﬁcant. For example, in
the IPCL trace, the 10 heaviest elephant ﬂows account for
about 10% of the total traﬃc volume.
According to the policy, our goal is to ﬁnd y(cid:1)
= ˆy such
that FPR(ˆy) becomes reasonably low. However, merely in-
creasing ˆy will lead to an increase in FNR(ˆy), due to the
revealed trade-oﬀ. So, we obtain the threshold ˆy with the
following constraint
ˆy = min
y(cid:1)
y(cid:1) | FPR(y(cid:1)
,

) ≤ 
where  speciﬁes a tolerable false positive ratio. Equation
(5) guarantees an FPR is lower than  (say, 0.05), while
keeping the corresponding FNR as low as possible.
When f = 10
Table 1 lists ˆy, FPR(ˆy), and FNR(ˆy) as calculated by
following (5) for the examples shown in Fig. 2. Here, we
−3, if ˆy, the number of sampled
have  = 0.05. When f = 10
packets for a ﬂow, is greater than 13, the ﬂow is very likely
to be an elephant ﬂow, since FPR(ˆy) ≤  = 0.05. Due to
the fact that FNR(ˆy) ≈ 0.25, about 25% of elephant ﬂows
in unsampled packets will be missed on average.
−4, FNR(ˆy) becomes much higher if ˆy = 4;
i.e., more elephant ﬂows in unsampled packets will be missed
due to an ultra-low sampling frequency and a bounded false
positive ratio. However, the identiﬁed elephant ﬂows are
more likely to be elephant ﬂows, which is also meaningful
for traﬃc engineering and network operation. The result
also suggests that for such a low f , it is advisable to allow a
higher tolerable FPR, or to have a higher f when aﬀordable,
if false negatives have greater impact on network operation
than false positives. Since the number of elephant ﬂows
in the IPCL trace is 167, we can expect that on average
about 38 (i.e., 167 × (1 − 0.774)) heavy elephant ﬂows will
be identiﬁed according to our approach.
In a summary, the procedure for identifying elephant ﬂows
in sampled packets is enumerated as follows.
Step 1: Determine (i) the number of packets N in the

population, (ii) a sampling frequency f , (iii) a threshold
ˆx determining an elephant ﬂow in unsampled packets, (iv)
an a priori distribution of Xj of unsampled packets (i.e.,
Pr [Xj = i]), and (v) a threshold  that FPR should satisfy.
Step 2: Calculate ˆy by using the above (i) – (v) and (5).
Step 3: Conduct periodic packet sampling, and mean-
while count the number of per-ﬂow packets.
Step 4: If the number of sampled packets for a ﬂow is
greater than ˆy, the ﬂow is identiﬁed as an elephant ﬂow.
4.4 Performance evaluation
−3, 10
In this subsection, we evaluate our approach through an
actual packet sampling process for the IPCL trace. Fol-
lowing the procedure described in the previous subsection,
we ﬁrst determine the following parameters (ref. Step 1):
−4}, and ˆx = 104. We again use the
N = 107, f ∈ {10
distribution of the IPCL trace shown in Fig. 1 as the a priori
distribution of Xj . Second, we use the calculated ˆy listed
in Table 1 (Step 2). We then conduct the actual packet
sampling for the IPCL trace and count the number of per-
ﬂow packets (Step 3). We use periodic sampling, which is
the simplest form to implement; i.e., we periodically sample
every (N/n)-th packet. Finally, we investigate the ﬂows for
which the sampled packets satisfy Yj ≥ ˆy (Step 4). The
number of identiﬁed elephant ﬂows in sampled packets is
denoted as ˆne. Among these ˆne ﬂows, there are ne actual
elephant ﬂows by our deﬁnition. We use Ne to denote the
number of total elephant ﬂows in unsampled packets (recall
that Ne = 167 for the IPCL trace, as stated in Section 4).
Here, the false positive ratio FPR and false negative rate
FNR can be approximated by FPR = 1 − ne/ˆne, FNR =
1 − ne/Ne.
FPR and FNR through packet sampling of the IPCL trace
are listed in Table 2. As we can see, they are in good agree-
ment with those listed in Table 1, which were calculated
from (3) and (4), respectively. This result conﬁrms that our
approach can eﬀectively identify elephant ﬂows in sampled
packets. With a periodic sampling, such an approach is also
very eﬃcient.
5. A PRIORI DISTRIBUTION OF Xj
Identifying elephant ﬂows accurately requires an appro-
priately chosen ˆy. We have shown that such a ˆy can be
obtained by following (5). To do so, we need know N , f ,
and ˆx, and Pr [Xj = i]; i.e., we have to obtain the distribu-
tion of Xj in unsampled packets. There are three possible
approaches: A) use the distribution measured previously at
the same link; B) infer the unsampled ﬂow statistics (e.g.,
per-ﬂow packet distribution) from sampled ﬂow statistics;
C) utilize the power-law characteristic of Internet traﬃc.
Approach A assumes that the distribution is similar if
measured at the same link in similar periods (say, in daily
busy hours). However, this approach lacks scalability, since
it requires the direct measurement of ﬂow characteristics.
Approach B uses the result given by Duﬃeld et al. [3]; i.e.,
with the estimated number of original ﬂows, the unsam-
