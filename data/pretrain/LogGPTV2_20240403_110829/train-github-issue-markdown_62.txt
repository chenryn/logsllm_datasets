#### Describe the workflow you want to enable
Current score_func for feature selection methods does not consider
multicollinearity between features.
#### Describe your proposed solution
Introduce mRMR (Minimum Redundancy and Maximum Relevance) score as score_func
for feature selection methods.
Variant of mRMR scores in a nutshell:
  * MID: Mutual Information to target - Mutual Information between features
  * MIQ: Mutual Information to target / Mutual Information between features
  * FCD: F Statistic to target - Correlation between features
  * FCQ: F Statistic to target / Correlation between features
From what I understand Mutual Information and F Statistic already implemented
as score_func in scikit-learn, so these mRmR scores are somewhat an extension
of it.
