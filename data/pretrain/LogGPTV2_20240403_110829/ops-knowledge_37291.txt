User: I have a main program, in which a user can call a sub-process (to download files) several times. Each time, I call aria2c using subprocess, and it will print the progress to stdin. Of course, it is desirable that the user can see the progress of each download seperately. 
So the question is how can I redirect the output of each process to a seperate console window?
Assistant: I'm a bit confused. Using subprocess.Popen(...) should spawn a new command prompt automatically for each call. What is aria2c? Is it a program you had written in python as well? Is it a 3rd party exe that writes to the command prompt window?
I can help you to redirect all the sub-processes output to the main command prompt, so it can be displayed inline.
Also, maybe you can give a little more detail on what is going on first, so I can understand your trouble a bit better.
