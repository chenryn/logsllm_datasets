#### Issue Description
Hello, the Video Challenges are not being marked as complete. I did the first
four or so of computer basics and nothing was checked. I exited the browser,
tried the first one two more times and it was still not marked as complete.
Then I tried the first one of JavaScript lingo, completed the quiz, but still
no green check mark.
