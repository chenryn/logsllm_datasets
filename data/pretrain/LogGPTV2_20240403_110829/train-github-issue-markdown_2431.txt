### Issue Description
I am experiencing an issue where the Video Challenges are not being marked as complete. Specifically, I completed the first four challenges in the "Computer Basics" section, but none of them were marked as complete. I tried exiting and re-entering the browser, and even attempted the first challenge multiple times, but it still did not register as complete.

Additionally, I completed the first challenge in the "JavaScript Lingo" section, including the quiz, but it also did not receive a green check mark to indicate completion.

### Browser Information
- **Browser:** Google Chrome (latest version)
- **Operating System:** OS X El Capitan

Thank you for your assistance.
