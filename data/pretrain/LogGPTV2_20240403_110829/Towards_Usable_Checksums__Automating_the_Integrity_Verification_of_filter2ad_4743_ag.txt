**Notes:**
- **A7**: The warning message was customized depending on the answer provided by the respondent to question A1.
- **A9**: The actual survey presented three distinct examples of popular websites to respondents. Respondents were asked whether they recalled seeing any similar “sequence of numbers and characters” in the past months from websites they visited.
- **A10**: The same screenshots of question A9 were also displayed for question A10. Respondents were presented a concrete scenario of downloading an app from a website with checksum and asked what they would do with the “sequence of letters and numbers”.
