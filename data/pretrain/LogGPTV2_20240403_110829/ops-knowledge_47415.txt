User: I already install OpenERP and PostgreSQL in google compute engine.
Using debian 7. when i check with ifconfig as root user. I just got 2 ip addres.
127.0.0.1 and my internal ip address. My external IP/IP Public can't detected by debian 7.
I use ephemeral ip address for my external IP.
I allready try run OpenERP service using 127.0.0.1:8069 and my internal IP 10.240.226.xxx.
I can't access it from my external IP 8.34.xxx.xx:8069.
Please give me advice to fix these problem? and where i can contact or find Google "Help & Support" or submit "ticket support", beside using stackoverflow and google group?
Assistant: you could limit access to your OpenERP instance by specifying --allowed_ip_sources="x.x.x.x" the IP or the CIDR range from where you expect the application to be accessed. 
Additionally limit access of 8060 port only to your OpenERP instance, by tagging the instance as say ERP and apply --target_tags="ERP" to limit traffic from your source IP range to hit only the specific ERP instance.
