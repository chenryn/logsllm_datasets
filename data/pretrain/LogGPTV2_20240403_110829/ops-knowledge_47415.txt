I understand that you have installed OpenERP and PostgreSQL on a Google Compute Engine (GCE) instance running Debian 7. You can only see the loopback IP (127.0.0.1) and the internal IP address, but not the external IP address. You are using an ephemeral IP address for your external IP. Despite trying to run the OpenERP service using both 127.0.0.1:8069 and your internal IP (10.240.226.xxx), you cannot access it from your external IP (8.34.xxx.xx:8069).

### Steps to Resolve the Issue:

1. **Check Firewall Rules:**
   - Ensure that the GCE firewall rules allow traffic on port 8069.
   - You can check and modify firewall rules in the GCE console under the "VPC network" section.

2. **Configure OpenERP to Listen on All Interfaces:**
   - By default, OpenERP might be configured to listen only on the loopback interface (127.0.0.1). You need to configure it to listen on all interfaces (0.0.0.0).
   - Edit the OpenERP configuration file (usually `openerp-server.conf` or `odoo.conf` depending on the version) and set:
     ```ini
     [options]
     xmlrpc_interface = 0.0.0.0
     ```

3. **Restart OpenERP Service:**
   - After making the changes, restart the OpenERP service to apply the new configuration.
   - Use the following command to restart the service:
     ```sh
     sudo service openerp-server restart
     ```

4. **Test Access:**
   - Try accessing OpenERP using your external IP address and port 8069 (e.g., `http://8.34.xxx.xx:8069`).

5. **Limit Access to Specific IPs (Optional):**
   - If you want to restrict access to specific IP addresses, you can use the `--allowed_ip_sources` option when starting the OpenERP service. For example:
     ```sh
     --allowed_ip_sources="x.x.x.x"
     ```
   - Additionally, you can create a tag for your GCE instance (e.g., `ERP`) and apply a firewall rule to allow traffic only from your source IP range to this tagged instance. For example:
     ```sh
     gcloud compute firewall-rules create allow-erp --allow tcp:8069 --source-ranges x.x.x.x/xx --target-tags ERP
     ```
