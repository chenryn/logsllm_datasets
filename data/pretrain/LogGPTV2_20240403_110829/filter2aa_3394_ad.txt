### Encryption and System Types
- In all system types, if encryption is utilized, it should be of the same type and use the same key.

### Ability to Handle Multiple Voice and Data Applications
- **Conventional Architecture:**
  - Well-suited for packet-switched data on dedicated channels.
  - Regular Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) channels cannot handle simultaneous voice and high to medium-rate data on a single frequency channel.
- **Trunked Architecture:**
  - Less well-suited for packet data but better suited for circuit-switched data.
  - Regular FDMA channels are unable to handle simultaneous voice and high to medium-rate data on one frequency channel.
- **Hybrid Architecture:**
  - Combines the advantages of conventional technology for packet-switched data transmissions and trunking for circuit-switched data.
  - Regular FDMA channels are unable to handle simultaneous voice and high to medium-rate data on one frequency channel.

### Technology Evolution
- **Conventional Systems:**
  - Used in smaller systems with fewer users and limited frequencies, where the spectral efficiency of trunking is not fully realized.
  - Features include digitalization, an increased set of user features, and strong encryption.
- **Trunked Systems:**
  - Suitable for larger systems with a larger pool of frequencies, allowing for the full realization of trunking advantages and supporting more users per frequency.
  - Features include digitalization, an increased set of user features, and strong encryption.
- **Hybrid Systems:**
  - Used on a case-by-case basis, combining the benefits of both conventional and trunked architectures.

### Policy Impact
- The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) National Plan Report and Order provides incentives for using trunking and encourages small entities with minimal requirements to join together in using a single system, thus promoting the use of trunking in the 800-MHz band.
- The FCC encourages the use of trunking as a spectrum-efficient technology.
- Decentralized trunking is allowed in all Land Mobile Radio (LMR) bands.
- Centralized trunking has been permitted in lower LMR bands, subject to meeting certain licensing requirements.
- Hybrid systems are not specifically defined or addressed by policymakers.

### Comparisons of Conventional and Trunked Systems

#### Compatibility with Legacy Systems
- **Conventional:**
  - New analog conventional systems are generally compatible with legacy analog configurations.
  - Compatibility between current digital conventional systems and legacy analog systems is only via audio patches.
  - TIA/EIA-102 systems are designed to be compatible with legacy analog systems over the air interface.
  - Simultaneously analog and digital systems cannot interoperate over the air interface. The compatible digital system must be switched to analog mode to allow for interoperation with an analog legacy system.
- **Trunked:**
  - Digital trunked systems usually employ a gateway technique for migration from analog systems.
  - Analog/digital compatibility issues apply as for conventional systems.
- **Hybrid:**
  - Since hybrid systems consist of conventional and trunked overlays, all compatibility considerations that apply to the two will be correct for the respective overlays of a hybrid system.

#### Required User Discipline
- **Conventional:**
  - Requires significant user discipline to ensure all users can share the channel.
- **Trunked:**
  - Users do not need to monitor the system for an available channel to make a call.
  - When communicating in their talk group, trunked users must follow the same user discipline rules as conventional users.
- **Hybrid:**
  - Users of the conventional overlay must abide by conventional user discipline.
  - Trunked users do not have to monitor the system for an available channel to make a call, but they must follow the rules applicable to conventional users when communicating in their talk group.

#### Network Management
- **Conventional:**
  - Requires manual management.
- **Trunked:**
  - Many network management features are automated.
- **Hybrid:**
  - A combination of manual and automated management, requiring manual management for the conventional overlay and mostly automated management for the trunked overlay.

#### Network Operator Training
- **Conventional:**
  - Less training required.
  - Large conventional systems may require detailed knowledge of system configuration from operators/dispatchers.
- **Trunked:**
  - More training required for technicians and managers.
  - Requires a good understanding of system configuration from operators/dispatchers.
- **Hybrid:**
  - More training required for technicians and managers.
  - Requires a good understanding of system configuration from operators/dispatchers.

#### Network Cost Effectiveness
- **Conventional:**
  - Generally less expensive than trunked.
  - TIA/EIA-102 systems can be as expensive as trunked due to the use of user authentication equipment.
  - Cost determined by technology used, specific configuration, and user options selected, not by the type of architecture.
- **Trunked:**
  - More expensive than conventional.
  - Cost determined by technology used, specific configuration, and user options selected, not by the type of architecture.
- **Hybrid:**
  - Cost determined by specific configuration, technology used, and user options selected.
  - Some large hybrid systems can be more expensive than similar trunked systems due to the complexity of integrating conventional and trunked components.

### Architecture Analysis and Comparison

#### 5.1 Spectrum Efficiency
- Spectrum efficiency is similar across different architecture types and depends on channelization and multiple access methods.
- Conventional and trunked systems are available in 25 kHz and 12.5 kHz channelizations.
- Exhibit 10 lists various spectrum efficiencies:
  - 25 kHz Analog: 1 channel, 1:1
  - 12.5 kHz Narrowband Analog: 2 channels, 2:1
  - 12.5 kHz Narrowband Digital (TIA/EIA-102 Phase 1): 2 channels, 2:1
  - 6.25 kHz Narrowband Digital (TIA/EIA-102 Phase 2): 4 channels, 4:1

#### 5.2 Grade of Service (GOS)
- GOS is the probability of an inbound communication call being blocked.
- **Conventional:**
  - Blocking occurs when multiple users attempt to place a call simultaneously.
  - Users must manually wait for a free moment to avoid collisions.
- **Trunked:**
  - Blocking occurs when no channels are available.
  - The system places the call in a queue, notifying the user when a channel becomes available.
  - Central controller prevents user interference during peak usage periods.
- **Key Differences:**
  - Conventional systems involve manual call delay and require call retries.
  - Trunked systems involve queuing call delay and prevent call collisions, reducing retries.

#### 5.3 Network Capacity
- **Conventional:**
  - Users "listen then transmit" to maximize capacity.
  - As channel load increases, the chance of message collisions increases, reducing effective throughput.
- **Trunked:**
  - Electronically controlled access to multiple channels prevents message collisions.
  - Provides greater network capacity at peak usage periods.
- **Traffic Modeling:**
  - Trunked systems provide less call delay and greater throughput as traffic load increases.

#### 5.4 Call Setup Time
- **Conventional:**
  - Shorter call setup times, typically 15 milliseconds after pressing the PTT button.
- **Trunked:**
  - Longer call setup times, typically 255 milliseconds, due to additional processes such as central controller processing and radio switching.
- **Digital Conventional (TIA/EIA-102):**
  - Similar call setup time to trunked systems due to added computer processing.
- **Hybrid:**
  - Call setup times vary depending on the specific configuration.
  - Calls over the conventional part have the same setup time as a stand-alone conventional system.
  - Calls over the trunked part have the same setup time as a stand-alone trunked system.
  - Cross-calls (trunked to conventional or vice versa) experience call setup delays similar to trunked systems.

#### 5.5 Network Architecture
- **Conventional:**
  - Can be single-site or multisite systems.
  - Components include base stations/repeaters, satellite receivers, and consoles.
