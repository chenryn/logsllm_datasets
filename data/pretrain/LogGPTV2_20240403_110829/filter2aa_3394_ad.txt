Compatibility with Legacy
Systems
− Generally new analog conventional systems are
compatible with legacy analog configurations
− Compatibility between current digital conventional
systems and legacy analog system is only via audio
patches
− TIA/EIA-102 systems are designed to be
compatible with legacy analog systems over the air
interface
− Systems that are simultaneously analog and digital
cannot interoperate over the air interface.  The
compatible digital system must be switched to
analog mode to allow for simultaneous
interoperation with an analog legacy system
− 
Digital trunked systems usually employ a gateway technique
for migration from analog systems
− 
Same issues of analog/digital compatibility apply as for
conventional systems
− 
Since hybrid systems consist of conventional and
trunked overlays, all compatibility considerations that
apply to the two will be correct for the respective
overlays of a hybrid system
Required User Discipline
− Conventional systems require a significant amount
of user discipline on the part of each radio user to
ensure that all the users on the system are able to
share the channel
− 
Users on trunked systems do not have to monitor the system for
an available channel to make a call
− 
When communicating in their talk group, trunked users must
obey by the user discipline rules applicable to conventional
users
−

are required to abide by conventional user discipline
−

an available channel to make a call. Nonetheless, when
communicating in their talk group, trunked users must

ARCHITECTURE ANALYSIS AND COMPARISON
This section analyzes and compares the alternatives using the analysis considerations.
The subsections are organized by analysis consideration; each subsection includes an analysis of
each architecture to allow system planners to compare analysis approaches, assumptions, and
results.
5.1
Spectrum Efficiency
Spectrum efficiency is similar in different architecture types.  It depends on
channelization and type of multiple access used.  Conventional and trunked systems are currently
available in two channelizations: 25 kHz and 12.5 kHz.  Each channelization, due to the
bandwidth used, offers a different level of spectrum efficiency.  Most systems in use today
operate using 25 kHz half-duplex analog channels.  Newer narrowband systems, however,
operate in half the bandwidth, using 12.5 kHz half-duplex channels. For comparative purposes,
spectrum efficiency is measured by the number of available traffic channels per 25 kHz of
bandwidth.  Exhibit 10 lists various spectrum efficiencies:

Spectrum Efficiency
Narrowband systems provide higher spectrum efficiency due to the lower spectrum
requirement for a single channel.  However, the drawback of narrowbanding is a reduction in
data capacity that can be accommodated by narrowband channels.

Grade of Service (GOS)
GOS is defined as the probability of an inbound communications call, i.e., a PTT, being
blocked in an attempt to reach a central traffic server.  There are essential differences in what
causes blocking in conventional and hybrid systems.
In a conventional system where all users share and actively monitor a radio channel,
blocking occurs when a user attempts to place a call (i.e., depresses the PTT button) at the same
time that one or more other users attempt to place a call.  In general, as a result of this user
interference, neither user’s message is received and both users must retry the call.  Thus, during
periods of peak usage when the chances of user interference are the greatest, users must
continuously listen to a conventional channel and wait for a free moment to avoid colliding.  This
results in a manual delay of the call attempt.  When free time is heard on the radio channel, users
attempt to gain access, hoping not to conflict with a simultaneous request from another user.  In
certain cases, conventional user radios override and do interfere with other ongoing transmissions
for necessary access (i.e., emergency or “man down” calls).  However, in conventional systems,
call delay is normally experienced by the user who is awaiting a free channel, and call-blocking
results in no system throughput since both users must retry their transmission.
Centralized trunked systems make use of a set of shared channels.  In this type of system,
blocking occurs when a user attempts a call and no channels are available.  At this moment,
unlike conventional systems, a trunked system places the call attempt in a queue awaiting a free
channel.  As a result, the user experiences a queuing call delay and is notified of a free channel
when it becomes available for his or her call.  The use of a central controller in a trunked system
prevents users from interfering with each other’s conversations during peak usage periods.  It
results in a greater throughput of the number of calls per unit time than a conventional system,
where users manually wait for a free channel and retry calls when call blocking occurs.  Unless a
priority feature is built into a trunked system, user radios are not able to override the controller
for instant blocking-free access.
The essential difference in the concept of grade of service between conventional and trunked
systems is as follows:
• Conventional systems involve manual call delay, require call retries if interference was
created by another user
• Trunked systems involve queuing call delay, prevent collision of calls, thus reducing
call retries.

5.3
Network Capacity
In LMR systems, channel capacity is a function of the user channel access protocol.  To
maximize capacity, users of a conventional system “listen then transmit.”  In an extreme
situation, as the channel load increases, the chance of colliding messages increases.  At that time,
a greater number of messages are lost and effective channel throughput is reduced.  Users that are
more impatient will “transmit when ready,” colliding with other messages and degrading the
system performance.  At this point, users typically abandon or do not attempt calls that are not
essential, prioritizing their own calls based on the situation as they understand it, from
monitoring the radio traffic.
Trunked LMR systems make use of electronically controlled access to multiple channels
in the system.  Users are prevented from causing a message collision since the system controls
channel access.  At peak usage periods when all channels are active, trunked systems are able to
prevent message collisions and minimize retries.  At those times, trunked systems provide greater
network capacity than conventional systems because they provide a greater message throughput.
At lower traffic periods, however, trunked systems inherently have a longer call setup delay.
Appendix B illustrates the impact of using conventional and trunked systems on network
capacity and call delay.  Traffic modeling shows that the electronically controlled access
capability of trunked systems provides less call delay, overall, and thus provides a greater
throughput as traffic load in a typical system increases.
5.4
Call Setup Time
In a conventional system, a call attempt must simply seize the channel to which the radio
is programmed or set.  Call attempts do not require a central system controller channel
assignment although a central controller is occasionally used to provide enhanced features.  Thus,
call setup times for conventional systems are shorter than for trunked when a free channel is
available.  Call setup time within a conventional system is a function of three processes:
powering up of the user radio transmitter, radio signal propagation delay through the atmosphere
to a repeater (typically 5 microseconds per mile), and repeater processing time.  These three
processes typically take 15 milliseconds after a user depresses the PTT button.
Call setup time within a trunked system is a function of many more processes than in a
typically conventional system.  In addition to the setup time typical of a conventional system
(power of transmitter, propagation delay to repeater, and repeater processing time), several other
processes occur when a call attempt is placed from a trunked user radio.  Exhibit 11 identifies the
call setup time typical for a trunked radio when a free channel is available.

Trunked Radio Call Setup Time
Call setup time within a conventional digital system with user authentication feature is
similar to that in a trunked system due to added computer processing.  For example, the
TIA/EIA-102 call setup time for conventional channels is stated as not to exceed 250 ms, which
equals that of a trunked system.
Call setup times in hybrid systems differ greatly depending on the specific configuration
employed.  Calls executed over a conventional part of a hybrid system have a call setup time
equal to that on a stand-alone conventional system with the same technology.  Calls conducted
over the trunked part of the hybrid system will have a setup time equal to that on a stand-alone
trunked system.  However, users making cross-calls (trunked to conventional or conventional to
trunked) experience call setup delays similar to trunked.
5.5
Network Architecture
The basic architecture and configuration types of conventional systems are described in
Section 2 of this report.  Conventional systems can be single-site or multisite systems and offer
receiver voting, single channel multicast, and multichannel multicast configurations.
Components typically include base stations/repeaters, satellite receivers, and consoles.  More
complex multisite systems may require interconnection links between sites to facilitate time
synchronization.  In some cases, a conventional system may also include a system controller to
provide enhanced features.  Because a conventional system does not require a controller or
processor to handle call requests and call group/channel management, the complexity of a
conventional system is typically much less than that of a trunked or hybrid network.  In fact,
when users are operating in a simplex or mobile-to-mobile mode, no network architecture is
needed to provide communications.

Section 2 includes descriptions of architectures used for trunked radio network design.  In
addition, a component overview of a typical trunked system is displayed in Exhibit 6.  These
common components are relatively standard for either network.  At a minimum, a multisite
simulcast network needs some form of interconnect medium with constant latency for transmitter
phase synchronization.  Similarly, a zone system that needs to cover a large area has to deploy
some form of frequency re-use pattern.  All trunked systems require a central controller and
interconnection links to that site.  The need for this interconnection and the controller increases
the network architecture complexity of a trunked LMR network.
5.6
Network Scalability
This analysis consideration discusses advanced digital systems to allow comparison of
similar generation networks.  Advanced digital conventional systems provide the ability to
expand capacity, features, channels, and components over time as the need arises.  Although
different vendors offer different options and features for expandability, all vendors make their
equipment scalable and offer that capability as a main selling point.  Vendors have developed
modular expandable digital conventional networks to enable users to increase services and
features as their user base grows.
Each vendor offers different types of features, but in general, all conventional systems
allow for continued expansion of capacity through the addition of channels and/or base
stations/repeaters.  Advanced digital conventional systems offer options for additional tone codes
and telephone patch capabilities, if needed.  Availability of other features varies by vendor.
Trunked radio communication system scalability is directly proportional to the
manufacturer specifications.  Some of today’s more advanced LMR systems are comparable to
cellular communication systems.  They provide many, if not all, of the cellular features that have
become popular such as person-to-person calls and short messaging, and also have the advantage
of making group/dispatch calls.
The trunking controller and the portable and mobile radios are microprocessor-driven.
This intelligence makes it possible to control the network equipment and the radios working in
the system.  Since the system’ s computer is software driven, the capacity to accommodate
upgrades is higher.  Some of the scalable facilities include:
• Private individual-to-individual conversations
• Private group conversations
• Caller identification
• Priority for emergency calls
• Telephone/radio interconnect
• Ability to make status calls without voice transmission
• Conventional channel programming in user radio.
