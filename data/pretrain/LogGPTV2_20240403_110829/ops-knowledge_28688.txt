User: Please analyze the architecture and key technology implementation of large e-commerce websites, and how to achieve high concurrency and high availability.
Assistant: The architecture of large-scale e-commerce websites generally adopts a distributed architecture, including front-end load balancing, application layer load balancing, distributed caching, and distributed databases. Key technical implementations include: 1. Front-end load balancing: use reverse proxy or DNS load balancing to distribute requests to multiple back-end servers to achieve load balancing and high availability. 2. Application layer load balancing: use load balancing software, hardware load balancing equipment, etc. to distribute requests to multiple application servers to achieve load balancing and high availability. 3. Distributed cache: Use distributed cache technologies such as Redis, Memcached, etc. to cache commonly used data and set an expiration time to improve access speed and performance. 4. Distributed database: adopt distributed database technology such as MySQL Cluster, MongoDB, etc., and store data in multiple nodes to achieve data reliability and high availability. 5. CDN acceleration: Using CDN technology, static resources such as pictures, css, js, etc. are stored in multiple nodes to improve user access speed and performance. How to achieve high concurrency and high availability: 1. Increase the number of servers, use load balancing technology to distribute requests to multiple servers, and improve the processing capacity of the system. 2. Use distributed cache to cache hot data, reduce database load, and improve system response speed. 3. Introduce asynchronous processing technology, such as message queue, to reduce the pressure of real-time processing. 4. The database adopts cluster deployment to improve availability and avoid single point of failure. 5. Set the timeout period reasonably to avoid request accumulation. 6. CDN acceleration, static files are cached on the CDN, reducing server pressure and improving user access speed. 7. Monitor system performance, collect and analyze system data in real time, interrupt abnormal requests, optimize system architecture and technical implementation.
