`sphinx-gallery` was originally created from matplotlib's code to create a
sphinx gallery but has since been packaged properly, and evolved to have more
features and be more robust to sphinx build systems.
It has a couple of nice features that come out of the box including better
formatting of gallery examples docstrings (see [1]), easy linking to
documentation examples (specifically, deals with converting examples to rst
_and_ updating those, while our builds symlinks or copies stuff around, which
makes moving to the Makefile system a bit more painful on our end).
I suggest that we integrate sphinx-gallery in several steps to make the pull
request smaller and easier to review:
  * All gallery examples should be documented with a docstring that includes a title at the top of the file.
  * All example folders containing plots should also contain a readme file
  * Example files that plot an element should be renamed `plot_filename.py` to be rendered properly by sphinx-gallery.
