User: I'm new to python and I'm attempting to run a script provided to me that requires to input the name of a text file to run. I changed my pathing to include the Python directory and my input in the command line - "python name_of_script.py" - is seemingly working. However, I'm getting the error: "the following arguments are required: --input". This makes sense, as I need this other text file for the program to run, but I don't know how to input it on the command line, as I'm never prompted to enter any input. I tried just adding it to the end of my command prompt line, but to no avail.
Does anybody know how this could be achieved?
Thanks tons

it means that you need to make your code aware the command line argument. Unless you do some fancy command line processing, for which you need to import optparse or argparse, try:
import sys
# do something with sys.argv[-1] (ie, the last argument)
