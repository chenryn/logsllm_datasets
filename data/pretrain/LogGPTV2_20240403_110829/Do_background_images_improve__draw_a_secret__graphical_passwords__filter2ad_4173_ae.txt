### Slightly Different Outcome

In a slightly different outcome, the most common creations were random constructions of lines and shapes that held no significant meaning for the participants. These participants often lacked drawing ideas at the start of the experiment. Such constructions accounted for 30% of the drawings, while the previously mentioned group of everyday objects accounted for 20%. The most interesting creations included a basketball and backboard, and one participant’s name written in very complex Persian script (see Figure 9). Both of these were successfully repeated in the recall tests and were of high complexity.

### Participant Feedback

At the end of both experiments, participants were asked for their opinions on the schemes to which they were assigned. More capable artists expressed satisfaction with both BDAS and DAS. Those who were less capable remarked that they preferred using traditional passwords over DAS or BDAS. Participants using DAS were then introduced to BDAS, and most claimed they would have found BDAS more stimulating, especially if they could use their own images as a background.

### Weak Passwords

It was not surprising that there were very weak passwords in both groups in each user study. For example, in the first user study, one subject in the BDAS group created a secret with a stroke count of 2 and a password length of 10, while another subject in the DAS group created a secret with a stroke count of 2 and a password length of 13. Their corresponding maximum password spaces, according to [13], were about 26.9 and 32.7 bits, respectively.

We did not expect that the BDAS scheme would eliminate all weak password choices. Instead, low-quality passwords in both DAS and BDAS schemes should be disallowed by proactive password checking [18]. As BDAS increases secret complexity, the likelihood that a user's secret would pass proactive checking is increased. A usable BDAS implementation in combination with proactive checking could potentially be a viable authentication solution. We believe that proactive checking would be more obstructive when applied to DAS due to our experience of people setting comparatively weaker passwords.

We have implemented GraphiCheck, a proactive checker for DAS and BDAS graphical passwords. An empirical evaluation of this tool is ongoing and beyond the scope of the present paper.

### Recall Errors

In the majority of cases where participants made an incorrect recall, the overall image of their secrets was at least roughly remembered. Many recall failures were due to mixing up the order of the strokes in a secret or forgetting the starting point of symmetrical shapes such as circles or squares.

For example, the only recall failure in the 5-minute test of Study 2 was for the secret shown in Figure 10(a), a stick man. The problem was not remembering the overall secret but the starting point of the head. The original starting point is indicated by the red dot in the image, and the participant's attempts are shown by the blue dots.

Recall failure in the 1-week test occurred with the participant using the secret shown in Figure 10(b). Visually, the participant correctly repeated the appearance of the drawing each time; however, it proved too difficult to remember the stroke order, especially around the intricate work required for the eyes.

Similar cases were observed in our first study. One participant created a car with detailed features like headlights and doors (strokes: 8, password length: 36, background: PLANT). In the 5-minute recall, the participant struggled to remember the order in which everything was drawn, despite perfectly recalling the features of the image.

These cases echo the observation by Goldberg et al. that people have difficulty remembering the order of strokes, even though they can memorize the drawings [6]. Stroke order being an important determinant of correct secret recall was met with frustration by many participants in our experiments. Those who did not initially understand this tended to create more complex drawings. Once this understanding dawned upon them, their creations became much simpler.

Another interesting failure case occurred in the 1-week test of Study 2. A participant created a secret as in Figure 11(a). He had no problem recreating it in the 5-minute test, but a week later, he could not do better than producing the secret as in Figure 11(b). The overall proportions of the secret were remembered correctly, but the details of positioning were not. It is interesting to note that the participant admitted defeat after 6 attempts, 3 more than allowed. Upon introduction to BDAS after the experiment, he thought he would have been greatly assisted by the background image, which would have enabled him to map his lines to part of a meaningful background rather than white space.

Another interesting case of memory decay over a week occurred in our first study. One participant successfully recalled his secret, a tea cup drawing with (1, 4) as the starting cell (see Figure 8(a)), in the 5-minute test. However, the steam represented by a number 2-like shape as shown in Figure 12(a) manifested itself as an 'S' shape a week later (Figure 12(b)). The rest of the cup was reproduced correctly up to that point.

### Starting Cells

We also observed that BDAS increased the distribution of cells people would use to start their drawing. Observing DAS in both studies, we found that right-handed participants were most likely to start drawing between the center of the grid and the far left. In the first study, 100% (9/9) of right-handed participants followed this trend, while in Study 2, this was 78% (14/18). BDAS improved this, with 75% (6/8) behaving this way in Study 1 and 48% (10/21) in Study 2.

The small number of left-handed participants in both studies means a similar conclusion could not be reached. A study more evenly populated with left-handed participants would be required to validate any trend.

### Implementation Considerations

Observations from the two user studies suggest the following enhancements to the implementation of DAS and BDAS:

- **Step-by-step Undo**: An overarching theme across both studies was that participants from both groups made errors and wanted to remove particular strokes from the grid. This suggests that a user-friendly DAS/BDAS implementation should support functionalities such as step-by-step undo.
- **Fuzzy Boundaries**: Another observation was that most users initially had difficulty constructing a secret that obeyed the restriction of grid crossings that traced grid lines, or entered the so-called "fuzzy boundaries." This effect was reduced with BDAS, although not eradicated. Users often found the grid lines to be the most natural point of reference when drawing their secret. This was a major factor in distributing practice grids in our experiment. Therefore, the same observation by Nali and Thorpe [8] is confirmed by our experiment. This kind of user error could be dealt with by the step-by-step undo discussed above, but details of such an event must be communicated effectively to avoid confusion. On the other hand, this could also indicate that an enhanced drawing encoding system that embraces interaction with the gridlines is more feasible.
- **Enrolment**: Initially, some participants found the process of creating a valid secret difficult. However, many were confident that practice would ultimately improve their technique. We believe that any usable implementation of DAS/BDAS (and other graphical password systems) must introduce a period of enrolment, so that the user can practice and commit to memory the drawing they have created. We also observed in our studies that the attempts of participants in both groups were much more hesitant in re-creating their drawings in the 1-week recall test. Participants often held their pen down in the same location for an extended period of time while they were thinking. It is likely that such an effect would also be reduced by an effective enrolment process. Learning by repetition is a weak way to remember anything. An ideal enrolment process in graphical password systems should focus on leading the user through a process that prompts a more reflective [9] encoding in memory.

### Other Observations

One interesting observation was that users with non-technical backgrounds had much more difficulty understanding the DAS scheme than those with a technical disposition. This appears to suggest that "easy to describe" and "easy to understand" might be important concerns when designing new graphical password schemes.

### Conclusions and Future Work

Two comparative user studies have shown that introducing background images to the original DAS scheme is an effective enhancement. With the aid of a background image, people tended to construct significantly more complicated passwords than their counterparts using the original scheme, and other predictable characteristics such as global symmetry and centering within the drawing grid that led to weak DAS passwords were also reduced. The background image also improved the memorability of passwords. Although people aided by a background image had to recall significantly more complicated passwords, the former performed just as well as the latter in terms of recall success in tests conducted 5 minutes and 1 week after the passwords were created.

We believe that BDAS is more effective than DAS for both user authentication and key generation. The most exciting feature of BDAS is that, with a simple enhancement, it provides significantly enhanced usability and security simultaneously.

This work provides a significant extension to the study of security and usability of graphical passwords. Results obtained in our experiments are thought-provoking and pave the road for numerous further studies.

A number of experimental improvements are as follows:
- First, although this has been the largest user study of the DAS scheme so far, the experiment could be carried out on an even larger scale.
- Second, the participants taking part in our studies had no incentive to perform as if protecting or accessing anything of real-life value to them. Developing a scenario where the user has some real benefit from performing desirably and some cost from not doing so would be a useful advance to research when studying user password security.
- Also, the next logical step would be to move the experiment out of the laboratory and test it in an environment that mirrors more closely the real process of logging into a system. Many new ideas work well in the laboratory but fail when put into mainstream existence.

We have implemented the BDAS scheme on PDAs, and we plan to run this study with this actual implementation on a larger scale in the near future. We will also carry out detailed studies to compare the effect of different background image choices on password complexity and memorability, to ascertain what will make good background images, and to compare the memorability of passwords in this enhanced DAS scheme and ordinary textual passwords. Not only would this larger-scale study be more ecologically valid, but it would also allow for more extensive and thorough statistical testing.

Furthermore, as in other settings, shoulder-surfing and interference between multiple passwords are concerns for BDAS too. We have plans to investigate these issues. For example, we have designed a BDAS variant that provides shoulder-surfing resistance, and a user study evaluating its effectiveness and usability is our ongoing work.
