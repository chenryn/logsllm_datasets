slightly different outcome where the most common creations were 
random  constructions  of  lines  and  shapes  with  no  significant 
meaning to the participant. The participants associated with these 
creations  were  often  short  of  drawing  ideas  when  starting  the 
experiment.  Such  constructions  accounted  for  30%  of  drawings 
while the aforementioned group of everyday objects accounted for 
20%. The most interesting creations were that of a basketball and 
a backboard, and one participant’s name written in very complex 
Persian script (see Figure 9). Both were successfully repeated in 
the recall tests and were of high complexity. 
At  the  end  of  both  experiments  participants  were  asked  their 
opinions  of  the  schemes  to  which  they  were  assigned.  The 
participants who were more capable artists expressed contentment 
using  both  BDAS  and  DAS.  Those  who  were  not  so  capable 
remarked they were happier using passwords rather than DAS or 
BDAS.  Those  using  DAS  were  then  introduced  to  BDAS  and 
most  claimed  they  would  have  found  BDAS  to  be  more 
stimulating  to  use,  especially  if  they  were  able  to  use  their  own 
images as a background. 
7.4 Weak Passwords 
It  is  not  surprising  that  there  were  very  weak  passwords  in  both 
groups in each user study. For example, in the first user study, one 
subject in the BDAS group created a secret with a stroke count of 
2  and  a  password  length  of  10,  and  another  subject  in  the  DAS 
group  created  a  secret  that  had  a  stroke  count  of  two  and  a 
password  length  of  13.  Their  corresponding  maximum  password 
spaces,  according  to  [13],  were  about  26.9  and  32.7  bits, 
respectively.  
We  did  not  expect  that  the  BDAS  scheme  would  eliminate  all 
weak password choices. Rather, low-quality passwords in both the 
DAS  and  BDAS  schemes  should  be  disallowed  by  proactive 
password  checking  [18].  As  BDAS  increases  secret  complexity, 
the likelihood that a user secret would pass proactive checking is 
increased.  A  usable  BDAS  implementation  in  combination  with 
proactive  checking  could  potentially  be  a  usable  authentication 
solution.  We  believe  that  proactive  checking  would  be  more 
obstructive when applied to DAS due to our experience of people 
setting comparatively weaker passwords. 
We have implemented, GraphiCheck, a proactive checker for DAS 
and BDAS graphical passwords. An empirical evaluation of such a 
tool is ongoing work, and is beyond the scope of the present paper.  
7.5 Recall Errors  
In  the  majority  of  cases  where  participants  made  an  incorrect 
recall,  the  overall  image  of  their  secrets  was  at  least  roughly 
remembered.  The  nature  of  many  recall  failures  was  down  to 
either mixing up the order of the strokes in a secret, or forgetting 
the starting point of a symmetrical shape such as a circle or square.  
For example, the only recall failure in the 5-minute test of Study 2 
was  for  the  secret  shown  in  Figure  10(a),  a  stick  man.  The 
problem encountered was not remembering the overall secret, but 
remembering the starting point of the head. The original starting 
point  is  indicated  by  the  red  dot  in  the  image,  his  attempts  are 
shown by the blue dots.

Figure 10. Secrets failed to recall (a) in the 5-minute test, 
Study 2, (b) in the 1-week test, Study 2 
Recall failure in the 1-week test occurred to the participant using a 
secret  shown  in  Figure  10(b).  Visually,  the  participant  correctly 
repeated  the  appearance  of  his  drawing  each  time;  however  it 
proved to be too difficult to remember the stroke order, especially 
where intricate work was required round the eyes.  
We spotted similar cases in our first study. One participant created 
a car including detail such as the headlights and doors (strokes: 8, 
password length: 36, background: PLANT). In the 5-minute recall, 
the  participant  was  overwhelmed  by  remembering  the  order  in 
which everything was drawn, despite remembering the features of 
the image perfectly.  
The  above  cases  all  echo  the  observation  by  Goldberg  et  al that 
people  have  difficulty  in  remembering  the  order  of  strokes 
although they can memorise the drawings [6]. In fact, stroke order 
being  an  important  determinant  of  correct  secret  recall  was  met 
with exasperation by many participants in our experiments. Those 
who  did  not  initially  understand  this  tended  to  create  more 
complex  drawings 
this 
understanding dawned upon them, their creations were changed to 
appear much simpler.

Another  interesting  failure  case  occurred  in  the  1-week  test  of 
Study 2. A participant created a secret as in Figure 11(a). He had 
no problem in recreating it in the 5-minute test, but a week later he 
could not do better than producing the secret as in Figure 11(b). 
As  can  be  seen  the  overall  proportions  of  the  secret  were 
remembered  correctly.  However  the  details  of  positioning  were 
not.  It  is  interesting  to  note  that  the  participant  admitted  defeat 
after 6 attempts, 3 more than allowed. Upon introduction to BDAS 
after  the  experiment,  he  thought  he  would  have  been  assisted 
greatly by the background image. The image would have enabled 
him  to  map  his lines  to  part  of a  meaningful  background,  rather 
than white space.

Another  interesting  case  of  memory  decaying  over  a  week 
occurred  in  our  first  study.  One  participant  successfully  recalled 
his secret, a tea cup drawing with (1, 4) as the starting cell (see 
Figure 8(a), in the 5-minute test. However, the steam represented 
by  a  number  2  like  shape  as  shown  in  Figure  12(a)  manifested 
itself as an ‘S’ shape as in Figure 12(b) a week later. The rest of 
the cup was reproduced correctly up to that point. 
implementation  would 
7.6 Starting Cells 
We  also  observed  that  BDAS  increased  the  distribution  of  cells 
people would use to start their drawing. Observing DAS in both 
studies we found that right handed participants were most likely to 
start drawing between the centre of the grid and the far left.  In the 
first study we found that 100% (9/9) of right-handed participants 
followed this trend, while in study 2 this was 78% (14/18).  BDAS 
bettered this as 75% (6/8) behaved this way in study 1 followed by 
48% (10/21) in study 2.  
The  small  number  of  left-handed  participants  for  both  studies 
means  that  a  similar  conclusion  could  not  be  reached.  A  study 
more  evenly  populated  with  left-handed  participants  would  be 
required to validate any trend.  
7.7 Implementation Considerations  
Observations  in  the  two  user  studies  suggest  the  following 
enhancements to implementation of DAS and BDAS. 
Step-by-step  undo.  An overlying theme across both studies was 
that  participants  from  both  groups  made  errors  and  wanted  to 
remove particular strokes from the grid. This suggests that a user-
friendly  DAS/BDAS 
ideally  support 
functionalities such as step-by-step undo. 
Fuzzy  boundaries.  Another  observation  was  that  most  users 
initially  had  difficulty  constructing  a  secret  that  obeyed  the 
restriction  of  grid  crossings  that  traced  grid  lines,  or  entered  the 
so-called ‘fuzzy boundaries’. This effect was reduced with BDAS 
although not eradicated. Users often found the grid lines to be the 
most  natural  point  of  reference  when  drawing  their  secret.  This 
was a major factor in distributing practice grids in our experiment. 
Therefore,  the  same  observation  by  Nali  and  Thorpe  [8]  is 
confirmed  by  our  experiment.  This  kind  of  user  error  could  be 
dealt with by the step-by-step undo discussed above, but details of 
such an event must be communicated effectively so as to avoid the 
inevitable  confusion  of  why  the  user  cannot  make  such  a 
seemingly elementary move. On the other hand, this could also be 
an  indication  that  an  enhanced  drawing  encoding  system  that 
embraces interaction with the gridlines is more feasible.  
Enrolment.  Initially,  some  participants  found  the  process  of 
creating  a  valid  secret  difficult.  However  many  were  confident 
that  practice  would  ultimately  improve  their  technique.  We 
believe that any usable implementation of DAS/BDAS (and other 
graphical password systems) must introduce a period of enrolment, 
so that the user can practice and commit to memory the drawing 
they have created.  
We also observed in our studies that the attempts of participants in 
both groups were much more hesitant in re-creating their drawings 
in the 1-week recall test. Participants often held their pen down in 
the same location for an extended period of time while they were 
thinking. It is likely that such an effect would also be reduced by 
an effective enrolment process. 
Learning by repetition is a weak way to remember anything. An 
ideal  enrolment  process  in  graphical  password  systems  should 
focus towards the user being led through a process that prompts a 
more reflective [9] encoding in memory. 
7.8 Others  
One  interesting  observation  was  that  users  with  non-technical 
backgrounds  had  much  more  difficulty  understanding  the  DAS 
scheme  than  those  of  a  technical  disposition.  This  appears  to 
suggest that “easy to describe” and “easy to understand” might be 
important  concerns  when  designing  new  graphical  password 
schemes. 
than 
8. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK  
Two  comparative  user  studies  have  shown  that  it  is  an  effective 
enhancement to introduce background images to the original DAS 
scheme.  With  the  aid  of  a  background  image,  people  tended  to 
construct  significantly  more  complicated  passwords  than  their 
counterparts  using  the  original  scheme,  and  other  predictable 
characteristics such as global symmetry and centering within the 
drawing grid that led to weak DAS passwords were also reduced. 
The  background  image  also  improved  the  memorability  of 
passwords. Although people aided by a background image had to 
recall  significantly  more  complicated  passwords 
their 
counterparts using DAS, the former performed just as well as the 
latter in terms of recall success in tests conducted 5 minutes and 1 
week after the passwords were created.  
We believe that BDAS is more effective than DAS both for user 
authentication and for key generation. The most exciting feature of 
BDAS is that, with a simple enhancement, it provides significantly 
enhanced usability and security simultaneously. 
We believe that this work provides a significant extension to the 
study  of  security  and  usability  of  graphical  passwords.  Results 
obtained  in  our experiments are  thought-provoking  and  pave  the 
road to numerous further studies.  
A number of experimental improvements are as follows. First, al-
though this has been the largest user study of the DAS scheme so 
far, the experiment could be carried out on an even larger scale.  
Second, the participants taking part in our studies had no incentive 
to perform as if protecting or accessing anything of real-life value 
to them. Development of a scenario where the user has some real 
benefit from performing desirably and some cost from not, would 
be  a  useful  advance  to  research  when  studying  user  password 
security.   
Also, the next logical step would be to move the experiment out of 
the laboratory as it were and test it in an environment that mirrors 
more closely the real process of logging into a system. Many new 
ideas  work  well  in  the  laboratory  but  when  put  into  mainstream 
existence are completely debunked.  
We have implemented the BDAS scheme on PDAs, and we plan 
to run this study with this actual implementation on a larger scale 
in  the  near  future.  We  will  also  carry  out  detailed  studies  to 
compare the effect of different background image choices on pass-
word  complexity  and  memorability,  to  ascertain  what  will  make 
good  background  images,  and  to  compare  the  memorability  of 
passwords  in  this  enhanced  DAS  scheme  and  ordinary  textual 
passwords.  Not  only  would  this  larger  scale  study  be  more 
ecologically  valid,  but  would  also  allow  for  more  extensive  and 
thorough statistical testing. 
Furthermore, as in other settings, shoulder-surfing and interference 
between multiple passwords are concerns for BDAS too. We have 
plans to investigate these issues. For example, we have designed a 
BDAS variant that provides shoulder-surfing resistance, and a user 
study  evaluating  its  effectiveness  and  usability  is  our  ongoing 
work.
