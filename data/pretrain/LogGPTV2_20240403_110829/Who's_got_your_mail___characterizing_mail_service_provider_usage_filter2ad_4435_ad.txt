### 4.4 Providers and Companies

After collecting the data, we use a priority-based approach (described in Section 3) to determine the mail providers for the domains. Our methodology outputs provider IDs, which are typically registered domains. For example, our methodology tags `google.com` as the provider ID for `netflix.com`, as shown in Table 1. The provider ID `google.com` can then be associated with the mail service provider company, Google. However, a single company may have multiple provider IDs, which can result from different services operated by the company or different sources of data (such as certificates, Banner/EHLO messages, or MX records) used to derive the provider ID.

Table 5 illustrates various provider IDs used by Microsoft and ProofPoint, identified in our datasets, along with the ASN information of the mail infrastructure.

For our analyses, we aim to aggregate the registered domains that make up provider IDs into the companies that operate these names. This step requires some manual work, making a comprehensive analysis of all providers infeasible. Instead, we focus on the most prominent mail providers. We identify frequently-occurring names to determine prominent provider IDs and then map these IDs to companies by examining relevant information (e.g., ASN and the provider ID itself) and conducting online searches. The resulting company information is used as input for our analyses in Section 5.

### 5. Analysis

In this section, we characterize various aspects of mail providers identified for our target set of popular and random domains (Section 4). We analyze the market share, infrastructure, and services provided by the dominant companies in e-mail delivery, their trends over time, particularly focusing on e-mail security services and web hosting companies, the dynamics of domains switching companies over the span of our dataset, and mail provider preferences across different countries.

#### 5.1 Market Share of Top Companies

We start by examining the most popular companies that MX records refer to, using the priority-based approach from Section 3 to identify the most prevalent provider IDs. We then associate these provider IDs with companies (Section 4.4).

Figure 5 shows the top five companies for the three sets of domains in the most recent snapshot in our dataset (June 2021). Since prior work [30, 31] has demonstrated that the nature of domains in Alexa varies with ranks, we also present the top five companies for domains in the Alexa Top 1k, 10k, and 100k. Additionally, for .gov domains, we identify the top five companies separately for federal and non-federal domains.

For Alexa domains of different ranks, the top two are consistently mail hosting providers (Google and Microsoft). For the top 1k, 10k, and 100k domains, the third most popular company is ProofPoint, an e-mail security company. However, when considering all Alexa domains, the third company is Yandex, a Russian mail hosting provider. This likely reflects the presence of many .ru domains in the long tail of Alexa domains.

#### 5.2 Longitudinal Trends

##### 5.2.1 Top Companies

While Figure 5 shows the most recent breakdown for the top companies, we now use the full dataset to examine the breakdown for top companies longitudinally over time.

Figure 6 shows the percentage and number of domains whose MX records point to the top companies over the four years of our dataset. Each curve corresponds to one of the companies. The trends show steady increases over time. The top five companies combined are used by 40.1% of MX records in 2017, and this total increases to 49.0% by June 2021. Google dominates the market with Gmail, followed by Microsoft and Outlook, both of which continue to steadily increase their market share. Google's market share increases from 26.2% to 28.5% from 2017 to 2021, and Microsoft's increases from 7.9% to 10.8%.

Notably, ProofPoint and Mimecast, both e-mail security service providers, are in the top five and have increased their market share over the past four years. We explore the rise of such e-mail security services in more detail in Section 5.2.2.

The "Self-Hosting" curve shows the percentage of domains that host their own SMTP server rather than using a separate provider. We estimate the number of self-hosted domains by looking for domains whose provider ID is the same as its registered domain name. The trend for self-hosting is the opposite of the top companies. The percentage of domains that self-host steadily decreased from 11.7% in 2017 to 7.9% in 2021. Section 5.3 explores where these domains switch to in more detail.

**Figure 6: Market Share of Different Types of Services from 2017 to 2021**

##### 5.2.2 E-mail Security Services

Figure 6a highlights ProofPoint and Mimecast in the top five companies used by popular domains. These companies provide e-mail security services that can operate as a third-party filter for inbound e-mail delivery, removing the need to purchase and manage a local appliance. Customers use MX records to direct mail agents to deliver mail intended for the customer to the security provider, either by explicitly using a provider domain in the MX record (e.g., `ge.com`, which has MX `mx0a-00176a02.pphosted.com`) or by using a customer domain whose A record uses a provider IP address (e.g., `albabotanica.com`, which has MX record `mx1.haingrp.com` that resolves to a ProofPoint IP). The provider then performs spam filtering, phishing detection, URL rewriting, etc., on behalf of the customer and subsequently forwards the mail to the customer’s servers.

The rise of ProofPoint and Mimecast suggests that such companies are becoming more attractive service options. To explore this further, in addition to ProofPoint and Mimecast, we manually identified three other popular companies in the third-party e-mail security market across our datasets. Figures 6b, 6e, and 6h show the percentage of MX records that refer to each of the five prominent third-party e-mail security companies over time for the Alexa, .com, and .gov domains, respectively. The results confirm that these services are becoming increasingly attractive for both popular and random domains, as security incidents via e-mail continue to be a major concern.

##### 5.2.3 Web Hosting Companies

Web hosting companies like GoDaddy make it convenient for hosted domains to use company infrastructure for a variety of services, including e-mail delivery. As seen in Figure 6d, fewer domains over time are taking advantage of hosting company e-mail delivery. We expand upon these results by manually identifying the top five web hosting companies in both datasets.

Figures 6c, 6f, and 6i show the number and percentage of MX records referring to each of these companies in the Alexa, .com, and .gov datasets, respectively. In both cases, the trends are the same. The most popular hosting companies (GoDaddy and UnitedInternet) have fewer domains using their e-mail delivery services over time, and the trend is particularly pronounced among the large sites using popular domains in the Alexa dataset. The remaining hosting companies are comparatively flat.

#### 5.3 Churn

Recall that the set of domains we study have valid MX records for the entire duration of our dataset. During this time, there is churn in the values of the MX records, reflecting administrative decisions about mail delivery. Some domains that initially used Google, for instance, may switch to Microsoft during the four years. Similarly, other domains that were self-hosting might switch to Google.

Figure 7 is a Sankey diagram illustrating changes in MX records between the first snapshot in the Alexa dataset (June 2017) and the last (June 2021). The diagram groups the domains into various categories: the top three third-party mail hosting providers (Google, Microsoft, Yandex); the remaining top 100 providers; self-hosted domains; all other providers; and the residual set that either had no responding SMTP server or timed out during a Censys scan. For each category, the diagram shows the number of domains using that company that did not change, the number of domains that used the company in 2017 but switched to another by 2021 (outgoing flows), and the number of domains that switched to use the company by 2021 (incoming flows).

While the use of the top companies increased over time, the diagram shows that domains from all of the various categories contributed to this increase (e.g., the incoming flows to Google). From the perspective of domains that switched providers, we highlight the changes that occurred to self-hosted domains between 2017 and 2021. More than a quarter of them changed their mail provider to Google or Microsoft — a quantity larger than the sum of domains that switched to providers ranked in the remaining top 100.

#### 5.4 Mail Provider Preferences by Country

Finally, we explore the existence of national biases in e-mail service provider choice. Since we have no easy mechanical way to classify the national origin of individual gTLD domains (such as those in .com), we focused on country code top-level domains (ccTLDs) found in our stable subset of the Alexa top 1M list as a proxy. We consider fifteen ccTLDs: .br (Brazil), .ar (Argentina), .uk (the United Kingdom), .fr (France), .de (Germany), .it (Italy), .es (Spain), .ro (Romania), .ca (Canada), .au (Australia), .ru (Russia), .cn (China), .jp (Japan), .in (India), and .sg (Singapore). We assume, for example, that domains under .ru are likely Russian in origin.

Among the domains in these ccTLDs, we focus on the use of four popular e-mail service providers: Google, Microsoft, Tencent, and Yandex, representing the two dominant e-mail service providers in the US and each of the dominant e-mail service providers in China and Russia, respectively. For each of these four providers, Figure 8 shows the percentage (and absolute number) of domains in each of our ccTLD sets that use the service (June 2021).

There are two clear takeaways. First, Google and Microsoft, the two dominant US-based e-mail service providers, appear to be widely used by organizations outside the US, particularly across Europe, North America, South America, and large parts of Asia, and to a lesser extent, Russia (but not China). For example, 65% of the .br domains in our set host mail with Google or Microsoft, significantly exceeding even the baseline market share for our stable Alexa domains of 39.3%. This is noteworthy because, under US law (particularly as clarified by the recent Cloud Act’s modification to the Stored Communications Act [1]), providers operating in the US can be legally compelled to provide information under their control (including e-mail content) to US law enforcement, regardless of the location of the data or the nationality or residency of the customer using the data.

The second clear result is that Yandex and Tencent are comparatively isolated, primarily serving domains only from the ccTLD matching their own country of origin. The handful of deviations from these patterns primarily reflect domains for companies whose national origin is not reflected by their choice of ccTLD. For example, Shein is a Chinese-owned apparel company that operates in the UK.

It is an open question to what extent this discrepancy is driven entirely by market power and infrastructure deployment (i.e., that domain holders do not consider the jurisdictional risk of hosting mail service with a foreign-owned company and are simply picking those who are best able to support their feature, performance, availability, and price requirements) or if it also reflects an explicit trust decision (i.e., that European and Brazilian companies are sufficiently comfortable being subject to US jurisdiction).
