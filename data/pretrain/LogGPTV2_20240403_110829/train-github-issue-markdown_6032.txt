# Bug report
**What is the current behavior?**  
When trying to run production build of app errors out on
`node dist/main.js`
    TypeError [ERR_INVALID_ARG_TYPE]: The "path" argument must be of type string. Received type number (3320)
`main.js`
    const uiBasePath = path_1.default.dirname(/*require.resolve*/(3320));
**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**  
Use https://github.com/lukepolo/webpack-resolve-bug/tree/main/dist, run `node
dist/main.js` , and you should see the error.

To properly resolve the path as a string
