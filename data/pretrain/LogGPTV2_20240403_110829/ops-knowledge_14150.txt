User: How to protect server from brute force attack? Please provide detailed security setup recommendations and best practices.
Assistant: The security setting recommendations and best practices to protect servers from brute force attacks are as follows: 1. Enhance password security: Require users to set complex passwords, including uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. 2. Limit the number of login attempts: Set the system to automatically lock the user account after the number of failed logins within a certain period of time to prevent malicious logins. 3. Adopt multi-factor authentication: the introduction of multi-factor authentication can improve the security of identity verification, such as using mobile phone text messages or hardware tokens. 4. Firewall settings: deploy a firewall on the server, such as iptables or firewalld, to filter illegal data packets and protect the server. 5. Update and upgrade software patches: Regularly update the operating system and installed software, and apply security patches in a timely manner to avoid exploit attacks of known vulnerabilities. 6. Disable unnecessary services and ports: close unnecessary services and ports, and limit open ports exposed to the outside. 7. Independent export management: Establish an independent export management mechanism on the server to prevent intruders from using familiar software vulnerabilities to attack. For example, SSH needs to disable root login, modify the default port, and use key authentication. 8. Log management: monitor logs in time, record abnormal events and intrusion attempts, and take timely measures to deal with hacker attacks. 9. Data backup and recovery: Regular data backups are performed to prevent data loss and at the same time ensure that data can be restored quickly. 10. Education and training: Strengthen user safety awareness education and training, improve safety awareness, and implement safety operation and maintenance work smoothly.
