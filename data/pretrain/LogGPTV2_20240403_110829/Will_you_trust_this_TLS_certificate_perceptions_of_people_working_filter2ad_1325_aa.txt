## Abstract
Flawed TLS certificates are not uncommon on the Internet. While they often signal potential issues, many have benign causes (e.g., misconfiguration or deliberate deployment). This ambiguity complicates the decision on whether to trust a connection. Little is known about how IT professionals perceive these flawed certificates, despite their decisions impacting numerous end users. Additionally, the influence of error message content and documentation on these perceptions remains unclear.

To address these gaps, we conducted an empirical study with 75 attendees at an industrial IT conference, examining their reactions to different certificate validation errors. We also analyzed the impact of re-worded error messages and redesigned documentation. Our findings indicate that IT professionals have nuanced opinions, with trust decisions far from binary. Self-signed and name-constrained certificates appear to be over-trusted, with the latter being poorly understood. We show that even minor changes in error messages can positively influence resource use, comprehension, and trust assessment. Our reworded error messages and documentation can be directly adopted.

### 1. Introduction
The prevalence of TLS-protected communication on the Internet is increasing, with over 80% of page loads in Google Chrome occurring over HTTPS as of May 2019. For TLS to function, end entities authenticate using X.509 certificates. However, certificate validation errors are common, though not always indicative of a security breach. For example, a self-signed certificate might result from a misconfiguration rather than an attack. Misinterpreting such a certificate could lead to the leakage of user authentication credentials.

Research has identified usability issues in TLS deployment and related tools, as well as other factors beyond system administrators' control, as common root causes. Despite this, most studies on TLS warnings focus on end-user perceptions, while the perceptions of IT professionals remain under-researched. IT professionals' decisions can affect a large number of end users, making it crucial to understand their perceptions of certificate flaws.

In this study, we observed 75 attendees at an industrial IT conference as they investigated different certificate validation errors. We also evaluated the impact of re-worded error messages and redesigned documentation. Our key contributions include:
1. Detailed insights into IT professionals' perceptions of various certificate flaws.
2. Evaluation of the influence of redesigned error messages and documentation on resource use, comprehension, and trust assessment.

### 2. Methodology
To gain insights into participants' perceptions of certificate flaws, we presented them with a scenario-based certificate validation task. Participants were divided into two groups, each receiving different error messages and documentation.

#### 2.1 Procedure
The study consisted of three parts:
1. An introductory questionnaire on previous experience.
2. A certificate validation task with trustworthiness assessment.
3. An exit semi-structured interview followed by an educational debriefing.

All parts were conducted in English, except for the optional Czech interviews. The study had a mixed design, with participants validating five different certificates across two conditions (original or redesigned documentation).

##### 2.1.1 Initial Questionnaire
We inquired about participants' years of employment, formal education, self-reported knowledge of computer security and X.509 certificates, and previous experience with OpenSSL and other certificate manipulation utilities. Participants also completed the Security Behavior Intentions Scale (SeBIS) [16].

##### 2.1.2 Certificate Validation Task
Participants evaluated their trust in five server certificates (in randomized order). The scenario involved implementing a patch for a conference website to support external identity providers (Microsoft, Fedora Project, GitHub, Google, and Facebook). They were asked to investigate and assess the trustworthiness of connections with flawed certificates. The certificates included:
- Hostname mismatch
- Self-signed
- Expired
- Name constraints
- Control (no issues)

Participants could inspect the certificates, browse the Internet, or use local sources. They were asked to rate the trustworthiness of each connection on a 7-point scale.

##### 2.1.3 Post-task Interview
After the task, a semi-structured interview was conducted to gather insights into participants' reasoning. The interviewer clarified any misconceptions during the debriefing.

#### 2.2 Experimental Conditions
Two experimental conditions were deployed:
- **Original**: Current error messages from OpenSSL 1.1.0g-fips with corresponding documentation.
- **Redesigned**: Re-worded error messages with links to custom-written documentation, following principles of warning design proposed by Bauer et al. [7].

#### 2.3 Setting and Recruitment
The study took place at DevConf.CZ 2018, an international community conference for developers, admins, DevOps engineers, testers, and others interested in open-source technologies. The booth featured three Linux workstations, and participation was voluntary. Participants received merchandise for completing the task.

#### 2.4 Participants
From 78 recruited participants, 75 completed all sub-tasks. Participants had an average of 9.55 ± 7.06 years of IT experience, with diverse educational backgrounds. Almost all (91%) had used OpenSSL, and their self-reported security knowledge was 'good' on average.

### 3. Results
Our findings show that IT professionals have nuanced opinions about certificate flaws, with trust decisions far from binary. Self-signed and name-constrained certificates were over-trusted, with the latter being poorly understood. The trust in expired certificates depended on the time elapsed since expiry. Redesigned error messages and documentation positively influenced resource use, comprehension, and trust assessment.

### 4. Conclusion
This study provides valuable insights into IT professionals' perceptions of TLS certificate flaws and the impact of error message content and documentation. Our results highlight the need for improved error messages and documentation to enhance security and usability in TLS deployments.
