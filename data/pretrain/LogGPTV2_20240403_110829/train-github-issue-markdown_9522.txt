### Solved ðŸŽ‰
Starting from v1.10.0, `torch.nn.CrossEntropy()`has an arg
`label_smoothing=0.0` \- API link.

Hi, guys. The type `torch.LongTensor` of target will hinder the implementation
like some methods in reference. So is there a possible to add a `Arg:
label_smoothing` for `torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss()`, or maybe simply add the
docs to show how to convert the `target` into `one-hot vector` to work with
`torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss()` together, or any other simple ways? Thanks.
