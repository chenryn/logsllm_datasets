User: Please explain what load balancing and reverse proxying are, and provide common scenarios for using them.
Assistant: Load balancing refers to a technique to balance the load of each server. Load balancing enables multiple servers to jointly process a request and share their respective loads, so as to improve the processing efficiency and performance of the overall system. Common scenarios include high concurrent access to websites and applications, streaming media transmission of video and audio, etc. Reverse proxy is a kind of proxy service. It acts as a proxy for the request made by the client as a server, transmits the request to the server, obtains the response, and then returns the response to the client. The reverse proxy can hide the real IP address of the server, improve security, and at the same time optimize website performance and prevent server single point of failure. Common scenarios include access to website applications, data services, distributed website services, remote information query, firewalls, etc.
