Example package.json file:
    {
      "paths": {
          "lib_a": "./path/to/lib/a"
       },
       "scripts": {
          "lib_a:build": "tsc -p $npm_package_paths_lib_a",
          "lib_a:publish": "npm publish $npm_package_paths_lib_a"
       },
       "devDependencies": {
          "@my-org/lib-a": "file:$npm_package_paths_lib_a",
       }
    }
As you can see, we have definied variable `$npm_package_paths_lib_a` because
path to the lib is used in 3 places, but for some reason i can not use
variable inside version of dependency. Is there any other syntax for this or
this feature is not supported?
Big picture:  
I have multiple packages inside single repository because i do not want to
duplicate build and deploy process, which is same for multiple UI components.
Also those components are using different dependencies, so when i use lib_a i
do not want to install libraries required for lib_b etc (to make `npm install`
much faster when someone is using only few components).
