User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Access LAN when connected to OpenVPN I have an Asus router with Asuswrt-merlin firmware installed. I have the DHCP server on my router give out addresses in the 192.168.0/24 subnet. My OpenVPN server is configured as seen on this image. The VPN subnet / netmask is 10.8.0.0 / 255.255.255.0. The Push LAN to clients, and both the DNS settings are set as shown in the image.
However I cannot connect to my local LAN when connected to the VPN server through TUN. When I switch to TAP I can make it work because then the VPN subnet / netmask is the same a my local LAN and the connected VPN clients get an IP address from the LAN DHCP pool, however I cannot connect my Android phone/iOS device to the VPN server because they don't support TAP, only TUN.

How can I access my local LAN through TUN?

Assistant: Try these, with these you'll need a username/password accounts setup additionally.... if that doesn't work you'll need to post more details and your logs.

Whenever you make changes, always export and use the new config.
