### III. Method

#### A. Compliance-Standard Audit
In the first phase of this study, our team of six researchers conducted a comprehensive audit of three compliance standards to identify potential security concerns. The objective was to pinpoint issues that could negatively impact digital security, such as policies that expose sensitive information or processes with ambiguous implementation guidance.

1. **Audit Process**:
   - **Initial Audit**: All six researchers independently audited IRS Publication 1075 using a content-analysis process derived from social-science research. Each researcher examined each line of the standard, logging findings at predetermined milestones (e.g., end of a section). For each issue, they recorded the section title, the exact problematic phrase, a description of the issue, and references to related, publicly known issues.
   - **Consensus Building**: If a researcher found multiple issues within one phrase or section, they logged each separately. Other researchers then indicated whether they independently identified the same issue and whether they concurred with the finding. Issues without unanimous consensus were discarded but recorded for future reference.
   - **Inter-Coder Reliability**: We calculated the inter-coder reliability using Krippendorff’s Alpha (α), which accounts for chance agreements. For IRS P1075, we achieved an α = 0.815, indicating high reliability.

2. **Subsequent Audits**:
   - After validating the reliability of the auditing process, the researchers divided into subgroups to audit NERC CIP 007-6 and PCI DSS. Four researchers audited NERC CIP 007-6, and three researchers audited PCI DSS. One researcher (R1) audited all three guidelines. The subgroups attained α = 0.801 and 0.797, respectively.

3. **Issue Categorization**:
   - **Root Causes**: We used iterative open coding to categorize the identified issues. The final codebook described four root causes for security concerns:
     - **Data Vulnerability**: An issue that will result in a data breach or compromise of sensitive information.
     - **Unenforceable Security Control**: A control that cannot be enforced as written.
     - **Under-Defined Process**: A process missing required instructions or details for secure implementation.
     - **Ambiguous Specification**: A specification that is vague or ambiguous, leading to different interpretations.
   - **Probability and Severity**: We defined terms for probability (frequent, likely, occasional, seldom, unlikely) and severity (catastrophic, critical, moderate, negligible). Using a risk assessment matrix, we calculated each issue's risk level as extremely high, high, moderate, or low.

4. **Researcher Qualifications**:
   - The auditing researchers possess an average of 14.3 years of experience in digital security across academia, the federal government, and industry. Additional information about the dataset is provided in Appendix A.

#### B. Expert Validation Process
To validate our findings, we recruited four experts and asked them to assess the identified issues. The validation process involved:

1. **Expert Recruitment**:
   - **Criteria**: Experts must have at least two years of experience with the relevant standard and work directly in compliance.
   - **Participation**: Experts completed surveys during regular work hours, with an average completion time of 84.8 minutes. They did not receive monetary incentives.

2. **Survey Design**:
   - **Pilot Testing**: We piloted the surveys with security practitioners familiar with auditing and compliance standards. Based on feedback, we finalized the questionnaire (Appendix B).
   - **Issue Selection**: We selected a subset of findings to validate, prioritizing extremely-high-risk and high-risk issues.

3. **Validation Categories**:
   - **Confirmed**: The expert has observed the security concern or it exists in an enterprise environment.
   - **Plausible**: The expert agrees the security concern could manifest in other organizations.
   - **Rejected**: There is no observable evidence of the security concern, or related factors were not considered.

4. **Statistical Analysis**:
   - We used the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and Friedman test to compare researchers' assessments of probability and severity with experts' responses.

#### C. Limitations
1. **Self-Selection Bias**: Experts who participated may have been more interested in the study, potentially leading to more critical thinking.
2. **Demand Characteristics**: Experts' intimate knowledge of compliance standards may lead to underestimating problems.
3. **False Negatives**: Our validation method does not elicit feedback on undetected issues, providing a lower bound for validity.
4. **Generalizability**: Partnered organizations may have specific characteristics affecting generalizability. Validating security concerns in these environments does not imply similar issues in all organizations adhering to the same standards.

### IV. Results: IRS P1075

#### A. Overview
IRS Publication 1075 provides mechanisms for protecting and controlling access to Federal Tax Information (FTI). It applies to U.S. federal, state, and local agencies receiving FTI. The 2016 revision, the most current version at the time of the study, was audited.

1. **Key Provisions**:
   - Definitions for terms, authorized access, record-keeping, physical and technical controls, inspection protocols, and sanctions for non-compliance.

#### B. Findings
1. **Total Issues Identified**:
   - 81 independent issues across 309 individual security controls.
   - 2 issues with "Extremely High" risk, 13 with "High" risk, 32 with "Moderate" risk, and 34 with "Low" risk.
   - 15 initially identified issues were discarded due to later clarification or researcher disagreements.

2. **Security Concern Trends**:
   - 5 issues involving portable devices and 7 involving cloud-based data storage solutions.
   - Section 9 had 40 technical controls with security concerns, including obsolete controls like password expiration requirements.

3. **Example Finding**:
   - **Data Vulnerability**: Section 9.3.6.8 outlines backup restoration processes. As written, P1075 does not require verifying backup integrity before restoration, potentially allowing persistent access by attackers. This high-risk issue was assessed as having a likely probability and moderate severity.

### Conclusion
This study provides novel insights into the impact of compliance standards on digital security in enterprise environments. The findings highlight the need for continuous review and updates to ensure robust security measures.
