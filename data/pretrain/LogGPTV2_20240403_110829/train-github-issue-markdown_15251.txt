### Optimized Text

**Challenge:** [Learn How Script Tags and Document Ready Work](http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/waypoint-learn-how-script-tags-and-document-ready-work)

Initially, the text in the third instruction is correct. However, after adding `$(document).ready(function() {`, a closing bracket is missing after `document`. Additionally, I am unable to complete the final instruction for "close," which may be due to my own mistake.

This version of the text is more structured and clear, with proper formatting and a professional tone.
