User: How does one acquire the directory of the Windows Shortcut calling a python script. I'd like to have multiple shortcuts in various places pointing to one script that I could edit if I wanted, but where the directory from which the script is called is accessible. Is this possible? 
This script would likely then be compiled with py2exe or something, so if it is something that isn't possibly until THAT stage, I could go with that. Thanks!
Assistant: In general you cannot obtain this information. You should use argv to switch behaviour of your script.
