Challenge Waypoint: Increment a Number with Javascript has an issue.

Please describe how to reproduce this issue, and include links to screenshots
if possible.
My code:
    var myVar = 87;
    // Only change code below this line
    myVar = myVar++; 
This code returns `87`, but in test is number `88`, for which works `myVar =
++myVar;`, but that does not pass "Use the ++ operator".
