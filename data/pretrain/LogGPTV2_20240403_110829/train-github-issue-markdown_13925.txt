  * Electron version: 1.8.1
  * Operating system: Windows 7
### Expected behavior
I create a `BrowserWindow` with `webPreferences.zoomFactor=0.5`. Everything
looks small (which is expected). Now I close the application and then change
`zoomFactor=1.0`, it should look larger. **But no.** I checked the
`Preferences` file in %appdir%, there is one section `per_host_zoom_levels`,
which I think Electron does not update the values correctly. Please check.
