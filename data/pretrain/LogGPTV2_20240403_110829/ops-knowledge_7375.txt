User: I have installed Anaconda3 just now, and I noticed that now, when I run python command from terminal, Python 3.5.1 |Anaconda 4.0.0 (64-bit)| is starting. Anaconda installer had added path to anaconda dir in $PATH and there is symlink from python to python3.5
My question is: will programs, that depends from python command and expects python2, work correctly, or I should remove symlink python from anaconda dir?

Those programs should use full path of the python binary. Something like /usr/bin/python, and so $PATH is irrelevant. As long as you don't change /usr/bin/python, nothing will break.
If you remove the stuff that Anaconda has added, it's likely that Anaconda will not work properly.
