Question: "In managing the boot security and policy settings for a Mac with Apple silicon, a technician must consider the impact of nonces on the LocalPolicy. What are the potential outcomes or conditions associated with the LocalPolicy Nonce Hash (lpnh) and the RemotePolicy Nonce Hash (rpnh)?"
 "A": "The lpnh is used to prevent replay attacks by ensuring the LocalPolicy in use matches the nonce stored in the Secure Storage Component."
 "B": "The rpnh is updated frequently to prevent unauthorized changes to the LocalPolicy and to reflect the most current user security settings."
 "C": "During software updates, two LocalPolicy Nonce (LPN) values may be simultaneously valid to provide fallback options in case of an update error."
 "D": "The rpnh is designed to be constantly synchronized with the lpnh to prevent any discrepancies in the LocalPolicy across different boot environments."
