User: From my understanding, Celery is a distributed task queue, which means the only thing that it should do is dispatching tasks/jobs to others servers and get the result back. RabbitMQ is a message queue, and nothing more. However, a worker could just listen to the MQ and execute the task when a message is received. This achieves exactly what Celery offers, so why need Celery at all?
Assistant: Celery basically provides a nice interface to doing just what you said, and deals with all the configuration for you. Yes you could do it by hand, but you'd just be rewriting celery.
