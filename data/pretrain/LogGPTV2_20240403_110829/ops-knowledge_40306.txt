User: I'm looking for a detailed documentation about content of files /proc/net/nf_conntrack and/or /proc/net/ip_contrack on Linux systems.
Yes, I know, there are many utilities which can show me the content of these files in human readable format, but... I'd like to do it on a SOHO router, with Tomato USB firmware (by Shibby).
The optware AFAIK deprecated and the entware doesn't contain any of these utilities, so I'd like to write a script instead of them, but I didn't find a detailed description of these files :(
Assistant: The file ip_conntrack contains only ipv4 specific conntrack entries whereas nf_conntrack includes both ipv4 and ipv6 protocol conntrack entries.
nf_conntrack file is registered with proc file system using code in
net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_standalone.c
whereas ip_conntrack file is registered with proc file system through the code in
net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_l3proto_ipv4_compat.c
