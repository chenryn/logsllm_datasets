**Applies to:**
- Windows Server 2022
- Windows Server 2019
- Windows Server 2016
- Windows Server 2012 R2
- Windows Server 2012

**Description:**
The `auditpol list` command is used to display audit policy categories and subcategories, as well as users for whom a per-user audit policy is defined.

**Permissions:**
- To perform list operations on the per-user policy, you must have Read permission for that object set in the security descriptor.
- Alternatively, you can perform list operations if you have the "Manage auditing and security log" (SeSecurityPrivilege) user right. However, this right provides additional access beyond what is necessary for the list operations.

**Syntax:**
```shell
auditpol /list
[/user|/category|/subcategory[:<subcategory_name>|*]]
[/v] [/r]
```

**Parameters:**

- **/user**: Retrieves all users for whom the per-user audit policy has been defined. When used with the `/v` parameter, it also displays the security identifier (SID) of each user.
- **/category**: Displays the names of categories understood by the system. When used with the `/v` parameter, it also displays the category globally unique identifier (GUID).
- **/subcategory**: Displays the names of subcategories and their associated GUIDs. You can specify a specific subcategory name or use `*` to list all subcategories.
- **/v**: Displays the GUID with the category or subcategory, or when used with `/user`, displays the SID of each user.
- **/r**: Displays the output as a report in comma-separated value (CSV) format.
- **/?**: Displays help at the command prompt.

**Examples:**

1. **List all users who have a defined audit policy:**
   ```shell
   auditpol /list /user
   ```

2. **List all users who have a defined audit policy and their associated SIDs:**
   ```shell
   auditpol /list /user /v
   ```

3. **List all categories and subcategories in report format:**
   ```shell
   auditpol /list /subcategory:* /r
   ```

4. **List the subcategories of the "detailed Tracking" and "DS Access" categories:**
   ```shell
   auditpol /list /subcategory:detailed Tracking,DS Access
   ```

This command is useful for administrators who need to manage and review audit policies on Windows servers.
