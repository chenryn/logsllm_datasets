User: I wrote a program that will copy a file called a.exe to C:/Windows/, then I pack it to exe with PyInstaller, and rename the exe file to a.exe. When I run the exe file, it output IOError [Errno 13] Permisson denied: 'C:/Windows/a.exe', but the file a.exe was copied to the directory C:/Windows. Then I ran it as the Administrator, it happened again...
At first, I copy the file with shututil.copy, then I wrote a function myself(open a.exe, create a.exe under C:/Windows, read a.exe 's content and write to C:/Windows/a.exe, close all), but it doesn't help...Any ideas?
Assistant: Check if a.exe has read-only attribute. shutil.copy raises "Permission denied" error when it is called to overwrite existing file with read-only attribute set
