I am currently implementing the remember me functionality. The REMEMBERME
cookie is correctly set, but the logout fails.
What happens is that the LogoutListener is first called on the
GetResponseEvent, but when comming here there is no token in the context, so
the remember me logout is not called and does not delete the cookie. On the
same listener routine, the remember me service is called later on and thus
identifies the user.
Am I doing something wrong, or the listening sequence is wrong ?
_EDIT_ I fixed the issue here, but it was because the remember me service is
not registered as a logout handler automatically.
