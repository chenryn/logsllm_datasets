### Table VI: Test Results for Sharing Malware and Blacklisted URLs

#### Objective
We aimed to test social media platforms for the presence of URL filtering mechanisms. For example, a platform may check if a shared URL is flagged as malicious by existing blacklists, such as Google SafeBrowsing [14]. We used three different blacklisted URLs from PhishTank [23], verified by Google SafeBrowsing [14]. Additionally, we tested whether platforms proactively scan web page content for malware by creating unique links to our server to download the trojan Win32.Virut. This experiment was not conducted for instant messaging (IM) platforms, as downloading mobile apps through a browser is not a major attack vector.

#### Monitoring Points
During our tests, we monitored two key points:
1. **URL Posting**: When the URL is posted.
2. **Link Preview Creation**: When the link preview is generated.

### A. URL Posting
We first examined whether the platforms accept malicious URLs. Only Twitter detected the blacklisted URL as malicious and prevented posting, displaying the following warning message: "This request looks like it might be automated. To protect our users from spam and other malicious activity, we can't complete this action right now. Please try again later." All other platforms did not show any error or warning messages and created a URL preview instead.

### B. Preview Creation
Social media platforms can detect malicious URLs at various stages, but our analysis revealed that most do not implement robust security checks.

- **Malware**: When sharing the malware program, all platforms successfully retrieved the binary from our server. However, since the binary does not contain HTML code, most platforms rendered a minimal link preview. Some platforms (e.g., Facebook, Xing) showed a basic preview, while others (e.g., VK, Pinterest, Tumblr, MeWe) prompted users for more information. Platforms like Twitter, LinkedIn, Medium, and Plurk did not render any preview. Clicking on the link preview resulted in the download of the malware program without any warnings.

- **Blacklisted URL**: When sharing a blacklisted URL, only LinkedIn detected the malicious URL after posting. LinkedIn redirected the link to a modified redirector (linkedin.com/redir/phishing-page?url=$URL). Clicking on the preview led to an informative page explaining that the site was blacklisted according to Google Safe Browsing, thus blocking access to the target URL. Despite repeated attempts, the user account was not deactivated.

Sixteen out of eighteen social media platforms treated blacklisted links as regular links. Their bots visited the page and rendered a preview based on specified meta tags or parsed HTML. Eight platforms (Facebook, VK, MeWe, Messenger, Snapchat, Line, Viber, KakaoTalk) created rich previews indistinguishable from benign links. The remaining eight platforms either showed partial information (page title and host, but no image and no description) or did not render a preview at all.

### C. Key Findings
Our analysis aimed to investigate the presence of mechanisms to prevent the distribution of malicious URLs on social media platforms. The key findings are:

- **General Lack of Countermeasures**: Most platforms do not have widespread countermeasures to prevent the distribution of malicious content at submission time.
- **User Warnings**: Except for Twitter and LinkedIn, platforms do not show specific warnings or error messages, indicating potential danger when clicking on the previews. Link previews for blacklisted URLs can contain the same elements as benign web pages (title, description, picture, domain name).
- **Security Checks**: Only two out of 20 platforms (Twitter and LinkedIn) perform security checks on posted URLs. Twitter forbids posting blacklisted URLs, while LinkedIn accepts them but redirects to a warning page.
- **Bypassing Defenses**: We could bypass these defenses using server- and client-side redirections.

### V. Adversarial Analysis of Link Previews

In this section, we consider an attacker's perspective, aiming to lure users to visit a malicious webpage distributed over social media platforms. The attacker needs to create a benign-looking link preview and avoid URL validation by blacklists.

#### A. Crafting Link Previews
The goal is to create a malicious web page whose preview appears similar to a benign one. We studied the extent to which attackers with different capabilities (control over page content and domain registration) can influence the link preview creation. Table VII summarizes our findings.

| Capability | Control Over Page Content | Domain Registration |
|------------|---------------------------|---------------------|
| **Crafted Fields** | Title, Description, Image, URL | Title, Description, Image, URL |
| **Bypass Techniques** | - | Server- and Client-Side Redirections |

Overall, all platforms are vulnerable to our attacks, except for Plurk and Medium, which we did not test with malicious URLs due to their inability to limit post visibility. Four platforms (Facebook, Xing, Plurk, Slack) can be attacked by those who control the content of a webpage. The remaining platforms are vulnerable to attackers who can also register domain names.

### Summary
- **Vulnerability**: All platforms, except for Plurk and Medium, are vulnerable to crafted link previews.
- **Attackers' Capabilities**: Attackers with control over page content and domain registration can craft arbitrary link previews.
- **Bypass Techniques**: Server- and client-side redirections can bypass existing defenses.

This comprehensive analysis highlights the need for improved security measures on social media platforms to prevent the distribution of malicious content.
