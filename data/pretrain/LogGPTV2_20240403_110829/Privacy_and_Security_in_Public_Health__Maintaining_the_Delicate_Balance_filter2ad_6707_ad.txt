The  public  health  community  recognizes 
the 
awesome responsibility this HIPAA provision carries 
with it to respect and protect the public’s trust.  Not 
only must public health agencies comply with federal 
and state laws and regulations regarding the protection 
of private and confidential information, but the public 
demands  and  expects  that  their  personal  privacy  be 
respected  and 
information  be 
protected.    As  electronic  health  information  flows 
from  laboratories  to  hospitals,  clinics,  and  health 
departments, and from local to state to national health 
agencies,  public  health  is  challenged  to  achieve  and 
maintain  an  optimal  balance  between  protecting  the 
health and safety of the nation’s people, and respecting 
the  privacy  of  individuals.     The  decision  to  use  the 
Internet  as  the  backbone  for  the  PHIN  requires 
security  features  and  architectural  assurances 
to 
counter  inherent  vulnerabilities  not  only  to  protect 
sensitive information against unauthorized disclosure, 
but  also  to  assure  the  integrity  of  data  and  the 
availability of critical services.
