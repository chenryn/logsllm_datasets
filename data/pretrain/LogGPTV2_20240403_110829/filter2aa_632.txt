# Hacking Google AdWords: "Donâ€™t Be Evil, My Ass"

**By: StankDawg**

## What is Google AdWords?
Google AdWords is an advertising program that operates on a pay-per-click (PPC) model. It offers customizable ads and is used across various Google platforms, including:
- Gmail
- Google Groups
- AdSense
- And more

## How Does It Work?
### Initial Setup
- **Initial Deposit:** $20 upfront
  - $5 activation fee
  - $15 credit towards your account

### Payment Model
- **Pay-Per-Click (PPC):**
  - Bidding system with a minimum bid of $0.05
  - You can set a maximum daily budget
  - Higher bids generally lead to better ad placement

### Campaigns and Ad Groups
- **Campaigns:**
  - Logical units for organizing ads
  - Webmasters can create multiple campaigns for different websites

- **Ad Groups:**
  - Multiple ad groups within each campaign
  - Example: For a car dealership, you might have one ad group for new cars and another for used cars

## The Problem
### Reactivation Fees
- **Account Slowing:**
  - Accounts can be slowed without warning
  - Two grace violations result in a $5 reactivation fee

### Terms of Service
- **Prohibited Activities:**
  - No hacking or cracking
  - Google does not differentiate between the two

### Hypocrisy
- **Inconsistent Policies:**
  - While hacking is prohibited, searching "Define:Hacker" on Google provides accurate definitions
  - The keyword tool suggests invalid keywords
  - Competitors like eBay and Amazon can advertise hacking-related content, but individual users cannot
  - Other sites using Google's AdWords engine may not ban "hacker" as strictly as Google does

## What Can You Do?
### Reactivate Your Ads
- **Immediate Reinstatement:**
  - Make a small change to your ads
  - Delete and re-add keywords

### Daily Limits
- **Manipulate Clicks:**
  - Use proxies and scripts to click on competitors' ads
  - Use invalid keywords

## Tricks
### Misspellings
- **Get Early Hits:**
  - Use misspelled keywords to get hits before the correct spelling appears
  - Cheaper at a minimum of $0.05

### Use Proper Names
- **Competitive Keywords:**
  - Use competitor brand names (e.g., use "Pepsi" for a Coke ad)

### General Google Hacking Techniques
- **Exploit Loopholes:**
  - Use common Google hacking techniques
  - Identify and counteract others who are "Google hacking"

## Other Interesting Applications
### Hidden Messages
- **Keyword Limit:**
  - 80-character limit for keywords
  - Can be used to pass hidden messages
  - Public key and secret key for targeted communication

### Misleading People
- **Misinformation:**

### Never Piss Off a Hacker

## Parting Ideas
