In this step, we used published maps from 7 tier-1 and 4
regional providers: CenturyLink, Cox, Deutsche Telekom,
HE, Inteliquent, NTT, Sprint, Tata, TeliaSonera, TWC, XO.
Adding these ISPs resulted in an addition of 6 nodes, 41
links, and 30 conduits (196 nodes, 1153 links, and 347 con-

duits without considering the 9 ISPs above). For example,
for Sprint’s network [60], 102 links were added and for Cen-
turyLink’s network [9], 134 links were added.
2.4 Step 4: Validate the Augmented Map
The fourth and last step of the mapping process is nearly
identical to step 2. In particular, we use public ﬁlings with
state and local governments regarding ROW access, envi-
ronmental impact statements, publicly available IRU agree-
ments and the like to validate locations of links that are in-
ferred in step 3. We also identify which links share the same
ROW. Speciﬁcally with respect to inferring whether con-
duits or ROWs are shared, we are helped by the fact that
the number of possible rights-of-way between the endpoints
of a ﬁber link are limited. As a result, it may be that we sim-
ply need to rule out one or more ROWs in order to establish
sufﬁcient evidence for the path that a ﬁber link follows.
Individual Link Illustration: Many ISPs list only POP-
level connectivity. For such maps, we leverage the corpus of
search terms that we capture in Internet Atlas and search for
public evidence. For example, Sprint’s network [60] is ex-
tracted from the Internet Atlas repository. The map contains
detailed node information, but the geography of long-haul
links is not provided in detail. To infer the conduit informa-
tion, for instance, from Los Angeles, CA to San Francisco,
CA, we start by searching “los angeles to san francisco ﬁber
iru at&t sprint" to obtain an agency ﬁling [13] which shows
that AT&T and Sprint share that particular route, along with
other ISPs like CenturyLink, Level 3 and Verizon. The same
document also shows conduit sharing between CenturyLink
and Verizon at multiple locations like Houston, TX to Dal-
las, TX; Dallas, TX to Houston, TX; Denver, CO to El Paso,
TX; Santa Clara, CA to Salt Lake City, UT; and Wells, NV
to Salt Lake City, UT.
As another example, the IP backbone map of Cox’s net-
work [22] shows that there is a link between Gainesville, FL
and Ocala, FL. But the geography of the ﬁber deployment is
absent (i.e., shown as a simple point with two names in [22]).
We start the search using other ISP names (e.g.,“level 3 and
cox ﬁber iru ocala") and obtain publicly available evidence
(e.g., lease agreement [19]) indicating that Cox uses Level3’s
ﬁber optic lines from Ocala, FL to Gainesville, FL. Next,
we repeat the search with different combinations for other
ISPs (e.g., news article [47] shows that Comcast uses 19,000
miles of ﬁber from Level3; see map at bottom of that page
which highlights the Ocala to Gainesville route, among oth-
ers) and infer that Comcast is also present in that particu-
lar conduit. Given that we know the detailed ﬁber maps of
ISPs (e.g., Level 3) and the inferred conduit information for
other ISPs (e.g., Cox), we systematically infer conduit shar-
ing across ISPs.
Resource Illustration: To illustrate some of the resources
used to validate the locations of Sprint’s network links, pub-
licly available documents reveal that (1) Sprint uses Level
3’s ﬁber in Detroit [61] and their settlement details are pub-
licly available [62], (2) a whitepaper related to a research
network initiative in Virginia identiﬁes link location and
sharing details regarding Sprint ﬁber [27], (3) the “coastal
route” [13] conduit installation project started by Qwest
(now CenturyLink) from Los Angeles, CA to San Francisco,
CA shows that, along with Sprint, ﬁber-optic cables of sev-
eral other ISPs like AT&T, MCI (now Verizon) and Wil-
Tel (now Level 3) were pulled through the portions of the
conduit purchased/leased by those ISPs, and (4) the ﬁber-
optic settlements website [33] has been established to pro-
vide information regarding class action settlements involv-
ing land next to or under railroad rights-of-way where ISPs
like Sprint, Qwest (now CenturyLink), Level 3 and WilTel
(now Level 3) have installed telecommunications facilities,
such as ﬁber-optic cables.
2.5 The US Long-haul Fiber Map
The ﬁnal map constructed through the process described
in this section is shown in Figure 1, and contains 273
nodes/cities, 2411 links, and 542 conduits (with multiple
tenants). Prominent features of the map include (i) dense
deployments (e.g., the northeast and coastal areas), (ii) long-
haul hubs (e.g., Denver and Salt Lake City) (iii) pronounced
absence of infrastructure (e.g., the upper plains and four cor-
ners regions), (iv) parallel deployments (e.g., Kansas City to
Denver) and (v) spurs (e.g., along northern routes).
While mapping efforts like the one described in this sec-
tion invariably raise the question of the quality of the con-
structed map (i.e., completeness), it is safe to state that de-
spite our efforts to sift through hundreds of relevant docu-
ments, the constructed map is not complete. At the same
time, we are conﬁdent that to the extent that the process de-
tailed in this section reveals long-haul infrastructure for the
sources considered, the constructed map is of sufﬁcient qual-
ity for studying issues that do not require local details typ-
ically found in metro-level ﬁber maps. Moreover, as with
other Internet-related mapping efforts (e.g., AS-level maps),
we hope this work will spark a community effort aimed at
gradually improving the overall ﬁdelity of our basic map
by contributing to a growing database of information about
geocoded conduits and their tenants.
The methodological blueprint we give in this section
shows that constructing such a detailed map of the US’s
long-haul ﬁber infrastructure is feasible, and since all data
sources we use are publicly available, the effort is repro-
ducible. The fact that our work can be replicated is not only
important from a scientiﬁc perspective, it suggests that the
same effort can be applied more broadly to construct similar
maps of the long-haul ﬁber infrastructure in other countries
and on other continents.

of very few prior studies that have attempted to conﬁrm or
quantify this assumption [36]. Understanding the relation-
ship between the physical links that make up the Internet
and the physical pathways that form transportation corridors
helps to elucidate the prevalence of conduit sharing by multi-
ple service providers and informs decisions on where future
conduits might be deployed.
Our analysis is performed by comparing the physical link
locations identiﬁed in our constructed map to geocoded in-
formation for both roadways and railways from the United
States National Atlas website [51]. The geographic layout
of our roadway and railway data sets can be seen in Figure 2
and Figure 3, respectively. In comparison, the physical link
geographic information for the networks under considera-
tion can be seen in the Figure 1.
Figure 2: NationalAtlas roadway infrastructure locations.
Interestingly, recommendation 6.4 made by the FCC in
chapter 6 of the National Broadband Plan [7] states that
“the FCC should improve the collection and availability re-
garding the location and availability of poles, ducts, con-
duits, and rights-of-way.”. It also mentions the example of
Germany, where such information is being systematically
mapped. Clearly, such data would obviate the need to ex-
pend signiﬁcant effort to search for and identify the relevant
public records and other documents.
Lastly, it is also important to note that there are commer-
cial (fee-based) services that supply location information for
long-haul and metro ﬁber segments, e.g., [34]. We inves-
tigated these services as part of our study and found that
they typically offer maps of some small number (5–7) of
national ISPs, and that, similar to the map we create (see
map in [41]6), many of these ISPs have substantial overlap
in their locations of ﬁber deployments. Unfortunately, it is
not clear how these services obtain their source information
and/or how reliable these data are. Although it is not pos-
sible to conﬁrm, in the best case these services offer much
of the same information that is available from publicly avail-
able records, albeit in a convenient but non-free form.
3 Geography of Fiber Deployments
In this section, we analyze the constructed map of long-haul
ﬁber-optic infrastructure in the US in terms of its alignment
with existing transportation networks. In particular, we ex-
amine the relationship between the geography of physical
Internet links and road and rail infrastructure.
While the conduits through which the long-haul ﬁber-
optic links that form the physical infrastructure of the In-
ternet are widely assumed to follow a combination of trans-
portation infrastructure locations (i.e., railways and road-
ways) along with public/private right-of-ways, we are aware
6Visually, all the commercially-produced maps agree with
our basic map, hinting at the common use of supporting ev-
idence.
Figure 3: NationalAtlas railway infrastructure locations.
569We use the polygon overlap analysis capability in the Ar-
cGIS [30] to quantify the correspondence between physical
links and transportation infrastructure. In Figure 4, aggre-
gating across all networks under consideration, we compare
the fraction of each path that is co-located with roadways,
railways, or a combination of the two using histogram distri-
butions. These plots show that a signiﬁcant fraction of all the
physical links are co-located with roadway infrastructure.
The plots also show that it is more common for ﬁber con-
duits to run alongside roadways than railways, and an even
higher percentage are co-located with some combination of
roadways and railway infrastructure. Furthermore, for a vast
majority of the paths, we ﬁnd that physical link paths more
often follow roadway infrastructure compared with rail in-
frastructure.
Figure 4: Fraction of physical links co-located with transportation
infrastructure.
Despite the results reported above there remain conduits
in our infrastructure map that are not co-located with trans-
portation ROWs. For example, in the left-hand plot of
Figure 5 we show the Level 3-provided physical link lo-
cations outside Laurel, MS, and in the right-hand plot we
show Google Maps [37] satellite imagery for the same loca-
tion. These images shows the presence of network links,
but no known transportation infrastructure is co-located.
In what follows, we list examples by considering other
types of rights-of-way, such as natural gas and/or petroleum
pipelines, but leave details to future work.

MS. (Left) - Level 3 Provided ﬁber map. (Right) - Google Maps
satellite view.
A few examples can be shown in Level3’s network [48],
where the map shows the existence of link from (1) Ana-
heim, CA to Las Vegas, NV, and (2) Houston, TX to At-
lanta, GA, but no known transportation infrastructure is co-
located. By considering other types of rights-of-way [56],
many of these situations could be explained. Visually, we
can verify that the link from Anaheim, CA to Las Vegas,
NV is co-located with reﬁned-products pipeline. Similarly,
the link from Houston, TX to Atlanta, GA is deployed along
with NGL pipelines.
4 Assessing Shared Risk
In this section, we describe and analyze two notions of risk
associated with sharing ﬁber-optic conduits in the Internet.
At a high level, we consider conduits that are shared by many
service providers as an inherently risky situation since dam-
age to that conduit will affect several providers. Our choice
of such a risk model that considers the degree of link sharing
and not the overall physical topology as a means to analyze
robustness is based on the fact that our map is highly incom-
plete compared to the 40K plus ASes and certain metrics
(e.g., number of ﬁber cuts to partition the US long-haul in-
frastructure) have associated security implications [2]. We
intend to analyze different dimensions of network resilience
in future work.
4.1 Risk Matrix
Our analysis begins by creating a risk matrix based on a
simple counting-based approach. The goal of this matrix is
to capture the level of infrastructure sharing and establish
a measure of shared risk due to lack of diversity in phys-
ical connectivity. The risk matrix is populated as follows:
we start with a tier-1 ISP that has vast infrastructure in the
US and subsequently add other tier-1 and major cable Inter-
net providers to the matrix. The rows are ISPs and columns
are physical conduits carrying long-haul ﬁber-optic links for
those ISPs. Integer entries in the matrix refer to the number
of ISPs that share a particular conduit. As a result, values in
the matrix increase as the level of conduit-sharing increases.
As an illustrative example, we choose Level 3 as a “base”
network due to its very rich connectivity in the US. We use
our constructed physical network map (i.e., the map we de-
scribe in §2) and extract all conduit endpoints across city
pairs, such as “SLC-Denver” (c1 below), SLC-Sacramento
(c2 below), and Sacramento-Palo Alto (c3 below), etc., and
assign 1 for all conduits that are part of Level 3’s physical
network footprint. A partial matrix is then:
Level 3
c1
1
c2
1
c3
1
Next, say we include another provider, e.g., Sprint. We
add a new row for Sprint to the matrix, then for any conduit
used in Sprint’s physical network, we increment all entries
in each corresponding column. For this example, Sprint’s
network shares the SLC-Denver and SLC-Sacramento con-
duits with other providers (including Level 3), but not the
Sacramento-Palo Alto conduit. Thus, the matrix becomes:
Level 3
Sprint
c1
2
2
c2
2
2
c3
1
0
We repeat this process for all the twelve tier-1 and eight
major Internet service providers, i.e., the same ISPs used
as part of constructing our physical map of long-haul ﬁber-
optic infrastructure in the US in §2.
4.2 Risk Metric: Connectivity-only
How many ISPs share a link? Using the risk matrix, we
count the number of ISPs sharing a particular conduit. Fig-
 0 0.5 1 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1Relative FrequencyFraction of paths co-locatedRailRoadRail and Road570ure 6 shows the number of conduits (y axis) for which at least
k ISPs (x axis) share the conduit. For example, there are 542
distinct conduits in our physical map (Figure 1), thus the bar
at x=1 is 542, and 486 conduits are shared by at least 2 ISPs,
thus the bar at x=2 is 486. This plot highlights the fact that
it is relatively uncommon for conduits not to be shared by
more than two providers. Overall, we observe that 89.67%,
63.28% and 53.50% of the conduits are shared by at least
two, three and four major ISPs, respectively.
Figure 6: ISP Ranking.
In some of the more extreme cases, we observe that 12
out of 542 conduits are shared by more than 17 ISPs. These
situations may arise where such conduits run between ma-
jor population centers, or between cities separated by im-
posing geographic constraints (e.g., the Rocky Mountains).
For example, conduits that are shared by 19 ISPs include 1)
Phoenix, AZ to Tucson, AZ, (2) Salt Lake City, UT to Den-
ver, CO, and (3) Philadelphia, PA to New York, NY.
Implication: When it comes to physically deployed connec-
tivity, the US long-haul infrastructure lacks much of the di-
versity that is a hallmark of all the commonly-known mod-
els and maps of the more logical Internet topologies (e.g.,
router- or AS-level graphs [77, 83, 103]).
Which ISPs do the most infrastructure sharing? To better
understand the infrastructural sharing risks to which individ-
ual ISPs are exposed, we leverage the risk matrix and rank
the ISPs based on increasing average shared risk. The aver-
age of the values across a row in the risk matrix (i.e., values
