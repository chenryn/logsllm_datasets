I am filing this issue per @sebmarkbage.
See this bin as an example: http://jsbin.com/zehiqa/1/edit?js,output
@syranide suggested adding an `onChange` to the `` calling
`this.props.toggleSelected`, then adding a `setTimeout` around `setState`
inside `App.toggleSelected`. This approach works but seems unnecessary since
the `` should bubble up to the `` which is handling the event.
