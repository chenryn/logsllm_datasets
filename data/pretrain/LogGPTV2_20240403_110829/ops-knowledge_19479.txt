User: How to ensure that the system will not be paralyzed in the face of DDoS attacks? Please list at least three strategies against DDoS attacks and analyze their advantages and disadvantages.
Assistant: Strategy 1: Traffic cleaning Traffic cleaning is one of the most commonly used methods for defending against DDoS attacks. This method mainly relies on specific hardware devices or cloud platforms to analyze inbound traffic and remove suspicious traffic from normal traffic. The hardware device in it is called hybrid attack intrusion prevention system (Hybrix IPS), which can automatically identify specific attack methods used by attackers, such as SYN Flood, DNS Amplification, etc., and block these traffic or intercept. Advantages: - Traffic cleaning can use various strategies and tools in traffic analysis to filter out harmful malicious traffic in a short period of time and maintain the normal use of services. - Among them, the hybrid IPS can conduct traffic analysis through characteristics such as source/destination IP address, port, protocol, packet size, and IP retention time, thereby improving accuracy. - Since traffic cleaning is cloud-based, attack and intrusion prevention can match global attack patterns in a distributed international network, so that it can filter in the attack range and individual attackers. Disadvantages: - May increase machine overhead. - Prices can be expensive. Strategy 2: Off-site backup An effective measure against DDoS attacks is to deploy infrastructure services in different data centers, switch most data exports from one data center to another, and release data copies to another One data center to prevent overloading of a single data center. Advantages: - The load on a single data center can be reduced. - It can guarantee that the service will not be interrupted when the bandwidth or server is insufficient. - Can prevent DDoS attacks from one specific data center from leaking to other data centers. Disadvantages: - Protocols omitted on routers between Internets create corresponding vulnerabilities. - Data may be subject to security issues during transit. Strategy 3: Increase bandwidth capacity During a DDoS attack, increasing the bandwidth capacity of the system can help IT teams handle a large number of network requests and ensure the normal operation of services. The network add-on business team provides a large amount of bandwidth, which enables enterprises to deploy related applications to a higher bandwidth level. Advantages: - Having more bandwidth available increases the liveness of the service operation. - The network service provided by the partner may also include a system balancing strategy such as an on-demand bandwidth increase function. Disadvantages: - Potentially increased costs as infrastructure services require greater bandwidth capacity. - Increased bandwidth may impact business on-line due to poorly sized missions.
