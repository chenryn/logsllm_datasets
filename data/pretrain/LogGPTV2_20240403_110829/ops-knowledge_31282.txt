User: The website was attacked by DDos, how to strengthen the defense strategy to avoid similar incidents from happening again?
Assistant: 1. Use CDN service: CDN service can disperse traffic and distribute access requests to many servers around the world. Since requests are evenly distributed, it is difficult for an attacker to find a unique target. Similarly, CDN services dynamically adjust data centers to help blogs resist DDoS attacks. 2. Set network restrictions: Setting network restrictions on your own server can prevent a single IP address from generating an excessive number of connections. When the number of visits exceeds a certain threshold, the server will automatically close the visit of the IP address. 3. Use a reverse proxy server: The reverse proxy server can hide the IP address of the real server, so that the attacker cannot obtain the real server location. The reverse proxy server can automatically filter a large number of malicious requests, thereby protecting normal traffic. 4. Strengthen security measures: Enabling WAF and IPS can enhance the protection of the application and network layers to prevent malicious attacks. By setting security policies, specific ports and protocols can also be controlled to ensure network security. 5. Regular backup and disaster recovery: backup copies of data and systems can restore service after an attack. It is recommended to back up data on local storage and other locations such as the cloud to reduce the risk of data loss. 6. Use a proper firewall: A firewall can protect your blog by filtering malicious login attempts and restricting access to less commonly used protocols.
