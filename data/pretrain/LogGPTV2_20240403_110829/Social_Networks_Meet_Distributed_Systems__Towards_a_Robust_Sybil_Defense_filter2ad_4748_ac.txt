gests that our approach adds only a modest network over-
head to the One-Hop overlay, but has a much better net-
work connectivity. Third, MinEC preserves the fast-mixing
property of the honest region’s largest connected component
(LCC) even under heavy churn with only 10% of all honest
nodes being online. This result suggests that existing and
potential future SNSD schemes relying on the fast-mixing
property of the honest region can be applied to the overlay
created by MinEC even under heavy churn. We show the
feasibility of such application by evaluating the robustness
of Gatekeeper [27], a state-of-the-art SNSD scheme, in the
case where only 20% of all honest nodes are online.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We be-
gin with a review of the literature in the ﬁeld in Section 2,
while Section 3 presents the measurement and analysis of
churn in two popular instant messaging systems. Section 4
reformulates the problem addressed by SNSD schemes by
incorporating churn as major challenge. We propose our
approach in Section 5, while Section 6 presents an extensive
evaluation of our approach through simulations. Section 7
summarizes the paper.
2. BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK
2.1 Social Network-based Sybil Defenses
Over the last decade, a large body of work [32, 31, 18, 27,
16, 21, 28] has leveraged social networks to help build robust
and secure distributed systems. One line of work in this ﬁeld
focuses on defending distributed systems against a highly
challenging threat of Sybil attacks [14]. Researchers propose
social network-based Sybil defense (SNSD) schemes [32, 31,
18, 27] that incorporate properties such as the trust relation-
ships among users as well as the resultant graph structure
into their designs to counter such attacks.
Despite varying in approach, most of these schemes make
two fundamental assumptions. First, an adversary can cre-
ate a Sybil region GS comprising a large number of Sybil
identities with trust relationships among themselves. How-
ever, it cannot arbitrarily form trust relationships with hon-
est users (attack edges) because it requires social engineering
eﬀort which is often costly. Second, the honest region GH
comprising only honest users and their relationships is ex-
pander -like and fast-mixing [22] in that a random walk in
GH quickly reaches a stationary distribution.
The ﬁrst assumption implies that the Sybil and honest
regions are connected by only a few attack edges. Based on
the second assumption, SNSD schemes exploit such a sparse
cut between the regions for their robustness. For instance,
the fact that a short random walk starting from a node in
the fast-mixing honest region rarely escapes into the Sybil
region enables SNSD schemes to minimize the inﬂuence of
Sybil nodes on the system utility for honest users.
In this paper, we limit our focus to decentralized SNSD
schemes which can be primarily classiﬁed into (i) Sybil de-
tection schemes that aim to diﬀerentiate honest and Sybil
nodes with a high accuracy, and (ii) Sybil-resilient appli-
cations that tolerate Sybil nodes in their system but not
explicitly identify them.
