In the provided link (http://jsfiddle.net/26mrX/), you can observe several issues after uncommenting the `bootstrap.css` injection. These include, but are not limited to:

- The marker icon appears distorted when set as draggable (`draggable: true`).
- The map's zoom controls are incorrectly displayed and occasionally disappear.
- There are numerous other problems that have also been identified.

It is surprising to see such fundamental issues, and it is disappointing that they have not been resolved.

I've rephrased the text to be more professional and clear, while still conveying the frustration with the issues.
