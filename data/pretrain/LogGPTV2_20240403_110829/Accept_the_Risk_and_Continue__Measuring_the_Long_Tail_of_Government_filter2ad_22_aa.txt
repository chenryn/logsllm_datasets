ABSTRACT
Across the world, government websites are expected to be reliable
sources of information, regardless of their view count. Interactions
with these websites often contain sensitive information, such as
identity, medical, or legal data, whose integrity must be protected
for citizens to remain safe. To better understand the government
website ecosystem, we measure the adoption of https including
the “long tail” of government websites around the world, which
are typically not captured in the top-million datasets used for such
studies. We identify and measure major categories and frequencies
of https adoption errors, including misconfiguration of certificates
via expiration, reuse of keys and serial numbers between unrelated
government departments, use of insecure cryptographic protocols
and keys, and untrustworthy root Certificate Authorities (CAs).
Finally, we observe an overall lower https rate and a steeper dropoff
with descending popularity among government sites compared to
the commercial websites & provide recommendations to improve
the usage of https in governments worldwide.

1 INTRODUCTION
Today, most secure web communication takes place over HyperText
Transfer Protocol Secure (https). Using Transport Layer Security
(TLS) to encrypt http requests and responses, https provides users
with message authentication, integrity and confidentiality. Many
elements of https usage have been explored, with previous work
focused on measuring the cost of https [59], analyzing the cer-
tificate ecosystem [25], and more recently, examination of https
adoption in the web of 2017 [31].
While the most recent measurements by Felt et al. [31] focused
on adoption of https using the Alexa top 1 Million dataset, many
critical web resources are unlikely to fall within this dataset, such
as websites run by local and national governments. Such sites, often
serving smaller geographic regions or countries without a large
web presence, are trusted with holding sensitive user data for civic
functions or providing information such as local infectious disease
numbers. Prior case studies have shown that citizens visit local
county government websites for a wide range of services including
job openings, local demographics, budgets, meeting minutes, details
of contracts and their summaries, and for official contact informa-
tion of their elected representatives [10]. Research also shows that
websites providing quality e-services help build trusted relation-
ships between citizens and their governments; further, low-traffic
local government websites such as utilities, water etc., while not
present in top million lists, are still actively used in citizens’ daily
lives [76]. Attackers therefore may target government sites to dis-
rupt critical infrastructure, steal identifying data, disenfranchise
citizens and influence politics, or decrease their trust in the gov-
ernment. Providing secure access to local “.gov” sites should be of
high priority for governments.
Despite the high importance of government websites’ integrity,
we find that greater than 70% of the total government websites
measured worldwide (in a scan of 135,408 of which only 12,293
(9.07%) are in standard top millions lists), do not use valid https. Of
the 53,256 (39.33%) websites that attempt to support https, 15,223
(28.58%) are invalid with a large variety of certificate errors. We
identify major categories and frequencies of these errors, including
∼5.50% expired certificates, ∼13% use of insecure cryptographic
protocols, ∼15% use of self signed certificates either at the leaf level
or in the cert chain, and 1,390 instances of public key reuse between
unrelated governments. Including the websites that implement
https correctly but do not enforce upgrades to https, this number
rises to 19,349 (36.33%).

Singanamalla et al.
We make the following contributions: (1) perform a large-scale
study of https adoption of global government websites including
outside of the “top millions”; (2) identify trends in type of hosting,
cryptographic key usage, CAs, and corresponding https validity;
(3) perform in-depth case studies on two countries, the United
States of America (USA) and South Korea (ROK), selected for the
existence of authoritative government hostname lists, and compare
them; (4) responsibly disclose these weaknesses, and measure our
influence on https validity; (5) discuss the limitations of our mea-
surements, and (6) conclude with recommendations to stakeholders
to encourage & improve https adoption.
2 RELATED WORK
2.1 Datasets & Tools
Datasets of websites exist on the Internet for research use, includ-
ing the Alexa million datasets which rank sites by popularity, the
Cisco million [16] which ranks by traffic volume, and the Majestic
million [42]–an open source version of the Alexa million since its
acquisition by Amazon. Tranco, another public list, attempts to
provide a more stable ranking for web measurement avoiding the
flux of prior datasets [49]. Le Pochat et. al. note that only 49% of the
domains in the Umbrella datasets are available, responding with
a success status code of 200, as are only 89% of the Majestic mil-
lion [49]. Our work uses these datasets as a seed set, which we then
expand through web crawling, Amazon Mechanical Turk tasks,
and hand-searching domains to increase the number of unique
measurable government websites from 27,532 to 135,408. This is a
substantial increase from government websites in existing datasets,
and forms the basis for our analysis. In prior work, tools like ZMap
and CFSSL have enabled researchers to perform large scale studies
on Internet hosts [19, 22]. Services like Censys constantly monitor
the Internet for https adoption in addition to detecting vulnerabil-
ities like heartbleed [23].
2.2 https Measurements
The closest and most recent work to our analysis is by Felt et al. on
measuring adoption of https across the web [31]. Google, in their
report indicated a modification to their search algorithm to boost
sites using https [11]. Our analysis is different in that prior efforts
largely focus on the “head” of the Internet, i.e. popular domains
as found in top million lists. However, in this paper, we explicitly
include the “long tail” of government websites as they are especially
critical to users’ safety but do not commonly appear in the top
million lists. Mirian et al. similarly measured https among general
sites outside the top millions, finding that services providing free
certificates such as Let’s Encrypt improve overall adoption of https
and that general web domains also use Let’s Encrypt four times
more than other CA authorities [55]. We show that Let’s Encrypt
is also the most popular CA used by government sites globally,
though not in every country.
Prior studies have tried to understand the root causes of https
certificate errors in Chrome [5] and analyze trust models in CAs [6,
29]. Others focus on challenges in the certificate ecosystem, the
need to make them more auditable, and ways that CAs could be
incentivized using insurance models with benefits negotiated be-
tween CAs and domains [24, 25, 38, 52, 64].
Certificate Transparency (CT) is one such effort to make issuance
more auditable by continuously recording SSL/TLS certificates on
an append-only database [48, 70]. Previous studies used CT logs
to detect phishing domains which were issued certificates, and
phishing attackers using a honeypot [70]. Another study in 2016
measured worldwide adoption of Let’s Encrypt-issued certificates,
which are automatically published to CT logs [80], and noticed
that adoption was higher in countries with high Internet penetra-
tion [51]. While CT provides the largest view of certificates on the
Internet, it misses around 10% in the .com, .net and, .org zones [80].
There is no existing measurement of the number of government
domain certificates missing from CT logs.
2.3 Usable Security
Multiple studies have shown users’ proclivity to ignore warning
messages displayed by browsers when interacting with websites
on the Internet [47, 73]. Studies of webmasters have shown that
they often unknowingly misconfigure SSL/TLS certificates on web
servers, but are split on the importance of https and sometimes
even misconfigure certificates on purpose [30]. Many end-users
misinterpret https on websites as indicators of a secure site [68].
Understanding TLS errors, communicating the dangers of non-
https websites, and understanding challenges in https adoption
have been studied [6, 17, 30, 46]. Given our result that government
websites have different (and worse) https adoption properties than
commercial websites, studies focused on government webmasters
could be an interesting future direction.
3 HTTPS BACKGROUND
3.1 HTTPS, Certificates and the Web
https is an encrypted data transfer protocol between a web browser
client and a web server providing a secure version of the older http
protocol. https uses Transport Layer Security (TLS), a successor to
the now deprecated Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol, to establish
secure communication using asymmetric key cryptography. A TLS
handshake starts the process of establishing a secure connection
to a website. The handshake begins with the client and server
negotiating the TLS version and cipher suite to use. The client
validates the certificate provided by the server, then generates a
premaster secret which is encrypted with the server’s public key.
This is used to establish a shared session key, enabling an encrypted
communication channel [18].
TLS/SSL certificates are specific files hosted by web servers con-
taining the domain hosts’ public key along with identity informa-
tion, such as the domain name they wish to use and the name of the
organization. These certificates are (per best practice) cryptograph-
ically signed (attested) and issued for a fixed duration by a trusted
certificate authority (CAs). CAs previously voted to limit certificate
lifetimes to 825 days [13], and recently further reduced lifetimes
to one year starting September 2020 [14, 33]. However, it is also
possible to create a self-signed certificate which is cryptographically
valid but not attested by a CA, thus limiting the privacy benefits.
If configured correctly, https allows communication to remain
confidential and non-tamperable, providing an authenticated medium
between client and server with the assurance that communications
are only being received and read by the intended recipient. Popular

projects like Let’s Encrypt, a US non-profit, have made it possi-
ble for website operators to add https support for absolutely no
fee [4]. Cloud providers like Azure, Google Cloud, along with Con-
tent Delivery Network (CDN) providers like Cloudflare and Akamai,
have similarly made it easy to integrate https by intercepting and
handling the requests [26] in a secure, easy to configure manner.
http, without https, enables man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks
wherein the adversary can eavesdrop, secretly alter, and relay com-
munications between two parties, sending its communication en-
tirely in plaintext. Expert attackers, malicious governments, or
Internet Service Providers could proxy requests and show modified
content to the user, steal their information, or use it for surveil-
lance. Such attacks have been thoroughly studied and publicly doc-
umented by cybersecurity companies [2] and organizations such as
the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) [20]. The lack
of a matching root certificate during validation of a certificate chain
results in an error indicating undetected local issuer certificate [63].
3.2 Certificate Authorities
Certificate Authorities (CAs) are trusted third parties whose core
responsibility is to issue SSL/TLS certificates. CAs and their cer-
tificates are treated as trust anchors and shipped by default by
software providers (usually with browsers or operating systems)
such as Microsoft, Google, Apple, and Mozilla [9, 54, 57]. The list
of default trusted root CAs can differ between browsers and tools.
Our analysis of the trust stores show that Apple includes 174 de-
fault root trusted certificates, while Microsoft [54] includes 402
default root certificates. The Mozilla NSS [57] trusted certificate
store consists of 152 default root trusted certificates. NSS trusts 52
individual root CA owners, while Microsoft and Apple trust 133
and 69 root CA owners respectively. Any valid intermediate CA
must be authorized as a CA. Therefore, a weak CA in a certificate’s
chain of trust is a weak link in a website’s security, exemplified by
the compromises of DigiNotar and Comodo [7, 8].
A certificate issued by a CA binds the public key of the web host
to the domain name and is cryptographically established by the CA
signing the contents with its private key. A CA responds to a re-
quest to issue a certificate by challenging the domain host to prove
its ownership. Such Domain Validated (DV) certificates are the most
common type. CA-issued certificates can also include information
such as organization names, postal address, or an administrator
email address. These Extended Validated (EV) certificates are rig-
orously validated by the CA before issuance and are intended to
make phishing attacks with valid certificates harder.
EV certificates (limited to a 2 year validity [34]) were previously
treated in a special manner by most browsers, e.g. by displaying
the name of the business entity along with the green lock symbol
indicating availability of https [74]. However, it was still possible
for a malicious attacker to register a company with the same name
in a different physical address and request an EV certificate. EV
certificates are generally expensive, with a fee for issuance. They
have been widely adopted by large Internet companies, payment
gateways, and banks providing online services. However, their
popularity has reduced due to concerns about their effectiveness
and the move by major browsers to avoid distinguishing visually
between EV and DV certificates in the interface [74].
4 METHODOLOGY
4.1 Seed Dataset
Throughout the work, we use the term “hostname” to refer to
the full subdomain+domain strings identifying unique websites
(e.g. “blog.example.com” with subdomain “blog” and domain “exam-
ple.com”), rather than URL strings which may include subdirecto-
ries. We also define website or hostname “availability” as successful
resolution of the DNS query and a 200 code in response to a web
request to load page content.
We begin by generating an initial “seed” list of government
hostnames by merging the publicly available top-million datasets
mentioned in section 2.1, including the Majestic Million dataset,
Cisco top 1 Million dataset, one historical copy of the Alexa top 1
Million dataset published in August 2019, and the Censys research
dataset produced by the University of Michigan and made available
through Google BigQuery [23, 69]. This merged dataset of host-
names is then filtered and de-duplicated to include only government
websites through the method described in 4.1.1.
As of August 2019, this yielded a seed list of 27,532 unique gov-
ernment hostnames. An initial query using the Majestic Million
dataset indicated that nih.gov is the highest-ranked government
hostname (51st), and ncb.gov.sg is the lowest (999,825th). The
top government website that does not have an TLS/SSL certificate,
ranked at 222, is miit.gov.cn and belongs to the Ministry for
Industry and IT of the People’s Republic of China.
4.1.1 Government Hostname Filtering. We separate government
and non-government sites through a regular expression filter for
hostnames using standard government formats. A popular format
used by many countries is .gov.country-code, and all countries except
the United States use only one domain extension. However, the
USA uses both .gov.us and .gov for official government purposes,
in addition to a dedicated federal .fed/.fed.us and military .mil top
level domain (TLD) without the “us” country code.
Government domain names and extensions depend heavily on
countries’ primary languages. Countries with French as a primary
language often use .gouv, and those with Spanish use .gob followed
by country code. Kenya, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Thailand and
Uganda use .go followed by the country code. Some countries use
.gub, .govern, .government, and .guv, New Zealand uses .govt and
