Abstract. This paper presents the Clarified system for passive network analy-
sis. It is based on capturing complete packet history and abstracting it in form of 
different  interactive  high-level  visual  presentations.  They  allow  for  drilling 
from the high-level abstractions all the way down to individual packets and vice 
versa. The applicability of the system is demonstrated with the daily  manage-
ment of a large municipal wireless network. 
Keywords: Iterative interactive network traffic visualization. 
1   Introduction 
We present the Clarified Recorder and Analyzer system for passive network analysis. 
It is a further developed and commercialized version of the freely available HowNet-
Works tool that won the first price in VMware Ultimate Virtual Appliance Challenge 
in 2006 [5]. The system is based on capturing complete packet history, which is ab-
stracted by various visual presentations. They represent different aspects of the packet 
data, for example individual events, identities, flows between identities, or causal rela-
tionships  of  flows.  The  visualizations  facilitate  visual  drilling  down  from  high-level 
visual  abstractions  to  the  level  of  individual  packets  and  back.  This  facilitates  high-
level visual analysis of complicated network problems without tedious and time con-
suming detailed study of large amounts of packet data. Further, the availability of the 
captured packet data allows reactive assessment of security threats based on real traffic 
in the network. We describe the design and implementation of the proposed system and 
report its usage in the daily management of a large municipal wireless network.

Clarified Recorder and Analyzer for Visual Drill Down Network Analysis

Analyzer  for  iterative  visual  drill  drown  analysis.  The  Recorder  uses  an  approach 
similar  to  the  Time  Machine  [1],  so  that  data  collection  agents  (taps)  are  placed 
throughout  the  network.   The  Recorder  collects  packets  from  one  or  multiple  taps, 
possibly filters the packet stream with a set of predefined filters, and stores the pack-
ets into multiple pcap files in a ring buffer fashion, together with a flow index com-
puted  on  the  fly  [4].  The  Recorder  is  able  to  simultaneously  record  and  export  the 
captured  data  to  the  Analyzer.  The  main  design  goals  for  the  Recorder  have  been 
protocol independence and capturing of complete network traffic. The software com-
ponents  can  be  deployed  on  a  standard  off-the-shelf  PC.  The  hardware  dictates  the 
scalability of the Recorder in terms of the effective packet rate that can be recorded 
without packet loss. The performance of the tap implemented in native C is limited by 
libpcap  and  the  speed  of  the  disk.   With  a  high-performance  RAID5  array  and  an 
optimized version of libpcap [6] multiple Gigabit Ethernet streams can be stored to 
disk without loss of data. The current bottleneck in the Recorder is the indexer written 
in Python, which is able to process about 40000 pps (~250 Mbps) on a high-end quad-
core 2.6 GHz Xeon machine.

The Analyzer imports a track (i.e. a flow index) created by a Recorder. The track is 
represented  and  manipulated  on  a  timeline,  which  allows  ‘time  travel’  within  the 
track. The Analyzer can conduct real-time analysis by importing a ‘live’ track that is 
currently being recorded by a Recorder. The Analyzer illustrates causal relationships 
[4]  between  different  events  in  the  track  and  other  aspects  with  different  types  of 
visualizations,  including  connection  graph  (flows  between  identities),  layer  graph 
(relationships between entities), association graph (combination of connection graph 
and layer graph),  topology  view (flows rendered on a network diagram),  earth  view 
(data on a world map) and DNS timeline (TTL values of DNS resource records). The 
so-called  monitors  provide  basic  textual  views  of  the  packet  data,  including  flow 
monitor (flows), identity monitor (identities) and port monitor (port statistics). 
The main design goal for the Analyzer has been high-level analysis using ‘living 
views’. It refers to the functional relationship between the visualizations provided by 
the Analyzer and the underlying packet data or network documentation. For example, 
124

given a particular visualization the user can access the corresponding packet data in 
real  time,  which  allows  for  drilling  down  from  a  high-level  overview  down  to  the 
underlying flows and the details of individual packets if needed be. Similarly, visuali-
zations can be mapped to network documentation so that the flows contained in the 
packet data are rendered on the network diagram, allowing visual inspection and un-
derstanding  of  the  network  traffic.  Further,  visualizations  can  be  used  to  filter  the 
input data, filtering affecting other views as well. For example, the earth view can be 
used for painting the geographical region of interest, on which further analysis will be 
limited.  The  packet  data  of  interest  can  also  be  exported  to  3rd  party  tools  in  pcap 
format.  The  AAA  capabilities  include  centralized  cookie-based  user  authentication, 
track-specific authorization, and accounting of Analyzer use and Recorder logins. The 
Analyzer is implemented in Python. 
3   Usage in a Daily Management of a Municipal Wireless Network 
panOULU is a municipal wireless network in the City of Oulu in northern Finland [3]. 
As of now the panOULU network has about 1050 WiFi APs, which provide open (no 
login, authentication or registration) and free (no payment) wireless internet access to 
the general public with a WiFi-equipped device. panOULU network has been opera-
tional since October 2003. The network usage has been growing constantly so that in 
September  2008  15127  unique  WiFi  devices  used  the  panOULU  network,  totaling 
~370000  sessions  and  ~13.9  million  minutes  of  online  time.  For  a  comprehensive 
description of the panOULU network see [2]. 
The  Recorder  and  Analyzer  have  been  used  in  the  daily  management  of  the 
panOULU  network  since  2006.  Three  Recorder  instances  are  deployed  on  a  Dell 
PowerEdge 2900  with 4 CPUs and 8 GB of  RAM. The  machine has 3 TB of local 
disk,  of  which  2  TB  is  reserved  for  storing  packet  data.  One  Recorder  instance  is 
recording outside the NAT router, and two instances inside the NAT router. Capturing 
packets on both sides of the NAT allows inspecting possible NAT traversal problems, 
and  deploying  multiple  Recorder  instances  with  different  filter  configurations  pro-
vides  better  scalability.  Each  instance  is  configured  to  record  the  first  100  bytes  of 
each packet for the purpose of avoiding recording of private data possibly contained 
in the payloads. Since the average traffic is ~20000 pps, the 2 TB of disk is sufficient 
for recording ~11.5 days of traffic. So far peak rates have been ~71000 pps, which the 
multiple Recorder deployment has been able to capture without any packet loss. 
The ‘time travel’ functionality is one of the main benefits of the Clarified system in 
the  daily  network  management.  If  and  when  something  abnormal  happens,  we  can 
always  easily  return  to  the  incident,  as  long  as  the  data  is  still  available  on  disk.  A 
typical case is a rogue IPv6 router. Windows Vista operating system has an interest-
ing ‘feature’: if a Vista machine is configured to use IPv6 routing (which is the de-
fault)  and  Internet  connection  sharing  is  enabled,  the  machine  starts  sending  faulty 
IPv6 router advertisements, which mess up IPv6 routing in the network. As Vista is 
becoming  more  popular,  so  are  rogue  IPv6  routers  in  the  panOULU  network.  To 
counter  the  problem  we  have  implemented  RogueIPv6Alerter  as  a  Recorder  helper 
application.  Upon  detecting  a  faulty  IPv6  router  advertisement  it  creates  an  alert 
bookmark identifying the event on the timeline. If we are able to locate the machine,

we inform the user of the problem. If not, the machine is disconnected and placed on 
the list of blocked machines. The next time the machine tries to connect to the net-
work it is automatically redirected to a web page explaining the problem and provid-
ing instructions for fixing the problem. Another typical case is an infected machine. 
We monitor the traffic for patterns involving large amounts of ARP traffic, which is 
typical  for  viruses.  If  and  when  such  patterns  are  detected,  we  engage  Analyzer  to 
identify the infected machine for corrective action as with rogue IPv6 routers. 
4   Conclusion 
We presented the Clarified Recorder and Analyzer for visual drill down of  network 
problems  using  different  interactive  visual  abstractions  of  the  captured  packet  data. 
By capturing complete packet history we guarantee that we can always drill down to 
individual  packets  when  necessary.  If  we  would  sample  the  packet  stream,  there 
would be no chance to obtain the original flow information later. However, the trade-
off is that the system does not scale up for high speed core networks. We are currently 
expanding the system towards wiki-based collaborative analysis.
