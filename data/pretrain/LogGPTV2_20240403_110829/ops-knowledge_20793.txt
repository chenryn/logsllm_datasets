User: I have dutifully uninstalled all the Python packages I installed with sudo pip install and installed them with pip --user install instead. Yay me :)
On Ubuntu, I know I can find the relevant binaries at /home/<USERNAME>/.local/bin and the packages themselves at /home/<USERNAME>/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages ... but navigating there is not as simple as good old pip freeze.
How can I pip freeze and get only the packages I installed with pip --user install rather than all the Python packages, including those installed via apt?
Assistant: It's fairly easy in recent versions of pip (the PR in the other answer is now part of pip).
pip freeze --user
This will output a list of packages currently installed to the user's site-packages.
