Dropbox enables people to sync ﬁles and media across platforms and devices, in order to 
have them available from any location.
The service also allows people to easily and quickly share ﬁles with others. 
Dropbox provides users with 2 GB of space for free, and they can pay for more.
http://techcrunch.com/2011/04/17/dropbox-hits-25-millions-users-200-million-ﬁles-per-day
People use Dropbox for personal storage, ﬁle syncing between machines, and group 
collaboration on projects. 
They have desktop software for the usual OSs (Mac OSX, Linux and Windows) and mobile 
access, that makes things run smoothly.

2009 2 millions users

2011 April - Dropbox claims to have 25 million users of its free service
http://techcrunch.com/2011/04/17/dropbox-hits-25-millions-users-200-million-ﬁles-per-day
“Today, Dropbox has 25 million users and 200 million ﬁles are “saved” daily, and 
more than 1 million every ﬁve minutes.”

So, a for-proﬁt company offer a free app, with free data 
storage... so, what’s to worry about?
We know Dropbox is secure because Dropbox says so:
■ “Your ﬁles are always available from the secure Dropbox website”  (secure sounds good)
■ “All transmission of ﬁle data occurs over an encrypted channel (SSL)”  (wow, that sounds good too!)
■ “All ﬁles stored on Dropbox are encrypted (AES-256)”  (dude, that's “military grade” encryption! That's 
gotta be good!)
■ “...protects your ﬁles without you needing to think about it” (How can you argue with that?)
■ “Your stuff is safe”  (O’RLY?)

However, security researchers have turned up evidence otherwise.
How Dropbox sacriﬁces user privacy for cost savings
“While the decision to deduplicate data has probably saved the company quite a bit of 
storage space and bandwidth, it has signiﬁcant ﬂaws which are particularly troubling given 
the statements made by the company on its security and privacy page.” Christopher Soghoian
(ﬁles hashes are checked before upload, bandwidth testing shows that ﬁles aren’t transferred if 
they exist (elsewhere) on the servers)

http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/05/dropbox-ftc
Dropbox Lied to Users About Data Security, Complaint to FTC Alleges
Christopher Soghoian published data last month showing that Dropbox could indeed see 
the contents of ﬁles, putting users at risk of government searches, rogue Dropbox 
employees, and even companies trying to bring mass copyright-infringement suits.
Soghoian, who spent a year working at the FTC, charges [... ] “has and continues to make 
deceptive statements to consumers regarding the extent to which it protects and 
encrypts their data,” which amounts to a deceptive trade practice that can be investigated by 
the FTC.
Dropbox authentication: insecure by design
“Here’s the problem: the conﬁg.db ﬁle is completely portable and is *not* tied to 
the system in any way.  This means that if you gain access to a person’s conﬁg.db ﬁle (or  just 
the  host_id), you gain complete access to the person’s Dropbox until such time that the person 
removes the host from the list of linked devices via the Dropbox web interface.” Derek Newton
http://dereknewton.com/2011/04/dropbox-authentication-static-host-ids
Dropbox: A Privacy Black Box
”National Security Letter authority and the impoverished “third party doctrine” in 
Fourth Amendment law puts cloud-user privacy on pretty weak footing. 
Dropbox’s policies do nothing to shore that up. It’s not alone, of course. It’s just a 
nice discrete example of how “the cloud” exposes your data to risks that local storage doesn’t.” 
Jim Harper

Ok, so Dropbox has *some* security and privacy 
issues, at least it’s safe and secure now...right?
Dropbox Security Bug Made Passwords Optional For Four Hours
“This morning a post on Pastebin outlined a serious security issue that was spotted at 
Dropbox: for a brief period of time, the service allowed users to log into 
accounts using any password. In other words, you could log into someone’s account 
simply by typing in their email address. Given that many people entrust Dropbox with secure 
data (one of the service’s selling points is its security), that’s a big deal.
http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/dropbox-security-bug-made-passwords-optional-for-four-hours/2011/06/20/AGupXTdH_story.html
Dropbox conﬁrms security glitch -- no password required
”Web-based storage ﬁrm Dropbox conﬁrmed this afternoon that a programmer's error caused 
a temporary security breach that allowed any password to be used to access any user account.
The San Francisco-based start-up attributed the security breach to a "code update" 
that "introduced a bug affecting our authentication mechanism." Access without 
passwords was possible between 1:54pm PT and 5:46pm PT yesterday, the company said.”

Ok, so maybe Dropbox knows what you have, and might not be more 
secure than the next cloud service provider, at least it has security to 
protect information about your personal data usage...right?

Dropbox Reader™
Dropbox Reader is actually a series of six command line Python scripts which parse the 
conﬁguration and cache ﬁles of a Dropbox account, including the user's registered e-mail 
address, dropbox identiﬁer, software version info and list of recently changed ﬁles 
stored in conﬁg.db, the information about shared directories and ﬁles marked for 
sync stored in ﬁlecache.db. [the] Python scripts operate on SQLite3 Dropbox database ﬁles.

backup your stuff and share with others, huh? Great, that's just what everybody 
needs, right?” Ceiling Cat

Knowing what I know about open source, I know we can do 
better, and it won't cost us our privacy or security
Start simple: what can sync ﬁles to remote systems?
http://rsync.samba.org 
http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison
What can we use as a trigger to kick off a sync?
inotify
it watches for notices from the Linux kernel (since 2.6)
Jun 21 20:57:32 rogue Dropbox[1448]: Unable to monitor entire Dropbox 
folder hierarchy. Please run "echo 100000 | sudo tee /proc/sys/fs/
inotify/max_user_watches" and restart Dropbox to correct the problem.
https://code.google.com/p/lsyncd/
And how to securely transfer data? (no-brainer)
http://www.openssh.com
Start with a simple script that would...
■ use lsyncd to monitor a directory
■ when it senses a change (read, write, delete) have it kick off unison or rsync to sync with a 
remote server over SSH
■ have cron run a script on the client to periodically check with the server for new ﬁles from 
other clients
■ add more features later, once this was a working proof of concept and vetted by the 
community as being 'a good idea'

"Building an Open Source 
Dropbox Clone"
Hacker Monthly 
December 2010:34-36
http://hackermonthly.com/issue-7.html
Now I had...
■ freely shared my idea with 'teh internets'
■ generated lots of productive conversation and feedback on my idea
■ showed there is interest in an open source, free option to ﬁll the roll that 
proprietary software like Dropbox does today
And so... it was time to build a project around my idea.
http://www.myfacewhen.net
How would this be successful?
■ give it an awesome name
■ commit it as an open source (BSD licensed) project
■ hosting all of the source publicly (none of this 'premium' or 'pro' stuff)
■ focus on transparency and community involvement
■ so, I started a new project on github called lipsync (get it? see? ya?)
■ https://github.com/philcryer/lipsync/
https://github.com/philcryer/lipsync
https://github.com/philcryer/lipsync/raw/master/docs/diagram.png
• show canned demo video
■ multiple terminals and ﬁle managers can be seen at once for visual impact
■ put a ﬁle in one, watch the logs scroll and watch the ﬁle appear on the other nodes
■ quickly demonstrate installing it on another node (speed up the 'ﬁlm')
■ show that new node being part of the mix, with all the ﬁles intact after the install
■ add a ﬁle to this new node, watch it show up on the others
■ crowd cheers, I raise my arms in a 'V' formation and stage dive into the audience
Text
Demo
Currently
■ lsyncd2 daemon to handle the watching for ﬁle changes via inotify
■ kicks off rsync over ssh to securely sync the data
■ a contributor has lsyncd2 running on OSX (cross platform phase one)
■ preliminary ideas of how a win32 version 'could work' with the installer running 
under cgywin
■ great response from the community, user’s forking the project, submitting patches 
and contributing to an active mailing list
Future echos
■ make it truly cross platform
■ Linux, Mac, Windows, Android, iOS, etc
■ one installer to rule them all!
■ make it more secure/private/etc
■ encrypted ﬁlesystems, p2p?
■ more ideas from the community
http://lipsync.it/
Conclusion
■ it’s possible to create a secure, ﬁle distribution app that protects user’s privacy and security…
■ but it won't be built by any for-proﬁt, third party; it will be built by us 
■ and we should look at other cloud offerings with this same skepticism
■ get involved, try out and use lipsync, fork it, join the mailing list, submit an issue
■ contribute your ideas, make changes, think about how it can be better
■ always bring a towel!
■ and remember...
