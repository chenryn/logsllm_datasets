To create a setup where:
  * There are multiple worker processes on different servers.
  * Using multiple threads in each worker process.
Then one currently needs to jump through some hoops to setup the
`JULIA_NUM_THREADS` environment variable for each worker process. Thus one
can't use a simple `addprocs` with something like `SshClusterManater`. A
possible workaround is writing a shell script which sets the environment
variable and launches `julia` and specify this as the Julia executable.
It would be much more convenient and natural if `julia` provided a command
line option for specifying the number of threads. If such a command line
option is explicitly specified, it should override the value of
`JULIA_NUM_THREADS`, if any.
This setup is useful because the threads within each worker process
automatically share "everything" without having to resort to constructs like
`SharedArray`. Of course this also means one needs to be more careful.
