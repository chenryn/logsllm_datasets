User: How to deploy a container-based application on a k8s cluster?
Assistant: Deploying a container-based application on a k8s cluster can follow the following steps: 1. Create a Docker image that contains the application and its dependencies. 2. Create a Kubernetes deployment and deploy our image. A Deployment controls how many replicas of pods need to run and ensures that pods on nodes are always available when needed. 3. Create a Kubernetes service to expose our deployment. A Service defines a set of pods within a cluster and assigns virtual IP addresses (ClusterIP) and ports to allow other applications to access them. 4. You can use Ingress or LoadBalancer (cloud provider) to expose the service to the outside, and obtain the public IP address and DNS name. It is important to note that Kubernetes objects can be created using configuration files or command-line based tools such as kubectl. I'll provide more examples and command lines below. The following is an example of creating a simple Node.js application: 1. Dockerfile example: ``` FROM node:14-alpine WORKDIR /app COPY package*.json ./ RUN npm install COPY . . EXPOSE 3000 CMD ["npm" , "start"] ``` 2. Kubernetes deployment file example (the file name is `app-deployment.yaml`): ``` apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: app-deployment spec: replicas: 3 selector: matchLabels: app: node-app template: metadata: labels: app: node-app spec: containers: - name: node-app image: your-docker-repo/node-app:v1 ports: - containerPort: 3000 readinessProbe : httpGet: path: / port: 3000 livenessProbe: httpGet: path: / port: 3000 ``` 3. Kubernetes service file example (the file name is `app-service.yaml`): ``` apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata: name: app-service spec: selector: app: node-app ports: - name: http protocol: TCP port: 80 targetPort: 3000 type: ClusterIP ``` Before completing the above deployment, make sure that kubectl has been installed (refer to [ Install the documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)) and connect to the k8s cluster. Deployment can be done with: ``` kubectl apply -f app-deployment.yaml kubectl apply -f app-service.yaml ``` Finally, the status of the deployment can be checked with: ``` kubectl get deployment,pod, service kubectl describe service app-service ``` If all goes well, you can visit the virtual IP address and port of the service in the browser, and you can see the output of the application.
