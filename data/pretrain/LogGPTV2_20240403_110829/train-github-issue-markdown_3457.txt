### Issue Type:
Bug Report

### Ansible Version:
- **Version**: 2.0.0.2
- **Configuration File**: Not specified
- **Module Search Path**: Default (no overrides)

### Ansible Configuration:
- No specific configurations applied.

### Environment:
- **Local Machine**: macOS 10.11.2, Ansible installed via Homebrew.
- **Target Machine**: Up-to-date Debian Wheezy.

### Summary:
The issue appears to be that the `become` feature (which uses the default `sudo` adapter) cannot be used without providing a sudo password, even when the target machine is configured to allow sudo without a password.

### Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run the following command:
   ```sh
   ansible foo -a "whoami" -b
   ```
2. Alternatively, run:
   ```sh
   ansible foo -a "whoami" -s
   ```

### Expected Results:
```plaintext
foo | SUCCESS | rc=0 >>
root
```

### Actual Results:
```plaintext
foo | FAILED | rc=0 >>
ERROR! Missing sudo password
```

### Additional Information:
- Sudo without a password is correctly configured on the target machine.
- The same setup works as expected with Ansible 1.9.
