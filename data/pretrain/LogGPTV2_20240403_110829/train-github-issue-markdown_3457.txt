##### Issue Type:
Bug Report
##### Ansible Version:
ansible 2.0.0.2  
config file =  
configured module search path = Default w/o overrides
##### Ansible Configuration:
Nothing particular
##### Environment:
Running from OSX 10.11.2, ansible installed via homebrew  
Target OS, up to date debian wheezy
##### Summary:
It seems that we can't use become (default sudo adapter) without defining a
sudo password.
##### Steps To Reproduce:
Just run
    ansible foo -a "whoami" -b
Or
    ansible foo -a "whoami" -s
##### Expected Results:
    foo | SUCCESS | rc=0 >>
    root
##### Actual Results:
    foo | FAILED | rc=0 >>
    ERROR! Missing sudo password
Of course, sudo without password is well configured on the target machine, and
everything is ok with ansible 1.9
