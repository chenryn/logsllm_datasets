The full program is attached as `solve.py`.
We run it and get:
```console

```
The website contains the following message:
```
Yay. Hi Cracker 
You are the first one to solve the challenge!
Mmm.. Just joking.. Don't tell me you fell for that.
Unfortunately, ArkCon 2020 is cancelled due to the global pandemic.
It's important for us to see you IRL and not just behind the keyboard, so we decided to cancel this year's event and focus our efforts to make ArkCon 2021 the best ArkCon yet.
We already started working closely with our review board and international partners to create an engaging, enriching and challenging 2021 event.
Want to claim your trophy and get ArkCon updates before everyone?
Shoot us an email to ArkCon[at]CyberArk.com with your name and your t-shirt size.
Stay safe,
The ArkCon Team
```
See you next year.
