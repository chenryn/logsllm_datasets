When adding a violation error on an unmapped field, the ViolationMapper
creates a PropertyPath with an empty string, which is invalid and throws an
exception.  
Code to reproduce the issue:
    add('current_password', 'password', array(
                'mapped' => false,
                'constraints' => new UserPassword(),
            ));
