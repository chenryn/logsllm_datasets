User: I have to run a Python script on a Windows server. How can I know which version of Python I have, and does it even really matter?
I was thinking of updating to the latest version of Python.
Assistant: Typing where python on Windows into a Command Prompt may tell you where multiple different versions of python are installed, assuming they have been added to your path.
Typing python -V into the Command Prompt should display the version.
