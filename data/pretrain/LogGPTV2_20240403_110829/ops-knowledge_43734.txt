User: I am trying to interact with an API that uses a timestamp that starts at a different time than UNIX epoch. It appears to start counting on 2000-01-01, but I'm not sure exactly how to do the conversion or what the name of this datetime format is.
When I send a message at 1456979510 I get a response back saying it was received at 510294713.
The difference between the two is 946684796 (sometimes 946684797) seconds, which is approximately 30 years.
Can anyone let me know the proper way to convert between the two? Or whether I can generate them outright in Python?
Thanks
Edit
An additional detail I should have mentioned is that this is an API to a Zigbee device. I found the following datatype entry in their documentation:  

1.3.2.7 Absolute time
  This is an unsigned 32-bit integer representation for absolute time. Absolute time is measured in seconds
  from midnight, 1st January 2000.  

I'm still not sure the easiest way to convert between the two
Assistant: Well, there are 946684800 seconds between 2000-01-01T00:00:00Z and 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z.   So, you can just set a constant for 946684800 and add or subtract from your Unix timestamps.
The variation you are seeing in your numbers has to do with the delay in sending and receiving the data, and could also be due to clock synchronization, or lack thereof.  Since these are whole seconds, and your numbers are 3 to 4 seconds off, then I would guess that the clocks between your computer and your device are also 3 to 4 seconds out of sync.
