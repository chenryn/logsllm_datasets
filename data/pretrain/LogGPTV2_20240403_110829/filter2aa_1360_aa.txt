Michael Bazzell investigated computer crimes on behalf of the government for over 20 years. During the 
majority of that time, he was assigned to the FBI's Cyber Crimes Task Force where he focused on various online 
investigations and open source intelligence (OSINI} collection. As an investigator and sworn federal officer 
through the U.S. Marshals Service, he was involved in numerous major criminal investigations including online 
child solicitation, child abduction, kidnapping, cold-case homicide, terrorist threats, and advanced computer 
intrusions. He has trained thousands of individuals in the use of his investigative techniques and privacy control 
strategies.
After leaving government work, he served as the technical advisor for the first season of the television hacker 
drama Mr. Robot. His books Open Source Intelligence Techniques and Extreme Privacy are used by 
several government agencies as training manuals for intelligence gathering and privacy hardening. He now hosts 
the weekly Privacy, Security, and OSINT show, and assists individual clients in achieving ultimate privacy, 
both proactively and as a response to an undesired situation. More details can be found on his website ar

I have poured every tactic, method, and experience I have into this special hardcover expanded edition. This 
book was accurate as of January 1, 2022. If, or more likely when, you find techniques which no longer 
work, use the overall lessons from the entire book to push through the changes and locate your content. 
Once you develop an understanding of the strategies, you will be ready to adapt. I hope you find something 
valuable here which will aid your own online investigations or research. I am truly excited to introduce a new 
level of OSINT. -MB
Please consider the following technical note in regard to this book. I typically push my self-published titles 
through five rounds of editing. The fees associated with editing a book of this size (over 250,000 words) are 
substantial. This edition was put through only two rounds of editing, so 1 expect a few minor typos still exist. If 
you find any, consider reporting them to errors@inteltechniques.com. My team can correct anything for all 
future printings. The decision to restrict editing was mostly due to hard deadlines for courses, but book piracy 
also played a strong role. We have seen a drastic shift from most readers purchasing the book to the vast majority 
downloading illegal free PDF copies available a few weeks after the initial release. If you purchased this print 
edition, I sincerely thank you. You represent a shrinking society. If you downloaded this book from a shady site, 
please be careful. Many readers reported that poorly-scanned PDFs of the previous edition were infected with 
trackers and malicious code. Never download or open a document from any source which you do not fully trust. 
Please consider purchasing a legitimate copy for yourself or someone else. Sales of this book directly support 
the ad-free podcast which delivers updated content.
The previous (eighth) edition of this book was originally written in late 2020. Soon after publication, I declared 
that 1 was taking a break from writing, which I did. In late 2021,1 was asked to update this book, as it is required 
reading for numerous college courses, university degrees, and government training academies. I never want stale 
or inaccurate information being presented xxdthin training programs, so 1 created this special hardcover revision. 
In the previous editions, 1 only published a new version once I had at least 30% new material and 30% updated 
content. The recycled material was kept to a maximum of 40%. With this edition, I have deviated away from 
that rule. I estimate that only 20% of the content here is changed, with the remaining 80% recycled from the 
previous edition. Much of the eighth edition content was still applicable and only needed minor updates to 
reflect changes since 2020. If you have read the previous edition, you will find most of those overall strategies 
within this book. However, I have added many new OSINT methods which complement the original text in 
order to cater to those who always need accurate information. 1 also removed a lot of outdated content which 
was no longer applicable. 1 believe there is much new value within this updated text. The majority of the updates 
are available in chapters 3, 4, 5, 6, 27, and 28, along with the digital files which accompany them. The other 
chapters all have minor updates.
My primary goals with this new edition are three-fold. First, we need to continue our path of self-reliance which 
was introduced in the previous editions. This ninth edition introduces a completely rebuilt Linux OSINT virtual 
machine which is simpler to create, full of new features, and easier to operate. I present all required commands 
to replicate my own system and offer an automated script which allows you to generate your own working 
environment within just a few minutes. The Windows and Mac sections were also updated to reflect the changes 
offered within Linux. The online and offline search tools were updated to simplify many of the search techniques 
presented throughout the book. Second, I have reworked all of the various OSINT techniques presented 
throughout the book. Many of the search methods targeted toward Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Instagram, 
and other online services which were presented in the previous editions have begun to fail as these companies 
change their products. The updated tutorials here should offer solutions. Finally, I have removed all outdated 
content in order to prevent frustration while attempting broken techniques.
Keeping a book up to date about ways to access information on the internet is a difficult task. Websites are 
constantly changing or disappearing, and the techniques for collecting all possible public information from them 
are affected. However, new resources appear constantly, and much of this book contains new techniques which 
were previously not available.

What is OSINT?
Overall, this book includes several hundred sources of free information and software which could identity 
personal information about anyone you might be investigating. All of the resources are 100% free and open to 
the public, with a few minor exceptions. Each method is explained, and any creative search techniques involving 
the resources are detailed. When applicable, actual case examples are provided to demonstrate the possibilities 
within the methods. The book can be read in any order and referenced when a specific need arises. It is a 
guidebook of techniques that 1 have found successful in my investigations.
Open Source Intelligence, often referred to as OSINT, can mean many things to many people. Officially, it is 
defined as any intelligence produced from publicly available information that is collected, exploited, and 
disseminated in a timely manner to an appropriate audience for the purpose of addressing a specific intelligence 
requirement. For the CIA, it may mean information obtained from foreign news broadcasts. For an attorney, it 
may mean data obtained from official government documents which are available to the public. For most people, 
it is publicly available content obtained from the internet.
Locating this free online information is not the final step of OSINT analysis. Appropriate collection and 
reporting methods will be detailed and referenced. Whether the data you obtain is for an investigation, a 
background check, or identifying problem employees, you must document all of your findings. You cannot rely 
on the information being available online forever. A website may shut down or the data may be removed. You 
must preserve anything of interest when you find it. The free software solutions presented here will help you 
with that. OSINT search techniques do not apply only to websites. There are many free programs which 
automate the search and collection of data. These programs, as well as application programming interlaces, will 
be explained to assist the advanced investigator of open source intelligence. In summary, this book is to serve 
as a reference guide to assist you with conducting more accurate and efficient searches of open source 
intelligence. This is not a debate of the various opinions about online reconnaissance for personal information. 
It is not a historical look at OSINT or a discussion of your administrative policy’. Furthermore, it is not a how­
to guide for criminals to steal your identity. Nothing in this book discusses illegal methods.
As my company continues to provide OSINT training sessions, the audiences seem to grow every year. It is no 
longer a course reserved for tech-sawy employees. We now see people with minimal online experience being 
thrown into investigation and analyst positions. We see crowds desperate for the latest investigation techniques, 
only to see those methods disappear without notice as social networks come and go, or change their search 
options. Search techniques seem to be more fickle than ever, and I am always concerned about losing an online 
resource.
I taught my first Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) course in 1999 to a small group of local police chiefs in 
Illinois. I had not heard of the term OSINT at the time and I did not realize there was an official name for the 
methods I was teaching. I simply thought I was demonstrating a powerful way to use the internet as a pan of 
everyday investigations. Most in the room had little interest in my session, as they had not experienced the 
internet much. Well, times sure have changed. OSINT is now quite the buzz word within several communities. 
Hacking conferences proudly host OSINT training sessions; cyber security groups include it within their 
strategies of hardening systems and customers; law enforcement agencies dedicate entire investigation units to 
online research into criminals; journalists rely on the methods every dag, and even the social engineering crowd 
has adopted it as part of their playbook. I never knew OSINT would become a household name within most 
technology' circles.

I realize that people who use these techniques for devious purposes will read this book as well. Colleagues have 
expressed their concern about this possibility. My decision to document these techniques came down to two 
thoughts. First, anyone that really wants to use this information in malicious ways will do so without this book. 
There is nothing in here that could not be replicated with some serious searching and time. The second thought 
is that getting this information out to those who will use it appropriately is worth the risk of a few people using 
it for the wrong reasons. Please act responsibly with this information.
Finally, a parting thought before you begin your journey through OSINT analysis and collection. This book was 
written as a reference guide. It does not necessarily need to be read straight-through sequentially, but it was 
written as a chronological guide for most investigators. I encourage you to skip around when needed or if you 
feel overwhelmed. The second chapter about Linux may make you want to abandon the teachings before ever 
utilizing an online resource or website. When you encounter material that seems too technical or not applicable, 
please move on to the next chapter and consider returning later. The book is suitable for all skill levels, and there 
is something here for everyone. You can always return to the advanced topics when more appropriate.
Throughout this book, I refer to several files which can be downloaded in order to simplify your usage of the 
various tools, techniques and scripts. These arc all hosted on my website, and available free to you. As each file 
or script is referenced, I provide a download link to simplify the learning process. Please embrace these files as 
a vital part of this book. They should minimize frustration and save time as you replicate the tutorials.
When I first considered documenting my OSINT techniques, the plan was to post them on my website in a 
private area for my co-workers. This documentation quickly turned into over 250 pages of content. It had grown 
too big to place on my site in a manner that was easy to digest. I changed course and began putting together this 
book as a manual to accompany my multiple-day training sessions. It has grown to a huge textbook which could 
never include even’ beneficial resource on the internet.
Many’ readers work in some form of law enforcement or government agency. Police officers 
techniques to help locate missing children or investigate human trafficking. Intelligence analysts can : 
methods to a large part of their daily work as they tackle social media posts. Detectives can use 
techniques to re-investigate cases that have gone unsolved. I embrace these techniques being used to locate facts 
which can help solve crimes. This book also caters to the private sector, especially security divisions of large 
corporations. It can help these teams locate more concise and appropriate information relative to their 
companies. These methods have been proven successful for employees who monitor any' type of threat to their 
company, from physical violence to counterfeit products. I encourage the use of these techniques to institutions 
which are responsible for finding and eliminating "bad apples". This may be the human resources department, 
applicant processing employees, or "head hunters" looking for the best people. The information about a subject 
found online can provide more intelligence than any interview or reference check.
Parents and teachers are encouraged to use diis book as a guide to locating social media content posted by 
children. In many households, the children know more about the internet than the adults. The children use this 
to their advantage and often hide content online. They know that it will not be located by their parents and 
teachers, and often post inappropriate content which can become harmful in the wrong hands. This book can 
empower adults and assist with identifying important personal information which could pose a threat toward 
children. A large portion of my intended audience is private investigators. They can use this book to find 
information without possessing a deep understanding of computers or the internet. Explicit descriptions and 
occasional screen captures will ensure that the techniques can be recreated on any computer. Several universities 
have adopted this book as required reading, and I am honored to play a small role in some amazing courses 
related to network security’.
Let's get started.
OSINT Preparation 1
Se c t io n  I
OSINT PREPARATION
There is a lot to digest here. Please allow yourself to skip over anv technical sections and return to them once 
you understand the overall intent of the material. Many readers skip to Section Two (Chapter Nine - Search 
Engines) and start practicing various online OSINT techniques. Some navigate directly to Chapter Eight to start 
using the free custom search tools. Others read through the entire book before ever touching a computer. 
Approach the content in the way which suits you best. Most importantly, do not let the technical aspects deter 
you from finding areas which will benefit your own investigations the most.
In the following chapters, I will explain how to ensure your computer host is secure; configure virtual machines 
for each investigation; embed Linux applications into Windows and Mac hosts; customize OSINT software 
which will be available at all times; create your own set of search tools to automate queries; prepare a virtual 
Android environment for mobile investigations; and easily clone all of your work for immediate replication if 
anything should become corrupt, damaged, or compromised. Your efforts now will pay off ten-fold in the future.
I have also been guilty of all of this. Early in my career of researching OSINT, I did not pay much attention to 
computer security or proper browsing habits. While I was aware of malicious software, I knew I could reinstall 
Windows if something really bad happened. This was reactive thinking. I believe that we must all proactively 
attack vulnerabilities in our own privacy and security while conducting online research. This section is not meant 
to be a complete guide to computer security or a manual for total privacy. Instead, 1 hope to quickly and 
efficiently propose the most beneficial strategies which will protect you from the majority of problems. Applying 
the changes mentioned in this section will provide a valuable layer of security to your online investigations and 
overall computing habits.
This entire section explains the essential steps which I believe any online investigator should complete before 
ever conducting a search online. We should never jump into an investigation without being digitally secure with 
a clean computer and software which has not been compromised from previous activity. We should begin each 
investigation with confidence, knowing we arc working within an environment without any contamination from 
previous investigations. It will take a lot of work to create our perfect playground, but replicating a pristine 
environment for each investigation will be easy. Much like a DNA forensics lab must be configured and ready 
before an investigation, your OSINT lab should face the same scrutiny.
The first four editions of this book began with search engine techniques. Right away, I offered my methods for 
collecting online information from various popular and lesser-known search websites. This may have been due 
to my own impatience and desire to "dive in" and start finding information. This edition will begin much
