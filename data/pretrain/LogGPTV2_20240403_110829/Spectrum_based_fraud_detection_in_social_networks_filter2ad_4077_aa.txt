ABSTRACT
Social networks are vulnerable to various attacks such as
spam emails, viral marketing and the such. In this paper
we develop a spectrum based detection framework to dis-
cover the perpetrators of these attacks.
In particular, we
focus on Random Link Attacks (RLAs) in which the mali-
cious user creates multiple false identities and interactions
among those identities to later proceed to attack the regular
members of the network. We show that RLA attackers can
be ﬁltered by using their spectral coordinate characteristics,
which are hard to hide even after the eﬀorts by the attackers
of resembling as much as possible the rest of the network.
Experimental results show that our technique is very eﬀec-
tive in detecting those attackers and outperforms techniques
previously published.

INTRODUCTION
Social networks have always been vulnerable to various
attacks including spam emails, annoying telemarketing calls,
viral marketing, and individual re-identiﬁcation in anonymized
social network publishing. Recently, the authors in [4] pro-
vided a general abstraction, called the Random Link Attack
(RLA), which identiﬁes the collaborative nature of these at-
tacks to evade detection. In an RLA, the malicious user cre-
ates a set of false identities and uses them to connect with a
large set of victim nodes. To evade detection, the malicious
user also creates various interactions among false identities,
which make the subgraph formed by false identities similar
to that formed by regular users. This property makes the
discovery of the attack and the responsible entities a diﬃcult
task.

In this paper, we develop a spectrum based fraud detec-
tion framework to identify various attacks. Our approach,
which exploits the spectral space of the underlying interac-
tion structure of the network, is diﬀerent from traditional
topological analysis approaches [2, 4]. Traditional topology
based detection methods explore the graph topology directly
and discover abnormal connectivity patterns caused by at-
tacks. Our approach is based on graph spectral analysis that
deals with the analysis of the spectra (eigenvalues and eigen-
vector components) of the adjacency matrix. We study how
to identify attackers by characterizing their distributions in
the spectral space. Our theoretical results show that attack-
ers locate in a diﬀerent region of the spectral space from
regular users. Speciﬁcally, the spectral coordinate of an at-
tacker is mainly determined by that of its victims. The inner
structure among collaborative attackers has little impact on
attackers’ distributions in the spectral space. By identifying
fraud patterns in graph spectral spaces, we can detect vari-
ous collaborative attacks that are hard to be identiﬁed from
original topological structures.
Focusing on RLAs, we show how the identities of the per-
petrators of the attack can be ﬁltered using their spectral
characteristics. We then show how to identify the RLAs
from the set of suspects obtained by their spectral charac-
teristics. We develop an eﬃcient algorithm, Spctra, which
utilizes a single measure called node non-randomness. We
compare our spectrum-based attack detection approach with
the topology based detection approach [4]. Empirical eval-
uations show that our approach signiﬁcantly improves both
eﬀectiveness and eﬃciency especially when a mix of RLAs
are introduced.
2. A SPECTRUM BASED FRAMEWORK FOR
DETECTING ATTACKS
A network or graph G is a set of n nodes connected by
a set of m links.
It can be represented as the symmetric
adjacency matrix An×n with aij = 1 if node i is connected
to node j and aij = 0 otherwise. Graph spectral analy-
sis deals with the analysis of the spectra (eigenvalues and
eigenvector components) of the nodes in the graph. Let
λj be the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix A and xj
the corresponding eigenvectors, and λ1 ≥ λ2 ≥ ··· ≥ λn.
The spectral decomposition of A is A =
j . Let
xju denote the u-th entry of xj. The eigenvector xj =
(xj1, xj2,··· , xjn)T is represented as a column vector. The
row vector (x1u, x2u,··· , xnu) represents the coordinate of
node u in the n-dimensional spectral space.

In our framework, we exploit the spectral space and char-
747acterize the diﬀerence between the spectral coordinates of
regular users and that of attackers, rather than exploring
the graph topology directly.
and show that the distribution of attackers’ spectral coordi-
nates are determined by ˜zj and ˜λj, which can be calculated
directly from the observed graph ˜A.
3. DETECTING RANDOM LINK ATTACK
In a RLA, the malicious user creates c((cid:191) n) false identi-
ties (attacking nodes) and uses them to connect with a large
set of victims. Attacking node i randomly attack vi victims
and each regular node has the same probability to be a vic-
i=1 vi. To evade
tim. The total number of victims is v =
detection, the malicious user also creates mc links among
attacking nodes, which may make the subgraph formed by
attacking nodes similar to that formed by regular users.
(cid:80)c
In a collaborative attack, the malicious user has complete
control over the attacking nodes and uses them to attack
(e.g., send emails) a large set of victim nodes. Assume there
are c (c (cid:191) n) attacking nodes and they form a subgraph
with adjacency matrix C = {cij}c×c. The outgoing links
from attacking nodes to regular nodes form the subgraph
with adjacency matrix B = (bij)n×c: bij = 1 if the j-th
attacking node has a link to the i-th regular node, and bij =
0 otherwise. The graph after attacks ˜G has N = n+c nodes,
and we can arrange the nodes in the graph so that node 1 to
c are attacking nodes and node c + 1 to N are regular ones.
We have:

Let zj be the eigenvector of A associated to λj, and ˜zj be
the eigenvector of ˜A associated to eigenvalue ˜λj. Then,

where ˜yj = (˜yj1, . . . , ˜yjc)T denotes the entries corresponding
to the attackers in ˜zj and ˜xj = (˜xj1, . . . , ˜xjn)T denotes the
entries corresponding to those regular nodes in ˜zj. Since A is
expanded by adding 0’s into An, xj is then the eigenvector
of An along with the eigenvalue λj. Let ¯xj be the mean
value of entries in xj: ¯xj = 1
n xj. To make the deduction
simple, we choose the sign of xj so that ¯xj ≥ 0.
We denote αu = (x1u, x2u,··· , xku) as the spectral co-
ordinate of regular node u in the original spectral space.
Denote βi = (y1i, y2i,··· , yki) as the spectral coordinate of
attacking node i. Since we assume there is no attack in the
original graph, βi is actually a zero vector. Similarly, we
denote ˜αu = (˜x1u, ˜x2u,··· , ˜xku) and ˜βi = (˜y1i, ˜y2i,··· , ˜yki)
as the spectral coordinate of regular node u and attacking
node i in the perturbed spectral space respectively.

sphere data under a degree attack with 20 attackers.
Figure 1 plots the node spectral coordinates under a de-
gree attack1 with 20 attackers on the political blogosphere
network. We also show node degrees in the z-axis. We
can observe from the ﬁgure that the majority of nodes pro-
jected in the 2-D spectral space distribute along two straight
and quasi-orthogonal lines while attacking nodes (denoted as
black) locate between the two quasi-orthogonal lines in the
spectral projection space.
Result 1. In a graph ˜G under collaborative attacks, for
attacking node i, 1 ≤ i ≤ c, ˜yji can be approximated by:

where Ωr denotes the victim set of attacking node r. For any
regular node u, 1 ≤ u ≤ n, ˜xju is approximately unchanged:
˜xju ≈ xju.
(cid:80)
Result 1 shows that the spectral coordinate of an attacking
node can be approximated by the spectral coordinates of
its victims. When attackers do not collaborate with each
other (C = 0c×c), the second term of the right hand side
of (2) disappears. We simply have ˜yji ≈ 1
xju,
which indicates the attacker’s spectral coordinate is fully
determined by that of its victims. From (2) we can also
observe that the inner structure C among the attackers only
−2
aﬀects ˜yji in the order of λ
. When λj is large, the second
j
term of the right hand side of (2) is already negligible, which
means that the inner subgraph structure has little impact on
the distribution of attackers in the spectral space.

The above result is mathematically elegant. However, in
practice users have no knowledge about which nodes are at-
tackers (or victims). In the next section, we focus on RLAs
