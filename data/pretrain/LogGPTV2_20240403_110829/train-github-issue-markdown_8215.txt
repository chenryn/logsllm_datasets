One of the biggest annoyances with using the fantastic `host_callback.id_tap`
as a logging solution is its behaviour in a `jax.remat` (making a call to
`id_tap` for every `remat`). When you have a codebase with multiple layers of
nested `remat`s, you get spammed with calls to `host_callback.id_tap`, which
both increases the chances of a slowdown due to Python callback overhead, but
also makes it hard to efficiently get rid of spurious duplicated logs coming
from `remat`s.
Is there any way of implementing an option to `id_tap` to avoid calling it
multiple times in a `remat`, or some other workaround?
