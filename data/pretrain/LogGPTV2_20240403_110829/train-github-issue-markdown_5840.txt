Recently updated to 0.12.2 and a checkbox element hooked up to `this.props` is
dynamically updating in the browser. Using the React inspector for Chrome,
`this.props.item.isActive` seems to be toggling fine, but for some reason the
changes don't propagate into the DOM. Not sure if this is specific to the
update, or I've messed something up that I don't realize.
Here's my render function:
    render: function() {
      let className = '';
      if (this.props.item.isActive) className = 'is-active';
      return (
            {this.props.item.text}
      );
    }
