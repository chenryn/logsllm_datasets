demands (CTD) as deﬁned in §5 and shown in the example (Fig-
ure 14) of §5.1. To facilitate comparison, we report the normal-
ized CTD: CTD/CTDideal, where CTDideal is the CTD with an ideal,
non-oversubscribed network. In a 1:N oversubscribed network, the
baseline network has a CTD of N , and obtaining a CTD of 1 im-
plies that with ﬂyways, the network has performed as well as the
ideal, non-oversubscribed network. We will also report statistics on
the numbers of ﬂyways used, the capacities of those ﬂyways and
their utilization.
6.2 Beneﬁts from ﬂyways
Figure 15 plots a CDF of the normalized CTD over all the de-
mands in the dataset on a 1:2 oversubscribed network. For refer-
ence, the normalized CTD of the ideal non-oversubscribed network
and the baseline are 2 and 1 as shown in the ﬁgure. With just one
device per ToR (with NB antennas), Greedy provides signiﬁcant
improvements. About 50% of the demand matrices have a normal-
ized CTD of 1.27, i.e., 27% off the optimal. More than 90% of the
demand matrices experience a speed-up of at least 45% (normalized
CTD < 1.55). This conﬁguration trades roughly half the number of
switches, links and ports (by running at 1:2 oversubscription) for
one wireless device per ToR.
At ﬁrst blush, it is surprising that a large number of demand ma-
trices reach CTD=1.27, but none go lower. The reason is that
CTD improvement is limited by the additional capacity in or out
of each ToR. Given a baseline network oversubscribed N times
and K ﬂyways per ToR of capacity F , the best possible CTD is
N/ (cid:0)1 + KF
C (cid:1), where C is the uplink capacity at each ToR. Then
with the ﬂyway capacity 85% of the ideal 6.756 Gbps wireless bi-
trate and a ToR uplink of 10 Gbps, it follows that for the default
conﬁguration of one device per ToR, the best possible normalized
CTD value is about 1.27. Thus, half of the demand matrices obtain
almost the best possible savings.
Figure 16 compares Greedy with other schemes. We see that
Straggler performs quite poorly. Since high fan-in (and fan-out)

Average Flyway Utilization

correlate with congestion, Straggler runs out of ﬂyways that it can
add. As expected, the supporting result in Figure 17 shows that
Straggler adds many fewer ﬂyways than all of the other schemes.
Ofﬂoading the demands to just the largest neighbor does not impact
the hotlinks by much. Instead, by allowing indirect trafﬁc across
ﬂyways, Transit improves the performance for every demand ma-
trix. Greedy performs even better. Building on the ability to indi-
rect, Greedy searches among many more ﬂyway possibilities and
adds those that allow the most trafﬁc to be ofﬂoaded. Figure 18
shows that for both Transit and Greedy, almost all the ﬂyways are
fully utilized.
In addition, Greedy primarily picks short ﬂyways
that achieve the full possible rate. This indicates that were more ca-
pacity achievable on the ﬂyway link, Greedy’s performance would
improve. These results reafﬁrm the value of allowing transit traf-
ﬁc across ﬂyways and greedily picking the best over the resulting
many possibilities.
6.3 Evaluating alternate conﬁgurations
To understand the solution space better, we evaluate alternatives
with more wireless devices available at each ToR, different antennas
and different degrees of oversubscription on the core.
More wireless devices/ToR: Figure 19 plots the beneﬁts due to ﬂy-
ways when more than one wireless device is available at each ToR.
We see that with just one additional device (K = 2), the improve-
ments in completion time are signiﬁcant. In fact, over 40% of the
matrices ﬁnish as fast as they would have in a non-oversubscribed
network. There are two reasons for this. First, as we saw in Fig-
ure 15, with just one device available per ToR, some of the de-
mand matrices are constrained by the maximum capacity that a ﬂy-
way adds. Additional wireless devices provide immediate beneﬁt to
these matrices. Second, even matrices that are unconstrained by ﬂy-
way capacity experience beneﬁt because with more ﬂyways many
more indirect routes are now feasible. Ever more trafﬁc gets di-
verted away from congested parts of the wired network via ﬂyways
to other wired links that have spare capacity.
Different antenna conﬁgurations: All the results so far were with
a narrow beam, 23 dBi gain, antenna. Figure 20 compares the ben-

eﬁts when different directional antennas are used. We compare
Greedy with Transit, its next best alternative. We ﬁnd that Greedy
works best with the Phocus antennas, even though they are less di-
rectional than NB antennas, due to two reasons. First, Greedy bi-
ases the algorithm to use shorter higher capacity ﬂyways and to then
route trafﬁc indirectly via these links. Most of these short links will
continue to exist even with lower gain antennas. Second, the Pho-
cus array has smaller back and side lobes, resulting in lower inter-
ference, and hence more simultaneously usable links. We ﬁnd that
unlike Greedy, Transit is sensitive to antenna directionality. With
the wider beam antennas, Transit performs considerably worse and
is on par with Straggler+NB. That is, the beneﬁts from allowing
transit trafﬁc are lost with wider antennas. The reason is that with
the wider antennas, there is a greater variation of capacities across
ﬂyways (as predicted by Figure 8) and quicker decay with distance.
The inability to pick ﬂyways other than those between the strag-
gling ToR pair causes Transit to lose its gains. On the other hand,
Greedy’s selectivity allows it to retain most of its gains even with
the wider antennas.
Different oversubscription factors: With a greater oversubscrip-
tion factor, e.g., slower links between the ToR and the core or fewer
core switches in a VL2-like architecture, the network core would
be relatively less expensive. Figure 21 plots the median normalized
CTD across demand matrices for different oversubscription factors.
We see a reasonable trade-off: one can increase the oversubscrip-
tion factor on the wired network and instead spend a small fraction
of that amount to deploy additional wireless devices at each ToR.
The marginal improvement from each additional device decreases,
but the savings are considerable. On a 1:4 oversubscribed network,
ﬂyways with 3 devices per ToR provide a median CTD of 1.78, i.e.,
performance better than a 1:2 oversubscribed network.
7. DISCUSSION
Flyways limitations: For some workloads, such as all-pairs-shufﬂe,
non-oversubscribed networks are indeed more appropriate. How-
ever, these workloads are not reﬂected in our many traces, and we

Oversubscription Factor

believe that such workloads are rare in practice. Our current “ﬂy-
way picker” algorithm requires knowledge of trafﬁc patterns.
In
some cases (e.g., multi-tenant data centers) trafﬁc patterns may not
be predictable, and there may be no cluster-wide scheduler. In such
cases, we believe that an online trafﬁc engineering approach such
as that described in [5], combined with the ability to rapidly steer
antennas (every few seconds) may be the right solution. Design of
ﬂyway validator and ﬂyway picker becomes more interesting when
rapid beam steering is possible; since now a single ﬂyway device
can divide time across multiple neighbors. We are currently investi-
gating the practical issues (e.g., routing) involved in this approach.
Scaling with faster wired networks: The maximum rate speciﬁed
in 802.11ad is 6.76 Gbps. We have shown (§4) that ﬂyway band-
width needs to be only a fraction of the hot link’s capacity. Still,
as the speed of wired links in the data center continues to grow, we
may need faster ﬂyways. Our results in Figure 8 show that many
links have ample SNR headroom and thus have plenty of room to
grow with higher modulations.
In addition, the ﬂyway architec-
ture is not speciﬁc to 60 GHz technology. Other frequencies in the
50–75 GHz band have similar properties and as 60 GHz devices be-
come a mature technology, it may be possible to convince the FCC
to open up more spectrum around the 60 GHz band for indoor data
center use. Given the large lot sizes of data centers and the short
propagation distance of 60 GHz links, it may be possible to use a
wider band while ensuring that no detectable signal leaves the data
center premises.
Scaling the data center size: Network architectures such as VL2 [8]
and FatTree [1] allow the data center to scale easily in addition to
providing full bisection bandwidth. In these designs it is easy to
build a bigger network by simply adding additional switches, in-
stead of investing in larger aggregation switches, or adding more
layers to hierarchy. We can use the ﬂyway architecture in conjunc-
tion with oversubscribed VL2-like networks. The VL2 architecture
can be used for easy scaling, while the ﬂyways are used to address
congestion in a dynamic manner.
Containerized data center networks: While many of today’s large
data centers use a large, open ﬂoor plan (and new ones continue to
be built), some of the new data centers are being built with con-
tainerized architecture. In a container environment, we can either
deploy ﬂyways inside a container, or between containers. Deploy-
ing ﬂyways inside a container, instead of building a full bisection
bandwidth network may allow for cheaper containers, as much less
hardware will be required. On the other hand, inside a container,
ﬂyways may suffer from multipath effects, as radiation bounces off
metal walls of the container. This issue can be addressed in nu-
merous ways — by lining the inside of a container with adsorbent
