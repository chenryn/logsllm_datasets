ABSTRACT
Smart grid deployment initiatives have been witnessed in the
past recent years. Smart grids provide bi-directional com-
munication between meters and headend system through
Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI). Recent studies
highlight the threats targeting AMI. Despite the need of
tailored Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) for the smart
grid [6], very limited progress has been made in this area.
Unlike traditional networks, smart grid has its own unique
challenges, such as limited computational power devices and
potentially high deployment cost, that restrict the deploy-
ment options of intrusion detectors. We show that smart
grid exhibits deterministic and predictable behavior that
can be accurately modeled to develop intrusion detection
system. In this paper, we show that AMI behavior can be
modeled using event logs collected at smart collectors, which
in turn can be veriﬁed using the speciﬁcations invariant gen-
erated from the conﬁgurations of the AMI devices. Event
logs are modeled using fourth order Markov Chain and spec-
iﬁcations are written in Linear Temporal Logic (LTL). The
approach provides robustness against evasion and mimicry
attacks, however, we discuss that it still can be evaded to
a certain extent. We validate our approach on a real-world
dataset of thousands of meters collected at the AMI of a
leading utility provider.

the state-of-the-art smart grids. In the last few years, lead-
ing utility providers have taken the initiative of shifting to
smart grid in order to eﬃciently manage the power while
providing useful features [21]. The basic premise of moving
to smart grid infrastructure is to manage it eﬃciently while
providing uninterrupted low cost energy. The new smart in-
frastructure supports numerous cyber and physical devices
that exhibit a high level dependency. Thus, smart grid is a
highly complex and critical cyber-physical system that re-
quires very rigid security considerations.
An important core network in a smart grid is Advanced
Metering Infrastructure (AMI). AMI provides bi-directional
communication for monitoring and demand-response func-
tions between end devices at customers’ premise like smart
meters and headend at utility provider’s oﬃce. Bi-directional
communication in an AMI makes it possible for an end user
to use the energy eﬃciently at low cost. Moreover, head-
end system can remotely conﬁgure, upgrade, and request
meter reading etc. using the AMI. This inherent criticality
and availability of the AMI makes it a high potential target
for the large-scale attacks that can potentially cause major
regional blackout.
Despite these facts, limited progress has been made so
far in order to detect malicious behavior. Recent studies
including those by the federal government have shown that
AMI is facing immense potential threats [6, 12, 17, 24, 25],
which could aﬀect the deployment and growth of smart grid.
These outline existing vulnerabilities and exploitations, even
though secure communication protocols were used. These
vulnerabilities were exploited to penetrate in the AMI to
gain control of a number of nodes for nefarious purposes.
To countermeasure, some eﬀorts have been made to prevent
these threats [4, 5, 8].
Figure 1 presents a typical example of the AMI. This ﬁg-
ure shows that the meters communicate with the smart col-
lectors using various mediums and smart collectors commu-
nicate with the headend system (and vice versa) using public
networks. Unlike traditional networks, AMI has its own re-
quirements which pose signiﬁcant challenges for monitoring
and intrusion detection since it may require capturing net-
work traﬃc. First, sensor deployment in the meters is prac-
tically infeasible due to the limited computational power and
space resources at the node [22]. Second, although some re-
searchers have suggested the meter-based sensors [4, 8, 27],
smart grid providers as well as vendors ﬁrmly avoid this op-
tion due to the prohibitive cost increase associated with the
large number of meter deployments. Therefore, most IDS
proposals for the AMI lack practical feasibility.

Intrusion detection has gained tremendous attention and
many anomaly-based IDS techniques have been proposed for
the cyber systems [9, 10, 13]. For example, n-gram based in-
trusion detection and markov chain based approaches have
been proposed in the past [26]. n-gram can be seen as pre-
diction using n-1 markov model. However, a markov chain
moves from one state to the next using a weighted list of pos-
sible future states. n-gram can calculate the likelihood for
next state, however, it only gives the statistical distribution
and cannot maintain the temporal order. Since AMI sup-
ports limited protocols and conﬁgurations, temporal speci-
ﬁcations can be deﬁned for markov chain model to devise
speciﬁcation-based intrusion detector. Though n-gram can
be used to design anomaly detection system based on statis-
tical distribution, we believe speciﬁcation-based approach is
better suited for intrusion detection in AMI due to its na-
ture.
The novelty of our approach lies in characterizing AMI
conﬁguration as a baseline for developing a reliable IDS
(high detection and low false positive rate), while consid-
ering the practical computation and operational constrains
of AMI. To the best of our knowledge, no approach exists yet
which uses conﬁgurations for deriving the LTL properties for
markov model.
Recently proposed techniques have reduced the false pos-
itive rate for traditional networks [19]. However, we focus
our attention to the smart grid since these techniques require
learning and are computationally extensive. Therefore, they
do not ﬁt the application requirements of a smart grid.
In [23], an anomaly detection technique for smart grid
has been proposed.
It considers the temporal anomalies
and rank potential intrusion events based on the credibil-
ity impact on power system. It also considers the scenario
where simultaneous cyber intrusions are launched over mul-
tiple substations. The work focuses on the cyber security of
substations in a smart grid. A survey on supervisory control
and data acquisition system (SCADA) speciﬁc intrusion de-
tection and prevention is presented in [28]. However, these
techniques do not cater for the intrusions on an AMI.
In addition to intrusion detection, few studies have been
conducted to highlight the cyber security issues in an AMI
of a smart grid [3,6]. A distributed intrusion detection tech-
nique in a multi-layer architecture of smart grid is proposed
in [27]. It proposes a three layer architecture for home area
network, neighborhood area network and wide area network.
It uses trained support vector machines (SVM) for attack
classiﬁcation at each layer. In [5], the requirements and ar-
chitectural directions are discussed for intrusion detection
in an AMI. Based on the requirements and architectural
directions highlighted in [5], a speciﬁcation-based intrusion
detection technique has been proposed in [4]. This approach
deﬁnes a formal model for C12.22 standard protocol which
is used by diﬀerent meters in the AMI for communication
purposes.
It veriﬁes the speciﬁcation at the application
layer in order to identify anomalous behavior. The pro-
posed approach is protocol speciﬁc. However, not all the
deployed smart grids are using this protocol for communi-
cation. Therefore, it cannot be applied to those AMI infras-
tructures. Moreover, there is no standard implementation
of the protocol available and many vendors keep the imple-
mentation proprietary. An intrusion detection architecture
for the AMI has been proposed in [8]. It uses data mining
Figure 1: Basic AMI network
Deploying detection module at the smart collector pro-
vides the beneﬁt of monitoring both the meter-collector and
collector-headend communication. Moreover, AMI commu-
nication activity is by default logged at the smart collector
thus it does not pose any extra burden. Although device
conﬁguration and log’s integrity is protected using headend-
collector key-pairing, this AMI feature was never exploited
for monitoring and characterizing the AMI behavior. AMI is
a special purpose network and its traﬃc dynamics are often
very low since it supports a limited number of protocols and
it is conﬁguration-driven. Moreover, similar devices from
limited vendors are usually deployed. To exploit the lim-
ited behavior, simple speciﬁcation-based intrusion detection
techniques are proposed in the recent literature [4] instead
of traditional anomaly-based intrusion detectors.
In this paper, we present a novel device conﬁguration
based stochastic model checking intrusion detection tech-
nique. It is designed to ﬁt the requirements and log char-
acteristics of the AMI. We model the AMI infrastructure
behavior using the logs generated at the smart collector.
Stochastic model based on 4-th order markov chain is used,
since it exhibits a low conditional entropy, in order to repre-
sent the AMI probabilistic behavior. Probabilistic behavior
is observed as a result of its conﬁguration and nature of the
network. Speciﬁcations written in Linear Temporal Logic
(LTL) are automatically generated from the a-priori known
conﬁgurations of the AMI devices (smart meters and collec-
tors), which in turn are then probabilistically veriﬁed using
the stochastic model generated from the smart collector’s
logs. The proposed technique exhibits high accuracy and
it can be easily deployed in the existing AMI of a smart
grid. Moreover, the approach provides robustness against
evasion and mimicry attacks, however, we discuss that it
can be still evaded to a certain extent. For experimentation
and evaluation we use a real-world dataset of more than two
thousand meters obtained as a result of our collaboration
with a leading smart grid based utility provider. Our exper-
imental evaluation shows promising results for the proposed
model i.e., accuracy rate of more than 95% with negligible
false alarms of 0.2%.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 dis-
cusses the related work followed by the dataset described in
Section 3. Section 4 discusses the statistical analysis of the
logs collected at the smart collectors. Based on the analysis,
a stochastic model is proposed in Section 5. Properties are
speciﬁed using LTL language which is described in Section
6. Attack model and evaluation of the proposed approach is
shown in Section 7 along-with the discussion on robustness
against evasion, scalability and limitations. Section 8 con-
cludes the work followed by the background of AMI in the
Appendix.

based intrusion detection technique for the AMI. It requires
deployment at smart meter, smart collector and headend
system.
All of the proposed approaches for intrusion detection in
the AMI assume a computationally expensive intrusion de-
tection module deployment at the meter level. However,
this may not be practically feasible since meters do not have
enough computation power [22].
If the detection modules
are to be deployed as a stand alone unit next to the meter,
it requires signiﬁcantly higher cost. We argue that due to
this higher deployment cost, industrial deployments of the
intrusion detector for the AMI have not been witnessed yet.
In this work, we propose a solution which is cost eﬀective
and practical since it can be deployed either in the headend
system or in the AMI.
3. DATASET
In AMI, the real-world dataset is important since all of the
contemporary work uses simulation which may not necessar-
ily reﬂect the true behavior of the system under considera-
tion. Therefore, it is very important to analyze a real-world
dataset in order to reveal its true behavior. To this end, we
use real-world dataset collected at an AMI of a leading smart
grid based utility provider. A smart grid testbed is also es-
tablished by the utility provider at our institute in order to
conduct experiments locally in a controlled environment. It
includes a monitoring/management node which is capable
of monitoring and conﬁguring the nodes in an AMI, also re-
ferred as Network Management System (NMS). The testbed
also includes the multiple smart meters and smart collectors,
both of which are capable of bi-directional communication.
Since it is not practically feasible to capture network traf-
ﬁc, we work with the event logs generated at the smart col-
lector. Since event logging is an inherent capability of a
smart collector, it does not impose any extra burden on the
smart collector. These logs are saved at smart collector for
sometime and then deleted in a cyclic manner. We conduct
oﬄine analysis of the logs in order to avoid any service dis-
ruption. We collected logs of multiple smart collectors for a
total period of two weeks in two sessions of one week each
denoted by Log-1 and Log-2. Approximately more than two
thousand meters were communicating with the smart col-
lectors. The AMI infrastructure used devices from multiple
vendors. Sample and anonymized basic conﬁguration of the
meters is shown in Table 1.
In the AMI under consider-
ation, reporting mode for the meters was ‘push’ i.e., the
meter will send scheduled readings by itself at the interval
speciﬁed in the ‘Reporting Time’.

the number of seconds after which a sample is taken. Simi-
larly, Table 2 shows the conﬁguration of the smart collectors.
It can be observed that the smart collector is aware of its
neighboring meters and the link through which they are con-
nected. In our case study, meters were communicating with
the smart collectors using both the power line and wireless
media. However, the analysis and technique discussed in this
work is generic and should hold across other communication
models as well.
Sample log entries of a smart collector are shown in Ta-
ble 3. These entries are simpliﬁed and anonymized to show
only the information required in this work. Each log en-
try has the event time stamp. Here we show the relative
time stamp with respect to the start of the logging event.
However, it is absolute in practice. Time stamp is followed
by the source and destination ID of the nodes involved in
the communication event. Size of the communication is also
logged in kilo bytes (KB). Lastly, the type of event is also
logged. For example, 0 represents that it was a meter read-
ing report. 1, 2 and 3 represents disconnect/reconnect, up-
grade and load management communication, respectively.
We show the statistical analysis of the logs collected in the
next section which forms the basis of our model.
4. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
We analyzed a number of statistical properties of the log
entries. One relevant property that provided us with in-
teresting insights was the analysis of their temporal depen-
dence.
It can be intuitively argued that, as long as the
log entries are produced by benign events, the log entries
observed should exhibit a certain level of temporal depen-
dence. In case of malicious behavior, perturbations in this
dependence structure are ﬂagged as anomalous. Therefore,
the level of temporal dependence can serve as an important
metric for modeling the log entries.
Autocorrelation measures the on-average temporal depen-
dence between the random variables in a stochastic process
at diﬀerent points in time. For a given lag k, the autocor-
relation function of a stochastic process Xn (where n is the
time index) is deﬁned as:
