## Abstract
In recent years, the deployment of smart grids has gained significant momentum. Smart grids facilitate bidirectional communication between meters and headend systems through Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI). Recent studies have highlighted the various threats targeting AMI. Despite the need for tailored Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) for smart grids, very limited progress has been made in this area. Unlike traditional networks, smart grids face unique challenges, such as limited computational power and high deployment costs, which restrict the options for deploying intrusion detectors. This paper demonstrates that the behavior of smart grids is deterministic and predictable, making it possible to model and develop an effective IDS. We propose a configuration-based IDS for AMI, leveraging event logs collected at smart collectors. These logs are modeled using a fourth-order Markov Chain, and specifications are written in Linear Temporal Logic (LTL). Our approach provides robustness against evasion and mimicry attacks, although it can still be evaded to some extent. We validate our approach using a real-world dataset from a leading utility provider.

## 1. Introduction
The energy infrastructure is transitioning to a new era, with legacy systems being replaced by state-of-the-art smart grids. Leading utility providers have initiated this shift to efficiently manage power while offering useful features. The primary goal of smart grid infrastructure is to manage power efficiently and provide uninterrupted, low-cost energy. Smart grids integrate numerous cyber and physical devices, making them highly complex and critical cyber-physical systems that require stringent security measures.

A key component of a smart grid is the Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI), which provides bidirectional communication for monitoring and demand-response functions between end devices (like smart meters) and the headend system at the utility provider's office. This bi-directional communication allows users to use energy more efficiently at a lower cost. Additionally, the headend system can remotely configure, upgrade, and request meter readings via the AMI. The inherent criticality and availability of AMI make it a prime target for large-scale attacks, potentially causing major regional blackouts.

Despite these risks, limited progress has been made in detecting malicious behavior. Recent studies, including those by federal agencies, have shown that AMI faces significant potential threats, which could affect the deployment and growth of smart grids. To counter these threats, some efforts have been made, but most IDS proposals for AMI lack practical feasibility due to the computational and deployment constraints.

## 2. Related Work
Intrusion detection has received considerable attention, with many anomaly-based IDS techniques proposed for cyber systems. For example, n-gram and Markov Chain-based approaches have been used. While n-gram models can predict the next state based on statistical distribution, they do not maintain temporal order. In contrast, Markov Chains can model temporal dependencies, making them more suitable for AMI, which supports limited protocols and configurations. Temporal specifications can be defined for Markov Chain models to create specification-based intrusion detectors.

Our approach leverages AMI configurations to develop a reliable IDS, considering the practical computation and operational constraints. To the best of our knowledge, no existing approach uses configurations to derive LTL properties for Markov models.

Recently, techniques have reduced false positive rates in traditional networks, but they are computationally intensive and unsuitable for smart grids. Some studies have focused on anomaly detection in smart grids, but they do not address AMI-specific intrusions. Other studies have highlighted cybersecurity issues in AMI, but their solutions are either protocol-specific or impractical due to high deployment costs.

## 3. Dataset
Real-world datasets are crucial for accurately modeling AMI behavior. We use a dataset collected from a leading utility provider's AMI. The dataset includes logs from multiple smart collectors over a two-week period, covering more than two thousand meters. The AMI infrastructure uses devices from multiple vendors, and the logs include event timestamps, source and destination IDs, communication size, and event types.

## 4. Statistical Analysis
We analyzed the statistical properties of the log entries, focusing on temporal dependence. Autocorrelation, which measures the average temporal dependence between random variables at different points in time, is a key metric. For a given lag \( k \), the autocorrelation function of a stochastic process \( X_n \) (where \( n \) is the time index) is defined as:

\[
\rho_k = \frac{\text{Cov}(X_n, X_{n+k})}{\sqrt{\text{Var}(X_n) \text{Var}(X_{n+k})}}
\]

This analysis forms the basis of our model, providing insights into the temporal behavior of the log entries.

## 5. Stochastic Model
We model the AMI behavior using a fourth-order Markov Chain, chosen for its low conditional entropy. The probabilistic behavior of the AMI is derived from its configuration and network nature. Specifications written in LTL are automatically generated from the known configurations of AMI devices and verified using the stochastic model.

## 6. LTL Specifications
Specifications in LTL are used to define the expected behavior of the AMI. These specifications are automatically generated from the known configurations and verified against the stochastic model.

## 7. Attack Model and Evaluation
We evaluate our approach using the real-world dataset. Our experimental results show a high accuracy rate of over 95% with a negligible false alarm rate of 0.2%. The approach is robust against evasion and mimicry attacks, though it can still be evaded to a certain extent.

## 8. Conclusion
We present a novel configuration-based IDS for AMI, leveraging event logs and a fourth-order Markov Chain model. Our approach is practical, cost-effective, and can be deployed in existing AMI systems. Future work will focus on further enhancing robustness and scalability.
