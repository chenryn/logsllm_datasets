Moving Beyond Set-It-And-Forget-It Privacy Settings on Social Media
CCS ’19, November 11–15, 2019, London, United Kingdom
C ADDITIONAL FIGURES
This appendix presents a series of supplementary graphs and tables.
First, we present four additional graphs for our predictive models,
showing the relative performance of the different classifiers we
tested on the same data. We then present two graphs analogous
to those in the paper showing temporal patterns in the number of
Facebook friends per participant and the privacy settings of posts.
Different from the analogous graphs in the paper that included
only the cohort whose accounts were at least a decade old, these
variants show data from all participants. Finally, we include Table 6,
which details the features we extracted from our survey or pro-
grammatically collected and then leveraged in our prediction task.
These features are divided into four categories. In each category
we consider multiple features.
Figure 11: Precision vs. recall for the friend-post dataset.
(a) Average Precision@k on full test set
Figure 12: Average precision@k for post dataset.
(b) Average Precision@k on test without label “doesn’t matter”
Figure 10: Precision@k curves for the friend-post dataset,
comparing the original dataset and removing the label
doesn’t matter from the testing folds. The preference for
doesn’t matter is most of the interference for the preci-
sion@k curves. We compare Logistic Regression (LR), De-
cision Trees (DT), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Ran-
dom Forests (RF), XGBoost (XGB), Deep Neural Networks
(DNN), random assignment (Random), and an interaction-
based model (Interaction), as detailed in Section 8.1.

friends who were their Facebook friends in the past. The
