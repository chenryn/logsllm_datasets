### Patch Preparation and Deployment

Patch preparation begins when a vulnerability is disclosed, and a patch becomes available. This process often starts concurrently with the threat assessment. The time delay for testing the patch ranges from 10 to 20 days, represented as:
\[ \text{fp\_testing\_delay (testing)} = U(10, 20) \]

Patch deployment follows three timelines, depending on the results of the threat assessment. For large organizations with over 100,000 systems, we selected a range for normal patching that spans from 68 to 204 days:
\[ \text{fpatching\_delay (tpatching)} = U(68/\text{rate}, 204/\text{rate}) \]
where \(\text{rate} = 1, 2,\) or \(4\). Accelerated and emergency patching would be twice and four times faster, respectively.

These time periods for patch deployment may seem lengthy, but they are realistic for organizations with a large number of systems, especially those running critical business applications. The delays are often due to business restrictions on system downtime rather than resource constraints. For critical vulnerabilities, immediate patching is prioritized, and additional downtime periods are allocated.

### Signature-Based Mitigation

Signature-based mitigation can be triggered after the threat assessment determines that such mitigations are effective for the disclosed vulnerability. We assume that security software vendors provide these signatures, so the organization's security team does not need to prepare and test them. The time delay includes the time for the vendor to create signatures and for the organization's systems to receive the updates. This delay ranges from 3 to 5 days:
\[ \text{fsignature\_delay (tsignature)} = U(3, 5) \]

### Workaround Deployment

Workaround deployment begins when a patch is not available, but the threat assessment team declares an emergency. This process typically takes 2-3 days to complete.

### Analysis of Internal Processes

We believe that the chosen internal process parameters, decision processes, and mitigation mechanisms are representative of a wide range of large organizations. However, specific details like patch deployment timelines may vary. A strength of this modeling approach is that parameters can be easily adjusted to capture variations in processes or decision points.

### Experimental Simulations

The experimental runs involved simulating 100,000 vulnerabilities. Each vulnerability had a 0.72 chance of having an exploit code and a 0.97 chance of having a patch, with time delay probability distributions sampled for each event. The time delay distribution for malware events was sampled with a rate parameter of 25 days, and the probability of malware was set at 0.84 for vulnerabilities where exploits appeared beforehand.

### Exposure Window Analysis

First, we examined how long an organization would be exposed under the defined security processes and mitigations. The exposure window was analyzed across all vulnerabilities and then focused on high-risk vulnerabilities.

In subsequent experiments, we introduced more signature or heuristic-based mitigations, varying their effectiveness from 3% to 45% of the vulnerability population. We also examined the impact of increasing patch deployment speed by 1.5 and 2 times, representing scenarios with fewer vulnerable systems.

### Results

Figure 3 shows the histogram of the time it takes to minimize the risk of a vulnerability from its disclosure. With default parameters, around 47% of cases take between 180 and 360 days to reduce risk, primarily reaching time point T6 in the vulnerability timeline. Standard patching was applied to 97% of vulnerabilities, taking an average of 136 days. Delays such as waiting for patches, internal assessments, and business-related delays can extend the exposure window beyond the average.

Figure 4 focuses on critical vulnerabilities, showing the difference in risk reduction time with early mitigations at 45%. Even with 45% of critical vulnerabilities mitigated, there is still a long tail of vulnerabilities taking more than 120 days. Assuming malware arrives at a mean rate of 25 days, nearly 52% of vulnerabilities are mitigated within 10 days of malware reports, leaving 48% of instances with major potential impact.

This analysis highlights that large organizations may remain unmitigated for much longer than the expected average of 136 days. Intelligent and early threat assessment is crucial for reducing exposure to highly critical vulnerabilities.
