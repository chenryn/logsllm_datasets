Patch 
preparation 
begins  whenever 
the 
vulnerability  is  disclosed  and  patch  is  available.  This 
process  sometimes  starts  concurrently  with  threat 
assessment.  It  is  represented  as  a  time  delay  ranging 
from 10 to 20 days: 
fp_testing_delay (testing) = U (10, 20). 
Patch  deployment  has  three  timelines  that  are 
selected  depending  on  the  result  from  the  threat 
assessment  stage.  We  decided 
the 
environment of large organizations that have in excess 
of 100,000 systems and selected fairly large range for 
how  long  normal  patching  across  these  numbers  of 
machines would take: minimum 68 days and maximum 
to  simulate

where rate = 1, 2, or 4. 
Although  these  time  periods  for  patch  deployment 
seem  quite 
they  are  actually  realistic  for 
organizations with large number of systems, especially 
if 
running  business  critical 
applications. The time delays in such cases are usually 
due 
to  restrictions  set  by  business  on  systems 
downtime periods rather than resource constraints. For 
critical  vulnerabilities,  due  to  increased  likelihood  of 
exposure,  the  immediate  patching  of  vulnerabilities 
would  be  raised  as  priority,  and  so  businesses  would 
allocate additional periods for system downtime.  
Signature-based  mitigation  deployment  might  be 
triggered  after  threat  assessment  has  determined  that 
such  mitigations  work  for  the  type  of  disclosed 
vulnerability.  We  assume  that  such  signature  based 
mechanisms  would  be  provided  by  security  software 
vendors,  and  the  security  team  in  an  organization 
would not need to do their own preparation and testing. 
The  time  delay  would  then  include  only  the  time  it 
takes  for  a  vendor  to  create  signatures  and  for  the 
systems  in  an  organization  to  get  the  updates.  We 
selected this delay as being between 3 and 5 days:  
fsignature_delay (tsignature) = U (3, 5). 
The workaround deployment process starts in those 
cases  where  a  patch  is  not  available,  but  the  threat 
assessment  team  still  declares  emergency  remediation 
â€“ this process takes around 2-3 days to complete.

the  decision  process  and 
mitigation  mechanisms  captured  in  the  model  are 
representative  of  a  wide  range  of  large  organizations, 
but some of the specific details such as the time lines 
for  patch  deployment  would  be  different.  However, 
one of the strengths of this modelling approach is that 
parameters  such  as  these  can  be  easily  adjusted  and 
variations in processes or decision points can be easily 
captured in the model.

distribution  for  malware  event  was  sampled  with  rate 
parameter of 25 days, and, based on the amount of past 
emergency  patching  due  to  malware  appearing  in  the 
wild,  the  probability  of  malware  was  set  at  0.84  for 
vulnerabilities  where 
appeared 
beforehand.

Given these threat environment parameters, we first 
examined how long (in terms of days) an organization 
would  be  exposed  when  its  security  processes  and 
chosen mitigations were performing as defined by the 
parameters  described  in  section  4.4.  The  exposure 
window was examined across the full vulnerability set, 
and  then  zooming  in  on  vulnerabilities,  which  threat 
assessment  determined  were  of  high  risk  for  the 
organization.  
In  the  next  set  of  experiments  we  wanted  to 
examine  the  changes  in  the  length  of  the  exposure 
window as we introduce more mitigation that would be 
signature or heuristic based, and so deployed soon after 
the vulnerability was disclosed. This could be the case 
if, for example, the security operations team decide to 
add  intrusion  prevention  mechanisms.  We  recognize 
that  the  effectiveness  of  such  mechanisms  may  vary, 
with  signatures  available  only  for  a  proportion  of 
vulnerabilities. To reflect that,  we performed  multiple 
simulations by varying effectiveness of signature-based 
measures: range starting  from the signatures available 
for 3% of vulnerability population and increasing up to 
45%.  
We  also  examined  what  the  model  predicts  will 
happen to the time taken to achieve full patching when 
the  patch  deployment  speed  is  increased  1.5  and  2 
times. This could be representative of the cases where 
the  number  of  vulnerable  systems  is  smaller  and  so 
patch deployment is faster. 
The  experiments  were  run  across  vulnerability 
instances,  and  we  sampled  the  various  time  points 
within the vulnerability timeline that was introduced in 
section 4.1. The data from simulations was then plotted 
as  histograms  with 
the 
proportion  of  vulnerabilities  in  100,000  instances, 
while the  x-axis represents the time  taken in days  for 
the vulnerability risk to be reduced (to reach time point 
T3 or T6 within the vulnerability timeline).  
the  y-axis  representing 
5.1. Exposure window analysis 
Figure 3 shows the histogram of the time it takes for 
an  organization  to  minimize  the  risk  of  vulnerability 
from  the  time  when  it  was  first  disclosed,  where  the 
model  was  executed  with  default  parameters  as 
described  in  section  4,  and  spans  across  all  types  of 
vulnerabilities.  As  is  visible  from  this  diagram,  for 
2939
around  47%  of  all  simulated  cases,  it  takes  between 
180 and 360 days for risk to be reduced, which mainly 
includes  reaching  time  point  T6  in  the  vulnerability 
timeline.    Within  our  default  settings  the  standard 
patching  was  applied  across  97%  of  vulnerabilities, 
with this type of patching taking 136 days on average, 
so the results reflect those settings.  However, they also 
highlight  that  various  delays  such  as  waiting  for 
patches  to  be  released  from  the  software  vendor, 
internal  patch  assessment  and  testing,  as  well  as 
business related delays may push the exposure window 
quite a few days beyond the average, leaving systems 
exposed for longer than might be expected.

Figure 4. Critical vulnerabilities. 
When we zoom in on these types of vulnerabilities 
as  shown  in  figure  4  (the  histogram  with  early 
mitigations at 45%) we can clearly see the difference in 
the time that it takes to reduce the risk. However, we 
should  note  that  we  assumed  that  for  these  types  of 
vulnerabilities, 
can  deploy 
signature-based  mitigation 
in  around  45%  of 
vulnerability instances (or 3% of the total population).

When those mitigations are removed, as represented in 
the histogram with early mitigations at 0%, the average 
exposure window is much longer.  
Even  when  signature-based  mitigations  are  effective 
for 45% of the critical vulnerability population, there is 
still a long tail that includes vulnerabilities taking more 
120 days. Since the chance of there being malware for 
these  types  of  vulnerabilities  is  fairly  high,  the 
vulnerabilities  in  the  tail  might  present  major  risk. 
Assuming  that  malware  arrives  at  a  mean  rate  of  25 
days, 
the  proportion  of 
vulnerabilities  which  would  be  mitigated  within  10 
days of malware reports, is nearly 52% (the histogram 
with  early  mitigations  at  45%),  with  the  remaining 
48%  of  vulnerability  instances  where  malware  could 
have major impact.
