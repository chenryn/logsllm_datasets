User: I downloaded the actual py2exe package.
But I've no idea how to get it in my system. I mean I can follow the tutorial a 100% but I can't find anything how to install py2exe to my kubuntu 11.10.
I also can't find a py2exe.py which I could include to my workingfolder. 
Could some please help me the project has to be finish till tomorrow? 
Thanks for your help
cheers,
Chris
Assistant: Py2exe has to run on Windows, you can not run it in Linux. (Maybe wine can help, but I'm not sure)
