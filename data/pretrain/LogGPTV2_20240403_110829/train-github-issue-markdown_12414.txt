I am referencing a `statsmodels` issue (#5419, for which I just added a
comment) because it affects the kde plots in `seaborn` when `IQR = 0` leads to
`bw = 0`
I wonder if there is a possibility to handle it with `try except`.  
It was suggested by someone with clearly a better understanding that I have
maybe to "check if IQR is 0 and then perhaps add noise (with some level) so
the IQR and SD are similar. If you have SD = 0, then ... then it should just
plot point ... maybe"
