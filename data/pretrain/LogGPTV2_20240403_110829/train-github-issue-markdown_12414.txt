I am referring to an issue in `statsmodels` (issue #5419, to which I recently added a comment) that affects the kernel density estimation (KDE) plots in `seaborn` when the interquartile range (IQR) is zero, leading to a bandwidth (`bw`) of zero.

To address this, I am considering using a `try-except` block. However, someone with more expertise suggested a different approach: checking if the IQR is zero and, if so, adding a small amount of noise to the data. This would ensure that the IQR and standard deviation (SD) are non-zero and similar. If the SD is also zero, the plot should simply display a single point.

Would this be a viable solution?
