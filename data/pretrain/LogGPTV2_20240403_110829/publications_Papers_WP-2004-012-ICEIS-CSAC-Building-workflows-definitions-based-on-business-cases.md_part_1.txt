Abstract. The maturity of infrastructures that support e-services allows
organizations to incorporate Web services as part of their business processes.
One prominent solution to manage, coordinate, and orchestrate Web services is
the use of workflow technology. While workflow management systems
architectures, language specifications, and workflow analysis techniques have
been extensively studied there is a lack of tools and methods to assist process
development. The purpose of our study is to present a framework to assist
process analysts and designers in their task, allowing the creation of processes
(Web processes and workflows) with a higher quality. The framework
structures a comprehensive set of steps that drives the analysis and design of
processes based on requirements gathered from communication with managers
and experts.
1. Introduction
The Web, the development of E-commerce, and new architectural concepts such as
Web services have created the basis for the emergence of a new networked economy
[1]. With the maturity of infrastructures that support e-commerce, it will be possible
for organizations to incorporate Web services as part of their business processes. A
wide spectrum of modern workflow system architectures has been developed to
support various types of business processes [2].
Research has targeted three main areas: workflow architectures, specification
languages, and process analysis. These areas of research are of recognized importance
for the construction of sophisticated and robust workflow systems. Nevertheless, one
important area has been overlooked, the research of the lifecycle of process
application development.
In fact, studies on the lifecycle of process development have been reduced and are
almost inexistent. In 1996, Sheth et al. [3] established that workflow and process
modeling was one of the outstanding research issues which should be investigated.
The lifecycle of workflow applications development is comparable to the lifecycle
of software development [4]. The use of adequate methodologies to assist the
lifecycle of processes development is a key determinant to the success of any

workflow project and requires the availability of specific tools – different from the
ones used in software development – to model each phase of the cycle.
Our work has started with the use of expressive graphical process modeling
languages (such as STRIM [5]) to model workflows [6]. In this paper, we argue that
better methodological support for stepwise creation of Web processes and workflows
that can ensure the fulfillment of business processes’ strategic goals is necessary.
Our work targets the development of a framework to assist process analysts and
designers to model business processes and design workflows. The framework is to be
used during the analysis and design phase. It can be viewed as a methodology which
structures a comprehensive set of steps that drives the design of workflows based on
requirements gathered from communication with staff, managers, and domain experts.
This paper is structured in the following way. Section 2 presents the requirements of
our framework. In section 3, we present and describe our framework. Finally, section
4 presents our conclusions.
2. Framework Goals
Practitioners, consultants, as well as academics, have differing views about business
process and workflow development. Some organizations view workflow development
as an ad-hoc activity to archive the automation of a few manual procedures, others
view it as the improvement or redesign of isolated business processes, and only a
minority view it as a comprehensive process re-organization, and use methodologies,
lifecycles, and modeling tools to decompose organization’s ongoing activities into a
well defined set of workflows.
Workflow modeling lifecycle is composed of various phases, including analysis,
design, implementation, testing, and maintenance. The number of phases and the
phases themselves are not structured in a rigid manner. Therefore, several
methodologies can be used for workflow development, comparable to the water fall
model, spiral model, and rapid prototyping model.
In our study, we are particularly interested in two phases: analysis and design. Each
phase includes a set of different perspectives that needs to be considered when
developing a framework for workflow analysis and design.
Our goal is to supply a framework to assist workflow developers in their task,
independently of the methodology used for workflow development. Our framework is
a basic conceptional structure composed of steps, procedures, and algorithms that
determine how process analysis and design is to be approached.
3. The Framework
The intention of this section is to give an overall description of our framework to
construct workflows based on the knowledge gathered from interviews, group

brainstorming sessions, and meetings (in this paper we will use the term ‘interview’ to
designate these three methods of gathering knowledge).
The interviews are essentially carried out between process analysts and people who
have the expertise and knowledge of the processes’ business logic. The latter group
might, typically include people such as administrative staff, department managers,
mid-range managers, and even CEOs.
The input of the framework presented in this paper is a set of task names, and the
output is a workflow. The workflows include tasks or Web services, transitions,
control flow variables, and control flow conditions. The framework relies heavily on
interviews to supply the knowledge which cannot be inferred automatically.

The framework has four major steps which are discussed individually in the
following sections. These steps are the construction of business case table, extraction
of scheduling functions, identification of basic block structures, and the cleaning,
analysis, and implementation of the workflow. The phases are carried out sequentially
as illustrated in Fig. 1.
3.1 Business Case Table Construction
The basic property of a process is that it is case-based [7]. This means that every
task is executed for a specific case. Use cases have long been advocated for business
process design as well as software design [8]. To capture all the cases represented in a
process, we introduce the concept of business case table. The table has the main
advantage of being a simple, yet powerful, tool to capture and describe business
cases.
In the first phase, by means of interviews, we build a business case table. Each
business case corresponds to an entry in the table and establishes the task scheduled at
runtime based on business variables assertion. Business variables are variables that
influence the routing or control flow in a process. For example, in a banking Web
process application, the business variable Loan Amount determines the acceptance or
rejection of a loan request. If the variable has a value greater than $500.000, then the
loan is rejected and the task ‘reject‘ is executed, otherwise the task ‘accept’ is
executed.
A business case table is based on a two dimensional table. The schema of the table
is the following. The columns are divided into two classes. The first class regroups a
set of business variables, while the second class includes the tasks that are part of a
process. Each entry of the table relates business variables and tasks with information
indicating if a task is to be scheduled at runtime or not.

The first cells of each row, corresponding to the columns of the first class, contain
values that can be assigned to business variables. The data cells corresponding to the
columns of the second class contain information indicating if a particular task is to be
scheduled at runtime or not. The idea is to establish if a given task is to be scheduled
based on the assertion of a set of business variables. Formally, we are interested in
evaluating for each task the following function, where bv is a business variable:
t i
scheduled(task, bv , bv , …, bv ) ∈ {, } (1)
t 1 2 n
A data cell corresponding to the columns of the second class may contain the
scheduled symbol () or the not-scheduled symbol ().
Understanding the business case table schema is relatively easy, whereas its
construction is far more challenging and complex. The methodology (described in
[9]) to construct and fill the table with business cases is an iterative and interactive
process carried out through interviews. Its construction requires the involvement of
designers and managers. For each row and for each column of the second class, it
should be inquired the symbol of function (1). Example of a business case table is
shown in Table 1.

Symbol Conflicts. One important step when constructing a business case table is
resolving symbol conflicts. Symbol conflicts indicate that the scheduling of a set of
tasks depends on one or more business variables. This can be verified when the two
available symbols have been assigned to the same data cell in the business case table.
To resolve a symbol conflict, the process analyst – with the help of interviewees –
should identify at least one business variable that controls the scheduling of a
conflicting task. When such a variable is identified the following steps are taken:
1. A column is added to the left side of the business case table and rows are added to
the table.

2. The column is labeled with the name of the business variable identified.
3. Each row of the table is duplicated n-1 times, where n is the domain set cardinality
of the newly introduced business variable.
4. The data cells corresponding to the new business variable column are set to the
values of its domain.
Once the table’s schema is updated to reflect the introduction of a new business
variable, the data cells must also be updated with appropriate scheduling symbols. As
previously, the process analyst should carry out (additional) interviews to determine
which tasks are scheduled at runtime based on the business variables present in the
table.
Quality of Service. One important requirement of business processes is the
management of Quality of Service (QoS). During the construction of a business case
table, the business analyst and domain expert set QoS estimates for each task. The
estimates characterize the quality of service that a task will exhibit at runtime. Quality
of service can be characterized according to various dimensions. In our framework,
we have used a QoS model [10] composed of the following dimensions: time, cost,
and reliability. The information will be used in a latter phase to compute the QoS of
the overall business process.
3.2 Extracting Scheduling Functions from the Business Case Table
In the second phase, we extract a set of scheduling functions from the business case
