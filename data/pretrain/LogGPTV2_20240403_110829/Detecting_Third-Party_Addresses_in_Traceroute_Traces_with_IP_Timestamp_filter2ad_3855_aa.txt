## Abstract
Traceroute is a widely used diagnostic tool for computer networks. Although it is often employed to infer links between Autonomous Systems (ASes), the presence of third-party (TP) addresses can lead to the inference of false AS-level links. This paper introduces a novel active probing technique based on the IP timestamp option to identify TP addresses. To evaluate the applicability and utility of our technique, we conducted a large-scale measurement campaign targeting over 327,000 destinations across approximately 14,000 ASes from multiple vantage points. Our results show that TP addresses are very common, affecting about 17% of AS-level links extracted from traceroute traces. Compared to a previously proposed heuristic method, our technique identifies many more TP addresses and reinterprets some of its results.

## 1. Introduction
An accurate understanding of the Internet topology is essential for comprehending this complex and ever-evolving system [7, 11, 19, 20]. In the last decade, numerous attempts have been made to overcome the incompleteness of BGP-derived AS-level topologies [12] using traceroute [4, 8, 13]. However, traceroute is known to be inaccurate and can introduce errors when used to infer the Internet topology [15, 17, 27].

One source of inaccuracy is the presence of third-party (TP) addresses [14, 18], which are associated with interfaces not actually traversed by the IP packets sent toward the traceroute destination. While several other factors can affect the accuracy of AS links derived from traceroute—such as divergence between data and control paths, anonymous hops, unmapped hops, Internet exchange points (IXPs), multi-origin AS prefixes, and siblings—TP addresses (when shared between peering AS neighbors) were recently defined by Zhang et al. [27] as "the last and most difficult cause to be inferred" and as "a huge obstruction towards the accuracy of traceroute measurements."

Several works have attempted to address these issues using heuristic methods, either to explain mismatches between BGP- and traceroute-derived AS paths [8, 27] or to complement the AS-level topology inferred from BGP repositories [4, 8, 13]. However, to the best of our knowledge, only two studies have focused on isolating and studying the phenomenon of TP addresses to quantify their impact, reaching different conclusions. Hyun et al. [14] concluded that TP addresses mostly appear at the border of multi-homed ASes and do not significantly distort AS maps. Conversely, Zhang et al. [27] found that TP addresses cause 60% of mismatches between BGP- and traceroute-derived AS paths, with mismatches affecting 12% to 37% of the paths depending on the vantage point.

In this paper, we propose the first active probing technique to directly detect TP addresses in traceroute IP paths. Our technique is based on the IP prespecified timestamp option [5] and does not require prior knowledge of router interfaces or AS paths provided by BGP or IP-to-AS mapping. Through a large-scale measurement campaign, we evaluate the technique and show that: (i) the same IP address may be a TP or not, depending on both the source and destination of the IP path; (ii) TP addresses affect 17% of the AS links extracted from our dataset; and (iii) they appear in a significant portion of detected AS-level loops. We also compare our technique with the method proposed by Hyun et al. [14], the only other method not using AS paths from BGP. The comparison reveals that only 1.5% of IP addresses detected as TP by our technique are recognized as such by their heuristic, explaining the underestimation of the phenomenon.

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces TP addresses and explains their effect when traceroute is used to infer topological information; Section 3 presents our active probing technique to identify TP addresses in traceroute traces; Section 4 describes the methodology adopted to evaluate the proposed technique and the main findings; and Section 5 concludes the paper.

## 2. Understanding TP Addresses and Their Impact
RFC1812 [5] states that the source address of an ICMP error packet should correspond to the outgoing interface of the ICMP reply, rather than the interface on which the packet triggering the error was received [14]. This behavior can cause a traceroute IP path to include addresses associated with interfaces not included in the actual path traversed. For example, in Figure 1, the trace from S to D contains the sequence (a, b, c) of IP addresses, where a and b are associated with the incoming interfaces of routers A and B, respectively, and c is the interface used by router C to send ICMP replies to the traceroute originator. The IP c is a TP address because it is associated with an interface not effectively traversed by the packets sent from S to D.

The occurrence of TP addresses can significantly impact some traceroute applications, particularly the inference of AS-level links from traceroute traces. As shown in previous works [14, 27], TP addresses may cause the inference of false AS links. In Figure 1, if the IP address b belongs to ASx and c belongs to the ASz addressing space, the IP-to-AS mapping of the trace will induce the inference of a false AS link, i.e., ASx-ASz. Note how the TP address hides ASy, which, though traversed, does not appear in the mapped AS-level trace.

While TP addresses may also impact subnet positioning [26] and alias resolution [25], forcing the adoption of complex heuristics, this paper focuses on their impact on the AS-level links inferred from traceroute traces.

## 3. Detecting TP Addresses
Our technique requires only two probes to determine if an IP address discovered by traceroute lies on the path (OP) or not (TP).

### Basic Principles
Our technique is based on the IP prespecified timestamp (TS) option [23], which allows up to four IP addresses to be specified in a single packet for timestamp requests. We use the notation `PROBE X<ABCD>`, where `PROBE` is the probe type, `X` is the targeted destination, and `ABCD` is the ordered list of prespecified IPs from which a timestamp is requested.

Through a large-scale measurement campaign targeting over 1.7 million IP addresses [10], we observed that most routers (including Cisco devices) insert one timestamp each time the probe passes through the interface associated with the prespecified address. This behavior can be detected by targeting Y with an `ICMPecho<YYYY>` probe. If the reply message contains one timestamp, the interface Y was only traversed when entering the router. If it contains two timestamps, Y was traversed when both entering and leaving the router. Finally, three timestamps indicate that the probe was stamped twice when entering the router but only once when leaving. In these cases, the targeted router exhibits a per-network interface stamping behavior, which can be exploited to determine if a traceroute hop is part of the forward IP path.

### TP Address Detection Technique
To determine if the hop Y discovered by traceroute toward D is a TP address, our technique follows these steps (see Figure 2):
1. Target Y with an `ICMPecho<YYYY>` probe to verify if it is classifiable.
2. If Y is classifiable, target D with a `UDP D<YYYY>` probe. If the TS option brought back into the payload of the ICMP port unreachable message contains at least one timestamp, Y is classified as OP; otherwise, it is a TP address.

The first step is necessary because there are less common router behaviors that may lead to misleading results. A traceroute hop Y is considered non-classifiable if:
- **Private Address (PVT):** Y is part of a private addressing block and may be unreachable by the `ICMPecho` request or employed in different networks along the path.
- **Lack of Reply (NO-REP):** No reply is received to the `ICMPecho<YYYY>` probe.
- **The TS Option is Removed (NO-OPT):** The `ICMPecho` reply message received from Y contains no TS option.
- **Zero Timestamps (NO-TS):** The targeted device ignores the TS option without inserting any timestamp.
- **Four Timestamps (JUN):** The targeted device provides four timestamps, as observed in Juniper routers.

A traceroute hop Y is considered classifiable if it provides 1 to 3 timestamps when directly probed with `ICMPecho<YYYY>`.

We have implemented and made publicly available an enhanced traceroute version, based on `paris-traceroute` [3], which applies our technique to classify the hops discovered along the path toward the destination.

## 4. Experimental Evaluation
This section describes the large-scale measurement campaign conducted to evaluate the proposed technique and the main findings.

### 4.1 Measurement Campaign
To evaluate our technique, we selected over 327,000 destinations in 14,000 ASes, showing stable responsiveness to both ping (according to the PREDICT project [2]) and UDP probes carrying the TS option. We used 53 PlanetLab nodes [6] located in different ASes as vantage points (VPs).

Each node was instructed to:
1. Send UDP probes toward the destinations and select those which reply and preserve the TS option.
2. Launch UDP `paris-traceroute` toward the selected destinations.
3. Launch an `ICMPecho<YYYY>` toward each intermediate hop Y.
4. Select the classifiable hops as those providing 1-3 timestamps.
5. Send an UDP probe toward the traceroute destination, prespecifying each time a different classifiable hop collected on the path.

After removing traces affected by filtering, the final dataset, publicly available, consisted of approximately 12 million traces for a total of about 443,000 addresses.

### 4.2 Main Findings
Since every VP traced IP paths toward the same destinations, a specific IP address may be discovered by multiple VPs, especially for those located close to the destinations. Figure 3 shows the number of distinct VPs that discovered the same IP address: more than 96% of IPs were captured by at least two VPs, while about half were captured by more than 35 VPs.

**Hops Classifiability:** When an IP address is captured by multiple VPs, each node independently states if it is classifiable or not. However, the TS option may trigger the filtering of the `ICMPecho` reply message on some paths, inducing a subset of VPs to consider the targeted device as non-classifiable (NO-REP). Figure 4 reports the number of nodes not receiving replies from a device that successfully replied to at least one VP: only 15% of addresses did not experience in-transit filtering, while on average, 4 VPs were forced by filtering to consider a device as non-classifiable. We conclude that the number of VPs is a key factor for applications based on the TS option [16, 24].

## 5. Conclusion
In this paper, we introduced a novel active probing technique to detect TP addresses in traceroute traces. Our technique, based on the IP timestamp option, does not require prior knowledge of router interfaces or AS paths. Through a large-scale measurement campaign, we demonstrated that TP addresses are common and significantly affect the inference of AS-level links. Our technique outperforms existing heuristic methods and provides a more accurate understanding of the Internet topology.
