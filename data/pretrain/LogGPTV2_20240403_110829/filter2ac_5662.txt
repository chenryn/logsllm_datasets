### Title: BlackHat US-22: Android Universal Root via Exploitation of Mobile GPU and Command Queue Drivers

Rooting modern Android devices using kernel vulnerabilities from an unprivileged process, without relying on hardcoded offsets or addresses, and achieving nearly a 100% success rate, is exceptionally rare. After reporting the in-the-wild CVE-2020-0069 in Mediatek's Command Queue device driver, we conducted a comprehensive security review of ImgTec's PowerVR GPU device driver. During this review, we discovered and reported several such rare vulnerabilities, including GPU CVE-2021-39815. In total, we identified over 35 exploitable bugs.

This talk will primarily focus on GPU hacking. While there have been numerous vulnerability reports for other GPUs like Mali and Adreno in recent years, Google has received only one report concerning ImgTec's PowerVR GPU. This suggests that the security risks associated with ImgTec's PowerVR GPUs have been underexplored, despite ImgTec potentially having the largest GPU market share in the Android ecosystem. Many affordable and popular devices, as well as numerous Chromebooks, use PowerVR GPUs, making the discovered vulnerabilities and exploits cross-platform in nature. Additionally, these findings affect more than ten other OEMs.

Kernel memory management for both CPUs and GPUs is inherently complex, which can lead to unwanted or undefined outcomes. We will delve into the design and implementation of GPU driver technologies, including kernel APIs, memory management, kernel object lifetimes, and the internal libraries of OpenCL. 

We will also highlight the latest SELinux policies designed to limit unprivileged interactions with ImgTec's PowerVR GPUs on devices and discuss how to achieve a stable bypass. The session will include a detailed explanation of the exploit, followed by a live demonstration of rooting a well-known PowerVR device.
