I am trying to define optional externals in an es6 project.  
The feature exists - #339 , but there is no flag that I can set in the
(externals) configuration to make a dependency optional. Digging into the code
I found that optional is a flag checking for reasons, and if every reason's
dependency is marked as optional. But I can't seem to find where it is
defined.
What would be the best way to define an external dependency optional? Have I
missed something and it is possible doing it using configuration?
