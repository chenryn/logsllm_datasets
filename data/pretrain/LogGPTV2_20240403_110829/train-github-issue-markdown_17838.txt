iOS builds require putting dart SDK on system path. If you don't you'll get a
build error.
    pub: command not found
Putting the Dart SDK on the system path isn't something that we are telling
developers to do, rather they're putting it in their .bash_profile. Perhaps we
should give iOS developers a way to specify where their Dart SDK lives (maybe
default to where it is normally in the engine repo?)
