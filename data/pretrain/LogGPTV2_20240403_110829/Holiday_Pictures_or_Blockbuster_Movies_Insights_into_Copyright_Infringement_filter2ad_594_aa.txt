## Abstract

According to copyright holders, One-Click Hosters (OCHs) such as Megaupload are frequently used to host and distribute copyright-infringing content. This has prompted various initiatives by legislators, law enforcement, and content producers. Due to a lack of representative datasets that properly capture private uses of OCHs (e.g., sharing holiday pictures among friends), there are no reliable estimates of the proportion of legitimate and infringing files uploaded to OCHs. This situation leaves the field open to partisan arguments from both copyright owners and OCHs. In this paper, we provide empirical data on the uses and misuses of OCHs by analyzing six large datasets containing file metadata extracted from popular OCHs. We assess the status of these files with regard to copyright infringement and show that at least 26% to 79% of them are potentially infringing. Surprisingly, after the FBI shutdown for alleged copyright infringement, we found Megaupload to have the second-highest proportion of legitimate files in our study.

## 1. Introduction

One-Click Hosters (OCHs) are web-based file hosting services that allow users to upload and share large files. When a file is uploaded, the OCH generates a unique download link. Each file remains private until the corresponding download link is shared with others; hence, OCHs are also known as cyberlockers.

Similar to other file-sharing platforms like peer-to-peer (P2P) systems, OCHs are often misused to illegally distribute copyrighted commercial content. Users upload the latest movies, TV shows, music, ebooks, and software to OCHs and publish the links on public websites (referral or indexing sites) for mass downloading. Consequently, copyright owners accuse several OCHs of being "rogue" sites that facilitate or profit from copyright infringement [19]. Lawsuits are pending against several OCHs, including the criminal indictment against Megaupload, which led to its shutdown in January 2012. In their defense, OCHs point out that their terms of service prohibit uploading copyright-infringing material [4], and they claim that the most downloaded files are open-source software [5] and that they host "over a billion legitimate files" [22].

To date, there is no empirical data on the number of files uploaded to OCHs that infringe copyright. Assessing the situation on OCHs is more challenging than on P2P platforms like BitTorrent because OCHs do not reveal the existence of a file unless the download link is known. Private files, such as personal backups or holiday pictures, may never be published. Therefore, using only public data likely underestimates legitimate uploads on OCHs [1]. An exception is the expert report by Richard Waterman for the plaintiffs in the Disney v. Hotfile lawsuit, which estimated that approximately 90.2% of daily downloads from Hotfile were likely infringing based on internal data [2].

While measuring infringing downloads is important, quantifying infringing uploads is equally crucial. The number of infringing uploads reveals the types of content an OCH attracts, as opposed to the number of downloads. Since private files generate few downloads, the traffic of a modest number of popular infringing files can dominate the traffic of many legitimate files. Our work complements existing research by providing infringement estimates for a range of OCHs not previously covered. For instance, the Megaupload case raised concerns about users losing access to their private files when the service was shut down [10]. We aim to estimate how many legitimate files might have been affected by this event.

Nikiforakis et al. [17] introduced a methodology to predict download links of files hosted on OCHs, even if the links were never published. While their work focused on privacy threats, it did not address copyright infringement. In this paper, we apply Nikiforakis et al.'s methodology to collect file names from Easyshare, Filesonic, Wupload, and a subset of Filefactory over a month, and a random sample of all available files on Megaupload in July 2011. These datasets, independent of where download links were published, allow us to estimate the proportion of infringing uploads globally for each OCH. The datasets contain approximately six million file names and cover some of the largest OCHs at the time of our study.

Using only file metadata (without downloading and opening files) to detect copyright infringement is challenging. File names can be ambiguous, obfuscated, or mislabeled, and there may be cases of fair use. While we cannot detect every instance, we designed our analysis to minimize these impacts. Our approach involves random sampling and manual labeling. We selected 1,000 file names from each OCH, labeled independently by three individuals with experience in file-sharing research, and merged the assessments using a conservative consensus-based algorithm. Additionally, we labeled all 6,000 file names according to nine heuristics capturing typical aspects of infringing or legitimate files and complemented these with five automated heuristics.

This paper presents the first detailed and independent study on the extent of potential copyright infringement in files uploaded to OCHs. Using a unique dataset, we shed light on previously unknown aspects of a common form of abuse of popular web services. Our main findings include:

- Depending on the OCH, at least 26% to 79% of the files appear to be infringing, while up to 14% are likely legitimate. This empirically supports the notion that OCHs are frequently misused for illegal file sharing.
- In our most conservative scenario, around 4.3% of the files hosted on Megaupload were detected as legitimate. We estimate that over 10 million legitimate files were taken offline when Megaupload was shut down.
- Large files are likely to be infringing, whereas small files are more likely to be legitimate. The median file size of the two categories differs by two orders of magnitude, suggesting that the ability to share very large files, a feature advertised by OCHs, is mainly used for infringing content.

## 2. Background: The OCH Ecosystem

One-Click Hosters (OCHs) are web-based file hosting services, typically implemented in a centralized manner with thousands of servers in data centers [2, 16, 20]. There are over 300 OCHs, with Megaupload accounting for approximately 0.8% of all Internet inter-domain traffic in July 2009 [11].

OCHs have various use cases, including storing personal backups, sending large files to friends, and distributing content to larger user bases, including unauthorized distribution of copyrighted works. Some OCHs financially reward uploaders of popular content, which is controversial, especially when the files infringe copyright [8, 12].

Unlike sites like YouTube, OCHs typically do not offer a searchable index of hosted files. A file can be downloaded only if the corresponding download link is known. Uploaders who wish to disseminate their files post the download links on blogs, social networking sites, discussion boards, or specialized search engines like Filestube [2, 12, 15, 16]. Mahanti et al. [15] observed that OCHs receive incoming traffic from up to 8,000 indexing sites, with some ranking among the 100 most popular local websites [12].

Copyright owners scan the Internet for public download links leading to infringing copies of their content and request takedowns under the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). According to the criminal indictment against Megaupload, Warner Bros. had 2,500 infringing links removed daily in September 2009. As of March 29, 2013, the Google Transparency Report lists 1,279,396 URLs leading to Rapidgator that are suppressed due to copyright complaints [4].

## 3. Related Work

There is extensive peer-reviewed research on OCHs [2, 8, 12, 13, 15–17, 20], but only Antoniades et al. [2] specifically investigated whether shared files were infringing. They analyzed the 100 most recent objects on indexing sites and found that 84% to 100% appeared to be copyrighted. While this demonstrates the availability of infringing content, it underestimates legitimate use cases that do not involve publishing download links, such as exchanging private files or storing backups. Later works analyzed file types downloaded from OCHs in network traces [16, 20] or crawls of public indexing sites [15], but did not investigate potential copyright infringement.

Nikiforakis et al. [17] introduced a methodology to discover private files stored on OCHs by guessing download links. Most OCHs use links in the form `http://och/files/{id}/{filename}`, where the filename component is optional. By incrementing or decrementing a known identifier, new valid download links can be generated. Nikiforakis et al. discovered 310,735 unique files during 30 days and inferred the fraction of potentially private and sensitive files, arguing that private files on OCHs were not as private as claimed. In contrast, we analyze uploaded files for potential copyright infringement.

Envisional Ltd., commissioned by NBC Universal [1], estimated the number of infringing files stored on OCHs using an unspecified proprietary methodology. They manually classified a random sample of 2,000 public download links and found 90% to be infringing. However, the coverage of public OCH download links is unclear. In contrast, we extracted download links directly from the largest OCHs, ensuring our results are not biased by unlisted or unpublished links. We also provide details on our classification methods, making our results more traceable.

In his expert declaration in Disney v. Hotfile, Waterman estimated that 90.2% of daily downloads from Hotfile were highly likely infringing. He used file data provided by Hotfile, drew a weighted random sample of 1,750 files, and had each inspected by a copyright lawyer. While Waterman's methodology estimates infringing downloads, we estimate infringing uploads, providing a complementary approach. We cover a wider range of OCHs and provide additional insights beyond copyright infringement.

Other studies estimated the fraction of infringing content shared using BitTorrent (BT) [1, 21]. However, OCHs and BT differ significantly, so the results cannot be directly compared.

## 4. Methodology

Our methodology involves gathering datasets with the names, sizes, and optional descriptions of files uploaded to five large OCHs and a reupload service. For privacy reasons, we do not download any files. We manually classify a random sample of 1,000 file names per dataset and complement this overall assessment with fourteen manual and automated heuristics (defined in Section 4.3) to better illustrate our manual classification.

### 4.1 Data Sets

We base our analysis on file metadata extracted directly from five large OCHs. Additional real-time statistics from the reupload service Undeadlink allow us to validate our classification and heuristics.

#### OCHs

To obtain lists of files uploaded to OCHs, we followed the methodology introduced by Nikiforakis et al. [17] and applied it with variations to five medium-sized and large OCHs. Filefactory, Easy-share, Filesonic, and Wupload used sequential file identifiers with optional file names and were subject to our analysis.
