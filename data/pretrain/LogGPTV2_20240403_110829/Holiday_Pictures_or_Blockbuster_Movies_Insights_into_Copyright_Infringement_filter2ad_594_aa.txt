Abstract. According to copyright holders, One-Click Hosters (OCHs)
such as Megaupload are frequently used to host and distribute copyright
infringing content. This has spurred numerous initiatives by legislators,
law enforcement and content producers. Due to a lack of representative
data sets that properly capture private uses of OCHs (such as sharing
holiday pictures among friends), to date, there are no reliable estimates
of the proportion of legitimate and infringing ﬁles being uploaded to
OCHs. This situation leaves the ﬁeld to the partisan arguments brought
forward by copyright owners and OCHs. In this paper, we provide em-
pirical data about the uses and misuses of OCHs by analysing six large
data sets containing ﬁle metadata that we extracted from a range of pop-
ular OCHs. We assess the status of these ﬁles with regard to copyright
infringement and show that at least 26 % to 79 % of them are potentially
infringing. Perhaps surprising after the shutdown by the FBI for alleged
copyright infringement, we found Megaupload to have the second highest
proportion of legitimate ﬁles in our study.

Introduction
One-Click Hosters (OCHs) are web-based ﬁle hosting services that allow users to
upload and share large ﬁles. When a ﬁle is uploaded, the OCH generates a unique
download link for the ﬁle. Each ﬁle remains private until the corresponding
download link is communicated to third parties; this is why OCHs are sometimes
also referred to as cyberlockers.
Similar to other ﬁle sharing platforms such as peer-to-peer (P2P) systems,
OCHs are being (mis)used by certain groups of users to illegally distribute copy-
righted commercial content. These users upload the latest movies, TV shows,
music, ebooks, and software to OCHs and publish the corresponding links on
public web sites (so-called referral or indexing sites) for everyone to download.
On this account, copyright owners accuse several OCHs of being “rogue” sites

that facilitate or even proﬁt from copyright infringement [19]. Lawsuits are pend-
ing against several OCHs, such as the criminal indictment against Megaupload1
that led to the shutdown of the site in January 2012. In their defence, the OCHs
regularly point out that their terms of service forbid uploading copyright infring-
ing material [4], and they claim that the most downloaded ﬁles are open source
software [5], and that they host “over a billion legitimate ﬁles” [22].
To date, there is no empirical data about how many ﬁles uploaded to OCHs
infringe copyright. The situation on OCHs is much more challenging to assess
than on P2P-based platforms such as BitTorrent (BT) [1, 21] because OCHs do
not reveal the existence of a ﬁle unless the corresponding download link is known.
Download links for private ﬁles might never be published, such as when an OCH
is used to store personal backups or to share holiday pictures with friends and
family. Therefore, using only public data (as done in [1,2]) likely underestimates
legitimate uploads on OCHs [1]. An exception is the expert report2 produced
by Richard Waterman for the plaintiﬀs in the Disney v. Hotﬁle lawsuit. Based
on internal data obtained from Hotﬁle, Waterman estimated that approximately
90.2 % of the daily downloads from Hotﬁle were highly likely infringing copyright.
While the metric of infringing downloads has its merits when aiming to mea-
sure the illegal distribution of copyrighted works, it is equally important to
quantify the number of infringing uploads when studying the role of OCHs in
the illegal ﬁle sharing ecosystem. In particular, the number of infringing uploads
reveals what types of content an OCH attracts, as opposed to how many down-
loaders the uploaded content attracts. In fact, since private ﬁles are unlikely to
generate many downloads, the traﬃc of even a modest number of popular in-
fringing ﬁles can easily dominate the traﬃc of a potentially much higher number
of legitimate ﬁles. Our work complements the existing body of research with a
diﬀerent view on copyright infringement on OCHs, and introduces infringement
estimates for a range of OCHs not covered before. The Megaupload case, for
instance, brought complaints in mainstream media about users who lost access
to their private ﬁles when the service was shut down by the FBI [10]. We aim at
estimating how many legitimate ﬁles might have been aﬀected by this event.
Nikiforakis et al. [17] introduced a methodology to guess or predict download
links of ﬁles hosted on OCHs even when a download link had never been pub-
lished. While the authors used their methodology to estimate how many uploads
were private and to alert users and OCHs to this privacy threat, their work was
not concerned with the quantiﬁcation of possible copyright infringement. In this
paper, we apply the methodology by Nikiforakis et al. to collect the names of all
ﬁles uploaded to Easyshare, Filesonic and Wupload over a duration of 48 hours,
a subset of the ﬁles uploaded to Filefactory during one month, and a random
sample of all available ﬁles on Megaupload in July 2011. These data sets are in-

dependent of whether and where download links were published; therefore, they
allow us to estimate the proportion of infringing uploads globally for each OCH
and unbiased by any user community. The data sets contain approximately six
million ﬁle names and cover some of the largest OCHs at the time of our study.
The methodology used in this work could discover ﬁles even if they were not
intended to be public. We understand that such ﬁles can contain sensitive private
information. Therefore, we carefully designed a privacy-preserving measurement
protocol. As a core principle, we did not download any ﬁle contents and analysed
only ﬁle metadata that was provided by the OCHs’ APIs. Section 4.2 contains
a detailed discussion of ethical considerations pertaining to our measurements.
Using only ﬁle metadata (without downloading and opening a ﬁle) to detect
whether the ﬁle might infringe copyright is a challenging task. File names can
be ambiguous or obfuscated; ﬁles can be mislabelled and contain fake data or
malware, and there may be cases of fair use where excerpts of copyrighted con-
tent are legitimately used for purposes such as educational or scientiﬁc work.
While we cannot detect every instance of these cases, we designed our analysis
so as to minimise their impact on our ﬁnal results. Our approach is based on
random sampling and manual labelling. That is, we selected representative ran-
dom samples of 1,000 ﬁle names from each OCH and had each ﬁle name labelled
independently by three diﬀerent individuals with prior experience in ﬁle sharing
research. A ﬁle name could be labelled as legitimate, infringing, or unknown
(when there was not enough information in the ﬁle name to make a decision).
The assessments were then merged according to a conservative consensus-based
algorithm. In order to provide insights into why a ﬁle was labelled as probably
infringing or legitimate, all 6,000 ﬁle names in the samples were additionally la-
belled according to nine heuristics that captured diﬀerent typical aspects of the
names of infringing or legitimate ﬁles. We complemented these manual eﬀorts
with ﬁve automated heuristics.
This paper presents the ﬁrst detailed and independent study about the extent
of potential copyright infringement in the ﬁles being uploaded to OCHs. Using
a unique data set, we shed light on previously unknown aspects of a common
form of abuse of popular web services. Our main ﬁndings can be summarised as
follows:
– Depending on the OCH, at least 26 % to 79 % of the ﬁles appear to be
infringing copyright, while we could classify only up to 14 % of the ﬁles as
likely legitimate. In other words, our ﬁndings empirically support the folk
wisdom that OCHs are frequently being misused for illegal ﬁle sharing.
– In our most conservative scenario, around 4.3 % of the ﬁles hosted on Megau-
pload were detected as legitimate. We estimate that when Megaupload was
forced to shut down, more than 10 million legitimate ﬁles were taken oﬄine.
– Large ﬁles are likely to be infringing, whereas small ﬁles are most likely le-
gitimate. The median ﬁle size of the two categories diﬀers by two orders of
magnitude. Apparently, the ability to share very large ﬁles, which is speciﬁ-
cally advertised by OCHs, is mainly used for infringing content.

2 Background: The OCH Ecosystem
One-Click Hosters are web-based ﬁle hosting services. They are typically imple-
mented in a centralised fashion with thousands of servers located in comput-
ing centres [2, 16, 20]. According to previous studies, there are more than 300
OCHs [12]. Labovitz et al. [11] reported that Megaupload accounted for approx-
imately 0.8 % of all Internet inter-domain traﬃc in July 2009.
There is a wide variety of use cases for OCHs. They can be used to store
personal backups, to send potentially large ﬁles to friends, and to distribute con-
tent to larger user bases—including the unauthorised distribution of copyrighted
works. Some OCHs ﬁnancially reward the uploaders of popular content, which
is controversial especially when those ﬁles infringe copyright [8, 12].
In contrast to sites such as YouTube, OCHs typically do not oﬀer a searchable
index of the hosted ﬁles. A ﬁle can be downloaded only when the corresponding
download link is known. Therefore, uploaders who wish to disseminate their ﬁles
post the download links on blogs, social networking sites, discussion boards, or
they even submit their links to specialised search engines such as Filestube [2,12,
15, 16]. Mahanti et al. [15] observed OCHs were receiving incoming traﬃc from
up to 8,000 indexing sites. Single indexing sites can be very popular with users
and easily rank among the 100 most popular local web sites [12].
Copyright owners are known to scan the Internet for public download links
leading to infringing copies of their content and to request that the corresponding
OCHs take down those links under the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act
(DMCA). According to the criminal indictment3 against Megaupload, Warner
Bros. had 2,500 infringing links removed from Megaupload on a daily basis in
September 2009. As of 29 March 2013, the Google Transparency Report4 refers
to 1,279,396 URLs leading to the OCH Rapidgator that are suppressed from
Google search results due to copyright complaints.
3 Related Work
There is a wide body of peer-reviewed research in the area of OCHs [2, 8, 12, 13,
15–17, 20]. However, only Antoniades et al. [2] speciﬁcally investigated whether
the shared ﬁles were infringing copyright. They based their analysis on the 100
most recent objects published on a range of indexing sites and found that be-
tween 84 % and 100 % of these ﬁles appeared to be copyrighted. While such
a methodology demonstrates the availability of infringing content on OCHs, it
is less suitable for assessing the relative amount of copyright infringement. It
tends to underestimate legitimate use cases that do not involve publishing the
download links, such as exchanging holiday pictures and other private ﬁles, or
storing backups. Later works analysed the content types of ﬁles downloaded from

OCHs as seen in network traces gathered at university networks [16, 20] or in
crawls of public indexing sites [15], but potential copyright infringement was not
investigated.
Nikiforakis et al. [17] introduced a methodology to discover private ﬁles stored
on OCHs by guessing the associated download links. Most OCHs use download
links in the form http://och/files/{id}/{filename}, where the ﬁle name
component is often optional. When such an OCH assigns sequential identiﬁers,
incrementing or decrementing a known identiﬁer yields a new valid download
link. Nikiforakis et al. applied this methodology to a number of unidentiﬁed
OCHs and discovered 310,735 unique ﬁles during 30 days. The authors inferred
the fraction of potentially private and sensitive ﬁles and argued that private ﬁles
on the aﬀected OCHs were not as private as the OCHs claimed. In contrast to
their work, we analyse uploaded ﬁles for potential copyright infringement.
In a report commissioned by NBC Universal [1], Envisional Ltd estimated
the number of infringing ﬁles stored on OCHs. Using an unspeciﬁed proprietary
methodology, Envisional crawled the Internet for OCH download links. They
manually classiﬁed a random sample of 2,000 public download links and found
90 % of them to be infringing copyright. However, it is not clear from the report
what coverage of public OCH download links Envisional achieved. In contrast,
we extracted download links directly from some of the largest OCHs; therefore,
our results are not biased by the fact that some download links were not found
by a crawler, or not even published at all. Furthermore, we provide details about
how we classiﬁed the ﬁles, making our results more traceable.
In his expert declaration in Disney v. Hotﬁle, Waterman outlined the method-
ology that led him to estimate that 90.2 % of the daily downloads from Hotﬁle
were highly likely infringing: File data was provided by Hotﬁle, a sample of
1,750 ﬁles was drawn at random (weighted by the number of downloads), and
each ﬁle in the sample was opened and inspected by a copyright lawyer. While
Waterman’s methodology estimates infringing downloads, we estimate infring-
ing uploads, which is a complementary approach. Furthermore, we cover a wider
range of OCHs, highlighting the diﬀerences in the data sets, and we provide
additional insights into various metrics beyond copyright infringement.
Other studies estimated the fraction of infringing content shared using Bit-
Torrent (BT) [1, 21]. However, OCHs and BT diﬀer signiﬁcantly from both a
technical and administrative point of view, so that the results cannot be com-
pared directly.
4 Methodology
At a high level, our methodology consists of gathering data sets with the names,
sizes and optional descriptions of ﬁles uploaded to ﬁve large OCHs and a reu-
pload service. For privacy reasons, we do not download any of these ﬁles. We
manually classify a random sample of 1,000 ﬁle names per data set and comple-
ment this overall assessment of copyright infringement with fourteen manual and
automated heuristics (as deﬁned in Section 4.3) to better illustrate our manual
classiﬁcation.
