titleblackhat:asia-20 The Black Hat NOC: Greatest Hits and Holy...Cows
This session will be a look into the most interesting things seen and learned within the Black Hat NOC, by two of the guys that have been running that circus for nearly two decades. It won't just be attacks and failures, I mean, it will be that, but it'll also be so much more. Come see how the NOC has been adjusted, adapted, and reinvented as the industry, and the potential threats have changed over the years. What technologies or trends worked for us, what didn't, and what decisions were our best and worst? Maybe you'll get some ideas for your NOC or SOC. Maybe you'll walk away shocked and appalled. Maybe. But you'll definitely walk away entertained.
