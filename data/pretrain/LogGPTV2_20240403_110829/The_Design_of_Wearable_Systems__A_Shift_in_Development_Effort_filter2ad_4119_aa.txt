Abstract
This paper describes a design process for custom wear-
able systems produced in an academic setting. A set of 245
wearable design defects from two distinct periods separated
by six years in time is presented. These data identify aspects
of the process which require signiﬁcant developer effort. We
show this effort using several views of the data, including
time spent, design region affected, and distribution under
an Orthogonal Defect Classiﬁcation scheme.
A comparison of defect attribute distributions across the
two separate design periods is given. The results show
that growing interoperability requirements are increasing
design complexity, and inducing greater debugging effort.
In addition, the combination of increasing pin counts and
decreasing physical dimensions produce a higher rate of
critical defects (i.e., those that require major physical modi-
ﬁcations before debugging can continue). Finally, although
the nature of the defects themselves has changed with time,
the mechanisms used to discover defects have remained rel-
atively constant.
1. Introduction
The design requirements for a wearable system [3] are
a set of simultaneous constraints on electronics, software,
mechanics, and usability. It is sometimes difﬁcult to sat-
isfy these requirements using only off-the-shelf componen-
try. For these cases, some amount of custom design, imple-
mentation, and testing must take place.
This paper examines two periods of wearable system de-
sign at Carnegie Mellon, 1994–1996 and 2000–2002. We
observe that not all of the increased capabilities of the more
recent systems were “free” to the designers. Moore’s Law
has helped in some areas, such as memory density. Coun-
tering these gains, however, are interconnect and interop-
erability requirements, such as peripheral I/O standards and

operating system support for new hardware. The design im-
pact of these requirements can range from increased com-
plexity in an existing subsystem, to the addition of entirely
new subsystems. In some cases, there may be no prior expe-
rience in combining particular subsystems; this introduces
risk which must be considered by project planners.
Section 2 summarizes three wearable system designs.
The concurrent design process for these systems is pre-
sented in Section 3, with empirical observations showing
the time spent in each phase of the process. Using defect
discoveries as indicators of developer effort, Section 4 de-
composes observed defects by affected subsystem and de-
sign discipline. In Section 5, Orthogonal Defect Classiﬁ-
cation is introduced, and the defect data for two periods of
wearable design are compared. Section 6 concludes with
some interpretation of the results.
The ﬁrst wearable system design we present

is the
V¯u·Man 2R computer [6, 8], developed in 1994 as a
ruggedized version of an earlier design. V¯u·Man 2R was
deployed as a maintenance assistant, providing custom hy-
pertext documentation to vehicle inspectors. The industrial
design of V¯u·Man 2R featured an environmentally-sealed
housing, a machined aluminum frame, and a novel input
method consisting of a dial and buttons.
Closely following V¯u·Man 2R was the general-purpose
Navigator 2 system [2], designed in 1995. High-integration
modules such as the Epson Cardio were used to absorb
previously separate components such as the microproces-
sor, memory, and some I/O. Designed for aircraft main-
tenance applications, Navigator 2 included an aluminum
frame which also served as a heat spreader. The use of
a commodity operating system permitted easy experimen-
tation with PCMCIA spread-spectrum radios and speech
recognition engines.

puting. The system includes a number of standard intercon-
nects, custom modular batteries, and an IBM Digital Visual
Interface head-mounted display. Spot runs ARM Linux, and
supports the variety of programs available for that operating
environment. To date there have been three revisions of the
basic Spot design (“R1,” “R2,” and “R3”), with the most
recent design activity having been performed in 2002.
Table 1 summarizes the design features of V¯u·Man 2R,
Navigator 2, and Spot. The most recent design offers im-
proved I/O, memory, and computational features over the
earlier systems, but Table 1 does not capture the process by
which these gains were achieved. Some of the given ad-
vances are attributable to the availability of higher-density
or higher-performance components. Others, such as the re-
ductions in mass and volume, are partly due to material dif-
ferences – such as the lack of a ruggedized chassis – and or-
ganizational changes – such as the modularization of batter-
ies. Many improvements, however, were achieved through
the use of a higher-complexity electronic design.
Table 2 captures several aspects of the V¯u·Man 2R, Nav-
igator 2, and Spot designs which reﬂect electronic complex-
ity. For example, there are enough components on Spot to
ﬁll both V¯u·Man 2R printed circuit boards; in fact, the Spot
mechanical design was based on a two-board organization.
To avoid consuming board space with a large connector, a
ﬂexible hinge was created in the middle of the PCB by sub-
stituting Capton for two of the ﬁberglass layers. This adds
routing constraints and fabrication complexity.
As another example, the number of connectors exposed
outside of the housing is increasing with time. External con-
nectors may require electrostatic discharge suppression, and
introduce more rigid layout and routing constraints than in-
ternal connectors. Also, most external interfaces must be
checked for conformance with some published standard, as
the range of devices which will attach to these connectors
may be large.
Flexible I/O and low-power design seem to conﬂict in
the area of power supply selection. For this reason, a range

warrant special voltage regulators; the microprocessor core
supply is programmable to decrease energy consumption as
speed decreases, and the analog audio section — not present
on the other systems — has a dedicated low-noise linear
regulator.
3. Design Process
Wearable system design is a multidisciplinary process
which incorporates electronics, mechanics or industrial de-
sign, and software. As has been demonstrated with earlier
wearable systems, some of these design activities can pro-
ceed concurrently [7]. Figure 1 illustrates the major activi-
ties of the Spot R1 design process. In addition to electronic,
mechanical, and software design, Figure 1 also identiﬁes the
time required for manufacturing, which is non-trivial for a
modern design.

The design process may be organized into four major
phases: Design, Bringup, Integration, and Operation. The
Design phase includes system decomposition, generation of
design documents such as schematics and drawings, and
peer design review.
In Bringup, the design is realized
through implementation, which includes manufacturing and
software development. Bringup also includes some basic
hardware tests, which become more important as electronic
complexity increases. The Integration phase captures the
merging of design components from different disciplines;
for example, an operating system might be used to fully ex-
ercise a hardware subsystem, or a housing might be com-
bined with a populated PCB for ﬁt checks. When the inte-
grated system satisﬁes some quality measure, it is released
to the ﬁeld in the Operation phase for actual use.
In a wearable system development effort, it is useful to
be able to predict the amount of time which will be con-
sumed by Design, Bringup, and Integration. This is impor-
tant for budget reasons as well as for scheduling the avail-
ability of ﬁnished systems to users. Some factors which
contribute to development time are predictable or control-
lable; for example, manufacturing follows a simple function
relating cost and delivery speed. Other factors, such as elec-
tronic complexity, introduce delays in the form of defects,
which can be difﬁcult to anticipate.
Figure 2 plots the cumulative defect count as a function
of calendar time for three revisions of the Spot design. The
defect discoveries are not uniformly distributed in time. In
general, a burst of defects are discovered during engineer-
ing reviews in the Design phase. Following this, the de-
sign is sent for layout, routing, fabrication, and assembly;
during these activities, relatively few new defects surface.
Only when the ﬁnished boards return from manufacturing in
