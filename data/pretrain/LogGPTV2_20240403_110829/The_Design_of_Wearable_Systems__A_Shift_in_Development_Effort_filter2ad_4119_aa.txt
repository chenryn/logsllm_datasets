## Abstract
This paper presents a design process for custom wearable systems developed in an academic setting. We analyze 245 design defects from two distinct periods separated by six years. These data highlight the aspects of the process that require significant developer effort. We present several views of the data, including time spent, affected design regions, and defect distribution under an Orthogonal Defect Classification (ODC) scheme.

A comparison of defect attribute distributions across the two design periods reveals that increasing interoperability requirements are driving up design complexity and debugging effort. Additionally, the combination of higher pin counts and smaller physical dimensions is leading to a higher rate of critical defects, which require major physical modifications before debugging can continue. Despite these changes, the mechanisms used to discover defects have remained relatively constant over time.

## 1. Introduction
The design of a wearable system involves simultaneous constraints on electronics, software, mechanics, and usability. Off-the-shelf components often cannot meet all these requirements, necessitating custom design, implementation, and testing.

This paper examines two periods of wearable system design at Carnegie Mellon University: 1994–1996 and 2000–2002. We observe that not all the increased capabilities of the more recent systems were "free" to the designers. While Moore's Law has helped in some areas, such as memory density, interconnect and interoperability requirements, like peripheral I/O standards and operating system support for new hardware, have introduced additional complexity. This complexity can range from increased intricacy in existing subsystems to the addition of entirely new subsystems. In some cases, there may be no prior experience in combining particular subsystems, introducing risk that must be considered by project planners.

Section 2 summarizes three wearable system designs. Section 3 presents the concurrent design process for these systems, with empirical observations showing the time spent in each phase. Section 4 decomposes observed defects by affected subsystem and design discipline. Section 5 introduces Orthogonal Defect Classification and compares defect data for the two periods. Section 6 concludes with an interpretation of the results.

## 2. Wearable System Descriptions

### V¯u·Man 2R
Developed in 1994, V¯u·Man 2R was a ruggedized version of an earlier design, deployed as a maintenance assistant providing custom hypertext documentation to vehicle inspectors. It featured an environmentally-sealed housing, a machined aluminum frame, and a novel input method consisting of a dial and buttons.

### Navigator 2
Designed in 1995, Navigator 2 was a general-purpose system for aircraft maintenance applications. It used high-integration modules like the Epson Cardio, which combined the microprocessor, memory, and some I/O. The system included an aluminum frame that also served as a heat spreader and supported PCMCIA spread-spectrum radios and speech recognition engines.

### Spot
Started in 2000, Spot is a general-purpose computer built to support research in mobile networking, interaction design, and energy-aware computing. It includes standard interconnects, custom modular batteries, and an IBM Digital Visual Interface head-mounted display. Spot runs ARM Linux and supports a variety of programs. There have been three revisions of the basic Spot design ("R1," "R2," and "R3"), with the most recent design activity in 2002.

Table 1 summarizes the design features of V¯u·Man 2R, Navigator 2, and Spot. Table 2 captures several aspects of the electronic design complexity, such as the number of PCBs, ICs, and connectors.

## 3. Design Process
Wearable system design is a multidisciplinary process involving electronics, mechanics, and software. Some design activities can proceed concurrently. Figure 1 illustrates the major activities of the Spot R1 design process, including manufacturing, which is non-trivial for modern designs.

The design process can be divided into four major phases: Design, Bringup, Integration, and Operation.

- **Design Phase:** Includes system decomposition, generation of design documents, and peer design review.
- **Bringup Phase:** Involves implementation, including manufacturing and software development, and basic hardware tests.
- **Integration Phase:** Merges design components from different disciplines, such as using an operating system to exercise a hardware subsystem or combining a housing with a populated PCB for fit checks.
- **Operation Phase:** Releases the integrated system to the field for actual use.

In a wearable system development effort, it is crucial to predict the time required for Design, Bringup, and Integration. This is important for budgeting and scheduling. Factors like manufacturing follow predictable functions, while others, such as electronic complexity, introduce delays through defects, which can be challenging to anticipate.

Figure 2 shows the cumulative defect count as a function of calendar time for three revisions of the Spot design. Defect discoveries are not uniformly distributed; they typically occur in bursts during engineering reviews in the Design phase. After this, few new defects surface during layout, routing, fabrication, and assembly. Only when the finished boards return from manufacturing do more defects emerge.
