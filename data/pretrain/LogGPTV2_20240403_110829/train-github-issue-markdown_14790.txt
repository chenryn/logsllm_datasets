I'm working on an application with many different code paths that load
textures and I've patched the WebGLRenderer to cache textures also on the GL
level, so that `uploadTexture` and `onTextureDispose` use a dictionary to see
if a texture has aleady been uploaded or are no longer used, which can reduce
VRAM usage and does not need sweeping changes in other parts of the code.
Is that a useful thing for others, too? Or is there side-effects I'm missing /
is it too specific to be useful within three.js?
