## Description
I attempted to generate the documentation using `make docs` in the root directory and `make html` in the `/docs` directory. However, I encountered the following error:

```
Exception occurred:
  File "/usr/lib/python3.8/site-packages/docutils/nodes.py", line 567, in __getitem__
    return self.attributes[key]
KeyError: 'refdoc'
The full traceback has been saved in /tmp/sphinx-err-qa973efh.log, if you want to report the issue to the developers.
Please also report this if it was a user error, so that a better error message can be provided next time.
A bug report can be filed in the tracker at <insert_tracker_URL_here>. Thanks!
make[1]: *** [Makefile:55: html] Error 2
make[1]: Leaving directory '/home/lash/src/ext/python/celery/docs'
make: *** [Makefile:76: Documentation] Error 2
```

This issue was observed with both the `master@f2ddd894c32f642a20f03b805b97e460f4fb3b4f` and `v4.3.0` branches. The environment used includes `python@3.8.1`, `sphinx@2.2.1`, and `sphinx-celery@2.0.0`.

## Suggestions
- [ ] Investigate the cause of the `KeyError: 'refdoc'` and provide a more informative error message.
- [ ] Ensure that the documentation build process is compatible with the specified versions of Python, Sphinx, and sphinx-celery.
- [ ] Consider adding additional checks or fallbacks in the code to handle missing attributes gracefully.
