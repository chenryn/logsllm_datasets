User: I use OS X (Mountain Lion) and ZSH. I can use easy_install to install some python packages but if I want to use the command in my ZSH afterwards I just get something like this:

zsh: command not found: virtualenv

Have I forgotten to include anything to my $PATH or so? Hope you can help me out :)
Assistant: Thanks for the hint @Evert I had to add /usr/local/share/python to my $PATH and now everything works fine.
