records for these numbers and ﬁnd that many of them
initiate a vast amount of SMS trafﬁc to foreign countries,
such as Canada and Jamaica, etc., and hence no CDR
record has been collected to trigger Greystar detection.
Low volume. We ﬁnd around 27% of the missed de-
tections have accessed less than 50 recipients during the
observation period. We study the text content inside the
victim spam reports to understand the root cause of these
missed detections. The most popular text content are
party advertisements and promotions from local restau-
rants. Users are likely to have registered with these mer-
chants in the past and hence received ads from them. For
the rest of the numbers, we ﬁnd many send out spam
messages to advertise mobile apps and premium SMS
services. From the users’ comments posted on online fo-
rums and social media sites [14,15], we ﬁnd two of the
advertised apps are messenger/dating apps which have
issues with their default personal settings. Without man-
ual correction, these apps, once initiated, will send out
friend requests to a few random users of the apps. Spam
messages from the remaining numbers are also likely to
be sent out without users’ consent, especially the ones
that broadcast premium SMS services. We suspect they
are caused by apps abusing permissions or even behav-
iors of malware apps. For example, one app advertised
by spam is reported to contain malware that sent SMS
text to the contact list on the infected device, where the
text contains a URL for downloading that malware.
High volume. The rest of the phone numbers send SMS
to a large number of recipients. From the reported spam
text, we ﬁnd 7.1% of them belong to legitimate advertiser
who broadcast to registerred customers and are somehow
reported by the recipients. For the rest of numbers, we
ﬁnd their spam topics are quite different from those of
the detected ones. In particular, 11% of these numbers
are associated with adult sites or hotlines, in comparison
to only 0.06% among the detected numbers. Meanwhile,
17.6% of them advertise local shopping deals, as op-
posed to only 2.1% among the detected ones. Such dif-
ference suggests that these spam victims somehow gave
out their phone numbersto spammers, e.g., while visiting
malicious sites to register services or to purchase prod-
ucts. In addition, we extract the voice call history associ-
ated with these high volume candidates. Interestingly, we

ﬁnd that about 4% of these numbers have initiated phone
calls to many terminating numbers in the past. We sus-
pect that these spammers employ auto-dialers to harvest
active phone numbers (i.e., the ones that have answered
the calls) from the phone number space. With the list
of active phone numbers, spammers can send spam more
effectively and avoid detection in the mean time.
Admittedly, there are spam numbers in these three
categories that are missed by Greystar because they are
equippedwith a target numberlist obtained throughauto-
dialing or social engineering techniques (for example,
accurate target lists can potentially be obtained by ap-
plying techniques discussed in [16]). SMS trafﬁc from
these users is not differentiable from that of the legiti-
mate users. However, we emphasize that these missed
detections only account for less than 9% of all the spam
numbers detected and they will not have a signiﬁcant im-
pact on the efﬁcacy of Greystar for reducing the overall
spam trafﬁc. In fact, we ﬁnd that, on average, the missed
detections sent 37% less spam messages in comparison
to the spam numbers detected by Greystar. On the other
hand, we do see the needs of combining Greystar and
other methods to build a more robust defense solution.
For example, many malicious activities can be better de-
tected by correlating different channels (e.g., voice, SMS
and data). Meanwhile, cellular carriers can collaborate
with mobile marketplace to detect and control suspicious
apps that can potentially initiate spam.
8 Related Work
The demographic features and network behaviors of
SMS spammers were analyzed in [6]. [16] investigated
the security impact of SMS messages and discussed the
potential of denying voice service by sending SMS to
large and accurate phone hitlists at a high rate. Mean-
while, [16] also discussed several ways of harvesting ac-
tive phone numbers, which can potentially be employed
by SMS spammers to generate accurate target number
lists to launch spam campaign more efﬁciently and to
evade detection. Similar short message services carried
by the data channel were also studied. For example, [17]
characterized spam campaigns from “wall” messages be-
tween Facebook users. [18–21] analyzed Twitter spam.
[22,23] studied talkback spam on weblogs. Meanwhile,
akin to SMS spammers, the behaviors of email spam-
mers were characterized in [24–27]. In comparison, we
not only study the strategies of SMS spammers but also
propose an effective spam detection solution based on
our analysis.
In addition to the victim spam reports mentioned ear-
lier, network behaviors of spammers, e.g., sending pat-
terns, have been used in SMS spam detection, such
as [28]. Similar network statistics based methods de-
signed for email spam detection can also be applied for
identifying SMS spam, such as [29–32]. However, these
methods often suffer from large false positive rates, be-
cause many legitimate customers can exhibit SMS send-
ing patterns similar to those of spammers. In contrast,
Greystar utilizes a novel concept of grey phone space
to detect spam numbers, which yields an extremely low
false alarm rate.
Some systems have been developed in the form of
smartphone apps to classify spam messages on user mo-
bile devices [33–35]. However, not all mobile devices
support executing such apps. Furthermore, from a user’s
perspective, this method is a late defense as the spam
message has already arrived on his/her device and the
user may already be charged for the spam message.
Moreover, the high volume of spam messages that have
already traversed the cellular network may have resulted
in congestion and other adverse network performance
impacts. Greystar is deployed inside the carrier network
and hence do not have these drawbacks. As we have seen
in Section 7, Greystar can quickly detect spam numbers
once they start spamming and hence signiﬁcantly reduce
spam trafﬁc volume in the network.
Similar to our work, many works have leveraged un-
wanted trafﬁc for anomaly detection, such as Internet
dark space [13, 36], grey space [12], honeynet [37, 38]
and failed DNS trafﬁc [39], etc. We are the ﬁrst to ad-
vance the notion of grey phone space and propose a novel
statistical method for identifying SMS spam using grey
phone space.
9 Conclusion and Future Work
In this paper, we presented the design of Greystar, an in-
novative system for fast and accurate detection of SMS
spam numbers. Greystar monitors a set of grey phone
numbers, which signify impending spam activities tar-
geting a large number of mobile users, and employs an
advanced statistical model for detecting spam numbers
according to their interactions with grey phone numbers.
Using ﬁve months of SMS call detail records collected
from a large cellular network in the US, we conducted
extensive evaluation of Greystar in terms of the detec-
tion accuracy and speed, and demonstrated the great po-
tential of Greystar for reducing SMS spam trafﬁc in the
network.
Our future work will focus on applying Greystar to de-
tect other suspicious activities in cellular networks, such
as telemarketing campaigns. Meanwhile, we will corre-
late Greystar detection results with cellular data trafﬁc to
detect malware engaged in such spamming activities.
