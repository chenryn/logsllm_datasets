### Analysis of Missed Detections and Spam Traffic

**International SMS Traffic:**
Upon examining the records for these numbers, we discovered that many of them generate a significant amount of SMS traffic to foreign countries, such as Canada and Jamaica. As a result, no Call Detail Record (CDR) has been collected to trigger Greystar detection. This lack of CDRs is a primary reason for missed detections.

**Low Volume Spammers:**
Approximately 27% of the missed detections have sent messages to fewer than 50 recipients during the observation period. To understand the root cause of these missed detections, we analyzed the text content in the victim spam reports. The most common types of messages were party advertisements and promotions from local restaurants. Users likely registered with these merchants in the past, leading to the receipt of such ads. For the remaining numbers, we found that many were sending spam messages to advertise mobile apps and premium SMS services. According to user comments on online forums and social media sites [14,15], two of the advertised apps were messenger/dating apps with issues in their default personal settings. Without manual correction, these apps would send friend requests to random users. Additionally, spam messages from other numbers were likely sent without user consent, especially those promoting premium SMS services. We suspect these are caused by apps abusing permissions or even malware behavior. For instance, one app advertised via spam was reported to contain malware that sent SMS texts to the contact list on the infected device, containing a URL for downloading the malware.

**High Volume Spammers:**
The rest of the phone numbers sent SMS to a large number of recipients. From the reported spam text, 7.1% of them were legitimate advertisers broadcasting to registered customers but were somehow reported by the recipients. For the remaining numbers, their spam topics differed significantly from those detected. Specifically, 11% of these numbers were associated with adult sites or hotlines, compared to only 0.06% among the detected ones. Additionally, 17.6% advertised local shopping deals, as opposed to only 2.1% among the detected numbers. This difference suggests that these spam victims may have inadvertently provided their phone numbers to spammers, for example, while visiting malicious sites to register services or purchase products. Furthermore, we extracted the voice call history associated with these high-volume candidates. Interestingly, about 4% of these numbers had initiated calls to many terminating numbers in the past. We suspect that these spammers use auto-dialers to harvest active phone numbers (i.e., those that have answered the calls) from the phone number space. With a list of active phone numbers, spammers can send spam more effectively and avoid detection.

**Spam Numbers Equipped with Target Lists:**
Admittedly, some spam numbers in these three categories are missed by Greystar because they use target number lists obtained through auto-dialing or social engineering techniques. The SMS traffic from these users is indistinguishable from that of legitimate users. However, it is important to note that these missed detections account for less than 9% of all detected spam numbers and do not significantly impact Greystar's effectiveness in reducing overall spam traffic. In fact, on average, the missed detections sent 37% fewer spam messages compared to the spam numbers detected by Greystar. Nonetheless, there is a need to combine Greystar with other methods to build a more robust defense solution. For example, correlating different channels (e.g., voice, SMS, and data) can better detect malicious activities. Cellular carriers can also collaborate with mobile marketplaces to detect and control suspicious apps that could initiate spam.

### Related Work

**Demographic and Network Behaviors:**
Previous studies have analyzed the demographic features and network behaviors of SMS spammers [6]. [16] investigated the security impact of SMS messages and discussed the potential for denying voice service by sending SMS to large and accurate phone hitlists at a high rate. [16] also discussed several methods for harvesting active phone numbers, which can be used by spammers to generate accurate target number lists for more efficient spam campaigns and to evade detection. Similar short message services carried by the data channel have also been studied. For example, [17] characterized spam campaigns from "wall" messages between Facebook users, and [18-21] analyzed Twitter spam. [22,23] studied talkback spam on weblogs. Meanwhile, email spammers' behaviors have been characterized in [24-27]. In comparison, our work not only studies the strategies of SMS spammers but also proposes an effective spam detection solution based on our analysis.

**Network Behavior-Based Detection:**
In addition to the victim spam reports, network behaviors of spammers, such as sending patterns, have been used in SMS spam detection, as in [28]. Similar network statistics-based methods designed for email spam detection can also be applied to identify SMS spam, as in [29-32]. However, these methods often suffer from high false positive rates because many legitimate customers can exhibit SMS sending patterns similar to those of spammers. In contrast, Greystar utilizes a novel concept of grey phone space to detect spam numbers, resulting in an extremely low false alarm rate.

**Mobile App-Based Solutions:**
Some systems have been developed as smartphone apps to classify spam messages on user devices [33-35]. However, not all mobile devices support executing such apps. Moreover, from a user's perspective, this method is a late defense, as the spam message has already arrived on the device, and the user may already be charged for it. Additionally, the high volume of spam messages that have traversed the cellular network may cause congestion and other adverse network performance impacts. Greystar, deployed inside the carrier network, does not have these drawbacks. As shown in Section 7, Greystar can quickly detect spam numbers once they start spamming, significantly reducing spam traffic volume in the network.

**Anomaly Detection Using Unwanted Traffic:**
Similar to our work, many studies have leveraged unwanted traffic for anomaly detection, such as Internet dark space [13, 36], grey space [12], honeynets [37, 38], and failed DNS traffic [39]. We are the first to advance the notion of grey phone space and propose a novel statistical method for identifying SMS spam using grey phone space.

### Conclusion and Future Work

**Conclusion:**
In this paper, we presented the design of Greystar, an innovative system for fast and accurate detection of SMS spam numbers. Greystar monitors a set of grey phone numbers, which signify impending spam activities targeting a large number of mobile users, and employs an advanced statistical model for detecting spam numbers based on their interactions with grey phone numbers. Using five months of SMS call detail records collected from a large cellular network in the US, we conducted extensive evaluations of Greystar in terms of detection accuracy and speed, demonstrating its great potential for reducing SMS spam traffic in the network.

**Future Work:**
Our future work will focus on applying Greystar to detect other suspicious activities in cellular networks, such as telemarketing campaigns. We will also correlate Greystar detection results with cellular data traffic to detect malware engaged in such spamming activities.
