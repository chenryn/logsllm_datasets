### Title: BotConf 2015 - Building a Better Botnet DGA Mousetrap: Separating Mice, Rats, and Cheese in DNS Data

Botnets and other malware are increasingly sophisticated in evading blacklisting in enterprise networks. This draft paper presents an innovative approach to detecting such botnets or other malicious entities by leveraging Domain Name Service (DNS) data and machine learning techniques. Our method is distinguished by three key features:

1. **Malware Family Identification**: We not only detect that a host machine is infected but also identify the specific family of blacklist-evading malware using only DNS data as input.
2. **Syntactic Rules and Machine Learning**: Our approach combines syntactic rules with machine learning algorithms to enhance detection accuracy.
3. **Comprehensive Coverage**: The system is capable of handling over two dozen different malware families.
