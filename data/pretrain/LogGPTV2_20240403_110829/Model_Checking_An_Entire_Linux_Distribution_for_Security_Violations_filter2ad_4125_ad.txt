### Introduction to the Variable `action_file_name`

The variable `action_file_name` is a string that consists of two components: a pathname to a temporary directory and a temporary file template. By default, the temporary directory is set to `/tmp`, but this can be changed by defining an environment variable. The second component, the temporary file template, contains placeholders (denoted by `X`) that are filled in with random numbers by the function creating the temporary filename.

### Concerns with `mkstemp` and `open_error`

The code in question involves the use of the `mkstemp` function, which returns a file descriptor for a safely created temporary file. However, the template passed to `mkstemp` should not be reused, as it may no longer be safe. In the given code, this template is passed to another function called `open_error`:

```c
void open_error(char *filename) {
    warnx("f - cannot open \"%s\"", filename);
    done(2);
}
```

In this fragment, the `warnx` function receives the filename, making it a potential point of interest for further inspection. Surprisingly, the MOPS tool directs us to the `done` function:

```c
void done(int k) {
    if (action_file)
        fclose(action_file);
    if (action_file_name[0])
        unlink(action_file_name);
}
```

Here, the `unlink` system call uses the `action_file_name` variable, which is the same template passed to `mkstemp`. This is unsafe because, by the time `unlink` is called, the filename may no longer point to the intended location. If the directory where the file is created is world-writable, an attacker with write access could change the file to a symbolic link, causing the program to delete unexpected files on the system. Unfortunately, there does not appear to be a straightforward resolution to this problem.

### Attacks Against `strncpy`

The standard library function `strncpy` is often misused, leading to security vulnerabilities. `strncpy(d, s, n)` copies up to `n` characters from the string `s` into the memory region `d`. If `s` contains more than `n` characters, only the first `n` characters are copied. If `s` contains fewer than `n` characters, `strncpy` pads the remaining space in `d` with null characters until the length of `d` reaches `n`.

#### Common Misuses of `strncpy`

1. **Off-by-One Errors**: If the programmer miscalculates the value of `n`, `strncpy` can cause the program to write past the end of the array bounds, leading to buffer overruns. This is particularly dangerous when the buffer is allocated on the runtime stack, as a malicious user can craft a special string `s` to overwrite the stack frame and corrupt the program.

2. **Unterminated Strings**: `strncpy` does not automatically null-terminate the destination string if the source string is larger than `n`. This can lead to unterminated strings, which can cause undefined behavior in the program.

#### Example of Safe and Unsafe Usage

- **Safe Usage**:
  ```c
  buf[sizeof(buf)-1] = '\0';
  strncpy(buf, ..., sizeof(buf)-1);
  ```
  Here, the buffer is null-terminated, ensuring safety.

- **Unsafe Usage**:
  ```c
  buf[sizeof(buf)-1] = '\0';
  strncpy(buf, ..., sizeof(buf));
  ```
  In this case, the null-terminating character may be overwritten, leading to an unterminated string.

  ```c
  memset(buf, 0, sizeof(buf)-1);
  strncpy(buf, ..., sizeof(buf)-1);
  ```
  Here, `memset` is used incorrectly, as it should zero out the entire buffer.

#### Detection with MOPS

MOPS uses a Finite State Automaton (FSA) to detect patterns that indicate misuse of `strncpy`. The FSA identifies correct ways to null-terminate strings and raises alarms when these idioms are not followed. For example, MOPS identified a potential issue in the `dumpImage` function:

```c
void dumpImage(Image *image, char *type, char *filename, int verbose) {
    int a;
    char typename[32];
    char *optptr;
    optptr = index(type, ',');
    if (optptr) {
        strncpy(typename, type, optptr - type);
        typename[optptr - type] = '\0';
        ...
    }
}
```

In this code, the length passed to `strncpy` is based on the second argument to `dumpImage`. If the user can control this argument, they can cause a buffer overrun. MOPS directed us to the call site, revealing that the string comes from command-line arguments, which can be set by the user.

### Results and Analysis

MOPS produced 1,378 unique warnings, which were too numerous to examine exhaustively. A semi-random sample of 16 packages out of 197 with one or more warning was selected, yielding 53 warnings. Among these, 11 bugs were found in 6 packages, where strings could be left unterminated or `strncpy` could overflow buffer bounds. Based on this sample, we estimate that a full manual audit would reveal approximately 286 bugs, with a 95% confidence interval of 165 to 468 bugs.

### Related Work

There is a growing body of work on software model checking, and MOPS is one of several tools in this area. Other notable tools include BLAST, SLAM, MAGIC, CMC, and Metal. These tools have been used to find bugs in various applications, including device drivers and the Linux kernel. MOPS has previously been used to find bugs in security-relevant packages from the Red Hat distribution. However, none of these tools have been applied on as large a scale as shown in this paper.

### Conclusion

Our work demonstrates the feasibility of large-scale model checking. We developed models of incorrect and insecure program behavior that are precise enough to prevent false positives from overwhelming real bugs. Using MOPS, we were able to manually inspect all error traces and find 108 real, exploitable software bugs. This work shows that model checking can be integrated into the development process, particularly with tools like MOPS that can be integrated into build processes.
