paign was stopped, the visit count dropped signiﬁcantly,
but restored quickly after the campaign was resumed.
Data from the other two sites show similar trends, which
proves the effectiveness of spider pool services.
Search results manipulation. To assess how search re-
sults are manipulated under keywords, especially long-
tail keywords, we sample 43 long-tail keywords under
4 categories discovered from customers’ messages and
query them on Google and Baidu. Then, we examine the
returned results from the ﬁrst page and look for wildcard
DNS domains in particular. If the search result associ-
ated with the wildcard DNS domain is ﬁlled with spam
texts, we consider it is manipulated by spider pool. In

the end, we ﬁnd spider pool compromised 27 keywords
in Google and 30 keywords in Baidu (see Table 10 of
Appendix E), indicating spider pool is quite effective and
widely used for poisoning long-tail keywords.
Interest-
ingly, the poisoned keywords show clear distinction be-
tween Google and Baidu under different categories: we
see keywords related to sex and medicine are more likely
to be poisoned in Baidu while for Google they are under
categories of ﬁrearms sales and fake certiﬁcate. Another
interesting ﬁnding is that adversary is able to manipulate
all search results (100%) under some keywords in Baidu,
especially under sex categories.
6 Discussion
Responsible disclosure and feedback. We have con-
tacted the security lab of Baidu and reported our ﬁnd-
ings and spider pool domains we discovered. Baidu ac-
knowledged our ﬁndings and is verifying our results. In
fact, Baidu is aware of the existence of spider pool, but
is surprised by the scale and the impact on search results.
To help Baidu clean the search results and mitigate the
threat, we applied the detection system to the indexed
URLs offered by Baidu and provide a report of spider
pool domains on a weekly basis.
Ethical issues. To understand the internal mechanisms
of spider pool, we paid the owner of SSP advertising fee
to include our sites into the SEO pages. This could raise
ethical concern as the criminal group was funded by us,
however, we argue that the inﬂuence was rather limited
as we ran the campaign for a small period and chose the
cheapest service category, costing only 8 dollars in total.
Another concern is that our inﬁltration experiment could
contribute to the pollution of search engine results. Yet,
we argue that the impact is still limited, as we intention-
ally chose hot keywords. Our sites were shown in search
results only when the user searched our URL directly. In
addition, we have closed the 3 test websites and informed
Google and Baidu via email to eliminate our URLs from
the search results after the study.
Limitations. We have designed and implemented a sys-
tem to detect SEO domains through DNS probing and
another system to explore the spider pool territory from
seed domains. However, if adversaries know these de-
tection algorithms, they can upgrade their infrastructures
for evasion. We discuss several evasion strategies in Sec-
tion 3.4. These strategies would increase the running cost
or reduce the effectiveness of spider pool without excep-
tion. Besides, as an initial step, our goal in this work is
to explore the landscape of this rising threat and measure
its impacts. A large volume of sites have been discov-
ered with the help of our systems and fulﬁlled the need
for measurement study. For the future work, we will in-
vestigate the feasible ways to improve the systems.
Recommendations to search engines. The search en-
gine can refrain from crawling and indexing pages under
SEO domains when the FQDNs are random and abun-
dant outbound links are embedded. However, extra ef-
forts should be taken to reduce the false positives. As
a matter of fact, it is also common that legitimate web
sites delegate subdomains to others, and they may exhibit
similar characteristics to SEO domains. We also suggest
search engines to keep a close watch on keywords, es-
pecially long-tail keywords, under certain topics. As de-
scribed in Section 5.4, spider pools tend to target limited
topics so their campaigns could be discovered by moni-
toring the associated long-tail keywords.

Understanding blackhat SEO. The damage caused by
blackhat SEO has been known for a long time and there
have been a corpus of works studying this issue. One
line of such works focused on the infrastructure of black-
hat SEO campaigns and how they are managed. Wang
et al. [51] inﬁltrated an SEO botnet and showed it is
quite effective in poisoning the trending search terms,
given its small size though. John et al. [24] dissected
an SEO campaign which hosted SEO pages on compro-
mised servers. Also an interesting topic is about how the
adversary makes use of blackhat SEO. McCoy et al. [34]
and Levchenko et al. [28] revealed that blackhat SEO
have been employed extensively for online store sell-
ing fake products and pharmaceutical afﬁliate networks.
Leontiadis et al. [26] measured the search-redirection at-
tacks used for drug trade and the result suggests such at-
tacks could overwhelm legitimate sites in search results
and provide more trafﬁc than email spam to the store-
front sites. To ﬁght against these threats, search engines
have being taken active actions and the studies show the
countermeasures were effective to some extend but there
is still long way ahead to win the battle [27, 35, 49].
Detecting blackhat SEO. Inspired by the studies of
blackhat SEO campaigns, several detection approaches
have been proposed based on different features revealed
from known SEO attacks.
John et al. [24] leveraged
URL signatures to identify SEO pages from a dataset
of URLs provided by search engines. Lu et .al. [31]
detected search poisoning by inspecting the redirection
chains unfolded when visiting a search result. Zhang et
al. [56] presented an approach which is capable of detect-
ing compromised sites abused for search poisoning from
seed sites. The features related to cloaking behaviors of
SEO sites [50] and content spinning on SEO pages [57]
were exploited for detection as well.
Wildcard DNS. Wildcard DNS is a widely used to map
different hostnames to the same IP and save the admin-
istrators from maintaining many different records. The
security implications, however, are not thoroughly eval-
258  25th USENIX Security Symposium 
USENIX Association

uated yet. The only relevant research we knew so far
measured the prevalence of wildcard DNS conﬁguration
and showed that it is broadly used by malicious sites [25].
Long-tail SEO Spam. Due to the intensive competi-
tion on hot keywords, many blackhat SEOers now start
to target long-tail keywords. Still, the understanding is
limited. So far, we only found one recent work study-
ing this topic and showed the cloud web hosting service
is abused for long-tail SEO spam [30]. Our study com-
plements the existing works by revealing a new strategy
from blackhat SEOers.
8 Conclusion
In this paper, we conducted the ﬁrst comprehensive in-
vestigation on a new type blackhat SEO technique called
“spider pool” which abuses wildcard DNS to tamper
long-tail keywords of search engines. Based on the un-
derstanding through inﬁltrating a shared spider pool ser-
vice, we developed a DNS prober which can identify the
SEO domains with high accuracy and efﬁciency, together
with a spider pool explorer which is able to excavate the
domains used by individual spider pool through seed ex-
pansion. Our results show that spider pool has become
a big threat to registrars, search engines and their users,
as more than 458K SEO domains have been discovered,
popular sites like amazon.com are abused to promote il-
legal messages, and long-tail keywords can be easily pol-
luted. We think this new threat should be mitigated and
call for the attention from the security community.
