ABSTRACT
Energy eﬃciency is one of important issues in the resource
contrained wireless sensor network. In this paper, we pro-
pose the authentication and key agreement protocol that
eﬃciently reduces the overall computational and communi-
cation costs in the next generation converged network. The
enhanced security procedures are operated through the mo-
bile network in order to maximize the lifetime of the sensor
networks and to apply the combined capabilities of both
networks.

INTRODUCTION
As a de facto standard for the wireless sensor networks
(WSNs), Zigbee [3] speciﬁes the security functions that the
key agreement architecture is operated by using keys that
are pre-distributed. However, it is hard to assume the pre-
distribution of keys in large scale network. Thus, many ac-
tive researches such as [1, 2, 8] are continued in order to pro-
vide eﬃcient authentication and key distribution in WSNs.
Ibriq and Mahgoub [5] proposed an eﬃcient hierarchical
key establishment model with ‘partial key escrow table’. Us-
ing the key escrow table, a sink can self-generate the shared
key for the attached nodes: An intermediate sink has a par-
tial key escrow table that stores the partial information of
nodes. After the requests from nodes are received, the sink
request the authentication ticket to the base station. After
receiving the ticket, the sink authenticates and shares keys
with nodes.
Therefore, our motivation is to bring the more beneﬁts

from the consolidation of WSNs and 3G mobile network (3G-
WSN) based on the standard architecture. We propose an
eﬃcient and secure authentication and key exchange pro-
tocol between sensor nodes and the smartphone with sen-
sors. Since the eﬃcient resource management is one of the
most important requirements in WSNs, our approach con-
centrates on how to minimize the energy consumption and
ineﬃcient message transmission.
2. AUTHENTICATION VIA MOBILE NET-
WORK
2.1 System model
Figure 1 shows our proposed model that the sensor at-
tached smart phone communicates to the authentication server
via mobile network, and directly communicates to the sen-
sor. In the architecture, the sensor network can be a kind of
third party application in the mobile network applying the
generic authentication architecture (GAA) [7].
Figure 1: Proposed system model integrates a sen-
sor network as one of application into the mobile
communication network.
The sensor attached smartphone as a mobile device (M D)
has GAA module and Zigbee module. The network consists
of mobile network entities such as a bootstrapping server
function (BSF) and a network application function (NAF),
and the sensor network entity such as sinks. For more detail
of BSF and NAF, please refer [7]. We assume that a sensor
network consists of a base station and sensor nodes (sinks).

2.2 Protocol Description
The protocol is mainly divided into two parts: Phase 1 is
operated in the mobile network, and Phase 2 is operated in
the sensor network. We show the notations and the message
types used in the protocol in Table 1. M REQ and M RES
are transmitted in Phase 1 via mobile network. S REQ,
S RES, S CON are the messages transmitted in Phase 2
via the sensor network.
2.2.1 Pre-Phase: Neighbor Discovery
Every sensor periodically broadcasts HELLO message to
ﬁnd the neighbor sensors. A sink S1 periodically broadcasts
{R0||T S} and
HELLO with u0 and v0, where u0 = eCKS1
v0 = M ACIKS1
(u0). R0 is a random nonce selected by S1,
and T S is a timestamp.
When M D receives the HELLO message from S1 already
authenticated, M D ignores this phase. Thus, the energy
cost and message size of this phase is not considered for the
performance analysis of this protocol.
2.2.2 Phase 1: Authentication via Mobile Network
When M D is ﬁrstly joining the network, M D has to
share keys CKM D and IKM D with the serving network
using GAA. When unauthenticated M D receives HELLO
from S1, M D requests the authentication of S1 to the NAF.
M D generates u1 using CKM D and v1 using IKM D, where
u1 = eCKMD{S1||u0||v0} and v1 = M ACIKMD (M D||u1).
After that M D send u1 and v1 to NAF.
M D → N AF : M REQ||M D||u1||v1
If NAF has no information of M D, NAF asks BSF about
M D and obtains CKM D and IKM D from GAA process.
{h(R0
NAF then generates u2 and v2, where u2 = eCKS1
||CKM D)|| h(R0||IKM D)} and v2 = M ACIKS1
(R0||u2).
NAF also generates u3 and v3, where u3 = eCKMD{R0||
T S||h(R0||CKS1 )||h(R0||IKS1 )|| u2||v2} and v3 = M ACIKMD
(M RES||u3). And, the NAF sends u3 and v3 to M D.
N AF → M D : M RES||M D||u3||v3
After verifying v3 and decrypting u3, M D retrieves R0,
h(R0||CKS1 ) and h(R0||IKS1 ). Then M D generates CKS1M D
and IKS1M D, shared session keys between M D and S1, us-
ing one way function KDF , as follows:
CKS1M D = KDF (h(R0||CKS1 )||h(R0||CKM D))
2
IKS1M D = KDF (h(R0||IKS1 )||h(R0||IKM D))
2.2.3 Phase 2: Mutual Authentication between MD
and Sensor
After the authentication process between M D and NAF,
M D generates the shard session keys CKS1M D and IKS1M D.
M D computes v4 using IKS1M D, where v4 = M ACIKS1MD
(S REQ||M D||S1||R0||u2||v2) and sends v4 with u2 and v2
to S1 as follows.
M D → S1 : S REQ||M D||S1||u2||v2||v4
When S1 receives u2, v2 and v4, S1 checks the valid-
ity of v2 at ﬁrst. After that S1 decrypts u2 and retrieves
h(R0||CKM D) and h(R0||IKM D). S1 generates IKS1M D
with h(R0||IKM D) and veriﬁes v4. Finally, S1 generates v5
as the response to M D, where v5 = M ACIKS1MD (S RES
||S1||M D||R0) and sends it to MD as follows:
S1 → M D : S RES||S1||M D||v5
After M D veriﬁes v5, M D generates v6 for the conﬁrma-
tion of the authentication response, where v6 = M ACIKS1MD
(S CON||M D||S1||R0 + 1) and sends it to S1 as follows:
M D → S1 : S CON||M D||S1||v6
R0 + 1 is the update of R0 with addition and used for the
freshness check, and can be substituted with other meth-
ods. S1 completes the authentication of M D by checking
the validity of v6.
3. ANALYSIS
In this section, we show the analysis of the proposed pro-
tocol. At ﬁrst, we show the security analysis of our proposed
protocol, and then show the eﬃciency of our proposed design
by comparing with the previous models.
3.1 Security of Proposed Protocol
We analyze the security of our protocol against key com-
promise, message forgery and several known attacks.
Security Against Key Compromise
3.1.1
The share session keys are initially generated using the
master seed key stored in USIM. Since the transmitted key
generating informations are encrypted, an adversary A fails
to know such information. Also, the shared session keys CK
and IK are generated using R0.
Assume the node S1 is compromised, A may try to know
the value of CKM D and IKM D in order to impersonate M D.
However, A is only able to generate the shared session key
between M D and S1 using the only known informations of
M D are h(R0||CKM D) and h(R0||IKM D). A cannot know
CKM D from h(R0||CKM D due to the one-wayness of cryp-
tographic hash function.
Security Against Message Forgery
3.1.2
In our protocol, every packet is protected by Message Au-
thentication Code (MAC). An adversary A should be able
to forge MAC to success the attack. Thus, our protocol is
secure against the man-in-the-middle attack while the ad-
versary has no eﬃcient way to forge MAC.
Secure and eﬃcient interworking of several diﬀerent net-
works is the important issue in the next generation con-
vergence network. In this paper, we proposed an eﬃcient
authentication and key exchange protocol for the 3G-WSN
network by integrating WSN into 3G network as the appli-
cation. While most communications are operated under the
mobile network, the communication in the sensor network
is minimized than previous work. When the hop distance
between end-to-end nodes are ﬁve in the sensor network,
energy cost in the sensor network applying our proposed de-
sign is estimated to be dropped by about 90 percent than
previous models.

Security against known attacks
3.1.3
Since the most parts of the proposed protocol are operated
in the mobile networks, most attacks on the sensor network
[6] do not aﬀect on the proposed protocol. Thus we only con-
sider the security of Phase 2 that the direct authentication
process between M D and S1.
The replay attack fails in the protocol due to the random
nonce used in the packet at each session. Wormhole attack
on our protocol fails since the adversary cannot send the
conﬁrmation message. Spoofed, altered or replayed rout-
ing information attacks also fail without knowing encrypted
nonce in our protocol. The sinkhole attack against our pro-
tocol fails without knowing the keys. Sybil attacks also fails
from veriﬁcation of identity of nodes.
3.2 Performance Comparison
We compare our proposed model with Ibriq and Mah-
goub’s protocol [5] that provides signiﬁcant eﬃciency for
WSNs. For measuring the approximate communication over-
heads in each design, we deﬁned the message size with MAC
size as 4 bytes, the time stamp as 8 bytes, nonce as 8 bytes,
and key size as 16 bytes as shown in [1]. And, We set the
source and target IDs as 1 byte, respectively. For our pro-
tocol, we also set the message types as 1 byte. We refer
the energy cost for the transmitting the messages are esti-
mated based on the experimental results in [4], which used
the MICAz running at 7.37 MHz and TelosB at 4 MHz for
application data rates of respectively 108 kbps and 75 kbps.
Based on the such results, our proposed protocol shows ap-
proximately 172 µJ in the authentication between M D and
a sink, concentrating the most communication to the mobile
network.

Table 2 shows the more detailed comparison for authen-
ticating M D. Our protocol shows the signiﬁcant eﬃciency
compared with previous model. Since only two nodes are
involved in the communication under the sensor network in
Phase 2, overall message size is small and static. Energy cost
for transmission is also dropped by about 90 percent than
the previous protocol. The computation overhead is not con-
sidered for the performance analysis, since such overhead is
negligibly lower than in the communication. Although there
is additional energy cost in Phase 1, we can ignore such
overhead because a mobile phone can be daily recharged in
general.
Therefore, the separated communication suited applica-
tion’s purpose in 3G network and WSN enables us to use the
maximized beneﬁts of the consolidated network, the more
applicable architecture.
