device automatically switches to circuit switched network, i.e. 2G
or 3G, to receive the call. However, in case of (2) the victim device
does not performs automatic inter-system switch, and the attacker
needs to enforce it. From our experiments, we find that if the VoLTE
call is blocked at device for 5 seconds then the LTE modem chipset
(Qualcomm LTE modem) aborts VoLTE call in favor of making the
call through CSFB. This feature has also been reported in several
other studies[33, 34]. Now, the attacker strategy is to temporarily
block (through UL jamming) the signaling messages between victim
device and its network. But the question arises (i) when to start
jamming after dialing the call?; (ii) how long the attacker can delay
1881ACSAC ’21, December 6–10, 2021, Virtual Event, USA

in starting jamming because in practice it is hard to start jamming
at a precise time?; and (iii) when the attacker should hang-up the
call after stopping jamming so that the victim device does not ring?
For (i), table 2 shows error margin with min, max and average val-
ues of 2.2s, 4.3s, 3.3s with standard deviation of 0.5s for attacker
to start UL jamming. That is, the time he has from initiating the
call to sniffing the paging message (voice call indication for victim
device in idle state). Once the attacker has decided to start UL jam-
ming, he has an error margin of 0.4s (on average) with standard
deviation of 40ms to start jamming as shown in Table 2. This is the
time in which victim device establishes the VoLTE call connection
with the network, answering question point (ii). The jamming lasts
for 5s that induces victim device to perform CSFB procedure to
establish voice call connection over 3G/2G network instead of LTE.
The attacker hangs-up the call before the victim device rings (i.e.
within 3.3 seconds – refer to Table 1 Paging to Call ringing time –
after stopping the jamming) which addresses our question point
(iii). On hanging-up the call, the device switches back to LTE and
performs RACH procedure that facilitates attacker to map TMSI
with C-RNTI. The attacker has on average 45ms (10ms of STD) to
capture RACH Response and/or RRC Connection Request message
to successfully establish mapping, as shown in Figure 5(a).

that the victim device fails to establish the VoLTE call connection. As a result,
the victim phone receives call through CSFB procedure.

Administrating key reinstallation attack through one-
time jamming After the authentication procedure, the core net-
work activates the Security Mode procedure by sending integrity
protected SMC message to the device and sets the message retry
timer T3460 (default value of 6s). The attacker who is sniffing the
radio traffic finds the SMC message matching the victim’s C-RNTI
and starts UL jamming. The attacker has the error margin of 2
messages in starting UL jamming (i.e. either after sniffing Authen-
tication Response message, or Security Mode Command message).
On receiving the SMC message from the network, the device ver-
ifies message integrity, resets counts (vulnerability 1 in Section
5.1.1), and sends Security Mode Complete message to the network.
Because this UL message from device is blocked over the air, the
network does not receive this response message and its timer T3460
expires. The network re-sends SMC message to victim device by
resetting the timer T3460. The victim subscriber resets its UL/DL
transmission count values and sends the Security Mode Complete
message which is blocked as well by the attacker. Similarly, the
third response to network initiated Security Mode procedure is
also blocked. Meanwhile, the TAU timer T3430 at victim device
times out. At this point, the device has already enabled ciphering
(as it has sent out Security Mode Complete messages thrice). The
victim subscriber prepares new TAU Request message and applies
ciphering and integrity protection. It sends out the TAU request
message which the attacker sniffs and stores it at his end. We call
this message T AU1, that is TAU Request message 1 which is en-
crypted with keystream block5. Note that the attacker can recover
the TAU message as he himself is jamming resilient. This is because
he knows his off tone jamming signals and can cancel interference
added to jam the signals[19, 22, 38, 39]. However, the TAU message
is non-decodable at the network side due to unknown interference.
When the Security Mode procedure fails for the fourth time, the
attacker stops UL jamming. As a result, the Security Mode proce-
dure succeeds on its fifth try where the network resets counts and
enables ciphering its end. From this point onward, the network only
accepts messages which are both integrity protected and ciphered.
Experiment results: In order to make the attack practical, the
attacker has to ensure that he (i) identifies the victim over the ra-
dio before starting UL jamming, and (ii) starts UL jamming before
Security Mode Command complete receives at the network. For (i),
he has an error margin of 380ms on average (with STD of 20ms) to
identify the victim device through PDSCH. This is the time between
RRC Connection request and Security Mode Command messages,
as shown in Figure 5(b). For (ii), the attacker has on average 48ms
(with 5ms STD) to start UL jamming (after Authentication Response
message but before Security Mode Complete message), as shown
in Figure 5(c).
We also perform more than 200 lab experiments to assess the success
probability of starting jamming within the specific time interval (i.e.
48ms). For this, we first use Qualcomm real time packet sniffing tool
QXDM[3] to calibrate the time between performing inter-system
switch and starting UL jamming. We modify the HACRF One source
code to make jamming effective, and achieve UL and DL frequency
jamming within 1ms after its initialization. We face two challenges
in jamming specific LTE signaling message(s). From our experi-
ments, we find that when we jam signals for more than 6 seconds
the device internally triggers radio link failure, and if we continue
jamming then the device switches to 3G network. To address this
challenge, we systematically switch on and off jamming in an in-
terval of 2.5s such that desired signaling messages remain blocked
when they are re-transmitted on their time-out. The other challenge
we face was regarding jamming UL signaling messages. We find
that the device increases its UL transmit power (as high as 25dBm
whereas our HACKRF One max UL transmit power is 15dBm) that
renders UL jamming through low cost SDR device ineffective. To
address this challenge, we perform DL jamming instead and block
the TAU Accept message reaching towards the device. As the TAU
procedure does not succeed after all, the network responds to re-
transmitted TAU request messages (as well as the spoofed message
to be discussed in the next step below) even if it has received TAU
request message earlier. Hence, we can successfully execute our
attack step in practice.
On practicality of jamming: We briefly discuss that our jamming
works even if the attacker lacks LTE dedicated channel sniffing ca-
pability. We can always start jamming at desired signaling message
with high probability. To evaluate this, we use three different meth-
ods, as discussed below:
Straw-man approach: The attacker makes a CSFB call towards vic-
tim, hangs-up the call as soon as the victim subscriber receives
5Obviously, this message is also integrity protected, but we are interested to break the
ciphering only to carry out our attack

paging message, and starts jamming after waiting for 450ms (cal-
culated according to Figure 5). We see that in this case the success
probability of jamming is just 21%. This is mainly because the at-
tacker hangs-up call while victim device was in the middle of call
establishment procedure. This triggers location update procedure
in 3G and the device does not release the connection towards LTE
network.
Measured approach: To address the problem of straw-man approach,
we let the control-plane call establishment procedure to be com-
pleted before hanging-up the call. The attacker lets the call estab-
lishment procedure to be completed before it hangs-up the call (just
before call ringing). Hanging-up the call at this time triggers RRC
connection release towards LTE network and the victim device
immediately switches back to LTE network. The attacker starts
the jamming after waiting for 450ms and gets the desired message
blocked with the accuracy of 58%. The accuracy is halfed due to
variable time of inter-system switch (i.e. how quickly LTE cell is
selected).
Adaptive approach: Instead of calculating the jamming start time
from call release event, we improve our results by sniffing the LTE
broadcast RACH packet before making the jamming decision. Our
results improve the jamming accuracy to 78% because in reality we
cannot 100% predict when control-signaling message will arrive in
future.
In summary, we show that the jamming at the desired occasion can
be achieved with the accuracy of roughly 80% even if the attacker
does not sniff LTE dedicated channel.
Spoofing location update messages through keystream
block reuse Because the attacker has stopped jamming in step
,
the device initiated TAU request (on expiry of TAU timer T3430),
we call it T AU2, arrives at the network6. The attacker sniffs this
TAU request message as well and retrieves the keystream block by
6Careful reader should note that T3430 times out earlier than TAU Accept timer T3450
(default value 6s) at the network therefore network does not send TAU Accept message
on receiving Security Mode Complete message

xoring either the contents of T AU1 or T AU27. Recall that, he already
gets hold of TAU request message (as initial NAS message) sent
in plain text in step
. Once he retrieves keystream block from
the ciphered text, he encrypts his spoofed TAU request message
that includes wrong device location identity by xoring the retrieved
keystream block. He replaces his C-RNTI with victim’s one8
and immediately sends the spoofed message to the network. The
network receives the spoofed TAU request message while it was
waiting for TAU Complete message from device (as the network
sends TAU Accept message after receiving T AU2). According to
LTE 3GPP standard, the network aborts previously received TAU
message and processes the newly arrived message with different
location identity (i.e. location information element). It has been
stated in LTE NAS specification (3GPP TS 24.301[6]):
“If one or more of the information elements in the TRACKING AREA
UPDATE REQUEST message differ from the ones received within the
previous TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, the previ-
ously initiated tracking area updating procedure shall be aborted if
the TRACKING AREA UPDATE COMPLETE message has not been
received."
The network decrypts the attacker originated TAU message and
checks the integrity of the message. As the message contents were
modified by the attacker, the TAU request fails the integrity check.
The network finds that this is a special NAS message (4.4.4.3 In-
tegrity checking of NAS signaling messages in the MME [6])) and
it should be processed when the device fails the integrity check
(vulnerability 2 in Section 5.1.1). However, before accepting the
message, the network successfully authenticates the victim device
(by initiating the Authentication procedure), and sends TAU Accept
message to the victim device. The victim devices replies with TAU
Complete message to network that registers the spoofed device
location identity in its database.
7Careful readers will argue that why the attacker needs to wait for second retransmitted
TAU when he can create spoofed message at step . We do so to avoid the victim
device transitioning back to registered state from TAU init state when the TAU timer
T3430 expires while the spoofed TAU is being processed at the network. That can
invalidate our attack in which the device initiated TAU rectifies the location identity
8C-RNTI spoofing is necessary so that LTE base station forwards the attacker’s spoofed
message towards victim’s S1AP connection.

Experiment results: To make this step successful, the network
must receive the attacker’s spoofed message before the TAU Com-
plete message arrives from the victim device. This is the time be-
tween receiving Security Mode Complete and TAU Complete mes-
sages (a device response to TAU Accept message of T AU2). From
Figure 5(d), we can see that the attacker has on average 370msec
(15msec STD) to prepare and send its spoofed message to the net-
work. For validating the impact of spoofed message, we modify
the non-volatile memory of the LTE modem and used Qualcomm’s
service-programmer tool (QPST Service Programmer)[2], and AT-
command tool (TeraTerm)[4] to send the spoofed message.
5.1.3 Attack damage. The consequence of our attacker is that the
network updates the victim device location to erroneous tracking
area. When the victim device enters in the idle state, it releases
the RRC connection. The device relies upon the paging message
from the network for the notification of its data packets during
its idle state (e.g. if someone sends a text message, or voice call to
victim). Because the attacker has registered the victim device on
wrong location by hijacking TAU procedure, the victim device does
not receive the paging message. Hence, the victim device remains
unreachable for its incoming voice and data traffic.
Constraints: To realize the attack, the device must transition to
idle state after performing the TAU procedure. The maximum time
the victim device remains under attack is the time until it performs
periodic TAU procedure (default value of 54 minutes). Note that,
other LTE procedures such as Service Request procedure or VoLTE
call establishment do not have any impact on our attack (i.e. they
do not shorten the attack time).
Extending the attack period: The attacker can easily re-launch
the attack to keep the victim device under attack even if the device
updates its location through periodic TAU procedure, establishing a
CSFB call, or even rebooting. After launching the attack for the first
time, the attacker periodically pages the victim device by initiating
a call towards him. If attacker’s call generates the paging message,
it means the victim subscriber has recovered from the attack. The
attacker then re-launches the attack by following steps
,
and keeps the victim subscriber under attack.

5.2 Designing LTE Service Outage Attack
We extend our location hijacking attack to bring more serious attack.
In this variant of the attack, the attacker sends Detach Request
message (with cause power off) instead of sending the spoofed TAU
request message at step
to the network. There are two scenarios
that occur at the network. First, the network receives the device
de-registration request in the middle of ongoing TAU procedure (i.e.
the network is waiting for TAU Complete message from the device).
Second, the detach request being sent by the attacker is bound to
fail the integrity check at the network. The 3GPP standard explicitly
