### Device Behavior and Attack Strategy

When a device is in a VoLTE (Voice over LTE) environment, it may automatically switch to a circuit-switched network (e.g., 2G or 3G) to receive a call. However, if the device does not perform this automatic inter-system switch, the attacker must enforce it. Our experiments show that if a VoLTE call is blocked for 5 seconds, the Qualcomm LTE modem chipset will abort the VoLTE call and switch to CSFB (Circuit-Switched FallBack) to complete the call. This behavior has been reported in several studies [33, 34].

#### Attacker's Strategy

The attacker aims to temporarily block signaling messages between the victim device and the network using UL (Uplink) jamming. The key questions are:
1. When should the attacker start jamming after dialing the call?
2. How long can the attacker delay starting the jamming?
3. When should the attacker hang up the call after stopping the jamming to prevent the victim device from ringing?

**Timing and Error Margins:**
- **Call Initiation to Jamming Start:**
  - The attacker has an error margin of 2.2s to 4.3s (average 3.3s, standard deviation 0.5s) from initiating the call to sniffing the paging message.
  - Once the paging message is detected, the attacker has an average of 0.4s (standard deviation 0.04s) to start jamming.

- **Jamming Duration and Call Hang-Up:**
  - The jamming lasts for 5 seconds, inducing the victim device to perform CSFB.
  - The attacker should hang up the call within 3.3 seconds after stopping the jamming to prevent the device from ringing.

**Post-Jamming Actions:**
- After hanging up, the device switches back to LTE and performs the RACH (Random Access Channel) procedure, which allows the attacker to map TMSI (Temporary Mobile Subscriber Identity) with C-RNTI (Cell Radio Network Temporary Identifier).
- The attacker has an average of 45ms (standard deviation 10ms) to capture the RACH Response and/or RRC (Radio Resource Control) Connection Request message to establish the mapping.

### Administering Key Reinstallation Attack through One-Time Jamming

After the authentication procedure, the core network activates the Security Mode procedure by sending an integrity-protected SMC (Security Mode Command) message to the device and sets a message retry timer (T3460, default value 6s). The attacker, who is monitoring the radio traffic, identifies the SMC message matching the victim’s C-RNTI and starts UL jamming. The attacker has an error margin of 2 messages to start UL jamming (i.e., either after sniffing the Authentication Response message or the SMC message).

**Key Steps:**
- **Device Response:**
  - On receiving the SMC message, the device verifies its integrity, resets counts, and sends a Security Mode Complete message to the network.
  - Since the UL message is blocked, the network does not receive the response, and the timer T3460 expires.
  - The network resends the SMC message, and the process repeats, with the device resetting its UL/DL transmission count values each time.

- **TAU (Tracking Area Update) Procedure:**
  - The TAU timer (T3430) at the victim device times out, and the device prepares a new TAU Request message, applying ciphering and integrity protection.
  - The attacker sniffs and stores this TAU Request message (TAU1), which is encrypted with keystream block5.
  - The attacker can recover the TAU message because he is jamming resilient and can cancel the interference added to the signals [19, 22, 38, 39].

- **Final Steps:**
  - When the Security Mode procedure fails for the fourth time, the attacker stops UL jamming.
  - The Security Mode procedure succeeds on the fifth try, and the network resets counts and enables ciphering.
  - From this point, the network only accepts messages that are both integrity-protected and ciphered.

### Experimental Results

To make the attack practical, the attacker must:
1. Identify the victim over the radio before starting UL jamming.
2 - Start UL jamming before the Security Mode Command complete message is received by the network.

- **Identification Time:**
  - The attacker has an average of 380ms (standard deviation 20ms) to identify the victim device through PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel).
  - For starting UL jamming, the attacker has an average of 48ms (standard deviation 5ms) to start jamming after the Authentication Response message but before the Security Mode Complete message.

- **Lab Experiments:**
  - Over 200 lab experiments were conducted to assess the success probability of starting jamming within the specific time interval (48ms).
  - Tools like QXDM [3] and modified HACRF One source code were used to calibrate and achieve effective UL and DL frequency jamming within 1ms after initialization.
  - Challenges included preventing radio link failure and addressing high UL transmit power, which were mitigated by systematic jamming and blocking TAU Accept messages.

### Practicality of Jamming

Even without LTE dedicated channel sniffing capability, the attacker can start jamming at the desired signaling message with high probability. Three methods were evaluated:

- **Straw-Man Approach:**
  - The attacker makes a CSFB call, hangs up immediately after the victim receives the paging message, and starts jamming after 450ms. Success probability: 21%.

- **Measured Approach:**
  - The attacker completes the call establishment procedure before hanging up, triggering RRC connection release towards the LTE network. Success probability: 58%.

- **Adaptive Approach:**
  - The attacker sniffs the LTE broadcast RACH packet before making the jamming decision. Success probability: 78%.

### Spoofing Location Update Messages

After stopping jamming, the device initiates a TAU request (TAU2) due to the TAU timer (T3430) expiry. The attacker sniffs this TAU request and retrieves the keystream block by XORing the contents of TAU1 or TAU2. The attacker then encrypts a spoofed TAU request message with the wrong device location identity and sends it to the network, replacing his C-RNTI with the victim’s C-RNTI.

- **Network Response:**
  - The network decrypts the spoofed TAU message, checks its integrity, and finds it fails the check.
  - The network processes the spoofed message as a special NAS (Non-Access Stratum) message, authenticates the victim device, and sends a TAU Accept message.
  - The victim device replies with a TAU Complete message, registering the spoofed device location identity in the network’s database.

### Attack Damage and Constraints

- **Consequences:**
  - The network updates the victim device’s location to an erroneous tracking area.
  - The victim device remains unreachable for incoming voice and data traffic during its idle state.

- **Constraints:**
  - The device must transition to an idle state after performing the TAU procedure.
  - The maximum attack duration is the time until the periodic TAU procedure (default 54 minutes).

- **Extending the Attack Period:**
  - The attacker can re-launch the attack by periodically paging the victim device and re-initiating the attack steps if the victim recovers.

### Designing LTE Service Outage Attack

This variant of the attack involves sending a Detach Request message (with cause "power off") instead of a spoofed TAU request. The network receives the de-registration request, and the detach request fails the integrity check. The 3GPP standard dictates that the network should handle this situation, leading to more severe consequences such as service outages.
