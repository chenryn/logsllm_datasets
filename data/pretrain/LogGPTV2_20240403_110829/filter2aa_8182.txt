# What Lies Within
Forensics, 150 points
## Description:
> Theres something in the building. Can you retrieve the flag?
An image was attached.
## Solution:
This challenge is similar to last year's [Reading Between the Eyes](/2018_picoCTF/Reading%20Between%20the%20Eyes.md). 
The flag was hidden using LSB encoding, and could be revealed using `zsteg`.
