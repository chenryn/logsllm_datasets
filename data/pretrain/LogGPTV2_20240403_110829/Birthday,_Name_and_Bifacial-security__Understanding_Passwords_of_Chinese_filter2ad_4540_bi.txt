new popular passwords may be out of static blacklists
and subtle to detect. Hence, password creation policies
alone (e.g., length and blacklist rules [25, 55]) are in-
adequate for preventing such weak passwords. An in-
depth defense approach is needed: whenever possible, in
addition to password creation policies, password strength
meters (e.g., fuzzyPSM [54] and Zxcvbn [59]) can be
further employed by security-critical services to detect
and prevent weak passwords.
5.2 For password strength meters
Leading password strength meters (PSMs) employ the
guess number needed for a password-cracking algorithm
(e.g. PCFG) to break that password as an indicator of
password strength [24]. In Sec. 1, we have exempliﬁed
that the PSMs of four popular services are highly incon-
sistent in assessing the security of (weak) Chinese pass-
words. Failing to provide accurate/coherent feedback on
user password choices would have negative effects such
as user confusion, frustration and distrust [48, 60]. Thus,
Carnavalet and Mannan [12] suggested that PSMs “can
simplify challenges by limiting their primary goal only to
detect weak passwords, instead of trying to distinguish a
good, very good, or great password.”
It follows that an essential step of a PSM would be
to identify the characteristics of weak passwords. From
our ﬁndings in Section 3.3 and Section 4.1, it is evident
that for passwords of Chinese users, the incorporation of
long Pinyin words or full/family names is an important
evidence/weight for a “weak” decision. Other signs of
weak Chinese passwords are the incorporation of birth-
dates and simple patterns like repetition, palindrome and
keyboard. As a caveat, even if signs of weak passwords
are found, one cannot simply deem such passwords as
weak and reject them as is done in many high-proﬁle
sites (e.g., Microsoft Azure [18]) and by the “substring
blacklist” approach recommended in [44]. Instead, such
undesirable/insecure signs should be weighted (see some
promising attempts in [54, 59]).
The superiority of our improved PCFG-based attacks
over Li et al.’s [34] (see Sec. 4.1) is partly attributed to
the proper selection of Duowan (instead of Dodonew as
in [34]) as the training set. This indicates that, for a PSM
to be accurate, its training set should be representative
of the password base of the target site. The distance of
letter distributions (see Table 2) would be an effective
metric. In addition, the universal “bifacial-security na-
ture” revealed in Sec. 4 implies that, the language factor
is more impactful than service type. We also ﬁnd that
CSDN passwords are weaker than Dodonew passwords
(see Figs. 4 and 6), but CSDN imposes a stricter policy
than Dodonew, and this suggests that the service-type
factor might be more impactful than password policy.
Thus, when measuring the letter distributions is infea-
sible, these con-founding factors underlying a password
distribution can be considered for training-set selection:
1) In the order of language, service, and password policy;
and 2) The closer the training set to the target password,
the better. This suggests that there is no single training
set that can ﬁt all PSMs. Thus, PSMs that are originally
designed for English speaking users and also do not
employ a training set (e.g., NIST entropy [10], RNN-
PSM [38] and Zxcvbn [59]) cannot be readily applied
to Chinese users. This also explains why such PSMs
are generally less accurate than those using a training set
(e.g., fuzzyPSM [54]) as observed in [24].
5.3 For password cracking
Password cracking algorithms are not only necessary
tools for security administrators to measure password
strength, but also they can be used to facilitate infor-
mation forensics (e.g., for law enforcement agencies to
recover encrypted data of criminal suspects). Three main
lessons for password cracking can be learned from our
above results. Firstly, our ﬁndings in Sec. 3.3 show
