## Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)
| Platform | Tactic | Technique | Description | Data Sources |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| macOS, Windows | [Defense Evasion](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/defense-evasion/) | [Hidden Window](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1143/) | DarkHydrus has used the `-WindowStyle Hidden` parameter to conceal PowerShell windows. | Windows event logs, PowerShell logs, process command-line parameters, process monitoring, file monitoring |
| Windows | [Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/execution/) | [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1086/) | DarkHydrus leveraged PowerShell to download and execute additional scripts. | PowerShell logs, loaded DLLs, DLL monitoring, Windows Registry, file monitoring, process monitoring, process command-line parameters |
| Windows | [Credential Access](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/credential-access/) | [Forced Authentication](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1187/) | DarkHydrus used template injection to launch an authentication window, prompting users to enter their credentials. | File monitoring, network protocol analysis, network device logs, process use of network |
| Windows, macOS, Linux | [Initial Access](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/initial-access/) | [Spearphishing Attachment](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1193/) | DarkHydrus has sent spearphishing emails containing password-protected RAR archives with malicious Excel Web Query files (.iqy). Additionally, they have sent emails with malicious Microsoft Office documents using the "attachedTemplate" technique to load a template from a remote server. | File monitoring, packet capture, network intrusion detection system, detonation chamber, email gateway, mail server |
