# Environment
- **Operating System:** Microsoft Windows 10, Version 18362.900
- **PowerToys Version:** 0.18.2
- **PowerToy Module (if applicable):** PowerToys

# Steps to Reproduce
1. Start the PC with PowerToys configured to run on startup.
2. Ensure that "Run as administrator" is enabled for PowerToys.

# Expected Behavior
In previous versions of PowerToys (before 0.18), after granting "Run as administrator" rights once, the system did not prompt for these rights again on subsequent startups.

# Actual Behavior
After every PC startup, a window appears asking whether I want to start PowerToys with administrative privileges.
