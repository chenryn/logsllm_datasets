### Title: Botconf2019: Tracking an Android Botnet Using OSINT and APK Analysis Tools

**Abstract:**

Analyzing malware is a critical component in the prevention and detection of cyber threats. However, to fully understand the threat landscape, it is essential to also comprehend how malware is disseminated. In this training, we will present a unique approach that combines malware analysis with the detection of Command and Control (C2) servers and landing pages, using the Roaming Mantis campaign as a case study.

**Overview:**

Roaming Mantis is a sophisticated cyber campaign that employs DNS hijacking to distribute various threats, including web-mining, phishing, and malicious Android applications. This campaign was first discovered by McAfee and later named by Kaspersky in April 2018. Despite being identified, Roaming Mantis remains highly active and continues to evolve rapidly.

**Training Objectives:**

Our hands-on training, which is over 80% practical, aims to provide analysts and researchers with a comprehensive understanding of the methods, tools, and viewpoints used in tracking and analyzing Android botnets. We believe that sharing our expertise and methodologies can help attendees develop their own effective strategies for threat detection and mitigation.

**Key Topics:**

- **Malware Analysis:** Techniques for dissecting and understanding the behavior of malicious Android applications.
- **OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence):** Utilizing publicly available information to track and identify C2 servers and landing pages.
- **APK Analysis Tools:** Introduction to and hands-on experience with tools for analyzing Android Package Kits (APKs).
- **Case Study: Roaming Mantis:** A detailed examination of the Roaming Mantis campaign, including its tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).

By the end of this course, participants will have gained valuable insights and practical skills in tracking and analyzing Android botnets, enabling them to better protect against and respond to such threats.

**Target Audience:**

This training is designed for security analysts, threat researchers, and cybersecurity professionals who are interested in enhancing their skills in malware analysis and threat intelligence.

**Duration:**

The training will be conducted over [specify duration, e.g., two days] and will include both theoretical sessions and extensive hands-on exercises.
