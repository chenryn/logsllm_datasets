User: I coded a python application which was running OK as a cron job. Later I added some libraries (e.g. pynotify and other *) because I wanted to be notified with the message describing what is happening, but it seems that cron can't run such an application.
Do you know some alternative how to run this application every five minutes? I'm using Xubuntu.

import gtk, pygtk, os, os.path, pynotify

I can run the application without cron without problems.
Cron seems to run the application but it won't show the notification message. In /var/log/cron.log there are no errors. The application executed every minute without problems.
my crontab:
*/1 * * * * /home/xralf/pythonsrc/app
thank you
Assistant: If the cron job runs as "you", and if you set the DISPLAY var (export DISPLAY=:0) you should have no issues.
