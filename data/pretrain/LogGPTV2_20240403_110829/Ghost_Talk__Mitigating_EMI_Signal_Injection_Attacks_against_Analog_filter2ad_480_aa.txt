Abstract—Electromagnetic interference (EMI) affects cir-
cuits by inducing voltages on conductors. Analog sensing of
signals on the order of a few millivolts is particularly sensitive
to interference. This work (1) measures the susceptibility of
analog sensor systems to signal injection attacks by intentional,
low-power emission of chosen electromagnetic waveforms, and
(2) proposes defense mechanisms to reduce the risks.
Our experiments use specially crafted EMI at varying power
and distance to measure susceptibility of sensors in implantable
medical devices and consumer electronics. Results show that
at distances of 1–2 m, consumer electronic devices containing
microphones are vulnerable to the injection of bogus audio
signals. Our measurements show that in free air, intentional
EMI under 10 W can inhibit pacing and induce deﬁbrillation
shocks at distances up to 1–2 m on implantable cardiac elec-
tronic devices. However, with the sensing leads and medical
devices immersed in a saline bath to better approximate the
human body, the same experiment decreased to under 5 cm.
Our defenses range from prevention with simple analog
shielding to detection with a signal contamination metric based
on the root mean square of waveform amplitudes. Our con-
tribution to securing cardiac devices includes a novel defense
mechanism that probes for forged pacing pulses inconsistent
with the refractory period of cardiac tissue.

I. INTRODUCTION
Analog sensors have increasingly become an indispens-
able part of many modern systems, ranging from smart-
phones to medical devices to closed-loop control systems.
The application layer running on these systems makes
critical decisions, including actuation based on inputs from
sensors including temperature, ﬂow, position, electrocardio-
grams, electroencephalograms, and microphones. Unfortu-
nately, analog sensors sensitive to electromagnetic interfer-
ence (EMI) can provide an unchecked entry point into other-
wise protected systems, allowing an attacker to manipulate
sensor readings without changing the underlying physical

phenomena. The modiﬁed sensed data can appear directly
at a device’s application layer, bypassing common security
mechanisms (Figure 1) and giving the attacker some level
of control over the system.
EMI affects circuits by inducing voltages on conductors
— an effect also known as “back-door” coupling [1], where
components become unintentional antennas capturing EMI
radiation [2], [3]. EMI sources can be divided into inten-
tional or unintentional, and low-power or high-power. There
is abundant work devoted to unintentional or high-power
EMI, but the effect of intentional low-power EMI for analog
signal injection has yet to be explored. Unintentional high-
power EMI sources, such as lightning strikes, electric trains,
transformers [4], and sometimes communicating radios [5]
are known to have an impact on modern circuits and analog
sensors. Unintentional low-power leaks can allow eavesdrop-
ping on a system [6] and unintentional low power sources
are also well known and accounted for in circuit designs [2].
In medicine unintentional high power EMI radiated from
tools used for procedures like electrocautery [7] and from
MRIs [8], [9] can affect cardiac implantable electrical de-
vices (CIEDs). In addition, cell phones and other modern
transmission devices have been investigated for their effect
on CIEDs [10], [11], [12] and risks to patients.
Intentional EMI at high power can disable an adversary’s
electronic components [13], [1], [14], [15]; intentional EMI

to security violations [16], but this typically requires sev-
eral volts of induced potential to succeed. Analog circuits,
however, operating on the order of a few millivolts, can be
vulnerable to interference at much lower energy levels and
can allow the injection of forged sensor readings.
This work focuses on the signal injection with intentional
low-power EMI on analog sensors. We analyze the root
causes that enable signal injection on analog sensors, demon-
strate that several commodity sensors are vulnerable to our
EMI attacks, and investigate defense strategies.
Low-Power EMI Attack Analysis. Using back-door
coupling, we design two types of EMI attacks:
1. Baseband EMI attacks inject signals within the same
frequency band as sensor readings. Thus they are effective
against analog sensors equipped with ﬁlters that attenuate
signals outside intended frequency bands.
2. Amplitude-modulated EMI attacks modulate an attack
signal on a carrier within the frequency band to which the
victim’s analog sensors respond. Since the frequency of the
EMI signal can match to the resonant frequency of a sensor,
a successful attack requires a lower transmission power than
baseband EMI attacks.
EMI Attack Validation. We demonstrated EMI attacks
on medical devices monitoring electrograms and on com-
modity electronics using microphones. Speciﬁcally, despite
proper ﬁlters in CIEDs, we successfully injected forged
signals in leads in free air, causing pacing inhibition and
deﬁbrillation from 1 to 2 m away by transmitting at about
10 W and using a simple whip monopole antenna. With the
device submerged in saline solution, the results decreased
to under 5 cm. We also found that many commodity devices
lack ﬁlters and are vulnerable to high frequency EMI signals.
Using a transmitter with a power output of less than 100 mW,
we were able to inject audio signals on microphones at a
distance of up to 1 to 2 m. Our audio signals consisted of
simple sinusoids, Dual-Tone Multiple Frequency (DTMF)
signals commonly used in modern telephony, and arbitrary
waveforms such as human speech and music.
Mitigation. While defenses against EMI attacks exist, we
nonetheless found many devices vulnerable. We applied and
measured the attenuation of our attack signal by known de-
fenses including shielding, ﬁltering and common mode noise
rejection. Those techniques ameliorate but do not eliminate
the injected EMI signals. Thus, we propose software-based
defenses that take advantage of the intended signal’s physical
proximity to the sensor and the ability to elicit feedback to
discriminate between real and forged signals.
II. SENSOR AND EMI ATTACK OVERVIEW
A. Threat model
This work considers an adversary that has prior knowl-
edge of the device under attack, including the speciﬁc make
and model of the device — information that could be

risk of interference because it is the sensing region for those devices.
obtained via other channels including social engineering. For
devices in widespread use, the attacker may even possess a
device of the same model.
In addition, we assume that an adversary has access to
commodity hardware (e.g., laptops, audio ampliﬁers, and
signal generators) sufﬁcient to mount attacks from a distance
of several meters. Although the range can be increased with
specialized equipment, this work aims to demonstrate the
attack feasibility and focuses on techniques that can bypass
ﬁlters and common defenses; we do not directly address the
transmission power. A well-funded adversary could launch
longer-range attacks using high power ampliﬁers and high-
gain antennas.
The adversary’s goal is to manipulate sensor readings
by injecting signals directly into the analog circuit without
altering the sensed physical phenomenon. Thus, if s(t) rep-
resents the readings produced by the sensor in isolation, the
adversary’s goal is to inject a malicious signal, m(t), such
that the sensor readings become s(cid:48)(t) = m(t) + s(t), where
m(t) >> s(t), and m(t) dominates with s(cid:48)(t) ≈ m(t).
B. Sensor background
Sensors are transducers that convert physical phenomena
such as light, temperature, or sound into electrical signals.
Cardiac activity produces electrical signals that can be
sensed directly. This work considers sensors that produce
voltage signals in the Very Low Frequency (VLF) band
(1 Hz –30 kHz) or lower. The output is then ampliﬁed, pos-
sibly ﬁltered, and digitized before delivery to an application
running on the microprocessor (Figure 3). The frequency
range of the output is the sensor’s baseband. Sensors may
be sensitive to EMI in their baseband and without ﬁlters,
they may be sensitive to EMI outside of the baseband
too. This work thus divides sensors into two categories:
baseband response and high-frequency response. The rest
of this paper examines one type of sensor from each of the
above categories.

  Figure 3. The typical components of an audio sensing device. EMI attacks
target the circuit just before ampliﬁcation, where the signal is the weakest.
1) Cardiac medical devices: Cardiac devices including
external electrocardiogram machines (ECGs) and cardiac
implantable electrical devices (CIEDs) measure cardiac sig-
nals and may deliver therapies as needed. The measured
signals, called electrograms, pass through a set of analog
ﬁlters to remove unwanted frequency components before
being ampliﬁed and digitized. As a result, medical de-
vices are more resilient against high-frequency interference
but may still be sensitive to baseband interference. The
ANSI/AAMI PC69-2007 [17] electromagnetic compatibility
standard, summarized in Figure 2 indicates that low fre-
quency EM radiation has a signiﬁcantly greater likelihood
to interfere with CIEDs.
The standard separates EMI into three zones. Zone 2 is
where many modern devices may emit, including mobile
phones [18], [19] and electronic article surveillance (EAS)
systems [20]. Zone 1 is the operation and sensing zone for
CIEDs which cannot implement aggressive ﬁltering because
they would also attenuate the intended signal.
2) Microphones: Microphones are part of audio capture
circuits and transform acoustic waves into voltage signals.
Those signals are then ampliﬁed and digitized by an analog-
to-digital converter (ADC) before reaching a microprocessor
(Figure 3). Audio capture circuits have a baseband ranging
from 20 Hz to 20 kHz, but in commodity electronics, they
tend to lack ﬁlters. In addition, because the expected signal
prior to the ampliﬁer is on the order of 1 mV, low-power
EMI can cause injected signals to appear in the circuit before
the ampliﬁcation stage. Those signals, if strong enough can
dominate the legitimate signals.
C. Manipulating sensor readings
Electromagnetic signals can cause voltage differences to
appear across conductors placed in the vicinity. An attacker
could use this mechanism to inject unwanted signals into a
system. The amplitude of the induced voltage depends on the
strength of the electromagnetic ﬁeld, with low-power EMI
typically causing millivolt ﬂuctuations. Digital components
are typically well-protected because they operate at multi-
volt levels. For example, a microprocessor operating on 2 V
can represent the bit ‘1’ with voltages above 1 V, and the
bit ’0’ with voltages below that threshold. Analog sensors,
however, are more sensitive to millivolt ﬂuctuations.
To manipulate sensor readings with EMI, an adversary
must ﬁnd a suitable emission frequency. Each circuit com-
ponent has its own operation frequency band within which

ﬁcation on the analog circuit. The electromagnetic interference attack can

a signal pass with little attenuation. Circuit components in
series with different operation frequency bands can result in
the elimination of a large portion of the frequency bands
suitable for signal injection attacks. For example, a short
conductor may work well for high-frequency coupling, but
a low-pass ﬁlter in the downstream path may eliminate all
high-frequency components. In such a case, injecting EMI
signals in the baseband will likely yield better results.
D. Baseband EMI attacks
Systems that include low-pass ﬁlters severely attenuate
high frequency signals. Thus,
to survive those ﬁlters, a
malicious injected signal m(t) must be in the baseband: the
emitted EMI v(t) must be in the same frequency range as
m(t), as shown in the center of Figure 4. Baseband injection
requires relatively high power emission because circuits do
not normally respond well to radiation in those frequencies.
Some pacemakers can detect cardiac tissue signals
by looking for large voltage change rates (slew rates),
dv/dt [21] and voltage thresholds [22]. Sending a high-
amplitude signal could obscure the actual signal due to
automatic threshold or gain control [22]. High-amplitude
but benign sources of radiation in those frequencies have
been reported to affect some devices [23], [24], but lower-
amplitude targetted waveforms have not received much
attention.
E. Amplitude-modulated EMI attacks
Amplitude-modulated EMI attacks target systems lack-
ing ﬁlters and are thus more likely to respond to high-
frequency signals. Circuits may contain components that
couple efﬁciently to signals in the MHz and GHz range. An
adversary can thus tune the transmitter to a carrier frequency
