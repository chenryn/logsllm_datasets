### Marketplace Strategies and Vendor Behavior Analysis

#### Introduction
Sellers often diversify their presence across multiple marketplaces as a strategic hedge against potential takedowns or failures. For example, a seller named Sally might operate under different nicknames on various platforms: "Sally" on Silk Road 2, "sally" on Agora, and "Easy Sally" on Evolution. She might even have a second account on Evolution, "The Real Easy Sally."

#### Defining and Linking Aliases
We formally define an **alias** as a unique (vendor nickname, marketplace) pair. To link different aliases to the same vendor, we use the following heuristics:
1. **Case Insensitivity**: Nicknames that differ only in case (e.g., "Sally" and "sally") are considered to belong to the same person.
2. **InfoDesk Feature**: We use the InfoDesk feature of the Grams "DarkNet Markets" search engine to further link vendor nicknames. This step filters out common substrings (e.g., "weed," "dealer," "Amsterdam") used by many vendors.
3. **PGP Key Consistency**: Aliases claiming to use the same PGP key are linked. Our linking strategy is conservative, meaning minor variations like "Sally" and "Sally!" will not be linked unless they share a common PGP key.

Using these heuristics, from a total of 29,258 unique aliases observed, we identified 9,386 distinct sellers.

#### Time-Based Alias Activity
In Figure 9, we show the number of vendors with one, two, or up to six active aliases at any given time T. An alias is considered active if it has at least one listing available before and after T. The plot is incomplete because it only includes data from marketplaces that were crawled and parsed at each time point.

For instance, the early data show a monopoly due to having only Silk Road data, even though Black Market Reloaded was also active. In summer 2013, a few vendors began selling simultaneously on Silk Road and Atlantis. The practice of maintaining multiple accounts on several sites became more common in 2014, following the failure of many marketplaces in Fall 2013, including Silk Road. The significant increase in July 2014 corresponds to the inclusion of the large Evolution marketplace. The decrease in late 2014 is attributed to Operation Onymous, which took down Silk Road 2.0 and other secondary marketplaces.

#### Survival Functions
To complement this analysis, we examine the survival functions of aliases and sellers, reported in Figure 10. The survival function \( p(\tau) \) represents the probability that a given seller (or alias) observed at time \( t \) remains active at time \( t + \tau \). Using a Kaplan-Meier estimator, we find that half of the sellers are present for 220 days or less, and half of the aliases exist for 172 days or less. Interestingly, about 10% of sellers remain active throughout the entire measurement interval, and approximately 25% of all sellers are long-term, remaining active for years.

#### Transaction Volumes
To understand vendor operations, we aggregated unique feedback left for products and calculated the total transaction value for each vendor. Figure 11 shows the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of sellers by the total value of their transactions. About 70% of sellers never sold more than $1,000 worth of products, while 18% sold between $1,000 and $10,000. Only 2% of vendors managed to sell more than $100,000. Notably, 35 sellers sold over $1,000,000, and the top 1% of vendors accounted for 51.5% of the total transaction volume. Some high-volume sellers, like "SuperTrips" and "Nod" from Silk Road, have been arrested, and the numbers released in connection with these arrests are consistent with our findings.

#### Vendor Diversity
We define a **successful seller** as one who has sold more than $10,000. This allows us to focus on vendors with a meaningful impact on the marketplace ecosystem. We categorize the items sold by each vendor and aggregate by category. Let \( C \) be the set of normalized item categories for each seller, and \( S \) be the set of all sellers. We define the **diversity coefficient** for a seller \( s_j \) as:

\[
c_d = 1 - \max_i C_i(s_j)
\]

where \( C_i(s_j) \) is the normalized value of the \( i \)-th category for seller \( j \). The diversity coefficient measures how invested a seller is in their most popular category, with \( c_d \in [0,1] \).

Figure 12 plots the CDF of the diversity coefficient for successful sellers. We identify three types of sellers:
1. **Highly Specialized**: Coefficient between 0 and 0.1, selling exactly one type of product. About half of all sellers are highly specialized, often selling cannabis, digital goods, or other specific categories.
2. **Moderately Diversified**: Coefficient between 0.1 and 0.5, specializing in two or three types of products, often recreational and club drugs.
3. **Broadly Diversified**: Coefficient greater than 0.5, selling a variety of items, possibly through networks or arbitrage.

#### PGP Deployment
We conclude by examining vendor security practices, specifically the availability of valid PGP keys. From our dataset, we extracted 7,717 PGP keys, most of which are of appropriate length. We did not find any keys with common primes, suggesting proper use of GPG software and good random number generators.

Figure 13 shows the fraction of vendors with at least one usable PGP key over time. Despite improvements, PGP deployment is not universal. In the original Silk Road, only about 2/3 to 3/4 of vendors had a valid PGP key. During the 2013 upheaval, PGP deployment was low but increased in January 2014. After Operation Onymous, adoption was even higher, particularly on marketplaces like Evolution and Agora, which supported PGP use and were more resilient against takedowns.

### Discussion
This study raises important points for validation, ethics, and public policy. Ground truth is rarely available, making validation challenging. However, limited information, such as evidence from the Ross Ulbricht trial, can be used for spot-checking estimates.
