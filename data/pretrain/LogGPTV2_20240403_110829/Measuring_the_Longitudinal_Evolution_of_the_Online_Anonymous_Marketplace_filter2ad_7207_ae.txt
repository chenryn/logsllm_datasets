marketplaces; in fact, it is probably a desirable strategy
to hedge against marketplace take-downs or failures. As
a result, a given seller, Sally, may have multiple vendor
accounts on several marketplaces: Sally may sell on Silk
Road 2 as “Sally,” on Agora as “sally” and on Evolution
as “Easy Sally;” she may even have a second Evolution
account (“The Real Easy Sally”).
We formally deﬁne an alias as a unique (vendor nick-
name, marketplace) pair, and link different aliases to
the same vendor using the combination of the follow-
ing three heuristics. We ﬁrst consider vendor nicknames
on different marketplaces with only case differences as
belonging to the same person (e.g., “Sally” and “sally”).
We then use the InfoDesk feature of the Grams “DarkNet
Markets” search engine [2] to further link various ven-
dor nicknames.7 We ﬁlter out vendor nicknames consist-
ing only of a common substring (e.g., “weed,” “dealer,”
“Amsterdam,” ...) used by many vendors prior to con-
ducting the search. Finally, we link all vendor accounts
that claim to be using the same PGP key. Clearly, our
linking strategy is very conservative – in the sense that
minor variations like “Sally” and “Sally!” will not be
linked absent a common PGP key.
Using this set of heuristics, from a total of 29,258
unique aliases observed across our entire measurement
interval, we obtain a list of 9,386 sellers. In Figure 9, we
show, over time, the number of vendors that have one,
two or up to six aliases active at any given time T (where
we use the same deﬁnition of “active” as earlier, i.e., the
alias has at least one listing available before and after T ).
The plot is by deﬁnition incomplete since we can only
take into account, for each time t, the marketplaces that
we have crawled (and parsed) at time t.
For instance, the earlier part of the data show a com-
plete monopoly: this is not surprising since we only have
data for Silk Road at that time, even though Black Mar-
ket Reloaded was also active at the same time. We ob-
serve in the summer of 2013 that a few vendors sell si-
multaneously on Silk Road and Atlantis, but the prac-
tice of having multiple vendor accounts on several sites
seems to only really take hold in 2014, after many mar-
ketplaces failed in the Fall of 2013 (including Silk Road,
and many of its short-lived successors). The second jump
in July 2014 corresponds to our starting to collect data
for the very large Evolution marketplace. Finally, the
decrease observed in late 2014 is due to Operation Ony-
mous [38], which – besides Silk Road 2.0 – took down a
relatively large number of secondary marketplaces, such
as Cloud 9.
Besides the relatively robust rise is the number of sell-
ers to take-downs and scams, the main takeaway from
this plot is that the majority of sellers appear to only
use one alias – but this may be a bit misleading, as (as
we will see later) a large number of vendors sell ex-
tremely limited quantities of products. An interesting
extension would be to check whether “top” vendors di-
versify across marketplaces or not.
We complement this analysis by looking into the “sur-
vivability” functions of aliases and sellers, which we re-
port in Figure 10. Here the survival function is deﬁned
as the probability p(τ) that a given seller (resp. alias)
observed at time t be still active at time t + τ. The ﬁg-
ure shows the survival function, derived from a Kaplan-
Meier estimator [24] to account for the fact that we have
7It is not clear how the Grams search engine is implemented; we
suspect the vendor directory is primarily based on manual curation.

ﬁnite measurement intervals, along with 95% conﬁdence
intervals. The key ﬁndings here are that half of the sell-
ers are only present for 220 days or less; half of the
aliases only exist for 172 days or less. More interest-
ing is the “long-tail” phenomenon we observe: a number
(more than 10%) of sellers have been active throughout
the entire measurement interval. More generally approx-
imately 25% of all sellers are “in it for the long run,”
and remain active (with various aliases on various mar-
ketplaces) for years.
Volumes per vendor
In an effort to obtain a more
clear understanding of how vendors operate, we aggre-
gated unique feedback left for products by vendor. We
used this to calculate the total value of the transactions
for items sold by each vendor and then grouped these
vendor aliases to yield the total value of transactions for
each seller. Figure 11 plots the CDF of sellers by the to-
tal value of their transactions. About 70% of all sellers
never managed to sell more than $1,000 worth of prod-
Figure 12: Vendor diversity
ucts. Another 18% of sellers were observed to sell be-
tween $1,000 and $10,000 but only about 2% of ven-
dors managed to sell more than $100,000.
In fact, 35
sellers were observed selling over $1,000,000 worth of
product and the top 1% most successful vendors were re-
sponsible for 51.5% of all the volume transacted. Some
of these sellers, like “SuperTrips” (or to a lesser extent,
“Nod”) from Silk Road, have been arrested, and numbers
released in connection with these arrests are consistent
with our ﬁndings [4, 6].
There is a clear discrepancy between sellers that ex-
periment in the marketplaces and those who manage to
leverage it to operate a successful business. Going for-
ward, we deﬁne any seller that we have observed selling
in excess of $10,000 to be successful. This allows us
to draw conclusions only about vendors that have had a
meaningful impact on the marketplace ecosystem. Now
that we know how much sellers are selling, we wish to
understand what they are selling. Once again we group
feedback by vendor but this time we also use the classi-
ﬁer to categorize the items that were being sold and ag-
gregate by category. Let C be the set of normalized item
categories for each seller and S be the set of all sellers
across all marketplaces. So, |C| = 16, and |S | = 9,386.
Deﬁne Ci(s j) as the normalized value of the i-th category
for seller j such that ∀s j ∈ S, ∑|C|
i=1 Ci(s j) = 1. Then,
we deﬁne the coefﬁcient of diversity for a seller s j as:
i (cid:30)Ci(s j)(cid:29)(cid:28) |C|
cd =(cid:31)1− max
Intuitively, the coefﬁcient of diversity is measuring
how invested a seller is into their most popular category,
normalized so that cd ∈ [0,1]. When evaluating the cate-
gories that different sellers are invested in, it only makes
sense to consider successful sellers as less signiﬁcant
sellers are volatile and greatly inﬂuenced by an individ-
ual sale in some category.

Agora that sold more than $10,000 total. From Figure 12
we argue that there are roughly three types of sellers. The
ﬁrst type of seller with a coefﬁcient of diversity between
0 and 0.1 is highly specialized, and sells exactly one type
of product. About half of all sellers are highly special-
ized and indicates that the seller has access to a steady
long-term supply of some type of product. About one
third of all vendors who specialize sell cannabis, another
third sell digital goods, and the last third sell in the var-
ious other categories. While digital goods is a relatively
small share of the total marketplace ecosystem, it tends
to attract vendors that specialize. This is likely due to
the domain expertise required for actions such as manu-
facturing fake IDs or stealing credit cards. The second
type of seller has a diversity coefﬁcient of between 0.1
and 0.5 and generally specializes in two or three types of
products. The most common two categories to simulta-
neously specialize in are ecstasy and psychedelics – i.e.,
primarily recreational and club drugs. The third type of
vendor has a diversity coefﬁcient greater than 0.5 and
has no specialty but rather sells a variety of items. These
types of sellers may be networks of users with access to
many different sources, or may be involved in arbitrage
between markets.
PGP deployment We conclude our discussion of ven-
dor behavior by looking in more detail at their security
practices. While we cannot easily assess their overall
operational security, we consider a very simple proxy for
security behavior:
the availability of a valid PGP key.
From our data set, we extracted 7,717 PGP keys. Most
vendors use keys of appropriate length, even though we
did observe a couple of oddities (e.g., a 2,047-bit key!)
that might indicate an incorrect use of the software. In-
spired by Heninger et al. [20] and Lenstra et al. [25] we
checked all pairs of keys to determine whether or not
they had common primes. We did not ﬁnd any, which
either suggests that GPG software was always properly
used and with a good random number generator, or, more
likely, that our dataset is too small to contain evidence of
weak keys.
We then plot in Figure 13 the fraction of vendors, over
time, that have (at least) one usable PGP key. We take
an extremely inclusive view of PGP deployment here: as
long as a vendor has advertised a valid PGP key for one
or her active aliases, we consider they are using PGP. As
vendors deal with highly sensitive information such as
postal delivery addresses of their customers, we would
expect close to 100% deployment. We see that, despite
improvements, this is not the case. In the original Silk
Road, only approximately 2/3 to 3/4 of vendors had a
valid PGP key listed. During the upheaval of the 2013
Fall, with many marketplaces opening and shutting down
quickly, we see that PGP deployment is very low. When
the situation stabilizes in January 2014, we observe an

increase in PGP adoption;
interestingly, after Opera-
tion Onymous, adoption seems even higher, which can
be construed as an evolutionary argument: marketplaces
that support and encourage PGP use by their sellers (such
as Evolution and Agora) might have been also more se-
cure in other respects, and more resilient against take-
downs. Shortly before the Evolution shutdown, PGP de-
ployment on Agora and Evolution was close to 90%.
5 Discussion
A study of this kind brings up a number of important
discussion points. We focus here on what we consider
are the most salient ones: validation, ethics, and potential
public policy take-aways.
5.1 Validation
Scientiﬁc measurements should be amenable to valida-
tion. Unfortunately, here, ground truth is rarely avail-
able, which in turn makes validation extremely difﬁcult.
Marketplace operators indeed generally do not publish
metrics such as seller numbers or trafﬁc volumes. How-
ever, in certain cases, we have limited information that
we can use for spot-checking estimates.
