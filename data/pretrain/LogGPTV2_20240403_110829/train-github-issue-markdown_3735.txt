To promote the use of CommonJS and ES6 modules, when you export a default export with no other exports, both `module.exports` and `exports["default"]` are set. 

I found this behavior to be counterintuitive: it works as expected until you add more exports, which can lead to unexpected results.

This issue could be resolved by setting `module.exports` to the default export first, and then adding any additional exports using `module.exports.doSomething = doSomething`. This approach would ensure consistency and avoid unexpected behaviors.
