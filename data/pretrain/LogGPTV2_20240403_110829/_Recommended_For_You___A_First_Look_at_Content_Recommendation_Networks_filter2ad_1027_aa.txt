## Abstract
Content Recommendation Networks (CRNs) have become a significant part of the online advertising landscape, responsible for the widgets that display links under headlines like "Recommended For You" and "Things You Might Like." While CRNs are popular with publishers, they face criticism from users and regulators for promoting low-quality content and failing to clearly label sponsored links as advertisements. This study provides an in-depth analysis of five major CRNs, examining their web presence, labeling practices, and advertiser profiles. Our findings indicate that CRNs still do not adequately disclose the paid nature of their sponsored content, suggesting the need for further intervention to protect online users.

## 1. Introduction
The online advertising ecosystem has evolved significantly, with various ad formats being tested and adopted. Beyond traditional display and keyword ads, new formats such as native, social, and video ads have emerged. One format that has seen substantial growth is Content Recommendation Networks (CRNs). These networks provide widgets filled with links, often labeled as "Recommended For You" or "Things You Might Like," which can include both first-party content and third-party sponsored content. Publishers earn revenue when users click on these sponsored links, with the revenue split between the CRN and the publisher.

The growth of CRNs is driven by the services they offer to publishers, including ready-made recommendation engines and additional revenue streams. However, CRNs have faced criticism from users and regulators. Users complain about the low-quality and misleading nature of the content promoted by CRNs, while regulators in the US and Europe have criticized CRNs for not prominently labeling sponsored links as advertisements.

In this study, we examine five of the largest CRNs: Outbrain, Taboola, Revcontent, Gravity, and ZergNet. We analyze their web presence, how their recommendations are labeled, and who their advertisers are. Our findings highlight ongoing issues with disclosure and the quality of advertised content, suggesting the need for further regulatory and industry intervention.

## 2. Background and Related Work
### 2.1 The Online Ad Ecosystem
The online advertising ecosystem, particularly the display and keyword ad markets, has been extensively studied. Researchers have examined the mobile advertising space, mapped the online ad landscape, and documented the proliferation of tracking mechanisms. Recent studies have also shown that tracking data and revenue are concentrated among the largest ad networks.

### 2.2 Content Recommendation Networks
CRNs, also known as Content Discovery Networks, first appeared in 2006 with the founding of Outbrain, followed closely by Taboola in 2007. These networks provide HTML widgets that recommend content to users, displaying both first-party and third-party sponsored content. Publishers can customize these widgets, and advertisers pay for clicks on their sponsored links. CRNs have faced controversies over the labeling of sponsored content and the promotion of spammy and scammy links.

## 3. Methodology
### 3.1 Choosing Publishers
We selected 500 websites for our study, including 289 top publishers from Alexa's "News and Media" categories and 211 randomly sampled sites from the Alexa Top-1M. This sample provides a balanced representation of high-traffic and lower-ranked websites.

### 3.2 Crawling and Parsing
We developed XPath queries to detect and extract information from CRN widgets on the selected websites. Our crawler visited the homepage and up to 20 pages per site, refreshing each page three times to ensure comprehensive data collection. The crawl was conducted between February 26 and March 4, 2016.

### Definitions
We extracted data related to the number of widgets per page, the links within each widget, and the headlines and disclosures. Links were labeled as recommended if they pointed to the hosting publisher and as ads if they pointed to third parties.

## 4. Analysis
### 4.1 General Statistics
Our analysis reveals that CRNs serve 2.5 times more advertisements than recommendations per page, on average. Additionally, 12% of CRN widgets mix sponsored and non-sponsored links, potentially confusing users.

### 4.2 Labeling Practices
Only 15% of CRN widgets with ads include clear labels such as "sponsored," "promoted," or "ad." Although 94% of widgets include some form of disclosure, the quality of these disclosures varies widely across CRNs.

### 4.3 Advertiser Quality
Advertiser quality varies significantly. For example, 60% of Gravity's advertisers are in the Alexa Top-10K, while 40% of Revcontent's advertisers registered their domain names less than a year ago.

### 4.4 Ad Topics
The most frequently advertised topics on CRNs include dubious financial services and salacious celebrity gossip, confirming many of the content quality criticisms leveled against CRNs.

## Conclusion
Despite past criticisms, our findings show that CRNs still fail to adequately disclose the paid nature of their sponsored content. This suggests the need for additional intervention from industry trade groups and regulators to promote best practices and protect online users.
