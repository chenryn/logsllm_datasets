ABSTRACT
One advertising format that has grown signiﬁcantly in
recent years are known as Content Recommendation
Networks (CRNs). CRNs are responsible for the wid-
gets full of links that appear under headlines like “Rec-
ommended For You” and “Things You Might Like”. Al-
though CRNs have become quite popular with publish-
ers, users complain about the low-quality of content pro-
moted by CRNs, while regulators in the US and Europe
have faulted CRNs for failing to label sponsored links
as advertisements.
In this study, we present a ﬁrst look at ﬁve of the
largest CRNs, including their footprint on the web, how
their recommendations are labeled, and who their ad-
vertisers are. Our ﬁndings reveal that CRNs still fail
to prominently disclose the paid nature of their spon-
sored content. This suggests that additional interven-
tion is necessary to promote accepted best-practices in
the nascent CRN marketplace, and ultimately protect
online users.

INTRODUCTION
As the online advertising ecosystem has grown and
matured, publishers and advertisers have experimented
with many diﬀerent advertising formats. Although dis-
play ads (a.k.a. banner ads) and keyword ads (a.k.a.
search ads) are perhaps the most well known ad for-
mats, advertisers continue to experiment with new for-
mats like native, social, and video ads (including 6 sec-
ond mini-videos known as “bumpers” [11]).

tion Networks (CRNs). CRNs are responsible for the
widgets full of links that appear under headlines like
“Recommended For You” and “Things You Might Like”.
These widgets typically provide links to two types of
content: 1) recommended content from the ﬁrst-party
publisher (i.e., the owner of the website that has embed-
ded the widget), and 2) sponsored content from third-
parties. Advertisers pay when users click on the spon-
sored links, and the revenue is split between the CRN
and the publisher.
The growth of CRNs has been fueled by the com-
pelling services they oﬀer to publishers. First, CRNs
provide ready-made recommendation engines that help
publishers promote their own content to visitors. Sec-
ond, publishers earn revenue when users click on third-
party sponsored content. To put things in perspective:
the largest CRNs, Outbrain and Taboola, claim to serve
billions of recommendations per month to between 400–
550M unique users, and earned $240M and $200M in
revenue, respectively, in 2014 [9, 12].
However, CRNs have come under ﬁre from users and
regulators. Users have vocally complained about the
“click-bait” headlines that are often promoted by CRNs,
or by deceptive “bait-and-switch” sponsored links that
appear to be content, but instead lead to product
advertisements [9]. Some advertisers have even used
CRNs to openly advertise scams (e.g., get rich quick
schemes) [18]. Furthermore, regulators in the US and
Europe have faulted CRNs for failing to prominently la-
bel sponsored links as advertisements, and encouraged
them to change their business practices [7, 20].
In this study, we present a ﬁrst look at CRNs, includ-
ing their footprint on the web, how their recommenda-
tions are labeled, and who their advertisers are. We
focus on ﬁve of the largest CRNs: Outbrain, Taboola,
Revcontent, Gravity, and ZergNet. To study these ser-
vices, we crawled CRN widgets from 500 websites in
2016, including 289 top publishers (e.g., CNN and USA
Today) and 211 random sites from the Alexa Top-1M.
In total, we collected 130,996 ads and 53,202 recom-
mendations from ﬁve CRNs, which form the basis of
our study. Using this dataset, we make the following
key observations:
17Figure 1: Sponsored links with thumbnail images

sored links from Outbrain.
• CRNs serve 2.5× more advertisements than rec-
ommendations per page, on average. Further-
more, 12% of CRN widgets mix sponsored and
non-sponsored links, which may confuse users.
• 11% of CRN widgets that contain ads do not have
a headline, and of those that do, only 15% include
words like “sponsored”, “promoted”, or “ad”. Fur-
thermore, although 94% of CRN widgets include a
nominal disclosure, the substantive quality of these
disclosures varies greatly across CRNs.
• Advertiser quality varies widely across CRNs. Al-
most 60% of Gravity’s advertisers are in the Alexa
Top-10K, while 40% of Revcontent’s advertisers
registered their domain name <1 year ago.
• The most frequently advertised topics on CRNs
include dubious ﬁnancial services and salacious
celebrity gossip. This conﬁrms many of the con-
tent quality criticisms leveled against CRNs in the
press [9, 17, 18].
Although CRNs have been criticized in the past for
the quality of their content, and for failing to promi-
nently disclose the paid nature of their sponsored con-
tent [7, 20], our ﬁndings reveal that these problems are
still widespread. This suggests that additional interven-
tion is necessary from industry trade groups and regu-
lators to promote accepted best-practices in the nascent
CRN marketplace, and ultimately protect online users.

2. BACKGROUND AND RELATED
WORK
We begin by setting the stage for our study. First,
we discuss the broader online advertising ecosystem and
highlight related work. Second, we introduce Content
Recommendation Networks (CRNs).
2.1 The Online Ad Ecosystem
The online display and keyword ad ecosystem has
been well-studied by researchers. Rodriguez et al. used
anonymized data from a major European mobile career
to study the mobile advertising space [21]. Similarly,
Barford et al. used crawled data to map out the on-
line adscape and characterize the footprint of major ad
networks [2]. Others have used controlled methodolo-
gies to examine the prevalence of behaviorally targeted
ads, and the features that drive targeting [6,10]. A long
line of work has focused speciﬁcally on documenting the
proliferation of tracking mechanisms used to fuel the ad
industry [13–15, 19]. Finally, recent studies have shown
that tracking data and revenue are highly skewed to-
wards the largest ad networks [5, 8].
2.2 Content Recommendation Networks
CRNs, also known as Content Discovery Networks,
ﬁrst appeared in 2006 with the founding of Outbrain,
closely followed in 2007 by Taboola. Today, Outbrain
and Taboola’s widgets are embedded on thousands of
websites, and both companies generate hundreds of mil-
lions of dollars in revenue [12]. However, competition
in the CRN space is ﬁerce: there are many incumbent
services like Revcontent, Gravity, and ZergNet.
As the name suggests, CRNs are centered around
HTML widgets that recommend content to users. Pub-
lishers embed these widgets into their pages, and they
display two kinds of recommended content: 1) links to
content from the publisher, and 2) sponsored content
from third-parties. Figures 1 and 2 show typical wid-
gets from Revcontent and Outbrain. CRNs personalize
the recommendations shown to each individual to en-
courage engagement, although the speciﬁc mechanisms
used by each CRN for personalization are unknown.
CRNs allow publishers to customize the widgets in
various ways. This includes: choosing vertical and hori-
zontal layouts; using CSS to style the widget; displaying
thumbnail images or text-only links; and choosing how
many and what types of links to include (i.e., the frac-
tion of ﬁrst- and third-party recommendations). Pub-
lishers may also choose the headline that is shown at the
top of the widget. Figures 1 and 2 show three diﬀerent
headlines chosen by publishers.
For advertisers, CRNs oﬀer a way to promote content
across a wide range of publishers. Advertisers supply
links with accompanying text and thumbnail images to
CRNs, who then “recommend” these sponsored links to
users via their widgets. Advertisers pay each time their
sponsored links are clicked, and the revenue is split be-
tween the CRN and the publisher.
Controversy.
Recently, CRNs have been at the
center of two controversies. First, CRNs have been ac-
18cused of not properly labeling sponsored links as adver-
tisements, which may confuse and mislead users [9, 20].
For example, in Figure 1 the only disclosure is the tiny
text “Sponsored by Revcontent” in the upper-right cor-
ner of the widget; in Figure 2, the only disclosure is the
tiny “what’s this” in the bottom right of the box.
Non-uniform labeling of sponsored links is exacer-
bated by publishers’ ability to customize the CRN wid-
gets. This leads to webpages that mix sponsored and
non-sponsored links underneath misleading headlines.
As of 2014, Outbrain claims to have added more promi-
nent labeling to their sponsored links [7].
The second controversy concerns spammy links pro-
moted by CRNs.
In theory, CRNs are supposed to
be used for “content marketing”,
i.e., promotion of
blog posts, articles, videos, etc.
In practice, CRNs
have been used to spread links leading to spam and
scams [9, 17], which echoes similar issues on traditional
ad networks [22]. As of 2012, Outbrain claims to have
increased their pre-ﬁltering of content to eliminate spam
(causing their revenue to fall 25%) [18].
In contrast,
Taboola relies on users to ﬂag spammy content [16].
3. METHODOLOGY
In this study, we focus on ﬁve CRNs: Outbrain,
Taboola, Revcontent, Gravity, and ZergNet. Our goal
is to answer fundamental questions about these CRNs,
including: where do their widgets appear? How are ads
disclosed to users? and Who advertises on these ser-
vices? To answer these questions, we need large-scale
data gathered from CRN widgets.
In this section, we outline our data collection method-
ology. First, we discuss how we selected publishers to
crawl, followed by how we gathered data from each site.
Finally, we present deﬁnitions that we will use through-
out our analysis.
3.1 Choosing Publishers
The ﬁrst step in our study is choosing websites to
crawl. CRNs cater to large publishers by helping them
recommend their content to users (in addition to being
a source of ad revenue). Armed with this intuition, we
collected the list of 1,240 publisher websites that appear
in Alexa’s 8 “News and Media” categories in February
2016. Example categories include News, Business News
and Media, and Health News and Media. We crawled
all 1,240 websites to identify publishers that may em-
bed CRN widgets. We randomly visited ﬁve pages per
website1 and analyzed the generated HTTP requests.
Out of 1,240 publishers, 289 contacted at least one of
the ﬁve CRNs.
However, examining large publishers alone may re-
sult in a biased sample of CRN widgets. Thus, we also
analyzed the HTTP requests generated by all sites in
the Alexa Top-1M that we had collected for an earlier
1We only included pages from the same domain.
study [3]. Out of 5,124 websites from the Alexa Top-1M
that contacted a CRN, we randomly sampled 211.
We focus on these 500 publishers in this study: 211
randomly sampled from Alexa Top-1M, and all 289 from
our Alexa “News and Media” catgories crawl2. This
sample gives us a balance of top media and news web-
sites, as well as lower-ranked websites.
3.2 Crawling and Parsing
Now that we have chosen 500 publishers, our next
step is to collect samples of CRN widgets. To do this,
we manually developed a set of XPath queries that cor-
respond to speciﬁc widgets from our ﬁve target CRNs.
These XPaths serve the dual purpose of allowing us to
detect the presence of widgets in webpages, as well as
extract speciﬁc information from the widgets. In total,
we developed 12 XPaths, with most (7) targeting Out-
brain, since they have the widest diversity of widgets.
Two example XPath queries are:
• Outbrain: //a[@class=‘ob-dynamic-rec-link’]
• ZergNet: //div[@class=‘zergentity’]
Our crawler works as follows: we visit the homepage
of a publisher p, and then proceed to crawl links that
point to p until either all links on the homepage are ex-
hausted, or we ﬁnd 20 pages that include CRN widgets.
We also crawl one additional link that points to p from
each of the 20 pages, to add another level of depth to
our traversal. Finally, our crawler refreshes all 41 pages
(i.e., homepage, depth-one, and depth-two pages) three
times, to ensure that we enumerate all ads and recom-
mendations oﬀered by the CRNs [10]. The crawler saves
all HTML from traversed pages. The crawl was done
between February 26–March 4, 2016.
Deﬁnitions.
Using our XPath queries, we extract
speciﬁc pieces of data related to CRNs from our raw
HTML. This includes the number of widgets per page,
and all links in each widget. We label each link as rec-
ommended if it points to the publisher hosting the wid-
get, and as an ad if it points to a third-party (i.e., it
is a sponsored recommendation). We also extract the
headline of each widget (e.g., the “Trending Today” text
in Figure 1) as well as any disclosures (e.g., the “Spon-
sored by Revcontent” text in Figure 1). Note that not
all widgets have headlines or disclosures.
4. ANALYSIS
In this section, we analyze our dataset in order to gain
a better understanding of the CRN ecosystem. First,
we present general statistics about the online footprint
of CRNs and the functionality of their widgets. Second,
we examine the headlines of CRN widgets, and whether
paid sponsorships are being clearly disclosed. Third, we
brieﬂy look at how CRNs target advertisements based
on context and geography. Fourth, we investigate the

excluded pornographic sites from the samples.
