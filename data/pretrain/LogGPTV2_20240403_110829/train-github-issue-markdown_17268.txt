At the moment you can use hugging face's mask filling pipeline to predict 1
masked token in a sentence using the below:
    !pip install -q transformers
    from __future__ import print_function
    import ipywidgets as widgets
    from transformers import pipeline
    nlp_fill = pipeline('fill-mask')
    nlp_fill("I am going to guess  in this sentence")
The request is that you also add the ability to predict N masked tokens rather
than only 1 masked token. So that for example if the sentence is `"I am going
to make   for breakfast"` then the model might predict "fried
eggs" for the 2 masked tokens
