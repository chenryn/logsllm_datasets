**Current Behavior**
The `DatePipe` with the format `'M/d/y hh:mm a'` works correctly in Chrome. However, in IE11 and Edge, it produces an incorrect result, such as '12/17/2016 09:12/17/2016 9:56:15 PM PM'.

**Expected Behavior**
The `DatePipe` should produce the same result, such as '2/17/2016 09:55 PM', in IE11 and Edge as it does in Chrome.
