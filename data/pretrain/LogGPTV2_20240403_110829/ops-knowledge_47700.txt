User: I'm running Spyder on Windows connecting remotely to and Amazon EC2 ipython kernel. Whenever I run some operations that take more than a few seconds to run, I get the repeated message

It seems the kernel died unexpectedly. Use 'Restart kernel' to
  continue using this console.

But my kernel is all fine and dandy. Sometimes I have to press Enter repeatedly to make it snap out of it, other times I have to restart the Spyder console and connect to my still-alive kernel.
Any tips? Is there a way to disable the kernel-death check, or increasing the timeout?
Thanks! :)
Assistant: I often have the same problem, the easiest and fastest fix I have for you at the moment, is running the code in a new dedicated python console every time. this can easily be done by:
1) click the run settings icon (the wrench with green play/run buttton in the top of your screen)
2) Select the 2nd option (execute in a new dedicated python console)
3) press ok
This will automatically run the code in a new console next time you press the run file button (f5), and should prevent the error message.
