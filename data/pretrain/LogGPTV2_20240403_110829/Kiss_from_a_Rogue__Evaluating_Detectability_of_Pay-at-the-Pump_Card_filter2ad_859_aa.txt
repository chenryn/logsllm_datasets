Abstract—Credit and debit cards enable ﬁnancial transactions
at unattended “pay-at-the-pump” gas station terminals across
North America. Attackers discreetly open these pumps and
install skimmers, which copy sensitive card data. While EMV
(“chip-and-PIN”) has made substantial
inroads in traditional
retailers, such systems have virtually no deployment at pay-
at-the-pump terminals due to dramatically higher costs and
logistical/regulatory constraints, leaving consumers vulnerable in
these contexts. In an effort to improve security, station owners
have deployed security indicators such as low-cost tamper-evident
seals, and technologists have developed skimmer detection apps
for mobile phones. Not only do these solutions put the onus on
consumers to notice and react to security concerns at the pump,
but the efﬁcacy of these solutions has not been measured. In
this paper, we evaluate the indicators available to consumers
to detect skimmers. We perform a comprehensive teardown
of all known skimmer detection apps for iOS and Android
devices, and then conduct a forensic analysis of real-world gas
pump skimmer hardware recovered by multiple law enforcement
agencies. Finally, we analyze anti-skimmer mechanisms deployed
by pump owners/operators, and augment this investigation with
an analysis of skimmer reports and accompanying security
measures collected by the Florida Department of Agriculture
and Consumer Services over four years, making this the most
comprehensive long-term study of such devices. Our results show
that common gas pump security indicators are not only ineffective
at empowering consumers to detect tampering, but may be
providing a false sense of security. Accordingly, stronger, reliable,
inexpensive measures must be developed to protect consumers
and merchants from fraud.
I.
INTRODUCTION
Credit and debit cards are critical to the modern ﬁnancial
ecosystem. Consumers and merchants rely on the security and
convenience of these cards for fast transactions without the
need to handle cash. In North American gas stations, the
nearly-ubiquitous deployment of pay-at-the-pump has elimi-
nated the need for additional employees and allows consumers
to more quickly obtain fuel. This technology is used by
nearly three-quarters of Americans each day who purchase
gasoline [39].
The popularity of these unattended payment
terminals
has made them an attractive target for attackers seeking to
obtain sensitive payment card data. The primary means for
these attacks are internal skimmers [45], which are physical
devices that perform a man-in-the-middle attack inside the gas
pump. The deployment of EMV (“chip-and-PIN”) terminals
would appear to be a straightforward ﬁx to this problem.
However, deploying EMV can cost upwards of $15,000 USD
per pump and, due to federal safety standards, must be
inspected by a licensed technician (who are historically in short
supply) [21]. Accordingly, between the expense of replacement
and the business lost due to downtime before re-certiﬁcation,
the overwhelming majority of gas stations have elected to
continue to use magnetic stripe technology. In lieu of EMV, the
industry has instead widely deployed tamper-evident seals and
other indicators to alert consumers and employees to potential
skimming attacks. The use of these indicators represents a shift
in responsibility for detecting tampering from the operator
to the consumer. Speciﬁcally, the use of such mechanisms
assumes that consumers are able to identify and interpret
security indicators and that they can or will take appropriate
action.
In this paper, we seek to comprehensively evaluate a
single research question: do mechanisms created to alert
consumers of gas pump point-of-sale skimmers provide reliable
protection? To answer this question, we evaluate the software,
hardware, and physical security mechanisms used to attempt
to achieve these ends. In so doing, we make the following
contributions:
• Analysis of Bluetooth Skimmer Detection Apps: Recent
best practices suggest that consumers can better protect
themselves against pump skimmers through Bluetooth
skimmer detection apps. We perform a comprehensive
software teardown of all known Bluetooth skimmer detec-
tion apps in the App Store (iOS) and Google Play (An-
droid) markets. We identify the skimmer characteristics
that each app uses for detection.
• Forensic Hardware Analysis and Detection Coun-
termeasures: Through our partnerships with three law
enforcement agencies, we were able to examine six in-
ternal skimmers conﬁscated as part of separate criminal
investigations. We ﬁrst perform a comprehensive forensic
analysis and characterization of each device. We then test
the effectiveness of each app, and show that few are able
to reliably detect any skimmer. Moreover, we demonstrate
that simple evasions make it possible for skimmers to
evade detection by all apps.
• Long-Term Study of Recovered Skimmers: Using data
collected between 2015 and 2018 by the Florida Depart-
ment of Agriculture and Consumer Services, we perform
the ﬁrst long-term study of gas pump skimmers. We begin
by discussing the challenges of deploying tamper-evident
seals in this setting; the reports in this dataset demon-
strate that this legally mandated defensive mechanism is
overwhelmingly ineffective at deterring skimming attacks.
Speciﬁcally, we observe that more than 90% of annotated

reports in which gas pump skimmers are found have
approved security measures in place.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows:
Section II provides background on the problem of gas pump
skimmers; Section III details the mechanisms of skimmer
detection apps; Section IV provides a breakdown of internal
skimmers and evaluates the detection apps’ ability to detect
skimmer characteristics; Section V discusses the challenges
of deploying tamper-evident seals, and how they have largely
failed in practice; Section VI offers possible solutions and fu-
ture work; Section VII discusses related work; and Section VIII
gives concluding remarks.
II. BACKGROUND
Magnetic stripe card data is stored as unprotected plaintext.
Any reader that comes in contact with the card can obtain a
complete copy of the data, and this data can be rewritten to a
different card. Accordingly, attackers use card reading devices
(also known as skimmers) to acquire the sensitive account data
from victims’ cards.
Skimmers are produced in a variety of form factors and
can be applied in many ways to a target device [45]. We
evaluate the problem of gas pump skimming attacks, which
today—attackers
are believed to be predominantly internal
physically open the target pump, and insert
the skimmer
between the card reader module and the mainboard. This
device performs a classic man-in-the-middle attack on the
reader’s serial connection, allowing the skimmer to read and
store card data while providing the pump the same data. From
the victim’s perspective, there is no visible change to the
payment ﬂow. Figure 1 shows two skimmers we obtained from
law enforcement; we examine these and others in Section IV.
Installing these skimmers requires attackers to open an
access door to the terminal equipment and install the skimmer
without drawing suspicion from employees or other customers.
To secure pumps against these attacks, Florida statutes require
pump operators to deploy at
least one of these security
measures: a tamper-evident seal, a device that disables the
pump or payment terminal when opened, a card reader that
encrypts card data before transmission, and/or another ap-
proved control.1 Gas pump payment fraud results in millions
of dollars in losses per year in total despite costing stores
an average of $700 per year [37]. This asymmetry causes
individual stores to have low motivation to solve this problem.
The high cost of retroﬁtting newer payments technologies such
as EMV [38], high security locks, alarms, and other controls
makes deploying these solutions ﬁnancially unsound.2
To reduce the risk for attackers, some skimming devices
have a wireless data retrieval mechanism (e.g., Bluetooth) to
avoid the need to reopen the pump and to reduce the risk
of detection. The introduction of Bluetooth-enabled skimmers
fostered an arms race, which has led to the production of
smartphone apps for detecting skimmers. We analyze these

security is actual deployment, and solutions that ignore real world constraints
and incentives are rarely deployed successfully.
apps and their detection mechanisms in detail in Section III.
We evaluate these apps against skimmers conﬁscated by law
enforcement in Section IV. We examine the pervasiveness,
utility, and effectiveness of seals in Section V.
Finally, while consumers in the United States enjoy limited
liability for credit card purchases, fraudulent charges onto debit
or prepaid cards immediately remove funds (i.e., from a bank
account) until the bank releases those funds. In cases such
as debit cards, the consumer may only have a limited time
to report fraud before being fully liable for the charge, and
it may take months to regain control of contested funds (if
ever). These costs are initially absorbed by banks and payment
networks. This has motivated them to force the deployment of
EMV (at the merchants’ expense) to curb rising card fraud.
Accordingly, card fraud results in real costs to consumers and
merchants.
III. SKIMMER DETECTION APPS
Increasingly desperate to protect themselves against skim-
mers, hundreds of thousands of consumers have downloaded
skimmer detecting applications for their smart devices. Given
that some gas pump skimmers rely on Bluetooth radios to
reduce the risk to their owners of being caught while physically
retrieving these devices, such an approach is intuitive and
similar techniques have been used to detect rogue cellular
base stations [19] and Wi-Fi access points [34], [17]. However,
the efﬁcacy of these apps, which represent the only electronic
detection method available to consumers, has not previously
been measured.
A. Methodology
Using skimming-related terms (e.g., skimmer, skimmer
detection, skimming, skim, gas pump), we discovered ﬁve
Android applications in the Google Play Market and two appli-
cations in the Apple App Store that purport to detect skimmers.
For the Android applications, we downloaded and decompiled
their Dalvik bytecode using the JEB decompiler [49]. We then
examined the decompiled source of each app to determine the
mechanism they use to detect skimmers. For iOS we used
IDA Pro 7.0 [44] to view the ARM64 assembly, LLDB [42]
for debugging and breakpointing, and Frida [43] for function
interception. We used two test devices: a jailbroken iOS 10.3.2
device to decrypt the iOS IPA ﬁles using Clutch and a stock
iOS 11.3.1 device for dynamic analysis. An overview of these
results are shown in Table I. We also test these apps with real
skimmers in Section IV; below, we discuss our analysis of the
detection methods of each app.
B. Results
Skimmer Scanner (A). This app was developed based on a
SparkFun article [3]. The application is a C# Xamarin app and
is open-source. Rather than decompiling the app, we examined
the source code from GitHub [4].
This app is the most conservative in its detection mech-
anism; a series of ﬁve steps must successfully complete to
produce a red alert, the app’s most severe alert. Each of these
steps is speciﬁc to the speciﬁc skimmer model discussed in
the SparkFun article. The app ﬁrst scans for Bluetooth devices,
