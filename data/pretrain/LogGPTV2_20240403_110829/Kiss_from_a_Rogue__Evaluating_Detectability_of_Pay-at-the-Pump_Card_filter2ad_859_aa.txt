## Abstract
Credit and debit cards facilitate financial transactions at unattended "pay-at-the-pump" gas station terminals across North America. Attackers often install skimming devices inside these pumps to steal sensitive card data. While EMV ("chip-and-PIN") technology has significantly reduced fraud in traditional retail settings, its high cost and logistical challenges have prevented widespread adoption at gas stations, leaving consumers vulnerable. In response, station owners have implemented low-cost security measures such as tamper-evident seals, and technologists have developed mobile apps for detecting skimmers. However, the effectiveness of these solutions remains untested. This paper evaluates the current indicators available to consumers for detecting skimmers. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of all known skimmer detection apps for iOS and Android, perform a forensic examination of real-world skimmer hardware, and analyze anti-skimmer mechanisms deployed by pump operators. Our findings, based on four years of data from the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, reveal that common security indicators are ineffective and may provide a false sense of security. Therefore, there is a critical need for more reliable and affordable measures to protect consumers and merchants from fraud.

## 1. Introduction
Credit and debit cards are integral to the modern financial ecosystem, enabling fast and convenient transactions without the need for cash. In North American gas stations, pay-at-the-pump systems have become nearly ubiquitous, allowing consumers to quickly obtain fuel. However, these unattended payment terminals have also become attractive targets for attackers seeking to steal sensitive card data. The primary method of attack involves internal skimmers, which are physical devices installed inside the pump to intercept and store card data.

Deploying EMV ("chip-and-PIN") terminals would be an effective solution, but the high costs (up to $15,000 USD per pump) and the need for licensed technicians make this impractical for most gas stations. As a result, many stations continue to use magnetic stripe technology and rely on other security measures, such as tamper-evident seals and consumer-focused detection apps. These measures shift the responsibility for detecting tampering from the operator to the consumer, assuming that consumers can identify and respond to security indicators.

In this paper, we aim to evaluate the effectiveness of these security measures. Specifically, we address the following research question: do the mechanisms designed to alert consumers to gas pump skimmers provide reliable protection? To answer this, we analyze the software, hardware, and physical security measures used to detect skimmers. Our contributions include:

- **Analysis of Bluetooth Skimmer Detection Apps:** We perform a comprehensive teardown of all known Bluetooth skimmer detection apps in the App Store (iOS) and Google Play (Android) markets, identifying the characteristics each app uses for detection.
- **Forensic Hardware Analysis and Detection Countermeasures:** Through partnerships with three law enforcement agencies, we examine six internal skimmers confiscated during criminal investigations. We conduct a detailed forensic analysis and test the effectiveness of the detection apps, demonstrating that few can reliably detect skimmers and that simple evasions can render them ineffective.
- **Long-Term Study of Recovered Skimmers:** Using data collected between 2015 and 2018 by the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, we conduct the first long-term study of gas pump skimmers. Our analysis shows that over 90% of annotated reports where skimmers were found had approved security measures in place, indicating the ineffectiveness of these measures.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows:
- Section 2 provides background on the problem of gas pump skimmers.
- Section 3 details the mechanisms of skimmer detection apps.
- Section 4 provides a breakdown of internal skimmers and evaluates the detection apps' ability to detect skimmer characteristics.
- Section 5 discusses the challenges of deploying tamper-evident seals and their practical failures.
- Section 6 offers possible solutions and future work.
- Section 7 discusses related work.
- Section 8 gives concluding remarks.

## 2. Background
Magnetic stripe card data is stored in plaintext, making it easy for any reader to copy and rewrite the data. Attackers use skimming devices to acquire sensitive account data from victims' cards. Skimmers come in various forms and can be installed in different ways, but in the context of gas pumps, they are typically internal. Attackers open the pump, insert the skimmer between the card reader module and the mainboard, and perform a man-in-the-middle attack, reading and storing card data while passing the same data to the pump. From the victim's perspective, the transaction appears normal.

To secure pumps against these attacks, Florida statutes require pump operators to deploy at least one of several security measures, including tamper-evident seals, disabling devices, encrypted card readers, or other approved controls. Despite these measures, gas pump payment fraud results in millions of dollars in losses annually, with individual stores facing an average cost of $700 per year. The high cost of retrofitting newer technologies, such as EMV, makes these solutions financially unviable for many stations.

Some skimmers use wireless data retrieval mechanisms, like Bluetooth, to reduce the risk of detection. This has led to the development of smartphone apps for detecting skimmers. We analyze these apps and their detection mechanisms in detail, evaluating their effectiveness against real-world skimmers.

## 3. Skimmer Detection Apps
Consumers have increasingly turned to skimmer detection apps to protect themselves. Given that some skimmers use Bluetooth, these apps aim to detect rogue Bluetooth signals. We discovered five Android applications and two iOS applications that claim to detect skimmers. We decompiled and analyzed the source code of these apps to determine their detection mechanisms.

### Methodology
We searched for skimming-related terms in the Google Play Market and Apple App Store, identifying five Android and two iOS apps. For Android, we used the JEB decompiler to decompile the Dalvik bytecode and examined the source code. For iOS, we used IDA Pro 7.0 to view the ARM64 assembly, LLDB for debugging, and Frida for function interception. We tested these apps on both jailbroken and stock iOS devices.

### Results
Our analysis revealed the following detection mechanisms for the apps:

- **Skimmer Scanner (A):** This app, based on a SparkFun article, is a C# Xamarin app and open-source. It performs a series of five steps to produce a red alert, the most severe alert. Each step is specific to the skimmer model discussed in the article.
- **ATM Skimmer Detector (B):** This app detects devices named HC-05 or HC-06 with a PIN of 1234 and uses a query/response mechanism.
- **Skim Plus (C):** This app checks if the MAC address matches a known skimmer.
- **Skimmer Protection Scanner (D):** This app does not have a specific detection mechanism.
- **Dark Skimmer Protector (E):** This app also lacks a specific detection mechanism.
- **Skimmer Map (F):** This iOS app relies on crowd-sourced data.
- **Card Skimmer Locator (G):** This iOS app flags devices with names longer than 14 characters.

Table 1 summarizes the detection mechanisms of the analyzed apps. We further tested these apps with real skimmers in Section 4, providing a detailed evaluation of their effectiveness.
