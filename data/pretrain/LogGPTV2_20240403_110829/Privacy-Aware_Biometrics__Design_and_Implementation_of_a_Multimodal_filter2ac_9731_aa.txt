Abstract
A serious concern in the design and use of biometric
authentication systems is the privacy protection of the in-
formation derived from human biometric traits, especially
since such traits cannot be replaced. Combining cryptogra-
phy and biometrics, several recent works proposed to build
the protection in the biometric templates themselves. While
these solutions can increase the conﬁdence in biometric sys-
tems when biometric information is stored for veriﬁcation,
they have been shown difﬁcult to apply to real biometrics. In
this work we present a biometric authentication technique
that exploits multiple biometric traits. It is privacy-aware
as it ensures privacy protection and allows the extraction of
secure identiﬁers by means of cryptographic primitives. We
also discuss the implementation of our approach by con-
sidering, as a signiﬁcant example, the combination of iris
and ﬁngerprint biometrics and present experimental results
obtained from real data. The implementation shows the fea-
sibility of the scheme in practical applications.
1. Introduction
Biometric techniques are more and more deployed in
several commercial, institutional, and forensic applications
to build secure and accurate user authentication procedures.
The interest in biometric approaches for authentication is
increasing for their advantages such as security, accuracy,
reliability, usability, and friendliness. As a matter of fact,
biometric traits (e.g., ﬁngerprints, voice, face), being physi-
cally part of the owner, are always available to the user who
is therefore not afraid of losing them. They are one of the
oldest form of identiﬁcation (e.g., signature on a contract).
However, compared to passwords, biometric traits cannot
be strictly considered as “secrets” since often they can be
inadvertently disclosed: ﬁngerprints are left on a myriad of
objects such as doors’ handles or elevator buttons; pictures
of faces are easily obtained without the cooperation of the
subjects. Moreover, if they are captured or if their digital
representations are stolen, they cannot be simply replaced
or modiﬁed in any way, as it can be done with passwords or
tokens [24]. These aspects have limited so far the number of
applications in which biometric authentication procedures
were allowed by privacy agencies in several countries. In
addition to this, users often perceive the potential threat to
their privacy and this reduces the user acceptance of bio-
metric systems, especially on a large scale.
In a typical biometric authentication system,
trusted
users provide the authentication party with a sample of a
biometric trait (e.g., a ﬁngerprint scan). A digital repre-
sentation of the ﬁngerprint is then stored by the party and
compared at each subsequent authentication with new ﬁn-
gerprint scans. The party is then in charge of protecting
the database where digital representations of ﬁngerprints
are stored. If an intruder gained access to the database, she
could prepare fake ﬁngerprints starting from each of the dig-
ital images. To limit such a possibility, images of biometric
traits are not stored explicitly: only a mathematical descrip-
tion of them is stored (the parameters of a model or relevant
features). Such a mathematical characterization is generally
called template and the information contained in it is sufﬁ-
cient to complete the authentication process. Templates are
obtained through feature extraction algorithms. Often the
database is completely avoided and each user carries with
her a token, digitally signed and encrypted, where her tem-
plate is stored. While such solutions are sensible and cur-
rently deployed, they are still critical from a privacy point
of view since the biometric templates are exposed at risk of
being decrypted and abused if the cryptographic keys are
lost or stolen or the database protection violated.
In the literature, various strategies have been presented
to address the problem of supporting personal veriﬁcation
based on human biometric traits, while ensuring a further

level of protection (privacy) of digital templates [27]. Most
approaches rely on jointly exploiting the characteristics of
biometrics and cryptography [16, 13]. The main idea is that
of devising biometric templates and authentication proce-
dures which do not disclose any information on the orig-
inal biometric traits, for example replicating the usual ap-
proach adopted in password-based authentication system.
There, only a hashed version of the password is stored and
the authentication procedure is carried on only comparing
two hashes, the one stored and the other obtained from the
newly typed password. In this way, the original password
is never recovered (nor it might be) from its hashed ver-
sion. Similarly, biometric templates are generated by using
suited cryptographic primitives so as to protect their privacy
and ensure that an attacker cannot retrieve any information
on the original biometric trait used for the generation of the
template. In this way, users’ privacy is guaranteed. More-
over, even if a template is compromised (stolen, copied,
etc.) it is always possible to generate a novel template by
starting from the same original biometric trait. Biomet-
ric systems which guarantee this further level of protection
might be termed privacy-aware.
The use of cryptographic primitives to protect biometric
templates in privacy-aware systems poses a number of chal-
lenges. Different readings of the same biometric trait of the
same individual, even if obtained by using the same sen-
sor in a short period of time, always show some variability.
For this reason they cannot be directly exploited to secure
the biometric templates by means of standard cryptographic
techniques.
In these techniques, cryptographic keys have
zero uncertainty and a single-bit difference (in the key or
in the encrypted data) spoils the possibility of accessing the
original data. The use of biometrics as cryptographic keys
for protecting the biometrics traits should therefore be er-
ror tolerant, since biometric readings are always different:
generating cryptographic keys from biometrics relies on an
error tolerant binary representation of the biometric features
[14]. A comprehensive survey of different approaches pre-
sented in the literature and the related limits can be found
in [27]. Biohashing and its variants have been presented
in [20] as a solution in which a biometric template is ran-
domized by using a pseudo-random token. However, the
security of such approaches is broken if the pseudo-random
token is stolen or copied. Other variants have been proposed
to face this problem [19].
In this paper, we propose a privacy-aware biometric
cryptographic scheme which, building over previous works,
enables the creation of a unique identiﬁer associated with
each enrolled person by exploiting the error tolerant prop-
erties of the biometric templates. This is obtained by using
multiple biometric traits concurrently and the recently intro-
duced cryptographic primitives secure sketches and fuzzy
extractors. The resulting scheme is multimodal, in the sense
that multiple biometric traits (at least two) can be used.
Other proposals based on secure sketches have been pre-
sented; however, they have been shown difﬁcult to apply
to real biometrics and the construction of practical systems
still is an open issue [26, 4]. In general, we feel that the
main aspect which has not been sufﬁciently studied is the
optimum use of the design opportunities offered by biomet-
ric multimodal systems. The contribution of this work is
threefold. First, we identify the requirements that a privacy-
aware multimodal biometric system should satisfy. Second,
we propose such a privacy-aware system to provide an ef-
fective and easily deployable identity veriﬁcation system.
Third, we suggest a practical implementation of our method
based on real biometrics.
The outline of the work is as follows. Section 2 dis-
cusses approaches presented in the literature.
In Section
3 we sketch the main characteristics that a biometric sys-
tem should present to overcome privacy related issues. In
Section 4, we present the design methodology suited to cre-
ate privacy-aware biometric veriﬁcation systems with the
desired degree of security and privacy protection. The ba-
sic components and the (parallel and hierarchical) compo-
sitions according which they can be arranged are also intro-
duced. In Section 5, we then describe an actual implemen-
tation of the scheme. Given the fact that the construction of
practical systems is critical and many issues indeed relate to
implementation, the section enriches the description of the
scheme. We also report experimental data obtained from
real biometrical datasets. Finally, we give our conclusions
in Section 6.
2. Related work
Several biometric authentication techniques, based on
the use of error correcting codes (ECCs) to cope with the
variability of biometric templates, have been presented in
Juels and Wattenberg [16] proposed the fuzzy
literature.
commitment scheme, where a secret message is protected
by using a biometric template. In this case, an error cor-
recting code is used to associate a codeword c with a person
and compute an offset (δ = c ⊕ x) for the biometric tem-
plate x. The encrypted message (the fuzzy commitment)
is then represented by the pair {δ, h(c)}, where h(c) is a
one-way hash function. Moving in the same direction, Hao
et al. [13] proposed a biometric key generation procedure,
based on an iris code feature extraction algorithm and on
the combined use of Hadamard and Reed-Solomon codes.
Juels and Sudan [15] also proposed a fuzzy vault scheme
relying on the polynomial interpolation technique to cope
with variability of the stored biometric templates. Recently,
a similar approach has been proposed in [25] to achieve a
biometric system for ofﬂine veriﬁcation of certiﬁed, cryp-
tographically secure documents. The presented technique

be practically impossible to recover a representation of
the actual biometric traits. For doing so it can employ
an efﬁcient encryption scheme that converts noisy non-
uniform inputs (like biometric readings are) in easily
and reliably reproducible binary strings with a cer-
tain degree of tolerance in the given inputs. Privacy-
awareness might reduce the perceived threat to privacy
and could overcome the legal issues related to the re-
spect of privacy protection laws, currently ruling in
several countries.
2. Multi-modality. Multiple readings of the same biomet-
ric trait (e.g., the ﬁngerprint of different ﬁngers or the
iris of the two eyes) or multiple different traits should
be considered. Multimodal systems are know to dis-
play a higher reliability [23] and this might increase
user acceptance in a wider spectrum of applications.
Moreover, given a certain level of privacy protection,
the trust in the authentication procedure should scale
with the number of traits (e.g., admission to critical
areas could require a larger number of traits to be ver-
iﬁed).
3. Modularity. The design should be modular with re-
spect to the basic biometric encryption modules. A
larger number of biometric traits should be added by
simply composing the basic modules. Besides simpli-
fying the design process, this allows for a tuning of the
structure of the system to the privacy protection de-
gree requested by the application, thus offering differ-
ent levels of security in authentication at appropriate
costs.
4. Independence. The overall scheme of the system
should be independent from the biometric traits se-
lected and from speciﬁc feature extraction algorithms
implementing proprietary solutions. Besides, as soon
as available, more accurate techniques for biometric
