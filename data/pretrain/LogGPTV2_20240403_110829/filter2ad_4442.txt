## Abstract
Most studies rely on traceroute-collected path traces to construct Internet maps. This paper examines the impact of alias resolution on Internet topology measurement studies. Our analysis reveals that the alias resolution process significantly affects the observed characteristics of the resulting topology maps.

## 1. Introduction
Internet measurement studies require accurate and representative network maps. Many such studies use the traceroute tool to collect router-level topologies from the Internet. After collecting path traces, the data must be processed to build the network topology. A critical step in this process is IP alias resolution, which involves identifying multiple IP addresses belonging to the same router. Since routers often have multiple interfaces with different IP addresses, a single router may appear on multiple paths with different IP addresses. The goal of IP alias resolution is to consolidate these IP addresses into a single node in the topology map.

Several tools have been developed for IP alias resolution in traceroute-based topology construction [1, 2, 3, 4]. The current best practice is to use these tools to resolve IP aliases. However, there is no practical method to measure the success rate of the alias resolution process, as it is extremely difficult to obtain the underlying topology information for verification. The lack of this information is the primary reason researchers conduct topology collection studies.

A key issue is understanding the impact of the alias resolution process on the observed topological characteristics of the collected topology maps. If the impact is minimal, we can have confidence in the conclusions of the measurement study even without an alias resolution process. Conversely, if the impact is significant, the study's conclusions may heavily depend on the accuracy of the alias resolution process. While recent studies have highlighted the impact of inaccurate alias resolution, to our knowledge, there is no systematic study quantifying this impact on traceroute-based Internet measurement studies.

## 2. Experimental Setup
In this paper, we present an experimental study to quantify the impact of alias resolution on Internet topology measurement studies. We generate synthetic network graphs using Barabasi-Albert (BA), Waxman (WA), and Transit-Stub (TS) models. We then emulate traceroute functionality by collecting path traces from these graphs. During the sample topology construction, we apply different success rates for the alias resolution process to create various sample topologies. Here, 0% indicates complete failure of alias resolution, and 100% indicates perfect success.

We analyze over 20 different graph characteristics, including topology size, node degree, degree distribution, joint degree distribution, characteristic path length, betweenness, and clustering-related characteristics. Due to space constraints, we present a subset of the results to summarize our findings.

## 3. Results and Discussion
Our main conclusion is that the accuracy of the alias resolution process significantly impacts almost all topological characteristics considered in this study. Therefore, Internet measurement studies should employ all available methods to increase the accuracy and completeness of the alias resolution process. Even with these efforts, our confidence in the results will be limited by the lack of a mechanism to verify the accuracy and completeness of the alias resolution process.

### 3.1. Impact on Degree Characteristics
We examine the changes in node degrees with improving alias resolution. Our experiments show that the accuracy of the alias resolution process has a significant impact on node degree-related characteristics. Although one might expect better accuracy with higher alias resolution success rates, this trend is not always observed.

Figure 1 illustrates an example where the 'no-alias resolution' case (Fig. 1-b) provides a better approximation of the degree of node a and the average and maximum degrees of the original subgraph (Fig. 1-a) compared to the 'partial alias resolution' case (Fig. 1-c).

Figure 2 shows the changes in node degrees for a (100,100)-sample topology of the BA graph under 0%, 40%, and 80% alias resolution success rates. Points above the x=y line indicate overestimation of node degrees, while points below the line indicate underestimation. Overestimation is generally caused by alias resolution problems at neighboring nodes, while underestimation is due to issues at the node itself. The observed maximum degree of the graph first increases from 44 to 99 and then decreases to 60 as the alias resolution success rate improves.

### 3.2. Impact on Graph Characteristics
#### 3.2.1. Topology Size
The success of alias resolution significantly affects the topology size. As alias resolution improves from 0% to 100%, the number of nodes and edges in the sample topologies reduces by 57% and 62%, respectively, on average. The impact of imperfect alias resolution increases with the size of the sample topology.

#### 3.2.2. Degree Distribution
Degree distribution is a common metric used to characterize network topologies. In our experiments, we observe that the degree distribution changes with the alias resolution success rate, but the effects vary across different samples. For power-law based graphs (e.g., BA-based samples), imperfect alias resolution distorts the power-law characteristic of the distributions. For TS- and WA-based samples, the alias resolution process has different impacts, particularly at low and high degree ranges, respectively.

#### 3.2.3. Characteristic Path Length
Characteristic path length (CPL) measures the average of the shortest path lengths between all node pairs in a network. In all sample topologies, CPL values decrease with increasing alias resolution success rates. The average reduction for BA and WA-based sample topologies is about 30%. For TS-based samples, we observe minimal changes, possibly due to the hierarchical nature of the TS graph, which makes the shortest path lengths less affected by alias resolution.

#### 3.2.4. Betweenness
Betweenness is a measure of centrality, reporting the total number of shortest paths passing through a node. We analyze betweenness distribution and observe considerable changes with increasing alias resolution success rates. The average betweenness decreases with improved alias resolution, while the normalized betweenness increases.

#### 3.2.5. Clustering
Clustering characterizes the density of connections in the neighborhood of a node. We analyze clustering distribution with respect to node degree and observe an increase with increasing alias resolution success rates. The clustering coefficient, a summary metric, is the ratio of the number of triangles to the number of triplets. In our experiments, all samples yield a clustering coefficient of 0 with 0% alias resolution success rate, and this value increases with higher alias resolution success rates, except for one case.

## 4. Conclusion
The accuracy of the alias resolution process has a significant impact on the topological characteristics of the collected topology maps. Internet measurement studies should employ all available methods to improve the accuracy and completeness of the alias resolution process. Despite these efforts, the confidence in the results will be limited by the lack of a mechanism to verify the accuracy and completeness of the alias resolution process.
