Abstract. Most
studies utilize traceroute-
collected path traces to build Internet maps. In this paper, we measure
the impact of alias resolution problem on Internet topology measure-
ment studies. Our analysis shows that the alias resolution process has a
signiﬁcant eﬀect on the observed characteristics of the topology maps.
1 Introduction
Internet measurement studies require the availability of representative Internet
maps. Most measurement studies utilize a well-known Internet debugging tool
called traceroute to collect a router-level topology map from the Internet. Af-
ter collecting the path traces, the information needs to be processed to build
the corresponding network topology. This step requires identiﬁcation of the IP
addresses belonging to the same router, a task often referred to as IP alias res-
olution. Since routers have multiple interfaces with diﬀerent IP addresses, it is
likely that a router may appear on multiple paths with diﬀerent interface IP
addresses. The goal of IP alias resolution is to combine the IP addresses that
belong to the same router into a single node in the resulting topology map.
Several tools have been proposed to resolve IP aliases in traceroute-based
topology construction studies. [1,2,3,4]. The current best practice is to use the
existing tools to resolve IP aliases to build a topology map. However, there is no
practical way to measure the success rate of the alias resolution process. That
is, it is extremely diﬃcult to collect the underlying topology information for
veriﬁcation purposes. In fact, the lack of the underlying topology information is
the main reason that leads the researchers to conduct topology collection studies.
At this point, one issue is to understand the impact of the alias resolution pro-
cess on the observed topological characteristics of the collected topology maps. If
the impact is acceptably small, then we could have conﬁdence on the conclusions
of the measurement study even without an alias resolution process. On the other
hand, if the impact is high, the conclusions of the study may signiﬁcantly depend
on the accuracy of the alias resolution process. Although several recent studies
pointed out the impact of inaccurate alias resolution in certain measurement
study results, to the best of our knowledge, there is no systematic study that
quantiﬁes the impact of inaccurate alias resolution on traceroute-based Internet
measurement studies.

Impact of Alias Resolution on Traceroute-Based Sample Network Topologies

In this paper, we present an experimental study to quantify the impact of
alias resolution on Internet topology measurement studies. First we generate
several synthetic network graphs using Barabasi-Albert (BA), Waxman (WA)
and Transit-Stub (TS) network models. Then, we emulate traceroute function-
ality by collecting a number of path traces from the network graphs. During the
sample topology construction, we use diﬀerent success rates for the alias resolu-
tion process to obtain diﬀerent sample topologies. Here, 0% indicates that alias
resolution fails for all nodes in the network and 100% indicates that it succeeds
for all nodes. We then study various topological characteristics of these sample
topologies to quantify the impact of alias resolution on the observed results.
We consider over 20 diﬀerent graph characteristics including topology size, node
degree, degree distribution, joint degree distribution, characteristic path length,
betweenness, and clustering related characteristics. Due to size limitations, we
present only a subset of the results to summarize our ﬁndings.
Our main conclusion in this study is that the accuracy of the alias resolution
process has a signiﬁcant impact on almost all topological characteristics that
we consider in this study. Therefore, Internet measurement studies should em-
ploy all the means possible to increase the accuracy/completeness of the alias
resolution process. Even in this cases, our conﬁdence in the results of such mea-
surement studies will be limited by the lack of a mechanism to verify the accu-
racy/completeness of the alias resolution process.
2 Impact of Alias Resolution on Degree Characteristics
In this section, we study changes in node degrees with improving alias resolution.
In our experiments we observe that the accuracy of the alias resolution process
has an important impact on the node degree-related characteristics of the sample
topologies. Although one may intuitively expect an improvement on the accuracy
of the degree-related characteristics with an increasing success rate of the alias
resolution process, we may not necessarily observe such a trend all the time.
Fig. 1 presents an example scenario where ‘no-alias resolution’ case (Fig. 1-b)
results in a better approximation to (1) the degree of node a and (2) the average
and the maximum degrees of the original subgraph (Fig. 1-a) compared to the
‘partial alias resolution’ case (Fig. 1-c) when we resolve aliases only for a.
We study sample topologies to observe the changes in node degrees as the
success of the alias resolution process increases. This helps us gain more insight
into the impact of the alias resolution process on the node degree characteristics.

Fig. 2. Degree comparison for (100,100)-sample topologies from Barabasi-Albert
Fig. 2-a,-b,-c show the changes in node degrees for (100,100)-sample topology of
BA graph for 0%, 40%, and 80% alias resolution success rates. In these ﬁgures,
‘Observed Degree’ indicates the degrees of the nodes in the sample topology
with imperfect alias resolution and ‘True Degree’ indicates the degrees in the
sample topology with perfect alias resolution. Each point in these ﬁgures may
correspond to one or more nodes in the sample topology with the same ‘Observed’
and the same ‘True’ degrees. The number of nodes corresponding to each point
is presented in the frequency distribution graph in Fig. 2-d. As an example, the
‘+’ tick at location (99,1) in Fig. 2-d indicates that there exists only one node
with an ‘Observed Degree’ of 99 under 40% alias resolution success rate and this
node is presented in Fig. 2-b with the point marked at (44,99) label at the top
of the ﬁgure. The label indicates that the ’Real Degree’ of this node is 44.
We now present several observations about the results presented in these
ﬁgures. The points above the x=y line in Fig. 2-a,-b,-c correspond to overesti-
mation of node degrees and the points below the x=y line correspond to under-
estimations of node degrees in the sample topologies. In general, overestimation
is caused by alias resolution problems at the neighboring nodes of a given node.
Fig. 1-c presents an example for this case. Similarly, underestimation is caused
by alias resolution problems at the node itself. In addition, the comparison of
Fig. 2-a,-b,-c show that the observed maximum degree of the graph ﬁrst increases
from 44 in Fig. 2-a to 99 in Fig. 2-b. It then goes down to 60 in Fig. 2-c (and
down to 50 with 100% alias resolution success rate). Another observation from

the ﬁgure is that alias resolution problems at a node may introduce a signiﬁ-
cantly large number of artiﬁcial nodes in the resulting sample topologies. As an
example, according to Fig. 2-d, there is only one node with a true degree of 50
in the real sample graph (i.e., refer to (50,1) point in Fig. 2-d). On the other
hand, Fig. 2-a,-b,-c show a large number of nodes with observed degrees less
than 50 that correspond to a node with a degree of 50. Finally, we observe that
as the alias resolution success rate increases some of the underestimation cases
change to overestimation (compare Fig. 2-a vs. Fig. 2-b for x=43 and x=44 and
Fig. 2-b vs. Fig. 2-c for x=35, x=37, and x=39). This indicates that although the
alias resolution problems of the corresponding nodes are ﬁxed, there exists some
neighbors of these nodes with alias resolution problems causing overestimation.
3 Impact of Alias Resolution on Graph Characteristics
In this section we summarize the impact of poor alias resolution on topologies.
Topology Size: According to the experiment results, the success of alias reso-
lution has a big impact on the topology size. Number of nodes and edges reduces
57% and 62%, respectively, on average for sample topologies as alias resolution
improves from 0% to 100%. Besides, the impact of imperfect alias resolution
increases as the size of the sample topology increases.
Degree Distribution: Degree distribution has been used to characterize net-
work topologies and several topology generators use this characteristic to gener-
ate synthetic topologies. In our experiments, we observe that degree distribution
changes with the changing success rate of the alias resolution process, but diﬀer-
ent eﬀects are observed with diﬀerent samples. For the power-law based graph
samples, i.e., BA-based samples, imperfect alias resolution distorts the power-
law characteristic of the distributions. For TS- and WA-based samples, the alias
resolution process has diﬀerent types of impacts especially at low degree or high
degree ranges, respectively.
Characteristic Path Length: Characteristic path length (CPL) measures the
average of the shortest path lengths between all node pairs in a network. In all
of the sample topologies, CPL values reduce with the increasing alias resolution
success rate. The average reduction for BA, and WA-based sample topologies
is about 30%. For TS-based samples, we do not observe much changes. This
is possibly due to the fact that the TS graph is a hierarchical graph and the
shortest path lengths are not aﬀected by the alias resolution process.
Betweenness: Betweenness is a mesure of centrality. It reports the total number
of shortest paths that pass through node v. Usually betweenness is normalized
with the maximum possible value, i.e, n(n − 1) where n is the number of nodes.
We analyze betweenness distribution and observe considerable changes with the
increasing alias resolution success rate. The average betweenness reduces with an
improvement in alias resolution success rate. On the other hand, the normalized
betweenness increases as the alias resolution success rate increases.

Clustering: Clustering characterizes the density of the connections in the
neighborhood of a node. We analyze clustering distribution with respect to node
degree and observe an increase with increasing alias resolution success rate. Clus-
tering coeﬃcient, a summary metric of clustering, is the ratio of the number of
triangles to the number of triplets. In experiments, all samples yield a clustering
coeﬃcient of 0 with 0% alias resolution success rate and always increases with
the increasing alias resolution success rate except for a single case.
