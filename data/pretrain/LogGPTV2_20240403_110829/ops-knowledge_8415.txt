14. **June 10, 1973, 20:28:54** - A `node` is configured out (note the unusual year).
15. **August 12, 2004, 14:32:06** - A `node` is running.
16. **August 12, 2004, 14:23:22** - A `node` is running.

### Summary:
- **May 30, 2004**: The `tserver` is not responding.
- **May 31, 2004**: A `node` is running.
- **June 17, 2004**: A `partition` is running, and a `node` is active.
- **June 23, 2004**: Multiple entries show a `node` is running.
- **July 14, 2004**: A `node` is running.
- **July 15, 2004**: A `node` is not responding and configured out.
- **July 31, 2004**: A `node` is running and another is configured out.
- **June 10, 1973**: An unusual entry shows a `node` is configured out.
- **August 12, 2004**: Two `nodes` are running.

### Observations:
- The `tserver` had an issue on May 30, 2004.
- There are multiple instances where a `node` is running, but there are also periods when it is not responding or configured out.
- The entry from June 10, 1973, is an anomaly and may be a data entry error.
- The log entries for June 23, 2004, at 20:48:54, 20:48:53, and 20:48:56, are redundant and suggest a possible logging loop or repeated event.
