**Ways, Manner, and Means of the Conspiracy**

In furtherance of the Conspiracy, defendants and others known and unknown to the Grand Jury employed, among others, the following manner and means:

53. It was part of the Conspiracy that the defendants and their co-conspirators operated a number of Internet sites and associated services, including Megaupload.com, Megavideo.com, and Megaclick.com.

54. It was further part of the Conspiracy that members of the Conspiracy had the ability to search files on the computer systems they controlled. The records kept by the Conspiracy included, but were not limited to, the identity of the user who uploaded the content, the date it was uploaded, the MD5 hash value for the file, the Mega Conspiracy-created links that pointed to the content, the size of the file, the name the user provided for the file, the apparent number of times the file had been downloaded (until August 31, 2010), and whether a copyright infringement notice had been received for any link associated with the content file.

55. It was further part of the Conspiracy that the content available on Megaupload.com and Megavideo.com was provided by known and unknown members of the Mega Conspiracy, including several of the defendants, who uploaded infringing copies of copyrighted works onto computer servers leased by the Mega Conspiracy in North America to further the reproduction and distribution of copyrighted works. Specifically, copyright-infringing content was reproduced and distributed using various servers in Toronto, Canada; Los Angeles, California; and Ashburn, Virginia (the latter of which is in the Eastern District of Virginia).

56. It was further part of the Conspiracy that content was also reproduced on and distributed from computer servers leased or owned by the Mega Conspiracy in France and the Netherlands.

57. It was further part of the Conspiracy that the Conspiracy made no significant effort to identify and block users who were using the Mega Sites or services to infringe copyrights, to prevent the uploading of infringing copies of copyrighted materials, or to identify infringing copies of copyrighted works located on computer servers controlled by the Conspiracy.

58. It was further part of the Conspiracy, from at least September 2005 until July 2011, that the Conspiracy provided financial incentives for users to upload infringing copies of popular copyrighted works. The Conspiracy made payments to uploaders who were known to have uploaded infringing copies of copyrighted works, as well as repeat infringers.

59. It was further part of the Conspiracy that it designed its computer systems to automatically reproduce additional copies of some works that had originally been uploaded by individual users and distributed these additional copies to multiple computer servers under the control of the Conspiracy around the world, including to computer servers that were specifically designed to rapidly mass-distribute files.

60. It was further part of the Conspiracy that members of the Conspiracy monitored the public actions of law enforcement regarding large-scale copyright infringement and took active steps to conceal the copyright-infringing activities taking place on the Mega Sites.

61. It was further part of the Conspiracy that the members of the Conspiracy misrepresented to the Conspiracy's users and the public the nature of the files that were contained on the computer servers it controlled and the amount of their network bandwidth associated with known or obvious infringement.

62. It was further part of the Conspiracy that members of the Conspiracy purposefully did not provide full and accurate search results to the public, or, in the case of Megaupload.com, chose not to provide any search functionality at all in order to conceal the fact that the primary purpose of the website and service was to reproduce and distribute infringing copies of copyrighted works for commercial advantage and private financial gain.

63. It was further part of the Conspiracy that members of the Conspiracy reproduced copyrighted works directly from third-party websites, including YouTube.com, to make them available for reproduction and distribution on Megavideo.com, creating the false impression that Megavideo.com hosted primarily user-generated content instead of copyright-infringing content.

64. It was further part of the Conspiracy that members of the Conspiracy generally did not terminate the user accounts of known copyright-infringing users, even though they had the right and ability under their Terms of Service to do so.

65. It was further part of the Conspiracy that members of the Conspiracy generally did not delete infringing copies of copyrighted works from computer servers that they controlled, even when they were aware of the infringing material or when the removal of that content was specifically requested by the copyright holder.

66. It was further part of the Conspiracy that members of the Conspiracy responded on a selective basis to requests to remove infringing content (or access thereto) from the computer servers they controlled, and sometimes deliberately did not remove copyrighted works (or even links thereto) when it would result in a loss of revenue.

67. It was further part of the Conspiracy that members of the Conspiracy told copyright holders and their representatives that they would remove infringing content identified by the holders and their representatives from the servers the Conspiracy controlled, when, in fact, they only removed certain links to the content file (which could still be illegally downloaded through numerous redundant links). Redundant links were sometimes even created by members of the Conspiracy.

68. It was further part of the Conspiracy that members of the Conspiracy told complaining rights holders and their representatives that they had deleted or blocked the user accounts of known and repeat copyright-infringing users, when, in fact, they had not.

69. It was further part of the Conspiracy that the computer systems operated by members of the Conspiracy allowed the uploading of many hundreds of thousands of infringing copies of copyrighted files from anonymous users, and the Conspiracy financially profited from the distribution of these files.

70. It was further part of the Conspiracy that the computer systems operated by members of the Conspiracy have been used to distribute many hundreds of thousands of infringing copies of copyrighted works to anonymous users, and the Conspiracy has financially profited from those distributions.

71. It was further part of the Conspiracy that infringing copies of many thousands of copyrighted works on Megaupload.com and Megavideo.com were made available to tens of millions of visitors each day.

72. It was further part of the Conspiracy that the Conspiracy derived a direct financial benefit from infringement through the advertising placed on the Mega Sites and from "premium" subscription charges. Between September 2005 and January 5, 2012, the defendants collectively received more than $175 million from advertising and subscriptions.

**Overt Acts**

73. It was further part of the Conspiracy that the following acts in furtherance of and to effect the objects of the above-described Conspiracy were committed in the Eastern District of Virginia and elsewhere:

a. From at least November 24, 2006, until at least January 19, 2012, infringing copies of copyrighted materials were stored on computer servers located at Carpathia Hosting in Ashburn, Virginia, which is in the Eastern District of Virginia.

b. For the 180 days up to and including January 19, 2012, members of the Conspiracy infringed copyrights, in the Eastern District of Virginia and elsewhere, by reproducing and distributing by electronic means at least ten copies and phonorecords of one or more copyrighted works.
