##### Detailed description
I just updated OpenCV 4.2.0 and found a big problem.  
If I open the lenna BMP image with IMREAD_GRAYSCALE flag, the image is little
bit dark. (the mean value was 110)  
I felt something weird because I knew the mean value of lenna gray image is
124.  
So I tried to open the lenna image as a color image and convert it to a
grayscale image using cvtColor(), then the mean value was 124.  
So there must be something wrong on the color conversion code in imread().
##### Steps to reproduce
Mat src1 = imread("lenna.bmp", IMREAD_GRAYSCALE);  
Mat src2 = imread("lenna.bmp", IMREAD_COLOR);  
cvtColor(src2, src2, COLOR_BGR2GRAY);
cout << mean(src1)[0] << endl; // 110.207  
cout << mean(src2)[0] << endl; // 124.049
##### My opinion
I checked the recent versions, and found that OpenCV 4.1.0 was ok.  
So I searched commits and found it:  
`058367f`#diff-c868f69925dd124c54190546d4843841
In the updated code, I think 68th line should be changed like this:
(-) if (_swap_rb) std::swap(cRGB0, cRGB2);  
(+) if (!_swap_rb) std::swap(cRGB0, cRGB2);
Please check the code.
