User: How to use Wireshark to analyze network traffic, identify and locate abnormal traffic?
Assistant: The following are the steps for standard Wireshark to analyze network traffic: 1. Capture network traffic: Use Wireshark to start a packet capture on the target system. Data packets can be filtered as required to reduce interference during packet capture. Wireshark can capture packets of different protocols such as TCP, UDP and HTTP. 2. Analyze the packet header: Wireshark can analyze the captured data packets to display the packet header information, such as source MAC address, destination MAC address, source IP address, destination IP address, etc. When analyzing packet headers, you can see if there is any unusual traffic. 3. Display the TCP flow: In Wireshark, the TCP flow is represented by a sequence number and an acknowledgment number. Very important for identifying abnormal traffic. 4. Analyze the data segment: Wireshark also supports the analysis of the data segment. If the data segment is in hex, you can use Wireshark's "Anatomy" tab to view the hex content. You can see if there are unusual data types. 5. Filter traffic: Wireshark can use filters to filter network traffic. The filter can filter the following content: IP address, port number, protocol type, traffic size, etc., in order to find abnormal traffic. 6. Traffic details: Wireshark provides a lot of statistics to better understand the captured traffic. These statistics include: packet count, traffic size, average packet sending rate, latency and more. When identifying traffic anomalies, you should also pay attention to the following: 1. Frequency If there is traffic that has not been seen before, it may be a sign of abnormal traffic. Focusing on frequency of occurrence can help to properly detect and locate abnormal traffic. 2. Size If the amount of data is significantly larger than normal, the traffic may be cause for concern. In Wireshark, filters can be used to find large packets. 3. Source and destination addresses that appear different than expected IP addresses, then this could be a sign of unusual traffic from a non-authenticated source. Orientation and relative position are also important. 4. Protocol types Some protocols (such as FTP or DNS) may cause vulnerabilities and attacks, so the traffic of the relevant protocols should be analyzed in more detail. When Wireshark detects abnormal traffic, you can use the following steps to locate it: 1. Determine the attack path Use Wireshark's "Trace Flow" function to trace the attack or abnormal traffic path. 2. Find malicious code or intrusion Wireshark can provide programs or files that may cause abnormal traffic. 3. Check the source address Checking the source address of abnormal traffic can help identify unauthorized access or network intrusion of unknown machines. 4. Confirm the vulnerability Wireshark can display the attack traffic and help identify the location of the C code running the vulnerability. By using various functions and tricks of Wireshark, anomalous and harmful behavior in network traffic can be detected and provide a lot of useful information to determine the source, destination and type.
