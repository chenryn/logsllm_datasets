User: So I'm trying to install virtualenvwrapper and then as a requirement for the task I'm trying to implement I'm supposed to update my .bash_profile file to contain the lines

source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh

But after activating the changes to the file I get 

-bash: /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh: No such file or directory

So that's because using pip install virtualenv the package gets installed in ./Library/Python/2.7/lib/python/site-packages .
My question is, is it okay to manually relocate the packages? What would be the way to do so?
Assistant: Just change the path in your source command to match the location of the script, which should be where pip installed it, that is in /usr/local/bin if you used sudo pip install to install it system wide, or wherever the bin directory associated with your python environment is located. That would /path/to/virtualenv/local/bin if you are using a virtualenv, or /path/to/anaconda/bin if you are using anaconda's python distribution.
