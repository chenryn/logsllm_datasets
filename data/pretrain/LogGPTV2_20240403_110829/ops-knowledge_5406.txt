User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Is storing a JWT secret as docker env variable acceptable? I understand how JWTs work and that with my secret anyone can issue new tokens. I control the server that my node website runs on and am considering different options for hosting the key.


In code - Not acceptable because my code is in a github repo
ENV variable - seperate secrets for dev and production while not leaking to github
Store in database - Seems more like 2nd option with more work, being that an on-machine attacker can find access to the db anyways


2nd option looks like the best method for a simple website (no super sensitive user info like credit cards or SSNs). 

Is this a good solution?

Assistant: Use environment variables as you said, just be careful in how you actually pass the value to the variable so that it doesn't leak to logs.

For example, instead of docker run -e SECRET=foo, use docker run -e SECRET=$(cat my_secret).
