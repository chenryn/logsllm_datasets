MULTI-STAGE ANOMALY SCORING AND AGGREGATION
We use Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) to de-
sign a multi-stage decision-making process and identify the
most
interesting cases by ranking IP blocks according to
their (anomalous) routing behavior. A typical MCDA problem
consists to evaluate a set of alternatives w.r.t. different criteria
using an aggregation function [17]. The outcome of this
evaluation is a global score obtained with a well-deﬁned aggre-
gation model that incorporates a set of constraints reﬂecting
the preferences and expectations of the decision-maker. An
aggregation function is deﬁned as a monotonically increasing
function of n arguments (n > 1): faggr : [0, 1]n −→ [0, 1].
OWA extends averaging functions by combining two char-
acteristics: (i) a weighting vector (like in a classical weighted
mean), and (ii) sorting the inputs (usually in descending order),
hence the name of Ordered Weighted Averaging [48]. OWA is
deﬁned as:
OW Aw(x) =
wix(i) =
n(cid:88)
i=1
where x(cid:38) is used to represent
the vector x arranged in
decreasing order: x(1) ≥ x(2) ≥ . . . ≥ x(n). This allows
a decision-maker to design more complex decision modeling
schemes, in which we can ensure that only a portion of criteria
is satisﬁed without any preference on which exactly (e.g.
“at least” k criteria satisﬁed out of n). OWA differs from a
classical weighted means in that the weights are not associated
with particular inputs, but rather with their magnitude, and it
can thus emphasize the largest, smallest or mid-range values.
It might be useful also to take into account the reliability
of each information source in the aggregation model, like in
Weighted Mean (WM). Torra proposed thus a generalization of
OWA, called Weighted OWA (WOWA) [45]. This aggregation
function quantiﬁes the reliability of the information sources
with a vector p (as the weighted mean does), and at the
same time, by weighting the values in relation to their relative
ordering with a second vector w (as the OWA operator).
Weighted OWA is deﬁned by:
where x(i) is the ith largest component of x and the weights
ui are deﬁned as
n(cid:88)
 (cid:88)
 − G
function that interpolates the points (i/n,(cid:80)
G(i/n) =(cid:80)
G is linear if the points (i/n,(cid:80)
where the set Hi = {j|xj ≥ xi} is the set of indices of the
i largest elements of x, and G is a monotone non-decreasing
j≤i wj) together
with the point (0, 0). Moreover, G is required to have the two
following properties:
(cid:88)
j∈Hi
j≤i wj, i = 0, . . . , n;
