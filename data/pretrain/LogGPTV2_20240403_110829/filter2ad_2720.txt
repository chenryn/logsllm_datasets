ABSTRACT
The publish/subscribe model oﬀers a loosely-coupled com-
munication paradigm where applications interact indirectly
and asynchronously. Publisher applications generate events
that are forwarded to subscriber applications by a network
of brokers. Subscribers register by specifying ﬁlters that
brokers match against events as part of the routing process.
Brokers might be deployed on untrusted servers where mali-
cious entities can get access to events and ﬁlters. Supporting
conﬁdentiality of events and ﬁlters in this setting is still an
open challenge. First of all, it is desirable that publishers
and subscribers do not share secret keys, such a require-
ment being against the loose-coupling of the model. Second,
brokers need to route events by matching encrypted events
against encrypted ﬁlters. This should be possible even with
very complex ﬁlters. Existing solutions do not fully address
these issues. This work describes the implementation of a
novel schema that supports (i) conﬁdentiality for events and
ﬁlters; (ii) ﬁlters that express very complex constraints on
events even if brokers are not able to access any informa-
tion on both events and ﬁlters; (iii) and ﬁnally, does not
require publishers and subscribers to share keys. We then
describe an e-Health application scenario for monitoring pa-
tients with chronic diseases and show how our encryption
schema can be used to provide conﬁdentiality of the patients’
personal and medical data, and control who can receive the
patients’ data and under which conditions.

1. MOTIVATION
The publish/subscribe (pub/sub) model is an asynchronous
communication paradigm where senders, known as publish-
ers, and receivers, known as subscribers, exchange messages
in a loosely coupled manner, i.e. without establishing direct
contact. The messages that publishers generate are called
events. Publishers do not send events directly to subscribers,
instead a network of interconnected brokers is responsible for
event delivery. In fact, publishers do not know who receives
their events and subscribers are not aware of the source of
information. In order to receive events, subscribers need to
register their interest with a broker through a ﬁlter. When a
new event is published, brokers forward it to all subscribers
which expressed a ﬁlter that matches the event.
Pub/sub is an open communication model with the im-
plicit assumption that the interconnected brokers are trusted
with events and ﬁlters conﬁdentiality. However, it is very
likely that brokers could be deployed on an outsourced in-
frastructure. In this context, a malicious administrator of
the infrastructure could gain access to the events that are
routed through the broker. Moreover, accessing the content
of the ﬁlters registered in the broker can provide useful in-
formation to the attacker. For example, a subscriber may
register a ﬁlter for receiving events when the price of the
quotes of a certain company is below a certain threshold.
This information could reveal the subscriber’s strategy to a
competitor, thus the subscriber will wish to keep it conﬁ-
dential.
Providing event and ﬁlter conﬁdentiality in the presence
of potentially compromised brokers is still a main challenge
for pub/sub systems. On the one hand, any solution that
aims at protecting the conﬁdentiality of the model should
not hamper the loosely coupling property of the model. So-
lutions such as the one described in [6] require publishers
and subscribers to share a group key. Such solutions are
impractical since publishers and subscribers should be ag-
nostic of each others. On the other hand, protecting the
conﬁdentiality of ﬁlters from malicious brokers is very dif-
ﬁcult. Brokers need to access the ﬁlters to route events.
Encryption schemas for event and ﬁlter conﬁdentiality have
been proposed (such as in [7]) that restrict the matching ca-
pability of the brokers. These solutions allow subscribers to
deﬁne ﬁlters with equality on one keyword. Other solutions,
such as [5] and [6], do not support ﬁlter conﬁdentiality and
do not allow the deﬁnition of complex encrypted ﬁlters. In
these solutions only certain ﬁelds of the events are encrypted
696while other ﬁelds are left as cleartext so that they can be
used for routing.
In this poster, we present an encryption scheme for the
conﬁdentiality in pub/sub systems such that: (i) it provides
conﬁdentiality of events and ﬁlters, (ii) it does not require
publishers and subscribers to share keys, and (iii) it allows
subscribers to express ﬁlters that can deﬁne any monotonic
and non-monotonic conditions. We have implemented our
encryption scheme and it will be available for demonstration
to the viewers during the poster session.
2. SOLUTION DETAILS
In this section, we provide a high-level description of our
solution. For the full details, we remand the interested
reader to the following paper [4].
In our approach an event E consists of: (i) the message
M that represents the content of the event and (ii) a set of
attributes {ai} that characterise M and are used for event
ﬁltering by the brokers.
To support conﬁdentiality of events and allow publishers
to control who can read their messages, the message M is
encrypted using CP-ABE [1]. CP-ABE allows a publisher to
specify which attributes a decrypter must have. For exam-
ple, a publisher could specify that only people belonging to
a particular organisation or who have a speciﬁc role should
read the message. In using CP-ABE to encrypt M , publish-
ers and subscribers do not need to share any secret key.
Filter conﬁdentiality is achieved by combining KP-ABE
[3] with multi-user searchable data encryption (SDE) scheme
[2]. In particular, a subscriber Sj can deﬁne a ﬁlter Fj as
a KP-ABE access trees. The set of attributes {ai} that the
publisher deﬁned on an event E is used by the brokers to
evaluate the ﬁlters. When the event E reaches a broker, if
the set of attributes associated with the event satisfy the
ﬁlter Fj, then the broker knows that the event can be for-
warded to Sj. However, if the KP-ABE scheme is used as
proposed in [3], then the broker is still able to obtain infor-
mation on the ﬁlters and attributes associated with events,
thus violating the conﬁdentiality of events and ﬁlters.
In
fact, the KP-ABE scheme requires that the attributes as-
sociated with the ciphertext are not encrypted. To circum-
vent this limitation, we propose the following modiﬁcation
to the KP-ABE scheme: the set of attributes associated
with an event and the access tree representing the ﬁlter are
encrypted using the scheme from [2]. The scheme supports
encrypted search, so it can be used to verify if the encrypted
attributes speciﬁed by the publisher are the same as those
speciﬁed by the subscriber in the ﬁlter. With this modiﬁca-
tion, our scheme supports conﬁdentiality of ﬁlters and allows
the brokers to perform encrypted event ﬁltering. It should
be noted that both KP-ABE and the multi-user SDE do
not require that publishers and subscribers share keys thus
simplifying key management.
3. APPLICATION SCENARIO
In the following, we describe an e-Health application in
which an outsourced pub/sub system is responsible for mes-
sage delivery to the involved stakeholders. The exchanged
messages contain personal and medical information of pa-
tients, and hence, we need to ensure their conﬁdentiality in
the presence of untrusted third parties.

motely monitoring patients with a chronic disease that do
not require hospitalisation, such as heart diseases or dia-
betes.
In order to provide adequate medical care to pa-
tients, several institutions need to cooperate and exchange
sensitive medical data. Doctors need to continuously mon-
itor both speciﬁc physiological parameters of their patients
such as blood pressure, blood oxygen levels, weight etc. and
their habits such as diet and physical activity. This in-
formation is collected by an in-Home Monitoring System
(iHMS) through the use of electronic devices self-managed
by the patient. These devices have wireless means to con-
nect to a central gateway where the data is collected. When-
ever meaningful data becomes available, the gateway pub-
lishes it as a new event and the pub/sub system delivers it
to all parties such as the patient’s doctor or nurse which
registered interest through a ﬁlter. For example, a ﬁlter
could express the following conditions: name=“John Smith”
AND (heart rate>120 OR systolic pressure>150 OR dias-
tolic pressure>100).
Doctors can prescribe medicines that are directly provided
by the hospital and reimbursed by the Healthcare Authority
(HA). In order to assure the appropriateness of the therapy
and the exact amount of costs to be reimbursed, the hospi-
tal has to provide to the HA data related to the patient’s
conditions and drug costs. The Drug Stock Management
(DSM) provides drugs to the patients based on the thera-
peutic data provided by the doctors. The drugs can be de-
livered at home thanks to a Drug Delivery Service (DDS).
Finally, there is a Research Centre that performs data pro-
cessing of the received information from various hospitals
and healthcare authorities.
The pub/sub system responsible for delivering messages
between these parties is outsourced to an IT company that
provides and maintains the servers where the message bus
is deployed. A malicious employee of the IT company can
easily get access to published events and registered ﬁlters
and learn information about the patients medical condition
and drug information, thus violating the patients’ privacy.
However, by implementing our encryption solution in the
pub/sub system, we can ensure that only authorised par-
ties are able to decrypt the events. Publishers will encrypt
697the medical data using CP-ABE and specify the attributes
the decrypter must have such as “Doctor” OR (“nurse” AND
“level>3”) OR “Senior Researcher”, and additionally encrypt
the attributes of the messages used by brokers to route
events, using SDE. Subscribers will express ﬁlters as KP-
ABE decryption keys and encrypt the ﬁlter’s attributes us-
ing SDE. In this way, brokers are able to forward encrypted
events such as prescription information to all the interested
parties such as patient, HA, and DSM without learning any-
thing about the content of events or ﬁlters. Any attacker
able to read the messages that come in and out the broker
will not be able to learn anything either.
4. CONCLUSIONS
In this work, we presented a solution for providing conﬁ-
dentiality in pub/sub systems. Our solution is an encryption
scheme based on CP-ABE, KP-ABE and multi-user SDE.
Our scheme supports both the publication and the subscrip-
tion conﬁdentiality properties while at the same time does
not require publishers and subscribers to share secret keys.
Although events and ﬁlters are encrypted, brokers can still
perform event ﬁltering without learning any information. Fi-
nally, our scheme allows subscribers to express ﬁlters that
can deﬁne any monotonic and non-monotonic constraints on
events.
