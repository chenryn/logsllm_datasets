Subject: Issue with Running welcome.ts in Deno

Hello,

I recently installed Deno and encountered an issue while attempting to run the `welcome.ts` file, as mentioned in the documentation. Below are the details of the problem:

```
D:\deno>deno run https://deno.land/welcome.ts
Downloading https://deno.land/welcome.ts
WARN RS - Sending fatal alert BadCertificate
error: An error occurred trying to connect: invalid certificate: UnknownIssuer
error: An error occurred trying to connect: invalid certificate: UnknownIssuer
```

When I checked the version of Deno, here is what I found:
```
D:\deno>deno version
deno: 0.4.0
v8: 7.6.53
typescript: 3.4.1
```

Has anyone else experienced this issue? Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you,
[Your Name]
