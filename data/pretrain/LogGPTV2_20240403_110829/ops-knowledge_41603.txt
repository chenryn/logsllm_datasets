When attempting to install `pip` and Python, I encountered the following error message:

```
The directory '/Users/Parthenon/Library/Logs/pi' or its parent directory is not owned by the current user, and the debug log has been disabled. Please check the permissions and owner of that directory. If executing pip with sudo, you may want to use the -H flag.
```

Since I now need to use `sudo` for installations, I have run into this issue. Previously, I had Python and several libraries installed on my Mac, which was running Yosemite. After a recent clean wipe and reinstallation of the OS, I am encountering this prompt and am struggling to resolve it.

Additionally, my command line prompt has changed from `Parthenon$` to `Philips-MBP:~ Parthenon$`. I am the sole owner of this computer, and this is the only account on it. This problem seems to arise when upgrading to Python 3.4, as nothing appears to be in the expected locations, and `virtualenv` is not being installed where I anticipate it to be.

**Solution:**

One potential solution is to use the `--user` flag with `pip` to install packages without requiring `sudo`. For example:

```sh
pip install --user <package_name>
```

This approach worked for me in a similar situation.
