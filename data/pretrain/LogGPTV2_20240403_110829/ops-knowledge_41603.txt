User: While installing pip and python I have ran into a that says:

The directory '/Users/Parthenon/Library/Logs/pi' or its parent directory is not owned by the current user and the debug log has been disabled. Please check the permissions and owner of that directory. If executing pip with sudo, you may want the -H flag.

because I now have to install using sudo.
I had python and a handful of libraries already installed on my Mac, I'm running Yosemite. I recently had to do a clean wipe and then reinstall of the OS. Now I'm getting this prompt and I'm having trouble figuring out how to change it
Before my command line was Parthenon$ now it's Philips-MBP:~ Parthenon$
I am the sole owner of this computer and this is the only account on it. This seems to be a problem when upgrading to python 3.4, nothing seems to be in the right place, virtualenv isn't going where I expect it to, etc.
Assistant: pip install --user <package name> (no sudo needed) worked for me for a very similar problem.
