**Title:** Handbook of Research on Business Process Modeling  
**Authors:** Cardoso and Aalst  
**Publisher:** IGI Global (2009)

Over the past decade, there has been a significant expansion in the number of theories, technologies, standards, and tools that provide support for business processes. Concurrently, process support has become increasingly important in the development of information systems, particularly in the context of process-aware systems.

This convergence has created a pressing need among practitioners—such as researchers, system analysts, IT consultants, business analysts, and chief process officers—for a comprehensive book that offers a broad overview of this dynamic field from both academic and industrial perspectives. To address this need, the *Handbook of Research on Business Process Modeling* brings together contributions from leading experts, ensuring a diverse and robust base of knowledge and expertise.

The demand for a comprehensive and authoritative resource on business process modeling is evident among researchers from academia and industry, as well as workflow and BPM vendors. Stakeholders are often overwhelmed by the vast amount of BPM data available online, but they lack a coherent, 360-degree view of the field. When it comes to general theory, techniques, and technologies, publications often refer to a variety of survey articles, with no single source emerging as the definitive reference.

This handbook aims to fill that gap, providing a unified and authoritative resource that serves as a common ground for the BPM community.
