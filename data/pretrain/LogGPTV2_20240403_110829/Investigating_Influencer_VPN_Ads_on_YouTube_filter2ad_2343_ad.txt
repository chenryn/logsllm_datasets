What do the adversaries do?
VPN ads describe different
adversaries as threatening different kinds of assets, using
different tactics and mechanisms. The connection between ad-
versaries, their actions, and the assets they target is illustrated
in Figure 3. We distinguish surveillance (passively observing)
from more active efforts to collect data, based on nuanced
ways that YouTubers describe threats. We separately distin-
guish forcefully taking, when the YouTuber uses language
implying violence or attack, such as “stealing” or “grabbing.”
ISPs are typically associated with
surveilling (“spying,” “tracking,” “snooping”; 21 videos, 5.3M
views) and then disseminating (“sell,” “blackmail,” “share”)
internet activity data (11 videos, 3.5M views). One YouTuber
noted that the VPN can “keep the ISP from out of your
business . . . keep them from knowing what you’re looking
at.” [96] Given that ISPs have signiﬁcant control over and
visibility into users’ connections,
this threat model seems
reasonable. Similarly and also reasonably, data-monetizing
companies are typically associated with capturing internet
activities or users’ “data” (7 videos, 4.8M views).
Threats from governments are typically less speciﬁc: they
are vaguely associated with surveilling users and everything
they do (11 videos, 3.1M views). However, in ﬁve videos
(3.6M views), YouTubers warned against internet regulation.
One YouTuber [97] expressed concern about potential changes
to EU copyright laws [98].
Interestingly, only a small number of YouTubers emphasized
the threat of censorship (7 videos, 2.7M views). This can
be potentially attributed to relatively low censorship levels
in major English-speaking countries [99]. In contrast, many
more VPN ads discuss the threat of content restrictions, such
as those set by media streaming services (37 videos, 14.2M
views; discussed further in § IV-C4).
Prior work suggests that people often view hackers as
mysteriously powerful with malicious intent as well as extraor-
dinary skills and abilities [35, 100, 101]. In line with this, in
VPN ads, hackers are associated with a wide variety of attacks
on a range of assets. Most frequently, they are associated
with forcefully taking ( i.e., “stealing,” “taking,” “grabbing”)
ﬁnancial assets (9 videos, 5.6M views), credentials (8 videos,
4.9M views), and sensitive or personal data (15 videos, 6.0M
views). Hackers and nebulous bad actors are also described
as broadly surveilling users and their internet activities (18
videos, 7.6M views). As an example, one YouTuber asks, “Did
you know that you can be spied on by some random hacker
dude using the same network?”[102]. Notably, 28 of 44 videos
that mention “public Wi-Fi” also mention “hackers” or other
nebulous adversaries as threats.
How does the VPN address the threat?
YouTubers
often explicitly connect the VPN to the threat (131 videos,
37.2M views). The most frequent messages are that the VPN
will prevent the threat (77 videos, 23.2M views) or protect
some asset from it (32 videos, 5.2M views). For example,
“ExpressVPN lets you safely surf on public Wi-Fi without
being snooped on, without your data stolen or hacked” [103].
Other videos contain statements that only mention the threat,
thereby implying but not directly stating that the VPN can
provide protection (102 videos, 35.1M views). For example,
one YouTuber lists multiple threats from multiple adversaries
before noting that ExpressVPN is the solution [104].
4) Accessing more content: Aside from security and pri-
vacy, a large minority of YouTubers mention VPNs as a tool
to obtain more content online (86 videos, 29.2M views). This
point is typically made using one or more of three common
messages: (1) obtaining more content (e.g., “access,” “get”; 39
videos, 10.4M views); (2) consuming content (e.g., “watch,”
“stream,” “download”; 56 videos, 23.5M views), and (3)
circumventing content restrictions (e.g., “unblock,” “bypass”;
28 videos, 8.2M views). We also found many instances of
YouTubers mentioning speciﬁc shows and/or speciﬁc plat-
forms (46 videos, 12.1M views). Netﬂix was the most common
platform, mentioned in 43 videos with 11.7M total views (e.g.,
“It allows me to bing watch more series on Netﬂix” [105]).
In a minority of cases, the YouTuber discusses access to a

“website,” without going into speciﬁcs.
A number of ads emphasize using VPNs when accessing
illegal or otherwise questionable content (22 videos, 4.2M
views). Eleven videos heavily imply acquiring illegal content
(e.g., via torrenting; 534.4K views). One hints: “You should
buy all your stuff completely legally. . . but just in case” [106].
A few discuss user-managed streaming platforms such as
Kodi or Plex, which are frequently used for content piracy
(4 videos, 43.3K views) [107]. Others mention using a VPN
to access “shady” content (e.g., “we all like to browse shady
sites” [108]) as well as for content we labeled as conspiracy
theories or disinformation, such as “searching for Q[anon]’s
latest posts” [109] (9 videos, 3.7M views).
5) Usability and performance: VPN ads commonly em-
phasize usability and performance features. Most frequently,
the ad claims the promoted VPN is easy to use (81 videos,
22.3M views), often mentioning that a VPN can be activated
with “one click” (26 videos, 5.7M views). One YouTuber says,
“It’s super modern and super simplistic. . . . It will connect you
to a VPN just like that” [110].
Sixty-seven videos (25.4M views) mention support for mul-
tiple platforms (e.g., Linux, iOS) and some tout simultaneous
connections on one subscription (30 videos, 6.0M views).
A smaller number of VPN ads emphasize network per-
formance and size. This includes reporting that the VPN’s
network has many servers (24 videos, 14.3M views) in various
countries (36 videos, 18.9M views), has fast connection speeds
(48 videos, 23.4M views), does not slow down the user’s
device (e.g.,“You can use it on all of your devices and you
won’t even notice it” [111]; 17 videos, 1.5M views), or offers
unlimited data (12 videos, 3.6M views). Surprisingly, a few
ads claim the VPN will make certain connections faster (4
videos, 908.1K views).
6) Who uses a VPN and when?: Many VPN ads contain
statements about who uses or should use a VPN, as well as
under what scenarios it should be used.
Who uses a VPN?
Many YouTubers advertise in part by
mentioning people who use the VPNs. In many cases, the
YouTuber themselves claims to use one (90 videos, 33.7M
views). In other cases, the YouTuber reports that someone
they know uses it (sometimes perplexingly implying that
they themselves don’t; 5 videos, 854.6K views), that fellow
subscribers use it (3 videos, 1.7M views), or simply that many
people use it (7 videos, 3.7M views). One YouTuber suggests
that paranoid people use the VPN (8 videos, 290.5K views). In
addition, some YouTubers say that a VPN has positive reviews
from prominent reviewers (16 videos, 4.3M views).
When should VPNs be used?
Some YouTubers mention
speciﬁc places or situations when a VPN could or should be
used. Common examples include when using public Wi-Fi
(43 videos, 20.0M views), when traveling (38 videos, 12.4M
views), at home (17 videos, 3.4M views), while playing games
(8 videos, 3.0M views), during e-commerce (7 videos, 2.3M
views), or for cryptocurrency tasks (5 videos, 73.4K views).
A small number of YouTubers suggest VPNs need to be used
all the time (4 videos, 311.2K views).
D. Potentially problematic claims
While labeling videos, we noticed many questionable tech-
nical claims. For the purpose of evaluating claims, we assume
the average user expects data security solutions from the VPN
they’re using; the following deﬁnition of a VPN aligns well
with this assumption:
An alternative model is where the customer trusts
the service provider to provide a secure managed
VPN service. . . . the customer trusts that packets will
not be misdirected, injected into the network in an
unauthorized manner, snooped on, modiﬁed in tran-
sit, or subjected to trafﬁc analysis by unauthorized
parties [112].
VPNs cannot interfere with operations carried out at the
party the client is communicating with.
1) Overpromises and exaggerated threats: We observed
several VPN ads suggesting complete protection against any
or all threats, sometimes even advertising a worry-free inter-
net experience (25 videos, 5.9M views). In one example, a
gaming YouTuber states, “I promise if you go ahead and give
NordVPN a try, you won’t ever have to worry about anything
on the internet again” [113].
Others exaggerate threats by overstating the scope of the
potential threat: for example, claiming that bad actors are
“listening to your every single move” [114]. YouTubers also
sometimes refer to implausibly large numbers of attackers,
in some cases suggesting that “anyone” can be a threat (35
videos, 6.2M views). One YouTuber says “anyone with any
sort of knowledge of anything can access your information
and data” [115].
2) Financial information and credentials: YouTubers fre-
quently noted that VPNs provide protection for ﬁnancial and
authentication data. Some (18 videos, 7.4M views) state that
VPNs protect ﬁnancial assets (e.g., “credit cards,” “PayPal,”
“money,” “ﬁnancial information”), and one speciﬁcally warns
about adversaries “stealing your identity and your [expletive]
bank information” [116]. Other VPN ads (21 videos, 7.8M
views) claim protection against
theft of credentials (e.g.,
“passwords,” “logins”). One notes that with a VPN, “No one
can see your passwords” [117].
In practice, the vast majority of all site loads—anecdotally
including nearly all ﬁnancial and authentication services—
already run over encrypted connections (e.g., HTTPS) [118].
As such, in most cases the encrypted VPN connection does
not actually provide additional protection. While it is true that
various SSL/TLS/HTTPS attacks exist that might allow an
adversary on the same network to access encrypted data [119–
121], we argue that these threats are much narrower in scope
than the implication in many ads: without a VPN, ﬁnancial
and authentication data is readily available for the taking.

and date. VPN companies with fewer than 10 videos in the VPN ad
sample are grouped as “Others.”
Further, it isn’t clear that VPN services, which eventually must
communicate over HTTPS with the website the user intends to
visit, would not themselves be vulnerable to similar ﬂaws. We
note that some YouTubers (13 videos, 6.9M views) do connect
threats to ﬁnancial and authentication data to the need for
VPNs speciﬁcally when using public Wi-Fi, possibly assuming
a more nuanced threat model.
3) Commercial use of data: A ﬂagship feature many
YouTubers describe is the ability for VPNs to block adver-
saries (“companies,” “ISPs,” “data companies,” “social media
companies,” etc.) from collecting or processing user data for
commercial purposes (50 videos, 10.9M views). One YouTu-
ber notes that “more times than not, that data is sold to third
party advertisers” [122].
Some VPNs do implement network-based (e.g., DNS [123])
solutions to limit collection of user data. While network-
based ﬁlters are less intrusive, solutions that do not inspect
and modify user packets might not be able to adequately
block the sophisticated data collection methods rampant on the
web today [124–126]. Inspecting and modifying trafﬁc (e.g.,
through browser plugins9), however, violates the assumptions
of the privacy VPNs might provide.
This points to a potential conﬂict in the basic idea of what a
VPN is, and therefore what users of a VPN might reasonably
expect or assume about its functionality. This disconnect—not
all VPNs offer such protections—may lead users to develop
confused mental models.
In addition, some free VPNs violate users’ trust by tracking
them and injecting ads into websites they browse [9]. Some
popular VPNs, including some of those in our dataset, have
also been accused of collecting and monetizing user data [42].
4) Other false and confusing statements: We noted several
additional false and confusing statements.
Five identical VPN ads (110.3K views) from a single
channel contained confusing and likely misleading visuals

about IP masking. In the video, they show a device’s IPv4
and IPv6 addresses to show that the IP address has changed.
It’s unlikely that the public IP has actually changed [127].
We noted four videos (791.5K views) with false technical
claims, including that VPNs would protect against server-
side threats [128] or would ensure a user has no online
identiﬁers [129].
E. Comparing VPNs
We next describe differences and trends we observed com-
paring ads over time and for different VPN companies.
When did they advertise? We ﬁrst see VPN ads appear in
our data toward the end of 2016; they have increased steadily
ever since (Figure 4). We note an additional increase around
March 2020, which is reﬂected in Google Trends [130] and
attributed to COVID-19 in market reports [8].
We observe some differences over time among individual
VPN companies. ExpressVPN (54 videos, 20.5M views) and
Tunnelbear (22 videos, 5.4M views) appear to be the oldest
advertisers. NordVPN ﬁrst appears in our dataset toward the
end of 2017 but is featured in more videos (60) and has more
views (21.5M) than any other company. SurfShark starts to
advertise in February of 2019; with a spike in videos in mid-
2020, it becomes a sizable chunk of our dataset (26 videos,
5.7M views). Private Internet Access, also known as PIA,
appears in a relatively small number of videos (18) but has
the third most views (7.6M).
Interestingly, VirtualShield (33 videos, 1.4M views) rep-
resents a majority of VPN ads between March and October
2018, before decreasing its footprint. This likely relates to a
partnership with The Next News Network [93, 114, 127, 131],
which consistently produces ∼10 sponsored videos per day.
What videos do different companies advertise in?
Figure 6 shows that most VPN companies advertise on a
diverse selection of content categories,
including Lifestyle
(e.g., [88, 105]), Video games (e.g., [132]), Society (e.g., [94]),
Technology (e.g., [106]), Entertainment (e.g., [80]), and others.

VirtualShield and Tunnelbear, however, tend to advertise
repeatedly on the same channels and categories.
In our
dataset, VirtualShield exclusively sponsored right-wing chan-
nels (e.g., The Still Report10, No B.S. [78], The Next News
Network [93, 114, 127, 131]), and conspiratorial channels
(e.g., Leak Project [135]). These channels were frequently
