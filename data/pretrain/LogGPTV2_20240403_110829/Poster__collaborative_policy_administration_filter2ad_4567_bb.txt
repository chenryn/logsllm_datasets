design process and subsequent involvement in the 
iterative design and testing of the office intervention.
Being involved in the design process has 
mostly made it glaringly obvious why the 
medical community is struggling with 
patient education initiatives. The processes, 
theories, etc., that designers utilize to 
create any product are well established 
and introspective. I don’t think the medical 
community uses any well-established protocol 
or design methodologies to create any patient 
information. Furthermore, most often medical 
patient information is uni-directional; e.g., 
“Here is a pamphlet of information we think 
is important that you should read.” “Human 
centered design” creates a product around a 
conversation. This is the new era of medicine 
- the times are changing from “I am the doctor 
and this is what you should do ‘Because I said 
so,’” to an era of informed patients and shared 
decision-making.
Participants truly saw themselves as designers, and 
the skills and methods they learned through the 
sessions carried into their own practices. By becoming 
part of the process, they were equipped to adapt it to 
their own needs in future scenarios. One participant 
remarked,
We get to make sure our most important 
messages are in the materials but you help 
us do it in a way that is most appealing to 
our patients. We learn a lot about what our 
patients want and need from a conversation 
with their doctor, which carries into how we 
approach problems outside the realm of the 
specific design question.

THE RESULTS OF THE CO-CREATIVE PROCESS: 
FITWITS MD
Fitwits MD was the result of the co-creative process 
described above. It consists of a set of seventeen 
educational flashcards developed to help physicians 
start a conversation with their patients about obesity, 
family history, body mass index (BMI), and practical 
directives regarding portion control, nutrition and 
fitness discussions. The medical doctor starts the 
conversation with patients while the flashcards invite 
various engaging Fitwits characters to join in helping 
to clarify confusing health terms. These characters 
further define obesity and spark the dialogue about 
an obesity-related family history of type-2 diabetes, 
high blood pressure, and heart disease. Fitwits MD 
assists primary care family health physicians to 
increase health fluency and to affect wellness choices 
of children and their families. The tool allows all 
patients and their families the opportunity learn the 
content regardless of their diagnosis. Upon diagnosis 
continued interaction with the core health messages 
increases awareness of the problem. By design, the 
program is able to accommodate and teach the wide 
range of families.
EVALUATION AND OUTCOME
Physicians reported that the Fitwits MD intervention 
facilitated conversation between physicians, patients 
and their families. They found the intervention 
engaging, and patients and their families were 
receptive to the material presented, which led to 
extended conversations and questions. Most felt the 
intervention allowed physicians, patients, and their 
families to identify and discuss behaviors relating to 
diet and nutrition (e.g. consuming fast food; amount 
of soda consumed in a day; number of weekly family 
meals) and activities (e.g. number of weekly visits 
to the gym; number of hours spent watching TV or 
playing on the computer each night). The study also 
indicated that Fitwits MD improved the physicians’ 
level of comfort and competence when discussing 
obesity prevention with children and parents 
(McGaffey et al. 2011).
THE  CO-DESIGN PROCESS IN PRACTICE
The term co-design refers to a creative process 
through which collective creativity unfolds over the 
span of a design process (Sanders and Stappers 2008).

Sanders argued that participation in co-design activity 
reflects the creativity levels demonstrated in peoples’ 
lives. As the level of creativity grows, so does expertise, 
interest, passion, and effort (Frascara 2006). In high 
paced domains, such as healthcare delivery, tools and 
services are appropriated, adapted, and modified by 
the community of use (Nardi and O’Day 1996). We 
have come to understand that co-design is critical for 
the emergence, dissemination, and adaptation phases 
linked to communication tools and services, in our 
case physicians offices. 
In our experience working with healthcare 
professionals and families, we learned that in addition 
to creativity levels of participants, co-design occurs by 
helping participants overcome barriers to participation. 
We identified four common barriers to co-design 
participation: 1.) limited understanding of the field of 
design 2.) the paradigm shift required to change from 
using to adapting and creating tools 3.) limited time 
available, and 4.) limited trust in the overall value of 
the design process. 
We use three terms to describe the necessary 
scaffolding phases required for an effective co-design 
process: emergence, dissemination, and adaptation. 
The emergence phase involves the creation of a new 
product and/or service in a design-based approach via 
participatory design methods, co-creation, and iterative 
testing. The dissemination phase involves recruiting, 
training, and championing the new product and/or 
service in the community of use. The adaptation phase 
involves empowering continued innovation cycles in 
the community of use. Innovation may involve product 
innovation, service innovation, process innovation, and/
or social innovation. 
In summary, participants in a co-design process 
experience the emergence of a design solution; others 
are involved in the dissemination of the solution in 
their organization and practice; and others yet are 
involved in the adaptation phase innovating, products, 
services, and processes.
We argue that an integral part of design research 
is missing —co-creation cannot simply stop after 
deployment of product or service; designers must 
instead strive for a process that enables co-design. 
This will help ensure that our community of use takes 
ownership of both the process and the outcome. In 
our study co-design proves to be a process that is 
adaptable by non-designers.

PHYSICIANS AS CO-DESIGNERS
The physicians’ as co-designers is evidenced by 
the quotes below in the emergence, dissemination, 
and adaptation phases. In the emergence phase, 
participants in the co-design process are engaged 
in thinking, making, creating, and evaluating the 
Fitwits MD intervention. In the dissemination 
phase, participants brainstormed and implemented 
protocols to deliver the Fitwits MD intervention. In the 
adaptation phase, participants developed new ways to 
engage physicians and patients with the Fitwits MD 
intervention. 
During the emergence phase physicians learned about 
design and how to apply design methods to new 
challenges. Below a physician compares the design 
process and medical practice describing barriers 
physicians face.
Having watched and admired the design 
process, I suppose it is something like the 
art of medicine but with observation and 
reflective listening by designers to several 
parties, all of whom must trust that their 
thoughts and ideas are appreciated and 
are not subservient. That is an interesting 
proposition for any physician, who might 
expect to produce some ideas that trump 
others – but that is not the case. It so 
happens that the critical work really 
turns on the ideas, learning styles, and 
playfulness of children and oftentimes, of 
parents who may not have profited from 
formal education. 
The design process engaged some physicians to the 
point that they willingly took on more work, even 
amidst already hectic schedules.
The collaborative design process generates 
more reflections, ideas and voluntary work 
than one might expect to contribute and 
there is an amazement and excitement 
that is palpable, especially as a tool or 
strategy is generated that almost seems 
“out of thin air” from diverse conversations 
and activities in design workshops.

Despite months of careful planning and iterating on 
the design of the tool, few interventions occurred 
during the first three months of the dissemination 
phase. It was unexpected that the tool would be 
unsuccessful or underutilized, since without the tool 
in use the team would have little to evaluate. The 
apparent lack of interest on the part of physicians 
motivated the design, medical, and evaluation teams 
to brainstorm solutions to increase the interventions. 
The resulting solutions were: (a) new dissemination 
protocols (b) assigned roles for dissemination 
(i.e., recruits, trainers, and champions); (c) physical 
reminders (e.g., buttons, screen savers), and (d) an 
intervention challenge game between the three 
participating Family Health Centers (FHC’s) to 
encourage participation. 
The resulting dissemination phase protocols for the 
staff described three roles related to the dissemination 
process: recruits, trainers, and champions. Once these 
were put in place, patients started to receive the 
Fitwits MD intervention, trainers learned the Fitwits 
materials and trained others, and champions organized 
and disseminated the intervention. These roles were 
developed to make the Fitwits MD intervention occur 
smoothly. 
To help the office staff and physicians remember 
to deliver the Fitwits MD intervention, the team 
created “What is Fitwits?” buttons to wear and 
Fitwits computer screen savers for the computers 
in the visiting rooms. The physicians also launched 
an intervention challenge in the three FHCs to 
encourage competition in the deployment of Fitwits. 
The physicians in one FHC launched a poster contest 
to win the competition by promoting an increased 
awareness of Fitwits in their medical center. The 
poster competition engaged both staff and patients, 
and increased participation in Fitwits overall. The 
positive response to the poster competition in the 
waiting room inspired the design team and the 
medical team to add a mural and interactive game 
to engage patients with the Fitwits MD prior to the 
physicians visit. 
Additionally, without the prompting of the Fitwits 
design team, FHC’s who accommodated the Fitwits 
MD intervention voluntarily made changes in the 
snack choices that the office staff and physicians 
brought into their office (such as fewer chips and 
more vegetables). Likewise, the outreach activities 
of the physicians continue to expand the network of 
Fitwits MD and bring the Fitwits message to people in 
other organizations (community centers, homes). This 
includes training social workers who visit individuals 
who are morbidly obese and cannot leave their homes.
CONCLUSION
Obesity prevention is challenging for physicians in 
the office during well-child visits. The boundaries 
of problems related to obesity prevention are tied 
to context and the actors involved. We framed our 
argument around the value of co-creation, and 
identified scaffolds within the co-design process 
in developing effective health communications, 
prevention and behavior change.

IMPLICATIONS FOR:
DESIGN PRACTICE
Long-term systemic change often takes time and patience. currently, the practice 
of deign does not take this into consideration. time is needed to develop an 
understanding of how and why a design solution has had an impact and ways 
change is measured/evaluated.
Service design helping to change policy:
a.  Health literacy is a service and not an artifact, even though artifacts may 
facilitate the process that is being delivered to people. 
b.  A health literacy endeavor helps people (in this case healthcare providers) 
learn what they need know what to do, and then how to act appropriately. 
In other words, know what to do, to do the right thing. Knowledge without 
action is similar to uninformed action. 
c.  Health literacy applies to individuals, family, organizations, communities, and 
government. When addressing all levels individual behavior motivates others 
to change, resulting policy changes. 
d.  Willingness to change plays a large role in ability to change behavior. 
Behavior change is a process in of itself. 
e.  Many people are unaware, unwilling, or threatened by healthy lifestyle 
choices, so the idea is to create a safe environment for people to learn, try, 
and practice healthy lifestyles. Developing a service design model that can 
improve and sustain the practice of care is critical.

ABOUT THE AUTHORS
Kristin Hughes (PI:EMAIL) is an associate professor in the School of Design at Carnegie Mellon University. Her 
work focuses on design as a catalyst for community and civic engagement. Hughes designs products and services 
that allow participants to shape their learning space and sustain learning over time. 
Currently Kristin is runs a program called Fitwits. Fitwits is a health improvement methodology and technology 
for patients, their families and the doctors they visit. Built on a foundation of co-care, or collaborative care, 
Fitwits uses character-based agents and game-based, health-inspired activities to engage children in meaningful, 
measurable health improvement practices. Through a set of digital and analog delivery tools, the solution is able 
to provide parents and doctors greater visibility into the health-impacting decisions a child makes so they can 
positively motivate change.
Prior to developing Fitwits, Hughes worked collaboratively with University of Pittsburgh Out of School Learning 
Environments (UPCLOSE) on Click! Urban Adventure, and exlanatoids. Click! Urban Adventure, is an interactive 
role-playing game designed to immerse middle school girls in discipline-specific science, technology, engineering 
and mathematics activities. Explanatoids brought science, technology, engineering and mathematics topics to the 
general public by placing signs and other artifacts in public spaces to encourage curiosity and understanding of 
science in everyday life.
Peter Scupelli (PI:EMAIL ) is an assistant professor in the School of Design. He teaches both 
undergraduate and graduate level courses (e.g., Senior Studio, Basic Interaction, Interaction Design Seminar II).
Peter’s design research centers on interaction design for artifacts, environments, and services. Current topics of 
interest include: behavior change linked to sustainable, healthy lifestyles and design evaluation.
Peter’s training and career path link architecture, interaction design, and human-computer interaction research. He 
completed his Ph.D. at the Human-Computer Interaction Institute in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie 
Mellon University. His dissertation focused on how the architecture of the built environment around large schedule 
displays and nursing control desks support coordination services in surgical suites.
Peter has a master’s degree in interaction design from the School of Design at Carnegie Mellon University. His 
thesis essay explored the effect of affordances in communities of practice. His thesis project entailed making 
process work visible to design teams throughout a project in time-shared project rooms.
