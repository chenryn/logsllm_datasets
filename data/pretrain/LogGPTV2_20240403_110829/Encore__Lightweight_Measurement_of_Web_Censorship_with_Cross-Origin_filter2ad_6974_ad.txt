### Homepage Analysis in February 2014

In February 2014, the homepage of a professor received 1,171 visits. The majority of these visitors were from the United States, but the site also attracted more than 10 users from 10 other countries. Notably, 16% of the visitors were from countries with well-known web filtering policies, including India, China, Pakistan, the UK, and South Korea. This indicates that deploying measurement tasks on academic web pages can yield data from a diverse and representative set of locations.

Of the total visitors, 999 attempted to run a measurement task. The remaining traffic was largely confirmed to be automated, originating from the campus' security scanner. Additionally, 45% of visitors stayed on the page for more than 10 seconds, which is sufficient time to execute at least one measurement task and report its results. A smaller subset, 35%, remained for over a minute, allowing them to run multiple tasks.

### Pilot Deployment of Encore

Our small-scale pilot deployment of Encore is indicative of the types of sites where we anticipate Encore will be deployed in the near future. While the adoption of Encore by a high-traffic website would significantly increase the volume of collected measurements, grassroots recruitment remains essential. Encore's effectiveness depends on a variety of origin sites, making it more difficult for adversaries to suppress our measurement collection by blocking access to all origins.

### Will Webmasters Install Encore?

Encore does not directly target specific demographics for measurement collection; instead, it collects data from users who visit websites that have installed Encore scripts. If these sites are globally popular (e.g., Google), Encore can achieve a broad and diverse sample of users. Conversely, if the sites are only popular in certain regions, the measurements will be limited to those areas.

Recruiting webmasters to include Encore’s measurement scripts is feasible for several reasons:

1. **Low Cost**: Installing Encore on a website incurs minimal costs. Our prototype adds only 100 bytes to each origin page and requires no additional requests or connections between the client and the origin server. The measurements run asynchronously after the page has loaded, minimizing the impact on the user experience. However, there is some network overhead when loading cross-origin resources, which could be a concern for users with bandwidth caps or slow, shared network connections.

2. **Incentives for Webmasters**:
   - **Interest in Transparency**: Many webmasters may support Encore due to their interest in measuring web filtering and promoting transparency in government censorship.
   - **Reciprocity Agreement**: We could offer a reciprocity agreement where webmasters, in exchange for installing our measurement scripts, could add their own site to Encore’s list of targets and receive notifications about their site’s availability from Encore’s client population.

### Measurements and Validation

To validate the soundness of Encore’s measurement tasks, we conducted both controlled experiments and comparisons with independent reports of filtering from other research studies. We have implemented and released all components of Encore described in Section 5 and have collected seven months of measurements from May 2014 through January 2015.

At least 17 volunteers have deployed Encore on their sites, though the actual number is likely higher, as 3/4 of the measurements come from sites that strip the Referer: header when sending results. We recorded 141,626 measurements from 88,260 distinct IPs in 170 countries. Countries like China, India, the United Kingdom, and Brazil reported at least 1,000 measurements each, while Egypt, South Korea, Iran, Pakistan, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia reported more than 100 measurements. These countries practice various forms of web filtering.

### Soundness of Measurement Tasks

To confirm the soundness of Encore’s measurements, we built a web censorship testbed with configurations that emulate seven varieties of DNS, IP, and HTTP filtering. For three months, approximately 30% of clients were instructed to measure resources hosted by the testbed using the four task types from Table 1. For example, the images task type detected DNS blocking by attempting to load an image from an invalid domain and observing the task's reporting of filtering.

Verification is straightforward for the image, style sheet, and script task types, as they provide binary feedback on whether a resource successfully loaded. Encore collected 8,573 measurements for these task types, with no true positives and few false positives. For instance, clients in India, known for unreliable network connectivity, contributed to a 5% false positive rate for images.

Verifying the inline frame task type requires more care, as it infers filtering from the time taken to load resources. Figure 7 compares the load times for cached and uncached single-pixel images from 1,099 globally distributed Encore clients. Cached images typically load within tens of milliseconds, whereas uncached images take at least 50 ms longer. Clients with little difference in load times were located on the same local network as the server.

### Detecting Web Filtering

We instructed the remaining 70% of clients to measure resources suspected of filtering, aiming to independently verify previously reported web filtering. We focused on Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter, as these sites pose minimal additional risk to users. Browsers already routinely contact these sites via cross-origin requests without user consent.

To detect consistently inaccessible resources, we used the image task type. We modeled each measurement success as a Bernoulli random variable with parameter p = 0.7, assuming that, in the absence of filtering, clients should successfully load resources at least 70% of the time. We used a statistical hypothesis test to distinguish sporadic or localized failures from consistent failures indicating web filtering.

### Ethical and Security Considerations

Deploying Encore raises ethical and security concerns, from collecting measurements from unsuspecting users to potential attacks on client measurements or collection infrastructure.

#### Safe Resources to Measure
Encore induces clients to request URLs that might be incriminating in some countries. Balancing ubiquitous yet uninteresting URLs (e.g., online advertisers, Google Analytics) and obscure URLs that governments are likely to censor (e.g., human rights groups) is challenging. While our work does not prescribe a specific use case, we recognize the risks involved.

#### Benefit and Risk
The benefit of Encore is clear: it enables researchers to collect new data about filtering from diverse vantage points. However, the risks are less defined, as laws against accessing filtered content vary by country. There is no ground truth about the legal and safety risks posed by collecting network measurements.

#### Ethical Implications
Balancing the benefits and risks of Encore raises ethical questions that are not addressed by conventional standards. As our understanding of these implications evolved, so did the set of measurements we collect and report. Table 2 highlights key milestones in Encore’s deployment, culminating in a more restricted set of measurements.

#### Institutional Review Boards (IRBs)
The IRBs at Georgia Tech and Princeton declined to formally review Encore because it does not collect or analyze Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and is not human subjects research. However, Encore can expose users to some level of risk. We have focused on developing the measurement technology and leading a responsible dialogue on the ethical implications of such tools.

#### Informed Consent
Obtaining informed consent is impractical for large-scale network measurements. It would require explaining nuanced technical concepts across language barriers, reducing the scale and scope of measurements. Instead, we focus on reducing risk to uninformed users through repeated iteration and consultation with ethics experts.

### Conclusion

Encore offers a powerful tool for measuring web filtering from diverse and representative locations. While it presents ethical and security challenges, ongoing efforts to address these issues aim to ensure that the benefits of Encore can be realized responsibly.
