**Current behavior**
If a subclass component has any field marked `@ViewChild`, any other
`@ViewChild` field in an abstract superclass will not evaluate.
**Expected/desired behavior**
Both the superclass `@ViewChild` and the subclass `@ViewChild` should be
populated.
**Reproduction of the problem**
https://plnkr.co/edit/w5EvslQbHMMVqjx8v52U
The superclass `@ViewChild` **does populate** from the subclass template, but
only if the subclass `@ViewChild` is commented out.
If uncommented, the subclass `@ViewChild` is populated, but the superclass one
is not.
**What is the expected behavior?**
Both the superclass `@ViewChild` and the subclass `@ViewChild` should be
populated.
**What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**
Multiple components that inherit common code but supply their own template.
The linked plunkr demonstrates the use case where the abstract class
encapsulates all the code and logic for the common feature of performing a
search, while the child component provides the specific template in which the
`#searchInput` element can be found and whatever other divergent behavior.
