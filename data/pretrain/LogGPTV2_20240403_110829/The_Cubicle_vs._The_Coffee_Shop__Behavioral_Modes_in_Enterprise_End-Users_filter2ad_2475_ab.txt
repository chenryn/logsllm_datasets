### User Behavior Diversity in Different Environments

We observed a significant diversity in user behavior across different network environments. Some users stay on the VPN for 3 to 4 times as long as they do inside the enterprise network, while others exhibit the opposite behavior (as seen in Figure 2(c), where points are spread equally on both sides of the diagonal). Users whose points lie near the extreme right side of the plot are likely frequent travelers or telecommuters, making their primary work environment through a VPN. Even within the "inside" mode, there is considerable diversity: some users have working sessions lasting 8 to 9 hours, while others have median session times of just 1 or 2 hours.

The key takeaway from these statistics is that we observe two types of diversity:
1. **Individual Diversity**: Each user's time spent in a particular environment varies significantly.
2. **Cross-User Diversity**: Users' behaviors differ widely, with some showing similar trends and others exhibiting completely opposite patterns.

### Destination Port Diversity

Next, we examined whether there are quantitative differences in how network services are used in different environments. We used TCP and UDP destination ports as a proxy for "network service." We focused on two groups of ports:
1. **Web Ports**: Associated with HTTP and web traffic (ports 80, 88, 8080, 443).
2. **MS Ports**: Associated with Windows-based services (ports 135, 389, 445, 1025-1029).

The metric of comparison was the fraction of connections corresponding to a particular port (or group of ports) in each environment. For each user and environment, we computed this ratio as the number of connections on that port divided by the total number of connections in the same environment. This captures the percentage of a user's activities in each environment spent on a given service.

Figure 3 plots this metric for three different port sets, comparing behavior across the "inside" and "outside" modes. In each scatter plot, a point represents an individual user, with (x, y) coordinates indicating the connection fractions for inside and outside, respectively.

- **Figure 3(a)**: Shows the statistic for HTTP traffic. The points are scattered, indicating that the percentage of activity spent browsing the web differs between the two environments. Some users generate more HTTP connections inside, while others do so outside. Points along the x-axis represent users who only use HTTP when inside the enterprise, possibly using a second machine at home for general browsing.
- **Figure 3(b)**: Similar observations for SSL traffic, with most points off the diagonal.
- **Figure 3(c)**: Dramatic differences in the use of MS ports, which is expected due to their role in infrastructure services.

These plots confirm that activity profiles for a user are not consistent across different environments. For some users, the differences are small but non-zero, while for others, they are dramatic. Therefore, any profiling methodology must be environment-aware.

### Thresholds on Behavioral Anomaly Detectors

Most enterprise end-hosts use Host Intrusion Detection Systems (H-IDS) for security, which include anomaly detectors. These detectors often define thresholds to distinguish normal from abnormal behavior. We investigated whether such thresholds vary across different environments for a given user.

We examined three types of features: TCP connections, UDP connections, and ICMP packet-pair counts. For each protocol, we counted the number of connections in 15-minute windows and built histograms for each user to determine the 95th percentile threshold.

- **Figure 4(a)**: Shows the 95th percentile values for TCP connections. Most points are off the diagonal, indicating different thresholds in different environments.
- **Figure 4(b)**: Compares UDP flows in VPN and inside environments, showing more UDP flows in the VPN.
- **Figure 4(c)**: Compares ICMP traffic across outside and VPN environments, showing very little ICMP traffic outside.

These observations strongly support the need for environment-aware anomaly detection. A single threshold value is insufficient for all environments, as it can lead to false positives or missed attacks.

### Conclusion

Our study of common user-behavior features shows that most users exhibit significant diversity in how they use their machines in different environments. This diversity impacts the configuration of anomaly detectors and has implications for various applications, including resource allocation, VPN tunneling, and virtual machine configurations. Future work will explore how environmentally-aware profile information can improve these applications and determine the minimal number of common profiles needed to capture the entire set of user behaviors.
