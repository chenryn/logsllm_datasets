On a short, wide monitor or possibly a tablet in landscape mode, you cannot
scroll down the menu even though it's fixed positioning and very long. Thus,
you literally cannot click on the bottom options of the left documentation
menu.
For example, make your window something like 1400x600 and open this. Try to
click on any of the bottom links on the menu.

Related, at the bottom of the page, the fixed menu overlays the page footer
and makes it impossible to read/click anything on the left side of the footer.
Possible fixes could include unfixing the menu position or allow scrolling of
the menu div independently of the rest of the page.
