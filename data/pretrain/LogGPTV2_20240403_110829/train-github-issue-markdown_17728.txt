When using a short, wide monitor or a tablet in landscape mode, the fixed-position menu on the left side of the documentation becomes problematic. Despite its long length, the menu does not allow for vertical scrolling, making it impossible to access the bottom options.

To illustrate, resize your browser window to approximately 1400x600 pixels and visit the following page:
- [Bootstrap Components: Page Header](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#page-header)

You will notice that you cannot click on the bottom links in the menu.

Additionally, at the bottom of the page, the fixed menu overlaps with the footer, obscuring the content on the left side and preventing interaction with those elements.

Possible solutions to this issue could include:
- Unfixing the menu's position, allowing it to scroll with the rest of the page.
- Enabling independent scrolling within the menu div, so users can still access all menu items regardless of the screen height.

**Edit:** The issue is reproducible with a window size of 1400x600 pixels.
