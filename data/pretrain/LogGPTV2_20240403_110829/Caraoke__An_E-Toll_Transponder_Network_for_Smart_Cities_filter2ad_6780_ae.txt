Figure 15—Speed Detection Accuracy. Figure shows the
car speed detected by Caraoke versus its actual speed.
Caraoke detected the speed to within 8% over a range of dif-
ferent speeds

ﬁle has one dominant peak. To conﬁrm that this is indeed the
case across experiments, we repeat the experiment for 100
runs across different times and locations and measure the
relative power of the two peaks with the highest amplitude
in the multipath proﬁle (i.e., the highest to the second high-
est peak power). We observe that, on average, the strongest
peak has an order of magnitude higher power (speciﬁcally,
27 times higher) as compared to the second strongest peak.
This conﬁrms our hypothesis, that for line-of-sight outdoor
environments, multipath effects are signiﬁcantly weaker than
the line of sight peak and hence, do not interfere with accu-
rate phase based localization.
12.3 Speed Estimation Accuracy
Next, we evaluate Caraoke’s ability to estimate car speed.
For speeds below 40 mile/hour, we ran our experiments on
street A and street D in Figs 10(a) and(b). We used two poles
to localize the car and compute the speed as explained in 7.
We locate the two poles 200 feet apart. Experiments with
speeds higher than 40 mile/hour are performed in an empty
lot. We perform 10 experiments at each speed, for a total of
50 experiments. We compare the speed detected by Caraoke
with the speed reported by the car. Fig. 15 plots the estimated
speed versus the actual speed. The plot shows both the aver-
age and the 90th percentile. The ﬁgure shows that Caraoke’s
estimate of the speed is within 8% of the real value –i.e., the
error is 1 to 4 mile/hour across the whole range of speeds.
12.4 Decoding Accuracy
We evaluate Caraoke’s ability to decode the ids of the
transponders in the presence of wireless collisions. We place
the Caraoke reader on a pole. The reader receives the col-
liding responses and decodes the ids of the transponders.
Speciﬁcally, as described in §8, to decode a particular id,
the reader combines the collisions after compensating for
the channel and CFO of the desired transponder. The reader
keeps combining collisions until the decoded id passes the
checksum test. We use a maximum of 10 transponders whose
owners agreed to the experiment. We run a total of 100 ex-
periments with a different number of colliding transponders
and different distances from the reader.
Fig. 16 shows the time taken to decode a transponder id
for different numbers of colliding transponders. Recall that
when decoding an id, Caraoke reader sends multiple queries,
and combines the resulting collisions to decode. Since the
queries are separated by 1ms, the time axis also shows the
number of combined collisions in order to decode. As can be
seen, the required time increases as the total number of col-
liding transponders increases. This is because when decod-
ing a transponder, other transponders in the collision act as
noise. However, even when there are 10 colliding transpon-
ders, Caraoke can still decode the transponder of interest
within 50ms, on average.
Note that 50ms is also the time to decode all 10 transpon-
ders since one does not need to collect new collisions for
individual transponders. One only needs to compensate for
the CFO and channel of each of the transponders differently.
Since the processing time of each query is negligible in com-
parison to the time it takes to transmit and receive, decoding
all colliding transponders takes as much total time as decod-
ing one transponder.
12.5 Caraoke Reader’s Power Consumption
To proﬁle Caraoke reader for power consumption, we re-
moved the solar panel and the battery and used the USB port
to power the device. We connected the USB to In-line Volt-
age and Current Meter [13], which measures the voltage and
current drawn by the board. The power measurements re-
veal that Caraoke reader consumes 900mW in active mode
and consumes only 69µW in sleep mode.15 Since the solar
panel delivers 500mW in the sun, Caraoke reader would not
be able to run continuously in the active mode. However,
as explained in §10, due to duty cycling, the average power
consumption of the board is much lower as the duration of
the active mode is less than 10ms. Thus, if Caraoke reader
takes one measurement every second, it would consume an
average power of 9mW, which is ∼ 56× lower than what it
can harvest from its solar panel. Hence, the energy harvested
from solar during 3 hours can be stored in a rechargeable
15These numbers exclude the modem module. LTE and Wi-
Fi modems consumes 1-2 W and 100s of mW, respectively,
while transmitting at Mbps data rates. A Caraoke reader
needs to transmit only a few kbits to convey the results of
processing one query (i.e., the channels and CFOs) to a back-
end. Furthermore, it can batch the results of multiple queries
together. Hence, it can use the modem for tens of millisecond
then put it to sleep for a minute or so. By duty cycling the
modem, one can bring down its average power consumption
to mW or hundreds of µW.
308battery and run the device for a week regardless of weather
condition. Finally, note that this operation time can be fur-
ther increased by using a larger solar panel or increasing the
sleep time.
13. CONCLUSION
This paper presents Caraoke a system that can count, lo-
calize, and measure the speed of cars using the RF signal
from their e-toll transponders. Caraoke readers are small,
low-cost and low-power, and hence can be easily deployed
on street lamps to allow cities to deliver smart services, e.g.,
smart parking, trafﬁc monitoring and speed detection, all us-
ing one infrastructure. While we focused mainly on tracking
vehicles, once such infrastructure exists, the city may use it
for additional services, like locating ﬁrst responders, track-
ing the delivery of goods, and enabling people to pay for
mobile services.
