User: I would like to know if there is any Linux distribution where you can easily install and use Python 3. This means a distribution that will provide not only Python 3 binaries and updates but also python modules.
I know that probably we are not going to see any python 3 as the default python interpretor so soon but at least I would like to see latest 2.x as default (2.6+) one and the alternative one already installed.
Probably it is a question between major distributions: Ubuntu, Fedora or Suse?
Assistant: I think most distros have it. Debian has it so all derived distros (Ubuntu et. all) do. Fedora as well. It's just that it's not used for the standard system utilities so just typing python will give you a 2.x interpreter.
