# The Executable Image Exploit

## Overview
This document discusses the "Executable Image Exploit," a technique that allows images to be executed as PHP scripts, enabling various tracking and manipulation capabilities. This exploit was presented at DEFCON XV in Las Vegas, Nevada.

## Code Snippets

### Setting Up the Environment
```php
// Get the referrer URL
$referer = $_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER'];

// Get query strings
$query_string = $_SERVER['QUERY_STRING'];

// Create an image from the handle and send it to the browser
header("Content-type: image/jpeg");

// Write a cookie
setcookie("TestCookie", $value);

// Read a cookie
$old_cookie = $_COOKIE["TestCookie"];

// Output the image
imagejpeg($im);
```

### Configuring Apache
To make Apache execute `.jpg` files as PHP scripts, add the following line to your `.htaccess` file:
```apache
AddType application/x-httpd-php .jpg
```

## Applications

### Web 2.0 Websites
- **Craigslist**
- **eBay**
- **MySpace**
- **Fark**
- **PayPal (payment page)**

### Non-Web Environments
- **Newsgroups (NNTP)**
- **Email**

## Tracking on MySpace
1. **Adding an Inline Executable Image:**
   - Add an inline executable image in a MySpace comment.
   - When a user checks new messages or comments containing the image, the `$_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER']` will contain the user's ID.

2. **Associating Cookies with User Identity:**
   - Use the user ID to associate a cookie with their identity.
   - Example URL: `http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendid=userID`
   - Track the user whenever they revisit the site.

3. **Other MySpace Fun:**
   - **Viewing Habits:** Send messages to friends containing executable images to track their viewing habits.
   - **Different Images for Friends and Non-Friends:** Show different sets of images based on whether the user is a friend or not.
   - **Cross-Domain Tracking:** Use cookies to track users' movements on other sites like eBay and Craigslist.

## Spanning Domains
- **First-Party Cookies:** Cookies set by the domain you are currently visiting.
- **Third-Party Cookies:** Cookies set by a different domain, often used for cross-site tracking.

## Other Web 2.0 Fun
- **Dynamic Images:** Show high-quality images to members and poor-quality images to non-members.
- **Watermarks:** Embed identifying watermarks in images to track unauthorized use.
- **Ebay Auctions:** Change images as the auction nears its end.
- **Ad Targeting:** Show different images in an eBay auction after a user sees a similar ad on Craigslist.
- **Website Evaluation:** Evaluate websites you want to advertise on.
- **Email Acknowledgment:** Receive an acknowledgment when an email is read (non-repudiation).
- **Image Expiration:** Develop images with expiration dates.

## Getting Ideas
- **Focus on Cross-Domain Applications:**
  - Use cookies and referrer variables to catch query strings.
  - Manipulate images easily with PHP and GD.

## Defenses
- **Query Strings:**
  - Be cautious about what data is included in query strings, as session variables can be stolen.
- **Image Uploads:**
  - Allow users to upload images instead of referencing them, which increases server space and bandwidth usage but removes the "executable" aspect from images.
