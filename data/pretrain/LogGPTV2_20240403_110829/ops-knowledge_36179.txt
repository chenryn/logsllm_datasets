User: How to check server hard disk usage and find high-occupied files through the Linux command line?
Assistant: To check the hard disk usage of the server and find the high-occupancy files through the Linux command line, please follow the steps below: 1. Use the df command to check the hard disk usage. The df command can list all mounted file systems and their usage. For example, to view the usage of the /dev/sda1 partition, you can use the following command: ``` $ df -h /dev/sda1 ``` This will display the /dev/sda1 partition's total capacity, usage, free space, Use percentages and mountpoints. 2. Use the du command to find files that take up too much space. The du command can list the disk usage of directories and files. To list the top 10 files in the current directory, you can use the following command: ``` $ du -ah . | sort -hr | head -n 10 ``` This will list all files and subdirectories in the current directory, Sort by size and display the top 10 largest files. 3. Use the find command to find files that take up too much space. The find command can search for qualified files in the specified directory. For example, to find all files in the root directory that are larger than 1GB, you can use the following command: ``` $ sudo find / -type f -size +1G ``` This will search for all files in the root directory that are larger than 1GB in size, and List their full paths. With these commands, you can check your server's hard disk usage and find files that are taking up too much space. Note that the execution of du and find commands may take some time to complete as they need to search the entire filesystem.
