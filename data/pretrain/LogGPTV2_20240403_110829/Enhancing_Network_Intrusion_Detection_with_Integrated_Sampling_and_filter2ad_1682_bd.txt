4.2 Real Traﬃc Data from the Technical University of Vienna
The second data set is based on real network traﬃc from the Technical University
of Vienna [8]. The data set contains a trace of nine days for a class B network.
However, in this experiment we have only included three days worth of data
from one class C network. There were no known security incidents during this
period. The IDS used in this setup is Snort with the same signature set as in the

previous example. The model parameters are also the same as in the previous
example, with the exception that there are no host-based IDSs in this setup.
Results. Figure 6 shows the assessed risk for the entire network for the full
three day period. The two periods of increased risk activity are caused by an
increasing amount of outbound alerts, as seen in Fig. 7 (c). We see that the risk
seems to have a lower bound at a level about 280. This lower bound is the total
risk associated with the stable security state of the individual host HMMs. As
in 4.1, the individual stable state risk for a host is 1.09, and the total stable
state risk for the network is consequently 276.86.
Figure 7 (a), (b), (c), and (d) show the assessed risk for a duration of 3.5 hours,
corresponding to the second period of increased activity in Fig. 6. Fig. 7 (a) shows
the risk activity for the full network, indicating three peaks of increased risk and
some periodic ﬂuctuations. Fig. 7 (b) shows the risk activity for a host with no
alert activity. Fig. 7 (c) shows the risk activity for a host with outbound alerts that
lead to several peaks of maximum risk for the host. Based on the underlying traﬃc
data, it has been determined that these alerts are in fact false alerts from Snort
caused by a speciﬁc user pattern. Finally, Fig. 7 (d) shows the risk activity for a
web server with periodic peaks of risk values between 20 and 40. This is caused
by probing activity directed at the web server. This activity is present during the
entire period, and is a contributing factor to the ﬂuctuations in Fig. 6.

For this data set, 46.35% of the alerts are assigned priority below 20, 49.78%
with priority between 20 and 40, 1.29% with priority between 40 and 60, 0.08%
with priority between 60 and 80, and 2.49% with priority between 80 and 100.
As for the previous example, it is clear that the alert prioritization is successful
in that only a small percentage of the alerts are assigned high priority values.
We see that the approach is applicable to data from real network traﬃc.
However, this example demonstrates that the proposed model is dependent on
the accuracy of the underlying IDSs, and false positives and negatives aﬀect
