User: I have recently switched to VIM using NERDTree and python-mode. As NERDTree seems to have a conflict with python-mode and breaks my layout if I close one out of multiple buffers, I decided to switch to netrw since it is shipped with VIM anyway.
But having a file opened, if I open netrw by typing :E and open another file by hitting <enter> VIM closes the old one and opens the new one in the same window. And if I hit <o> in the same situation VIM adds another buffer but adds a new window in a horizontal split.
How can I add multiple files/buffers to the buffer list and only show the last added buffer in the active window (without new splits) using netrw? #edited#
Thanks in advance! I hope I haven't missed something trivial from the manual.. ;-)

How can I open multiple files/buffers in the same window using netrw?

Buffers are added to a list, the buffer list, and facultatively displayed  in one or more window in one or more tab pages.
Since a window can only display one buffer, the only way to see two separate buffers at the same time is to display them in two separate windows. That's what netrw's o and v allow you to do.
When you use <CR>to edit a file, the previous buffer doesn't go away: it is still in the buffer list and can be accessed with :bp[revious].
