User: I'm on OSX, and I installed IDLE for Python 3.4. However, in Terminal my python -V and pip --version are both Python 2.7. 
How do I fix this? I really have no idea how any of this works, so please bear with my lack of knowledge.
Assistant: Try python3 or python3.4. It should print out the right version if correctly installed.
Python 3.4 already has pip with it. You can use python3 -m pip to access pip. Or python3 -m ensurepip to make sure that it's correctly installed.
