User: You need to monitor running web applications and quickly spot problems with them. Please describe which tools and techniques you will use.
Assistant: would use the following tools and techniques to monitor a running web application: 1. Application Performance Monitoring (APM) tools: These tools help me monitor application performance metrics such as response time, throughput, error rate, etc., and Provides real-time alerts and diagnostic information about the root cause of problems. 2. Log analysis tools: Log files contain information on various aspects of the application, including request and response data, errors, failures, etc. Log analysis tools can search, filter and analyze log data to quickly find problems. 3. User Behavior Analysis Tools: These tools track user interactions with the application in order to identify problems and opportunities in the user experience. 4. Monitoring platform and indicator storage: Use these platforms to centrally store all performance indicators and log data, and provide a visual dashboard to monitor applications in real time. 5. Automated testing tools: Automated testing can simulate various scenarios and loads to find performance and stability issues. 6. Real-time monitoring technology: Real-time monitoring technology can monitor the application process, resource usage and network connection information, and provide instant alerts. 7. System monitoring tool: Use the system monitoring tool to monitor server resource usage, such as CPU, memory, disk and network usage, so as to quickly find bottlenecks and limit problems.
