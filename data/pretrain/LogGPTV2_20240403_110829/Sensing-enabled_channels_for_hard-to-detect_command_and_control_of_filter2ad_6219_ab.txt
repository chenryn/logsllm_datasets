mobile devices in the sports arena. To do so, the attacker issues com-
mand and control messages broadcast via out-of-bound channels.
We outline following types of active context-aware attacks. Vali-
dating the feasibility of some of these attacks is beyond the scope of
this paper, however.
Distributed Denial-of-Service Attacks: The infected mobile de-
vices could be used to launch localized denial-of-service attacks
on a certain network. For example, the infected devices present
in an airport may be “commanded” to collectively bring down the
airport’s WiFi network.
Annoyance Attacks: The malware on the devices could be used to
cause annoyance or even chaos in a public place. E.g., in a movie
theater, an advertisement may be used to send covert triggers to all
infected phones present in the theater; and then the malware on one
phone may interact with other phones (say make phone calls to one
another). The malware may also collectively play some loud music
or sirens. Given that many people do not “silence” their phones in a
theatre, such an attack can certainly cause a lot of annoyance.
Embarrassment Attacks: Selectively triggered malware could be
used to cause embarrassment to the device’s user or those present
nearby. For instance, a person may be using her (infected) phone
to project a presentation in a conference. As the person starts to
speak, another infected phone in the room can trigger the phone
malware (via some out-of-band channel), which would then project
an embarrassing video onto the screen.
Safety Hazards: Public safety hazards are also within the purview
of context-aware malware. As an example, the malware on the
phone can be triggered when the infected phone is inside a driving
car; the malware may then interact with the car’s internal network
and cause some serious problems. Similarly, a malware may get
triggered inside a home/company and may then interfere with the
home’s wireless security system – perhaps dismantle it. This will
clearly prompt the possibility of theft or burglary and may endanger
the lives of the inhabitants.
Interference Attacks: Context-aware malware may be used to
cause interference with the surrounding environment. For example,
the infected mobile devices can selectively interfere with an aircraft
radio system at the time of take-off or landing, or with the medical
devices in a hospital [9, 30].
Distraction Attacks: Another viable and perhaps very interesting
attack would be a “distraction” attack. Here, the malware aboard a
user’s mobile phone tries to distract the user while she is performing
a security task (e.g., reading a security warning; pairing her devices,
etc.). For example, the phone may play a ring tone or vibrate to
distract the user. It would be interesting to see how users fair under
such a distractive attack.
3. OUT-OF-BAND COMMAND AND
CONTROL OVERVIEW
In this section, we provide an overview of different out-of-band
channels using which a botmaster can trigger the infected devices.
A detailed description of these channels and their various character-
istics appears in the following section.
We divide these channels into two categories, one of which ex-
plicitly uses steganographic techniques to make the task of detection
extremely difﬁcult. The receiving side of these channels can be built
using the following sensors on mobile devices:
• Audio sensor / microphone
• Camera / light sensor
• Magnetometer
• Accelerometer / vibration sensor
3.1 Steganographic Channels
A steganographic channel is one where the trigger signal is hid-
den inside another signal. This channel would usually involve the
trigger being embedded inside a song or other audio. Trigger signal
broadcasts using such a channel can be achieved either via audio
signal embedding or live stream embedding, as discussed below.
Audio Signal Embedding: In this variant, the audio signal is em-
bedded inside a recorded carrier audio which is later broadcast using
TV or radio. Here, the attacker does not need to be physically
present near the target. The trigger is embedded in an innocuous
video or audio (e.g., a song or a TV program). When the program is
broadcast through television or radio, any malware infected device
in the physical proximity of a running television or radio will receive
the signal. Other mechanisms, such as embedding the trigger signal
inside music played by musical greeting cards, can also be used to
spread the trigger.
Live Stream Embedding: In this variant, the carrier signal or audio,
containing the trigger signal, is broadcast or played directly near the
target mobile devices. The trigger signal can also be embedded in
broadcast video or audio signals in a different manner. During live
telecast of an event (such as a game or a speech), the attacker can
471play the trigger-embedded audio near the microphone used for the
broadcast. The microphone can pick up the infected audio stream
and thereby broadcast it to a large audience.
The attacker can also tap into the broadcast workplace music de-
livery networks and embed the trigger into the music. For example,
background music services such as Muzak [38] deliver music to
workplaces, hospitals and elevators, which may be leveraged for this
purpose.
3.2 Non-Steganographic Channels
A non-steganographic triggering channel is one where the trigger
signal is not hidden per se, but rather it is delivered directly.
Audio Patterns: The malware can be programmed to be triggered
by a speciﬁc audio pattern (e.g., a song).
Ambient Light: The attacker can tap into the power supply of a
building and cause rapid ﬂuctuations in voltage, resulting in rapid
but imperceptible ﬂickers in the lights all across the building. A
trigger message embedded via such ﬂickers can be read by any
infected phone in the building.
Magnetic Signalling: The attacker can induce a strong enough
magnetic ﬁeld and send the trigger by changing the strength of the
ﬁeld. Using this scheme, the attacker can hide a magnetic ﬁeld
inducing device in a crowded area, as an example, and trigger the
devices whose users pass by the magnet.
Vibrational Signalling: Attackers can also use vibration channels.
For example, messages can be encoded into vibrations produced by
a subwoofer which can be read by nearby phone accelerometers.
4. CHANNEL CHARACTERISTICS
For transmitting command and control messages to mobile de-
vices, we examined the properties of audio, light, magnetic ﬁeld
and vibrational channels overviewed in the previous section. In this
section, we discuss the various properties of each of these chan-
nels including: range, noise characteristics, adversarial control,
coverage and reachability, latency, bandwidth, and steganographic
capabilities. A summary of this analysis is depicted in Table 1.
4.1 Audio Channel
An audio channel is composed of an audio signal, which is used to
encode the trigger message. An audio channel can be steganographic
or non-steganographic, as mentioned before. In the steganographic
mode, the trigger signal is embedded in a song or other music/audio
signal. In the non-steganographic mode, the audio signal is used
directly.
The attacker can use a TV or a radio program, background music
services, an internet TV program and musical greeting cards to
transport its commands over the audio channels. When using a
TV or radio program, the attacker would either need to manipulate
an existing program (such as a popular show or a commercial) or
insert a live audio stream at the recording of a live event (such
as a sporting event). While the former capability may require the
attacker to collude with an insider at the service itself, the latter
capability only requires the attacker to hide a audio transmitter
near the recording station. The attacker may also register its own
commercial with the service within which it can insert the audio
commands. Although this incurs a cost to the attacker, it offers the
advantage of covert communication that can be broadcast to a large
audience, possibly multiple times, in a day. Similarly, when using a
musical service, the attacker would need to tamper with an ongoing
music broadcast. This may again require collusion with an insider
at the music service or hack into the inside network of the service.
In contrast to the traditional TV, radio or musical services, inter-
net TV – especially P2P-TV [4, 5] – appears to be more lucrative
for the attacker. Using such a channel, the attacker can simply
send out its commands embedded within its own program (i.e., for
which the attacker itself is the source of the streaming data). Since
P2P-TV is completely decentralized and any user can become the
source/receiver of a program, the attacker can very easily commu-
nicate with the infected devices through this mechanism. It is also
possible for the attacker to insert its commands within an ongoing
(popular) program as demonstrated in an attack [12] on a popular
Chinese live streaming program called PPLive [4].
All of the above approaches provide broad coverage and reach-
ability. The TV or radio programs can be used to communicate
with all infected devices whose users are tuned to these programs
(assuming that the devices are close to their users). The same applies
to the Internet TV programs; here the users would be watching the
programs on their computers. When using popular programs or live
events in each of these settings, the attacker can ensure that its com-
mands can be delivered to an extremely large number of infected
devices across the globe. In the case of the workplace music setting,
the commands can be received by the infected devices of all users
present in the given building (including visitors). This may cover
an enormous number of devices especially when a big hotel, library,
or an airport, or perhaps many of them, is/are used as the attack
target. With musical greeting cards, the commands can be delivered
to any infected device whose user opens up or plays the cards. The
reachability of this attack clearly depends upon the number of cards
dispatched by the attacker. However, one can imagine a broad cov-
erage especially during peak holiday seasons when users actively
select/test greeting cards (and play them) at local stores. Those
receiving these cards as gifts from others are also reachable because
they will also be playing the music.
The sensitivity of mobile device microphones can also impact
sound reception. Mobile phone microphone are reasonably sensitive
(as discussed in Section 2.1), but most mobile operating systems
perform noise cancellation of some form at the driver level. Hence,
the audio received by a mobile phone may sometimes be not exactly
the same frequency as the original sound. The audio channel can also
be distorted if the target mobile device is inside pockets or purses.
Another important measure of the effectiveness of command and
control channels is their latency, i.e., the delay incurred in delivering
the messages to infected devices. All of our settings introduce little
latency and the delivery of messages can take place as soon as the
users tune to the given program, or are present in a given building.
Thus, the delay is only up to the broadcast of the program. With
greeting cards, the delay is up to the point users open up and play
the cards.
When looking at the audio channel properties themselves, the
range and distortion might be two limiting factors. An audio channel
must use audio signals that are strong enough to traverse the distance
between the trigger transmitter and the mobile device. In addition,
background noise often tends to drown the source audio signal.
Luckily, in our attack setups, the desired communication range is
short, less than a few feet at most. The Internet TV set-up is again
the most promising in terms of the range since users’ devices are
expected to be only a few inches, or about a feet, away from their
computers playing the program. Greeting cards also require similar
ranges. TV programs, on the other hand, will usually require a
communication range of several feet, given that the ideal TV viewing
distance is several feet (depending upon the size of the TV screen)
[6]. This, however, will be compensated by the powerful speakers
of modern TV sets or their associated home theatre systems.
472Table 1: Comparison of different out-of-band channels for command and control
Furthermore, audio noise is fairly common and can complicate the
task of audio decoding. Noise is quite common in public places.
The bandwidth of the command and control channel may also be
important in some scenarios, especially if malware payloads or new
malware programs are to be disseminated to the infected devices.
The use of out-of-band channels in general, however, exhibits low
bandwidths due their fundamental physical characteristics. The au-
dio channel bandwidths are expected to be limited to only a few bits
per second [32]. This is an obvious trade-off in using out-of-band
command and control in contrast to the traditional channels – the
former provide better undetectability while the latter possess better
bandwidths. However, even with low bandwidth, the envisioned
audio channels can deﬁnitely be used to rapidly send triggers to a
large number of devices. In addition, to transmit larger messages
or other data, the audio signalling could be spanned over the entire
program (such as a game or a movie), or multiple programs, or
multiple occurrences of the same program.
4.2 Light Channel
The light channel uses the ambient light sensors present in most
smart phones and many laptops/tablets. These sensors are very sensi-
tive to the ambient light. The intensity of most light sources depend
on the voltage of the power supply. Thus, by changing the voltage,
it is possible to modify the ambient light in an indoor location. An
attacker using a light channel to broadcast the messages can tap
into the power supply of the building and introduce ﬂuctuations,
by modifying the voltage or by introducing very short ﬂickers. All
rooms in the building will be affected under such an attack. Getting
access to the power supply of a building can be a formidable obsta-
cle for the adversary, although such attacks have previously been
reported in the wild [36]. However, the payoff in this case is higher:
by tapping into a single place, the adversary can cover all areas of a
building. Another possibility is to embed the messages within the
light variations into an existing or attacker chosen TV program or
commercial, similar to some of the audio-based approaches.
Similar to audio channels, light channels also open up the possibil-
ity of a broad coverage. When using a TV broadcast, messages can

the phones are near their users and not stowed inside pockets/purses).
This is especially true when large screen TV sets are used such as in
a pub or night club.
These channels also incur minor latencies. These are limited to
the point the TV broadcast is screened or the lights are ﬂickered in
the building. In terms of undetectability, the ﬂickering of the lights
can be so quick that they are not perceptible by the humans present
in the surroundings. The TV broadcast can be explicitly made
steganographic similar in spirit to the audio based stego broadcast.
As far as the range of the light channel is concerned, several
feet is easily workable. This clearly covers the indoor environment
such as the scenario of watching a TV screen and ﬂuctuating lights
mounted on low ceilings.
The light channel, however, exhibits some limitations. First, to be
able to receive a message via the light channel, the mobile device’s
light sensor must be unobstructed. If the mobile phone is kept inside
a pocket or purse, the light channel can not be used. However, many
computing devices other than mobile phones – such as tablets or
laptops – also contain cameras or light sensors that can be used to
measure the intensity of ambient light. The light channel can be
effectively used on such devices as they are not usually stowed when
powered on.
Another challenge with the light channel is the presence of noise.
Ambient light sensors usually do not distinguish between light from
different sources as long as it falls inside the visible light spectrum.
Therefore, the noise in a light channel can be quite high if there
are other frequently changing light sources (e.g., multiple TV sets
displaying different programs in a pub) in the same indoor space.
In contrast to the audio channel, however, the likelihood of the
presence of visual background noise is much less, and thus the light
channel is expected to be more robust in practice.
The light channel is expected to provide similar levels of bit rates
to that of the audio channel for data transmission.
4.3 Magnetic Channel
