## Abstract
The evolving cyber-threat landscape highlights that no system is entirely immune to attacks. Quantifying risk and developing predictive methods are crucial for taking proactive measures to mitigate the impact of cyber incidents. We introduce RiskTeller, a system that analyzes binary file appearance logs from machines to predict potential infections months in advance. RiskTeller builds comprehensive profiles for each machine, capturing usage patterns, and associates these profiles with risk levels using both fully and semi-supervised learning techniques. We evaluated RiskTeller on a year-long dataset encompassing binary file appearances on 18 enterprises' machines. Our results demonstrate that RiskTeller can predict subsequent infections with the highest precision achieved to date.

## 1. Introduction
Over the past two decades, the cyber-threat ecosystem has undergone significant changes. Attackers now employ sophisticated tools and techniques, while the stakes for organizations continue to rise. Experian reports that nearly half of business organizations experience at least one security incident annually [8]. Despite efforts to develop and defend secure systems, few in the industry, especially in large organizations, can feel confident about their infrastructure's invulnerability. IT administrators are increasingly focused on understanding when and how malicious actions will occur, rather than if they will happen.

Given the inevitability of malware infections, predicting risk becomes essential. Identifying the most vulnerable parts of a system allows for proactive measures, such as hardening those areas. Additionally, accurate risk prediction is fundamental for the growing field of cyber-insurance [27], which helps organizations and individuals mitigate the costs of potentially devastating attacks. An efficient cyber-insurance market relies on effective methods for estimating and predicting risk.

To date, the research community has extensively studied various aspects of malware, primarily focusing on analysis, detection, and prevention. However, only a few works have presented prediction models [4, 16, 19, 30, 37, 38] that enable proactive measures. These studies analyzed user demographics, network behavior, web browsing, website features, network mismanagement, and historical incident reports. In contrast, we use a dataset that provides detailed information about the security posture of each enterprise machine, achieving higher prediction accuracy.

We present RiskTeller, a system that analyzes per-machine file appearance logs to predict which machines are at risk of malware infection. The data is collected from 600,000 machines across 18 enterprises, resulting in a total of 4.4 billion binary file appearance events, the largest dataset used for risk prediction to date. For each machine, we generate a profile with 89 features, including event volume, temporal patterns, application categories, file rarity, patching behavior, and threat history. These features provide a comprehensive overview of each machine's usage patterns and user security awareness.

Our ground truth is based on observing malicious files and infection records according to endpoint protection software. We built it carefully to avoid mislabeling. While an ideal ground truth is nearly impossible due to the arms race with cyber attackers, our ground truth leverages a large set of labeled files (over 1 billion), ensuring reliable results. To address potential ground truth limitations, we developed a semi-supervised algorithm that attributes fuzzy labels to unknown profiles based on their similarity to labeled ones, enriching the ground truth when it is imbalanced or limited.

In summary, our paper makes the following contributions:
1. We propose RiskTeller, a system that uses both supervised and semi-supervised learning to predict machine infection risk with the highest accuracy achieved to date.
2. We design 89 features extracted from per-machine file appearance logs to create machine profiles, capturing usage patterns and user security awareness.
3. We develop a semi-supervised machine learning algorithm that infers fuzzy labels for unlabeled machines based on similar labeled machines, enhancing the ground truth.
4. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation demonstrating that RiskTeller can predict infected machines with high precision, highlighting the importance of the feature extraction and semi-supervised learning steps.

## 2. Why Cyber Risk Prediction?
For over a decade, the security community has warned about the imminent "cyber crime era." The constant stream of cybersecurity incidents, often featured in mainstream media, confirms that this era has arrived. Facing cyber attacks is now the norm, making proactive defenses necessary. Businesses need to minimize damage when attacks occur by deploying multiple layers of security, including managed services, trusted advisors, and employee training programs. Given the high costs, businesses must prioritize, and predicting which entities are more likely to be attacked is crucial for prioritization. For example, high-risk employees could receive special security training to avoid opening malicious email attachments.

Recently, security companies have incorporated cyber insurance into their multi-layered approach to ease recovery after attacks. The growing demand for cyber insurance has led to increased competition among insurance companies to accurately assess and predict risk. Typically, risk assessment for cyber insurance uses underwriting tools that rely on questionnaires or publicly available data, limiting the accuracy of the assessment. Insurance companies seek better risk prediction methodologies that leverage internal security telemetry. In our work, we analyze internal telemetry to predict which computers are most at risk, achieving high prediction accuracy through the profiles we build for each computer.

Predicting future events is more challenging than detecting current malicious activities. Detection aims to maximize true positives while minimizing false positives, as false positives can be costly (e.g., blocking essential software). In contrast, prediction aims to identify all potentially infected machines, even if it means more false positives, as the cost of false positives is lower. Previous prediction works have produced more than 20% false positives to correctly predict over 95% of incidents [19], which is acceptable for insurance companies. However, market competition demands lower false positives, and our work aims to meet this expectation.

## 3. Dataset
Our work is based on large-scale data mining, which reveals behavioral differences between clean and potentially infected machines. The primary dataset consists of reports on new binary file appearances, generated by enterprise customers of a large antivirus company who opted to share their data. This data is anonymized to protect customer identities. The binary file appearance logs are collected from over 100,000 enterprises, with around 100 million file appearances reported daily. We obtained a subset covering 4.4 billion binary appearance logs from 600,000 machines across 18 enterprises, sufficient to model file appearance patterns and predict cyber threats several months in advance.

The key fields in the binary file appearance logs include:
- (Anonymized) enterprise and machine identifiers
- SHA2 file hash
- File name and directory
- File version
- Timestamps for the first file appearance and reporting
- File signer subject in the certificate

### 3.1 Data Preprocessing
To extract value from the data, we perform normalization and cleaning. We normalize file and directory names to identify similar functions, remove version numbers using regular expressions, and eliminate suffixes typically appended to duplicate files. Since the dataset does not specify which applications binary files belong to, we infer this information from directory names. In Windows systems, applications use CSIDL (Constant Special Item Id List) to identify special folders. We use depth-3 paths starting from the CSIDL_PROGRAM_FILES directory to identify applications.

### 3.2 Ground Truth
We split our dataset into two periods: a feature extraction period and a labeling period. The classifier uses features from the feature extraction period to predict labels based on events in the labeling period. We build our ground truth using three datasets:
1. A labeled dataset from the AV company, consisting of 16 million known benign and 214 million known malware file hashes, continuously updated.
2. A dataset of file hashes identified as malware by the AV product, never manually exonerated, containing 800 million hashes.
3. A dataset of malware infections detected through network activity, obtained from the IPS product telemetry.

We define "clean" machines as those with very few unknown files, no known malware, and no infection records. "Risky" machines have multiple known malware files and/or infection records during the labeling period.
