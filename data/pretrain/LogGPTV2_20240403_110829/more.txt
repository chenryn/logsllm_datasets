#### Examples
1. **View the first screen of information from a file named `Clients.new`**:
   ```sh
   more < clients.new
   type clients.new | more
   ```
   The `more` command displays the first screen of information from `Clients.new`, and you can press the SPACEBAR to see the next screen of information.

2. **Clear the screen and remove all extra blank lines before displaying the file `Clients.new`**:
   ```sh
   more /c /s < clients.new
   type clients.new | more /c /s
   ```

3. **Display the current line number at the `more` prompt**:
   ```sh
   more =

   The current line number is added to the `more` prompt, as `-- More [Line: 24] --`.
