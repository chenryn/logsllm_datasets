mented graph in the LP2 model.
Why is it that high-degree destinations do not require pro-
tection from S*BGP in the LP2 model? Consider a source
AS s that has a long (> 2 hop) customer route and short
(≤ 2 hop) peer route to the destination d. In LP2, s will
chose the short peer route, so an attacker m that wishes to
attract traﬃc from s must be exactly one hop away from
s (so that he can announce the bogus two-hop path “m, d”
directly to s, that s will prefer if m is his customer, or if
m is a peer that is preferred according to his tiebreak rule).
When m is not one hop away from s, s is immune. Since m
is unlikely to be exactly one-hop away from every source AS
that prefers a short peer route in LP2 over a long customer
route that it would have used in our original routing pol-
icy model, we see more immune nodes on average in LP2.
This eﬀect is stronger on the IXP-augmented graph because

it contains more peering edges, and therefore more short
peering routes.
2. While in Section 4.6 we found that most ASes that wish
to reach Tier 1 destinations are doomed, this is no longer
the case in the LP2 model; while the Tier 1 destinations
still do not have quite as many immune ASes as the Tier 2s
do, the vast majority of source ASes that wish to reach Tier
1 destinations are immune when security is 3rd.
What is the reason for this? Consider the security 2nd
model. Many of the protocol downgrades we saw with the
original LP model resulted from a source AS s preferring
(possibly-long) bogus customer path to the attacker m, over
(possibly-short) peer or provider routes to the legitimate
destination (e.g., Figure 2). However, in the LP2 policy
variant, s will only prefer a bogus customer path only if
s has no shorter (≤ 2 hop) peer or customer route to the
legitimate destinations; when s has such route, we consider
s to be immune (cf., Section 4.3.1). For example, while

when security is 2nd, with the LP2 variant and security 2nd
AS 147 is now immune, because it has a one-hop peer route
to the legitimate Tier 1 destination!
Our results indicate that this situation is common. Com-
paring Figure 25 with Figure 4-5, suggests that during at-
tacks on Tier 1, 2, and CP destinations, there are many ASes
that have short (≤ 2 hop) peer routes to the legitimate des-
tination d, and are therefore choosing those routes instead
of long bogus customer routes to the attacker m. Moreover,
in the IXP-augmented graph, that are many more (≈ 4X)
peering edges than in the UCLA graph, which accounts for
the increased number of immune nodes we saw for the secu-
rity 2nd model in Figure 24.
While this is good news for the Tier 1s, we point out that
in the LP2 model this is little need for S*BGP to protect
the Tier 1, 2, 3 and CP destinations, since most source ASes
that wish to reach these destinations (i.e., > 80%) are happy
in the baseline scenario already!
