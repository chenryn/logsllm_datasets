banking, or social media.” Then, respondents were presented with
one of six password-reuse notifications (Section 3.2).
Three sets of questions followed. The first set measured respon-
dents’ overall understanding of the notification by asking what may
have caused it to be sent through two open-ended questions: “In
your own words, please describe what this notification is telling
you” and “In your own words, please describe all factors that may
have caused you to receive this notification.” The second set asked
respondents to list three feelings they might have and three ac-
tions they might take upon receiving the notification, and why. The
third set presented seven statements, in randomized order, about
perceptions of the effectiveness of the notification’s explanation
of the situation, its delivery method, and its apparent legitimacy.
Respondents gave a Likert-scale response and free-text justification
for each. Finally, respondents reported the following demographic
information: gender, age, highest degree attained, and technical
expertise. Appendix A.1 contains the full text of the survey.
3.2 Conditions
In Study 1 we evaluated six real notifications used by online account
providers. To collect such notifications, four members of the re-
search team searched for notifications sent by major online account
providers after known data breaches that had been posted online or
on social media. We deemed a notification in scope if the potential
risk may have originated from password reuse. We verified all noti-
fications as legitimate (not phishing) by cross-referencing Twitter
accounts, company security blogs, and news articles.
We collected 24 real notifications about password reuse. To se-
lect a set of representative notifications, we used affinity diagram-
ming [28] to categorize and group similar notifications. Three mem-
bers of the research team created separate affinity diagrams for
major types of variation in notifications. We uncovered stark differ-
ences in the degree to which a cause was explained, what actions
were required or suggested, and how the notification was delivered.
From the 24 notifications, we selected six that captured the range
of variation within and across these three dimensions. Table 1 sum-
marizes the notifications, which we refer to with the name of the
provider who originally sent that notification. To avoid priming
were treated as categorical; we selected the most prevalent cate-
gorical value as the baseline. We chose the LinkedIn notification
as the baseline category for the notification term as it was most
representative (as determined through affinity diagramming) of the
24 messages we originally collected.
In particular, we built parsimonious regression models using
stepwise backward-elimination, minimizing AIC. All of these parsi-
monious final models contained the notification term. To determine
whether this notification term was significant, we compared these
final models to their analogous null models (removing the notifica-
tion term) to calculate an omnibus p-value, which we report as the
regression p-value. Furthermore, we report significant individual
factors in the regression by providing that factor’s log-adjusted
regression coefficient (e.g., odds ratio, denoted OR) and p-value.
Our accompanying technical report1 contains the full regression
tables. If this omnibus test was significant, we performed pairwise
comparisons between notifications using the Mann-Whitney U
test, for which we report the test statistic (U ) and the p-value. We
set α = .05 for all tests and used the Holm method to correct for
multiple testing within a family of tests.
Finally, we analyzed responses to open-answer survey questions
via qualitative coding. A member of the research team read the
responses and performed a thematic analysis, iteratively updating
the codebook as necessary. The researcher then used axial coding
for consolidation and clarification, resulting in 11 themes for the
causes of receiving the presented notification. To focus on recurring
themes, we report codes that occurred for at least 10 % of responses.
We also performed a thematic analysis of respondents’ free-text
explanations in the third set of questions to more fully understand
why respondents answered the questions the way they did. This
process was largely the same as the one for the first section of
questions, resulting in four or more codes for each question.
In addition, respondents provided in free text three feelings and
three intended actions in response to the notification. We cleaned
responses to condense tenses differences and misspellings. As the
survey asked for these in any order, responses were not ranked
during analysis. We used the NRC Word-Emotion Association Lexi-
con [42] to group feelings as positive, neutral, or negative.
4 STUDY 1 RESULTS
In Study 1, we found that the current password-reuse notifications
we tested elicit worry and fear. While the notifications do motivate
some respondents to report intending to change their passwords,
respondents do not report intending to change their passwords
in sufficiently security-enhancing ways. For example, many re-
spondents report planning to make small adjustments to existing
passwords, which will likely leave them susceptible to password-
reuse attacks. This lack of sufficient action may be attributed in
part to notification confusion. A majority of respondents report
not understanding the notification, and their mental model may,
therefore, be insufficient to elicit an appropriate response.
4.1 Respondents
180 people responded to our survey. Their ages ranged from 18 to
74 years, though most respondents were between 25 and 34 years

respondents with biases they might have about the companies that
originally sent these notifications, as well as to minimize potential
confounds from the visual layout of the notification, we visually
rebranded all notifications to be from a hypothetical online ac-
count provider “AcmeCo.” Figure 1 depicts the rebranded LinkedIn
notification. The five other notifications are in Appendix B.1.
Prior to launching the study, we conducted cognitive interviews
to refine the survey wording iteratively and verify the intelligibility
of questions. A limitation of survey studies is that responses can
suffer from self-report and social desirability biases that may affect
accuracy. Respondents’ reported reactions may differ from their
reactions had they received the notification in real life. In line
with survey best practices, we worked to minimize relevant biases
through the aforementioned pre-testing and by using softening
language to minimize social-desirability bias [36]. Despite potential
biases, related work has shown that while survey responses to
security messages may be biased, they correlate strongly with real-
world reactions [50]. Our results should thus be interpreted as
trends of user behavior rather than precise frequency estimates.
3.3 Analysis Methods and Metrics
We collected both quantitative and qualitative data. Our quantita-
tive analysis centered on the seven statements to which participants
responded on scales (four on Likert scales and three on other scales),
which we treated as ordinal. To evaluate whether responses differed
significantly across notifications while controlling for the effects of
demographic factors, we built ordinal logistic regression models.
In each model, the dependent variable was the set of Likert-scale
responses to a given statement. We used the following independent
variables: the notification the respondent saw; the respondent’s age;
the respondent’s gender; the respondent’s level of education; and
the respondent’s technical background. All independent variables
sizable minority was unsure (16.7 %). These “unsure” respondents
wanted to get more information from AcmeCo, which shows the
importance of clear communication of the situation at hand in a
password-reuse notification. Finally, a few respondents were dis-
missive of any consequences: “Acme has so many accounts that the
chances that my account is hacked are pretty slim” (R81).
Facebook, Google email notifications high-priority. Across
notifications, responses about the priority of taking action differed
significantly (regression p = .012). Compared to the LinkedIn noti-
fication, a significantly larger fraction of respondents reported that
taking action in response to the Facebook (OR = 4.3, p = 0.003)
and Google email (OR = 3.0, p = 0.022) notifications would be a
high priority. Significantly more respondents reported the same
for the Facebook notification relative to the Instagram notification
(U = 633.0, p = 0.044). 100 % of respondents who received the
Facebook notification, 93.5 % of those who received the Google
email notification, 80.6 % of those who received the LinkedIn notifi-
cation, and 71.0 % of those who received the Instagram notification
reported that taking action in response to their respective noti-
fications would be a high priority. We hypothesize respondents
perceived the Facebook and Google email notifications to a be
higher priority because the Facebook notification prohibited users
from logging in, and Google’s email included a prominent red color.
Nearly all respondents indicated that taking action in re-
sponse to the notification was a priority. Across all notifica-
tions, 95.6 % of respondents indicated that taking action in response
to receiving the notification would be either a very high, high, or
a medium priority. In their free-response justifications, 76.6 % of
respondents explained that they wanted to protect their personal
information or prevent unauthorized account access. 29.4 % of re-
sponses specified that the high priority was due to a lack of time:
“The quicker I act, the safer my account will be” (R54).
4.3 Understanding of the Notification
Few respondents recognized the notification’s real cause. We
asked respondents to describe all factors that may have caused them
to receive that notification. Most respondents believed that the
notification was sent because of circumstances beyond their control.
R171 was typical in failing to account for password-reuse attacks
as a cause, stating, “The chances of someone guessing that I use the
same password are still incredibly low. Still, I would be worried that
the password might be too common.” 60 % of respondents attributed
the notification to someone hacking their account or unsuccessfully
attempting to log in. While this makes sense, as some notifications
convey that someone may have tried to log in to their account, this
is not the full truth: the login may have been attempted as part of a
password-reuse attack. Further, 21.1% of respondents believed that
it may have been sent in error, as a false alarm due to the real user
of the account using a new device, signing in from a new location,
or entering the incorrect password too many times. A minority
mentioned the potential real cause of the notification: either a data
breach (20.6 %) or password reuse by the account holder (18.8 %).
4.4 Intended Response to Notification
Most respondents do not intend to change their password.
While most respondents agreed that taking action was a priority,

old. 44.4 % of our respondents were female, and a majority (62.8 %) of
respondents had a two-year or higher degree. 70.6 % of respondents
reported no experience (education or job) in a technical field.
4.2 Notification Response
Figure 3 highlights respondents’ reactions to the notifications.
Notifications elicited negative responses. Of the 540 feelings
reported by respondents, worried, afraid, and anxious were the main
responses to receiving a password-reuse notification. Figure 2 dis-
plays feelings reported by ten or more respondents. Fortunately,
some positive feelings, such as safe or relieved, were also common.
As the notifications are communicating potential risks to accounts,
it makes sense that an overall negative sentiment dominated. How-
ever, a password-reuse notification should induce more positive
responses, as they are ultimately helping their users.
Notifications were concerning. Across notifications, most re-
spondents (66.7 %) reported that they would feel extremely or mod-
erately concerned upon receiving the notification. R56 explained,
“The potential for losing an account and sensitive information is
something to be concerned about. Anyone who wouldn’t feel con-
cerned is either ignorant or lying.” Only 3.3 % reported no concern.
Respondents’ reported concern differed significantly across noti-
fications (regression p = 0.003). Respondents found the Facebook
(OR = 3.3, p = 0.011) and the Google email notifications (OR = 4.1,
p = 0.003) more concerning than the LinkedIn notification, the con-
trol in our regression. Respondents also reported a greater concern
about receiving the Facebook notification (U = 674.5, p = 0.019)
and the Google email notification (U = 730.5, p = 0.011) than the
Instagram notification. 89.7 % reported the Facebook notification as
concerning, 83.9 % reported the Google email notification as con-
cerning, 54.9 % reported the LinkedIn notification as concerning,
and 53.1 % reported the Instagram notification as concerning.
Ignoring the notifications would have consequences. Most
respondents disagreed or strongly disagreed that ignoring the
notification they received would not have consequences (77.1 %).
Responses differed significantly across notifications (regression
p = .045). Respondents noted potential consequences that included
harm to their account “because hackers could steal my info” (R150),
as well as “being locked out of my accounts” (R84). However, a

Respondents also reported their
agreement of whether the notification was sent via the appropriate method, could be ignored without consequence, would be
sent by real companies, and explained how to resolve the situation. Finally, respondents reported the level of concern they
would expect to have upon receiving the notification, and whether they had received such notifications before.
they disagreed on what to do and volunteered a wide variety of
examples. Respondents wrote that they would take actions such as
changing their password (29.3 % of respondents), investigating the
situation (18.6 %), and logging into their account (15.4 %) in response
to receiving the notification. While the self-reported intention to
change their password was the most common, it is nevertheless
extremely low as an absolute percentage. This is a cause for concern,
as securing an account through password changes should be a
priority for all users in situations of password reuse.
Overall, respondents found the notifications informative.
A majority of respondents (62.8 %) either agreed or strongly agreed
that the notification they received explained how to resolve the
situation by giving specific, clear instructions (58.3 %). However,
26.7 % believed it did not do so, and 10.0 % of respondents indicated
that resolving the situation would require more background infor-
mation. As R137 explained, “I need more information as to what
happened before I just blindly change my password.”
Notifications with prominent explanations perceived as
most informative. We observed significant differences across no-
tifications in respondents’ perceptions of whether the notification
explained how to resolve the situation (regression p < 0.001). The
agreement that the notification explained the situation differed
starkly across notifications: LinkedIn (80.6 % of respondents agreed
or strongly agreed), Facebook (75.9 %), Netflix (75.0 %), Instagram
(68.7 %), Google email (54.9 %), and Google red bar (21.6 %). Agree-
ment was higher for the LinkedIn notification than for the Google
email (OR = 0.2, p < 0.001) and the Google red bar (OR = .03,
p < 0.001) notifications. Compared to the Google red bar notifi-
cation, agreement was also significantly higher for the Facebook
(U = 646.5, p < 0.001), Google email (U = 642, p = 0.011), Insta-
gram (U = 177.5, p < 0.001), and Netflix (U = 131.0, p < 0.001)
notifications. The low reported percentages for the Google email
and Google red bar notifications make sense because both notifi-
cations had a link that had to be clicked for more information and
explanation. The other notifications had more detail and instruc-
tions in the notification itself.
4.5 Reactions to Structure and Delivery
Most respondents agreed that the notification they received used the
appropriate method of contacting them (65.0 %), primarily because
it was easy, convenient, or fast (58.3 % of respondents). However,
some respondents would have preferred a more immediate method
(17.8 %) or multiple methods (11.6 %). Agreement about the method’s
appropriateness differed across notifications (regression p < .001).
Email perceived as the most legitimate delivery method.
The Google email, LinkedIn, and Netflix notifications, all sent by
email, were reported to be delivered with the most appropriate
method and to seem the most legitimate. This is perhaps due to
some respondents’ justification that email is official (10 %), and that
they may have seen similar email notifications in the past. Respon-
dents were more likely to report that the LinkedIn notification was
appropriate than the Facebook (OR = 0.2, p < 0.001), Google red
bar (OR = 0.1, p < 0.001), and Instagram (OR = 0.3, p < 0.010) no-
tifications. For the LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook, and Google red
bar notifications, respectively, 98.6 %, 62.5 %, 51.7 %, and 48.2 % of
respondents reported agreement that the notification they received
was delivered with the appropriate method. Fewer respondents
found the Facebook notification appropriate than the Google email
notification (U = 265, p = 0.049).
Respondents’ expectations regarding real companies sending the
notification also differed across conditions (regression p = .012).
While 96.7 % of respondents who saw the LinkedIn notification re-
ported expecting real companies would send it, only 67.7 % reported
the same for the Instagram notification (OR = 0.2, p = 0.003).
Our notifications were relevant to real situations. Overall,
most respondents agreed (86.7 %) that they would expect real com-
panies to send notifications like these when necessary. Respondents
reported receiving notifications similar to this one in the past: 52.1 %
