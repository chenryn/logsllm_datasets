User: What is the process of automating the provisioning of a group of servers using Ansible playbooks?
Assistant: The process of using Ansible playbooks to automatically configure a group of servers can be divided into the following steps: 1. Determine the configuration tasks and target servers to be performed: determine the tasks that need to be configured, such as installing software packages, creating users, modifying system configuration, etc., and determine the required The target server for configuration. 2. Write Ansible playbook: use YAML format to write Ansible playbook file, define required tasks, server list and variables, etc. 3. Execute the Ansible playbook: use the ansible-playbook command to execute the Ansible playbook, and Ansible will automatically connect to the target server and perform the required tasks. 4. Check the configuration results: After the execution is complete, check whether the configuration of each server meets expectations. 5. Adjustment and optimization: Adjust and optimize the Ansible playbook as needed to better meet the needs.
