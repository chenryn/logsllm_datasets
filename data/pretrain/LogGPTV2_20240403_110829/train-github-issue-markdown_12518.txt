### Environment
  * Dubbo version: master
  * Operating System version: deepin 15.9
  * Java version: 8
I want to know more about dubbo.And I found this code in module dubbo-
metrics/dubbo-metrics-api/.../MetrcLevel
    static {
            for (MetricLevel level : MetricLevel.values()) {
                if (level.ordinal() < 0) {
                    throw new RuntimeException("MetricLevel can not < 0");
                }
            }
        }
I think this code is futility.Is it possible of level.ordinal() < 0?
