### Issue Description
On iOS Safari, the pop-over does not automatically dismiss when the user scrolls, which alters the intended behavior. Ideally, the pop-over should be removed before scrolling is allowed.

### Expected Behavior
The pop-over should be dismissed before the user is able to scroll.

### Actual Behavior
When a user scrolls on iOS Safari while the pop-over is visible, the pop-over remains on the screen and does not disappear.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Open any demo application that includes a pop-over feature.
2. Trigger the pop-over to appear.
3. Attempt to scroll while the pop-over is visible.
4. Observe that the pop-over does not dismiss and scrolling is still possible.

### Additional Notes
- This issue can be verified using the demo page of any app with a pop-over feature.
