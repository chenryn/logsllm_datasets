### Black Ops 2007: Design Reviewing the Web
**Speaker:** Dan Kaminsky  
**Title:** Director of Penetration Testing, IOActive Inc.

#### Three Interesting Topics
1. **Slirpie:** Turn your website into a virtual private network (VPN).
2. **P0wf:** Automatically discover the toolkits behind web applications.
3. **LudiVu:** A visually appealing project (details not provided).

#### Introduction to Slirpie: Dependence and Independence
- **Fundamental Design of the Web:**
  - The web is designed with late binding, where components are assembled at runtime independently.
  - Once independence was established, users began to create dependencies, such as reading your mail while you read their page.
  - This can be problematic from a security perspective.

- **Same Origin Policy:**
  - Independent resources (e.g., images, self-contained iframes) can load across different security domains.
  - Dependent resources (e.g., scripts) can only interact if they are hosted from the same origin.
  - Example: A page can read from an iframe it provides, but not from an iframe provided by another domain like Hotmail.

- **The Obvious Bug:**
  - Content does not come from names; it comes from addresses.
  - DNS provides the name-to-address mapping, which was assumed to remain static.
  - However, this assumption is incorrect, leading to potential vulnerabilities.

- **DNS Pinning:**
  - DNS Rebinding, where the DNS address is swapped, has been known for years.
  - Browsers have implemented DNS Pinning to lock the browser to a specific address.
  - Recent research by RSnake and Dan Boneh from Stanford has shown that this defense is not foolproof.

- **New Era of DNS Rebinding Attacks:**
  - Browsers attempt to pin DNS but fail open rather than closed, making them more reliable.
  - Plugins, which can make their own connections, do not share the pin cache with the browser, allowing them to load applets from one address and deliver traffic to another.

- **Plug and Play:**
  - RSnake and Dan Boneh's team found that:
    - The browser itself can provide arbitrary HTTP.
    - XMLHTTPRequest offers "crippled TCP."
    - Flash9 provides arbitrary TCP sockets.
    - Java provides arbitrary TCP and UDP sockets.
  - These capabilities should be bound to the site providing the applet, but this binding often fails.

- **Significance of the Attack:**
  - Some people underestimate the severity of these attacks.
  - Demonstrating the problem is crucial for understanding its impact.
  - Fixing these issues will require collaboration among many parties, making a demonstration essential.

#### Slirpie: The Browser VPN Concentrator
- **Design Overview:**
  - Applications generate data streams, which are sent to sockets.
  - Sockets are consumed by RAS and turned into packets.
  - Packets are processed by poptop (a PPTP daemon) and given to SLIRP, which converts them back into streams.
  - Streams are then consumed by slirpie (a web server) and sent to any major browser, which builds a page with Ajax, called a "bucket," to create socket providers (suckets) that send the data.

- **History:**
  - **1996: Slirp Popularity**
    - Slirp converted shell accounts to PPP accounts.
    - It acted as a "Userspace NAT," converting packets into streams for sockets.
    - This was less resource-intensive for ISPs compared to running apps locally.
  - **2001: PPTP over SSH**
    - PoPToP, the Linux PPTP server, used an external PPP provider.
    - Slirp could serve as this provider, and Slirp over SSH could also be a provider.

- **Six Years Later:**
  - Slirp transformed packets into streams, and then into sockets.
  - Slirpie takes these streams and hands them to something else entirely.

- **Slirpie Design:**
  - Slirpie maintains a list of streams waiting to be completed in a remote browser.
  - When a browser arrives, it receives an AJAX page ("Bucket") that requests a list of all unique IP addresses to which packets need to be delivered.

- **The DNS Two-Step:**
  - Traffic cannot be spawned directly to these IP addresses; it must always come to our name.
  - Multiple subdomains can be used to encode the desired address in the name.
  - For each IP address, register intent to create a sucket, then create iframes to a.b.c.d.notmallory.com, where a.b.c.d represents the IPv4 quad.
  - This registration ensures that DNS for notmallory.com returns the real address only once.

- **Duke Suckets:**
  - Each IFrame contains an applet that, upon spawning, requests a list of ports and protocols to create connections.
  - This allows the applet to use the browser's pin cache when needed.
  - For each successful connection, the applet starts proxying traffic between the connection and slirpie using standard HTTP tunnel mechanics.
  - One sucket can service multiple sockets, and suckets should be destroyed when no longer needed to maintain efficiency.

#### Other Tricks
- **P0wf: Passive OS Web Fingerprinting**
  - Based on p0f, a Passive OS Fingerprinter by Zalewski.
  - Most websites use template engines, which provide more uniquely recognizable elements than traditional stack-based fingerprinting.
  - HTML is far more varied and complex than TCP/IP, making it easier to fingerprint.

- **Fingerprintable Elements in HTML:**
  - **Obvious Choices:**
    - Filenames (especially included scripts)
    - Cookie formats
    - URL formats
    - RPC formats (for AJAX)
    - Function names
  - **Less Obvious Choices:**
    - Script and HTML formatting
    - Comment content
    - Validation failures
    - Prominent errors
    - Page Graph

- **Page Graph:**
  - The DOM represents a directed graph.
  - Graph branches can be effectively compared, and the depth and nature of template engines form a unique fingerprint.
