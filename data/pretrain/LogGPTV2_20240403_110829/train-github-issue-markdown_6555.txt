There may already be a "standard" in some of the formats for this (e.g.
XLIFF), or maybe it's a bad idea for some reason I don't see. Here's the
situation:
Imagine you're using translation "keys" (e.g. `->trans('first_name')` instead
of `->trans('First Name')`). When you do this, you may often get duplicate
keys that should be translated to the same word, causing a translation
resource that might look like this:
    registration_first_name: First Name
    profile_first_name: First Name
This is a DX issue, because it means you have duplicated keys that you need to
manage. It also makes you want to stop using more descriptive keys to try to
have less duplicates. Also, with a bundle like `FOSUserBundle` where form
labels are turned into keys, you can't avoid duplication
(https://github.com/FriendsOfSymfony/FOSUserBundle/blob/master/Resources/translations/FOSUserBundle.en.yml).
I propose that we can "alias" a translation key to use the value of another:
    registration_first_name: "@profile_first_name"
    profile_first_name: First Name
Thoughts?
