# Environment
    Windows build number: [run `[Environment]::OSVersion` for powershell, or `ver` for cmd]
    Windows Terminal version (if applicable): Microsoft Windows NT 10.0.18362.0   
    Any other software?  msbuild
# Steps to reproduce
  1. Log into a machine over RDP
  2. Open a terminal cmd session
  3. Start a build using msbuild.exe
  4. Close RDP session
# Expected behavior
It's expected that the build will continue in the background even after the
RDP session is disconnected.
# Actual behavior
Terminal output is blocked, causing the build to be blocked as well. This
means that the build will not proceed until reconnecting the RDP session or
logging into the host machine.
