nity is dedicated to a certain app category. The TSI is calculated as
where U(a) and U(b) are the sets of trackers in the ATS local community a and
app category b.
|U (a)|
We plot the distribution of the tracker specialization index for 56 non-popular
tracker communities in Fig. 5. We observe that ATS local communities tend
to be specialized in only one or two app categories with T SI ≥ 0.5, i.e. they
provide specialized tracking services relevant to particular apps. For instance, the
Education apps are mostly tracked by some ATS local communities run by the
companies providing educational related services. Speciﬁcally, the parenting app
Yaolan is mostly tracked by the following ATS local communities:  run by Yaolan itself and  run
by the app PCbaby that also provides parenting or educational services.
Takeaway. Mobile trackers are interconnected because popular trackers are
regularly co-occur (in the same apps) with non-popular ones. The non-popular
trackers, however, form many local communities, and the trackers in each local
community tend to track a special category of mobile apps. The very top ATSes
are often co-located in the same app, implying pervasive tracking.

3.3 How Are Users Impacted by ATSes?
ATS Monopolies. The heavy-tailed distribution of ATS popularity leads us
to conjecture that some may have a monopoly on certain user’s data, i.e. a
user may exclusively be tracked by a single ATS. To test this, we compute two
metrics. First, user tracking potential (UTP) measures the number of users that
can be potentially tracked by a mobile tracker. Given the set of all mobile users
|R| , where Si ⊂ R is the set of users that
|Si|
R, the tracker i’s UTP is U T Pi =
the tracker i can reach. Second, tracking monopoly index (TMI) measures the
extent to which a tracker reaches users that others do not have. Let mj denote
the number of mobile trackers that can reach the user j ∈ Si. The TMI of the
tracker i is T M Ii = 1|Si|
1|mj|. A high TMI indicates that some users are
exclusively reached by the tracker and maybe due to trackers’ high prevalence
or speciﬁc coverage on mobile users.

Figure 6 shows the distribution of user tracking potential and tracking
monopoly index of the top 30 ATS domains (SLDs). We rank the tracker domains
in descending order by the UTP values. The result reveals a high penetration
of the tech giants in China. For example, qq.com (owned by Tencent) holds a
high UTP (over 0.8) and TMI (about 0.3) metrics, which reveals its high popu-
larity and tracking monopoly. In addition, although under 20% of mobile users
are tracked by 71.am (owned by Baidu), uc.cn (owned by Alibaba) and 360.cn
(owned by 360 security), these trackers have relatively high TMIs. This indicates
that there is a signiﬁcant pooling of tracker data within this small elite, simi-
lar to that achieved by companies such as Google and Facebook in the western
context.

ATS vs. App Traﬃc Volumes. Regardless of privacy implications, the data
sent to trackers creates increased resource usage (on devices and within the net-
work). We are next curious to see what volume of each user’s traﬃc is generated
by ATSes. Thus, we compute the ratio of tracking traﬃc to app traﬃc for indi-
vidual users, and plot the distribution in Fig. 7. The median ratio is around
1%. Nevertheless, 5% of users send over 10% of their traﬃc to trackers. That
said, the tracking traﬃc ratio per user is actually lower than that observed in
an equivalent European 3G ISP [32], possibly due to the pervasive availability
of online videos (used by 57% of users) in the 4G network. Interestingly, the
device OS also has an impact on this ratio: iOS users (median 0.9%) tend to
send less data to trackers than Android users (median 1.5%). This observation
is in accord with the 3G network [32].
PII Leakage in ATS and Regional Destination. We next proceed to
explore if any personally identiﬁable information (PII) is uploaded to ATS
domains. We process each URL from all user access logs in our dataset to test for
the presence of any PII. We use regular expressions to detect the common UIDs
on mobile devices, e.g. *\?imei=* or *&imei=*. Table 3 summarizes the things
we check for, as inspired by [27,29]. In our analysis all the UIDs collected are
anonymized to protect user privacy. To check whether the identiﬁed UIDs indeed
contain PII, we leverage a small dataset of about 10K access logs collected at our
lab’s wireless access point for one day.4 Each log in this dataset contains similar
information to the ones used in this paper. We applied the UID detection to this
dataset and found that 80% of identiﬁed IMEIs, 95% of IMSIs, 83% of MACs
and 92% of ADIDs/IDFAs indeed contain PII. This lends evidence to the claim
that inferred UID exposure detected from the DPI dataset is often correct.
Our analysis reveals a worrying volume of PII leakage: as many as 10%
of users send their PII to trackers via their mobile apps. Figure 8 shows the
distribution of how several popular tracker SLDs receive PII from apps. For each
ATS domain, say sohu.com, the percentage on the left represents the number
of ﬂows that contain UIDs. For each type of PII, the percentage on the right
represents the number of ﬂows that belong to each of the SLDs. IMEI, IMSI,
and MAC are equally likely to be collected by these trackers. The ATSes that
upload the largest volume of PII are letv.com (ad online video service) and
sohu.com (a mixture of services including ads and video): a remarkable 60% of
PII relevant ﬂows belong to them. Each ATS shows clear preferences towards
certain PII (shown in Fig. 8). For instance, letv.com mainly collects IMSI and
MAC information, while sohu.com shows balanced interests across four types of
PII. In contrast, ICCID is only accessed by 360.cn (security service).
A particular concern is whether PII is sent across borders to other countries
or regions [18]. We ﬁnd that more than 90% of PII tracking ﬂows are inside
mainland China by mapping IP geo-locations in China [37]. This may be largely
driven by the predominance of Chinese ATSes and the blocking of several key
US trackers (e.g. Google, Facebook), as well as the extensive support for HTTPs
in the majority of western countries (which is excluded from our analysis).

Takeaway. Several tech giants in China track the majority of users. Some
specialized trackers, while having relatively small user coverage, track speciﬁc
groups of users that others do not track. For 5% of users, 10% of their traﬃc is
attributable to ATS ﬂows. 10% users are exposed to PII leakage. Nevertheless,
90% of the PII data is local to China.
4 Conclusion and Discussion
This paper provides insights into the distinctive mobile tracking behavior in
China. We make several interesting observations with respect to ATS popularity
and community structure, user monopoly patterns, and PII collection. This study
not only validates many previous ﬁndings, but also facilitates fresh analysis of
tracking behavior in China. We believe that our ﬁrst look at China’s mobile
tracking patterns has signiﬁcant implications for many stakeholders in the mobile
tracking community (e.g. app vendor, tracker provider, adblocker). For instance,
adblockers can leverage the community structure for new tracker detection and
the prevalence of cross-app tracking raises serious privacy concerns. Many of the
ﬁndings are indeed worth further exploration, such as the tracker detection, the
PII collection, and the business relationships between mobile trackers.
