erator as illustrated in Fig. 17. The synchronization signal
detector comprises a data acquisition device (DAQ) [52] and
a laptop. The DAQ senses the touchscreen’s excitation signal
from the victim device via the charging cable’s GND line
or a signal probing antenna. The acquired signal is sent to
and processed by the laptop in real-time, which extracts the
excitation signal cycle and instructs the DAQ to generate
a synchronization signal at the right timing to trigger the
attack signal generator. The attack signal generator consists
of a signal generator [57] and a power ampliﬁer [58]. The
signal generator is used to create an elaborate attack signal
for the target device, and the ampliﬁer will boost the signal’s
power before injecting it into the charging cable. Fig. 18
shows the physical implementation of the attack system. The
victim device is connected to the attack system disguised as a
malicious power socket (shown in Fig. 23) through an ordinary
charging cable with or without a power adapter.
2) Target Device: We evaluate the attack on 6 smartphones,
1 tablet, and 2 standalone capacitive touch panels listed
in Table I. All these devices have capacitive touchscreens
and can be plugged into the malicious charging socket via
a charging cable in the experiments.
3) Test Interface: To measure ghost touches, we devel-
oped an Android application named WIGHT Test (shown
in Fig. 24(a)), which can customize the number, size, shape,
and position of buttons, record the timestamps of touch events,
and provide feedback for touch interaction. Following the
typical design of touchscreen buttons [59], we set the buttons
to appear in rectangle shapes and medium sizes (2.5cm∗1cm

The buttons are aligned vertically or horizontally. For Apple
devices and standalone touch panels, we used off-the-shelf
applications or built-in system interfaces, e.g., calculators or
the pop-up windows of Bluetooth connection.
B. Overall Performance
We evaluate the overall performance of injection attacks,
alteration attacks, and DoS attacks using two main metrics,
the attack’s success rate and response time.
• Success rate. For injection and alteration attacks, we con-
sider an attack successful if the target button is touched at
least once within three seconds since the attack starts and
no other buttons are touched. DoS attacks are successful
if the device fails to respond to any human touches.
• Response time. Response time is the time duration be-
tween the start of an attack to the moment it succeeds.
1) Injection Attacks: We divide the target devices into
three types according to their driving methods as introduced
in Sec. V-A. Because ghost touches appear in different po-
sitions on various types of devices, we customized the test
interface based on the possible attack outcomes of each device
type, i.e., placing buttons in the area where ghost touches may
appear. We repeated the attack 30 times on each device and
measured the success rate.
We found injection attacks successful on all devices. The
detailed attack parameters and success rates are reported
in Table I. The overall success rate averaged over the 9 devices
is 62.2%, and the success rate on individual devices can reach
up to 83.3% on a Nexus 5X smartphone and 93.3% on a
TI CAPTIVATE-PHONE touch panel. As a case study, we
measured the response time of 40 successful injection attacks
on two smartphones (Xiaomi Mi Mix 2 and Nexus 5X). To
compare with the response time of normal human touches,
we recruited 20 participants including 4 females and 16 males
aged between 20 and 50, and asked them to press a random
button as soon as possible after seeing the prompt in WIGHT
Test. We recorded the response time of 2 trials for each
participant. Fig. 22 shows the cumulative distribution function
(CDF) of response time for attacks and humans. The result
indicates that WIGHT attack can inject ghost touches in around
0.5-1s, which is faster than human touches (around 1-2s).
2) Alteration Attacks: We evaluated the success rate of
alteration attacks with 30 repeated trials on each device.
As this experiment requires human participants to physically
touch the device while we launch the attack, we have carefully
followed safety regulations and applied safety measures to
protect human participants despite the absence of the local
Institutional Review Board (IRB). For example, we limited
the duration and current of the attack signal within the safety
boundaries [60], [61], [62]. The experiment risks and protec-
tion methods are described in Appendix A. Table II shows
the attack parameters and success rates of alteration attacks
on each device. The success rate is 47% on average and can
reach up to 66.7% on the Xiaomi Mi Mix 2 smartphone.
3) DoS Attacks: We evaluated DoS attacks using the setups
and safety measures similar to alteration attacks. We measured
the success rates of DoS attacks while the participants were
performing eight common touch services including single-tap,
double-tap, stretch, pinch, swipe up, swipe down, swipe left,
and swipe right. Similarly, we repeated the trials 30 times on
each device and found the attack successful on all devices
and types of touch services. The results in Table II show an

C. Factors Affecting WIGHT Attack
We evaluate the impact of signal magnitude and charging
cables/power adapters on the performance of WIGHT attack.
1) Signal magnitude: As discussed in Sec. V-A, a stronger
attack signal may cause a greater interference on touchscreens.
To evaluate the impact of signal magnitude on the attack’s
success rate, we tested injection attacks on two smartphones
(Xiaomi Mi Mix 2 and LG Nexus 5X) at various levels of RMS
voltages (53V, 71V, 88V, 110V, and 113V) and repeated the
trials 20 times on each device. The results in Table III show
that the success rate of injection attacks generally increases
with higher signal magnitudes.
2) Charging Cables and Adapters: We evaluated the im-
pact of 13 charging cables and 6 power adapters shown
in Fig. 24(b). Referring to the measurement method of CM
voltage [63], we used the evaluation setup in Fig. 25. We
injected a sinusoidal signal with a frequency of 300 kHz
and an RMS voltage of 106.0 V into the charging cables
or power adapters and used an oscilloscope to measure the
signal that ﬂowed into the charging cable. We found that
the signal magnitude is reduced after transmission while the
signal frequency remains the same. We quantify the signal
attenuation with a signal transmission efﬁciency Ef :
Ef = V p1/V p0
(16)
where V p1 and V p0 are the signal’s magnitudes after and
before transmitting through the charging cable and adapter. In
addition, we also measured the success rate of injection attacks
on 3 devices (Nexus 5X, Nexus 7, and iPhone SE) connected
with different charging cables and power adapters using the
setup in Fig. 26. The results in Table IV indicate that WIGHT
attack is effective with most charging cables and even across
Fig. 19. An illustration of three practical scenarios of the
injection attack: picking up an eavesdropping phone call,
receiving malicious ﬁles, and approving the Bluetooth con-
nection request.
power adapters, which we assume is due to the high signal
transmission efﬁciency of charging cables and power adapters.
Though the voltage converters in power adapters are physically
isolated, we believe the CM signal can go through the parasitic
capacitors of the isolation transformer to the GND port [63].
We also found that a few charging cables and power adapters
that have low signal transmission efﬁciencies typically render
a lower attack success rate. As discussed earlier, we believe the
success rates can be increased with higher signal magnitudes.
D. Potential Attack Scenarios
To demonstrate the potential real-world threat of WIGHT
attack, we evaluate three real-world scenarios including con-
trolling devices, misdirecting options, and blocking operations.
1) Controlling Devices: In this scenario, an attacker can
surreptitiously control the victim device by injecting ghost
touches when the user is not using the device. Fig. 19
shows three typical scenarios of injection attack: picking up
an eavesdropping phone call, accepting malicious ﬁles, and
approving a Bluetooth connection request. (1) An attacker can
make a phone call to the victim device and then inject ghost
touches to pick up the eavesdropping phone call. In Fig. 27,
when the Xiaomi Mi Mix 2 was called, the attacker transmitted
the attack signal with transmission period Ttr = 8.354ms,
transmission delay Tde = 5.6ms, and transmission duration
Tdu = 1.2ms. As a result, the touchpoints were injected into
the right side of the touchscreen, and then the phone call
was picked up. We have successfully picked up the phone
call 6 times in 10 trials. (2) Similarly, the attacker may also
implant malware via ﬁle sharing. As shown in Fig. 28, we
could transfer a malicious ﬁle to the victim’s smartphone and
inject ghost touches to accept the ﬁle. (3) In addition, WIGHT
can approve a Bluetooth connection request. Fig. 29 shows the
process of connecting AirPods by injecting ghost touches. If
the Bluetooth service of Apple products is available when the
attacker approaches with an AirPods, the victim device will
pop up a “Connect” button on the screen [64]. The attacker
