### Synchronization Signal Detector
The synchronization signal detector, as illustrated in Fig. 17, consists of a data acquisition device (DAQ) [52] and a laptop. The DAQ is responsible for sensing the touchscreen’s excitation signal from the victim device via the charging cable’s GND line or a signal probing antenna. The acquired signal is then transmitted to the laptop in real-time, where it is processed to extract the excitation signal cycle. Based on this information, the laptop instructs the DAQ to generate a synchronization signal at the appropriate timing to trigger the attack signal generator. The attack signal generator comprises a signal generator [57] and a power amplifier [58]. The signal generator creates a sophisticated attack signal, which is then amplified by the power amplifier before being injected into the charging cable. Fig. 18 shows the physical implementation of the attack system, where the victim device is connected to the attack system, disguised as a malicious power socket (Fig. 23), through an ordinary charging cable with or without a power adapter.

### Target Devices
We evaluated the attack on 6 smartphones, 1 tablet, and 2 standalone capacitive touch panels listed in Table I. All these devices have capacitive touchscreens and can be connected to the malicious charging socket via a charging cable in the experiments.

### Test Interface
To measure ghost touches, we developed an Android application named WIGHT Test (Fig. 24(a)). This application allows customization of the number, size, shape, and position of buttons, records the timestamps of touch events, and provides feedback for touch interaction. Following the typical design of touchscreen buttons [59], we set the buttons to appear in rectangular shapes and medium sizes (2.5 cm × 1 cm for Huawei nova 2 and 3 cm × 1 cm for other Android devices). The buttons are aligned vertically or horizontally. For Apple devices and standalone touch panels, we used off-the-shelf applications or built-in system interfaces, such as calculators or Bluetooth connection pop-up windows.

### Overall Performance
We evaluated the overall performance of injection attacks, alteration attacks, and DoS attacks using two main metrics: the attack’s success rate and response time.

- **Success Rate**: For injection and alteration attacks, an attack is considered successful if the target button is touched at least once within three seconds after the attack starts, and no other buttons are touched. DoS attacks are successful if the device fails to respond to any human touches.
- **Response Time**: Response time is the duration between the start of an attack and the moment it succeeds.

#### Injection Attacks
We categorized the target devices into three types based on their driving methods, as introduced in Section V-A. Since ghost touches appear in different positions on various types of devices, we customized the test interface for each device type, placing buttons in areas where ghost touches might appear. We repeated the attack 30 times on each device and measured the success rate.

Injection attacks were successful on all devices. The detailed attack parameters and success rates are reported in Table I. The overall success rate averaged over the 9 devices is 62.2%, with individual device success rates reaching up to 83.3% on a Nexus 5X smartphone and 93.3% on a TI CAPTIVATE-PHONE touch panel. As a case study, we measured the response time of 40 successful injection attacks on two smartphones (Xiaomi Mi Mix 2 and Nexus 5X). To compare with the response time of normal human touches, we recruited 20 participants (4 females and 16 males aged between 20 and 50) and asked them to press a random button as soon as possible after seeing the prompt in WIGHT Test. We recorded the response time of 2 trials for each participant. Fig. 22 shows the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of response time for attacks and humans. The results indicate that WIGHT attacks can inject ghost touches in approximately 0.5-1 second, which is faster than human touches (approximately 1-2 seconds).

#### Alteration Attacks
We evaluated the success rate of alteration attacks with 30 repeated trials on each device. This experiment required human participants to physically touch the device while the attack was launched. We carefully followed safety regulations and applied safety measures to protect the human participants, despite the absence of local Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval. For example, we limited the duration and current of the attack signal within safety boundaries [60], [61], [62]. The experiment risks and protection methods are described in Appendix A. Table II shows the attack parameters and success rates of alteration attacks on each device. The average success rate is 47% and can reach up to 66.7% on the Xiaomi Mi Mix 2 smartphone.

#### DoS Attacks
We evaluated DoS attacks using similar setups and safety measures as in alteration attacks. We measured the success rates of DoS attacks while participants performed eight common touch services, including single-tap, double-tap, stretch, pinch, swipe up, swipe down, swipe left, and swipe right. We repeated the trials 30 times on each device and found the attack successful on all devices and types of touch services. The results in Table II show an average success rate of 85.9% and a 100% success rate on 5 devices.

### Factors Affecting WIGHT Attack
We evaluated the impact of signal magnitude and charging cables/power adapters on the performance of WIGHT attacks.

#### Signal Magnitude
As discussed in Section V-A, a stronger attack signal may cause greater interference on touchscreens. To evaluate the impact of signal magnitude on the attack’s success rate, we tested injection attacks on two smartphones (Xiaomi Mi Mix 2 and LG Nexus 5X) at various levels of RMS voltages (53V, 71V, 88V, 110V, and 113V) and repeated the trials 20 times on each device. The results in Table III show that the success rate of injection attacks generally increases with higher signal magnitudes.

#### Charging Cables and Adapters
We evaluated the impact of 13 charging cables and 6 power adapters shown in Fig. 24(b). Referring to the measurement method of CM voltage [63], we used the evaluation setup in Fig. 25. We injected a sinusoidal signal with a frequency of 300 kHz and an RMS voltage of 106.0 V into the charging cables or power adapters and used an oscilloscope to measure the signal that flowed into the charging cable. We found that the signal magnitude is reduced after transmission while the signal frequency remains the same. We quantify the signal attenuation with a signal transmission efficiency \( E_f \):

\[
E_f = \frac{V_{p1}}{V_{p0}}
\]

where \( V_{p1} \) and \( V_{p0} \) are the signal magnitudes after and before transmitting through the charging cable and adapter. Additionally, we measured the success rate of injection attacks on 3 devices (Nexus 5X, Nexus 7, and iPhone SE) connected with different charging cables and power adapters using the setup in Fig. 26. The results in Table IV indicate that WIGHT attacks are effective with most charging cables and even across power adapters, which we attribute to the high signal transmission efficiency of charging cables and power adapters. Although the voltage converters in power adapters are physically isolated, we believe the CM signal can pass through the parasitic capacitors of the isolation transformer to the GND port [63]. We also found that a few charging cables and power adapters with low signal transmission efficiencies typically render a lower attack success rate. As discussed earlier, we believe the success rates can be increased with higher signal magnitudes.

### Potential Attack Scenarios
To demonstrate the potential real-world threat of WIGHT attacks, we evaluated three real-world scenarios: controlling devices, misdirecting options, and blocking operations.

#### Controlling Devices
In this scenario, an attacker can surreptitiously control the victim device by injecting ghost touches when the user is not using the device. Fig. 19 shows three typical scenarios of injection attacks: picking up an eavesdropping phone call, accepting malicious files, and approving a Bluetooth connection request.

1. **Picking Up an Eavesdropping Phone Call**: An attacker can make a phone call to the victim device and then inject ghost touches to pick up the eavesdropping phone call. In Fig. 27, when the Xiaomi Mi Mix 2 was called, the attacker transmitted the attack signal with a transmission period \( T_{tr} = 8.354 \) ms, transmission delay \( T_{de} = 5.6 \) ms, and transmission duration \( T_{du} = 1.2 \) ms. As a result, the touchpoints were injected into the right side of the touchscreen, and the phone call was picked up. We successfully picked up the phone call 6 times in 10 trials.
2. **Accepting Malicious Files**: Similarly, the attacker may implant malware via file sharing. As shown in Fig. 28, we could transfer a malicious file to the victim’s smartphone and inject ghost touches to accept the file.
3. **Approving a Bluetooth Connection Request**: WIGHT can also approve a Bluetooth connection request. Fig. 29 shows the process of connecting AirPods by injecting ghost touches. If the Bluetooth service of Apple products is available when the attacker approaches with an AirPods, the victim device will pop up a "Connect" button on the screen [64]. The attacker can then inject ghost touches to approve the connection request.

### Conclusion
The WIGHT attack demonstrates a significant real-world threat, capable of controlling devices, misdirecting options, and blocking operations. The success of the attack depends on factors such as signal magnitude and the quality of charging cables and power adapters. Future work should focus on developing countermeasures to mitigate the risk of such attacks.
