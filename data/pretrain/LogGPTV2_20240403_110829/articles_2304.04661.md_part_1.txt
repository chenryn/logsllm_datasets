is imperative. AIOps is the key to achieve high availability,
scalability and operational efficiency. For example, AIOps
can use AI models can automatically analyze large volumes
oftelemetrydatatodetectanddiagnoseincidentsmuchfaster,
and much more consistently than humans, which can help
achieve ambitious targets such as 99.99 availability. AIOps
can dynamically scale its capabilities with growth demands
and use AI for automated incident and resource management,
thereby reducing the burden of hiring and training domain
experts to meet growth requirements. Moreover, automation
through AIOps helps save valuable developer time, and avoid
fatigue. AIOps, as an emerging AI technology, appeared
on the trending chart of Gartner Hyper Cycle for Artificial
Intelligence in 2017 [5], along with other popular topics such
as deep reinforcement learning, nature-language generation
and artificial general intelligence. As of 2022, enterprise
AIOps solutions have witnessed increased adoption by many
companies’ IT infrastructure. The AIOps market size is
predicted to be $11.02B by end of 2023 with cumulative
annual growth rate (CAGR) of 34%.
AIOps comprises a set of complex problems. Transforming
from manual to automated operations using AIOps is not a
one-step effort. Based on the adoption level of AI techniques,
