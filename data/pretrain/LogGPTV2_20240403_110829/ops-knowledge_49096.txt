User:  How to implement the process of deploying an SSL certificate on a web server built using an AWS EC2 instance
Assistant: The following are the steps to deploy an SSL certificate on a web server built using an AWS EC2 instance: 1. Obtain an SSL certificate You can obtain an SSL certificate from an SSL provider (for example, Let's Encrypt or DigiCert). Before obtaining a certificate, make sure you have control of your domain name. You need to generate your own CSR file, which the SSL provider will use to generate the certificate. Each SSL provider has different certificate generation steps, please follow their guide. 2. Install the SSL certificate To install the SSL certificate on your AWS EC2 instance, you need to upload the certificate and private key files to your server. The location of the uploaded certificate and private key files can be anywhere, but typically they are located somewhere in the root directory of the operating system. Also, when uploading the certificate and private key files, make sure you make them accessible only to administrators. 3. Enable SSL The way to enable SSL depends on your web server. If you use Apache, you need to edit the Apache configuration file, which is located at /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf. Open the file and find the following line: LoadModule ssl_module modules/mod_ssl.so Uncomment it to enable ssl_module. Next, find the following line: #Include conf/extra/httpd-ssl.conf Uncomment it to enable SSL by loading this module. Save the changes and restart the Apache service. If you are using Nginx, you need to edit the configuration file, located at /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf. Add the following line in it: server { listen 443 ssl; ssl_certificate /path/to/certificate.crt; ssl_certificate_key /path/to/private_key.key; } 4. Restart the web server After completing the above steps, you need to restart your web server for the changes to take effect. This command may vary depending on your web server. If using Apache, restart the Apache service with: $ sudo systemctl restart httpd If using Nginx, restart the Nginx service with: $ sudo systemctl restart nginx Your web server on your AWS EC2 instance is now SSL deployed Certificate, your website can be accessed through HTTPS.
