User: Question: In command line, how do I call a python script without having to type python in front of the script's name? Is this even possible?

Info:
I wrote a handy script for accessing sqlite databases from command line, but I kind of don't like having to type "python SQLsap args" and would rather just type "SQLsap args". I don't know if this is even possible, but it would be good to know if it is. For more than just this program.
Assistant: You want a shebang. #!/path/to/python. Put that on the first line of your python script. The #! is actually a magic number that tells the operating system to interpret the file as a script for the program named. You can supply /usr/bin/python or, to be more portable, /usr/bin/env python which calls the /usr/bin/env program and tells it you want the system's installed Python interpreter.
You'll also have to put your script in your path, unless you're okay with typing ./SQLsap args.
