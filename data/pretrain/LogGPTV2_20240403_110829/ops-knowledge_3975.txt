Question: "Why are digital signatures critical in the Bitcoin security model for ensuring that a user's identity cannot be impersonated by an attacker?"
 "A": "Digital signatures are crucial because they are unforgeable and an attacker without the secret signing key cannot create a signature that validates with the original public key."
 "B": "Digital signatures are essential because they rely on a centralized authority to certify the identity of users, which prevents impersonation."
 "C": "Digital signatures provide security solely because they encrypt messages, which means only the intended recipient can read the message content."
 "D": "Digital signatures are not necessary for security because all transactions are public, and the community can identify malicious behavior."
Answer: A
