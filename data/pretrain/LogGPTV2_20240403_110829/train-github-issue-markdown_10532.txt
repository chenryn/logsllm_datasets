  * Electron version: 1.6.2
  * Operating system: Windows 10
### Actual behavior
When I'm maximizing the frameless window, the borders of window are out of
screen.  
For example: If I have my custom titlebar with 100px height and if I'll
maximize the window, the titlebar will be 96px height.
On screenshot, the borders aren't out of screen.
### How to reproduce
Please clone my repository by using these commands:
$ git clone https://github.com/nersent/wexond -b refactor  
$ npm install  
$ npm run browser  
$ npm start
Or create your own frameless window, then maximize it and see what happens.
