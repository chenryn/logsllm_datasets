User: Now it is necessary to provide an automated configuration management solution for a batch of servers, which requires automatic deployment and monitoring. Please provide a detailed plan and implementation steps.
Assistant: 1. Solution overview This solution uses Ansible for automatic server configuration management to realize automatic deployment, monitoring and other functions. The specific solution is as follows: 1. Install Ansible. 2. Write Ansible Playbook files for different servers, including installing and deploying programs, configuring environment variables, configuring system services, and installing dependent packages. 3. For the server that needs to be monitored, write an Ansible Playbook file, configure monitoring plug-ins, set alarm rules and other operations. 4. Upload the prepared Playbook file to the Ansible master control node. 5. On the Ansible master control node, configure the Ansible Inventory file, specify the address of the server to be managed, the management user name, and the management password. 6. Execute the Ansible Playbook file to realize automatic deployment, monitoring and other functions. 2. Implementation steps 1. Install Ansible Execute the following commands on the Ansible master control node: ``` yum install -y epel-release yum install -y ansible ``` 2. Write Ansible Playbook files for different servers, write different Playbook files, such as web servers, database servers, application servers, etc., respectively include operations such as installing and deploying programs, configuring environment variables, configuring system services, and installing dependent packages. For example, the Playbook file of the web server (named web.yml), the content is as follows: ``` - hosts: webservers remote_user: root tasks: - name: Install Apache Web Server yum: name: httpd state: latest - name: Start Apache Web Server service: name: httpd state: started enabled: true ``` For the server that needs to be monitored, write a monitor.yml Playbook file with the following content: ``` - hosts: monitorservers remote_user: root tasks: - name: Install Monitor Plugin yum : name: monitor-plugin state: latest - name: Configure Monitor Plugin template: src: templates/monitor.cfg.j2 dest: /etc/monitor.cfg mode: '0644' ``` 3. Upload the Playbook file and it will be written Upload the Playbook file to the Ansible master control node. It is recommended to place different types of Playbook files in different directories. For example, create a web directory (playbook file for the web server) and a monitor directory (playbook file for the monitoring server), and execute the following command on the Ansible master node: ``` mkdir /etc/ansible/web mkdir /etc/ansible /monitor cd /etc/ansible/web vi web.yml cd ../monitor vi monitor.yml ``` 4. Configure the Ansible Inventory file On the Ansible master control node, configure the Ansible Inventory file, specify the address of the server to be managed, Manage usernames, manage passwords, etc. For example, create a new hosts file in the /etc/ansible directory, and configure it as follows: ``` [webservers] web1 ansible_host=192.168.1.10 web2 ansible_host=192.168.1.11 [monitorservers] monitor1 ansible_host=192.168.1.12 monitor2 ansible_host=192.168 .1.13 [all :vars] ansible_user=root ansible_password=your_password ``` 5. Execute the Ansible Playbook file Execute the following command on the Ansible master node to execute the web.yml Playbook file. ``` ansible-playbook /etc/ansible/web/web.yml ``` Execute the following command on the Ansible master node to execute the monitor.yml Playbook file. ``` ansible-playbook /etc/ansible/monitor/monitor.yml ``` The above is a basic automated configuration management solution, which can be customized and extended according to specific situations.
