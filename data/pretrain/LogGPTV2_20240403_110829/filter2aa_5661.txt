### CAN Opener, CAN, 150pts

Our operatives have recovered a DeLorean in the ruins of an old mid-western U.S. town. The vehicle appears to be locked, but we have successfully accessed its internal communication channels. Based on the limited data available, the DeLorean uses an outdated technology known as the Controller Area Network (CAN) bus. Your task is to analyze the communications and find a way to unlock the vehicle. Once unlocked, you must retrieve the secret flag stored inside.

We believe that gaining entry to the vehicle should be a relatively straightforward challenge. To assist you, we have restored and reconnected the vehicle's dashboard.

Good luck.

### Challenge Details

This was the first challenge related to the CAN bus. The board we received has two CAN controllers connected to each other, allowing the AVR chip to communicate with itself in a loopback mode. This setup simulates a full, car-wide CAN bus. By connecting a logic analyzer to the CAN bus, we were able to capture the messages being sent. One message, in particular, caught our attention: `lock\x00\x00\x00\x00`. We hypothesized that the opposite command would be `unlock\x00\x00`.

At the time, I did not have any dedicated CAN hardware, but I had an Arduino. I developed a software implementation of the CAN bus to send the unlock message. While this implementation is not very efficient, lacks error-checking, and has poor code quality, it was sufficient for our purposes.

After the board received the unlock message, it transmitted the flag through the UART interface to the dashboard.

This solution allowed us to successfully unlock the DeLorean and retrieve the secret flag.
