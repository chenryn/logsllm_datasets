I upgraded to React v16 and chai-enzyme v3, and any component test that I have
that utilizes Material ui (particularly MuiThemeProvider) that is `mounted`
throws various errors like the following:
`TypeError: Cannot set property 'stroke' of undefined`  
`TypeError: Cannot set property 'display' of undefined`
  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
I tried to create a codepen to make an example but i was unable to setup
enzyme test runner.
## Expected Behavior
React v16 and material ui together should not break all tests.
## Current Behavior
Material UI combined with enzyme 3 and react v16 break all tests  
Note: this does not effect the actual components in a browser, only in the
test environment when `mounted` via enzyme, and that mounted component also
happens to use MuiThemeProvider.
## Context
Cannot upgrade to react v16, this is the last thing I need to fix to get my
tests running and finally upgrade.
