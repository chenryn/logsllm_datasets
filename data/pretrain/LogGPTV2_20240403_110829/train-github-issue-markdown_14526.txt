### Issue Description

After upgrading to React v16 and chai-enzyme v3, I encountered several errors in my component tests that use Material-UI, particularly when `MuiThemeProvider` is involved. The tests fail with the following error messages:
- `TypeError: Cannot set property 'stroke' of undefined`
- `TypeError: Cannot set property 'display' of undefined`

I have searched through the issues in this repository and believe this is not a duplicate. I attempted to create a CodePen example but was unable to set up the Enzyme test runner.

### Expected Behavior

React v16 and Material-UI should work together without breaking all tests.

### Current Behavior

When using Material-UI in combination with Enzyme v3 and React v16, all tests fail. This issue only affects the test environment when components are `mounted` via Enzyme, and specifically when `MuiThemeProvider` is used. The actual components function correctly in the browser.

### Context

This issue is preventing me from upgrading to React v16, as it is the last remaining problem I need to resolve to get my tests running and complete the upgrade.

### Technical Details

- **Material-UI**: v0.19.4
- **React**: v16.0.0
- **Enzyme**: v3.0.0
