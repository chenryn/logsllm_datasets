User: 编写一个查询，为您提供上周按天和按小时的页面浏览总数。
Assistant: 可以通过子查询的方式，分别计算按天和按小时的统计：
```starttime="-1w" | bucket timestamp span=1h as ts | stats count() as views by ts | append [[ starttime="-1w" | bucket timestamp span=1d as ts | stats count() as views by ts ]]```
也可以在计算完按小时统计后，通过 multireport 命令，在保留结果的同时做二次统计得到按天的结果：
```starttime="-1w" | bucket timestamp span=1h as ts | stats count() as views by ts | multireport [[ table * ]] [[ | bucket ts span=1d as ts1 | stats sum(views) as views by ts1 | rename ts1 as ts]]```
