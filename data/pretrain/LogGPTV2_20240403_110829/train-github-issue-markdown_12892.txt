Subject: Issues with Bootstrap Website Resources

Hello,

I hope this message finds you well. I have encountered some issues while accessing the Bootstrap website at <http://twbs.github.io/bootstrap/>. Specifically, several resources are not being found, as indicated by the 404 errors in the Chrome console:

- `GET http://twbs.github.io/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css 404 (Not Found)`
- `GET http://twbs.github.io/assets/css/docs.min.css 404 (Not Found)`
- `GET http://twbs.github.io/assets/js/docs.min.js 404 (Not Found)`
- `GET http://twbs.github.io/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js 404 (Not Found)`

As a result, the main index page is not loading correctly, and the links on the page are also non-functional. However, other pages on the site appear to be working fine.

Could you please look into this and resolve the missing resource issues? 

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Best regards,  
Jamal
