User: The following is 20 lines of a system log. Each line consists of a timestamp, log level, process id, relevant software component, and the log content. Think step-by-step and step and summarize this log chunk:

Assistant: This log chunk is related to the system's network connection. It begins with the kernel resuming AWDL and sandboxd denying network-outbound access to mDNSResponder. Wirelessproxd then reports that the peripheral manager is not powered on, and QQ denies mach-lookup to networking captivenetworksupport. The kernel then skips 19622 xpmapped pages and builds an act device entry. QQ then fails to establish a network route, and Dock notifies a best app suggestion. Com.apple.AddressBook.InternetAccountsBridge then attempts to connect to a server three times, and the kernel allocates pages for hibernation. BezelServices then asserts a device address, and networkd performs a CrazyIvan46. The kernel then sets the AWDL operation mode from suspended to auto, and com.apple.AddressBook.InternetAccountsBridge attempts to connect to a server again. Finally, the kernel sets all pages for hibernation and IOThunderboltSwitch reports a Thunderbolt HPD packet.
