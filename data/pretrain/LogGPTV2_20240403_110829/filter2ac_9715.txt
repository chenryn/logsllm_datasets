## Abstract
The CINBAD (CERN Investigation of Network Behaviour and Anomaly Detection) project, initiated in 2007 in collaboration with ProCurve Networking by HP, aims to understand the behavior of large computer networks in high-performance computing and large campus environments, such as CERN's network, which currently includes approximately 70,000 Gigabit user ports. The project's objectives include detecting traffic anomalies, performing trend analysis, automatically implementing countermeasures, and providing post-mortem analysis capabilities. This paper will outline the main principles, data sources, data collection and analysis methods, and initial findings of the project.

**Keywords:** Computer networks, anomaly detection, packet sampling, network monitoring

## 1. Network Anomalies
Anomalies are a common occurrence in modern computer networks, with diverse causes including network faults, malicious attacks, viruses, worms, misconfigurations, and policy violations. An anomaly is generally defined as a deviation from the expected (normal) behavior of the system. However, normal behavior is not static, and defining and detecting non-trivial anomalies can be challenging.

## 2. sFlow Packet Sampling and Other Data Sources
Monitoring all packets in high-speed networks is impractical. sFlow, an industry standard for monitoring high-speed switched networks, addresses this issue by providing random samples of the first 128 bytes of network traffic. These samples are crucial for the CINBAD team's analysis, which is based on data from over 1,500 switches and routers at CERN. The team also leverages other data sources, such as reports from the central antivirus service, detailed DNS server logs, and other central services, to augment the information provided by packet sampling. Correlating data from multiple sources helps in identifying interesting phenomena.

## 3. Data Analysis
The CINBAD team has explored various data analysis approaches, primarily categorized into statistical and signature-based methods. 

- **Statistical Analysis:** This method involves detecting deviations from normal network behavior. Establishing expected network activity can be done by specifying allowed patterns in specific parts of the network. Alternatively, normal profiles can be built by learning from historical data, using robust metrics that are resistant to data randomness. Once these profiles are established, the statistical approach can detect new and unknown anomalies. However, it may not provide sufficient information to identify the type of anomaly.

- **Signature-Based Analysis:** This method uses existing problem signatures and matches them against the current state of the network. SNORT, an open-source intrusion detection system, is a prominent example. The CINBAD team has successfully ported and adapted SNORT rules to work with sampled data, achieving a low false positive rate. However, this approach can yield false negatives for unknown anomalies.

To leverage the strengths of both methods, the CINBAD project combines statistical and signature-based analysis. The signature-based approach provides fast and reliable detection, while the statistical approach detects unknown anomalies and generates new signatures.

## 4. Initial Findings
Using the described approach, the CINBAD team continuously monitors both campus and Internet traffic. Several types of misbehavior have been identified, including DNS abuse, peer-to-peer applications, rogue DHCP servers, worms, trojans, and unauthorized wireless base stations. Some of these findings have led to the refinement of security policies.
