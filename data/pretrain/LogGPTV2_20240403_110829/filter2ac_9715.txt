Abstract. The CINBAD (CERN Investigation of Network Behaviour
and Anomaly Detection) project was launched in 2007 in collaboration
with ProCurve Networking by HP. The project mission is to understand
the behaviour of large computer networks in the context of high per-
formance computing and large campus installations such as at CERN,
whose network today counts roughly 70,000 Gigabit user ports. The goals
of the project are to be able to detect traﬃc anomalies in such systems,
perform trend analysis, automatically take counter measures and provide
post-mortem analysis facilities. This paper will present the main project
principles, data sources, data collection and analysis approaches as well
as the initial ﬁndings.
Keywords: computer networks, anomaly detection, packet sampling,
network monitoring.
1 Network Anomalies
Anomalies are nowadays a fact of life in computer networks. However anomaly
deﬁnition is very domain speciﬁc and the causes are diverse (network faults,
malicious attacks, viruses and worms, misconﬁguration, policy violations, etc).
The following common denominator can be factored out: an anomaly is always
a deviation of the system from the normal (expected) behaviour (baseline); the
normal behaviour (baseline) is never stationary and anomalies are not always
easy to deﬁne. As a consequence, non-trivial anomalies are not easy to detect.
2 sFlow Packet Sampling and Other Data Sources
With the modern high-speed networks it is impossible to monitor all the packets
traversing the links. sFlow, the industry standard for monitoring high-speed
switched networks overcomes this issue by providing randomly sampled packets
(ﬁrst 128 bytes) from the network traﬃc. These initial bytes provide crucial
information for the analysis conducted by the CINBAD team. Our collection
and analysis is based on traﬃc from more than 1500 switches and routers around

CERN. The CINBAD team also investigates other data sources that can be used
to augment the information provided by the packet sampling. At CERN we can
use the reports from the central antivirus service, detailed logs from the DNS
servers and other central services. Information from many diﬀerent data sources
may be correlated in order to ﬁnd interesting phenomena.
3 Data Analysis
We have been investigating various data analysis approaches that could be cat-
egorised mainly into the two domains: statistical and signature based analysis.
The former depends on detecting deviations from normal network behaviour
while the latter uses existing problem signatures and matches them against the
current state of the network. The signature based approach has numerous prac-
tical applications with SNORT (an opensource intrusion detection system) being
a prominent example. The CINBAD team has successfully ported SNORT and
adapted various rules in order to work with sampled data. It seems to perform
well, and provides a low false positive rate. However, the system is blind and can
yield false negatives in case of unknown anomalies. Fortunately, this problem
can be addressed by the statistical approach. This requires the understanding
of the normal network behaviour. Expected network activity can be established
by specifying the allowed patterns in certain parts of the network. While this
method can work very well for a DNS or Web server that are supposed to be
contacted only on a given protocol port number, for more general purposes this
approach would not scale.
A second approach to infer the normal network behaviour is to build various
network proﬁles by learning from the past. Selection of robust metrics that are
resistant to data randomness plays important role in characterising the expected
network behaviour. Once these normal proﬁles are well established the statistical
approach can detect new and unknown anomalies. However, this might not pro-
vide suﬃcient information to identify the anomaly type. The CINBAD project
combines the statistical approach with the signature based analysis in order to
beneﬁt from the synergy of the two techniques. While the latter provides the
detection system with a fast and reliable detection rate, the former is used to
detect the unknown anomalies and to produce new signatures.
4 Initial Findings
By using the described approach the CINBAD team performs constant moni-
toring of both campus and Internet traﬃc. A certain number of misbehaviours
were identiﬁed, for example: DNS abuse, p2p applications, rogue DHCP servers,
worms, trojans, unauthorised wireless base stations, etc. Some of our ﬁndings
resulted in the reﬁnement of the security policies.
