User: I am looking for a way to convert a Python Program to a .exe file WITHOUT using py2exe. py2exe says it requires Python 2.6, which is outdated. Is there a way this is possible so I can distribute my Python program without the end-user having to install Python?
Assistant: For this you have two choices:

A downgrade to python 2.6. This is generally undesirable because it is backtracking and may nullify a small portion of your scripts
Your second option is to use some form of exe converter. I recommend pyinstaller as it seems to have the best results.
