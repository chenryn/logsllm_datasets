### Describe the issue:
There seems to be something whacky with the type annotations for np.sinc that
causes mypy to later think that an array is a boolean array when clearly it is
not. See the reproducing code below. This seems to have started with numpy
1.22 (presumably due to the more accuracy dtype annotations). Changing
`np.sinc` to `np.sin` or `np.exp` makes the problem disappear, which is why I
assume it is specific to `sinc`.
### Reproduce the code example:
    import numpy as np
    def what_the() -> None:
        idx = np.arange(16, dtype=float)
        c = idx * np.sinc(idx)
        c /= np.sum(c)
### Error message:
    Error message from mypy 0.961:
    show_type.py:6: error: Invalid self argument "ndarray[Any, dtype[bool_]]" to attribute function "__itruediv__" with type "Callable[[ndarray[Any, dtype[floating[_NBit1]]], Union[_SupportsArray[dtype[Union[bool_, integer[Any], floating[Any]]]], _NestedSequence[_SupportsArray[dtype[Union[bool_, integer[Any], floating[Any]]]]], bool, int, float, _NestedSequence[Union[bool, int, float]]]], ndarray[Any, dtype[floating[_NBit1]]]]"
Note the `bool_` on the first line.
