Assistant: This log chunk shows the initialization of multiple child workers in the scoreboard slots 6-9. The workerEnv.init() is successful, but there are multiple errors with the mod_jk child workerEnv, with error states 6, 7, and 9. Additionally, two children (2082 and 2085) cannot be found in the scoreboard.
