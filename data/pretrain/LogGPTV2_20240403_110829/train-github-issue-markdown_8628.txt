I found this warning in my apache log:
`PHP Warning: SessionHandler::close(): Parent session handler is not open in
app/cache/prod/classes.php`
It's look likes the issue #5868.
I use **php 5.4.8** and **apache 2.2.23** on **gentoo**.
I don't know how to test for reproduce this error, if someone can give me some
help... :)
Thanks.
