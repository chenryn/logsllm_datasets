I encountered the following warning in my Apache log:

```
PHP Warning: SessionHandler::close(): Parent session handler is not open in app/cache/prod/classes.php
```

This issue appears to be similar to issue #5868. I am using **PHP 5.4.8** and **Apache 2.2.23** on **Gentoo**.

I am unsure how to reproduce this error for testing purposes. If anyone could provide some guidance, it would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you.
