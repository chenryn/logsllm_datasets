User: Please list common web application performance optimization strategies and give examples of practical applications.
Assistant: 1. Compress and combine resource files: Compress and combine JavaScript, CSS, images and other files to reduce the number of requests and transfer content, and improve page loading speed. For example, the resource files on the Baidu homepage are all compressed and merged, thereby reducing the impact of the number of HTTP requests on the page loading speed. 2. CDN Acceleration: Use Content Distribution Network (CDN) to distribute static resources to servers around the world, and improve resource loading speed through nearby access. For example, the graphic materials and pictures in the WeChat public platform are all accelerated through CDN. 3. Database optimization: Use indexes, optimize query statements, etc. to improve database processing speed. For example, social platforms such as Zhihu often face a large amount of concurrent access to data, and database optimization is required to cope with high concurrent access. 4. Front-end optimization: Optimize the front-end page by using delayed loading, asynchronous request, etc. to improve page rendering speed. For example, Taobao's product list page is implemented through lazy loading, and new product data will not be loaded until the user scrolls to the bottom. 5. Code optimization: use cache, dynamically generate pages, and more efficient algorithms to optimize code and improve operating efficiency. For example, e-commerce websites such as JD.com use a lot of caching technology to improve page access speed. 6. Server configuration optimization: Improve website performance by adjusting server configuration, such as using a more efficient web server (such as Nginx), increasing server resources, etc. For example, YouTube uses Nginx to provide efficient video services. 7. Back-end clustering: cluster multiple servers to achieve load balancing and application expansion, and improve the throughput and stability of back-end services. Large-scale services such as WeChat payment adopt a back-end clustering approach to cope with high concurrent access requirements.
