following we present only the results obtained with Ultra-
SAN; those obtained with ETMCC coincide to a high de-
gree.
PD>OD : Fig. 5 shows the difference between the two
models for the case that P E = 5.0e‚àí4 and for several val-
ues of OD ranging from 0 to 8. It is clear that model B esti-
mates the probability of an error lower than is the case with
model A. Of course, in both models, the higher the value of
OD the lower the probability of errors.
PUM : Fig. 6 shows several results for the property
PUM using the values for the parameters P and Q and
the rate of the exponential distribution of the timed activ-
ity as described in Sect. 4. The results have been obtained
for P E = 1.6E ‚àí 4 and the resilience res varying between
[0, .., 3]. The upper two curves are the results for TCF P
equal to 2400 seconds. The upper of the two giving the re-
sults for model A and the lower of the two those for model
2 We used three stations here because the prototype ETMCC currently
allows a maximum of 63 different labels to denote the atomic proper-
ties which is less than what is needed in the case of four stations. Such
restrictions will be relaxed in future versions of ETMCC.

Figure 5. Comparing PD>OD for the interleav-
ing and synchronised model
B. The third curve from above shows the experimental data
obtained for a similar setting, as has been reported in [9].
Actually, the value measured for res = 3 was equal to 0, so
the value could not be established with sufÔ¨Åcient precision
in Fig. 6. Below the third curve, two curves show the re-
sults for model A and B resp., but for TCF P equal to 2400
milliseconds, similar to those reported in [4]. Finally, the
curve at the bottom shows the results of an earlier model
developed by Coccoli et al. [9] that did not consider cor-
relation between communication failures due to fading ef-
fects. The largest models used for the quantitative analysis
were composed of 660 states and 3135 transitions for model
A and 13260 states and 43320 transitions for model B, both
for four stations, OD = 8 and in reduced base model for-
mat. For more details we refer to [17].
6.3. Discussion
It is clear that neither model A nor model B for PUM are
matching exactly the experimental data, although model B
gives a better approximation than model A. For small val-
ues of res (i.e. res = 0 or res = 1) both models consider-
ably over-estimate the probability of error, while the predic-
tion becomes better for higher values of res (res = 2), even
if there is not enough experimental data available to give
a well-informed judgement. Maybe that the correlation be-
tween transmission errors during the experiments was lower
than that assumed for the model, or, more likely, an expla-
nation could be that user messages are retransmitted only
once per round and are therefore much less susceptible to
the bursty nature of a fading channel. In other words, the
loss of user messages is much less correlated than for ex-
ample, the loss of consecutive decision messages. Unfortu-
nately, the number of losses of decision messages has not
been established in an experimental way.
Nevertheless, model B is preferred over an earlier model
developed in [9] that did not account for fading effects.
The latter considerably under-estimates the error probabili-
ties [9].

7. Conclusions
In this paper we have revisited an earlier dependability
analysis of a variant of the centralised medium access pro-
tocol of the IEEE 802.11 standard for wireless local area
networks [8]. We have analysed some of the models used in
that work both from a behavioural (qualitative) and from a
dependability (quantitative) point of view by means of the
prototype stochastic model checker ETMCC. Both qualita-
tive and quantitative properties have been formalised using
CSL.
The qualitative analysis of the concurrent behaviour of
the models showed a discrepancy between the expected
behaviour of the model and its actual behaviour. The use
of model checking allowed for the clear and unambigu-
ous speciÔ¨Åcation and veriÔ¨Åcation of the desired behavioural
properties. Some of these concerned properties over state
sequences, that can in general only be analysed in an in-
direct way by means of path-automata by current state-of-
the-art dependability analysis tools such as UltraSAN or
M¬®obius [6]. Extending these tools with (stochastic) model
checking capabilities would allow model developers to as-
sess also the often intricate concurrent behaviour of depend-
ability models.
Based on the results of the qualitative analysis we have
developed a new model, that has been shown to reÔ¨Çect more
faithfully the assumed synchronisation aspects of the proto-
col that is induced by the concept of broadcasts within sin-
gle slots and rounds of the protocol.

Two of the main dependability measures, introduced in-
formally in [8], have been formalised as formulas of the
Continuous Stochastic Logic and assessed by means of
the stochastic model checker ETMCC. The results corre-
sponded very well when on-the-Ô¨Çy steady state analysis in
ETMCC was turned off. This can be explained by the fact
that the models under analysis were very stiff.
We believe that this paper provides further evidence of
the potential advantages of the integration of (stochastic)
model checking capabilities and advanced tools for model-
based dependability and performance analysis and its appli-
cation to realistic case-studies.
In this paper we have discussed only part of the interest-
ing properties and models for the analysis of the real-time
wireless protocol. Our future research aims at a more com-
plete formal analysis of the protocol, using proper abstrac-
tion techniques and forms of compositionality in order to
address further qualitative and quantitative properties in a
coherent and systematic way.
