in the Bessel Functions section.
  1. the description of jn() and jv() are identical, however jn() should be "integer order n" while jv() should be "real order v". (c.f. the entries for yn() and yv() )
  2. in the Bessel Functions section, note that the arguments in the function list (typically x1, x2) do not match the arguments in the description (typically n(or v), z)
  3. the optional "out" parameter is not described
