User: I have created a package that I will be distributing throughout the company that replaces a legacy bash script with the same name. It is referenced many places so it needs to execute like the current script does. This has worked fine until I encountered some servers that do not have a current version of Python as the default Python (aka CentOS).
Is there a way to specify in the setup.py what shebang line is created at the top of the script file? i.e. I need #!/opt/bin/python rather than #!/usr/bin/env python.
Assistant: Run the script with /opt/bin/python script.py, or
edit the first line to read #!/opt/bin/python, or
put /opt/bin in your path before /usr/bin.
