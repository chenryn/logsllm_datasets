### Explanation

When you created a React project with TypeScript and attempted to start it, the following error occurred:

- The error is located in the `verifyTypeScriptSetup.js` file within the `react-scripts` package.
- The specific line causing the issue is attempting to assign a value to the `jsx` property of the `appTsConfig.compilerOptions` object.
- The error message indicates that the `jsx` property is read-only, and thus cannot be modified.

### Possible Solutions

1. **Check TypeScript Configuration:**
   - Ensure that your `tsconfig.json` file does not have any conflicting or read-only settings for the `jsx` property.
   - You can try removing or modifying the `jsx` property in your `tsconfig.json` to see if the issue persists.

2. **Update Dependencies:**
   - Make sure you are using the latest versions of `react-scripts`, `typescript`, and other related dependencies.
   - Run the following commands to update your dependencies:
     ```sh
     npm install react-scripts@latest
     npm install typescript@latest
     ```

3. **Clear Cache and Reinstall:**
   - Sometimes, clearing the npm cache and reinstalling the node modules can resolve such issues.
   - Run the following commands:
     ```sh
     npm cache clean --force
     rm -rf node_modules
     npm install
     ```

4. **Check for Known Issues:**
   - Look for any known issues or bug reports related to this error in the `react-scripts` GitHub repository.
   - You can also check the TypeScript and Create React App documentation for any relevant information.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the error and successfully start your React project with TypeScript.
