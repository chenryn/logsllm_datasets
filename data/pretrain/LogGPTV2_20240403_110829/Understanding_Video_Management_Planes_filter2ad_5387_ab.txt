video delivery.
Prior industry reports have explored related aspects of video
management planes [13, 18, 22, 37, 41] (see ¬ß7 for details). These
studies have four shortcomings that we address in this paper. First,
they lack a publisher-centric focus, even though publishers make
video management decisions. As a simple example, these studies
do not reveal how many streaming protocols or how many CDNs a
publisher uses, but these factors affect management complexity (¬ß5).
Second, these studies do not contextualize their results. For example,
consider a finding that few publishers use DASH. If these publishers
are large, they are more likely to drive adoption of DASH than if

they are all small publishers. Third, most studies were one-off, but
the video landscape is continuously evolving. Longitudinal trends
can help understand how the video delivery ecosystem is likely to
evolve in the short to medium term. Fourth, in part because they
lack a publisher-centric focus, these studies do not shed light on a
common practice in video delivery, content syndication (¬ß6).
Extracting management plane practices from streaming analyt-
ics dataset. We use data from Conviva [9], a streaming TV measure-
ment and intelligence platform. Conviva provides various services
such as monitoring playback quality and dynamic selection of CDNs.
To enable these services, Conviva provides a monitoring library
which publishers integrate with their video players. The monitoring
library reports per-view information to Conviva‚Äôs backend which
collects data from different devices including desktops, mobiles, and
smart TVs.
Our dataset spans 27 months (January 2016 to March 2018) and
contains over 100 billion views. For each view, we have access to
an anonymized publisher ID, a URL which uses an anonymized
video ID but retains the manifest file extension, device model (e.g.,
iPhone, Roku); the operating system (e.g., iOS, Android); HTTP
user-agent (for browser views) or SDK and SDK version number
(for app views); the CDN(s) that were used to deliver the content;4
the set of available bitrates for adaptation; viewing time; and delivery
performance (average bitrate and rebuffering time).
From this data, we can extract, for any given time window (e.g.,
a month), and for each publisher: which CDNs the publisher uses,
and which devices the publisher‚Äôs content was viewed on. We also
infer which streaming protocols a publisher uses by examining the
manifest file extension. Different streaming protocols use pre-defined
file extension types for their manifest files (Tab. 1): for example,
HLS manifest files typically use the .m3u8 file extension5.
For each of these dimensions, we can associate three measures
that can help contextualize the dimension. Our primary measure, and
one used most often in the video industry [20, 23, 35], is the number
of view-hours (i.e., the total viewing time in terms of hours). Using
our data, we can examine, for example, the number of view-hours
of a publisher‚Äôs content delivered from a given CDN, over HLS,
to iPhones. In some of our analysis, we use the number of views
associated with a particular dimension (e.g., the number of video
plays delivered to Roku players). This is helpful to understand if
view-hours were accumulated from a few long video views or many
short video views. In some analyses, we also measure importance by
the number of distinct videos IDs. We do not have this data for all
our publishers, so when we use this measure, it is an under-estimate.
Dataset limitations. Our dataset does not include the 3 largest
video publishers: YouTube, Netflix and Facebook. However, where

5There are two exceptions to this. RTMP can be detected from the protocol spec-
ification in the URL (RTMP instead of HTTP). Progressive downloading uses file
extensions corresponding to video encodings, like .mp4 or .flv.

possible we use published reports on these large services to contextu-
alize the findings in our study. The dataset also does not include data
necessary to investigate three aspects of video management: Digi-
tal Rights Management (DRM) usage, monetization, and encoding
format.
Macroscopic context. Video consumption today is dominated by
YouTube, Facebook, and Netflix, which contributed (according to
2016/2017 studies [21, 30]) 1 billion, 0.1 billion and 0.14 billion
view-hours per day respectively. Beyond these three, there are a large
number of video publishers that deliver online content. Our March
2018 dataset comprises of more than one hundred publishers. Across
all our publishers, the aggregate daily view-hours is 0.06 billion per
day, comparable to Facebook and Netflix in 2016 and 2017. Finally,
the publishers in our study together serve 180 countries.
4 CHARACTERIZING VIDEO
MANAGEMENT PLANES
We characterize video management planes along three dimensions:
packaging, measured by the streaming protocols used; content distri-
bution, measured by the CDNs used; and device playback, measured
by types of devices and number of application frameworks. For each
dimension ùëë, we ask:
‚àô How has ùëë evolved across publishers?
‚àô How has ùëë evolved in terms of view-hours? For example, does a
dominant practice result from a few big publishers or many small
publishers?
‚àô What is the distribution across publishers of number of instances
of ùëë? Is it correlated with publisher view-hours?
Our two-year dataset is too large to process every view, so we use
a sequence of two-day snapshots taken bi-weekly. We use the last
snapshot, taken in March 2018, for the third question.
4.1 Packaging
Understanding the prevalence of different streaming protocols is
important for several reasons. First, the amount of work/resource
needed to package content is proportional to the number of streaming
protocols supported by a publisher. Also the time taken to package
content can add delay to live content distribution. Second, in some
cases, support for a streaming protocol can directly impact the set of
devices that can be supported: e.g., until recently publishers needed
to support HLS to work with Apple devices (¬ß2).
Prevalence by streaming protocol. Streaming protocols include
HTTP-based protocols as well as RTMP, a protocol for low latency
video streaming services [14, 75, 78]. In our dataset, RTMP only
accounted for 1.6% of the view-hours in January 2016 and 0.1% in
March 2018. RTMP has compatibility issues with network middle-
boxes, scalability limitations [75, 78], and limited device support.
For these reasons, our publishers prefer HTTP-based streaming
protocols even though these protocols may add a few seconds of en-
coding and packaging delay to live streams. The rest of our analysis
focuses on HTTP-based protocols.
Across publishers. Fig. 2(a) shows the percentage of publishers
that supported a given streaming protocol over time (the sum of
percentages at any given point in time exceeds 100% because
publishers can support multiple protocols). The rightmost point
of each curve indicates the latest snapshot. In this latest snapshot,
91% of publishers support HLS, likely because many devices and
players support it [17, 25, 30]. DASH and SmoothStreaming are
currently supported by around 40% of publishers, but HDS is
only supported by 19% of the publishers. Over time, support for
DASH has increased from 10% of publishers to 43%, corroborating
a recent survey of video developers [41]. HDS has steadily lost
support. The growth of DASH has not been at the expense of HLS or
SmoothStreaming. Over time, HLS and SmoothStreaming support
across publishers has remained steady.
By view-hours. We can quantify usage of streaming protocols
in terms of view-hours, unlike existing industry surveys [13, 41].
Fig. 2(b) shows the percentage of view-hours served by different
protocols over time. In our latest snapshot, HLS and DASH are
dominant, each accounting for about 38-45% of the view-hours,
with the other two being relatively small. Longitudinally, the most
noticeable trend is the growth in use for DASH from 3% to 38%
view-hours. We found that this is due to ùëÅ large publishers in
our dataset (where ùëÅ is small and exact number is not provided
for privacy concerns). This increase in DASH support noticeably
reduces the fraction of view-hours attributable to the other protocols.
When we remove these publishers (Fig. 2(c)), we observe that
DASH support from other publishers only accounts for less than
5% of view-hours overall. To explain this further, Fig. 4 shows
the distribution across publishers of the percentage of view-hours
that used a given protocol, only considering publishers that support
that protocol. Even though 40% of the publishers support DASH
(Fig. 2(a)), half of them employ it for at most 20% of their view-
hours (Fig. 4). In contrast, among the 90% of publishers that support
HLS, half use it for at least 85% of their view-hours.
Number of protocols per publisher. Fig. 3(a) explores how many
streaming protocols each publisher supports in the latest snapshot.
Each group of bars corresponds to a given number of protocols
ùëõ and shows the percentage of publishers that used ùëõ protocols
(left) and the percentage of view-hours from publishers that used ùëõ
protocols (right). While 38% of publishers support 1 protocol, these
publishers account for less than 10% of view-hours. The use of 2
protocols is dominant (38% of publishers, accounting for nearly 60%
of view-hours), and the use of 3 protocols is also significant.
Fig. 3(b) presents the number of protocols used by publishers
when bucketed by their view-hours. The left most bar corresponds
to publishers with ùëã view-hours or less (we do not specify ùëã for
confidentiality reasons). The second bar corresponds to publishers
with ùëã to 10ùëã daily view-hours, the next bar to publishers with
10ùëã to 100ùëã view-hours, and so on. Each bar corresponds to the
percentage of publishers in a given bucket, broken down by the
number of protocols used by the publishers. The tallest bar indicates
that (i) over 35% of publishers have 100X to 1000X daily view-
hours; and (ii) publishers in this bucket use from 1 to 4 protocols.
Outside of publishers in the bucket with the least view-hours, more
than 50% of publishers in all buckets use at least 2 protocols, with
all publishers in the 104ùëã ‚àí 105ùëã bucket (right-most bar) using
2 protocols. A significant number of publishers in the intermediate
buckets use 3 or 4 protocols.

Fig. 3(c) shows changes in the number of protocols used over time.
The lower curve shows the number of protocols averaged across pub-
lishers. The upper curve is the average weighted by the publisher‚Äôs
view-hours. The weighted average is always higher, indicating larger
publishers tend to use more protocols. Despite fluctuations, the av-
erage number of protocols has remained a bit below two, and the
weighted average higher than two. This consistency is likely because
the growth in DASH has coincided with the decline of HDS.
4.2 Device Playback
Understanding the set of user devices that a publisher supports is
important because (i) implementing and maintaining video players

Figure 5: Target platforms for video publishers
for a range of platforms requires significant effort; and (ii) the popu-
larity of a platform can impact the publisher‚Äôs decision of whether
to support it.
Prevalence by platform. Video is consumed (Fig. 5) on a variety
of devices which can broadly be classified into two platform types:
browsers and apps. Video is consumed on desktops, laptops, tablets
and mobile devices using browsers on these devices. Video is also
consumed using apps on mobile devices, smart TVs, streaming set-
top boxes (we use the term set-top boxes to refer to streaming set-top
boxes (¬ß1)) and gaming consoles. We differentiate between set-top
boxes and smart TVs for two reasons. First, we find that set-top
boxes often require their own specific software development kits
for application development [3, 7]. Second, set-top box usage is
not necessarily limited to non-smart TVs. In fact set-top boxes may
also be used with smart TVs, for example, to augment the range of
available content, so it is important to distinguish between the two.

We now explore the prevalence of video consumption across
these 4 app-based platform categories, and across browsers (which
includes browser usage on mobile devices6).
Across Publishers. Fig. 7 shows that, over the 27 month period,
support has grown most significantly for set-top boxes and smart TVs
(from under 20% of publishers to above 50% and 60% of publishers
respectively today). Complementary to this growth, it is interesting to
note that YouTube, which has traditionally focused on browsers and
mobile devices [8], also recently released an application to support
large screen devices such as Samsung smart TV and Apple‚Äôs tvOS
set-top box [34]. This shows that video publishers in general are
now paying great attention towards supporting large screen devices.
Finally, we also observe that there has also been growth in mobile
