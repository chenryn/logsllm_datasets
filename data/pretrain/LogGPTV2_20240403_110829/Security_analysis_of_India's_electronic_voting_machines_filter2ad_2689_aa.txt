ABSTRACT
Elections in India are conducted almost exclusively using elec-
tronic voting machines developed over the past two decades
by a pair of government-owned companies. These devices,
known in India as EVMs, have been praised for their simple
design, ease of use, and reliability, but recently they have
also been criticized following widespread reports of election
irregularities. Despite this criticism, many details of the ma-
chines’ design have never been publicly disclosed, and they
have not been subjected to a rigorous, independent security
evaluation. In this paper, we present a security analysis of a
real Indian EVM obtained from an anonymous source. We
describe the machine’s design and operation in detail, and we
evaluate its security in light of relevant election procedures.
We conclude that in spite of the machines’ simplicity and
minimal software trusted computing base, they are vulner-
able to serious attacks that can alter election results and
violate the secrecy of the ballot. We demonstrate two at-
tacks, implemented using custom hardware, which could be
carried out by dishonest election insiders or other criminals
with only brief physical access to the machines. This case
study carries important lessons for Indian elections and for
electronic voting security more generally.

INTRODUCTION
India is the world’s largest democracy. In recent national
elections, more votes were cast than the combined popu-
lation of the United States and Canada [57], and the vast
majority of voters used paperless direct-recording electronic
(DRE) voting machines [25]. Though paperless DREs have
been largely discredited in the academic security literature
(e.g., [4, 5, 9, 10, 17, 29, 30, 38]), Indian election authorities

continue to insist that the electronic voting machines used
in India, widely referred to as EVMs, are fully secure. For
example, the Election Commission of India, the country’s
highest election authority, asserted in an August 2009 press
statement: “Today, the Commission once again completely
reaﬃrms its faith in the infallibility of the EVMs. These
are fully tamper-proof, as ever” [27]. As recently as April
26, 2010, Chief Election Commissioner Navin B. Chawla
was quoted in the media as saying the machines were “per-
fect” with no need for “technological improvement” [48]. To
justify these claims, oﬃcials frequently cite the design of
the EVMs, which is vastly simpler than that of most other
DREs used globally, and a number of procedural safeguards.
However, the details of the machines’ design have been a
closely guarded secret, and, until now, they have never been
subjected to a rigorous independent security review.
In this paper, we analyze the security of India’s EVMs
and related procedural safeguards. We show that while the
machines’ simplicity makes them less susceptible to some of
the threats faced by DREs studied in prior work, it also sub-
jects them to a diﬀerent set of highly dangerous attacks. We
demonstrate two attacks that involve physically tampering
with the EVMs’ hardware. First, we show how dishonest
election insiders or other criminals could alter election results
1by replacing parts of the machines with malicious look-alike
components. Such attacks are made far simpler and cheaper
by the EVMs’ minimalist design, and they could be accom-
plished without the involvement of any ﬁeld-level poll oﬃcials.
Second, we show how attackers could use portable hardware
devices to extract and alter the vote records stored in the
machines’ memory, allowing them to change election out-
comes and violate ballot secrecy. This attack is technically
straightforward because the EVMs do not use even basic
cryptography to protect vote data internally. It could be car-
ried out by local election oﬃcials without being detected by
the national authorities or the EVM manufacturers’ agents.
Though EVM manufacturers and election oﬃcials have at-
tempted to keep the design of the EVMs secret, this presents
only a minor obstacle for would-be attackers. There are
nearly 1.4 million EVMs in use throughout the country [26],
and criminals would only need access to one of them to de-
velop working attacks. Dishonest insiders or other criminals
would likely face less diﬃculty than we did in obtaining such
access. There are many other possibilities for manipulating
Indian EVMs, both with and without the involvement of
dishonest election insiders. Depending on the local context
and security environment, the nature and scale of potential
manipulations may vary, but neither the machines’ simplicity
nor their secret design keeps them safe.
This study establishes that the EVMs used in India are
not tamper-proof and are susceptible to a range of attacks.
The use of similar paperless DREs has been discontinued in
California [6], Florida [31], Ireland [33], the Netherlands [19],
and Germany [8]. Indian election authorities should immedi-
ately review the security procedures now in place and should
inspect all EVMs for evidence of fraud. Moving forward,
India should adopt a diﬀerent voting system that provides
greater security and transparency.
Research Contributions
1. We present the ﬁrst rigorous, independent security anal-
ysis of the electronic voting system used in India and ﬁnd
signiﬁcant security ﬂaws that compromise the integrity of
the results and the secrecy of the ballot. Indian voting ma-
chines use a vastly diﬀerent design than most other DRE
voting systems studied in the literature, and we describe it
in greater detail than was previously available to the public.
2. We explore the role of simplicity in electronic voting se-
curity. Previous studies have focused on problems caused
by software complexity and have proposed minimizing the
size of the trusted computing base (TCB) as a partial rem-
edy [53]. India’s EVMs use an extremely simple design with
a small software TCB, yet we ﬁnd that this makes physically
tampering with the devices relatively easy. These ﬁndings
underscore that the problems with DREs are due not only
to complexity but also to lack of transparency.
3. We perform the ﬁrst major security study of an electronic
voting system used in an emerging nation. Voting systems
in India must satisfy diﬀerent constraints than systems used
in the United States and Europe, which have been the fo-
cus of research to date. The Indian EVM manufacturers
are exporting machines to other countries, including Nepal,
Bhutan [47], and Bangladesh [40]. Mauritius, Malaysia, Sin-
gapore, Namibia, South Africa and Sri Lanka are reportedly
considering adopting similar systems [47]. We outline some of
the challenges of deploying electronic voting in an emerging
nation. This provides a starting point for future research into
voting system designs that meet the needs of these countries.
Outline The remainder of this paper is organized as fol-
lows.
In Section 2, we review how electronic voting was
introduced in India, describe how EVMs are used in elections,
survey reports of fraud, and describe the EVM hardware
based on our examination and experiments. In Section 3, we
explain a number of ways that the EVM system can be at-
tacked in spite of — and sometimes due to — its simple design.
In Section 4, we present two demonstration attacks that we
developed. Section 5 discusses current procedural counter-
measures and why they are ineﬀective or even harmful. We
place our work within the context of previous electronic vot-
ing security studies in Section 6. Finally, we draw conclusions
and consider the way forward in Section 7.

2. BACKGROUND
2.1 Electronic Voting in India
The Election Commission of India developed the country’s
EVMs in partnership with two government-owned companies,
the Electronics Corporation of India (ECIL) and Bharat Elec-
tronics Limited (BEL) [50, pp. 1,9]. Though these companies
are owned by the Indian government, they are not under the
administrative control of the Election Commission. They are
proﬁt-seeking vendors that are attempting to market EVMs
globally [47].
The ﬁrst Indian EVMs were developed in the early 1980s
by ECIL. They were used in certain parts of the country, but
were never adopted nationwide [50, p. 1]. They introduced
the style of system used to this day (see Figure 1), including
the separate control and ballot units and the layout of both
components. These ﬁrst-generation EVMs were based on
Hitachi 6305 microcontrollers and used ﬁrmware stored in
external UV-erasable PROMs along with 64kb EEPROMs
for storing votes. Second-generation models were introduced
in 2000 by both ECIL and BEL. These machines moved
the ﬁrmware into the CPU and upgraded other components.
They were gradually deployed in greater numbers and used
nationwide beginning in 2004 [50, p. 1]. In 2006, the man-
ufacturers adopted a third-generation design incorporating
additional changes suggested by the Election Commission.
According to Election Commission statistics, there were
1,378,352 EVMs in use in July 2009. Of these, 448,000 were
third-generation machines manufactured from 2006 to 2009,
with 253,400 from BEL and 194,600 from ECIL. The remain-
ing 930,352 were the second-generation models manufactured
from 2000 to 2005, with 440,146 from BEL and 490,206 from
ECIL [26]. (The ﬁrst generation machines are deemed too
risky to use in national elections because their 15-year service
life has expired [1], though they are apparently still used in
certain state and local contests.) In the 2009 parliamentary
election, there were 417,156,494 votes cast, for an average of
302 votes per machine [57].
The EVM we tested is from the largest group, a second-
generation ECIL model. It is a real machine that was manu-
factured in 2003, and it has been used in national elections. It
was provided by a source who has requested to remain anony-
mous. Photographs of the machine and its inner workings

appear throughout this paper. Other types and generations
of machines have certain diﬀerences, but their overall oper-
ation is very similar. We believe that most of our security
analysis is applicable to all EVMs now used in India.
2.2 EVM Operation and Election Procedures
India’s EVMs have two main components, shown in Fig-
ure 1. There is a control unit, used by poll workers, which
stores and accumulates votes, and a ballot unit, located in
the election booth, which is used by voters. These units are
connected by a 5 m cable, which has one end permanently
ﬁxed to the ballot unit. The system is powered by a battery
pack inside the control unit. The EVMs are designed for one-
or two-race elections, as are typical in India; we describe
single-race operation here.
The ballot unit has 16 candidate buttons. If any are unused,
they are covered with a plastic masking tab inside the unit.
When there are more than 16 candidates, an additional ballot
unit can be connected to a port on the underside of the ﬁrst
ballot unit. Up to four ballot units can be chained together
in this way, for a maximum of 64 candidates. A four-position
slide switch under the ballot unit door selects the unit’s
position in the chain.
Election procedures are described in a number of public
documents (e.g., [20]). Prior to the election, workers set up
the ballot unit by attaching a paper label that shows the
names of the candidates and their party symbols (to aid
illiterate voters) next to the candidate buttons. After sealing
the label under a plastic door, workers conﬁgure the number
of candidates using a cand set button on the control unit.
On the morning of the election, poll workers perform a small
mock election to test the machine. They then publicly set
the totals to zero by pressing the clear button, after which
the control unit display shows that a total of zero votes have
been cast. Workers can check this count at any time by
pressing the total button. Seals are then placed on various
parts of the control unit to block access to counting and
clearing functions until later in the election process.
When a voter arrives, workers verify his or her identity
and record the voter’s presence by obtaining a signature
or thumb print. To prevent double voting, they mark the
voter’s right index ﬁnger with indelible ink [39]. Next, a
poll worker presses the ballot button on the control unit
to allow one vote. This causes a green ready light to glow
on the ballot unit. The voter enters the polling booth and
presses the button for the candidate of his or her choice. A
red light next to the candidate button glows, the ready light
turns oﬀ, and the control unit emits a loud beep to indicate
that the vote has been cast. The red light then turns oﬀ
automatically. This process repeats for each voter.
At the end of the poll, the presiding oﬃcer removes a
plastic cap on the control unit and presses the close button,
which prevents the EVM from accepting further votes. The
ballot unit is disconnected and the control unit is placed in
storage until the public count, which may occur weeks later.
On the counting day, the control units are delivered to a
counting center. In public view, an election oﬃcial breaks
a seal on the control unit and presses the result i button,
shown in Figure 2. The display on the control unit shows
a sequence of outputs: the number of candidates, the total
votes, and the number of votes received by each candidate.
Oﬃcials manually record the totals from each machine and
add them together to determine the election result. The
machines are then placed in storage until the next election.
2.3 Challenges for Electronic Voting in India
Indian voting machines must be designed to function under
more challenging environmental conditions and operational
constraints than other electronic voting systems studied in
previous security reviews. These requirements have inﬂu-
enced the simple design of the current machines and impact
our security analysis. Among the challenges are:
Cost With well over a million EVMs in use, the cost of
