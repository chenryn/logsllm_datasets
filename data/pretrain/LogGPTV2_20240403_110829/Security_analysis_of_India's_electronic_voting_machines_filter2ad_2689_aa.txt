## Abstract
Elections in India are predominantly conducted using electronic voting machines (EVMs) developed over the past two decades by government-owned companies. These devices have been praised for their simplicity, ease of use, and reliability. However, they have also faced criticism following reports of election irregularities. Despite this, many details of the EVMs' design have not been publicly disclosed, and they have not undergone a rigorous, independent security evaluation. In this paper, we present a security analysis of a real Indian EVM obtained from an anonymous source. We provide a detailed description of the machine's design and operation and evaluate its security in the context of relevant election procedures. Our analysis reveals that, despite their simplicity and minimal software trusted computing base, the EVMs are vulnerable to serious attacks that can alter election results and violate the secrecy of the ballot. We demonstrate two hardware-based attacks that could be carried out by dishonest insiders or other criminals with brief physical access to the machines. This case study highlights important lessons for Indian elections and electronic voting security more generally.

## 1. Introduction
India is the world's largest democracy. In recent national elections, more votes were cast than the combined population of the United States and Canada, with the vast majority of voters using paperless direct-recording electronic (DRE) voting machines. Although paperless DREs have been widely discredited in academic security literature, Indian election authorities continue to assert that the EVMs used in India are fully secure. For example, the Election Commission of India, the country’s highest election authority, stated in August 2009: “Today, the Commission once again completely reaffirms its faith in the infallibility of the EVMs. These are fully tamper-proof, as ever.” As recently as April 26, 2010, Chief Election Commissioner Navin B. Chawla was quoted as saying the machines were “perfect” with no need for “technological improvement.”

To justify these claims, officials often cite the EVMs' simple design and procedural safeguards. However, the details of the machines' design have been closely guarded, and until now, they have not been subjected to a rigorous, independent security review.

In this paper, we analyze the security of India’s EVMs and related procedural safeguards. We show that while the machines' simplicity makes them less susceptible to some threats, it also subjects them to a different set of highly dangerous attacks. We demonstrate two hardware-based attacks:
1. **Component Replacement Attack:** Dishonest insiders or other criminals could alter election results by replacing parts of the machines with malicious look-alike components. This attack is simplified and made cheaper by the EVMs' minimalist design.
2. **Memory Tampering Attack:** Attackers could use portable hardware devices to extract and alter the vote records stored in the machines’ memory, allowing them to change election outcomes and violate ballot secrecy. This attack is technically straightforward because the EVMs do not use even basic cryptography to protect vote data internally.

Despite attempts to keep the EVM design secret, there are nearly 1.4 million EVMs in use throughout the country, and criminals would only need access to one to develop working attacks. This study establishes that the EVMs used in India are not tamper-proof and are susceptible to a range of attacks. Indian election authorities should immediately review current security procedures, inspect all EVMs for evidence of fraud, and consider adopting a different voting system that provides greater security and transparency.

### Research Contributions
1. **First Independent Security Analysis:** We present the first rigorous, independent security analysis of the electronic voting system used in India, revealing significant security flaws that compromise the integrity of the results and the secrecy of the ballot.
2. **Simplicity and Security:** We explore the role of simplicity in electronic voting security. While previous studies have focused on problems caused by software complexity, our findings show that the EVMs' simple design makes them easy to physically tamper with, underscoring that the problems with DREs are due not only to complexity but also to lack of transparency.
3. **Security Study in Emerging Nations:** We perform the first major security study of an electronic voting system used in an emerging nation, providing insights into the challenges of deploying such systems in countries with different constraints.

## 2. Background

### 2.1 Electronic Voting in India
The Election Commission of India developed the country’s EVMs in partnership with two government-owned companies, the Electronics Corporation of India (ECIL) and Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL). Although these companies are owned by the Indian government, they are not under the administrative control of the Election Commission and are profit-seeking vendors attempting to market EVMs globally.

The first Indian EVMs were developed in the early 1980s by ECIL and were used in certain parts of the country but were never adopted nationwide. They introduced the style of system used to this day, including the separate control and ballot units. These first-generation EVMs were based on Hitachi 6305 microcontrollers and used firmware stored in external UV-erasable PROMs along with 64kb EEPROMs for storing votes. Second-generation models were introduced in 2000 by both ECIL and BEL, moving the firmware into the CPU and upgrading other components. They were gradually deployed in greater numbers and used nationwide beginning in 2004. In 2006, the manufacturers adopted a third-generation design incorporating additional changes suggested by the Election Commission.

According to Election Commission statistics, there were 1,378,352 EVMs in use in July 2009. Of these, 448,000 were third-generation machines manufactured from 2006 to 2009, with 253,400 from BEL and 194,600 from ECIL. The remaining 930,352 were second-generation models manufactured from 2000 to 2005, with 440,146 from BEL and 490,206 from ECIL. The first-generation machines are deemed too risky to use in national elections because their 15-year service life has expired, though they are still used in certain state and local contests. In the 2009 parliamentary election, there were 417,156,494 votes cast, for an average of 302 votes per machine.

The EVM we tested is a second-generation ECIL model, manufactured in 2003 and used in national elections. It was provided by an anonymous source. Photographs of the machine and its inner workings appear throughout this paper. Other types and generations of machines have certain differences, but their overall operation is very similar. We believe that most of our security analysis is applicable to all EVMs now used in India.

### 2.2 EVM Operation and Election Procedures
India’s EVMs have two main components: a control unit, used by poll workers, which stores and accumulates votes, and a ballot unit, located in the election booth, which is used by voters. These units are connected by a 5-meter cable, with one end permanently fixed to the ballot unit. The system is powered by a battery pack inside the control unit. The EVMs are designed for one- or two-race elections, as are typical in India; we describe single-race operation here.

The ballot unit has 16 candidate buttons. If any are unused, they are covered with a plastic masking tab inside the unit. When there are more than 16 candidates, an additional ballot unit can be connected to a port on the underside of the first ballot unit. Up to four ballot units can be chained together, for a maximum of 64 candidates. A four-position slide switch under the ballot unit door selects the unit’s position in the chain.

Election procedures are described in public documents. Prior to the election, workers set up the ballot unit by attaching a paper label that shows the names of the candidates and their party symbols next to the candidate buttons. After sealing the label under a plastic door, workers configure the number of candidates using a "cand set" button on the control unit. On the morning of the election, poll workers perform a small mock election to test the machine. They then publicly set the totals to zero by pressing the "clear" button, after which the control unit display shows that a total of zero votes have been cast. Workers can check this count at any time by pressing the "total" button. Seals are then placed on various parts of the control unit to block access to counting and clearing functions until later in the election process.

When a voter arrives, workers verify their identity and record the voter’s presence by obtaining a signature or thumbprint. To prevent double voting, they mark the voter’s right index finger with indelible ink. Next, a poll worker presses the "ballot" button on the control unit to allow one vote. This causes a green "ready" light to glow on the ballot unit. The voter enters the polling booth and presses the button for the candidate of their choice. A red light next to the candidate button glows, the "ready" light turns off, and the control unit emits a loud beep to indicate that the vote has been cast. The red light then turns off automatically. This process repeats for each voter.

At the end of the poll, the presiding officer removes a plastic cap on the control unit and presses the "close" button, which prevents the EVM from accepting further votes. The ballot unit is disconnected, and the control unit is placed in storage until the public count, which may occur weeks later. On the counting day, the control units are delivered to a counting center. In public view, an election official breaks a seal on the control unit and presses the "result i" button. The display on the control unit shows a sequence of outputs: the number of candidates, the total votes, and the number of votes received by each candidate. Officials manually record the totals from each machine and add them together to determine the election result. The machines are then placed in storage until the next election.

### 2.3 Challenges for Electronic Voting in India
Indian voting machines must be designed to function under more challenging environmental conditions and operational constraints than other electronic voting systems studied in previous security reviews. These requirements have influenced the simple design of the current machines and impact our security analysis. Among the challenges are:

- **Cost:** With well over a million EVMs in use, the cost of manufacturing and maintaining these machines is a significant factor.
- **Environmental Conditions:** The EVMs must operate reliably in diverse and often harsh environments, including extreme temperatures and humidity.
- **Operational Constraints:** The EVMs must be easy to use and maintain, even in areas with limited technical expertise and infrastructure.

These challenges have driven the development of a simple and robust design, but they also introduce unique security vulnerabilities.
