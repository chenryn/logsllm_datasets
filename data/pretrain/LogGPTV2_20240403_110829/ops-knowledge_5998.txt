User: Build an application deployment environment based on Docker technology, including the installation and deployment of Docker, as well as the creation and management of containers
Assistant: 1. Docker installation and deployment a) First, you need to install Docker on the Linux system. The following are the installation steps of Docker on the Ubuntu system: - Enter the following command in the terminal: ``` sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install docker.io ``` - After the installation is successful, please enter the following command to check whether docker is installed Correct installation: ``` sudo docker version ``` b) During the installation of Docker, it will automatically download the latest official image provided by Docker. c) Start the Docker service with the following command: ``` sudo service docker start ``` 2. Create and manage containers a) In Docker, each application is a container. We can create and manage Docker containers through the following commands: - pull image ``` docker pull image name``` - create container ``` docker run -p host_port:container_port -d image name``` Among them, -p parameter Represents port mapping, which maps the container port in the container to the host. -d means running in the background - view the currently running container ``` docker ps ``` - stop the container ``` docker stop container ID ``` - delete the container ``` docker rm container ID ``` b) Configure Docker Image Accelerator - domestic docker images are often limited by the network, so it is often necessary to use domestic accelerators to speed up the pull of docker images. Log in to domestic pull image accelerators such as Alibaba Cloud, Tencent Cloud, NetEase Cloud and other platforms to obtain the address of the docker image accelerator, add the Alibaba Cloud accelerator to the official image configuration file, and replace the content with the corresponding accelerator address: ``` sudo vi /etc/docker/daemon.json ``` Enter the following content: ``` { "registry-mirrors": ["https://Alibaba Cloud accelerator address"] } ``` Save the modified file, and then restart the Docker service That's it. ``` sudo service docker restart ```
