### Agenda
1. Introduction
2. Jailbreaking the SSL VPN
3. Attack Vectors
4. Case Studies & Demos
5. Weaponizing the SSL VPN
6. Recommendations

## Introduction to SSL VPNs
- **Trusted by large corporations** to protect their assets
- **Versatile** and works with any network environments and firewalls
- **Clientless**, a web browser can handle everything

### Why Focus on SSL VPNs?
1. **Critical corporate assets** but often a blind spot
2. **Widely used** by corporations of all sizes
3. **Dominant vendors** in the market
4. **Direct Intranet access** and must be exposed to the outside world
   - Even the NSA hunts for bugs in SSL VPNs, as seen in Equation Group leaks

### Silent Fixes and Forgotten Vulnerabilities
- **Example**: A preAuth RCE on Palo Alto SSL VPN discovered during a Red Team assessment
  - **Silent fix**: No CVE, no advisory, no official announcement
  - **Response from Palo Alto PSIRT**: "We follow coordinated vulnerability disclosure for externally reported issues. Internally found and fixed issues are not CVE'd."

### High Severity CVEs
- **Cisco**: 159
- **F5**: 50
- **Palo Alto**: 26
- **Citrix**: 17
- **Fortinet**: 13
- **Pulse Secure**: 6

### Targeted Vendors
- **Pulse Secure SSL VPN**
  - Over 50,000+ servers operating on the Internet
  - Trusted by large corporations, service providers, and government entities
- **Fortigate SSL VPN**
  - Over 480,000+ servers operating on the Internet
  - Prevalent among medium-sized enterprises

## Hacking SSL VPNs
### Initial Challenges
- **Black box and closed-source appliance**
- **All-in-one architecture** built from scratch
- **Restricted shell access**
- **Jailbreak required** for further research

### Jailbreaking the SSL VPN
- **Virtual Image Analysis**
  - **Typical virtual images**: Enter Single-User mode if no LILO or GRUB password protection
    - Modify filesystem: `/etc/crontab`, `/etc/ld.so.conf`, `/etc/passwd`
  - **Encrypted virtual images**: 
    - Reverse engineering for the win!
    - Memory forensics for the win!

### The Booting Process
- **BIOS -> LILO -> Kernel -> /sbin/init**
- **Vital Point**: `/home/bin/dsconfig.pl`
- **Memory Forensics**: In-memory patching

### Attack Vectors
- **WebVPN**
  - Convenient proxy feature: Portable and clientless
  - Supports various protocols: HTTP, FTP, TELNET, SSH, SMB, RDP
  - Handles various web resources: Websocket, JavaScript, Flash, Java Applet
- **Native Script Language Extensions**
  - En/Decoding in C/C++
  - Type confusion between languages
- **Multi-layered Architecture Problems**
  - Inconsistency between layers
  - Failed patterns: Reverse proxy + Java web, Customized C web server + RESTful API backend

### Case Studies
#### Fortigate SSL VPN
- **Pre-auth RCE chain**
  - **CVE-2018-13379**: Pre-auth arbitrary file reading
  - **CVE-2018-13382**: Post-auth heap overflow
  - **CVE-2018-13383**: Magic backdoor to modify any userâ€™s password
- **Arbitrary File Reading**: Utilize `snprintf` to strip file extensions
- **Heap Overflow Vulnerability**: URL rewriting and JavaScript parsing without length check

#### Pulse Secure SSL VPN
- **Pre-auth RCE chain**
  - **Out-of-box web exploitation**

### Disclaimer
- All mentioned CVEs have been reported and patched by Fortigate and Pulse Secure.

### Conclusion
- **SSL VPNs** are critical but often overlooked.
- **Exploitation** requires deep understanding and creative techniques.
- **Recommendations** for securing SSL VPNs will be provided in the next section.
