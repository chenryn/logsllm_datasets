survey that discusses the latest considerations about the privacy
issues and countermeasures in the genomic era.
However, no existing cryptographic solution in this domain
addresses the challenge of long-term threats to encryption,
such as quantum computing [39], or of the common short-
term threat of brute-force cracking of PBE ciphertexts [40],
[41], [42].
There have been a number of practices of applying de-
ception and decoys in the literature of computer security.
Honeypots [43] are fake computer systems intended to bait
malicious actions that will be tracked and studied once these
systems are probed or compromised. Honeypots are widely
used in intrusion detection system [44], [45], [46]. Similarly,
a honeynet [47] is proposed to assist the system administrator

in identifying malicious trafﬁc on the enterprise network. The
Kamouﬂage system [48] and honeywords [49] are designed
to protect a password vault by constructing plausible decoy
passwords. Juels and Ristenpart [13] formalize such a con-
struction process with the concept of DTE, and propose honey
encryption that provides security beyond the brute-force bound
of password-based encryption.
IX. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
The long-term sensitivity of genomic data gives rise to
a need for especially strong protective mechanisms. Brute-
force attacks on standard encryption schemes under strong
passwords should not be considered infeasible in the long
term, given the rapid evolution of computing technology and
potential algorithmic advances. In the short term, the use of
low-entropy keys, such as passwords, poses serious risks to
password-based encryption of genomic data.
We propose GenoGuard, a cryptographic system that offers
long-term protection for genomic data against even computa-
tionally unbounded adversaries. Decryption attempts against a
GenoGuard ciphertext under an incorrect key yield a genome
sequence that appears statistically plausible even to a so-
phisticated adversary. To achieve this guarantee, GenoGuard
introduces a novel DTE scheme that efﬁciently encodes a
genome sequence on a ternary tree with sensitivity to genetic
recombination and mutation, thereby capturing the highly non-
uniform probability distribution and special structure of ge-
nomic data. GenoGuard additionally provides security against
adversaries with phenotypic side information (physical traits of
victims). We provide a parallelized software implementation
of GenoGuard and demonstrate its efﬁciency and scalability
on a cluster of nodes. GenoGuard thus offers an appealing
approach to the increasingly important challenge of protection
of genomic data.

APPENDIX
THE RECOMBINATION MODEL
Here we describe how to compute the probability of a
haploid genotype hk+1, given k sampled haploid genotypes
{h1,··· , hk} with the forward-backward algorithm for hidden
Markov models. The model is borrowed from genetic research,
but we try to avoid using too much genetic terminology in this
work; for details about some variables and constants we will
use here, we kindly ask the readers to refer to the original
paper [19].
k (x ∈
{1,··· , k}). The transition probability from state j to j + 1 is
characterized by
Initially, at state 1, we have P (X1 = x) = 1
(cid:4)
P (Xj+1 = x(cid:2)|Xj = x)
k ) + 1−exp(− ρj
exp(− ρj

if x(cid:2)
= x;
otherwise,
(9)
where ρj is the genetic distance between locus j and j + 1.
It is computed based on the recombination rate between these
two loci. Intuitively, a smaller genetic distance will make the
two states more likely to take the same value, meaning that
they are more likely to come from the same haploid genotype.
At state j, an allele (0 or 1) will be emitted. To mimic the
effects of mutation, the emitting probability is characterized
by
(cid:6)
P (hk+1,j = a|Xj = x) =
1 − λ if hx,j = a;
λ
otherwise,
(10)
Let
where a is 0 or 1, and λ is the mutation rate.
the forward variable αj(x) = P (hk+1,≤j, Xj =
x). Then α1(x) = P (hk+1,1|X1 = x)P (X1 = x). And
α2(x),··· , αn(x) can be computed recursively using
αj+1(x) =P (hk+1,j+1|Xj+1 = x)
αj(x(cid:2)
)P (Xj+1 = x|Xj = x(cid:2)
),
(11)
k(cid:3)
x(cid:2)
=1
The probability of a complete haploid genotype is then com-
puted using
P (hk+1|h1,··· , hk) =
αn(x).
(12)
k(cid:3)
x=1
The conditional probability for allele j +1, given all preceding
alleles, is computed using
P (hk+1,j+1|hk+1,≤j, h1,··· , hk) =
(cid:5)k
(cid:5)k
(13)
x=1
αj+1(x)
αj(x)
.
x=1
For a genome sequence that couples two haploid genotypes,
the above quantities can be computed similarly by an
all
extension of this hidden Markov model [21].
