User: How to set a new IPv6 address? How are IPv6 addresses assigned on the network?
Assistant: To set up a new IPv6 address: 1. Open the IPv6 settings page on your computer or router. 2. Select the Manual Configuration option. 3. Enter the prefix, which is part of the network address, usually provided by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). 4. Select an address suffix, you can choose by yourself or use an automatically generated address. 5. Click "Save" to save the new IPv6 address. Assigning IPv6 addresses on the network: IPv6 addresses can be assigned through Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCPv6) or Auto-Configuration Protocol (SLAAC). Use DHCPv6: 1. Enable the DHCPv6 server, which can be implemented on a router or server, and assign by broadcasting Ip address requests. 2. The client will receive information from the DHCPv6 server, including the assigned IPv6 address, DNS server, and IPv6 address of the DHCPv6 server. Using SLAAC: 1. The router is configured to broadcast an IPv6 prefix from which the client can derive its own unique IPv6 address. 2. The router will also send a router advertisement message (Router Advertisement, RA), including network prefixes, default gateways, DNS servers, and other information about the LAN. 3. After obtaining the RA information, the client can connect to the network by deriving its own IPv6 address and other information.
