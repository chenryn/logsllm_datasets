User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题I can't log in to Nagios web interface When i try to login to Nagios in my web browser and after having repeatedly enter my login and password on my Nagios page http://127.0.0.1/nagios/, i get this :


  Authorization Required
  
  This server could not verify that you are authorized to access the
  document requested. Either you supplied the wrong credentials (e.g.,
  bad password), or your browser doesn't understand how to supply the
  credentials required. Apache/2.2.15 (Red Hat) Server at 127.0.0.1 Port
  80


I changed the password :

htpasswd -c /etc/nagios/htpasswd.users nagiosadmin


And restart the server :

service httpd restart


But without result !

Assistant: &lt;Directory "/usr/lib/nagios/cgi-bin/"&gt;
   Options ExecCGI
   AllowOverride None
   Order allow,deny
   Allow from all
   AuthName "Nagios Access"
   AuthType Basic
   AuthUserFile /etc/nagios/passwd
   Require valid-user
&lt;/Directory&gt;


You have specified the wrong path for AuthUserFile: it should be /etc/nagios/htpasswd.users instead of /etc/nagios/htpasswd.
