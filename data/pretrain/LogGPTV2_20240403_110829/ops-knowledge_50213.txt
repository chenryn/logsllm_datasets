User: Analyze the process and principle of DNS resolution, how to solve common DNS faults?
Assistant: DNS resolution process 1. The client sends a domain name resolution request to the local domain name server. 2. If the local domain name server has cache data corresponding to the domain name, it will directly return the IP address corresponding to the domain name. 3. If the local domain name server does not have cached data corresponding to the domain name, a query request is sent to the root domain name server. 4. The root domain name server returns the IP address of the top-level domain name server. 5. The local domain name server sends a domain name query request to the top-level domain name server. 6. The top-level domain name server returns the IP address of the second-level domain name server. 7. The local domain name server sends a domain name resolution request to the secondary domain name server. 8. The secondary domain name server returns the IP address corresponding to the domain name. 9. The local domain name server caches the obtained IP address and sends the IP address to the client at the same time. 10. The client sends a request to the IP address to establish a network connection. The principle of DNS resolution DNS resolution is the process of converting domain names into IP addresses. A domain name is a text recognized by humans, while a computer can only recognize IP addresses. The principle of DNS resolution is to resolve the domain name into the corresponding IP address through the DNS server. Inside the DNS server, the correspondence between domain names and IP addresses is stored in a database called DNS cache. When the client initiates a domain name resolution request, the DNS server first checks whether there is corresponding data in the DNS cache, and if there is corresponding data in the cache, it returns the IP address directly; if there is no data in the cache, it needs to perform recursive query, and query upwards , until the corresponding relationship stored in the DNS server is found, and finally the IP address is returned to the client. Solutions to common DNS failures 1. DNS failure: Clear the DNS cache of the local domain name server. 2. DNS attack: Adjust the configuration of the DNS server and add protective measures. 3. DNS pollution: Adjust the settings of the local DNS server and use the public domain name resolution server. 4. The domain name server is down: use a backup domain name server, or manually specify the correspondence between the IP address and the domain name by modifying the local hosts file of the computer. Generally speaking, common DNS failures can be solved by clearing the DNS cache, adjusting the DNS server configuration, and replacing the domain name resolution server.
