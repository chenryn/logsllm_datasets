The magnetic channel uses the magnetic ﬁeld sensors (magne-
tometers or compass) present in most smart phones. Here, the
attacker can place small electromagnets in a crowded area. The
electromagnets can be controlled by a self-contained device, or via
commands transmitted to it from the botmaster over a wireless or
cellular network or text message [46]. The electromagnets are used
to create a variable magnetic ﬁeld. The trigger message can be
encoded within the presence or absence, or a range of threshold
values, of the magnetic ﬁeld strength.
Magnetic ﬁelds dissipate quickly and are inversely proportional
to the cube of the distance between the magnet and the device [15].
Thus, a challenge is to create a magnetic ﬁeld strong enough to be
detected above earth’s natural magnetic ﬁeld (the background ﬁeld).
Generation of such a magnetic ﬁeld is signiﬁcantly difﬁcult and
requires very high electric currents.1
However, the distance issue can be resolved by clever placement
of the magnetic transmitter. For example, the transmitter can be
placed in an elevator of a building or an entrance door frame of a
popular building (a hotspot). In such a scenario, the mobile devices
carried by people who walk past such transmitters can be triggered.
It is also possible for the attacker to physically carry this magnetic
1According to the Biot Savart’s Law [15], it will take a wire carrying
a large amount of current (500 amperes) to generate a magnetic ﬁeld
strength of just 100 microtesla even from a distance of 1 m. A
500 ampere current will be impossible to induce; as a reference, a
current of about 1 ampere can cause electrocution.
device in a pocket or backpack and deliberately walk past users in a
crowded area (such as a subway, mall or a sporting event).
Another scenario where the magnetic channel will prove bene-
ﬁcial to the adversary is the usage of Near Field Communication
(NFC) phones. Here, the adversary can simply hide a magnet on the
NFC readers used for payment transactions. As a user brings his/her
phone close to the readers for making the payment, the phone will
receive the message.
Compared to the audio and light channel, the reachability of the
magnetic channel is a bit limited, and is restricted to triggering
devices in the close vicinity of the magnetic source. However, it
could still be leveraged to deliver messages to a signiﬁcant number
of devices especially in a crowded region or during rush hour. Its
latency is up to the point users come in close physical proximity of
the magnetic source.
A distinctive advantage of the magnetic channel over its coun-
terparts is that it requires no line of sight and can work even when
the devices are stowed inside pockets or purses. In fact, except of
iron and steel, other materials have almost no effect on shielding
magnetic ﬁelds. Another advantage of this channel is that it is least
affected by the background noise (such as that introduced by other
magnetic devices or the Earth’s ﬁeld) as long as a high enough
detection threshold is used.
4.4 Vibrational Channel
In the vibration channel, the transmission is achieved by inducing
vibrations which are then read by a vibration sensor or an accelerom-
eter present on nearby devices. At ﬁrst, it may seem difﬁcult to
induce vibrations to form such channels, but there are (at least) two
possibilities for the attacker. One is to embed the messages as high
bass sounds into a TV or radio program. Assuming that a subwoofer
system is used as the audio transmitter connected to the TV or radio
receiver (as in a home theatre or movie theatre system, for example),
the associated vibrations can travel some distance and reach the
nearby devices. The accelerometer on-board such devices can then
decode the vibration patterns. This is especially true when using
strong sub-woofer systems as well as buttkickers and vibrating seats
already present in many home and movie theatre systems [1].
Another possibility is a peer-to-peer based gossiping channel
whereby a vibrating mobile device transmits messages to a nearby
device, which then vibrates in turn and transmits to its neighbors, and
so on. Such a channel can be formed, for example, in a conference
room where many people share a common surface (table) through
which the vibrations can travel from one device to the other. This
channel is quite feasible and inline with a recent work [34] which
demonstrates that keystrokes on a laptop can be learned via an
accelerometer on a nearby phone.
The subwoofer based TV broadcast channel provides the same
level of coverage and latency as that of the TV based audio chan-
nels. The gossiping based channel, on the other hand, has limited
reachability and relatively high latency due to its proximity require-
ments. However, it is highly undetectable due to its decentralized
propagation. Both of the channels are also naturally imperceptible
to the users. The TV based channels can be explicitly designed to
be steganographic just like the audio.
The range of the TV based channel can be up to several feet,
especially while using vibrating seats. The gossiping based channel
is clearly restricted to a few centimeters. Both of these channels are
affected by the background vibration noise, such as that caused by a
subtle movement of the users themselves. They are also expected to
provide low bandwidth, perhaps less than what is provided by the
audio channels.
4745. DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION
AND EXPERIMENTS
In the previous section, we discussed a wide variety of out-of-
band command and control mechanisms. To demonstrate the fea-
sibility of mobile malware triggered by covert channels, we have
designed and implemented a selected set of these channels. These
are listed below:
• Steganographic audio channel
• Direct (non-steganographic) audio channel
• Ambient light channel
• Magnetic-ﬁeld channel
We have left out the feasibility analysis of vibrational channels
from this paper, given that it is expected to exhibit more or less the
same characteristics as the audio channel. This is an interesting item
for future research, nevertheless.
5.1 Prototype Applications and Test Device
To evaluate the viability of sensor-based covert channels, we de-
veloped a set of applications on the Android 2.3.3 (Gingerbread)
platform. Android provides support for different types of sensors
needed as part of our channels, including the microphone, ambient
light sensor and the magnetometer. We ran the prototype applica-
tions on an HTC Evo 4g smart phone. These applications ran in
the background as Android services. The reported bandwidths in
the following experiments are the maximum bandwidths achieved
under experimental conditions.
5.2 Audio Channel Design
Direct Channel: When implementing the direct audio channel, we
used frequency modulation to encode the messages. The audio sig-
nal was created using a 17 KHz carrier signal. The data transmission
rate of this channel was 1 bit/second.
Steganographic Channel: Audio Signal Embedding: To develop
this channel, we created an embedded signal based on replacing cer-
tain audio frequencies, similarly to the idea introduced by Gopalan
et al [14]. We utilized two frequencies to encode our data: 1500 or
3000 Hz. If the embedded bit value is 0, then the leading frequency
is 1500 Hz, otherwise, it is 3000 Hz. For each bit, the leading fre-
quency power is set to 0.25 of the total frame power. The power of
the other frequency is set to 0.001 of the total frame power. We di-
vided the signal into frames of 0.25 sec each. Each frame is utilized
to embed one bit. To obtain the frequency spectrum of the frame,
we calculate its Fast Frequency Transform (FFT). The frame power
is calculated as the summation of the square values of the absolute
frequency coefﬁcients.
We initially attempted to utilize only one frequency coefﬁcient
to embed each bit. However, this did not produce decodable results.
To improve performance, instead of setting just one frequency com-
ponent (closest to 1500 or 3000 Hz), the 3 frequency components
closest to the leading frequency were set to the appropriate power.
To detect the beginning of the signal, we added at the beginning of
the audio a hail signal. The signal is a perfect sinus at 4500 Hz and
lasts for 0.1 sec.
To decode the signal, we ﬁrst produce a perfect hail signal of 0.1
sec and correlate it to the recorded signal using a 0.1 sec step to
advance. We normalize both the hail signal and the inspected signal
by setting the signal power of each segment to 1. We then calculate
the correlation between the normalized hail signal and the inspected
signal. If the correlation is above a certain threshold, we know we
reached the region of interest. Once the region of interest has been
reached, we further advance to the consecutive segments until the
maximum correlation is achieved. At this point, we reduce the step
size to 0.01 sec and examine the surrounding 0.1 sec around the
found location until the updated maximum correlation is achieved.
At this stage, we decode the rest of the signal. We examine each
0.25 sec stream and calculate the FFT for it. We then calculate
the power in the 3 frequencies closest to the frequencies of interest
(1.5 KHz and 3 KHz). We divide the power of the ﬁrst frequency
coefﬁcients set by the power of the second frequency coefﬁcients
set. If the resulting value is above a certain threshold, the value is
marked as 0; otherwise, it is marked as 1.
Steganographic Channel: Live Stream Embedding: In this sce-
nario, we add a signal which embeds a random bitstring to an
unknown live stream. We create a high-frequency signal for each
“mark” bit (a bit with value 1). We then play this signal together
with the streaming signal and decode the result. We create a hail
frequency with length of 0.1 sec and frequency of 4500 Hz at the
beginning of the signal. For the “mark” bit, we utilize the 20K,
20.1K, 20.2K up to 20.5K frequencies. We create for each of these
frequencies a perfect sinus and add all of them to create a combined
signal of length 0.1 sec. To prevent “stretching” of the signal we
further add a 0.1 sec of break after the mark. For the 0 bit, we leave
a 0.2 seconds break. We play the resulting key audio stream together
with the original stream. We then record the resulting audio and
decode it.
To decode the signal, we ﬁrst detect the hail frequency (in the
same way as in the case of data embedded in a known signal). We
then calculate the FFT for each 0.1 signal segment and add the sum
of frequencies in the 20 - 20.5 KHz. We use a threshold on the sum
to detect the value of each bit.
5.3 Audio Channel Experiments
5.3.1 Direct Channel
We conducted our experiments involving the non-steganographic
or direct channel keeping in mind the various attack scenarios in-
volving the audio channel: TV/radio broadcast, background music
services, IP-TV program, and musical greeting cards (outlined in
Section 4; summarized previously in Table 1). To this end, we
decided to use a pair of low-end computer speakers as our audio
transmitter. (A picture of our experimental set-up appears in Figure
4, moved to the appendix due to the space restrictions). This choice
was made to simulate the transmission of audio from an average lap-
top (e.g., in the case of an IP-TV program), wall-mounted speakers
(in the case of workplace music services), or even a musical greeting
card. When sending audio via a TV set or a home theatre, much
powerful speakers are used in practice. As our experiments below
demonstrate, even with low-grade speakers and low volume levels,
we were able to achieve reasonably long communication ranges.
Indoor Tests: We ﬁrst tested the application inside a room (10 ft by
10 ft), with the phone placed on a desk. In this setting, we found that
we can successfully send the trigger message to the phone without
any data loss (i.e. 0% bit loss) from one side of the room to the other.
This validates that the audio triggers can be effectively transmitted
to phones, via the speakers of a desktop or laptop computer, in a
small personal ofﬁce setting.
Next, we tested the application in the hallway of a building. In
this setting, there were a number of factors introducing environmen-
tal noise, such as people talking, kitchen appliances (hallway was
alongside a kitchen), and air conditioners. We placed the speakers
at one end of the hallway, and the phone at varying distances from
the speakers. Despite the presence of “real” background noise, we
were able to send the trigger message up to 55 feet distance (the
hallway length) with no transmission errors or bit losses, even when
the speaker volume was kept low.
475To evaluate the effect of loud background noise, we next embed-
ded the signal in a music video. We found that even this large noise
introduced by the music video does not affect the transmission rate
nor does it introduce any bit errors, up to the distance we tested (55
feet).
These experiments provide evidence that triggers can be easily
dissipated via the speakers of a TV set even with large viewing
distances, such as at a home, in a movie theatre or a pub with big
TV screens. Given that these speakers under realistic conditions
would be much powerful, the triggers can be sent, if needed, over
much longer distances than the ones we tested. To conclude, the
range of the audio channel can be much higher in practice, contrary
to intuition.
Finally, we evaluated the scenario where the phone is kept inside
a pocket or a purse. We found that the placement of the phone
under two layers of clothing (a T-Shirt wrapped all over the phone,
including its microphone) did not affect the reception of the trigger
message from different distances. The phone was also able to receive
the trigger even inside a purse when tested at a distance of up to 22
feet from the speaker. This suggests that audio triggers can be sent
even when the phones are stowed inside users’ pockets or purses.
This ascertains speciﬁcally the possibility of transmitting triggers
via musical cards in a store. Although we did not test the effect of
keeping the phone inside small leather covers (which some people
do), we believe that such materials might be able to completely
shield the audio signals. In such cases, the triggers may not be
received.
Outdoor Tests: We repeated our experiments outdoors in the pres-
ence of large environmental noise. We used the same set of low-end
speakers to transmit the signal. Despite the large amount of noise
due to passing by vehicles and people, the application was able
to receive the trigger signal at a distance of 45 feet, with no bit
errors. In case of the signal being embedded in a music video, the
transmission range was reduced down to 25 feet.
This test indicates that the audio channel can be quite effective
even in a realistic outdoor environment. Thus, it is not hard to
imagine sending triggers to a large number of phones in a localized
area such as a football stadium.
5.3.2 Steganographic Channels
For evaluating our steganographic channels, we further conducted
some experiments in a ofﬁce room setting. To test our algorithm
for the embedded audio signal channel, we took a sentence from
a wav ﬁle (from a James Bond movie), and used the encoding to
insert a random 24-bit message in it. The audio was then played
and recorded. The signal was decoded successfully and the correct
key was detected. We ran the tests from close distance (using a
laptop’s built-in speaker). We also ran the tests from 3 ft away
using a desktop with a speaker built into its monitor. We found the
detection was successful from both distances. The sampling rate for
the recording was 44.1 kHz. The transmission rate for this channel
was 4 bits per second. The detection accuracy was reduced slightly
when moving to a farther distance, achieving a 92% success rate at
6 ft (22 bits out of 24 bits successful) and 66% detection rate at 8 ft
(16 bits out of 24 bits successful).
In case of the live stream channel, we encoded a random 128 bit
long message. We played both the encoded message and a song in
the background (“at last” by Etta James). Our tests showed that the
entire message was decoded successfully. This channel had a bit
rate of 5 bits per second. This was further tried from distances of 3,
6 and 8 ft, and the message was decoded successfully for all these
distances.
The above result indicate that even steganographic channels can
