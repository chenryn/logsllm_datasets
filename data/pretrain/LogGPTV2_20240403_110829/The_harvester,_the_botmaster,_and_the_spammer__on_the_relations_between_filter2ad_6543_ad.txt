### Campaign Analysis and Spammer Identification

Both campaigns utilized email lists A and B, leading us to conclude that they are associated with the same spammer. Conversely, we identified three distinct Postfix installations, each conducting a separate campaign and using a unique email list. We consider these three servers to be managed by three different spammers.

### Investigation into Email Harvesting Practices

We then explored whether email harvesters collect email addresses to sell them or if spammers themselves perform the harvesting. The hypothesis is that if multiple spammers use the same set of email addresses, those addresses were likely purchased on the black market. Conversely, if a single spammer uses a set of email addresses exclusively, it suggests that the spammer may have harvested the addresses personally.

### Reputation and Customer Loyalty in the Underground Community

Previous research has shown that reputation is crucial for the success of cybercriminals [21]. For instance, an email harvester is more likely to sell their email lists if they are respected in the underground community, and a botmaster is more likely to rent their botnet to spammers if it has a proven track record of delivering spam effectively.

In our experiments, we found evidence supporting this behavior. Spammers appear to maintain long-term relationships with specific email harvesters and botmasters, suggesting a form of customer loyalty. This relationship is resilient and rarely breaks, except in cases of significant events such as botnet takedowns.

### Leveraging Long-Term Usage for Detection

The fact that spammers use the same botnets and email lists over extended periods can be exploited by security researchers for detection. For example, a recently proposed system observes bots as they contact different email servers, effectively fingerprinting the email list being used [23]. By monitoring a small number of known bots, this system can identify additional bots using the same email list. Since spammers use the same email list for long periods, this approach could be highly effective in tracking spambots in the wild. Similarly, spammers who consistently use the same botnet can be detected using techniques that fingerprint the email engine used by such botnets [22].

Moreover, since spammers often rely on a single botnet at a time, taking down the botnet they are using can significantly impact their operations. This makes techniques for identifying command and control (C&C) servers particularly important [4, 7, 26].

### Geographical Concentration of Spambots

The concentration of spambots in a few countries can also aid in detection. Previous research has shown that the geographical distance between spamming bots and their victims is generally greater than the distance between legitimate email senders and recipients [8]. Therefore, spambots concentrated in a few distant countries can serve as a strong indicator for spam detection.

### Absence of Pharmaceutical Spam

Interestingly, we did not observe any pharmaceutical spam sent to the harvested email addresses. This is somewhat surprising, given that much of previous research has focused on spam schemes advertising pharmaceuticals [11, 12]. This discrepancy could be due to measurement artifacts or the decline in pharmaceutical spam over the past two years, as noted in recent reports [24]. Alternatively, large pharmaceutical affiliate programs may harvest their own email addresses and provide them directly to their affiliates, bypassing the need to purchase email lists on the black market.

### Correlation and Future Work

Our findings are based on correlations among the observed behaviors of different actors in the spam chain: the harvester, the botmaster, and the spammer. Despite the correlative nature of our analysis and the limited dataset size, the collected data allows us to observe interesting interactions between these actors. Thus, our work represents a promising first step toward understanding how different parties involved in the spam process cooperate, which ultimately improves our understanding of the online underground economy. We expect additional data to deepen this understanding and plan to expand this preliminary study in future work, moving beyond correlation to establish causal relationships among the different spam actors.

### Related Work

A significant amount of research has been conducted on email spam, focusing on the underground economy and the challenges faced by spammers and botmasters. This research helps in developing new mitigation techniques. Previous studies fall into two main categories: studying the conversion of spam and studying the spam delivery infrastructure.

#### Studying the Conversion of Spam

Research into the conversion of spam aims to understand the extent to which the goods advertised in spam emails are purchased, providing insights into the spam ecosystem and the potential earnings of spammers. For example, Kanich et al. infiltrated the Storm botnet and modified the spam emails to point to a fake pharmaceutical site, allowing them to track the number of users who would have purchased counterfeit goods [11]. In a follow-up study, they analyzed a large rogue pharmaceutical website, estimating the size of the entire spam operation [12].

#### Studying the Spam Delivery Infrastructure

Understanding the spam delivery infrastructure involves examining how different parties operate. Previous work has studied how miscreants collect email addresses on the web [9, 20], revealing the operation of automated harvesters and suggesting simple obfuscation techniques to prevent them from reading email addresses. Research has also been conducted on the C&C infrastructure of spamming botnets and how botmasters manage their bots [21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27].

### Conclusions

In this paper, we analyzed the cooperation among different actors involved in the spam delivery process and the resources shared among them. Our preliminary study suggests that spammers typically rely on professional email harvesters to populate their email lists and usually rent a single botnet rather than using multiple ones simultaneously. This work is a first step in understanding how spammers operate and the dynamics of the underground economy. We hope that the insights provided will help researchers identify weak points in the spam delivery chain and develop better mitigation techniques.
