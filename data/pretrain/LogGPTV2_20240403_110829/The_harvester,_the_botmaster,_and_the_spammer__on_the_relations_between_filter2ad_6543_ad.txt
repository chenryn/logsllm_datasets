both campaigns used the email lists A and B. Therefore, we
associate them to the same spammer. On the other hand, we
identiﬁed three diﬀerent installations of Postﬁx, each carry-
ing out a diﬀerent campaign, and each one using a diﬀerent
email list. We consider these three servers as being managed
by three diﬀerent spammers.
We next investigated whether email harvesters collect email
addresses to sell them, or whether spammers are doing the
harvesting themselves. The intuition here is that if the email

Previous research showed that reputation is key for the
success of a cybercriminal [21]. For example, an email har-
vester is more likely to sell his email lists if he is a respected
member of the underground community, and a botmaster is
more likely to rent his botnet to spammers if he has proven
that his botnet works well in delivering spam.
In the ex-
periments performed for this paper, we found evidence of
this behavior. Spammers seem to stick with the same email
harvesters, as well as with the same botnets, for long pe-
riods of time. This suggests that spammers establish some
sort of customer loyalty with harvesters and botmasters, and
that this relationship hardly breaks (in the absence of major
events, such as botnet takedowns).
The fact that spammers are using the same botnet and
email list for long periods of time can be leveraged by secu-
rity researchers for detection. For example, a system that
was recently proposed observes bots as they contact diﬀerent
email servers, in practice ﬁngerprinting the email list that
the bots are using [23]. By observing a small number of bots
that are known to belong to a botnet, this system is able to
ﬁnd more bots that use the same email list. Since spam-
mers use the same email list for long periods of time, this
approach could prove to be a very eﬀective method to track
spambots in the wild. Similarly, spammers that keep using
the same botnet can be eﬀectively detected by techniques
that ﬁngerprint the email engine used by such botnets [22].
Moreover, since spammers seem to rely on a single botnet
at a time, taking down the botnet that they are using can
have signiﬁcant eﬀects on their business. This observation
makes techniques that identify command and control servers
particularly important [4, 7, 26].
The fact that spammers concentrate their bots in a small
number of countries could further help in the detection. Pre-
vious research showed that the geographical distance be-
tween spamming bots and their victims is higher on aver-
age than the distance between legitimate email senders and
recipients [8]. Similarly, having spambots that are concen-
trated in few far countries can be used as a strong indicator
for a mailserver performing spam detection.
As we said previously, we did not observe any pharmaceu-
tical spam sent to the email addresses that were harvested.
This is somewhat surprising, since much of previous research
focused on studying spam schemes that advertise pharma-
ceuticals [11, 12]. Besides being caused by measurement ar-
tifacts, another reason for this discrepancy might be that
pharmaceutical spam has been steadily declining over the
last two years, as recent reports noted [24]. Alternatively,
it could be that large pharmaceutical aﬃliate programs har-
vest their own email addresses, and that they directly pro-
vide them to their aﬃliates, who do not have to look for
email lists on the black market.
Note that our ﬁndings are based on correlations among the
observed behavior of diﬀerent actors in the spam chain—the
harvester, the botmaster, and the spammer. Despite the cor-
relative nature of our analysis and the limited dataset size,
the collected data enables us to observe interesting inter-
actions between the diﬀerent actors in the spam landscape.
Thus, we see our work as a promising ﬁrst step toward under-
standing how diﬀerent parties involved in the spam process
cooperate, which ultimately improves our understanding of
the online underground economy. We expect additional data
to deepen this understanding and plan to expand this pre-

addresses collected by a harvester are used by multiple spam-
mers, they have likely been purchased on the black market.
On the other hand, if a spammer is using a set of email
addresses exclusively, he might have harvested them him-
self. Our ﬁndings lead us to speculate that harvesters C
and D are likely to be ran by professional harvesters, who
are selling their email lists on the black market. This is
supported by the fact that multiple spammers used them
for their spamming operations: the email list harvested by
harvester C was used by spammers that rented Kelihos, My-
doom, Postﬁx, and Sendmail. Similarly, the email list sold
by harvester D was used by Lethic, Mydoom, and Post-
ﬁx users. The fact that multiple spammers purchased these
email lists suggests that these harvesters are successfully col-
lecting email addresses and advertising their email list. This
is further supported by the fact that harvester C is the one
with the largest infrastructure among the logged one (56 IP
addresses), and that harvester D was the most successful
one, with 415 harvested email addresses. It is also interest-
ing that the ﬁrst spam email that was received by one of the
email addresses harvested by D arrived after ﬁve days from
the harvesting (see Table 3). This shows that the operators
of D are very eﬃcient in harvesting email addresses and sell-
ing them on the black market. The operators of harvester
B probably also sold their email list, since it has been used
by both Cutwail and Postﬁx.
The emails harvested by two harvesters were used only by
a single spammer (E, H). This might suggest that in these
cases the spammers and the harvesters are the same entity,
and are using the email addresses that they harvested exclu-
sively for launching their spam campaigns. This intuition is
supported by the fact that one of the Postﬁx installations
was located in the same country as harvester H, which col-
lected the email addresses used by that server (Spain). In-
terestingly, the email addresses collected by harvester I were
not used by any spam setup.

beyond our correlation analysis to establishing causal rela-
tionships among the diﬀerent spam actors.
5. RELATED WORK
A wealth of research has been conducted on email spam.
By studying the underground economy surrounding spam,
as well as the challenges that spammers and botmasters face,
researchers can develop new mitigation techniques that at-
tackers cannot easily evade. Previous research falls in two
main ﬁelds: Studying the conversion of spam and Studying
the spam delivery infrastructure.
Studying the conversion of spam. Studying to what ex-
tent the goods advertised in spam emails are purchased helps
in dimensioning the spam ecosystem, and in understanding
how much money spammers can make. Kanich et al. inﬁl-
trated the Storm botnet, and modiﬁed the spam emails sent
by the botnet to point to their fake pharmaceutical site [11].
This way, they were able to track the number of users that
would have purchased the counterfeit goods. In a follow-up
work, Kanich et al. studied a large rogue pharmaceutical
website [12]. By leveraging a vulnerability in the website
that allowed to enumerate any order that was made, they
estimated the size of the whole spam operation. Levchenko
et al. studied the workﬂow of spam-advertised goods, from
when a good is purchased, to when it is delivered to the cus-
tomer [15]. They were able to identify the ﬁnancial institu-
tions involved in transactions related to the spam business.
Although studying the economic conversion of spam is very
important, it goes beyond the scope of this paper. Instead,
we look at how the diﬀerent entities operating in the spam
delivery business operate and are related.
Studying the spam delivery infrastructure. When
studying the spam delivery infrastructure, it is important
to understand how the diﬀerent parties involved in it op-
erate. Previous work studied how miscreants collect email
addresses on the web [9,20]. This research showed how auto-
mated harvesters operated, and suggested some simple ob-
fuscation techniques that can prevent them to read email
address, while still making them intelligible to humans.
A wealth of research has been conducted in studying the
command and control (C&C) infrastructure of spamming
botnets, and how botmasters manage their bots. Stone-
Gross et al. analyzed a number of C&C servers from the
Cutwail botnet, studying how spammers used them, and
the challenges that they had to face [21]. Cho et al.
inﬁl-
trated the MegaD botnet, providing interesting insights on
how a large-scale botnet operates. A number of inﬁltration
operations have been performed against peer-to-peer bot-
nets, showing how these botnets work, and the type of spam
that they send [13, 18].
Another interesting aspect is understanding how miscre-
ants purchase infected machines. Caballero et al. [3] showed
that there are complex schemes, made of malware-delivery
networks that can download the payload that is required by
customers on a large number of infected machines.
Although previous research suggested that there is a rich
underground economy trading all the components required
to set up a successful spam campaign (email lists, botnets,
and malware installations) [21], no work actually studied
these dynamics. Our paper provides a ﬁrst look at this
phenomenon, focusing on the relations between email har-
vesters, botnets, and spammers.
6. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we analyzed how the diﬀerent actors in-
volved in the spam delivery process cooperate, and what
type of resources are shared among them. Our preliminary
study suggests that spammers typically rely on a number of
professional email harvesters to populate their email lists.
Also, our ﬁndings suggest that spammers typically rent a
single botnet, instead of using multiple ones at the same
time. This work is a ﬁrst step in understanding how spam-
mers operate, and how the underground economy landscape
look like. We hope that the insights provided in this pa-
per will help researchers in ﬁnding the weak points in the
spam delivery chain, and in developing better mitigation
techniques.
