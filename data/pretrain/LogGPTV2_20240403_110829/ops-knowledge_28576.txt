User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Facebook Knows About my Search History in Other Browsers I use a private IE window to browse facebook (theoretically no data stored locally). I log in to facebook maybe once every 6 months.

Two months ago, I used Chrome on the same machine to search for Dell computers, a specific model. 

Both searches were done on the same network.

I logged in to facebook today, and lo and behold, ads for that specific Dell model (far too specific to be random). How did facebook get this information? Is my internet provider selling all my search history? Is there some other mechanism that I don't know? I thought browser data was isolated.

Assistant: The answer to your question is "Super cookies"
The trick is about HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) for something it wasn't intended for. HSTS is a modern web feature that allows a website to tell a browser it should only connect to the site over an encrypted connection.  


Which makes the cookies for that website work even when you're in icognito mode.

This Answer is for your question 


  "Is there some other mechanism that I don't know?"



But regarding your ISP, I think things are more terrible than storing a cookie :D
And about your question: 


  "How did facebook get this information?"


The Method i Told you about. And never forget that facebook stores the search history in their database, so that also may be used in advertisements so make that in mind too.
