in which only one player cooperates, we immediately have
the following theorem.
Theorem 2. The n-player pseudonym change C-game has
at least 1 and at most 2 pure-strategy Nash equilibria.
To illustrate the above results, we consider the set of all
possible strategy proﬁles in a 3-player C-game. Assume that
N = 10, the payoﬀ of each Pi before playing the game is
in the interval [0, log2(10)− γ], depending on the number of
nodes that have cooperated with Pi in the past (at T (cid:96)
i ) as
well as the number of failed attempts and the rate of privacy
loss. The set of all strategy proﬁles of this 3-player C-game
is: s = {(s1, s2, s3)|si ∈ {C, D}}.
Lemma 1 proves that (D, D, D) is always a NE. From
Lemma 2, (C, D, D), (D, D, C), and (D, C, D) are not NE,
because |C k∗| must be strictly larger than 1 to satisfy
log2(|C k∗|) − γ > u
−
i . Among the remaining strategy
proﬁles, there might be a single NE as deﬁned by Lemma 2.
The existence of this equilibrium depends on the payoﬀ of
each player. Assume that P3 cooperated with 6 nodes at
3 and its payoﬀ is log2(7) − γ − β3 − γα3 that is bigger
T (cid:96)
than log2(2)− γ before playing the game. Consider that the
payoﬀ of P1 and P2 is less than log2(2) − γ before playing
the game. Then, the NE strategy proﬁle is (C, C, D),
corresponding to |C k∗| = 2.
6.3 Discussion
In C-games, each mobile node tries to reduce its consump-
tion of pseudonyms by changing pseudonyms: (i) only when

necessary (i.e., low user-centric location privacy level) and
(ii) when the other encountered nodes are willing to cooper-
ate as well. In the 2-player C-game, we prove the existence
of two pure and one mixed NE. The payoﬀ to both players
in (C,C) is higher than in all other outcomes of the game
and thus (C,C) is pareto-optimal. Because the payoﬀs in the
n-player scenario are more asymmetric than those of the 2-
player game (i.e., with a larger diﬀerence across players), a
NE with cooperation does not always exist. Still, the All
Defection equilibrium always exists because one player can-
not gain by cooperating alone. Moreover, it can be easily
proved that the NE with cooperation is Pareto-optimal, if it
exists.
7. ANALYSIS OF INCOMPLETE INFOR-
MATION GAME
In this section, we consider games of incomplete informa-
tion, which we call I-games (I stands for incomplete infor-
mation): the players do not know the payoﬀ type of their
opponents. The incomplete information assumption better
models the knowledge of mobile nodes. The proofs are pro-
vided in the Appendix.
7.1 Threshold Equilibrium
In an I-game, players decide their move based on their
belief about their opponent’s type. Recall that a player’s
type is deﬁned as θi = Ai−βi−γαi−γ; this deﬁnes the payoﬀ
immediately before the game. We establish an equilibrium
in which each player adopts a strategy based on a threshold:
if the type of a player is above a threshold ˜θi, it defects,
otherwise it cooperates. Hence, the space of types is divided
into two regions (Figure 4). A player that has 0 ≤ θi ≤ ˜θi
always cooperates, whereas a player with ˜θi  0 for all θi ∈ [0, 1 − γ].
Theorem 3. The 2-player pseudonym change I-game
has All Cooperate and All Defect pure-strategy Bayesian-
Nash equilibrium, and every threshold equilibrium s∗ =

In simulations we ﬁnd an intermediate, symmetric thresh-
old equilibrium in almost all cases, where players don’t sim-
ply always cooperate or always defect.3
2 ) is symmetric for continuous type distributions.
To illustrate the results of the theorem we consider the
following example. Consider that the distribution on types
is uniform, with θi ∼ U (0, 1−γ), and cumulative probability
function F (θi) = θi/(1−γ). Looking for an equilibrium with
i ≥ γ, so that the max(0,·) term in deﬁning

the payoﬀ of the cooperation action can be dropped, we can
simplify Eq. (16) and obtain the system of equations:

2 )) · 0 = ˜θ∗
1 = ˜θ∗
We numerically solve Eq. (16) to ﬁnd symmetric thresh-
old equilibrium for three diﬀerent probability distributions
(using fsolve() in Matlab). We consider the beta distribu-
tion B(a, b), a family of continuous probability distributions
deﬁned on the interval [0, 1] and parameterized by two pos-
itive shape parameters a and b. If θ ∼ B(2, 5), nodes have a
small θ with a high probability (i.e., long-tail distribution),
whereas with θ ∼ B(5, 2), nodes have a large θ with a high
probability. If θ ∼ B(2, 2), θ is symmetric and centralized
around 0.5. Figure 5 shows the BNE ˜θ∗
i and the related
probability of cooperation F (˜θ∗
i ) as a function of the cost
γ. For each distribution of type, we obtain three BNE: ˜θ∗
i,1
is an All Defection equilibrium, ˜θ∗
i,2 is an intermediate equi-
librium, and ˜θ∗
i,3 is an All Cooperation equilibrium. With
the BNE ˜θ∗
i,3, nodes always play the same strategy.
With ˜θ∗
i,2, we observe that as γ increases, the probability of
cooperation F (˜θ∗
i,2) increases as well, indicating that players
should cooperate more when the cost of changing pseudo-
nyms increases. In other words, with a high γ, users care
more about the coordination success with others.
If γ is
small, then the cooperation success becomes less important
and nodes become selﬁsh.
The probability of cooperation also depends on the type of
Beta distribution. With a lower type distributions B(2, 5),
the probability of cooperation at equilibrium is smaller than
other distribution types. In other words, selﬁsh nodes coop-
erate less because whenever they must change pseudonym,
they know that the majority of their neighbors also needs
to change pseudonym. On the contrary, for B(5, 2), selﬁsh
nodes cooperate more to maintain high privacy.

In considering the welfare achieved in the pseudonym
change game, we focus on the performance under the in-
termediate BNE ˜θ∗
i,2. This is more interesting to study than
the All Cooperation or All Defection equilibrium. We sim-
ulate the 2-player I-game in Matlab. The results are aver-

the welfare of the system deﬁned as the average achieved
utility, E[ui] of the nodes; (ii) the fraction of interactions in
which a pseudonym is changed FC; and (iii) the fraction of
successful coordination between nodes, CS (i.e., nodes play
the same action). We compare the BNE performance with
a random strategy, in which all nodes choose their threshold
randomly, and to the socially-optimal strategy, which is All
Cooperation.
We observe that the welfare achieved in the BNE is less
than with the socially-optimal strategy and in general simi-
lar to that of the random strategy. The diﬀerence with the
random strategy is particularly large for B(5, 2) because the
probability of cooperation is then larger than that of the
random strategy. It is informative to consider the ratio of
welfare in the BNE with that at the socially-optimal, by
analogy to the price of anarchy (which considers the perfor-
mance of the worst-case NE [41]). This ratio provides a mea-
