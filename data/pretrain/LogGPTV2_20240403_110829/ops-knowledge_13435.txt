User: Possible duplicate but i couldn't find one.
I've downloaded python and am having trouble loading it into eclipse,
has anyone got a fool proof ground up solution that is garaunteed to work.
This is what i've tried,
Window--preferences--new--specified(Python 32) and C:\
 directory file to python.exe but it keeps spitting out invalid interpreter.
Assistant: My guess is that the problem is that you're probably pointing to a shortcut and not the actual executable, so, can you check if you're really giving the executable (and not a shortcut) in the interpreter configuration process?
If that's not the case, please post details you may have in your error log during that process.
