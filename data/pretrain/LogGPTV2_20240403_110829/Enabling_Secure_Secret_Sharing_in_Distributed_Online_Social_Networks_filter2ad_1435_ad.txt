Figure 2: Inﬂuence of delegate selection algorithms on fL, distribution of pmal =RANDOM, ξ = 0.5 (a,b) and ξ = 1 (c,d)
Considering different adversary distributions: Another
interesting question is how well different delegate selection
algorithms perform under different adversary distributions.
Speciﬁcally, we want to know whether the adversary may
exploit her knowledge of the current delegate selection of
users to focus her attack in a number of well-chosen users
in the system.
Since the delegate selection algorithms FRIENDBASED,
RANDOMWALK, and TRUSTBASED all use connectivity
of users as a selection criteria for a delegate, an adversary
may attempt the following attacks:
• LINKBASED: initially, the adversary tries to control
nodes with higher numbers of links. These nodes are
likely to be chosen by many users as their delegates,
thus controlling these nodes help the adversary to steal
more secrets at a lower cost.
• KEYBASED: the adversary focuses on compromising
nodes currently keeping higher numbers of shares. This
attack is even more powerful, as apparently controlling
these nodes gives the adversary the highest likelihood
of stealing the maximal number of secrets.
We performed various experiments to measure the in-
ﬂuence of the above adversarial attack strategies. Load
intensities are set up as in previous experiments, with varied
numbers of initially malicious users: pmal varied from
small (0.1% to 1%) to larger (1% to 50%). Both cases
of (inf = false or true) are considered, each with two
representative threshold values: ξ = 0.5 and ξ = 1.
Figure 3 shows the performance of different delegate-
selection approaches under the adversary attack using the
LINKBASED distribution. The result is similar to the pre-
vious case. The selection approach TRUSTBASED still
performs either best or comparable to the best approach in
almost all cases. Similar to the previous experiment with ran-
domly distributed adversary, the TRUSTBASED algorithm
performs less well than the FRIENDBASED approach where
there is a very small number of initially malicious users and
the threshold is ξ = 1. The algorithm RANDOMWALK
is not superior in majority of cases we studied. Experi-
ments for the adversary distribution KEYBASED are more
complicated, as they requires detailed time-variant modeling
of distributions of adversarial attacks and the selection of
delegates. This experiment is subject to our future work.
V. RELATED WORK
Applications and usability of threshold cryptography in
P2P and mobile ad hoc networks are discussed in detail by
Saxena et al in [12]. This work mostly focuses on evaluating
computational and communications overhead of different
threshold cryptographical protocols. Security properties of
such protocols under collusive attacks of many malicious
nodes are not discussed.
There are several improvements of the original threshold-
based secret sharing scheme, e.g., produce veriﬁable shares,
change the threshold dynamically, improve the protocol’s
computational and communication efﬁciencies [13]. The
selection of reliable delegates to minimize the inﬂuence
of collusive attacks, however, has not been the focus of
the security research community. Various security solutions
mostly protect secret shares by encrypting these shares with
passwords. These works are complementary to ours, since
we can use any enhanced threshold cryptographical approach
