### Influence of Delegate Selection Algorithms on fL: Analysis and Results

#### Figure 2: Influence of Delegate Selection Algorithms on fL
- **(a) pmal = 0.1% → 1%**
- **(b) pmal = 1% → 50%**
- **(c) pmal = 0.1% → 1%**
- **(d) pmal = 1% → 50%**

**Figure 2** illustrates the impact of different delegate selection algorithms (FRIENDBASED, TRUSTBASED, RANDOMWALK) on the distribution of fL under varying percentages of initially malicious users (pmal). The results are shown for two scenarios: ξ = 0.5 and ξ = 1.0, with both cases of influence (inf = false or true) considered.

#### Analysis of Adversary Distributions

To further understand the performance of these algorithms, we explore how they fare under different adversary distributions:

1. **LINKBASED Attack:**
   - In this strategy, the adversary targets nodes with a higher number of links. These nodes are likely to be chosen as delegates by many users, making them prime targets for maximizing the number of secrets stolen at a lower cost.

2. **KEYBASED Attack:**
   - Here, the adversary focuses on compromising nodes that currently hold a higher number of shares. This approach is particularly potent, as controlling these nodes provides the highest likelihood of stealing the maximum number of secrets.

#### Experimental Setup and Results

We conducted several experiments to measure the impact of these adversarial strategies. The load intensities were set as in previous experiments, with the percentage of initially malicious users (pmal) varying from small (0.1% to 1%) to larger (1% to 50%). Both cases of influence (inf = false or true) were considered, each with two representative threshold values: ξ = 0.5 and ξ = 1.0.

**Figure 3** presents the performance of different delegate-selection approaches under the LINKBASED adversary attack. The results are consistent with the previous findings:
- The TRUSTBASED algorithm generally performs either best or comparably to the best approach in most cases.
- In scenarios with a very small number of initially malicious users and a threshold of ξ = 1.0, the FRIENDBASED approach outperforms TRUSTBASED.
- The RANDOMWALK algorithm does not perform superior in the majority of the cases studied.

Experiments for the KEYBASED adversary distribution are more complex, requiring detailed time-variant modeling of attack distributions and delegate selection. This area is subject to future research.

### Related Work

**Threshold Cryptography in P2P and Mobile Ad Hoc Networks:**
- Saxena et al. [12] provide a detailed discussion on the applications and usability of threshold cryptography in P2P and mobile ad hoc networks. Their work primarily evaluates the computational and communication overheads of different threshold cryptographic protocols but does not address security properties under collusive attacks by multiple malicious nodes.

**Improvements in Threshold-Based Secret Sharing:**
- Various enhancements have been made to the original threshold-based secret sharing scheme, such as producing verifiable shares, dynamically changing the threshold, and improving computational and communication efficiencies [13].
- The selection of reliable delegates to minimize the impact of collusive attacks has not been a primary focus in the security research community. Most security solutions protect secret shares by encrypting them with passwords. These works complement our research, as any enhanced threshold cryptographic approach can be integrated into our framework.

### Conclusion

Our study demonstrates that the TRUSTBASED delegate selection algorithm generally performs well under various adversarial conditions, especially when the percentage of initially malicious users is high. Further research is needed to fully understand the impact of KEYBASED attacks and to develop more robust delegate selection methods.
