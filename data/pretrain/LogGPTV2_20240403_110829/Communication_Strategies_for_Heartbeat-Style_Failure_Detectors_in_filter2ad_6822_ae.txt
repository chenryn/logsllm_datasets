to  a  randomly  generated  direction  and  speed.  The 
direction is uniformly distributed from 0° to 360° and the 
speed  is  from  0  to  a  given  maximum  speed.  The 
maximum  speed  v  is  50  km/hour  in  the  5  ×  5  map,  60 
km/hour in the 6 × 6 map, etc. Each point in these plots is

two 
The  objective  of  the  simulations  was  to  compare  the 
two proposed schemes for gossiping in the wireless ad hoc 
networks;  one  is  the  linear  scheme  (denoted  as  Linear),
and  the  other  is  the  two-phase  scheme  (denoted  as 
TwoPhase).  Traditionally, 
important  criteria  of 
efficiency for a gossiping scheme are the running time and 
the  total  number  of  message  transmissions.  However, 
since in this paper the  gossiping  schemes are designed to 
be  the  base  of  middleware  services  such  as  failure 
detectors,  which  will  keep  working  if  the  overlaying 
system  is  still  in  operation,  the  traditional  concept  of 
running time cannot be applied directly. As a preliminary 
study in this topic, the performance metric to be observed 
in this paper is most basic: the reachability after time t has 
elapsed since  the  gossiping began, it is denoted as RE (t)
and is defined as: 
RE 
=
t
  )(

where  updated_count  (u, t)  is  the  number  of  members  in 
the  hbc_list  of  node  u  that  have  their  heartbeat  counter 
updated  (at  least  once)  before  time  t.  We  use  t  as  the  x-
coordinate  and  the  corresponding  reachability  as  the  y-
coordinate  in  the  Figures  3-10  below.  This  metric  makes 
sense since it basically reflects the average accuracy of a 
failure  detection  service  if  the  detection  time  of  each 
member is set to t.
In  denser  networks, 
First we consider the performance in static topologies. 
Figures 3 - 6 show the comparison of the two schemes in 
networks  with  different  densities.  It  can  be  observed  the 
reachability  degrades  gracefully  due  to  the  effect  of 
message losses in all cases. The reachability curve of the 
linear  scheme  is  smooth,  while  that  of  the  two-phase 
scheme has a ladder-like shape due to the hierarchical way 
of  message  propagation. 
the 
differences  in  performance  of  the  two  schemes  are  quite 
small because the time to achieve a reachability of almost 
100% is usually very short (about 20 - 30 sec in our case). 
However,  as 
two-phase  scheme 
outperforms  the  linear  scheme  more  significantly.  Note 
that it is not required for the failure detection information 
of  each  member  to  be  totally  accurate.  Herein  we  denote 
td as the minimum time (in sec) that the average RE (t) is 
more than 0.9 for t ≥ td. In Figure 4 - 6 it can be observed 
that  in  most  cases,  td  of  the  two-phase  scheme  is  about 
25% - 35% shorter than that of the linear scheme with p = 
0.0, and is about 15% - 25% shorter than that of the linear 
increases, 
s 
the 
scheme with p = 0.1. Next we consider the impact of node 
mobility and higher message loss probability. Due to lack 
of  space,  only  the  experimental  results  in  networks  with 
medium density (s = 6) are shown here. Comparing Figure 
7  and  8  we  can  find  that  first,  there  is  no  dramatic 
performance degradation in both schemes even p is up to 
30%.  Second,  the  two-phase  scheme  is  more  resilient  to 
topology  changes  caused  by  nodes  moving  in  modest 
speed. The upper limit of the reachability curve is caused 
by  node  disconnections  since  we  did  not  exclude  the 
disconnected  nodes  while  calculating  RE  (t).  The 
proposed node priority policy is then verified. In Figure 9 
- 10, the solid line represents the results of setting gw (p)
= pid  (p)  for  each  node  p  in  the  two-phase  scheme.  The 
performance is apparently much worse, especially when s
becomes larger. Finally, the simulation results by applying 
the  heuristics  described  in  Section  6.3  are  also  shown  in 
Figure  9  and  10  with  k  =  1.  It  can  be  seen  that  the 
performance  can  indeed  be  improved  by  setting  k  to  1, 
especially in sparser networks, at the expense of a slightly 
heavier  local  traffic  load.  Table  1  illustrates  the  average 
and  maximum  values  of  D  and  td  (truncated  to  integers) 
with  various  network  densities,  assuming  there  are  no 
message  losses  and  topology  changes.  From  Table  1  we 
can  see  the  average  number  of  rounds  needed  for 
achieving  more  than  90%  reachability  is  much  smaller 
than the average network diameter. It can also be observed 
that in the two-phase scheme, the increase in k can reduce 
both the average number of root nodes (denoted as rn) and 
the average number of leaf nodes (denoted as ln).
8. Concluding Remarks and Future Works 
for  heartbeat-style 
In  this  paper,  we  tackle  the  problem  of  providing 
communication  strategies 
failure 
detectors in wireless ad hoc networks. We have discussed 
two effective solutions to perform gossiping in wireless ad 
hoc networks with constraints in the message transmission 
rate  for  all  the  mobile  hosts.  Disseminating  the  gossip 
messages  through  a  routing  protocol  is  undesirable  in 
wireless  ad  hoc  networks  since  (i)  any  routing  protocol 
itself  requires  extra  messages  and  power  consumption, 
and (ii) some hot spots may be created by message routing 
and  network  longevity  may  be  decreased  because  the 
battery  power  of  these  hosts  tends  to  be  exhausted 
quickly. The proposed gossiping schemes in this paper are 
all independent of any routing protocol. The linear scheme 
is intuitive and straightforward. The two-phase scheme is 
built  on  a  transient  hierarchy  constructed  by  assigning  a 
direction to each edge periodically. This procedure can be 
performed  in  a  localized  manner,  that  is,  it  depends  only 
on  the  information  of  the  nodes  reachable  in  a  constant 
number of  hops. This concept is important in  wireless ad 
hoc  networks  since  it  can  largely  reduce  the  interference 
levels  among  nodes.  A  simulation  study  has  been 
conducted  to  compare  the  two  solutions  in  terms  of  the

reachability.  Both  of  them  are  resilient  to  message  losses 
because  we  use  local  broadcast  for  gossip  message 
propagation,  such  that  each  mobile  host  can  merge  the 
information disseminated by its one-hop neighbors into its 
next  gossip  message.  The  two-phase  scheme  is  more 
efficient  than  the  linear  scheme,  especially  in  sparse 
networks.  The  simulation  results  also  show  that  the  two-
phase scheme is more resilient to topology changes caused 
by mobile host movements. The main contributions of this 
paper  are:  (i)  to  point  out  the  demand  of  efficient  and 
robust  gossiping  mechanism 
in  a  mobile  wireless 
environment;  (ii) 
to  propose  novel  communication 
strategies  for  developing  heartbeat-style  failure  detectors 
in wireless ad hoc networks. 
to 
(probabilistically)  complete 
As  for  the  failure  detection  services  built  on  the 
proposed  gossiping  schemes,  it  is  clear  the  Strong 
Completeness  property  can  be  satisfied  since  a  crashed 
member  will  stop  sending  heartbeat.  However,  there  is  a 
trade-off  between  the  speed  and  accuracy  of  failure 
detection, because the longer it takes to judge if a member 
has crashed, the less mistakes it will make due to delayed 
or  lost  gossip  messages.  Since  this  paper  is  a  first-step 
work  on  this  topic,  no  lower  bounds  on  the  number  of 
rounds  needed 
the 
gossiping are given, and finding a suitable detection time 
to  (probabilistically)  satisfy  quantitative  requirements  on 
accuracy is still an open problem. Those are the important 
subjects in our future study. Due to the robustness of our 
gossiping  schemes,  we  believe  a  conservative  detection 
time  can  be  set  to  D × Tgossip  (the  value  of  D  may  be 
inaccurate due to topology changes). In fact, the gossiping 
schemes can be operated only over a virtual infrastructure 
with  a  smaller  diameter.  A  possible  way  is  to  use  the 
estimated  D  and  the  estimated  minimum  length  of  the 
relaying  paths  generated  in  each  round  to  decide  the 
parameters. Another direction is asking each node u to set 
a separate detection time for every other node v according 
to the heartbeat counter update frequency of v in the most 
recent r rounds.  A  mathematical analysis of the proposed 
schemes and a discussion of the issue of self-stabilization 
should also be of interesting work.
