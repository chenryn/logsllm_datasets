I have recently completed my studies in jQuery and have now moved on to JavaScript. However, I am experiencing issues with the challenges section, as it appears to be malfunctioning.

I have attempted to access this section using multiple up-to-date browsers, including Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft Edge, but the problem persists. Additionally, I have tested this issue on both my desktop and laptop, and encountered the same problem on both devices.

For your reference, I have attached a screenshot of the issue below:

Thank you for your assistance in resolving this matter.
