### 2.7. Western Blot Analysis of pERK1/2

HEK293T cells were treated with 50 nM NDP-α-MSH, 50 nM AgRP, or the ligand diluent OG-BSA as a control in serum-free medium for 5 minutes. The medium was then removed, and the cells were washed with ice-cold DPBS. Subsequently, the cells were lysed using cell lysis buffer supplemented with PMSF and protein phosphatase inhibitors (Solarbio Life Science). The cellular lysates were collected by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm at 4°C for 8 minutes, and protein concentrations were quantified using a BCA kit (Beyotime Biotech).

Protein samples (100 μg) were separated by 12.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore) using a Mini trans-blot cell and system (Bio-Rad). The membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat dried milk in TBST (Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween-20) for 2 hours. They were then incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies: phospho-p44/42 MAPK (ERK1/2) rabbit mAb and α-tubulin rabbit mAb (1:1000 dilution, Cell Signaling Technology). After thorough washing with TBST, the membranes were incubated with anti-rabbit IgG HRP-linked secondary antibody (1:5000 dilution) for 1.5 hours at room temperature. Bound antibodies were detected using the FluorChemM system (ProteinSimple) with ECL reagent (New Cell & Molecular Biotech).

### 2.8. Statistical Analysis

Digital images of Western blots were analyzed by densitometry using ImageJ software, and dose-response analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 6. All data are presented as means ± SD. Unpaired t-tests were used to compare two groups, while one-way ANOVA was used for multiple group comparisons. P-values were calculated, and statistical significance was defined as *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.

### 3. Results and Discussion

#### 3.1. Phylogenetic and Protein Structure Analysis

Based on the putative MC5R genes from the NCBI database (cMC5R, KF670718; dMC5R, XM_005018192; gMC5R, XM_013179517; pMC5R, XM_021097606.1), we designed forward and reverse primers (Table S1) to amplify the full-length sequences from DNA extracts of poultry blood and pig liver. As shown in Fig. 1A, the targeted genes, including c/d/gMC5Rs (978 bp) and pMC5R (1233 bp), were successfully amplified. First-generation sequencing results indicated that c/d/gMC5Rs have 100% identity with the putative sequences, while pMC5R has an additional 108–164 bp sequence at the N-terminal. The cloned cMC5R DNA sequence showed 100% identity with a previously reported melanocortin receptor gene in chickens (Takeuchi and Takahashi, 1998).

To investigate the genetic characterization of MC5R genes, we conducted a phylogenetic analysis of 11 species. We found that the MC5R genes of chicken, duck, and goose clustered in one subgroup, while pMC5R showed higher homology with livestock such as sheep and cattle (Fig. 1B). Amino acid sequence comparison revealed that human MC5R shares 77.8%, 78.2%, 78.2%, and 63.2% identity with chicken, duck, goose, and pig, respectively, indicating significant differences between human and other animals (Fig. 1C). Consistent with the genetic alignment, c/d/gMC5Rs have high identity (>95%) with each other but only 56.1–57.1% identity with pMC5R. Notably, dMC5R and gMC5R displayed 100% identity.

To fully compare the differences between h/c/d/g/pMC5Rs, we predicted their 3D protein structures using homology modeling. Our results showed that hMC5R possesses seven transmembrane domains, consistent with previous studies (Yang et al., 2013b). Similarly, c/d/g/pMC5Rs also have seven transmembrane domains, but there are several differences, particularly in non-transmembrane regions. For example, h/pMC5Rs have an additional helix in the coil region compared to c/d/gMC5Rs, and all four MC5Rs have an additional helix at the C-terminal compared to hMC5R (Fig. 1D). These findings demonstrate the genetic and protein differences among the five MC5Rs, suggesting that these receptors from poultry and pigs may have distinct functions both in vitro and in vivo.

#### 3.2. Construction of Mutants and Induced Basal Activity Changes in HEK293T Cells

Previous studies have shown that substituting charged amino acid residues Glu (D) 119 in TMD3, aromatic amino acids Phe (F) 254 in TMD6, and His (H) 257 in TMD7 with alanine significantly decreased NDP-α-MSH binding and receptor activity, indicating that these positions are critical for ligand-hMC5R interaction (Yang et al., 2013a). To investigate whether these specific amino acid residues in the conserved region have similar effects on the function of cloned c/d/g/pMC5Rs, we replaced three amino acid residues with alanine through homologous recombination (Table S1). Sequencing confirmed the successful generation of 12 alanine-substitution mutants, including c/d/gMC5R-D119A/F254A/H257A and pMC5R-D204A/F339A/H342A (Fig. 1C and S1).

In 1989, Costa et al. discovered that δ-opioid receptors exhibit intrinsic or basal activity even in the absence of ligand stimulation (Costa and Herz, 1989). Basal activity plays a crucial role in regulating signal conversion processes (Orozco-Cabal et al., 2006). We determined the basal activity of c/d/g/pMC5Rs and their mutants in HEK293T cells by measuring intracellular cAMP levels using a dual-luciferase reporter gene assay, which is more sensitive (10 to 100-fold) than other methods like ELISA. Interestingly, the F254A mutants in c/d/gMC5Rs showed significantly increased basal activity compared to the wild type, especially for cMC5R, with about a 15-fold increase (Fig. 2). No significant changes were observed in the D119A/H257A mutants of c/d/gMC5Rs. For pMC5R, only the H342A mutant showed enhanced basal activity. These results indicate that MC5Rs can be expressed and have certain activities without ligand stimulation after transfection into HEK293T cells, and mutations at specific amino acid positions can affect basal activity.

#### 3.3. Signaling Properties of Four MC5Rs and Their Mutants with Ligands

We next investigated the response of the four MC5Rs and their mutants to ligand stimulation by measuring intracellular cAMP generation. As shown in Fig. 3 and Table 1, the mutants c/d/gMC5R-D119A and pMC5R-D204A completely lost reactivity to all three agonists (α-MSH, NDP-α-MSH, SHU9119) and one antagonist (AgRP), suggesting that the acidic amino acid Glu (D) at position 119 in c/d/gMC5R and 204 in pMC5R is essential for intracellular signaling. Under α-MSH stimulation, the reactivity of c/d/gMC5R-F254A/H257A and pMC5R-F339A/H342A significantly decreased. However, the activity of these mutants could be improved by NDP-α-MSH, a more potent synthetic agonist than natural agonist (α-MSH) for hMC1R/MC3R/MC4R/MC5R (Bednarek et al., 1999; Handl et al., 2007). These results demonstrate that NDP-α-MSH has selective potent agonism not only for most subtypes of MCRs (except MC2R) (Wang and Tao, 2011, 2013; Yang and Harmon, 2017) but also for MC5Rs.

SHU9119, a synthetic MSH analogue, is known as an antagonist of hMC3R and hMC4R (Grieco et al., 2007; Yang et al., 2002). However, we found that SHU9119 had a stronger agonist effect on MC5R than α-MSH in the four animals. Additionally, the signal window of c/d/gMC5R-H257A to SHU9119 significantly increased, while pMC5R-H342A showed a decrease in signal window and an increased EC50 with SHU9119, indicating that SHU9119 has a higher affinity for poultry MC5R than pig (Yang et al., 2013a). Consistent with our findings, SHU9119 has been reported to enhance fatty acid oxidation mediated by NDP-α-MSH in primary muscle cells (Juan Ji et al., 2007).

In vitro studies have shown that AgRP is an effective selective antagonist of hMC3R and hMC5R (Yang et al., 1999). However, we could not detect the response activity of the wild-type MC5Rs from the four animals to AgRP. Only the reactivity of c/d/gMC5R-F254A and pMC5R-F339A mutants could be detected. The significantly enhanced basal activity of c/d/gMC5R-F254A may contribute to the determination of antagonistic activity. In contrast, pMC5R-F339A showed comparable activity with the wild type and displayed decreased cAMP generation. These mutations likely alter the spatial structure of the proteins and their corresponding response to AgRP, though further evidence is needed to confirm this.
