(10−11 ~ 10−6 M) of α-MSH, NDP-α-MSH, SHU9119 or AgRP (diluted
with OG-BSA) at 37 °C for 6 h. The supernatant was removed and cells
were immediately washed with DPBS and lysed by cell lysis buﬀer (in
kit). Intracellular cAMP generations were quantiﬁed following the
manufacturer instructions using the dual luciferase reporter gene assay
kit (Beyotime Biotech). Supernatant of each sample were detected for
1 s by GloMax-Multi (Promega).

2.7. Western-blotting analysis of pERK1/2
HEK293T cells were treated for 5 min in serum free medium with
50 nM NDP-α-MSH or 50 nM AgRP or ligand diluent OG-BSA as control.
The medium was removed and cells were immediately washed with ice-
cold DPBS and lysed with cell lysis buﬀer adding PMSF and protein
phosphatase inhibitors (Solarbio Life Science). Cellular lysates were
collected by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm at 4 °C for 8 min, and protein
concentrations were quantiﬁed by a BCA kit (Beyotime Biotech).
Protein (100 μg) were separated by a 12.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate-
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred onto
polyvinylidene diﬂuoride membranes (PVDF, Millipore) using a Mini
trans-blot cell and system (Bio-Rad). The membranes were blocked with
5% non-fat dried milk in TBST (tris buﬀer saline with 0.1% Tween-20)
for 2 h, then incubated with phospho-p44/42 MAPK (ERK1/2) rabbit
mAb and α-tubulin rabbit mAb (1:1000 dilution, cell signaling tech-
nology) at 4 °C for overnight. After thorough washing with TBST, the
anti-pERK1/2 and α-tubulin primary antibodies were incubated with
anti-rabbit IgG HRP-linked antibody (1:5000 dilution) for 1.5 h at room
temperature. The bound antibodies were detected by FluorChemM
(ProteinSimple) using ECL reagent (New Cell & Molecular Biotech).
2.8. Statistical analysis
Digital images of Western-blots were analyzed by densitometry
using Image J and the dose–response analysis was performed using
GraphPad Prism 6 software. All data were presented as means ± SD.
Unpaired t-test between two groups or one-way ANOVA among mul-
tiple groups were used to calculate P-values (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01,
***P < 0.001).
3. Results and discussions
3.1. Phylogenetic and protein structures analysis
Based on the putative MC5Rs genes from NCBI database (cMC5R,
KF670718; dMC5R, XM_005018192; gMC5R, XM_013179517; pMC5R,
XM_021097606.1), we designed favorable forward and reverse primers
(Table S1) to amplify the full-length sequences from DNA extracts of
poultry blood and pig liver. As shown in Fig. 1A, targeted genes in-
cluding c/d/gMC5Rs (978 bp) and pMC5R (1233 bp) were successfully
ampliﬁed. Additional ﬁrst-generation sequencing results showed that c/
d/gMC5Rs have 100% identity with the putative sequences, whereas
pMC5R displays an excess sequence of 108–164 bp at N-terminal.
Consistently, the DNA sequence of cloned cMC5R shows 100% identity
with a previous report on melanocortin receptor genes in the chicken
(Takeuchi and Takahashi, 1998). To investigate the genetic character-
ization of MC5R genes, we conducted phylogenetic analysis from 11
species. We found that MC5R genes of chicken, duck and goose were
clustered in one subgroup, however,
the pMC5R showed higher
homology with livestock such as sheep and cattle (Fig. 1B). Subse-
quently, we compared their homology at amino acids level. Comparison
analysis showed that the human MC5R shared 77.8%, 78.2%, 78.2%
and 63.2% identity with chicken, duck, goose and pig, suggesting the
signiﬁcant diﬀerence between human and other animals (Fig. 1C).
Consistent with the genetic alignment analysis, the c/d/gMC5Rs have
high identity more than 95% with others, but only have 56.1–57.1%
identity with pMC5Rs. Of note, the dMC5R and gMC5R displayed 100%
identity. To fully compare the diﬀerence between h/c/d/g/pMC5Rs, we
predicted their protein 3D structures by homology model analysis. Our
results showed that hMC5R possesses seven transmembrane domains,
which is consistent with previous study (Yang et al., 2013b). Notably,
c/d/g/pMC5Rs also have seven transmembrane domains that seem to
similar with hMC5R. Nevertheless, we still observed several diﬀerences
between ﬁve MC5Rs, particularly for non-transmembrane domains. As
marked parts by green circle, h/pMC5Rs have one more helix during
General and Comparative Endocrinology 283 (2019) 113233
the coil region compared with c/d/gMC5Rs. In addition, compared with
hMC5R, other four MC5Rs also have one more helix at C-terminal
(marked by purple circle). Collectively, these results demonstrated the
genetic and protein diﬀerence between all ﬁve MC5Rs, suggesting that
these MC5Rs from poultry and pig may possess diﬀerent functions both
in vitro and in vivo.
3.2. Construction of mutants and induced basal activity change in
HEK293T cells
Previous study has demonstrated that the substitution of charged
amino acid residue Glutamic acid (D) 119 in TMD3, aromatic amino
acids phenylalanine (F) 254 in TMD6 and histidine (H) 257 in TMD7
with alanine signiﬁcantly decreased NDP-α-MSH binding and receptor
activity, implying that these amino acid positions are critical for li-
gands-hMC5R interaction (Yang et al., 2013a). To investigate whether
these speciﬁc amino acids residues in conserved region have a similar
eﬀect on the function of cloned c/d/g/pMC5Rs, we replaced three
amino acid residues by alanine, the simplest chiral amino acids, for
each MC5Rs by reasonable homologous recombination (Table S1), re-
spectively. Further sequencing results showed that we successfully ob-
tained 12 alanine-substitution mutants for four MC5Rs, including c/d/
gMC5R-D119A/F254A/H257A and
pMC5R-D204A/F339A/H342A
(Fig. 1C and S1). In 1989, Costa et al. found that δ-opioid receptors still
exhibit some activity in the absence of ligand stimulation, which was
then termed receptor intrinsic or basal activity (Costa and Herz, 1989).
In addition, basal activity of receptors plays an important regulatory
role in tuning signal conversion process (Orozco-Cabal et al., 2006).
Given this phenomenon, we ﬁrst determined the basal activity of c/d/
g/pMC5Rs and their mutants in HEK293T cells through measuring the
cAMP levels. Notably, a dual-luciferase reporter genes assay was ap-
plied for this measurement, which has lower limit of detection and
higher sensitive (10 to 100-fold) than other methods such as enzyme-
linked immune-sorbent assay (ELISA) to directly detect cAMP. Inter-
estingly, we observed that the F254A mutants in c/d/gMC5Rs displayed
signiﬁcant increased basal activity compared with the wide type,
especially for cMC5R with about 15-fold change (Fig. 2). No signiﬁcant
changes were found in the D119A/H257A mutants of c/d/gMC5Rs. For
pMC5R, only the H342 mutant showed enhanced basal activity. These
results demonstrated that MC5Rs can be successfully expressed and
have certain activities without the stimulation of ligands after being
transfected into HEK293T cells. Meanwhile, the mutations at certain
amino acid positions would aﬀect its basal activity such as F254A in c/
d/gMC5Rs and H342A in pMC5R.
3.3. Signaling properties of four MC5Rs and their mutants with ligands
Having shown that c/d/g/pMC5Rs and their speciﬁc mutants de-
monstrated diﬀerent-levels basal activity in the absence of ligands, we
next sought to investigate whether the cloned four MC5Rs and their
mutants could respond to stimulation of ligands. To that end, we de-
termined the generation of intracellular cAMP in the presence of in-
creasing ligands. As shown in Fig. 3 and Table 1, the mutants c/d/
gMC5R-D119A and pMC5R-D204A completely lost reactivity against all
three agonists (α-MSH/NDP-α-MSH/SHU9119) and one antagonist
(AgRP), suggesting the acidic amino acid Glu (D) at position of 119 in
c/d/gMC5R and 204 in pMC5R plays an irreplaceable role in the in-
tracellular cellular signaling. Besides, under the stimulation of agonist
α-MSH, the reactivity of c/d/gMC5R-F254A/ H257A and pMC5R-
F339A/H342A signiﬁcantly decreased. The activity of their mutants
could be improved by NDP-α-MSH with EC50 from 10−10 to 10−11 mol/
L, a more potent synthetic agonist than natural agonist (α-MSH) for
hMC1R/MC3R/MC4R/MC5R (Bednarek et al., 1999; Handl et al.,
2007). There results demonstrated that NDP-α-MSH has selective po-
tent agonism not only for most subtypes of MCRs (except MC2R) (Wang
and Tao, 2011, 2013; Yang and Harmon, 2017), but also for MC5Rs

than α-MSH (1–24). Because avian pituitary lacks an intermediate lobe
and thus ACTH is recognized as the primary melanocortin ligand re-
leased by the avian pituitary (Chrétien, 2013; Takahashi and Mizusawa,
2013). To better understand the pharmacology of cMC5R, we compared
its response to the stimulation of ACTH(1–24) with NDP-α-MSH. We
found that cMC5R showed comparable aﬃnity for these two ligands
with an EC50 of appropriate 10−11 mol/L (Thomas et al., 2018). Con-
sistently, a similar result was observed for red stingray (Dasyatis akajei)
melanocortin receptors (Dores et al., 2018). In addition, a recent study
demonstrated that co-expression of cMC5R with the accessory proteins
cMRAP1 increased sensitivity for ACTH(1–24) by approximately 365-
fold. However, co-expressing of cMRAP2 with cMC5R had no eﬀect on
its sensitivity to hACTH(1–24) (Thomas et al., 2018). It is conceivable
that the cMRAP1 supplementation may further enhance the cMC5R
reactivity with ligands.
SHU9119, a synthetic MSH analogue, has been proved as an an-
tagonist of hMC3R and hMC4R (Grieco et al., 2007; Yang et al., 2002).
However, we found that SHU9119 had a stronger agonist eﬀect on
MC5R than α-MSH in four animals. Besides, we found that the signal
window of c/d/gMC5R-H257A to SHU9119 signiﬁcantly increased, but
pMC5R-H342A showed a decrease in signal window and an increased
EC50 with SHU9119 than poultry, indicating that SHU9119 had a
higher aﬃnity for poultry MC5R than pig (Yang et al., 2013a). Con-
sistent with our results, SHU9119 has been reported to enhance the
fatty acid oxidation mediated by NDP-α-MSH in primary muscle cells
(Juan Ji et al., 2007). In vitro studies have shown that AgRP is an ef-
fective selective antagonist of hMC3R and hMC5R (Yang et al., 1999),
whereas we could not detect the response activity of four animal MC5R
wild types to AgRP, and only the reactivity of c/d/gMC5R-F254A and
pMC5R-F339A mutants could be detected. The signiﬁcant enhanced
basal activity of c/d/gMC5R-F254A may contribute to the determina-
tion of the antagonistic activity. However, pMC5R-F339A has a com-
parable activity with wide type and displayed decreased cAMP

from diﬀerent species (poultry and livestock). Besides these two li-
gands, it has been suggested that melanocortin receptors from chicken
such as cMC1R, cMC3R, cMC4R, cMC5R had higher aﬃnity with ATCH

mutations alter the spatial structure of proteins and corresponding re-
sponse to AgRP. However, at the current stage, the speciﬁc reasons
warrant more evidence.
