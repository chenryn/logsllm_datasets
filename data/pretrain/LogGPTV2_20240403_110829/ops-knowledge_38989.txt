Question: In the context of server-side web applications, why is proper input validation critical in preventing code injection attacks?
"A": "Input validation ensures that only numerical data is accepted, which inherently prevents code execution.",
"B": "It enables the application to distinguish between code and data by enforcing input constraints, thus preventing malicious input from being executed as code.",
"C": "Validation of input is important primarily for user experience, not security, and has no effect on code injection risks.",
"D": "Input validation eliminates the need for other security measures like firewalls and intrusion detection systems."
Answer: B
