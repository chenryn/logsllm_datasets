### Issue Report

#### Summary
I have thoroughly searched the issues in this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.

#### Expected Behavior
When using the `MySelect` component, I expect to be able to access the entire `<input>` HTML tag, including its `name` attribute, from the event target.

#### Current Behavior
Currently, when the `MySelect` component is used, the event target only provides an object with a `value` field, and the `name` attribute is not included.

#### Steps to Reproduce
1. Render the `MySelect` component as follows:
    ```jsx
    const setData = (e) => console.log(e.target);

    export const MySelect = () => (
        <Select
            onChange={setData}
            label="CivilitÃ©"
            name="civility"
        >
            <MenuItem value="monsieur">Monsieur</MenuItem>
            <MenuItem value="madame">Madame</MenuItem>
        </Select>
    );
    ```
2. Open your browser's developer console and observe the output when you interact with the `MySelect` component.

#### Context
I need to access the `name` field of my `Select` component. However, this field is not present in the triggered event, which only contains the `value` field.
