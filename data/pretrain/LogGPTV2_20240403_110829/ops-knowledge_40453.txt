User: How to conduct system monitoring and performance analysis? Which tools are recommended?
Assistant: 1. System monitoring tools: - top: It can display the occupation of the current system process, including CPU, memory and virtual memory. - htop: It can display the usage of various aspects of the system more intuitively, including CPU and memory usage, number of processes, file system IO, etc. - iostat: It can monitor the IO status of the system, including hard disk IO read and write status, network IO status, etc. - sar: statistics and analysis can be made on various indicators of the system, including CPU usage, memory usage, IO read and write status, etc. 2. Performance analysis tools: - strace: It can track the system call process of the process, and can be used to view the call status of the process, file system IO, etc. - ltrace: It can track the library function call process of the process, which can be used to see which library functions are called by the process. - perf: System performance analysis can be performed, including CPU performance analysis, memory analysis, etc. - gdb: Process debugging can be performed, which can be used to view and analyze the running status of the process. The above are some commonly used system monitoring and performance analysis tools. It is recommended to use htop, sar, perf and other tools for comprehensive performance analysis and optimization.
