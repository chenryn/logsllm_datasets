### Title: Black Hat US-20: Real-Time Detection of Fake 4G Base Stations

**Abstract:**

The use of 4G/LTE IMSI-catchers, such as the Hailstorm, is on the rise among governments, law enforcement agencies, spies, and even criminals. Despite this trend, current detection efforts have primarily focused on 2G IMSI-catchers, like the Stingray, which are becoming less common. In this presentation, we aim to dispel misconceptions about the capabilities and limitations of modern IMSI-catchers, drawing on recent research in cellular network security.

We will demonstrate software and heuristics for detecting fake 4G/LTE base stations, providing practical tools that can be implemented by anyone. Additionally, we will outline a roadmap for addressing some of the fundamental security issues in cellular networks, with the goal of eventually rendering IMSI-catchers obsolete.

**Key Points:**
- **Rising Threat:** The increasing popularity of 4G/LTE IMSI-catchers.
- **Detection Focus:** Shifting from 2G to 4G/LTE IMSI-catcher detection.
- **Myth-Busting:** Clarifying what modern IMSI-catchers can and cannot do.
- **Practical Tools:** Demonstrating software and heuristics for detecting fake 4G/LTE base stations.
- **Future Solutions:** Outlining steps to improve cellular network security and eliminate the threat of IMSI-catchers.
