User: Describe how Nginx works, and how to implement reverse proxy function in Nginx?
Assistant: Nginx is a high-performance web server and reverse proxy server. It adopts event-driven architecture and non-blocking IO model, and can handle a large number of concurrent requests. Its working principle is as follows: 1. Nginx acts as a web server to receive HTTP requests from clients. 2. Nginx processes requests according to configuration files, and can serve static files and forward dynamic requests. 3. If it is a static request, read the local file directly and return it to the client. 4. If it is a dynamic request, forward the request to the corresponding application server according to the configuration file, obtain the corresponding result and return it to the client. 5. During request processing, Nginx will also perform functions such as caching and load balancing. Reverse proxy is an important function of Nginx, which can be easily implemented in Nginx through configuration files. A reverse proxy is usually used to hide the real IP address of the back-end server, which improves the security of the server and can perform load balancing among multiple back-end servers. The specific implementation steps are as follows: 1. Set the relevant parameters of the reverse proxy in the Nginx configuration file, such as the IP address and port number of the proxy server. 2. Map the URL in the client request to the backend server, and send the request to the backend server. 3. The backend server processes the request and generates a response, and returns the result to Nginx. 4. Nginx returns the response content to the client. The reverse proxy can effectively improve the performance and reliability of the server, and guarantee the high availability and high user traffic of the website.
