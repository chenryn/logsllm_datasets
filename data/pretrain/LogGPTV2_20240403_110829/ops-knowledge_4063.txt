Question: "A company is developing a security system that relies on automated facial recognition to grant access to restricted areas. The system is based on machine learning algorithms that have been trained on a vast dataset of face images. Considering the risk of adversarial input perturbations, what are the potential strengths and limitations of this system?"
 "A": "The system can quickly adapt to new users by learning from additional data over time."
 "B": "The system could be tricked by introducing small, imperceptible changes to a face image that lead to misclassification."
 "C": "The system might be less effective if attackers lack the technical expertise to create adversarial inputs."
 "D": "The system may incorrectly recognize a person if the input data it was trained on is not sufficiently diverse."
Answer: BD
