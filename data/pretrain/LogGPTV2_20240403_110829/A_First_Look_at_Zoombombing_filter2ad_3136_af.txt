### Mitigating Zoombombing: A Data-Driven Analysis

#### Introduction
In the context of large meetings, it is crucial to verify the meeting room's security. Our analysis reveals that insiders often provide additional information to potential attackers, such as instructing them to use names that match legitimate participants. This practice diminishes the effectiveness of waiting rooms, making it more challenging for hosts and moderators to identify intruders.

#### Unique Links for Participants
Providing a unique link to each participant significantly reduces the likelihood of successful zoombombing attacks. If the meeting service still allows multiple people to join with the same link, at least this offers some accountability, as the host can trace the insider based on the unique link used by the attackers. An even more effective mitigation is to allow each link to be used by a single participant at a time. This ensures that unauthorized individuals cannot join using the same link, as long as the insider has already joined. While this measure makes zoombombing unfeasible, not all meeting services have adopted it. As of now, only Zoom and Webex offer per-participant links that allow a single user to join at a time. For instance, Zoom requires participants to log in and verifies if the unique link matches the one sent to their email address via a calendar invite. We encourage other meeting platforms to implement similar access control measures to protect against insider threats. Additionally, other mitigations, such as expiring meeting links after a single use, are also viable.

#### Opportunistic Nature of Attacks
We find that zoombombing attacks typically occur opportunistically, with insiders inviting others to join meetings in real-time. This reduces the effectiveness of proactive measures like monitoring social media for future attack calls.

#### Limitations and Future Work
As with any data-driven study, our research has limitations. We only have access to a 1% sample of Twitter, so our results related to Twitter represent a lower bound of the actual problem. API limitations prevent us from collecting replies to zoombombing tweets, limiting our understanding of how attacks unfold on the platform. On 4chan, users are anonymous, which hinders tracing per-user behavior and identifying serial offenders. It is also possible that zoombombing attacks are organized on other platforms beyond Twitter and 4chan. While we believe these two services provide a representative overview of behaviors and motives, attackers on other platforms might operate differently. Finally, our analysis is limited to calls for attacks and responses on social media; we cannot observe what happens in the actual meeting rooms. Future work could involve alternative study designs, such as analyzing recorded online meetings that were bombed or interviewing victims, to better understand the mental and emotional impact of zoombombing.

#### Related Work
**Coordinated Malicious Activity on Social Media:**
The security community has extensively studied automated malicious behavior on social media, focusing on spam [17, 21, 51] and reputation inflation [10, 46, 48]. Detection systems rely on the large-scale, automated nature of these operations and the synchronization features of malicious accounts [7, 45, 54]. More recently, the focus has expanded to include coordinated campaigns by humans controlling a small number of inauthentic accounts, such as pushing conspiracy theories [41, 42] and influence campaigns by foreign state actors [1, 52].

**Coordinated Online Harassment and Aggression:**
A closer line of work to our study examines coordinated behavior aimed at harassing victims online. Kumar et al. [28] measured the problem of brigading on Reddit, where members of one subreddit organize to disrupt another community. Hine et al. [23] studied the activity of 4chanâ€™s Politically Incorrect Board (/pol/), showing that members often call for attacks against YouTube video posters. Mariconti et al. [33] developed a multimodal machine learning system to predict videos likely to receive hate attacks. Zannettou et al. [53] investigated the effect of posting URLs to news articles on 4chan and Reddit, finding that certain types of news outlets result in increased hate speech. Snyder et al. [40] studied doxing, where attackers post personal information about a victim, calling for harassment through multiple media. Tseng et al. [47] analyzed forums where miscreants share tools and techniques for spying and harassing partners.

**Conclusion:**
Our work builds on previous research on coordinated harassment by studying the emerging problem of zoombombing. Unlike previously studied threats, zoombombing attacks are often called by insiders, which has important implications for designing security mitigations.

#### Conclusion
In this paper, we conducted the first data-driven study of calls for zoombombing attacks on social media. Our findings indicate that these attacks primarily target online lectures and are often initiated by insiders with legitimate access to the meetings. Insiders frequently share confidential information like meeting passwords and the identity of real participants, rendering common protections ineffective. We also found that zoombombing calls usually target meetings happening in real time, making proactive identification of such attacks challenging. To mitigate this threat, we recommend that online meeting services allow hosts to create unique meeting links for each participant, although we acknowledge the usability implications and feasibility challenges.
