## Abstract
In recent years, the belief that the current IP-based Internet is becoming obsolete has prompted several research efforts to design potential next-generation Internet architectures. Named Data Networking (NDN), an instantiation of the content-centric approach, is one such effort. Unlike IP-based networks, NDN routers maintain a significant amount of state information. This paper investigates the use of this feature for covert ephemeral communication (CEC). CEC allows two or more parties to exchange ephemeral messages, which become unavailable after a certain period. Our techniques rely solely on network-layer services, making our protocols robust and difficult to detect. We demonstrate that users can build high-bandwidth CEC channels by exploiting unique NDN features such as in-network caches, routers' forwarding state, and name matching rules. We evaluate the feasibility and performance of these CEC channels using a local setup and the official NDN testbed.

## Introduction
The current IP-based Internet architecture has been a resounding success, exceeding expectations in terms of flexibility, robustness, longevity, and scalability. However, its lightweight design, which maintains most state at endpoints rather than within the network, has led to some shortcomings, particularly in supporting efficient large-scale content distribution. Content distribution now accounts for most Internet traffic, and major content providers have turned to Content Distribution Networks (CDNs) to address performance, cost, and reliability issues. This situation has motivated research into new networking architectures, such as Named Data Networking (NDN).

NDN is a content-centric networking (CCN) architecture where location-independent content is directly addressable by a human-readable name. Routers can cache forwarded content to efficiently satisfy subsequent requests. While this facilitates efficient content distribution, it also introduces new security and privacy issues. In this paper, we investigate how NDN router state can be used for covert ephemeral communication (CEC). We show that parties can communicate secretly without directly exchanging packets or injecting new content into the network, a significant departure from what is possible with IP.

This work is timely and important due to the growing interest in content-centric networking, particularly NDN. CEC is relevant in scenarios such as:
1. Tightly-controlled environments (e.g., military) where mandatory access control is in place. CEC can be used to exfiltrate sensitive information, making forensic analysis difficult.
2. Countries with oppressive governments, where civil rights activists can covertly coordinate and exchange information, offering plausible deniability.

Exploring CEC is crucial for understanding the implications of NDN, whether it is deployed as an overlay on top of IP or as a replacement. Existing covert channels rely on end-node state, but this paper shows how to construct covert channels at the network architecture level, independent of any particular application.

We design several protocols for exchanging covert ephemeral messages (CEMs) between a sender and one or more receivers. We evaluate our techniques on a LAN and a geographically distributed NDN testbed, confirming that CEC is feasible and provides high bandwidth and low error rates.

## 2. NDN Overview
NDN is a networking architecture based on named content. Content is requested via interests and delivered in content packets, which include a name, payload, and digital signature. Names are hierarchical, and content is delivered only upon explicit request. If no local copy of the desired content is available, an NDN router forwards the interest towards the content producer using name prefixes. Each router maintains a Pending Interest Table (PIT) to track outstanding interests. When content is returned, it is forwarded back along the reverse path, and each router caches a copy of the content.

Unlike IP, NDN routers can forward interests out on multiple interfaces simultaneously to maximize retrieval speed. Interests that cannot be satisfied are removed from the PIT after a predefined expiration time.

## 3. System Model
A CEC system involves a sender (Snd) and one or more receivers (Rcv). Snd wants to publish a time-bounded (ephemeral) message M, while Rcv wants to retrieve it. A time-bounded message can only be read for a given period, after which it expires. Depending on the scenario, retrieving a CEM either makes it expire immediately or defers its expiration.

Snd and Rcv are not allowed to communicate directly, and they cannot use services like email or online forums. They have access to a producer (Pr) that hosts content and is unaware of their intent to communicate. All packets to and from Pr are routed through an NDN router (Rt) that caches all content packets it forwards. Initially, Rt is assumed to be the first-hop router, but this assumption is later relaxed to allow Rt to be an arbitrary number of hops away from both Snd and Rcv.

We assume that Snd and Rcv have tightly synchronized clocks, which is realistic given the availability of NTP servers and GPS devices.
