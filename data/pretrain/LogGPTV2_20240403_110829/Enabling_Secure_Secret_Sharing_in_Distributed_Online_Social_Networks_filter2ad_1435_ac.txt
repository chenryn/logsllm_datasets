Figure 1: Inﬂuence of the crypto threshold ξ on the fraction of secrets lost fL with different delegate-selection algorithms. The two critical
values of ξ are ξ = 1.0 and ξ < 1.0
Figure 1(left side of e, f). These observations will be veriﬁed
in the next section.
D. Effects of delegate selection algorithms
As
the next
step, we measured effects of differ-
ent delegate-selection algorithms (FRIENDBASED, RAN-
DOMWALK, and TRUSTBASED) to the system security
under various load intensities.
Speciﬁcally, the ﬁrst load factor pmal was varied from
0.1% to 50% to simulate different environments with small
(0.1% to 1%) and large (1% to 50%) numbers of malicious
users under adversary control. Initially malicious users were
randomly distributed in the network and each experiment
was carried out in both settings: with or without infection
spreading (inf = false or true).
From previous experiments (Section IV-C), we are only
interested in two critical values (ξ = 1 and ξ < 1) of
threshold ξ. The results are given in Figures 2.
We observe that the selection approach TRUSTBASED
is the best or comparable with the best in most cases, as
shown in Figure 2(a, b, d). In the only case with a very
small number of initially malicious users, and with ξ = 1
425
of Fig. 2(c), the selection algorithm FRIENDBASED is the
best. In practice, using the maximal threshold ξ = 1 may
not be preferable, as the secret owner may have to wait for
every delegate to be online to reconstruct her backed-up se-
cret. One possible reason why the TRUSTBASED selection
algorithm performs less well in this case is the difference
between the actual vulnerability of the environment and
the use of exponential functions σ(.) and δ(.) to evaluate
the trustworthiness measure of available delegate candidates.
Nevertheless, performance of the TRUSTBASED algorithm
is still reasonably good in this case: fL < 0.018 for
pmal ≈ 1% and inf = true as in Fig. 2(c). Remember that
fL is our system performance metric measured under a very
pessimistic estimation, where the adversary had unlimited
computational power to decrypt any protected share it ever
stole, the attained performance is acceptable.
The RANDOMWALK delegate
selection approach,
though intuitively appealing, is not superior. Its performance
is somehow better where there is no infection spreading and
the adversary controls a very small number nodes, as shown
in Figure 2(c) and in the right pane of Figure 2(a).
