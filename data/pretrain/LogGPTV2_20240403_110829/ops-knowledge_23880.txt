User: How to manage Docker container logs for troubleshooting?
Assistant: Docker container log management can be implemented in the following ways: 1. Use the docker logs command to view container logs. This command can display the standard output and standard error of the specified container, and you can use the --tail option to specify the number of log lines to view. 2. Write container logs to standard output or standard error. You can use the standard log library to write key information to standard output or standard error, so that you can view the log information of the container through the docker logs command. 3. Use a log collection tool. You can use log collection tools like Rizhiyi or Splunk to collect and analyze container log information for troubleshooting. 4. Output container logs to a specified location by configuring the log driver of Docker Engine. By configuring the log driver, you can store container logs in specified locations, such as files, syslog, or Fluentd, and manage and analyze container log information in a unified manner.
