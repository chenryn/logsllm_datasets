User: I need to be able to run python 3.2 scripts from cygwin.However,the current setup of cygwin shows it isnt compatible with that.I searched on the internet and saw in some other forums that people have ben unable to do it.Anyone here has any idea how  to do it?
Assistant: Ok.one solution i have found is that i can invoke cygwin through command window and then pass instructions using subprocess.However being able to run python 3.2 codes from cygwin would have been more preferable to me rather than the other way round!!
