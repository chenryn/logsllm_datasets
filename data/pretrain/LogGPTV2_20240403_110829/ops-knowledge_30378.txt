User: Given a host's IP address, how do you determine if the host is reachable without using the ping command?
Assistant: You can use the telnet command to try to connect to the port of the host. If the connection is successful, the host is reachable. You can also use the traceroute or nslookup commands to check whether the network is reachable.
