User:  Describe the main characteristics and advantages of distributed system architectures.
Assistant: The main features of the distributed system architecture are: 1) It is composed of multiple independent computing nodes, each node has independent computing and storage resources; 2) The nodes are interconnected through network communication, message transmission and data exchange; 3 ) There may be one or more central nodes in the system to manage the entire system, or it may be completely decentralized. The main advantages of the distributed system architecture are: 1) Improve the reliability and availability of the system, because each node can perform tasks independently, and a failure on one node will not affect the entire system; 2) Improve the scalability of the system It can increase the computing and storage capacity of the system by adding nodes; 3) It provides better cost performance, because a powerful system can be created by combining cheap hardware; 4) It is suitable for processing large-scale data and high Concurrent business scenarios. In short, the distributed system architecture has obvious advantages in terms of reliability, scalability, cost performance, and suitability for processing large-scale data and high-concurrency business scenarios.
