User: Is that possible to redirect to another url with a delay in GAE? I know I can use JavaScript for this purpose, but may be there is a way to do delayed redirection without it?
Now I use self.redirect("/") from GAE tutorial.
Thanks.
Assistant: import time  at the top of your module and do a time.sleep(0.5) before you do a self.redirect call. The sleep argument can take a floating point value of number of seconds to delay. Just make sure that you don't exceed 30 seconds of delay as GAE expects that every request be handled within that otherwise it will be interrupted.
