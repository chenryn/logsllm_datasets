4.1 Threat Variable
Most threats cannot be considered in isolation, since they
in(cid:13)uence each other and subsequently change the threat
probability of adjacent threats. When for example analyzing
the (cid:12)re threat, threats such as lighting impact or a failure
in the (cid:12)re detection and extinguishing system in(cid:13)uence the
threat probability of the actual (cid:12)re threat. When thinking
about threats that are in(cid:13)uenced by the (cid:12)re threat itself,
several dependencies could be identi(cid:12)ed as well. Smoke or
asset damage represent only a few threats which probability
is in(cid:13)uenced by the (cid:12)re threat.
4.1.1 Determining factors
Besides threats which are giving rise to the considered
threat, the exploitation probability of corresponding vul-
nerabilities could be identi(cid:12)ed as in(cid:13)uencing factor. Since
the exploitation probabilities of corresponding vulnerabili-
g are merged in the intermediate vari-
ties fP PV1 , ..., P PVn
able P PV STi
, the degree of complexity of the posterior threat
probability calculation of Ti depends on the number of threat-

damental structure of the Bayesian network in a nutshell.
Table 1 shows the variables which are used in the following
calculation schema.
T is assumed to be the set of variables fT1, T2, ..., Tng
representing the threats which probabilities have to be de-
termined. It is assumed that each threat has exactly one of
a (cid:12)nite set of probability states (expressed as a vector, rep-
resenting the probability distribution among distinct states,
e.g. high, medium, and low). Since the threat probability
or in(cid:13)uencing factors cannot be determined quantitatively, a
qualitative rating is used in this approach. The main prob-
lem of quantitative methods is that they pretend an accuracy
which cannot be achieved by current estimation approaches.
In contrast to a quantitative rating with which it is hard-
ly possible to determine the occurrence of a certain threat
with a 67% and not with a 68% chance, a qualitative rating
(e.g. high, medium, and low) with clear state descriptions
helps users to estimate and handle a probability. To enable
humans to provide the necessary input and to understand
the corresponding output respectively, clear de(cid:12)nitions for
every possible variable state in the Bayesian network were
provided (cf.
[9]). For each variable a three-point Likert
scale [18] was de(cid:12)ned to capture the subjective impression-
s on the input variables (e.g., high (100), medium (0), low
(0)) and to represent the results by a distribution (e.g., high
(35), medium (25), low (40)) on the intermediate and output
variables. The Likert scale was used since it represents an
ordinal scale which allows to rank the scale characteristics
[8].
, ..., P TnTi
As already mentioned, the objective of the Bayesian net-
work is to determine the probability of threats taking var-
ious in(cid:13)uence factors into account. Therefore, the follow-
ing factors have been identi(cid:12)ed:
(1) predecessor threats
) in(cid:13)uence the considered threat (Ti) which
(P T1Ti
in(cid:13)uences its successor threats (ST1Ti
); therefore
dependencies amongst a given threat set T had to be con-
sidered (see the upper left section in Figure 2), (2) according
to [23], each threat (Ti) requires one or more vulnerabilities
(V1, ..., Vn) to become e(cid:11)ective; thus the existence of un-
mitigated vulnerabilities and their exploitation probability
signi(cid:12)cantly in(cid:13)uences the threat probability (see the lower
left section in Figure 2), (3) controls can be used to mitigate
identi(cid:12)ed vulnerabilities, while the mitigation depends on
the e(cid:11)ectiveness of a potential control combination (CCEVi )
which again depends on the actual e(cid:11)ectiveness of the con-

4.1.2 Calculation
The following function was used to incorporate threats
and vulnerabilities which in(cid:13)uence the posterior probability
of Ti, to calculate the conditional probability table of Ti and
⃗P PTi . In this model,
the posterior threat probability vector
the threat probability is written as a vector, representing the
distribution of probability values among the applied quali-
tative rating (e.g. high, medium, and low).

4.1.3 Rating
Each threat is rated by a qualitative system, allowing high,
medium, and low as possible threat probability values. Ac-
cording to [23], these values are de(cid:12)ned as follows: (1) High
- the threat source is highly motivated and su(cid:14)ciently capa-
ble (if it is a deliberate threat source) or has a high a priori
probability (if it is an non-deliberate threat source), and the
controls to prevent the vulnerability from being exercised
are ine(cid:11)ective, (2) Medium - the threat source is motivat-
ed and capable (if it is a deliberate threat source) or has a
medium a priori probability (if it is an non-deliberate threat
source), but controls are in place that may impede the suc-
cessful exercise of the vulnerability, and (3) Low - the threat
source lacks motivation and capability (if it is a deliberate
threat source) or has a low a priori probability (if it is an
non-deliberate threat source), and controls are in place to
prevent or at least signi(cid:12)cantly impede, the vulnerability
from being exercised.
4.1.4 Running example
In the context of the running example we want to show
how the threat probability for the data loss threat is calcu-
lated. According to Equation 1 we need the following input
values to calculate the posterior threat probability vector
⃗P PTDL for the data loss threat: (i) the exploitation proba-
bility vector of the corresponding intermediate vulnerability
variable (
), and (ii) the posterior probabilities of
⃗P PTAS and
its predecessor threats (alternation of software
⃗P PTAL ). The weight for each input variable is
asset loss
distributed equally. A visualization of the entire running
example is shown in Figure 3.

The following probability distribution has been calculated
for the data loss threat: fHigh=11.3333, Medium=59.3333,
Low=29.3333g. While the probability distributions for the
predecessor threats alternation of software and asset loss
are calculated in the same way the exploitation probability
⃗P PV STDL
vector of the intermediate vulnerability variable (
)
is calculated as described in the following subsection.
4.2 Intermediate Vulnerability Variable
The vulnerabilities exploitation probability vector
exploitation probability ratings of its parents f ⃗P PV1 , ...,
⃗P PV STi
represents an intermediate variable, which summarizes the
⃗P PVn
in order to decrease the probability calculation’s complexity
in the subsequent P PTi variable.
4.2.1 Determining factors
Since the variable V STi is just an intermediate variable;
the only factors determining its status are its parent vari-
g. Each vulnerability exploitation prob-
ables fP PV1 , ..., P PVn

4.2.2 Rating
To ensure a feasible degree of complexity the rating system
was limited to a three-point Likert scale allowing high, medi-
um, and low as possible vulnerability exploitation probabili-
ty values. The scale is derived from the (cid:12)ve-point vulnerabil-
ity scale according to [7]. Due to the fact that
only
⃗P PVi vectors, no further rating
⃗P PV STi
summarizes its connected
scale interpretation is given.
4.2.3 Running example
Since the considered data loss threat exploits only the no
backup strategy vulnerability the intermediate vulnerability

Vector
⃗P PVi expresses the exploitation probability of the
corresponding vulnerability Vi. If the vulnerability Vi is con-
nected to a threat which is initialized by a deliberate threat
⃗P PVi represents the probability of an attacker ex-
source,
ploiting this vulnerability. In the case of accidental threat
⃗P PVi represents the probability of the correspond-
sources,
ing vulnerability to be exploited by threat Ti.
4.3.1 Determining factors
First of all, the a priori probability
⃗APTi of the corre-
sponding threat Ti has to be de(cid:12)ned, excluding the consid-
eration of organization-speci(cid:12)c circumstances. In the case of
natural threats, data from local weather stations or historic
data about on natural disaster can be used to determine the
a priori probability of the threat. Statistics from insurance
companies or factors which could in(cid:13)uence human errors and
equipment malfunctions could help to estimate the proba-
bility of threats with an accidental threat source. While
these two examples are just suggestions, it is important to
explicitly de(cid:12)ne the scope of the data gathered. Statistics
used to determine the a priori probability of a given threat
should take the organization’s environment (e.g.
location,
culture, or legal issues) but not the speci(cid:12)c situation of the
organization (e.g.
implementation of speci(cid:12)c controls) into
account.
If the vulnerability Vi is connected to a threat Ti which is
initiated by a deliberate threat source, its posterior vulner-
⃗P PVi is determined
ability exploitation probability vector
by (1) the e(cid:11)ectiveness of an existing control combination
⃗CCEVi and (2) the e(cid:11)ectiveness of a potential attacker
⃗AEVi .
If Vi is connected to a threat Ti which is initiated by an ac-
cidental threat source, the determining factors are: (1) the
⃗CCEVi and (2) the a priori
control combination e(cid:11)ectiveness
⃗APVi , which is equal
vulnerability exploitation probability
⃗APTi of the corresponding
to the a priori threat probability
threat Ti.
4.3.2 Calculation
Calculating the posterior vulnerability exploitation prob-
⃗P PVi of Vi is always determined by the ef-
ability vector
⃗CCEVi and its
