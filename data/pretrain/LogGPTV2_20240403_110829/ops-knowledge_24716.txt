User: How to monitor and optimize system performance on a Linux server?
Assistant: 1. Use the top command to check the system resource usage. The top command can check the utilization of system resources in real time, and understand the load of the system, such as the usage of CPU, memory, and disk. 2. Use the sar command to view historical system performance data. The sar command can view the performance data of the CPU, memory, disk, and network in the history of the system, and use these data to analyze system bottlenecks and optimization solutions. 3. Use the vmstat command to check the system memory usage. The vmstat command can view system memory usage and process information, including virtual memory usage, cache status, etc., and can optimize memory usage. 4. Use the iostat command to check the system disk performance. The iostat command can view disk read and write conditions and performance indicators, including disk I/O, disk usage, etc., and can optimize disk performance. 5. Use the netstat command to check the network connection status of the system. The netstat command can check the system network connection status, transmission rate, network interface usage, etc., and can optimize the network performance of the system. 6. Regular system monitoring and optimization. Regularly monitor and optimize the above commands according to the actual situation to ensure the continuous stability and efficiency of the system.
