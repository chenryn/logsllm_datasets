User: I am in Windows and Suppose I have a main python code that calls python interpreter in command line to execute another python script ,say test.py .
So test.py is executed as a new process.How can I find the processId for this porcess in Python ?
Update:
To be more specific , we have os.getpid() in os module. It returns the current process id.
If I have a main program that runs Python interpreter to run another script , how can I get the process Id for that executing script ?
Assistant: Another option is that the process you execute will set a console window title for himself.
And the searching process will enumerate all windows, find the relevant window handle by name and use the handle to find PID.  It works on windows using ctypes.
