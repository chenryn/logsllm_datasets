Figure 16. DEMATEL Indirect Influence Summary.
This research suggests that IPv6 has the potential to be a more influential factor 
in strategic cyber security than three current cyber attack advantages, including 
asymmetry and inadequate cyber defense. This result is the most significant revela-
tion in this study.
DEMATEL analysis highlights two powerful IPv6 attributes. First, IPv6 is extremely 
resistant to outside influence, so it is more “reliable” than other factors in the system. 
Second, IPv6 influences the single most powerful cyber attack advantage, anonym-

ity, at a “very high” level. These factors combine, via indirect influence calculations, 
to radiate the impact of IPv6 throughout the system and to magnify its importance.
Thus, for decision makers, this research suggests that IPv6 is currently the single 
most efficient way to change the dynamics of strategic cyber security in favor of 
cyber defense.
Fig. 17 is a modified causal loop diagram which specifically highlights the signifi-
cant influence relationship between IPv6 and the rest of the system.

All three other mitigation strategies received negative scores in the final index (Fig. 
13), which means they are net receivers, and not providers, of influence in the sys-
tem. The second place mitigation strategy is the application of the world’s best mili-
tary doctrine, Art of War, to cyber conflict. It is the only other mitigation strategy to 
finish ahead of even one cyber attack advantage. Cyber arms control and deterrence 
remain at the bottom of the list, for reasons cited earlier in this book.
In summary, this analysis suggests that, even beyond the four cyber attack mitiga-
tion strategies evaluated by the author, decision makers could prioritize their invest-
ment in other mitigation strategies by category, according to the following formula.

Political
A technology-centric approach has a greater DEMATEL-calculated influence on the 
system of strategic cyber security due in part to the fact that it is more reliable than 
counting on a human-dependent approach – especially when politics come into play. 
Thus, IPv6 finished first in this list of strategies, and arms control (a hybrid politi-
cal/technical approach) moved ahead of deterrence (which relies only on political/
military factors) in the final calculation.

V. CONCLUSION
11. RESEARCH CONTRIBUTIONS
In the post-World War II era, cyber security has evolved from a technical discipline 
to a strategic concept. The power of the Internet, our growing dependence upon it, 
and the disruptive capability of cyber attackers now threaten national and interna-
tional security.
The nature of a security threat has not changed, but the Internet provides a new 
delivery mechanism that can increase the speed, scale, and power of an attack. 
National critical infrastructures are now at risk – not only during war, but also in 
times of peace. As a consequence, all future political and military conflicts will have 
a cyber dimension, whose size and impact are difficult to predict.
World leaders must address the threat of strategic cyber attacks with strategic re-
sponses in favor of cyber defense. In this book, the author examines four strategies 
that nation-states will likely adopt to mitigate the cyber attack threat: deterrence, 
arms control, doctrine, and technology.
Cyber attack deterrence lacks credibility because hacker skills are easy to acquire, 
and because attackers are often able to conduct high-asymmetry attacks even while 
remaining anonymous to their victims.
Cyber arms control appears unlikely, because cyberspace is too big to inspect, and 
malicious code is even hard to define. However, political will, perhaps in the wake of 
a future cyber attack, could change the status quo.
The world’s best military doctrine, Art of War, is more helpful than the first two 
strategies, but there are at least ten distinctive aspects of the cyber battlefield, none 
of which fits easily into Sun Tzu’s paradigm.
IPv6 answers some of our current security problems, but unfortunately it also cre-
ates new problems, including a necessarily long and dangerous transition phase.
However, in spite of the shortcomings of IPv6, the DEMATEL method clearly shows 
that among the four examined mitigation strategies, IPv6 is the most likely to have 
a tangible impact on reducing the key advantages of a cyber attacker, and thus it is 
the most likely strategy to improve a nation’s strategic cyber defense posture. The 
simple reason is that it can reduce the most influential advantage of a cyber attacker, 
anonymity, and it does so with a higher degree of reliability than the other factors 
156
CONCLUSION
in this research. Thus, the influence of IPv6 grows over time and impacts all other 
factors in strategic cyber security.
DEMATEL provided a way to analyze the four proposed mitigation strategies with 
scientific rigor. It calculated specific levels of influence for each key concept identi-
fied, and it created a causal loop diagram of the system they comprise. Finally, it 
calculated the most efficient way – among the four strategies in question – to reduce 
the threat of strategic cyber attack.
The contributions of this book are summarized as follows:
• an argument that computer security has evolved from a technical discipline 
to a strategic concept;
• the evaluation of four distinct strategic approaches to mitigate the cyber at-
tack threat and to improve a nation’s cyber defense posture;
• the use of the Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) to 
analyze this book’s key concepts; and
• the recommendation to policy makers of IPv6 as the most efficient of the four 
cyber defense strategies.
Suggestions for Future Research
The DEMATEL method has helped to clarify the landscape of strategic cyber secu-
rity. The author believes that DEMATEL could also be used to examine other out-
standing problems related to cyber security. Here are three possibilities:
Can a cyber attack be an act of war?461 The dynamic nature of cyberspace makes it 
difficult to predict the next cyber attack, or how serious it could be. An effects-based 
approach seems inevitable: if the level of human suffering or economic damage is 
high enough, national leaders will retaliate. This applies both to government and 
private sector critical infrastructures. A key challenge for national security planners 
is that the hacker tools and techniques required for cyber espionage are often the 
same as for cyber attack.462 The difference lies in motivation: does the hacker desire 
merely to steal information, or is the attack a prelude to war?
Can we solve the attribution problem? Smart hackers exploit the international, 
maze-like architecture of the Internet to conduct anonymous or deniable cyber at-
461 More precisely, the question may be whether a cyber attack could be considered an “armed attack” as 
specified by the UN Charter.
462 These may be differentiated by the terms computer network exploitation (CNE) and computer net-
work attack (CNA).
157
tacks. The trail of evidence often runs through countries with which the victim’s 
government has poor diplomatic relations or no law enforcement cooperation, and 
cyber investigations typically end at a hacked, abandoned computer, where the trail 
goes cold. This dynamic encourages “false flagging” operations – where the attacker 
tries to pin the blame on a third party – and creates an environment in which even 
terrorists can find a home on the Internet.463 Solving the attribution problem will 
require harmonizing cyber crime laws, improving cyber defense methods, and gen-
erating the political will to share evidence and intelligence.
Can we shift the advantage to cyber defense? Hackers today have enormous ad-
vantages over cyber defenders, including anonymity and asymmetry. In fact, if there 
is a future war between major world powers, a significant degree of the fighting 
may take place in cyberspace, and the first victim of the conflict could even be the 
Internet itself. To shift the balance, cyber defenders require a higher level of trust 
in hardware and software,464 improved performance metrics for defense strategies, 
and the ability to realistically model the hacker threat in a laboratory. Because it is 
impossible to eliminate all malicious code from a network, cyber defenders need 
better ways to neutralize what they cannot find. Governments could also require 
Internet Service Providers (ISP) to play a more helpful role in preventing the spread 
of malware.

development, can be almost impossible to detect by the end user.
