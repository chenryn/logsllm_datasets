I am experiencing an issue with Google App Engine's logging functionality. Until this morning, everything was working as expected. However, when I started my local server, none of my custom logging messages were being displayed. The only logs visible are the standard server GET messages. Even error messages are not being reported. I am unsure of what could be causing this problem.

Has anyone else encountered a similar issue? If so, could you please provide some guidance on how to resolve it?

**Update:**

Thank you, Abdul, for your input. Your suggestion helped me identify the root cause of the issue. I had mistakenly updated a URL in my application to point to the deployed version on Google App Engine (myapp.appspot.com/move) instead of my local development environment (localhost/move). This misconfiguration was preventing the logging from functioning correctly.
