User: I'm wondering if anyone has experienced problems with Google-App Engine's logging facility. Everything was working fine for me until this morning, I ran my local server and no logging messages were being displayed (well, none of my logging messages, the server GET messages etc.. are being displayed). Even errors are not being reported. I have no idea what is going on.
If this has happened to anyone, can you please advise on how to fix it?
Assistant: Thanks Abdul you made me realize what the problem is. I had changed a URL in my application to point to the application that I had deployed to Google-App Engine. It should have been pointing to my local application. I had myapp.appspot.com/move instead of localhost/move
