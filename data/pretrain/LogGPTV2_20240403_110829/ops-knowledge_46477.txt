User: What editors or IDEs offer decent autocompletion for wxPython on Windows or Linux? Are there any? I tried several and support is either non-existant or limited.
Assistant: try use brain to autocomplete... :)
just joking. when I coding in in PyQt4, I open qt-assistant and search the manual,
and wrap myclass like : MyButton = QPusuButton
I think it is impossible to use autocomplete in python,
because only in runtime the computer know what happens.
