A search for "school bus fight" returned over 500,000 xddeo links on YouTube. Adding a search term such as 
the city or school name may help, but it may also prohibit several wanted xddeos from appearing. The "Filter" 
option can be expanded to help limit the search scope. This button is above the first video result. This provides 
additional filter options including the ability to sort by the upload date (date range), type (video x7s. channel), 
duration (short or long), and features (video quality). In the "school bus fight" example, the "uploaded this 
week" option was chosen. This resulted in only 700 videos which could easily be examined for any intelligence. 
The lower left portion of any video page includes a link to the profile of the user who submitted this video. This 
profile page includes all of the videos uploaded by that user and additional profile information. Several YouTube 
"hacks" have surfaced over the years. Many of these stopped working as YouTube made changes to the 
environment. Of those still functioning, I find the following techniques helpful to my investigations.
The most popular xtideo-sharing site is YouTube. The official YouTube site declares that 500 hours of video are 
uploaded every minute, resulting in nearly 80 years of content uploaded ever}7 day. It further states that over a 
billion x'ideos are viewed each day. These impressive statistics confirm the need to include videos as part of a 
complete OSINT analysis. YouTube is easy to search from the main search field on ever}7 page. This field can 
accept any search term and will identify x'ideo content or username. Users that upload videos to YouTube have 
their own "channel". Their videos are uploaded to this channel, and locating a user's channel will identify the 
videos uploaded by that user.

It seems lately that every’ long YouTube video I play possesses a 30 second commercial at the beginning. This 
is very’ frustrating when analyzing a large number of videos. The same URL trick will byqaass this annoyance. 
Navigate to the following address and notice the commercial at the beginning.
Clicking "Download” should present the video directly’ from YouTube. The URL will be quite long. Please be 
warned that the content in this example contains very’ disturbing video, hence the blockage by YouTube.
Alter this address slightly in order to force the video to play in full screen in your browser. This will also bypass 
any commercials. The URL should appear like the following.
Many videos on YouTube are allowed to be viewed in some countries and blocked in others. If y'ou encounter 
a video that will not play’ for y’ou because of a country’ restriction, you have options. We will use the following 
video as a demonstration.

When a user uploads a video, YouTube captures and displays a frame for that media. This is the still frame you 
see w’hen searching videos and before a video is played. These possess a static URL, which will be helpful when 
we discuss reverse video searching. As an example, navigate to the following address to load a demo video.

Visiting this URL from a U.S. IP address should present" Video unavailable - The uploadcr has not made this

is restricted. After you have identified a video with possible country restrictions, paste the video ID into the

This presents a text-only view of all metadata associated with the target video (cgEnBkmcpuQ). While any 
YouTube video page displays estimated dates, like, dislikes, and comment counts, the metadata is more precise. 
The following is partial data extracted from our demonstration. I believe ever)' YouTube investigation should 
document all metadata.
The result is a page with a world map. Countries in grey are allowed to view the target video while countries in 
red are not. Another service which replicates this is WatanNetwork. The following URL displays their map.

at some point, bur I will keep the key used in the tools updated, 
now use this for tire following query based on our target video.
While I cannot natively play this video due to my location, I can easily view the default and high resolution still 
frames with the technique described in the previous section. The following exact URLs display content otherwise 
not viewable.
Most of the details of a YouTube video can be seen on the native page where the video is stored. Occasionally, 
some of this data may not be visible due to privacy settings or profile personalization. In order to confirm that 
you are retrieving all possible information, you should research the data visible from YouTube's servers. The 
most comprehensive way to do this is through Google’s YouTube API. Any Google account can request a free 
API key from Google at developers.google.com. You will need to create a new project and enable a YouTube 
API key. For your convenience and the search tools, I have already created the following key.
If a video is blocked from playing in your location, you can usually use a VPN which should allow viewing. 
Identify which countries are not blocked using the previous methods and select a server in one of those areas. 
The internet is full of "YouTube Proxy" websites which promise to play any blocked video, but I have found 
them to be unreliable.

You learned about reverse image searching in the previous chapter. Since YouTube allows us to extract frames 
from any video without playing the video itself, we can easily automate reverse image searching of those images. 
We already know that the maximum resolution image for our target video is available at 
https:/7i.ytimg.com/vi/cgEnBkmcpuQ/maxresdefault.jpg. Therefore, the following URL would conduct a 
reverse image search via Google, which should identify additional copies of this video. The Videos Tool will 
replicate this across Bing, Yandex, and TinEye using the methods explained in previous chapters.

This tells us the exact creation and modification times of each video along with viewer details. Again, this text 
can be helpful in our report. If you created your own API key as explained in the previous page, you can query 
more details. The following uses my own key and her Channel ID.
The results tell us she is in the United States ("country": "US") and has a custom YouTube URL at 
https://www.youtube.com/ShannonMorse f'customUrl": "shannonmorse"). Finally, we can retrieve a full-size 
image of her profile photo within this code. The following URL appears after "High". This links to a high- 
resolution (800x800) image of her profile picture, which is otherwise only available as a 160x160 icon. All of the 
search options on this page are available in the Videos Tool presented later.
If you ever locate a video of interest, you should investigate the profile which hosts the content. As stated earlier, 
even' YouTube video is associated with a profile. Clicking the uploaders name directly below a video should 
display this content. However, the profile page displays only a portion of available results. Let's conduct a 
demonstration. Assume you have identified a suspect video which is associated with the profile at 
https://www.youtube.com/user/SnubsieBoo. Viewing this page tells you that she has approximately 35,000 
subscribers and videos. However, we can dig deeper into her account with the following URL.

This URL presents 305 results, including links to the target video available within dozens of additional video 
platforms. While this works well on YouTube videos, complete reverse video searching across multiple networks 
will be explained later in this chapter. The search tools presented at the end automates all of these techniques.
My preferred method for extracting YouTube and other online videos was explained in previous chapters while 
discussing YouTube-DL and yt-dlp within a Linux, Mac, or Windows OSINT machine. This will always be 
the most stable and reliable option, and you should be proficient with the video download strategies 
explained within Chapter Four. However, if you have no software or browser plugins available to you, there 
is another easy option. While you are watching any YouTube video, you can add "deturl.com/" to the address 
in order to download the video to your computer. To test this, navigate to the following.
As a reminder, the Video Download Tool previously presented for Linux, Mac, and Windows possesses 
YouTube-Tool, which extracts comments from video pages. I believe this type of documentation should be a 
part of every investigation associated with a YouTube video.
Instead, we can find these lesser-known collections with YouTube Channel Crawler. Let's conduct an example 
demonstration. 1 queried the term "Guns" within YouTube, clicked the filters option, and chose to only display 
Channels. 1 received numerous results, and every Channel featured over 100,000 subscribers. I would never find 
my target there. Now, let's use our crawler. I chose the term of "Guns", no limit to the results, a maximum of 
40 subscribers and 40 total views, and did not specify a date

As previously explained, anyone can search YouTube and filter by Channels. This allows you to only see results 
which possess one or more videos within a designated Channel. Unfortunately, the results place emphasis on 
the most popular channels. Within an investigation, it is much more likely that your target will not have 
thousands of views or followers. Instead, a channel with no subscribers is more common. Finding these poorly- 
visited channels is quite difficult with official search options.

YouTube videos can be classified as "Public", "Private", or "Unlisted". Public videos appear within YouTube 
search results; private videos require an invitation from the host; and unlisted videos sit in between. Unlisted 
videos will not appear within search results, but they can be seen by anyone possessing the direct URL. There 
are two methods to discover unlisted videos. First, we can conduct a search on Google such as the following.
This can be unreliable, as it presents videos which contain "This video is unlisted" within the description 
provided by the uploader. I find Unlisted Videos (unlistedvideos.com) to be more reliable. Conduct a keyword 
search on this site to identify videos which are unlisted and not present within search results.
YouTube is not the only video sharing service on the internet Wikipedia identifies dozens of these sites, but 
searching each of them can become tedious. These sites are no longer restricted to pages of video files with 
standard extensions such as mp4, mpg, and flv. Today, sendees such as Instagram allow embedded videos which 
do not conform to yesterday's video standards. Many new sendees present the viewer with animated gif files 
that only appear as true videos. Fortunately, search engines like Google, Bing, and Yandex offer a search across 
all of the types.
In 2020, Yandex's video search option became a contender for OSINT usage. While Google an mg are 
constantly removing videos, which violate their policies associated with violent and inappropriate content, 
Yandex seems to allow anything. Similar to my recommendations for general search and images, an ex

The Internet Archive has been mirroring YouTube videos for years and often possesses their own independent 
copies. We can look for this with the following URL.
When you locate videos embedded within social networks, use the previous methods to download any evidence. 
I always start with the Video Download Tool. If it is a live stream, I use the Video Stream Tool. If neither are 
available or functioning, browser extensions may work. If you get desperate, try various free third-part}’ tools 
such as Twitter Video Downloader (twittervideodownloader.com), FDown (fdown.net), and Instagram 
Downloader (igram.io).

remove their YouTube videos. This often happens when unwanted 
user regrets the post. The following technique wall not always work, but I have 
own investigations. Consider the following video which has been removed from
Google, Bing, and Yandex index social networks for video pages, but these search engines can never replicate 
internal queries through popular networks such as Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, and others. We should always 
consider a keyword search direcdy within these services. The following assumes "osint" is your search term and 
provides a direct URL for each network query.
Twitter: https://twitter.com/search?q=osint&f=video
Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/search/videos/?q=osint

There was a brief mention earlier of conducting a reverse image search on the still captures of a YouTube video. 
This would use the same techniques as mentioned in Chapter Twenty-One for images. While there is no official 
reverse video search option, applying the techniques to still captures of videos can provide amazing results. This 
method is not limited to YouTube. We can conduct reverse image searches on videos from many sites. As the 
popularity of online videos is catching up to images, we must always consider reverse video searches. They will 
identify additional websites hosting the target videos of interest. Before explaining the techniques, consider the 
reasons that you may want to conduct this type of activity.
This identifies 276 captures of this video page. However, these are HTML archives, and the video will not play 
within any of them. These pages are beneficial for locating comments associated with your target video, but not 
for the video content itself. We can use the following URL to play the full resolution version of the archived 
video.
We can now right-click on the video to save our own offline copy. You would only need to replace your target 
YouTube video ID with the one listed here (9ZmsnTDLykk). Our search tools will replicate this for you at the 
end of the chapter.

YouTube: As explained earlier, YouTube offers four sdll frames for every video uploaded plus a high-resolution 
image. Obtain the URLs oudined during that instruction, and provide each to Google, Bing, Yandex, TinEyc, 
and Baidu as a reverse image search as previously explained. The Videos Tool presented later will automate this 
process.
Vimeo: Vimeo does not natively offer URLs with a video ID that display screen captures of multiple frames. 
However, they do provide a single high definition still capture for every’ video. This is stored in the Application 
Programming Interface (API) side of Vimeo, but it is easy to obtain. As an example, consider your target is at 
https://vimeo.com/99199734. The unique ID of 99199734 is assigned to that video. You can use that number
