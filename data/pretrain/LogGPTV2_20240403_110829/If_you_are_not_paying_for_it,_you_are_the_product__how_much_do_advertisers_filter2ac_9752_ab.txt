the (cid:128)nal charge price. Popular ad-exchanges include: DoubleClick,
MoPub, and OpenX.
Demand-Side Platform (DSP): is an agency platform, which em-
ploys decision engines with sophisticated audience targeting and
optimization algorithms aiming to help advertisers buy the best-
matched ad slots from ADXs in a simple, convenient and uni(cid:128)ed
way. DSPs retrieve and process user data from several sources (step
4) such as ADXs, Data Hubs, etc. (cid:140)e result of this processing is
translated to a decision in practice: How much is it worth to bid for
an ad slot for this user, if any? If the visitor’s pro(cid:128)le matches the
audience the advertiser has focused his ad-campaign on, the DSP
will submit to the ADX the impression and a bid in CPM (cost per
1000 impressions [38], typically in USD or Euro) on behalf of the ad-
vertiser (step 5). Popular DSPs are MediaMath, Criteo, DoubleClick,
AppNexus and Invite Media.
User Data Hub, Data Exchange Platform (DXP): is a central-
ized data warehouse such as a Data Management Platform (DMP) [9,
45] or a Data Broker [49] which aggregates, cleans, analyzes and
maintains user private data such as demographics, device (cid:128)nger-
prints, interests, online and o(cid:132)ine contextual and behavioral in-
formation [40, 41]. (cid:140)ese user data are typically aggregated in two
formats: 1) a full, audience user pro(cid:128)le for o(cid:132)ine analytics and data
mining, 2) a run-time user pro(cid:128)le, optimized for real-time requests
such as RTB queries from DSPs, before submi(cid:138)ing their bids to
ADXs [18, 42] (step 4).
Such user pro(cid:128)les are sold to ad entities [5] because they increase
the value of an RTB inventory by enabling a more behavioral-
targeted advertising (2.7× more e(cid:130)ective than non-targeted adver-
tising [6, 82]). In fact, Data Hubs are considered the core component
of the digital ad-ecosystem as they perform the a(cid:138)ribution and la-
beling of users’ data and create groups, namely audience segments,
which are useful (i) to the publishers for their customer under-
standing, (ii) to the SSPs for retrieving more re-targeted ads and
(iii) to the DSPs for feeding their bid decision engines. Further,
quality scores are impartially assigned to users’ private data based
on the success of ad-campaigns they were used, thus driving the
bid prices of future ad-campaigns. Notable DXPs are Turn, Adobe,
Krux, Bluekai, Lotame.
2.2 RTB price noti(cid:128)cation channel
When an ADX selects the winning bid of an auction, the corre-
sponding bidder must be noti(cid:128)ed about its win to log the successful

entry and the price to be paid to the ADX. One could implement
this noti(cid:128)cation in two ways: (i) with a server-to-server message
between ADX and DSP, (ii) with a noti(cid:128)cation message conjoined
with the price, passed through the user’s browser as a call-back to
the DSP.
(cid:140)e (cid:128)rst option is straightforward and tamper-proof; no one can
modify or block these messages, allowing companies to ensure that
their logs are fully synced at any time. In addition, DSPs can hide
information about the transactions, the purchased ad-slots and the
prices paid from the prying eyes of competitors. However, DSPs
do not have any indication of the delivery of each ad, in order to
inform their campaigns and budget.
Instead, the second option not only can ensure the DSP that the
winning impression was indeed delivered (the callback is (cid:128)red soon
a(cid:137)er the impression is rendered on the user’s device), but also gives
the opportunity to drop a cookie on the user’s device. (cid:140)erefore,
the second option is the dominant one in the current market: the
ADX piggybacks a noti(cid:128)cation URL (nURL) in the ad-response,
which delivers to the user the winning impression and the ad (steps
6 and 7 in Figure 1). (cid:140)is nURL includes basically the winning
DSP’s domain, the charge price, the impression ID, the auction ID
and other relevant logistics (see Table 1 for some examples). In
this present work, we study such nURLs and the prices embedded
in them, as well as how they associate with the users’ browsing
behavior and other personal information.
2.3 Encrypted vs. cleartext prices
Although in the early years of RTB, all charge prices in nURLs
were in cleartext, we see that nowadays more and more companies
deliver charge prices in encrypted form (see examples in Table 1).
While cleartext prices captured at the user’s browser can be easily
tallied to estimate the total cleartext cost, the same does not apply
for the encrypted prices. (cid:140)e popular 28-byte encryption scheme
companies use cannot be easily broken [26].
Previous studies [62] assumed that encrypted prices follow the
same distribution as cleartext ones. Indeed, one may argue that the
price encryption is just to avoid tampering of reported prices, so
encrypted prices probably follow the cleartext price distribution.
However, encryption provides also con(cid:128)dentiality to the bidding
strategy. (cid:140)us, possible use of encryption in charge prices may be
also a sign of a higher value that the bidder wants to hide: aggres-
sive re-targeting because of user’s previous incomplete purchases,
targeting users with higher spending habits, or users with special-
ized needs (e.g., sensitive products, expensive drugs, etc.). Hence, a
bidder (e.g. a DSP) may choose encryption to reduce transparency

3 METHODOLOGY
In this section, we describe our proposed methodology, with which
a user u can estimate in real-time the accumulated cost Vu for the
ads she was delivered while browsing the web (§ 3.1) (notations
used are summarized in Table 2). Following this methodology, we
design our system based on two main components: (i) a remote Price
Modeling Engine (§ 3.2) and (ii) a user-side tool, namely YourAdValue
(§ 3.3). Figure 4 presents an overview of our proposed methodology.
3.1 Overall cost of the user’s data
(cid:140)e overall ad-cost of the user for time period T is the sum of charge
prices the advertisers have paid a(cid:137)er evaluating her personal data
they have collected and delivering ads to her device. Speci(cid:128)cally,
this overall value is the sum of both her cleartext Cu(T) and en-
crypted Eu(T) prices and can be stated as:
Vu(T) = Cu(T) + Eu(T)
(1)
(cid:140)e cleartext prices of a user can be aggregated in a straightforward
fashion, thus producing the ad-cost for user u over such prices:
ci , where i ∈ SCu(T)
(2)
Cu(T) =
i
On the other hand, the calculation of the aggregated Eu(T) of
the encrypted prices for the same user is not easy. (cid:140)e actual price
values ei are hidden and therefore need to be estimated. To achieve
that, we leverage the metadata of each charge price in the user’s
set SEu(T) of encrypted price noti(cid:128)cations. Such metadata may
include: time of day, day of week, size of ad, DSP/ADX involved,
location, type of device, associated IAB, type of OS, user’s interests,
etc. All these metadata are collected in a feature vector Fi that
captures the context of a speci(cid:128)c charge price ei in nURLi.
In order to estimate each encrypted noti(cid:128)cation price i, we built a
machine learning model, which receives as input the feature vector
Fi (or a subset Si ⊆ Fi), extracted from the nURLi, and estimates
a charge price ESe(Si) for the encrypted price ei. (cid:140)is permits us
then to aggregate the estimated encrypted prices for user u as we
have done for the cleartext ones:
ESe(Si), where i ∈ SEu(T)
(3)
i
3.2 Price Modeling Engine
(cid:140)e core element of our solution, the Price Modeling Engine (PME),
is a centralized repository responsible for the estimation of en-
crypted prices. To achieve this, the PME requires a sample of

over its bidding strategies, or possible special knowledge it may
have about a speci(cid:128)c user, thus preventing an external observer or
competitor from assessing its bidding methods and ad-campaigns.
We should note that encryption is not a feature that comes for
free. (cid:140)ere are signi(cid:128)cant costs for the participating parties such
as more computation and storage overhead, energy consumption
and higher imposed latency. (cid:140)erefore, these costs alone could be
a reason for an ADX to charge more for providing the bene(cid:128)ts of
encryption to a DSP. Considering all the aforementioned, in our
study, we remove the need for making any assumptions regard-
ing encrypted prices and allows us to account for any potential
di(cid:130)erences between cleartext and encrypted prices.
2.4 Encrypted prices on the rise
Encryption is a regular practice in desktop RTB ads (∼68% as re-
ported in [61] with major supporters being DoubleClick, Rubicon-
Project and OpenX). By analyzing a weblog of 1600 real mobile users
(see Section 4), we detected a smaller portion in mobile RTB ads
(∼26%). However, we found that the percentage of ADX-DSP pairs
using encrypted price nURLs was steadily increasing through time
(Figure 2), which means that more and more mobile advertising
entities have started using nURLs with encrypted prices.
In fact, we found that the mobile advertising entities with the
larger RTB shares deliver the highest portion of cleartext prices as
well (Figure 3). For example, MoPub and Adnxs, the two leading
ad-entities in our dataset, are responsible for 33.55% and 10.74% of
the overall RTB ads detected, respectively (x-axis). (cid:140)ey are also
responsible for 45.40% and 5.45% for the cleartext prices detected,
respectively (cumulatively in y-axis). If these two (or more) com-
panies (cid:131)ipped their strategy from cleartext to encrypted, it would
dramatically impact the RTB-ecosystem’s transparency and hinder
price information exposed to an external auditor or the involved
user.
Given these trends in mobile and desktop, we expect that in the
near future RTB auctions will dominate, and many of the ad-entities
will use encryption to deliver their charge prices. Our methodology
anticipates these trends and promotes be(cid:138)er transparency in online
advertising and usage of user personal data. (cid:140)is methodology al-
lows end-users to accurately estimate on their browser, at real-time,
