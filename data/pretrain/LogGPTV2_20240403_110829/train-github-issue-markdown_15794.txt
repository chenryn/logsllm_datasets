# Summary of the new feature/enhancement
Enhance FancyZones to support seamless multi-monitor snap capability,
equivalent to what Windows 10's built-in Snap function supports.
# Description
Currently, Win10's built-in Snap feature, although extremely limited in
configurability, allows windows to be freely snapped between multiple
monitors. FancyZones greatly enhances configurability, but reduces
functionality by presently only allowing apps to be snapped around the monitor
they are currently positioned on. (This is most evident if the FancyZones
option `Override Windows Snap hotkeys (win+arrow) to move windows between
zones` has been enabled.)
While It is possible to manually drag windows to other monitors where they can
then be snapped, this undermines Snap's inherent efficiency.
It would be greatly beneficial to enhance FancyZones enabling it reproduce the
multi-monitor snapping ability provided by Windows 10 out-of-the box,
increasing efficiency vs current state and improving seamless operation vs
Windows 10 alone.
