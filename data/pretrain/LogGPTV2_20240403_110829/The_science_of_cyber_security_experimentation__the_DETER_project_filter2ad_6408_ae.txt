will extend the results of earlier topics by applying to them some 
of the advances that we are making in our current research work. 
Risky experiment management is one area of prior work that also 
occupies  a  place  in  the  roadmap.  To  put  into  practice  the 
management  approach  described  in  Section  3.3,  we  will  need  to 
(a) develop DeterLab facilities for an experimenter to develop and 
refine  specifications  of  their  experiment’s  requirements  for 
Controlled  Internet  Access,  and  (b)  develop  automation  tools  to 
create an experiment-specific gateway node. The automation tools 
will need to both implement the experimenter’s requirements, and 
also  implement  DeterLab’s  constraints  defined  in  the  T1/T2 
approached described in Section 3.3. 
For  risky  experiment  management,  this  future  elaboration  will 
depend on the results of two areas of current research activity. The 
modeling  and  specification  work  (described  in  Section  4.3)  will 
provide  key  elements  of  the  experimenter  facility  to  define 
constraints and invariants on the experiment’s communication via 
controlled  internet  access.  The  container  work  (described  in 
Section  4.2)  will  enable  DETER  project  research  staff  to  create 
reusable  building  blocks  for  gateway  implementation,  each  with 
advertisements that will assist the automation tools in constructing 
a  container  to  serve  as  a  gateway  node  that  implements  the 
required  controls  for  controlled  internet  access  as  needed  by  the 
particular experiment. 
A  second  part  of  the  research  roadmap  is  elaboration  of  prior 
work  on  federation,  to  support  a  new  form  of  DeterLab 
experimentation.  A  multi-party  experiment  is  one  in  which  the 
experimental  apparatus  is  built  from  sub-components  that  are 
federated  to  create  the  whole,  and  each  federant  has  complete 
information  only  about  their  own  sub-component,  with  only 
partial  information  about  other  sub-components.  This  form  of 
experiment can be used to model several different kinds of cyber-
defense situations: adversarial situations (e.g. red-team/blue-team 
exercises);  realistic  forensic  or  defense  scenarios  (e.g.,  attack 
information  about  attacker);  or  partial 
target  with 
separate  organizations 
collaboration 
collaborate  on  defense  without  granting  full  visibility 
to 
collaborators. 
Support  for  multi-party  experimentation  will  depend  on  the 
current full-production federation capability in DeterLab, and the 
results of several areas of current DETER research: modeling and 
specification  work  (described  in  Section  4.3)  to  state  constraints 
and invariants on activities of each party; and the container work 
(described  in  Section  4.2),  which  is  essential  to  scale  out  each 
party’s sub-apparatus to realistic proportions needed for the types 
of multi-party experiments currently envisioned.

Experimental Cybersecurity Research 
Paradigm 
The above areas of current research and future research roadmap 
provide  the  foundation  for  our  program  towards  new  science 
based experimental cybersecurity.  Our focus is work is extending  
DeterLab new capabilities resulting from work in these areas, as 
well  as  integrating  the  new  and  existing  capabilities.  The 
integration  is  critical,  including  functional  integration  with  the 
new  ELM  workbench;  but  more  important  is  integration  into  a 
new  methodology  for  the  experiment  lifecycle.  Five  of  several 
possible lifecycle phases are illustrated in Figure 7:

5.  SUMMARY 
The DETER project is continuing with its research program, much 
of which has been described in brief in this paper. Our research 
target continues to be the technology and methodology needed for 
the practice of cyber-security research to become an experimental 
science, with rigorous experiment design, construction, execution, 
interpretation,  sharing,  and  repeatability  of  experiments.  We 
believe  that  such  a  transformation  of  cyber-security  research  is 
needed to expand and accelerate the research community’s efforts. 
Expansion and acceleration are becoming increasingly important, 
as  inter-connected  cyber  systems  continue  to  expand  into  nearly 
every area of human infrastructure, from critical infrastructure for 
communication, finance, transportation, and power, to networked 
computing  systems  that  are  intimately  integrated  into  our  lives: 
our  vehicles,  our  handheld  wireless  personal  computing  and 
communications  (“smart  phones”),  regulation  of  our  homes’ 
utility use (“smart meters”), remote control and regulation of our 
homes’ fixtures (“smart grid”) including safety-critical appliances, 
as  well  as   our  healthcare,  and  even  our  bodies,  with  networked 
controllers for implanted medical devices. 
From  national  and  international  security  to  personal  safety,  the 
number and variety of targets continues to increase along with an 
accelerating  expansion  of  the  total  attack  surface  available  to 
adversaries who have an increasingly powerful portfolio of tools 
and  customers.  When  the  DETER  project  started,  cyber-security 
technology  development  and  technology  transfer  were  often 
resource intensive, and often lacking in proactive approaches for 
asset  protection  to  be  sufficient  to  increase  the  level  of  cyber 
defense of critical assets. In the past 8 years, we have built some 
significant  infrastructure  for  the  development  and  test  of  new 
cyber-defenses. As we look ahead to the coming years, we expect 
that transformation of research tools and methods will contribute 
to the much needed expansion and acceleration of research, which 
can  lead  to  an  accelerated  pace  of  deployment  of  scientifically 
tested and effective cyber-defenses. 
Continuing  maturation  of  the  DeterLab  facility  is  necessary,  but 
so is the accelerated growth of a cyber-security research and test 
community  that  can  rapidly  leverage  one  another’s  work.  In 
addition  to  the  research  and  methods  described  in  this  paper, 
further  development  of  the  cyber-security  experiment  science 
community is a critical shared responsibility of the larger cyber-
security community.
