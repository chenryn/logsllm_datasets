If I understand things correctly, under ES6, the second line should raise a
referenceError due to x not yet having been declared.
    "use strict";
    let b = x; // should throw a referenceError
    console.log('b: ', b);
    b = 2;
    const x = 'a';
Running this through Babel, I get no referenceError. But the following code
does raise a referenceError:
    "use strict";
    let b = x; // throws a referenceError
    console.log('b: ', b);
    b = 2;
