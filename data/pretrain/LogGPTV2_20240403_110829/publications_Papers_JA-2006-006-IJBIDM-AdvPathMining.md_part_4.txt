On average, the Multimethod approach outperforms all other single methods. It is particularly effective with a smaller number of attributes. As the number of attributes increases, the accuracy of Naïve Bayes improves. The results for specific experiments are shown in Figure 8, where experiments with an accuracy below 70% are not presented.

### 4.16 Graphical Comparison
Figure 9 provides a graphical comparison of the Multimethod and Naïve Bayes approaches. Dots above the line indicate that the classifier performed better than all others.

Naïve Bayes produced more accurate results when a more appropriate set of attributes was used. Initially, the Multimethod approach did not include Naïve Bayes and SMO classifiers. However, when these were added to the Multimethod framework, the proposed solution included a decision tree, Naïve Bayes, and SMO. All classifiers achieved their highest accuracy in experiment 15, which includes the four most informative attributes. The results are summarized in Table 5.

### 4.17 Best Results Comparison
| Method | Max Accuracy (%) | Experiment | Number of Attributes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| J48 | 93.41 | 15 | 4 |
| Naïve Bayes (NB) | 96.41 | 15 | 4 |
| SMO | 93.11 | 15 | 4 |
| Multimethod (MM) | 94.61 | 15 | 4 |
| MM with NB and SMO | 96.71 | 15 | 4 |

### 4.18 Rationale for Excluding Naïve Bayes and SMO Initially
The initial exclusion of Naïve Bayes and SMO from the Multimethod approach was based on the idea of using only symbolic approaches, ensuring the final result had a symbolic knowledge representation. Including Naïve Bayes and SMO would have resulted in a non-symbolic solution, making the comparison meaningless. Our results demonstrate that we can achieve high accuracy using symbolic representations. Adding additional methods expands the search space and enhances the expressive power of the Multimethod approach.

### 4.19 Computational Efficiency
The Multimethod approach combines different search space strategies, requiring significant computational resources. Consequently, it is not as fast as other methods in generating hypotheses.

### 8. Related Work
Our work integrates path mining analysis and efficient data mining algorithms. This section discusses related work in three areas: process mining, data mining, and the intersection of process, data, and path mining.

#### 8.1 Process Mining and Process Path Prediction
Most research in this area focuses on process mining, using process logs to discover process models. Key contributions include:
- **Aalst et al. (2003)**: A detailed survey of process mining techniques.
- **Herbst and Karagiannis (1998)**: A machine learning component for acquiring and adapting workflow models.
- **Weijters and van der Aalst (2001)**: A process mining technique for discovering workflow models from event-based data.
- **Agrawal et al. (1998)**: An algorithm for modeling business processes from workflow logs.
- **Grigoria et al. (2004)**: A Business Process Intelligence (BPI) tool suite for process execution support.

Path prediction contributions, such as those by Cardoso (2002) and Cardoso et al. (2004), are limited to simple statistical techniques. Advanced data mining algorithms offer more accurate predictions.

#### 8.2 Data Mining and the Multimethod Approach
Combining data mining techniques with a meta-level approach has been successful in various domains, often using a black box approach. Examples include:
- **AdaBoost (Freund and Schapire, 1996)**: A boosting method.
- **Bagging and MultiBoost (Webb, 2000)**: Combines boosting and wagging.
- **KBANN (Towell and Shavlik, 1995)**: Maps symbolic rules into neural networks.
- **INLEN (Michalski, 1997)**: Applies a multistrategy approach based on Inferential Theory of Learning.
- **HHL (Lee and Shin, 1999)**: Uses inductive logic programming for learning rules from large databases.

#### 8.3 Process Mining, Data Mining, and Path Mining
Compared to existing approaches, our work focuses on path mining, where the process model is known. Process mining aims to discover process models from logs, while we focus on predicting Quality of Service (QoS) during the monitoring phase. Grigoria et al. (2004) target process analysis and optimization but do not consider path mining. Our research uses advanced data mining algorithms, such as the Multimethod, which dynamically combines different methods.

### 9. Conclusions
Business Process Management Systems (BPMS) and workflows generate valuable data that can be used to extract knowledge about process executions and behavior. Path mining, the prediction of process paths, is crucial for QoS analysis and prediction. We compared several data mining algorithms, including J48, Naïve Bayes, SMO, and the Multimethod. The experimental results show that the Multimethod outperforms other methods in path mining, making it a suitable solution for administrative and production processes.
