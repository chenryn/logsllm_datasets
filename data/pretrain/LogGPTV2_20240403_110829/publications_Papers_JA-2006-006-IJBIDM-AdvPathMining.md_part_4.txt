On average the Multimethod approach performs better then all other single methods
when compared to each other. It can be observed that the Multimethod approach
produces better results with smaller numbers of attributes. When the number of attributes
is increased the accuracy of Naïve Bayes improves. Accuracy for concrete experiments is
shown in Figure 8. Experiments that produced an accuracy less than 70% are not
presented.
Figure 9 Graphical comparison of the Multimethod and Naïve Bayes. The dots above the line
mean that the classifier performed better than all other classifiers
We can observe that Naïve Bayes produced more accurate results when a more
appropriate set of attributes was proposed. The Multimethod approach did not include
the Naïve Bayes and SMO classifiers in those experiments. This situation was changed
when we have the SMO and the NB to the Multimethod framework. A proposed solution
given by the Multimethod approach was composed of a decision tree, Naïve Bayes, and a
SMO classifier. All the classifiers produced the highest accuracy in experiment n°15,
since this experiment includes the 4 most informative attributes. The results are presented
in Table 5.

Why did we not include the Naïve Bayes and SMO methods in the Multimethod from the
beginning? Following the idea of the Multimethod, we have only used symbolic
approaches, so the final result had a symbolic knowledge representation. If we had
included the Naïve Bayes and the SMO methods, the resulting solution (if there would be
no better one) would be either for Naïve Bayes or SMO, which also implies that
comparison with the method would not have made any sense. We were able to show
that we can get very good results by using other (symbolic) knowledge representations
using different methods. Of course, when we include an additional method search space,
the expressive power of the Multimethod approach is increased.
We should also stress that the Multimethod approach combines different search space
approaches, using quite a large amount of processing power, and it is not as fast in
producing hypotheses as the other methods.
8 Related work
Since our work combines two important areas, path mining analysis and efficient data
mining algorithms, we divide this section into three subsections to discuss the related
work in each area and in the area that interrelates process mining, data mining, and path
mining.
8.1 Process mining and process path prediction
Most of the research in this area has targeted process mining. The techniques and
algorithms developed use information stored in process logs to discover process models.
Process mining is addressed in several papers and a detailed survey of this research area
is provided in Aalst et al. (2003).
In Herbst and Karagiannis (1998) a machine learning component able to acquire and
adapt a workflow model from observations of manually enacted workflow instances is
described. The component is able to generalise a number of execution traces from
different workflow instances to a single more general workflow model covering all
traces.
In Weijters and van der Aalst (2001) a process mining technique is presented.
The technique allows the discovery of workflow models from a workflow log containing
information about the workflow process as it is actually being executed. The procedure
includes three steps, the construction of the dependency/frequency table, induction of
dependency/frequency graphs (D/F-graphs), and the generation of WF-nets from
D/F-graphs. Their experiments on six noise free workflow logs showed that their method
created six perfect D/F-graphs.
Web process and workflow path mining using the Multimethod approach 325
In Agrawal et al. (1998) an algorithm that allows the user to use existing workflow
execution logs to automatically model a given business process as a graph is presented.
The algorithm has been applied to synthetic datasets as well as logs obtained from a
workflow management system (Flowmark) installation. The results showed that the
graphs the algorithm derived in experiments were very good approximations of
the original graph.
In Grigoria et al. (2004), a set of integrated tools that use data mining algorithms to
support process execution by providing several features, such as analysis, prediction,
monitoring, control, and optimisation is presented. The set of tools is referred to as the
Business Process Intelligence (BPI) tool suite.
A few contributions exist in the field of path prediction (Cardoso, 2002;
Cardoso et al., 2004), however, they are limited to estimating of process’ QoS based on
simple statistical techniques. We will show that advanced data mining algorithm are more
accurate in predicting execution paths.
8.2 Data mining and the Multimethod approach
The idea of combining data mining techniques with a meta-level approach has been
successfully applied on different domains, but mostly using a black box approach.
Examples of approaches include AdaBoost (Freund and Schapire, 1996), Bagging and
MultiBoost (Webb, 2000). This last method combines boosting and wagging.
Most of the research has been concentrated on improving and developing new
methods with single or specific combinations of knowledge representations. For example,
the hybrid system KBANN (Towell and Shavlik, 1995) maps symbolic rules into neural
networks. The rules are used to determine the topology of the initial network, which
serves as a good starting point for training.
INLEN (Michalski, 1997) applies a multistrategy approach based on Inferential
Theory of Learning (Michalski, 1994) by simulating human learning and applying similar
transformations to the knowledge base. Users must specify an appropriate transformation,
using a knowledge generation language, to transform knowledge and produce different
ontologies. The Multimethod approach follows a similar idea, but it is applied to the field
of automatic knowledge extraction from learning instances.
HHL (Lee and Shin, 1999) applies the inductive logic programming algorithm
by sequentially using multiple strategies for learning rules in a restricted first-order logic
from very large databases. The process is executed with user interaction that selects
appropriate hierarchies to direct the learning process.
8.3 Process mining, data mining, and path mining
Compared to the approaches discussed in the previous sections, our work focuses on path
mining, and not process mining. In path mining, the process model is known. On the
other hand, process mining has the goal of discovering process models from BPMS logs,
addressing the design phase of processes. We aim at the monitoring phase, where we
predict the QoS of process instances.
The work which is most comparable to ours is described in Grigoria et al. (2004).
Their work targets process analysis, prediction, monitoring, control, and optimisation.
Nevertheless, they have not contemplated path mining analysis. Moreover, they carry
out process analysis experiments with traditional data mining techniques. In our research,
326 J. Cardoso and M. Lenič
we realise experiments with new and improved data mining algorithms, such as the
Multimethod which dynamically combines different methods into hybrids using tight
coupling between the methods by sharing knowledge.
9 Conclusions
Business Process Management Systems, workflow systems, workflows, web processes,
and web services represent fundamental technological infrastructures that efficiently
define, manage, and support business processes. The data generated from the execution
and management of processes, which is usually stored in a log system, is valuable and
can be used to discover and extract knowledge about processes’ executions, behaviour,
and structure.
In this paper we have shown that one important area of research related to processes
is the prediction of the paths that will be followed during the execution of a process
instance. We call this type of prediction ‘path mining’.
We have shown and illustrated how path mining can be achieved using data mining
techniques to automatically extract path knowledge from process logs. Path mining
knowledge is indispensable for Quality of Service (QoS) analysis and prediction.
Organisations operating in modern markets, such as e-commerce activities and
distributed web services interactions require QoS management. Appropriate control of
quality leads to the creation of quality products and services; these, in turn, fulfill
customer expectations and achieve customer satisfaction.
Due to the increased importance of QoS management for organisations, we have
compared several data mining algorithms to carry out path mining. J48 was selected
as a good representative of a symbolic method, Naïve Bayes as a representative of a
probabilistic method, SMO a as representative of a method that has been successfully
applied in the domain of text-mining, and the Multimethod as a representative of a new
method that dynamically combines and applies different methods (heuristic and search
space learning methods) in no predefined order to the path mining problem.
The experimental results were encouraging. The results presented in this paper show
that the Multimethod outperforms in practice the J48, Naïve Bayes, and SMO when
applied to the path mining problem. The Multimethod approach has been previously
tested and applied successfully on medical domains. From our experiments, we can
conclude that the Multimethod approach is also a good solution to perform path mining
on administrative and production processes.
