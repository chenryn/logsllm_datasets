I am attempting to integrate Next.js with Firebase Cloud Functions. When I test the application locally, it functions perfectly without any issues. However, during deployment, I encounter an error related to the following line of code:

```javascript
const app = next({ dev: false });
```

When this line is included, my functions fail to deploy, and I receive the following error message:

```
Deploy Error: Function load error: Error: cannot communicate with function.
```

This is puzzling because I do not experience this issue during local testing. If I comment out the problematic line, the functions deploy successfully, but then I am unable to use Next.js.

Interestingly, this error occurs even when I do not use any Next.js features in my functions. Simply declaring the line `const app = next({ dev: false });` prevents the deployment.

Does anyone have any suggestions on how to resolve this issue?
