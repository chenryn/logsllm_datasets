I am trying to make nextjs works together with firebase cloud functions.
When i am testing locally, there is no problem my app works perfectly.
However when i am deploying there is an error related to this line
`const app = next({ dev : false })`
When i put this line, my functions cannot be deployed and i get this message
`Deploy Error: Function load error: Error: cannot communicate with function.`
I don't understand because i don't have this issue in local testing.
Then when i comment this line. It's okay i can deploy my functions. However
there is no possibility to use next.js . So this is the problem.
I have this error even without using any nextjs stuff in my functions. Just
the fact to declare the line
`const app = next({ dev : false })` prevent my app to deploy
any suggestions ?
