User: There is an existing Nginx reverse proxy server, and you need to optimize its performance. Please provide a detailed optimization plan.
Assistant: The performance optimization plan of Nginx is as follows: 1. Compilation optimization When compiling Nginx, use an efficient compiler such as GCC to compile, and enable optimization modules such as PCRE, zlib, and SSL. At the same time, in order to save memory, unnecessary modules need to be cut out. 2. Network optimization In order to improve network performance, Nginx needs to perform the following optimizations: - Increase the file descriptor limit: Adjust the file descriptor limit of Linux to allow Nginx to process more connection requests at the same time. - Enable TCP_NODELAY: Use the TCP_NODELAY option to optimize the latency of TCP connections. - Adjust the TCP backlog parameter: increasing the value of this parameter can improve the processing speed of the connection. 3. Load balancing optimization The performance of Nginx load balancing can be optimized in the following ways: - Adjust the load balancing algorithm: choose a load balancing algorithm suitable for your business, such as using the hash algorithm to reduce the number of repeated caches and improve performance. - Multi-level load balancing: Dividing load balancing into multiple layers can improve the performance of the entire system by reducing the load of a single layer. - Concurrent connection optimization: By using technologies such as keepalive, clients can reuse connections and reduce connection establishment overhead. 4. Cache optimization The performance of the Nginx cache can be optimized in the following ways: - Adjust the cache time: Setting the cache time properly can reduce the number of cache hit failures. - Choose the appropriate caching strategy: use the caching strategy (such as LRU, FIFO, etc.) that suits your business, and you can run with the best efficiency. - Multi-level cache: Dividing the cache into multiple layers can reduce the burden on a single level and improve the performance of the entire system. 5. Static resource optimization The performance of Nginx static resources can be optimized in the following ways: - Compressed files: compress some large static files with gzip or brotli, which can greatly reduce the transmission speed. - Enable caching: Enable caching for some static resources to reduce request processing time. - Enable sendfile: Use sendfile to directly send static files to the client, which can reduce the time for data copying. In short, the above is a detailed plan for performance optimization of Nginx. You need to modify and innovate according to your own business scenarios.
