User: I have always used a mac to write and run python scripts. However, I have a bunch of files on a PC that I need to run a script on. I have never really used a PC and don't know how to run the script. 
If I go to the command program on the PC and type in python, nothing happens. How do I find where the python path is in order to get into the python prompt? Also, once I am in the prompt, is the importing of modules the same as in a Unix system?
Assistant: Assuming Python is installed, it is usually placed in a folder prefixed with "Python" and the major/minor version. E.g. C:\Python26
