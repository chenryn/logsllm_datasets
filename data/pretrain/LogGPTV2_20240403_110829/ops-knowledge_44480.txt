User: We're looking into transport/protocol solutions and were about to do various performance tests, so I thought I'd check with the community if they've already done this:
Has anyone done server performance tests for simple echo services as well as serialization/deserialization for various messages sizes comparing EJB3, Thrift, and Protocol Buffers on Linux?
Primarily languages will be Java, C/C++, Python, and PHP.
Update: I'm still very interested in this, if anyone has done any further benchmarks please let me know. Also, very interesting benchmark showing compressed JSON performing similar / better than Thrift / Protocol Buffers, so I'm throwing JSON into this question as well.
Assistant: If the raw net performance is the target, then nothing beats IIOP (see RMI/IIOP).
Smallest possible footprint -- only binary data, no markup at all. Serialization/deserialization is very fast too.
Since it's IIOP (that is CORBA), almost all languages have bindings.
But I presume the performance is not the only requirement, right?
