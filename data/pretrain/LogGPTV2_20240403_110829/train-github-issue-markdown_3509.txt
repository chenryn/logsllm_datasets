### Background
- **PR #7827**: Added a command to the Dockerfile to install `gevent`.
- **PR #7744**: Created a new requirements file to install additional dependencies, including `gevent`.

### Expected Outcome
To maintain consistency and avoid redundancy, we should adopt the approach outlined in **PR #7744**. This involves using the new requirements file for managing extra dependencies, such as `gevent`.

### Action Items
- Merge **PR #7744**.
- Remove the redundant installation command from the Dockerfile introduced in **PR #7827**.

This strategy will ensure a more organized and maintainable way of managing dependencies.
