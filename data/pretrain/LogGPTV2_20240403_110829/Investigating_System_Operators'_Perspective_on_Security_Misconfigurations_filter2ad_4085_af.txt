### Survey on System Operators' Perspective on Security Misconfigurations

#### Introduction
This survey aims to gather insights from system operators regarding their experiences with security misconfigurations, their level of expertise in operating various systems, and the impact of these misconfigurations on their work. Your responses will help us understand the challenges and potential solutions for improving system security.

### 7. Personal Experiences with Misconfigurations

**Introduction:**
We focus on deficient configurations that affect the security of a system. When answering these questions, please consider whether CONFIDENTIALITY, INTEGRITY, or AVAILABILITY may have been compromised or actually were compromised (and thus led to a security incident).

**Questions:**
(1) Have you ever misconfigured something that was relevant for the security of a system? (Regardless of whether there were consequences)

- Yes
- Not that I’m aware of
- No, never

(2) Have you misconfigured something that eventually led to a security incident? (Security incidents might include: unauthorized access attempts, service disruptions, unauthorized data processing, changes to system hardware, firmware, or software, etc.)

- Yes
- Not that I’m aware of
- No

(3) Have you ever encountered a security misconfiguration made by someone else?

- Yes
- Not that I’m aware of
- No

(4) Which of these common security misconfigurations did you make yourself and/or encounter done by someone else? Please ensure that the misconfigurations that come to mind were actually security-related.

- Bad or publicly known passwords
- Faulty or missing authentication
- Faulty assignment of permissions
- Delayed or missing updates
- Faulty firewall configuration
- Faulty scripting
- Faulty storage configuration (e.g., no safe backups)
- Missing encryption
- Faulty or no hardening (e.g., unneeded ports left open)
- Deployment of revealing information (e.g., extended logfiles)
- Inconsistent system integration
- Misused or improperly shared system (e.g., test/productive, internal/external)

(5) What other security misconfigurations did you make or encounter? Did we miss something?

(6) How did you come across those security misconfigurations you encountered? Did you stumble upon them while working? Were they discovered while troubleshooting a security incident? Did you spot a ticket/issue?

(7) How many of the security misconfigurations that led to a security incident were known beforehand?

- None of them
- Few of them
- Half of them
- Most of them
- All of them
- I’m not sure / Does not apply

- Blunder, mishap, oblivion
- Usage of poor (online) resources
- Fear of asking for help
- Having other priorities
- Lack of concern
- Insufficient or no quality assurance (testing, scanning)

(2) Environmental Reasons:

- Sole responsibility/no review (e.g., peer review)

### 10. Reactions to Misconfigurations

**Question:**
