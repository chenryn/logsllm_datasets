Your Experiences
We focus on deficient configurations that affect the security of a system.
Hence, when answering these questions concerning misconfigurations,
please check whether CONFIDENTIALITY, INTEGRITY or AVAILABIL-
ITY may have gotten compromised or actually were compromised (and
therewith led to a security incident).
(1) Have you misconfigured something that was relevant for
the security of a system? Regardless of whether there were con-
sequences–Haveyouevermisconfiguredsomethingthataffected

security?
# Not that I’m aware of.
# NO. Never.
(2) Have you misconfigured something that eventually led to
a security incident? Security incidents might be: Attempts from
unauthorized sources to access systems or data/ unplanned dis-
ruption to a service or denial of a service/ unauthorized process-
ing or storage of data/ unauthorized changes to system hardware,

(5) Whatothersecuritymisconfigurationsdidyoumakeorencounter?
Did we miss something?
(6) How did you come across those security misconfigurations you
encountered? Did you stumble upon them while working? Were
they discovered while troubleshooting a security incident? Did
you spot a ticket/issue?
(7) How many of the security misconfigurations that led to a security
incident were known beforehand?
Out of all the security incidents caused by misconfigurations, in
how many cases was the misconfiguration already recognized be-
# None of them.
fore the incident happened?
# Few of them.
# Half of them.
# Most of them.
# All of them.
# I’m not sure. / Does not apply.
