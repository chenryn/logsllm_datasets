# Bug report
## Describe the bug
The with-ant-design-less example is lack off hot reloading and client-side
rendering for css
## To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior, please provide code snippets or a repository:
Hot reloading problem:
  1. Go to 'asserts/antd-custom.less'
  2. Change the primary color
  3. Save
  4. The new primary color is not applied via hot reloading
Client-side rendering for css:
  1. Create a new page called "test.js" and less file called "test.less" then define simple css in it (e.g p {color: red})
  2. Import style "test.less" file into "test.js" and define a paragrah tag for testing
  3. Create a Link component inside index page to navigate to test page
  4. When navigating from index.js to test.js, although the test.less is merged into style.css file in /_next/static/style.css, the paragraph tag was not applied red color . If I refresh the test page, everything works fine
## Expected behavior
I really appreciate if anyone can tell me the appropriate way to use Ant
design in Next.js with custom less style with hot reloading, client-side
rendering by answering the questions below:
  1. What should I use to create an Ant Design Layout for all pages (the new implementation _app.js or _document.js?). I've tried to use this example (using _document.js and add ant design style into `style` tag), but the ant design icon part not working.
  2. I want to import .less style for each page, e.g pageA has pageA.less ,page B has pageB.less, how can I do that ?
## System information
