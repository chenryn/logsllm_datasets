ABSTRACT
We propose a proximity-based access control scheme for implantable
medical devices (IMDs). Our scheme is based on ultrasonic distance-
bounding and enables an implanted medical device to grant access
to its resources only to those devices that are in its close proxim-
ity. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach through tests
in an emulated patient environment. We show that, although im-
planted, IMDs can successfully verify the proximity of other de-
vices with high accuracy. We propose a set of protocols that support
our scheme, analyze their security in detail and discuss possible ex-
tensions. We make new observations about the security of imple-
mentations of ultrasonic distance-bounding protocols. Finally, we
discuss the integration of our scheme with existing IMD devices
and with their existing security measures.

INTRODUCTION
In order to facilitate communication and data readout, new gen-
erations of Implantable Medical Devices (IMDs), such as pacemak-
ers, are equipped with radio transceivers. Such interfaces makes it
convenient for medical professionals to get access to the data they
need but they also introduce some unique security and privacy chal-
lenges, access to personal data and the unauthorized modiﬁcation
of IMD parameters being the most prominent [11, 17, 9, 12].

In order to prevent unauthorized access to IMDs, conventional
solutions, based on public-key cryptography or on preloaded secret
keys cannot be directly applied since they typically also prevent ac-
cess to IMDs in emergency scenarios where the IMD needs to be
accessible to emergency ambulance staff [10]. IMDs therefore cre-
ate a tension between access control, i.e., patient privacy, and pa-
tient safety. Several solutions were proposed to address this prob-
lem. Some solutions are based on external devices such as access
tokens and communication cloakers [22, 6], whereas others rely on
close-range communication channels (e.g., RFID) [15]. In addition
to possibly being stolen, lost, or simply forgotten by the patient,
external devices also serve as a constant reminder to the patient of
her/his condition. Access control solutions based on close-range
communication have the advantage of being simple and intuitive,
but do not provide any ﬁrm guarantees about the range of com-
munication. Namely, an attacker with a strong enough transmitter
and a high-gain antenna will still be able to communicate with the
IMD even from far outside the intended range (for RFID-based so-
lutions from up to ten meters away [8]). Currently deployed solu-
tions based on magnetic switches are equally based on close-range
communication; in addition they do not require any form of au-
thentication to unlock access to the device and are thus inherently
insecure (incidents were reported when pacemakers were unlocked
by a magnetic ﬁeld from a patient’s headphones [7]).
In this work, we propose a new access control mechanism for
implantable medical devices. This mechanism is based on ultra-
sonic distance-bounding and enables an implanted medical device
to grant access to its resources only to those devices that are in its
close proximity. Our solution resembles close-range communica-
tion solutions proposed in prior work in that it requires a device to
be close to the IMD to get access, but differs in that it prevents the
attacker from accessing the IMD from further away, regardless of
the type of transceiver or antenna he has. Its security relies on the
speed of the sound which can not be altered. Moreover, unlike prior
proposals, our solution enables IMDs to predeﬁne an exact range
from which they can be accessed (with a high degree of accuracy).
We achieve this with a new proximity-based device pairing protocol
based on ultrasonic distance bounding. In this protocol, messages
are cryptographically tied to the distance bounds measured by the
IMD, to the device that requests access. We analyze the security
of our protocol in detail and discuss possible extensions related to
efﬁciency and DoS protection.
We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach through exper-
iments in an emulated patient environment. We show that, al-
though implanted, IMDs can successfully verify the proximity of
other devices. We further make new observations about the se-
curity of implementations of ultrasonic distance-bounding proto-
cols. We show that without appropriate shielding of their ultrasonic
410circuitry, implementations of these protocols are vulnerable to at-
tacks resulting from induced current in the audio receiver circuitry.
We further show that given that our solution relies on ultrasonic
distance-bounding, it can be implemented at low cost on existing
IMD platforms (note that some pacemakers already come equipped
with speakers).
Finally, we discuss the integration of our scheme with other so-
lutions proposed for access to IMDs. We show that our solution can
be easily combined with solutions based on security credentials or
tokens as well as with solutions that aim to prevent battery draining
Denial-of-Service attacks on IMDs (e.g., [21, 9]). It also naturally
integrates with solutions based on sonic user alerts [11].
We summarize our contributions in the following points:
1. We propose a new access control mechanism for implantable
medical devices that enables IMDs to predeﬁne an exact range
from which they can be accessed.
2. We demonstrate the feasibility of ultrasonic distance bound-
ing between implanted medical devices and external readers
using our prototype implementation.
3. We show that without appropriate shielding all devices using
ultrasonic distance bounding are vulnerable to compromise
by inducing signals in the ultrasonic circuitry.
4. We show that our solution can be easily combined with ex-
isting solutions and implemented on existing platforms.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we
give a detailed description of the problem, in Section 3 we present
our access control scheme based on a proximity aware device pair-
ing protocol. In Section 5 we provide the details of the implemen-
tation of our prototype, in Section 4 we describe extensions to the
main protocol and in Section 6 we cover related work. We conclude
the paper in Section 7.
2. SYSTEM AND ATTACKER MODEL
In this section, we present our system and attacker models.
2.1 System Model
In this paper we focus on access control, speciﬁcally in the con-
text of implantable medical devices. Access control in this context
means that a reader (potentially malicious) will try to gain access to
an implantable medical device in order to readout data or send com-
mands. The reader can be either a handheld unit or part of a bigger
system but the assumption is that it is not subject to tight power
and/or computational constraints. The medical device can be any
device implanted into the human body—including pacemakers, im-
plantable cardiac deﬁbrillators (ICDs), drug delivery systems, and
neurostimulators.
Implantable medical devices are used to help manage a broad
range of ailments such as cardiac arrhythmia, diabetes and Parkin-
son’s disease. They are implanted 2-3cm below the skin and elec-
trodes are then connected to whatever organ that needs monitoring,
e.g., the heart in the case of a pacemaker.
These devices do not have wired interfaces (e.g., a USB inter-
face), screens, keyboards or other peripherals that can be used to
enable access control; instead, these devices only rely on wireless
interfaces. The reason for having a radio interface in an IMD is
that a doctor or medical professional can interact with the device
quickly and easily. This is not only useful during normal consul-
tations with physicians but is also relevant in emergency scenar-
ios where emergency personnel (possibly in a different country)
need access to the patient’s IMD. That means that a device must
be accessible in the noisy and dynamic environment of a moving
ambulance and at the same time prevent unauthorized access to po-
tentially sensitive medical data.
We consider an IMD that can operate in two different modes. In
normal mode a reader needs to be in possession of a shared key in
order to talk to the IMD and in emergency mode a reader just needs
to be within a certain security range. In other words the emergency
mode relies on proximity alone to authorize a reader.
2.2 Attacker Model
We consider two different attack scenarios. In the ﬁrst scenario,
the attacker wants to get access to medical data stored in the im-
plantable device or change device settings [12]. The motivations
for this kind of attack can be anything from identity theft or black-
mail to simple curiosity or targeted advertising.
In the second attack scenario we consider an attacker that does
not care about establishing a connection with the implantable med-
ical device but instead wants to impersonate a device and make a
reader talk to him. This attack might be executed by someone who
wants to prevent care in an emergency situation or it could be per-
formed by the patient himself for the purpose of insurance fraud.
We place almost no restrictions on the attacker in terms of com-
munication, i.e., he can send and receive arbitrary radio and audio
signals. We do assume that the attacker is subject to common com-
putational bounds, i.e., he is not able to reverse one-way functions
or solve the discrete logarithm problem. We also assume that the
attacker is outside the security range deﬁned in the IMD (typically
<10cm). If the malicious reader is inside the security range and the
IMD is in emergency mode, the reader has free access by design.
The size of the security range is discussed in Section 4.
Because the implantable medical devices run on batteries they
are naturally energy constrained. That makes energy draining and
DoS attacks a danger to IMDs. Our protocols are designed with
energy conservation in mind, however, such attacks are not speciﬁ-
cally addressed in this paper. We focus on attacks on the key agree-
ment and proximity features of our protocol but it is worth noting
that our scheme nicely integrates with existing solutions to protect
against DoS/Energy draining attacks [21]. Some of these solutions
are discussed in related work in Section 6. We also do not specif-
ically address attacks on patient privacy in which the attacker tries
to check if the patient is wearing a pacemaker [9].
3. PROXIMITY-BASED ACCESS CONTROL
FOR IMPLANTABLE MEDICAL DEVICES
In this section we will describe our proximity-based access con-
trol scheme for implantable medical devices.
In our scheme the
access control is based on device pairing. In order for a reader to
talk to an IMD it must ﬁrst run a device pairing protocol and gener-
ate a shared key. This shared key is then used to gain access to the
device, either to send it commands or to readout medical data.
The core of the scheme, namely the proximity aware device pair-
ing protocol between a hand held reader and an implanted medical
device will be presented in this section. Extensions to the protocol
are presented in Section 4. The protocol uses ultrasonic distance
bounding to determine the distance between the reader and the de-
vice. As is common practice, we will use the terminology prover
and veriﬁer to denote the two parties throughout the rest of the
paper. The prover is the reader that must prove its proximity in
order for data transfer to commence. The veriﬁer is the implanted
medical device that must verify the distance to the prover before
accepting the connection.

Figure 1: Device pairing protocol. If this protocol is success-
fully executed both parties know that the key contribution from
the other party came from within a distance determined by
t2 −t1 (t4 −t3 respectively). The prover and veriﬁer also shares
a secret key k.
3.1 Protocol Description
The device pairing protocol is shown in Figure 1. The prover
will ﬁrst pick a secret exponent p and a nonce Np and then com-
pute the public DH contribution gp. These computations are done
in advance so they will not interfere with the time-critical distance
bounding steps. A ’hello’ message is sent by the prover to initiate
the protocol. When the veriﬁer receives the ’hello’ message it will
pick a nonce Nv and begin the rapid bit exchange phase. The veri-
ﬁer will send a single bit of Nv to the prover and record the time of
transmission (t1) so the time-of-ﬂight can later be calculated. The
distance bounding phase must be done bit-by-bit to avoid distance
shortening attacks [2, 5].
The message containing the ﬁrst bit of Nv is received by the
reader at time t′
1 but given that the reply must be sent via the sound
channel and that the speed of sound is relatively slow compared
to the propagation speed of the radio message and the delay at the
prover, we consider t1 = t′
1 . The error resulting from this
assumption is negligible as long as the prover replies immediately.
This will be described in more detail in Section 3.4.
