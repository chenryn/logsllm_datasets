User: Is there any way to zoom in on the Python Shell in Wing IDE? I am having trouble seeing the font because it is too small.
Assistant: For Wing IDE:
Try ctrl++ or ctrl+MouseScrollUp for quick changes. You can also just change your font size in the Editor preferences.
For Python IDLE:
Under Options --> Configure IDLE; change the Size.
For 'cmd' prompt or Bash:
Right-Click on the Window bar and select Properties. Change the font size in the 'Font' tab. If you want it to be permanent, do the same in 'Defaults' instead (from the right-click menu).
