**Abstract**

In environments where systems are under constant attack, the manual restoration of malware-infected systems is impractical. The VICI (Virtual-machine Introspection for Cognitive Immunity) Agent addresses this by automating the repair of kernel-modifying rootkit infections. Using Virtual Machine Introspection (VMI), the VICI Agent detects and repairs infected kernels in milliseconds. It selects the most appropriate repair technique based on the current situation, past experiences, and the potential cost of each technique. The VICI Agent operates autonomously, using a form of automated reasoning inspired by robotics. Tests have shown that the VICI Agent effectively repairs common kernel-modifying rootkits, with a minor performance impact of approximately 5% on the monitored virtual machine.

**1. Introduction**

Modern Internet-facing systems are frequently targeted by sophisticated adversaries. Once these adversaries gain administrative control, they often deploy kernel-modifying rootkits to conceal their presence and maintain control over extended periods. Traditional user-mode intrusion detection systems are ineffective against such rootkits because they rely on the integrity of the kernel. Recent research, such as XenKIMONO, VMwatcher, and Lycosid, has explored VMI to detect kernel-modifying rootkits. However, detection alone is insufficient; automated repair techniques are necessary to restore infected kernels to a healthy state within milliseconds. 

The VICI Agent is the first introspection-based system to offer fully automated repair functionality. It periodically examines the kernel's state using diagnostic functions and applies the most suitable repair action to restore proper kernel behavior. The VICI Agent uses a subsumption architecture from robotics to reason about the trade-offs between repair effectiveness and cost. Our experiments show that the VICI Agent can effectively counter well-known rootkits like Adore-ng, Override, and SuKIT, with a minimal performance overhead of around 5%.

**2. Kernel-Modifying Rootkits**

Kernel-modifying rootkits alter the behavior of the kernel, causing it to hide the adversary's presence from authorized users. These rootkits intercept and modify system call results, filter out adversary-related objects, and provide additional malicious functionalities like backdoors or keyloggers. Figure 1 illustrates some common methods used by rootkits to modify kernel behavior, including altering function pointers, modifying kernel text, and tampering with registers and memory.

**3. Architecture and Assumptions**

The VICI Agent runs on the Xen hypervisor's Domain 0, isolated from the virtual machine it protects. It uses Xen's hypercalls to pause the virtual machine, examine its state, and apply repairs. The agent performs a loop of scans, running diagnostics to detect rootkit modifications and applying repairs if necessary. If the previous scan's repairs fail, the VICI Agent escalates to more costly repair actions. The agent focuses on kernel-modifying rootkits but can be used in conjunction with user-mode malware detection programs for enhanced security.

**4. Diagnosis and Repair**

The VICI Agent uses VMI to run diagnostics on the virtual machine's kernel. It computes MD5 checksums of kernel and module text, compares important function pointers, registers, and constants, and detects unapproved packet handlers and tampered pseudo-random number generators. The agent has a set of repair actions, starting with the least costly "Surgical" repair, which corrects common rootkit modifications. More complex rootkits may require the "Core War" repair, which involves more aggressive and costly measures.

**5. Automated Reasoning and Subsumption Architecture**

The VICI Agent employs a subsumption architecture to make autonomous decisions about which repair action to use. This architecture allows the agent to start with the least expensive repair and escalate to more costly actions if needed. The agent also de-escalates to cheaper repairs if the infection complexity decreases. This approach ensures that the agent can adapt to different rootkit behaviors and minimize the overall cost of repairs.

**6. Related Work**

Several projects, such as XenKIMONO, VMwatcher, and Lycosid, have explored VMI for rootkit detection. However, the VICI Agent is unique in its ability to follow detection with fully automated and rapid repair. These related works provide valuable insights into the challenges and potential solutions in the field of VMI and rootkit detection.

**7. Performance Impact**

Our benchmarks indicate that the VICI Agent reduces application performance on the monitored virtual machine by slightly more than 5% when configured to run diagnostics every 50 milliseconds. This performance overhead is a small price to pay for the robust and automated protection provided by the VICI Agent.

**8. Limitations and Future Work**

While the VICI Agent is effective against many common rootkits, it does not cover all possible kernel modifications. Future work could include expanding the diagnostic and repair capabilities, hardening the Xen hypervisor and Domain 0, and developing more advanced automated reasoning techniques. Additionally, integrating the VICI Agent with other security tools could further enhance its effectiveness.

**9. Conclusions**

The VICI Agent is a pioneering solution for the automated detection and repair of kernel-modifying rootkits. By leveraging VMI and a subsumption architecture, it provides a fast, effective, and autonomous means of restoring infected kernels to a healthy state. The minor performance impact and the ability to adapt to different rootkit behaviors make the VICI Agent a valuable tool in the fight against persistent and sophisticated cyber threats.
