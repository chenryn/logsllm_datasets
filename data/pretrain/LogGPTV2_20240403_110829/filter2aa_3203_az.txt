DHCP clients running Windows Server 2003 or Windows XP use the Microsoft Windows 2000 Options 
vendor class, which the DHCP Server service adds by default. In most cases, the default vendor 
class—DHCP Standard Options—provides a way to group any Windows-based DHCP clients or other 
DHCP clients that do not specify a vendor class ID. In some cases, you might define additional vendor 
classes for other DHCP clients, such as printers or some types of UNIX clients. When you add other 
vendor classes for these purposes, the vendor class identifier that you use when you configure the 
class at the server should match the identifier that the DHCP clients use. 
User Classes 
User classes allow DHCP clients to differentiate themselves by specifying what types of clients they 
are, such as a remote access client computer or desktop computer. For DHCP clients running Windows 
Vista, Windows XP, Windows Server 2008, or Windows Server 2003, you can define specific user class 
identifiers to convey information about a client's software configuration, its physical location in a 
building, or its user preferences. For example, an identifier can specify that DHCP clients are members 
of a user-defined class called "2nd floor, West," which needs a special set of router, DNS, and WINS 
server settings. An administrator can then configure the DHCP server to assign different option types 
depending on the type of client receiving the lease.

You can use user classes in the following ways: 
DHCP client computers can identify themselves as part of a specific user class by including DHCP user 
class options when sending DHCP request messages to the DHCP server.  
DHCP servers running Windows Server 2008 or Windows Server 2003 and the DHCP Server service 
can recognize and interpret the DHCP user class options from clients and provide additional options (or 
a modified set of DHCP options) based on the client's user class identity.  
For example, shorter leases should be assigned to remote access clients who connect to the network 
over phone lines or the Internet. Different desktop clients on the same subnet might require special 
settings, such as WINS and DNS server settings. 
If the client specifies no user-defined option classes, the server assigns that client default settings (such 
as server options or scope options). 
You add vendor or user classes by right-clicking either the IPv4 node or the DHCP server name in the 
DHCP snap-in and then clicking either Define Vendor Classes or Define User Classes. After you 
have added the classes, you configure user and vendor class options on the Advanced tab of the 
properties of a scope option. Figure 6-14 shows an example.

class ID on computers running Windows.

The DHCP Relay Agent 
The Routing and Remote Access service in Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2003 includes 
the DHCP Relay Agent, a routing protocol component that can act as an RFC 1542-compliant DHCP 
relay agent (also known as a BOOTP relay agent). 
Installing the DHCP Relay Agent 
Depending on your choices in the Routing and Remote Access Server Setup Wizard, you might have 
already installed the DHCP Relay Agent routing protocol component. If you must install and enable the 
DHCP Relay Agent, do the following: 
1. In the console tree of the Routing and Remote Access snap-in, double-click the server name. 
2. For Windows Server 2008, open IPv4, right-click General, and then click New Routing Protocol. 
3. For Windows Server 2003, open IP Routing, right-click General, and then click New Routing 
Protocol.  
4. In the New Routing Protocol dialog box, click DHCP Relay Agent, and then click OK. 
5. In the console tree, right-click DHCP Relay Agent, and then click Properties. 
6. In the DHCP Relay Agent Properties dialog box, add the list of IPv4 addresses that correspond to 
the DHCP servers on your network to which this computer will forward DHCPDiscover, 
DHCPRequest, DHCPDecline, and DHCPInform messages.  
Figure 6-15 shows an example of the DHCP Relay Agent Properties dialog box. 
Figure 6-15  An example of the DHCP Relay Agent Properties dialog box 
After you have installed the DHCP Relay Agent and configured the list of DHCP servers, you must 
enable the DHCP Relay Agent on the appropriate interfaces. To enable the DHCP Relay Agent on an 
additional interface, do the following: 
1. In the console tree of the Routing and Remote Access snap-in, double-click the server name. 
Chapter 6 – Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol 
TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows  
Page: 186 
2. For Windows Server 2008, open IPv4, right-click DHCP Relay Agent, and then click New Interface. 
3. For Windows Server 2003, open IP Routing, right-click DHCP Relay Agent, and then click New 
Interface.  
4. Click the interface that you want to add, and then click OK.  
5. In the DHCP Relay Properties dialog box, on the General tab, verify that the Relay DHCP packets 
check box is selected.  
6. If needed, in Hop-count threshold and Boot threshold (seconds), click the arrows to modify the 
thresholds as needed.  
7. Click OK. 
Figure 6-16 shows an example of the DHCP Relay Properties dialog box for an interface. 
Figure 6-16  An example of the DHCP Relay Properties dialog box for an interface 
The Hop count threshold field is the maximum number of DHCP relay agents that can forward a 
DHCP message before this DHCP relay agent receives it. When a DHCP relay agent receives a 
DHCPDiscover, DHCPRequest, or DHCPDecline message, it checks the value of the Hops field in the 
DHCP header of the message. If the value in the Hops field exceeds the value in the hop count 
threshold, the DHCP relay agent silently discards the message. If not, the DHCP relay agent 
increments the value of the Hops field before forwarding the message. 
The Boot threshold (seconds) field is the amount of time that the DHCP relay agent waits before it 
forwards broadcast DHCP request messages. This option is useful when you want a DHCP server on 
the same subnet as the DHCP client to respond first. If the local DHCP server does not respond, you 
want the DHCP relay agent to forward the messages to a remote DHCP server.

Address Autoconfiguration for IPv6 
A highly useful feature of IPv6 is its ability to perform address autoconfiguration (specified in RFC 
4862). Using address autoconfiguration, an IPv6 host can automatically configure itself without using an 
address configuration protocol, such as Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6). By 
default, an IPv6 host can configure a link-local address for each interface. By using router discovery, a 
host can also determine the addresses of routers, additional addresses, and other configuration 
parameters. The addresses configured using router discovery are known as stateless addresses. For 
stateless addresses, the router does not record which IPv6 hosts are using which addresses. The 
Router Advertisement message indicates whether an address configuration protocol should be used. 
Autoconfigured Address States 
Autoconfigured addresses are in one or more of the following states: 
Tentative  
The address is in the process of being verified as unique. Verification occurs through duplicate 
address detection. 
Valid  
An address from which unicast traffic can be sent and received. The valid state covers both the 
preferred and deprecated states. The Router Advertisement message includes the amount of time 
that an address remains in the valid state. The valid lifetime must be greater than or equal to the 
preferred lifetime. 
Preferred  
An address for which uniqueness has been verified. A node can send and receive unicast 
traffic to and from a preferred address. The Router Advertisement message includes the period 
of time that an address can remain in the tentative and preferred states. 
Deprecated  
An address that is still valid but whose use is discouraged for new communication. Existing 
communication sessions can continue to use a deprecated address. A node can send and 
receive unicast traffic to and from a deprecated address. 
Invalid  
An address for which a node can no longer send or receive unicast traffic. An address enters the 
invalid state when the valid lifetime expires. 
Figure 6-17 shows the relationship between the states of an autoconfigured address and the preferred 
and valid lifetimes.

Figure 6-17  States of an autoconfigured IPv6 address 
With the exception of link-local addresses, address autoconfiguration is specified only for hosts. You 
must manually configure addresses and other parameters on routers.  
Types of Autoconfiguration 
There are three types of autoconfiguration: 
Stateless  
Address configuration is based on the receipt of Router Advertisement messages. These messages 
include stateless address prefixes and require hosts not to use a stateful address configuration 
protocol. 
Stateful  
Configuration is based on the use of an address configuration protocol, such as DHCPv6, to obtain 
addresses and other configuration options. A host uses stateful address configuration when it 
receives Router Advertisement messages that do not include address prefixes and that require 
hosts to use an address configuration protocol. A host can also use an address configuration 
protocol when no routers are present on the local link. 
Both  
Configuration is based on receipt of Router Advertisement messages. These messages include 
stateless address prefixes and require hosts to use a address configuration protocol. 
For all autoconfiguration types, a link-local address is always configured.  
Autoconfiguration Process 
The address autoconfiguration process for an IPv6 node occurs as follows: 
1. A tentative link-local address is derived from the link-local prefix of FE80::/64 and the 64-bit interface 
identifier.  
2. Duplicate address detection is performed to verify the uniqueness of the tentative link-local address.  
If duplicate address detection fails, you must configure the node manually.  
If duplicate address detection succeeds, the tentative link-local address is assumed to be unique and 
valid. The link-local address is initialized for the interface.  
For an IPv6 host, address autoconfiguration continues as follows: 
1. The host sends a Router Solicitation message.  
Chapter 6 – Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol 
TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows  
Page: 189 
2. If the host receives no Router Advertisement messages, it can use an address configuration protocol 
to obtain addresses and other configuration parameters.  
3. If the host receives a Router Advertisement message, the host is configured with the configuration 
information that the message includes.  
4. For each stateless address prefix that is included:  
The address prefix and the appropriate 64-bit interface identifier are used to derive a tentative 
address.  
Duplicate address detection verifies the uniqueness of the tentative address.  
If the tentative address is in use, the address is not initialized for the interface.  
If the tentative address is not in use, the address is initialized. This initialization includes setting the 
valid and preferred lifetimes based on information in the Router Advertisement message.  
5. If specified in the Router Advertisement message, the host uses a stateful address configuration 
protocol to obtain additional addresses or configuration parameters. 
DHCPv6 
DHCPv6 can provide stateful address configuration or stateless configuration settings to IPv6 hosts. 
With stateful address autoconfiguration, hosts can use DHCPv6 to configure non-link-local addresses. 
An IPv6 host performs stateless address autoconfiguration automatically based on the following flags in 
the Router Advertisement message sent by a neighboring router: 
Managed Address Configuration Flag, which is also known as the M flag. When set to 1, this flag 
instructs the host to use DHCPv6 to obtain stateful addresses. 
Other Stateful Configuration Flag , which is also known as the O flag. When set to 1, this flag instructs 
the host to use DHCPv6 to obtain other configuration settings. 
When both M and O Flags are set to 0, hosts use only router advertisements for non-link-local 
addresses and other methods (such as manual configuration) to configure other settings. When both M 
and O Flags are set to 1, the host uses DHCPv6 for both addresses and other configuration settings. 
This combination is known as DHCPv6 stateful: DHCPv6 is assigning stateful addresses to IPv6 hosts. 
When the M Flag is set to 0 and the O Flag is set to 1, the host uses DHCPv6 to obtain other 
configuration settings. Neighboring routers are configured to advertise non-link-local address prefixes 
from which IPv6 hosts derive stateless addresses. This combination is known as DHCPv6 stateless: 
DHCPv6 is not assigning stateful addresses to IPv6 hosts, but stateless configuration settings. When 
the M Flag is set to 1 and the O Flag is set to 0, hosts use DHCPv6 for address configuration but not for 
other settings. Because IPv6 hosts typically need to be configured with other settings, such as the IPv6 
addresses of DNS servers, this is an unlikely combination. 
Like DHCP for IPv4, the components of a DHCPv6 infrastructure consist of DHCPv6 clients that 
request configuration, DHCPv6 servers that provide configuration, and DHCPv6 relay agents that 
convey messages between clients and servers when clients are located on subnets that do not have a 
DHCPv6 server.

DHCPv6 Messages and Message Exchanges 
As with DHCP for IPv4, DHCPv6 uses User Datagram Protocol (UDP) messages. DHCPv6 clients 
listen for DHCP messages on UDP port 546. DHCPv6 servers and relay agents listen for DHCPv6 
messages on UDP port 547.  
There are no broadcast addresses defined for IPv6. Therefore, the use of the limited broadcast address 
for some DHCPv4 messages has been replaced with the use of the 
All_DHCP_Relay_Agents_and_Servers multicast address of FF02::1:2 for DHCPv6. For example, a 
DHCPv6 client attempting to discover the location of the DHCPv6 server on the network sends a Solicit 
message from its link-local address to FF02::1:2. If there is a DHCPv6 server on the host's subnet, it 
receives the Solicit message and sends an appropriate reply. More typically, a DHCPv6 relay agent on 
the host's subnet receives the Solicit message and forwards it to a DHCPv6 server. 
Table 6-2 lists the DHCPv6 messages.
