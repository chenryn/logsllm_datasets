### Windows Installation and Recovery Tools

#### System Image Recovery
Previously known as Complete PC Restore or Automated System Recovery (ASR) in earlier versions of Windows, this tool restores a Windows installation from a complete backup. Unlike a system restore point, which may not contain all damaged files and lost data, a full system image ensures a comprehensive recovery.

#### Startup Repair
This is an automated tool designed to detect and fix the most common Windows startup issues. It automatically attempts to resolve problems without requiring manual intervention.

#### PC Reset
PC Reset is a tool that removes all non-standard applications and drivers, resets all settings to their default, and restores Windows to its original state after installation. Users have the option to retain personal data or remove everything, in which case Windows will be reinstalled from scratch.

#### Command Prompt
For situations where troubleshooting or repair requires manual intervention, such as copying files from another drive or manipulating the Boot Configuration Data (BCD), the command prompt provides a full Windows shell. This allows you to launch almost any Windows program, provided the necessary dependencies are met. This is more powerful than the limited set of commands available in the Recovery Console of earlier Windows versions.

#### Windows Memory Diagnostic Tool
This tool performs memory diagnostic tests to check for signs of faulty RAM, which can cause random kernel and application crashes and erratic system behavior. The tool can be launched from a working system or from a Command Prompt opened in WinRE using the `mdsched.exe` executable.

### Accessing Recovery Tools

When booting from the Windows DVD or boot disks, the Windows Setup menu offers the choice to install or repair an existing installation. If you choose to repair, you will see a screen similar to the modern boot menu, providing different options for recovery tools. These include booting from another device, using a different OS (if registered in the BCD store), or selecting a recovery tool. All the described recovery tools (except for the Memory Diagnostic Tool) are located in the Troubleshoot section.

### Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE)

The Windows setup application installs WinRE to a recovery partition during a clean system installation. You can access WinRE by pressing the Shift key while rebooting through the Start menu's shutdown button. In systems using the Legacy Boot menu, WinRE can be started by pressing the F8 key to access advanced boot options during Bootmgr execution. If the system fails to boot due to damaged files, Bootmgr will automatically start WinRE at the next reboot cycle, launching the Startup Repair tool.

### Safe Mode

Safe mode is a boot configuration that loads only the minimal set of device drivers and services necessary for booting. This avoids loading third-party and non-essential drivers that might cause the system to crash.

#### Entering Safe Mode
1. **Boot in WinRE and select Startup Settings in the Advanced options.**
2. **In multi-boot environments, select "Change Defaults or Choose Other Options" in the modern boot menu and go to the Troubleshoot section to select the Startup Settings button.**
3. **If your system uses the Legacy Boot menu, press the F8 key to enter the Advanced Boot Options menu.**

#### Types of Safe Mode
- **Standard Safe Mode**: Loads the minimum number of device drivers and services.
- **Safe Mode with Networking**: Adds network drivers and services to the standard safe mode.
- **Safe Mode with Command Prompt**: Runs the Command Prompt application (Cmd.exe) instead of Windows Explorer as the shell.
- **Directory Services Restore Mode**: Boots the system with the Active Directory service offline, allowing for database repairs or restoration from backup media.

### Driver Loading in Safe Mode

Windows determines which device drivers and services to load in safe mode based on the `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SafeBoot` registry key. This key contains subkeys like `Minimal` and `Network`, which specify the names of device drivers or services to include. For example, the `ssply.sys` subkey identifies the Basic display driver, which provides basic graphics services for any PC-compatible display adapter.

### Safe-Mode-Aware User Programs

Components like the Service Control Manager (SCM) and Userinit check the `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SafeBoot\Option` registry key to determine if the system is booting in safe mode. Applications can also use the `GetSystemMetrics(SM_CLEANBOOT)` function to check if the system is in safe mode.

### Boot Status File

Windows uses a `bootstat.dat` file (located in `SystemRoot\Bootstat.dat`) to record the system's progress through various stages, including boot and shutdown. This file helps the Boot Manager, Windows loader, and Startup Repair tool detect abnormal shutdowns and offer appropriate recovery and diagnostic options.

### Conclusion

This chapter covered the detailed steps involved in starting and shutting down Windows, both normally and in error cases. We explored the core system mechanisms that ensure the system's smooth operation and discussed new security technologies designed to keep the system safe during early startup stages. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for effective system administration and troubleshooting.
