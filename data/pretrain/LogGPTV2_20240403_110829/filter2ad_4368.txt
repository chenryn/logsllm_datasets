Abstract   
This talk  will  discuss issues and methods 
for 
systems  under 
malicious  attacks.  To  protect  from  such 
attacks,  it  is  necessary  to  take  steps  to 
prevent  attacks  from  succeeding.  At  the 
same time, it is important to recognize that 
not all attacks can be averted at the outset; 
to  some 
attacks

unavoidable  and  comprehensive  support 
for identifying and responding to attacks is 
required.  
        In  my  talk,  I  will  describe  the  recent

use to penetrate computer networks. I will 
show  how  attack  graphs  can  be  used  to 
compute  actual 
sets  of  hardening 
measures  that  guarantee  the  safety  of 
given critical resources. Attack graphs can 
also  be  used  to  correlate  received  alerts, 
hypothesize  missing  alerts,  and  predict 
future  alerts,  all  at  the  same  time.  Thus, 
they  offer  a  promising  solution 
for 
administrators  to  monitor  and  predict  the
