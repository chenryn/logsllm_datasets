Hello,
I will try to summarize my problem in a simpler one. Suppose an H Hermitian
operator that depends on an α parameter  
H = H (α), ψ (x) are eigenfunctions of H, ψ = ψ (x, α). Consider the following
function  
![CodeCogsEqn](https://user-

where f(x) is a continuous function.
The LinearAlgebra.eigvecs function provides ψ correctly, except that the ψ
signal fluctuates randomly by + and -. Which is physically correct, because if
ψ is a eigenfunction of H, then -ψ is also a eigenfunction with the same
eigenvalue. So for some values of α, ψ is positive and for others negative,
this happens randomly. In the end, the function J(α) is full of
discontinuities. Is it possible to keep the ψ sign?
