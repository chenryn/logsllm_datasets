ABSTRACT
Text passwords play an important role in protecting the assets of
organisations. Thus, it is of the essence, that employees are well
aware of possible attacks and defences. To that end, we developed
a password security awareness-raising material in a systematic iter-
ative process: The material is based on the literature on password
security, feedback of independent experts, and feedback of lay-users.
It was evaluated in the eld with employees of three organisations.
Our results show that the participating employees improved their
abilities to (1) discern secure from insecure password-related be-
haviour in a variety of scenarios relating to dierent attacks and (2)
assess passwords as secure or insecure. These improved abilities of
the participants were still present in a retention after six months.
Thus, the developed awareness-raising material contributes to im-
proving the password-related security in organisations.

1 INTRODUCTION
Many users face problems when choosing, handling, or remem-
bering their passwords [16, 27, 28], leading to insecure password-
related behaviours. As a result, targeting passwords is the most
prevalent tactic for attacks on organisations: in 2016 [32], 63% of
breaches could be attributed to leveraging weak, default, or stolen
passwords. In 2017 [33], this number was found to have increased
to 81%.
Passwords can get into the hands of attackers in numerous ways,
e.g. they can be guessed, stolen in phishing attacks, eavesdropped
when communication occurs through unsecured channels, or stolen

when users are observed while entering them. Many users are not
aware how such attacks work and consequently how to defend
against them eectively [27, 31]. Those users are at risk of falling
victim to attacks, which in turn might lead to security breaches in
organisations. When an organisation is aected by a breach, this
can have severe nancial consequences: in 2017 the average total
cost of a data breach was found to be $3.62 million [25]. To prevent
such consequences, it is imperative that employees of organisations
understand the attacks targeting passwords and user accounts as
well as the corresponding defences. The prime way to achieve
this are information security awareness-raising materials [14, 35].
They are widely considered to be essential for the resilience of
organisations against information security threats [19, 20]. Yet,
many existing awareness-raising materials on password security
demand from users an impossible task: use only complex passwords,
change them frequently, and never write them down. This kind
of advice is highly problematic for users [16, 27, 28] and does not
represent the current state of the art [21, 37]: awareness-raising
materials must eectively enable users to apply the knowledge
contained within them to their daily lives or the time and eort
spent working through the materials is spent in vain [2].
As core contribution of this work, we address the problem of
making users aware of the dierent attacks on passwords and user
accounts as well as defences against these attacks. To that end, we
developed an awareness-raising material following an iterative pro-
cess. The initial development of the material was based on research
literature on password security (Section 3.1). It was then rened
incorporating feedback from independent information security ex-
perts from academia and industry (Section 3.2) as well as feedback
from lay-users (Section 3.3). The rened material was then evalu-
ated in the eld with employees of three organisations (Section 4).
The results of our evaluation (Section 5) show that the developed
material was not only received very positively and most partici-
pants found it very helpful, but it also contributes to the password-
related security in organisations in two ways. Firstly, it improved
the participating employees’ ability to assess password-related be-
haviour with respect to the attacks described in the material as
secure or insecure. Secondly, the participating employees improved
their ability to assess the security of passwords. In particular, the
results of our retention (Section 6) show that these improvements
remain even six months after the participants have read through
the material. From the discussion of our results, we derive some
further renements (Section 7). In summary, our awareness-raising
material contributes to improving the password security in organi-
sations. The awareness-raising material is freely available online1,
so that users and organisations can easily benet from it.

2 RELATED WORK
Information security awareness-raising materials [15] are an im-
portant tool in keeping users and organisations secure. Lin and
Kunnathur [20] developed a theory of end user information secu-
rity competence based a synthesis of information security liter-
ature. Their theory comprises three dimensions: “ethics and per-
ception”, “knowledge and skills”, and “behaviour”. They highlight
information security awareness as vital part of the knowledge and
skills dimension. This is further evidenced by the many studies (e.g.
[7, 10, 18, 23, 26]) having identied the importance of advice and
awareness-raising materials. Also, the literature review of Lebek et
al. [19] identies information security awareness as antecedent of
attitude toward secure behaviour. Thus, institutions such as NIST
[35] recommend organisations to distribute awareness-raising mate-
rials among their employees. Some industry standards even require
it from organisations aiming to be compliant with it [24]. However,
it has been found, that existing password advice often contradicts
current research [21, 37]. Zhang-Kennedy et al. [37] present a re-
view of established advice for general-purpose authentication on
the web. They conclude that many existing rules (e.g. to change
passwords frequently) do not represent the current state of art and
propose a new set of password rules to give as advice to users. Mur-
ray and Malone [21] present an analysis of actual password advice
given by dierent organisations on the Internet and conclude that
the majority of advice contradicts the current state of research.
Due to the importance of awareness-raising materials, research
literature has highlighted several important aspects of their devel-
opment. Bada and Sasse [2] analysed which aspects are involved in
the success and failure of security awareness campaigns. They iden-
tied as precedents to successful awareness materials the relevancy
of the materials for the users and that the advice in the materials
is actionable. Their recommendation is that all awareness-raising
materials should pay great attention to these aspects. Tsohou et al.
[30] add to these recommendations in their review of literature on
cognitive and cultural biases inuencing users information secu-
rity perceptions and behaviours. From the reviewed literature they
derive three recommendations for the development of awareness-
raising materials: (1) using positive stimuli and relative frequencies
to overcome aect biases, (2) the design of the material must ac-
commodate for the fact that users tend to rely on the rst piece
of information they are provided with, and (3) the material should
emphasise immediate consequences. Another important concept
for the development of awareness-raising materials is intellectual
need (also called problem-solution ordering) as described by Fuller
et al. [12]. It describes the fact that learners are more motivated and
eective at acquiring knowledge, when presented with the problem
before the solution is explained to them. Furthermore, using expert
feedback and behaviour has been identied as an important aspect
in the development of advice for lay-users. Ion et al. [17] compared
expert to non-expert information security behaviour to collect use-
ful information security advice for lay-users. Their study focused
on information security behaviour in general. They found that ex-
pert and non-expert behaviour dier and summarise their ndings
by saying that "some promising security advice emerges: (1) install
software updates, (2) use a password manager, and (3) use two-
factor authentication for online accounts." Likewise, Stobert and
Biddle [28] conducted interviews with information security experts
specically in the context of passwords and user accounts. They
nd that non-experts are in need of consistent strategies to better
protect themselves and that the adoption of password managers
could help non-experts to manage their passwords more securely.
Focusing on the creation of concrete password security awareness-
raising materials, Zhang-Kennedy et al. [36] developed three info-
graphic posters and an online educational comic. They evaluated
the posters against a text condition - “the Wikipedia description of
how password cracking works” - and found that the posters with
explanatory graphics were more eective in the knowledge transfer
than the textual Wikipedia description, underlining the importance
of graphical elements in awareness-raising materials.
3 DEVELOPMENT OF THE
AWARENESS-RAISING MATERIAL
The goal of this work is to create an awareness-raising material
describing possible attacks on passwords and user accounts as well
as eective defences against the attacks. For the development of
our awareness material we applied the recommendations of the
research literature outlined in the last section.
Awareness-raising materials exist in a variety of formats [29],
e.g. instructor-based, computer-based, and text-based. Each format
oers dierent advantages and disadvantages. In this work, we
focus on text-based awareness-raising materials. They allow self-
paced learning, where the employees can choose the time and
location of their convenience to engage in the awareness-raising
materials and they can easily accommodate for reasonable break-
points [22].
For the development of the awareness-raising material, we em-
ployed a process with three iterations. The initial iteration of the
awareness-raising material was based on the literature on pass-
word security and focused on the aggregation of relevant content.
This in particular addresses the detachment of password advice
and current research literature described by Murray and Malone
[21] as well as Zhang-Kennedy et al. [37]. The second iteration
incorporated feedback gathered from experts from academia and
industry. It focused on the correctness and completeness of the
material’s content. The third iteration added visual elements and
incorporated the informal feedback of lay-users. It focused on the
appeal and understandability of the material.
3.1 First Iteration - Based on Literature
The rst step in the development of the awareness-raising material
was the identication of relevant content. When preparing the
content for the awareness-raising material, we followed the rst
recommendation of Tsohou et al. [30], i.e. we used positive phrasing
and relative frequencies whenever possible. In addition, since our
awareness-raising material specically targets lay-users, we used
non-technical terms wherever possible.
We decided to add two introductory sections giving the users
a short overview of (1) who might attack them and where attacks
can be targeted at and (2) the possible consequences of successful
attacks. The latter is thereby intended to addresses the third recom-
mendation of Tsohou et al. [30]. However, we carefully balanced this
recommendation with the rst, focusing in our awareness-material
734
Systematic Creation Of Awareness-Raising Materials On Password Security
ACSAC ’18, December 3–7, 2018, San Juan, PR, USA
on the positive phrasing instead of risk and fear. Thereafter, the
description of the actual attacks and defences follow. Following
the recommendations of Bada and Sasse [2] we strongly focused
on relevant attacks on passwords and user accounts as well as ac-
tionable defences against them. The selection of attacks is based
on the detailed comparative analysis of a variety of authentication
schemes by Bonneau et al. [5]. In their analysis, they compare the
authentication schemes’ security based on eleven so-called security
benets and the corresponding attacks. In addition to the attacks
in [5], we considered the exploitation of reset-mechanisms. This
attack is highly relevant, since commonly used reset-mechanisms
such as “personal security questions” have been shown to oer low
security [4]. The defences are based on the literature on password
security and included in particular the recommendations identied
as important advice, e.g. by Ion et al. [17] to use password managers
and two-factor authentication (cf. section 2).
The attacks in the work of Bonneau et al. [5] do not follow a
systematic order. For our awareness-raising material, we ordered
them in "ascending distance from the user", i.e. rst attacks on the
users themselves, then on the users’ devices, then the communica-
tion between the devices and remote services, etc. The description
of each attack was divided into three parts: a description of the
attack, a description of the defences, and further hints. Thereby, we
address the second recommendation of Tsohou et al. [30] by giving
the most important information on each attack and defence strategy
rst. The dedicated further hints-section comes last and includes
only information that we anticipate to be relevant or interesting
for few users (e.g. hints for specic software).
The included types of attacks are: (a) Attacks targeted directly
at the users and their interaction with their devices, e.g. based on
fraudulent messages or shoulder surng; (b) attacks targeted at
the user’s device through malware; (c) attacks targeted at compro-
mising the communication between the users’ devices and remote
services; (d) attacks targeted at the devices and remote services
(e.g. servers of a website), i.e. insecurely store passwords on users’
devices and guessing attacks; and (e) attacks targeted at remote
services (e.g. servers of a website). Beside the aforementioned two
technologies, i.e. password managers and two-factor authentication,
the awareness-raising material included also descriptions of the
technologies: ngerprint readers, graphical passwords, hardware
tokens, privacy lters, and single-sign-on. For a detailed overview
of the awareness-raising material’s content, i.e. all included attacks
and technologies, see appendix A.
3.2 Second Iteration - Incorporation of
Structured Expert Feedback
To improve the initial version of the awareness-raising material,
we iterated its development based on a round of structured ex-
pert feedback. The goal of this second iteration was to ensure the
awareness-raising material’s completeness (i.e. aspects that would
be relevant to users in the organisational and the private context)
and correctness (i.e. no errors or unclear descriptions leading to
the perception of errors in the content) from an information secu-
rity point of view. For this purpose, we created a PDF-le of the
awareness-raising material with a dedicated feedback page inserted
after each of the two introductory sections as well as after the
descriptions of each attack. Each feedback page had two free text
questions asking (a) if the expert felt that any aspects would be
missing from the description of the attack, and (b) if the expert
thought that the description of the attack should be altered to be
clearer. We contacted 30 independent information security experts
from academia and from industry (researchers, information secu-
rity consultants, etc.) and sent them the awareness-raising material
with instructions to give feedback on each section. The experts
were contacted based on their expertise in the password security
domain and their expertise in the context of SMEs. Only German
native-speakers were contacted, since our awareness-raising mate-
rials were created in German. From the 30 experts we contacted,
13 sent us their feedback. We received responses from three re-
searchers, four IT security consultants, three IT administrators,
two people working in the IT security department of their compa-
nies, and one person working in a company testing and developing
security solutions. Thus, we received feedback from a diverse set
of experts. In the following, we outline the major improvements to
the awareness-raising material derived from the feedback.
3.2.1 More detailed information about possible consequences.
Due to the focus on positive phrasing, the the rst iteration of the
awareness-raising material comprised only relatively few, but broad
examples of possible consequences. All experts noted that more
concrete examples would be benecial. Therefore, we adjusted the
focus on positive phrasing based on the structured expert feedback
and expanded the respective introductory section with concrete
examples of consequences of breaches for dierent attacks and
types of user accounts (e.g. banking, email, social networks, etc.).
Also, we used the expert feedback to improve the phrasing of the
consequences to target more specically employees of SMEs.
3.2.2
Split of the aacks on network communication. The ma-
jority of experts felt that the section on attacking the network
communication would benet from a split in two sections: one
covering attacking unencrypted communication and one covering
attacking encrypted communication. Therefore, we split up the
section accordingly into one attack named "Eavesdropping on un-
encrypted communication" and one attack named "Eavesdropping
on encrypted communication". Note that for these two attacks the
wording was improved based on the expert feedback as well, re-
placing the term "compromising" with "eavesdropping" since it was
frequently mentioned the term might be better suited for lay-users.
3.2.3 The aspect of physical access in order to compromise de-
vices. Several experts noted that the description on how devices
can be compromised should not only focus on malware, but also
include physical access to the devices, e.g. accessing devices directly
or tampering with them, when employees are not in the vicinity
of their devices and the devices are therefore unattended. While
the awareness-raising material already instructed users to set a
password lock on their devices and lock the devices whenever they
leave them unattended, the experts felt further scenarios were of
importance (e.g. access to data on unencrypted hard drives by re-
moving the drives from an unattended device). Consequently, we
reworked the respective section to include these aspects.
