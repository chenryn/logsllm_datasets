## Abstract
Text-based passwords are a critical component in the protection of organizational assets. It is essential that employees are well-informed about potential attacks and effective defenses. To address this, we developed password security awareness-raising materials through a systematic, iterative process. The materials were based on existing literature, feedback from independent experts, and input from non-expert users. These materials were then evaluated with employees from three organizations. Our results indicate that participants improved their ability to (1) distinguish secure from insecure password-related behaviors in various scenarios and (2) assess the security of passwords. These improvements were still evident six months after the initial training. Therefore, the developed awareness-raising materials contribute significantly to enhancing password security within organizations.

## 1 Introduction
Many users face challenges when choosing, managing, or remembering their passwords, leading to insecure password practices. Consequently, targeting passwords is a common tactic in attacks on organizations. In 2016, 63% of breaches were attributed to weak, default, or stolen passwords, increasing to 81% in 2017. Passwords can be compromised through various means, such as guessing, phishing, eavesdropping, and observation. Many users are unaware of these attack vectors and how to defend against them, making them vulnerable to security breaches. The financial impact of such breaches can be severe, with the average cost of a data breach in 2017 being $3.62 million. To prevent such consequences, it is crucial that employees understand the attacks targeting passwords and user accounts, as well as the corresponding defenses. Information security awareness-raising materials are essential for building organizational resilience against such threats. However, many existing materials provide impractical advice, such as using only complex passwords, changing them frequently, and never writing them down. This advice is problematic for users and does not reflect current best practices.

In this work, we address the need to make users aware of different attacks on passwords and user accounts, as well as effective defenses. We developed an awareness-raising material through an iterative process, incorporating research literature, expert feedback, and user input. The material was evaluated with employees from three organizations, and the results show significant improvements in participants' ability to assess password-related behaviors and the security of passwords. These improvements were sustained even six months after the training. The developed material is freely available online, allowing users and organizations to benefit from it.

## 2 Related Work
Information security awareness-raising materials are vital for maintaining security in organizations. Lin and Kunnathur [20] developed a theory of end-user information security competence, emphasizing the importance of knowledge and skills, including awareness. Numerous studies have highlighted the significance of advice and awareness-raising materials. Institutions like NIST recommend distributing such materials to employees, and some industry standards require it. However, existing password advice often contradicts current research. Zhang-Kennedy et al. [37] and Murray and Malone [21] have identified that many established rules, such as frequent password changes, do not align with current best practices. Research has also provided recommendations for developing effective awareness materials, including relevance, actionability, positive framing, and the use of visual elements. Fuller et al. [12] emphasize the importance of presenting problems before solutions, while Tsohou et al. [30] recommend using positive stimuli and relative frequencies to overcome cognitive biases. Expert feedback and behavior have been shown to be valuable in providing practical advice for lay-users. For example, Ion et al. [17] and Stobert and Biddle [28] found that using password managers and two-factor authentication are key strategies. Zhang-Kennedy et al. [36] demonstrated the effectiveness of graphical elements in awareness materials.

## 3 Development of the Awareness-Raising Material
The goal of this work is to create an awareness-raising material that describes possible attacks on passwords and user accounts, along with effective defenses. We employed a three-iteration process for development.

### 3.1 First Iteration - Based on Literature
The first iteration involved identifying relevant content from the literature on password security. We used positive phrasing and relative frequencies to address cognitive biases. The material includes introductory sections on potential attackers and the consequences of successful attacks, followed by descriptions of specific attacks and defenses. The selection of attacks is based on Bonneau et al. [5], with additional consideration of reset mechanisms. Defenses include the use of password managers and two-factor authentication, as recommended by Ion et al. [17]. The attacks are ordered by "ascending distance from the user," and each description is divided into three parts: attack, defense, and further hints.

### 3.2 Second Iteration - Incorporation of Structured Expert Feedback
To ensure completeness and correctness, we incorporated structured feedback from 30 independent information security experts. Thirteen experts provided detailed feedback, which led to several improvements:
- **More Detailed Consequences:** We expanded the section on possible consequences with more concrete examples.
- **Split of Network Attacks:** We split the section on network communication attacks into unencrypted and encrypted communication.
- **Physical Access:** We added information on physical access to devices, including scenarios where devices are left unattended.

### 3.3 Third Iteration - Incorporation of Lay-User Feedback
The third iteration focused on the appeal and understandability of the material. We incorporated informal feedback from lay-users to improve the visual elements and overall clarity.

## 4 Evaluation
The developed material was evaluated with employees from three organizations. The evaluation aimed to assess the participants' ability to distinguish secure from insecure password-related behaviors and to assess the security of passwords. The results showed significant improvements in both areas, which were sustained over a six-month period.

## 5 Discussion
The results of our evaluation demonstrate that the developed awareness-raising material effectively improves employees' understanding of password security. The material's positive reception and the sustained improvements in participants' abilities highlight its value in enhancing organizational security. Future work will focus on further refining the material and expanding its reach.

## 6 Conclusion
In summary, our systematic approach to developing and evaluating password security awareness-raising materials has shown promising results. The material contributes to improving password security in organizations by enhancing employees' ability to recognize and defend against password-related attacks. The material is freely available online, enabling widespread adoption and benefit.
