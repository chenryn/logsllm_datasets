  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
Exact highlight underline alignment all the time (even after heat death of the
universe).
## Current Behavior
(In my app) after page reload the line goes under the second tab. It fixes
itself on second render or on window resize.
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
I don't have a small project to reproduce this. I made only this video

If you have no idea why it happens just close this issue (I will try to fix it
later).
