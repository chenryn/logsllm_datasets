User: In google app engine, can I call "get_or_insert" from inside a transaction?
The reason I ask is because I'm not sure if there is some conflict with having this run its own transaction inside an already running transaction.
Thanks!
Assistant: No. get_or_insert is syntactic sugar for a transactional function that fetches or inserts a record. You can implement it yourself trivially, but that will only work if the record you're operating on is in the same entity group as the rest of the entities in the current transaction, or if you have cross-group transactions enabled.
