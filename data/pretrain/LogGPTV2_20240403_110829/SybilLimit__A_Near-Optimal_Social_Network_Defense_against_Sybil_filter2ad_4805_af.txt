O(log n) is asymptotic behavior. It is not necessary to do
so either, since all we need to conﬁrm is that rather small w
values are already sufﬁcient for SybilLimit to work well.
For Friendster and LiveJournal, we use w = 10 (see
Table 2). Random routes do not seem to reach good enough
mixing for SybilLimit with w values much smaller than
10 (e.g., 5) in these two social networks. We use w = 15
for DBLP. As expected, DBLP has a worse mixing property
than the other social networks. Our results will show that
these small w values are already sufﬁcient to enable good
enough mixing in our large-scale social networks (with 105
to around 106 nodes) for SybilLimit to work well.
It is worth noting that social networks are well-known
to have groups or communities where intra-group edges
are much denser than inter-group edges [3, 15, 23, 37]. In
fact, there are explicitly-deﬁned communities in LiveJournal
for users to join, while people in DBLP by deﬁnition form
research communities. Our results thus show that somewhat
counter-intuitively and despite such groups, the sparse inter-
group edges in these real-world social networks are sufﬁcient
to provide good mixing properties.
Results: SybilLimit’s end guarantees. We use the w val-
ues from Table 2 to simulate SybilLimit and determine the
number of sybil nodes accepted. Our simulator does not
implement the estimation process for r. Rather, we directly
use the r values from Table 2, which are obtained based
on the value of m and the Birthday Paradox. We use 4 for
the universal constant h in all our experiments. We have
observed (results not included) that h = 2.5 is already sufﬁ-
cient in most cases, while excessively large h (e.g., 10) can
unnecessarily weaken the guarantees (though not asymptoti-
cally). We always simulate the adversary’s optimal strategy
(i.e., worst-case for SybilLimit).
Figures 8 to 11 present the number of sybil nodes ac-
cepted by a randomly chosen veriﬁer V (as a fraction of
the number of honest nodes n), in each social network. We
present a fraction to allow comparison across social networks
with different n. We have repeated the experiments from a
number of veriﬁers, yielding similar results. For all cases,
we experiment with g up to the point where the number of
sybil nodes accepted reaches n. The ﬁgures further break
down the sybil nodes accepted into those accepted by V ’s
non-escaping tails versus those accepted by V ’s escaping
tails. The ﬁrst component is bounded by the intersection
condition while the second is bounded by the balance con-
dition. In all ﬁgures, the number of sybil nodes accepted
grows roughly linearly with g. The asymptotic guarantee of
SybilLimit is O(log n) sybil nodes accepted per attack edge.
Figures 8 to 11 show that this O(log n) asymptotic term
translates to around between 10 (in Friendster, LiveJournal,
and Kleinberg) to 20 (in DBLP). As a concrete numerical

comparison with SybilGuard, SybilGuard [42] uses random
routes of length l = 1906 in the million-node Kleinberg
graph. Because SybilGuard accepts l sybil nodes per attack
edge, this translates to 1906 sybil nodes accepted per attack
edge for Kleinberg. Thus numerically in Kleinberg, Sybil-
Limit reduces the number of sybil nodes accepted by nearly
200-fold over SybilGuard.
One can also view Figures 8 to 11 from another per-
spective. The three data sets Friendster, LiveJournal, and
Kleinberg all have roughly one million nodes. Therefore, in
order for the number of sybil nodes accepted to reach n, the
number of attack edges needs to be around 100,000. Put it
another way, the adversary needs to establish 100,000 social
trust relationships with honest users in the system. As a quick
comparison under Kleinberg, SybilGuard will accept n sybil
nodes once g reaches around 500 (since l = 1906). Some
simple experiments further show that with g ≥ 15, 000, the
escaping probability of the random routes in SybilGuard
will be above 0.5 and SybilGuard can no longer provide
any guarantees at all. Finally, DBLP is much smaller (with
100,000 nodes) and because of the slightly larger w needed
for DBLP, the number of sybil nodes accepted will reach n
roughly when g is 5,000.
Finally, we have also performed experiments to inves-
tigate SybilLimit’s guarantees on much smaller social net-
works with only 100 nodes. To do so, we extract 100-node
subgraphs from our social network data sets. As a concise
summary, we observe that the number of sybil nodes ac-
cepted per attack edge is still around 10 to 20.
10. Conclusion
This paper presented SybilLimit, a near-optimal defense
against sybil attacks using social networks. Compared
√
to our previous SybilGuard protocol [42] that accepted
O(
n log n) sybil nodes per attack edge, SybilLimit ac-
cepts only O(log n) sybil nodes per attack edge. Further-
more, SybilLimit provides this guarantee even when the
number of attack edges grows to o(n/ log n). SybilLimit’s
improvement derives from the combination of multiple novel
techniques: i) leveraging multiple independent instances of
the random route protocol to perform many short random
routes, ii) exploiting intersections on edges instead of nodes,
iii) using the novel balance condition to deal with escaping
tails of the veriﬁer, and iv) using the novel benchmarking
technique to safely estimate r. Finally, our results on real-
world social networks conﬁrmed their fast mixing property,
and thus validated the fundamental assumption behind Sybil-
Limit’s (and SybilGuard’s) approach. As future work, we
intend to implement SybilLimit within the context of some
real-world applications and demonstrate its utility.
