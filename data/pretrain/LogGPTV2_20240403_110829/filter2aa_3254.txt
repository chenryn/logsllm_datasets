Abstract
Most hackers can use Nmap for simple port scanning and OS 
detection, but the Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) takes scanning to a 
whole new level.  Nmap's high-speed networking engine can now 
spider web sites for SQL injection vulnerabilities, brute-force crack 
and query MSRPC services, find open proxies, and more. Nmap 
includes more than 125 NSE scripts for network discovery, 
vulnerability detection, exploitation, and authentication cracking.
Rather than give a dry overview of NSE, Fyodor and Nmap co-
maintainer David Fifield demonstrate practical solutions to common 
problems. They have scanned millions of hosts with NSE and will 
discuss vulnerabilities found on enterprise networks and how Nmap 
can be used to quickly detect those problems on your own systems. 
Then they demonstrate how easy it is to write custom NSE scripts to 
meet the needs of your network.  Finally they take a quick look at 
recent Nmap developments and provide a preview of what is soon to 
come. This presentation does not require any NSE experience, but it 
wouldn't hurt to read http://nmap.org/book/nse.html.

Resources
These slides are just a teaser. Final slides will be posted 
by August 1, 2010 to 
http://insecure.org/presentations/BHDC10/. 
Our goal is to make this presentation useful, informative, 
and entertaining even to those who know very little about 
Nmap and the Nmap Scripting Engine.  But you can get the 
most out of this presentation by first reading about (and 
trying!) Nmap at http://nmap.org and the Nmap Scripting 
Engine at http://nmap.org/book/nse.html.
