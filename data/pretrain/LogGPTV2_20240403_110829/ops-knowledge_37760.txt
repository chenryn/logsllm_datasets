User: How to check the TCP/UDP network connection status of the current system through Linux commands?
Assistant: You can use the following commands to view the current system's TCP/UDP network connection status: 1. netstat command: You can use the netstat command to view the current system's network connection status. By default, the netstat command will display all active TCP connections, UDP ports, and Unix sockets. Options can be used to filter the required information, for example: # Display all network connections $ netstat -a # Display all TCP connections $ netstat -at # Display all UDP connections $ netstat -au 2. ss command: ss command can display more detailed Information, faster and more efficient than the netstat command, because the ss command uses faster data structures and algorithms, and can display TCP or UDP connections through options, for example: # Display all TCP connections $ ss -t # Display all UDP connections $ ss -u 3. lsof command: The lsof command can list the process of opening the file, you can use the lsof command to view the network connection, for example: # Display all TCP connections $ lsof -i TCP # Display all UDP connections $ lsof -i UDP above It is a method to view the TCP/UDP network connection status of the current system through Linux commands.
