Single: This heuristic is used for the case where a single AS is present in r’s AS fre-
quency matrix. In this case, we (trivially) assign r to this AS.
Election: This heuristic assigns a router r to the AS with the highest frequency in r’s AS
frequency matrix, assuming routers tend to have more interfaces in the address space of
their owner. Election produces an ambiguous assignment when multiple ASes have the
same (highest) frequency, which occurred for 14% of the multi-AS routers in our set.
Neighbor: For this heuristic, we ﬁrst determine the set of single-AS routers to which
r is connected (its single-AS neighbors). We create a new AS frequency matrix that
counts the number of single-AS neighbors of r from each AS. The Neighbor heuristic
assigns r to the AS with the largest frequency (most single-AS neighbors), based on the
intuition that a router is connected to a larger number of single-AS routers in its owner
AS. Neighbor produces an ambiguous assignment when multiple ASes have the same
(highest) frequency.
Customer: This heuristic uses the AS relationship dataset to assign relationships to
each pair of ASes from r’s AS frequency matrix1. Customer assigns r to the AS
inferred to be a customer of every other AS in r’s AS frequency matrix. This heuris-
tic is based on the common practice that customer and provider routers typically in-
terconnect using addresses from the provider’s address space. Consequently, a router
with interfaces from both the customer and provider address spaces is assigned to the
customer.
1 Not every possible AS pair in r’s frequency matrix has a known relationship; many AS pairs
have no link between them in the original BGP AS graph, so no deﬁned relationship.

Degree: For this heuristic, we ﬁrst generate an AS-level graph by assuming full-mesh
connectivity among ASes from each router’s AS frequency matrix. We then use this
graph to generate an AS degree for each AS. Degree assigns router r to the smallest-
degree AS from r’s AS frequency matrix, i.e., the AS most likely to be the customer
AS, based on similar intuition as the Customer heuristic.
2.4 Evaluation of AS Assignment Heuristics
We next evaluate our AS assignment heuristics by comparing our AS assignment with
our ground truth datasets. We classify each router inferred by kapar into the following
sets. If a router r0 has at least one interface in Ii, then we assign r0 to the set Ri
(the set of routers owned by ISPi). If a router r1 has at least one interface from the
set ¯Ii, then we assign r1 to the set ¯Ri (inferred routers not owned by ISPi). We found
39 routers (0.6% of the total analyzed) with interfaces in both Ii and ¯Ii or Ii and
Ij, which contradicts the meaning of these data sets (describing mutually exclusive
routers). These discrepancies are due to false positives in our alias resolution process,
so we discard them for the purpose of evaluating our AS assignment heuristics. All but
three routers in Ri have a single AS in Ai (Ai is the set of ASes owned by ISPi), which
means there is a single successful assignment for most routers. For the three routers
with multiple ASes in Ai, successful assignment is ambiguous, and we omitted these
routers from the evaluation, leaving us with |R1| = 3,405 and | ¯R1| = 2,254, |R2| = 241
and | ¯R2| = 86, |RG| = 37 and | ¯RG| = 0, |RL| = 32 and | ¯RL| = 0, |RT| = 17 and | ¯RT|
= 0, |RN| = 16 and | ¯RN| = 0, and |RC| = 8 and | ¯RC| = 0. We call the combined set
of all routers R = ∪Ri, those owned by some network in our ground truth dataset,
and the set ¯R = ∪ ¯Ri those we know not to be owned by a speciﬁc network in our
ground truth datasets. Using our knowledge of interface ownership, we derive |R| =
3,795 and |¯R| = 2,340 routers on which to test AS assignment heuristics. We consider
H(r), the AS to which a certain heuristic assigns router r, as a successful assignment
if ((r ∈ Ri)&&(H(r) ∈ Ai))||((r ∈ ¯Ri)&&(H(r) ∈ ¯Ai)), i.e., if the router is in R
and H(r) selects an AS owned by the same ISP as the router, or the router is in ¯R and
H(r) selects an AS not owned by the ISP known to not own router.
Section 2.3 outlined the cases for which each heuristic provides an ambiguous as-
signment. To resolve ambiguous assignments, i.e., break ties, we paired each heuristic
with a second one. We tested all combinations of pairs of heuristics to ﬁnd the best tie-
breaker2 for each primary heuristic, resulting in the following combinations: Election
+ Degree, Neighbor + Degree, Customer + Neighbor, and Degree + Neighbor.
Figure 2 shows the fraction of routers we assigned successfully (bars labeled “S”),
and the fraction that were failures (bars labeled “F”), determined using the ground truth
datasets. Figure 2 presents these results separately for routers in R and ¯R, and for differ-
ent assignment heuristics. We found that for single-AS routers, all heuristics are either
successful for the 67% in R or failures for the 33% in ¯R. The explanation is straight-
forward: All routers in Ri or ¯Ri have at least one interface in ISPi’s address space (not
necessarily being used by ISPi), and by extension an AS in Ai. For single-AS routers in

Ri, the AS must belong to Ai, and the assignment is a success. For single-AS routers
in ¯Ri, assigning it to that single AS results in failure. For these single-AS routers in ¯Ri,
we have most likely failed to either see or accurately resolve the alias for the router’s
interface in address space not owned by ISPi.
Figure 2 shows that when a router has interfaces from multiple ASes, the most ef-
fective stand-alone heuristic was Neighbor, which successfully assigned 70% of these
routers. Election + Degree was the most successful combination of heuristics (mainly
due to fewer failures on routers from ¯R), with a success rate of 80%.
3 Applications of AS Assignment
In this section, we use the AS assignment heuristics described in Section 2.3 to produce
a dual graph that merges router and AS-level topologies. We then describe two appli-
cations of this dual graph construct – producing representative dual topologies of the
Internet, and improving the accuracy of AS-level traceroute tools.

Previous work [11,21] has fo-
cused on generating AS-level
graphs of arbitrary size, while pre-
serving the correlation structure
seen in real Internet topology, e.g.,
correlations between the number
of customers, providers and peers
of an AS, or between degrees of
ASes at each end of an inter-
domain link. We seek to extend
this previous work by designing a
graph generator that can produce
Internet-like dual topologies, i.e.,
AS annotated router-level graphs,
of arbitrary size, preserving the
statistical properties of the Inter-
net’s dual graph. Another applica-
tion is to security-related situational awareness objectives, which require knowledge of
the internal structure of ASes. We focus on two questions: How many inferred single-
AS (internal) and multi-AS (border) routers do ASes own (with the aforementioned
caveat that we may mis-characterize routers as single-AS if we undersample or mis-
resolve interfaces)? Is there a correlation between an AS’s degree and the number of
routers it owns? We use the heuristics from Section 2.3 to assign routers to ASes, and
measure the router ownership properties of resulting ASes. Our results do not represent
the actual number of routers owned by an AS, only the number observed in our data
samples.

We ﬁrst examine the number of single-AS routers owned by an AS, which does not

router to the same AS. The top graph in Figure 3 shows a scatter plot of the number
of single-AS routers inferred per AS versus the AS degree as observed in BGP data
(from Routeviews2 and RIPE’s RRC12). We conﬁrmed the expected positive correla-
tion, where ASes with larger degrees (which typically represent larger transit providers)
tend to have more single-AS routers. Several outliers have many single-AS routers and
relatively low AS degrees (1 or 2). The top 10 such outliers corresponded to ASes that
were either regional networks of a larger transit provider, or smaller administrative do-
mains within a large transit provider. Consequently, these ASes had just one or two
observed AS links, to the backbone AS of the larger transit provider. It is plausible
that such regional transit networks or access provider networks have a large number of
single-AS routers.

The bottom graph in Figure 3 shows the median number of single-AS routers per
AS as a function of the AS degree. We bin ASes according to their degree, ensuring a
minimum bin size of 50 ASes. We see a strong positive correlation between the number
of single-AS routers and the inferred AS degree, which is expected since ASes with
larger AS degrees typically represent transit providers, which need many routers. ASes
with lower degrees are typically stub networks with less internal routing infrastructure.
Figure 4 shows the number of
multi-AS routers owned by an AS
as a function of AS degree, for dif-
ferent AS assignment heuristics. We
found similar results with the Elec-
tion, Neighbor and Degree assign-
ment heuristics, and a strong positive
correlation between the number of
multi-AS routers of an AS and its de-
gree. The Customer heuristic shows
a much weaker correlation between
the number of multi-AS routers and
AS degree. Customer favors lower
