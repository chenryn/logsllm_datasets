# Summary of the new feature/enhancement
I'm using Vim as default editor on Linux, also doing some job on multiple vim
windows. As you know, Vim uses Ctrl-W to switch between its window, but it
also causes closing tab on microsoft terminal. Would you please remove Ctrl-W
from default keybindings?
Thank you!
