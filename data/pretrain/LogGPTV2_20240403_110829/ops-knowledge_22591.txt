Ease of use: Ansible uses Playbook based on YAML syntax for task arrangement, which is easy to understand and use. 2.

It does not need to install any agent and client software on the target server, which can reduce the intrusion of the target server and reduce the cost of configuration and maintenance. 3. Extensive support: Ansible can manage a variety of operating systems, software and services, and can manage physical machines, virtual machines, and cloud platforms. 4. Separation of front-end and back-end: Ansible uses the back-end to perform tasks, and the front-end does not need to keep connected while running, which can improve execution efficiency. 5. Version control: Ansible uses the readable YAML language for task arrangement, and version control tools such as Git can be used for version management and rollback of Playbooks. 6. Extensible: Ansible supports custom modules and plug-ins, which can be extended through the API to meet specific needs. 7. High security: Ansible connects to the server through SSH encryption, which is safe and reliable. To sum up, Ansible is a powerful but easy-to-use and maintain automation tool, which can significantly reduce the workload of service management and operation and maintenance, and improve the reliability and consistency of services.
