### Issue Type:
Bug Report

### Ansible Version:
1.7.1

### Environment:
- Operating System: Ubuntu 12.04
- Python Version: 2.7.3 (in a virtual environment)

### Summary:
I frequently use the following command without any issues:
```bash
ansible-vault edit myfile.yml.encrypted --vault-password-file=~/ansible_password
```
However, the following command fails:
```bash
ansible-vault decrypt myfile.yml.encrypted --vault-password-file=~/ansible_password
```
The error message I receive is:
```
ERROR: Values instance has no attribute 'vault_password_file'
```

### Steps to Reproduce:
1. Generate a random password and save it to a file:
   ```bash
   openssl rand -base64 12 > /tmp/ansible-password
   ```
2. Create a simple YAML file:
   ```bash
   echo 'foo: bar' > /tmp/file.yml
   ```
3. Encrypt the YAML file using the generated password:
   ```bash
   ansible-vault encrypt /tmp/file.yml --vault-password-file=/tmp/ansible-password
   ```
4. Edit the encrypted file (this step works as expected):
   ```bash
   ansible-vault edit /tmp/file.yml --vault-password-file=/tmp/ansible-password
   ```
5. Attempt to decrypt the file (this step fails):
   ```bash
   ansible-vault decrypt /tmp/file.yml --vault-password-file=/tmp/ansible-password
   ```

### Expected Results:
The `decrypt` command should successfully decrypt the file.

### Actual Results:
The `decrypt` command fails with the following error:
```
ERROR: Values instance has no attribute 'vault_password_file'
```
