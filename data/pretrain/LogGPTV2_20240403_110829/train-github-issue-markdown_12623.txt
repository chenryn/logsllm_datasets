I've found two problems of Atom's soft wrapping:
  1. Chinese and Japanese language does not use spaces to separate characters, it causes that Atom treats Chinese sentence as a extremely-long "word" and does not perform correct wrap. According to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_breaking_rules_in_East_Asian_languages], a "CJK Word" is something like `(Opening punctuation)*(Han character | Kana)(Trailing punctuation|Traialing Kana)*`.
  2. Atom cannot handle non-monospaced fonts correctly. Han characters and Kanas are much wider than Latin characters.
