Abstract
Personal Identi(cid:27)cation Numbers (PINs) are widely used as
an access control mechanism for digital assets (e.g., smart-
phones), (cid:27)nancial assets (e.g., ATM cards), and physical as-
sets (e.g., locks for garage doors or homes). Using semi-
structured interviews (n=35), participants reported on PIN
usage for di(cid:29)erent types of assets, including how users
choose, share, inherit, and reuse PINs, as well as behaviour
following the compromise of a PIN. We (cid:27)nd that memora-
bility is the most important criterion when choosing a PIN,
more so than security or concerns of reuse. Updating or
changing a PIN is very uncommon, even when a PIN is com-
promised. Participants reported sharing PINs for one type
of asset with acquaintances but inadvertently reused them
for other assets, thereby subjecting themselves to potential
risks. Participants also reported using PINs originally set
by previous homeowners for physical devices (e.g., alarm or
keypad door entry systems). While aware of the risks of not
updating PINs, this did not always deter participants from
using inherited PINs, as they were often missing instruc-
tions on how to update them. Given the expected increase
in PIN-protected assets (e.g., loyalty cards, smart locks, and
web apps), we provide suggestions and future research di-
rections to better support users with multiple digital and
non-digital assets and more secure human-device interac-
tion when utilizing PINs.
1 Introduction
Knowledge-based authentication (e.g., passwords or PINs)
is widely used as it is a well-tested technology and simple to
administer [39]. However, research suggests that there are
persistent challenges with password usability [7] and mem-
orability [16, 20]. Additionally, passwords are too cumber-
some to use for protecting certain classes of assets, such as
a car or garage door, which limits their utility.
∗A version of this paper is appears at the 2020 Annual Computer Se-
curity Applications Conference (ACSAC’20).
With the proliferation of technology, it is somewhat
ironic that passwords “stubbornly survive and reproduce
with every new website” [7]. Challenges with passwords
can lead to frustration among users. To address these lin-
gering concerns, several mobile and web apps now provide
PIN-based authentication as the default option [38]. Mi-
crosoft is also planning to remove the password option from
the Windows 10 login screen while keeping PIN as one of
the login options [35]. Loyalty cards also require PINs to re-
deem points, and a survey indicates that an average Cana-
dian participates in twelve loyalty programs, which is a 25%
increase over four years [32]. Keyless home locks require
PINs to authenticate, and their market is forecasted to reach
35 million units by 2027 [21]. As technologies requiring se-
curity in the form of PINs become more prevalent, it is criti-
cal to understand how people choose and manage PINs, not
just for digital and (cid:27)nancial assets, but for the wide array
of physical assets for which PINs are used.
In studying PIN management, we broadly categorize
PINs into three categories of protected assets: digital (e.g.,
to unlock digital devices or authenticate to mobile and
web apps), (cid:27)nancial (e.g., ATM cards or banking apps),
and physical (e.g., digital keypad based entry systems for
garages or homes). Researchers have explored PIN-based
authentication for (cid:27)nancial assets, notably Bonneau et al.
studied chip-and-PIN systems [8], as well as Wang et al.
studied the guessability of PINs as derived from leaked
password datasets [47].
We argue that a broader analysis of PIN usage needs con-
sideration for several reasons. First, di(cid:29)erent types of assets
may be subject to di(cid:29)erent types of attacks (e.g., smart-
phone PINs might be more susceptible to shoulder surf-
ing [14] than PINs used to protect physical assets), and
prevalent reuse across these categories may result in un-
desirable consequences and increased risks. Second, PINs
for certain types of assets may be more likely to be shared
(e.g., (cid:27)nancial vs. digital asset PINs with a family member),
and their careless reuse may result in unauthorized usage.
Third, physical PINs are more likely to be shared among
family members or by trusted individuals within their net-
1
work, which leads to interesting issues surrounding selec-
tion of PINs.
Prior work has yet to focus deeply on ways to address
the broader considerations associated with PIN usage from
a user perspective.
In this study, we aim to investigate
how users create, manage, and share PINs across di(cid:29)er-
ent types of assets. To this end, we conducted hour-long,
semi-structured interviews with 35 participants. We chose
a semi-structured methodology to unpack and better un-
derstand the themes relating to use of PINs. Our (cid:27)ndings
include:
• When selecting a PIN, participants were more likely to
prioritize memorability of the PIN over security. While
participants reported that reusing a PIN was a low fac-
tor in selecting a PIN for a given asset, the majority
of participants (28/35 or 80%) reported reusing PINs.
This reuse was across di(cid:29)erent asset types and often
resulted in PINs for physical devices (e.g., bike lock)
moving into the digital world and vice versa.
• Despite more than two-thirds (71%) of our participants
describing situations where their PINs were compro-
mised, less than half of those (45%) reported updating
their PINs. This can be attributed in part to concerns
relating to memorability and usability of PINs.
• PIN update is very uncommon, overall, and when it
does occur, it is often due to reasons of security or
memorability (26/49 of reported PIN updates). How-
ever, for physical assets such as garage doors, a lack
of update may be due to the nature of these devices.
Six out of nine owners of PIN-protected garage doors
reported that they were unable to update their PIN as
they did not know how to perform this action, despite
desiring to do so.
• Di(cid:29)erences between asset types in(cid:30)uence the secu-
rity measures adopted by users. Participants were less
worried about compromising their physical PINs com-
pared to digital PINs, as potential attackers breaking
into an entity protected by a physical PIN may face
criminal prosecution, e.g., breaking and entering, de-
spite the fact that digital or (cid:27)nancial PINs can also lead
to personal, (cid:27)nancial, or criminal harm.
Based on our (cid:27)ndings, we propose three areas for further
exploration. First, new intervention and strategies for as-
sisting users in selecting and recalling PINs would address
many of the observed shortcomings. While password man-
agers are an obvious solution, their usage is mostly focused
on di(cid:29)erent types of accounts. However, current password
managers could be augmented to assist these tasks. Second,
as PINs become more pervasive, users may become more
concerned with the threat of shoulder sur(cid:27)ng attacks. To
counteract, the research community should focus on devel-
oping new tools to assist users in identifying instances of
shoulder sur(cid:27)ng, and provide guidance on mitigation prac-
tices. Finally, given the plethora of PIN usage scenarios,
unifying methods for updating PINs, similar to how pass-
word changing has mostly stabilized around standard prac-
tice, would make a di(cid:29)erence in encouraging PIN updates
after compromise. Of course, for physical assets, this is not
a simple task. Perhaps augmented reality tools could be
used to address this gap in the future, to link these physical
assists to known documentation.
2 Related Work
In this section, we explore related work in areas including:
PIN choices for human-chosen PINs, attacks on PINs, mem-
orability and reusability of PINs, and lifecycle and manage-
ment of authentication credentials in general. We also com-
pare and contrast our (cid:27)ndings for speci(cid:27)c topics related to
PIN usage with (cid:27)ndings for other authentication methods
in Section 5.
2.1 Human-Chosen PINs
Users face several choices when choosing their authentica-
tion secrets. Selection is often in(cid:30)uenced by factors such
as memorability of the chosen secret, reuse of an existing
secret, usability (including time to authenticate and error
rates), and security [7, 11, 41]. Von Zezschwitz et al. [46]
have explored users’ choices for text-based password com-
position, while Biddle et al. [5] have summarized research
that explores users’ choices of graphical passwords. PINs
are less complex than text-based passwords [26] and di(cid:29)er-
ent from graphical passwords since PINs require memoriz-
ing digits.
Amitay collected PINs surreptitiously from an iPhone
app in the App Store. Their data showed that ten of the
most commonly used 4-digit PINs represented 15% of all
PINs in use [3]. Furthermore, most of these PINs followed
simple patterns of repeating or consecutive digits.
In a
seminal work, Bonneau et al. [8] explored the user selection
preferences for bank card PINs (e.g., chip-and-PIN systems)
using survey data and approximated PINs from leaked
password data and Amitay’s dataset. They found that an
attacker who comes into the possession of a lost wallet
with a bank card and owner’s ID in it has about an 8%
chance of guessing the correct PIN due to the widespread
use of birthdays for PINs. Wang et al. [47] compared
characteristics (guessability, entropy, and distribution) of
chosen 4-/6-digit PINs between English and Chinese users.
Among other (cid:27)ndings, they showed that the top 5-8% most
popular PINs account for over 50% of PIN datasets. Markert
et al. [33] collected data on 4-/6-digit PINs, also (cid:27)nding
high prevalence of popular PINs, and that the bene(cid:27)t of
using 6-digit PINs is minimal (or worse) than a 4-digit PIN.
Concurrent to this research, Casimiro et al. [10] conducted
an MTurk survey to study PIN choices and reuse and
con(cid:27)rm our (cid:27)ndings. While these studies o(cid:29)er an insight
into the prevalent reuse and not-so-secret nature of human
2
PIN choice, our research extends prior work by examining
users’ motivations behind their choices.
2.2 Attacks on PINs and Defences
A range of studies have focused on the development and
evaluation of novel interaction techniques to defend against
shoulder sur(cid:27)ng attacks [12, 13, 15, 31, 45]. Researchers
have also explored novel side channel-based attacks on PIN
authentication, but these attacks require special equipment
or skillful attackers [1, 19, 48]. Since these e(cid:29)orts are only
tangentially related to our work, we discuss more related
works that study attacks and the recourse of victims.
Aviv et al. [4] and Khan et al. [28], empirically evalu-
ated the success of shoulder sur(cid:27)ng attacks on PINs under
various conditions. De Luca et al. [14] found that German
ATM users reported a low incidence of PIN shielding dur-
ing ATM use. They also reported a signi(cid:27)cant in(cid:30)uence of
factors such as distractions, physical hindrance, trust rela-
tionships, and memorability on security in PIN-based ATM
use. Harbach et al. [22] conducted an online survey and
(cid:27)eld study to understand users’ smartphone unlocking be-
haviour. Of users that use a lock code (including PIN and
graphical pattern users) for their smartphones, 65% were
not or mostly not concerned about a shoulder sur(cid:27)ng at-
tack on their code. Other related work includes the study
by Eiband et al. [18], who explored shoulder sur(cid:27)ng attacks
and defences during normal smartphone usage, without fo-
cusing on authentication.
Our work expands the existing body of knowledge by
exploring attacks on PINs, the defences that are employed,
and the recourse of users when they suspect that the attacks
are successful for various digital and non-digital assets.
2.3 Security and Memorability of PINs
In an attempt to encourage users to be more secure in their
authentication behaviour, researchers have explored meth-
ods to generate and help users memorize secure PINs. Kim
and Huh [29] found that using a blacklist policy of restrict-
ing around 200 commonly used PINs signi(cid:27)cantly increases
the randomness (as measured using Shannon entropy, not
guessability [6]) of PINs without signi(cid:27)cantly increasing
the memorability overhead. Findings from a study by Mark-
ert et al. [33] indicate that even small blacklists of disal-
lowed PINs can substantially improve the security (as mea-
sured using guessability) of user-chosen PINs against throt-
tled attackers. Schechter and Bonneau [41] proposed two
techniques to memorize secure PINs and conducted a study
to show that the proposed memorization techniques were
e(cid:29)ective, thereby reducing the likelihood of writing down
the new PIN. Stanekova and Stanek [43] and Huh et al. [25]
also explored e(cid:29)ective methods to generate and memorize
PINs. Our work explores memorability and usage issues
surrounding PINs without exploring users’ memorization
3
strategies, and our (cid:27)ndings provide further motivation for
the development of e(cid:29)ective PIN memorization techniques.
Renaud and Volkamer [40] conducted an online study
to evaluate two PIN memorization assistance techniques.
While they reported no improvements in PIN memoriza-
tion due to the users not using the memorization aids, they
reported on the strategies people adopted for PIN memo-
rization and whether participants wrote down their PINs.
They also identi(cid:27)ed reasons why participants updated their
PINs. However, they did not specify the rate at which di(cid:29)er-
ent PIN changes occurred and for what reason. We conduct
a more holistic and broader investigation of these phenom-
ena. We categorize and quantify the reasons why partic-
ipants change PINs and report on instances when partici-
pants chose not to change their PINs after PIN compromise
for di(cid:29)erent asset categories.
2.4 Lifecycle of Authentication Credentials
Although the lifecycle and management of PINs have not
been subjects of much research (either in digital or non-
digital contexts), researchers have explored these topics for
passwords. Stobert and Biddle [44] investigated how users
managed their passwords through a series of interviews.
They reported that users ration their e(cid:29)orts to protect their
accounts best, and many users reuse passwords as well as
adjust them for di(cid:29)erent accounts. They also found that
people were willing to put more e(cid:29)ort into the management
of accounts with higher perceived importance (i.e., bank ac-
count passwords). Hayashi and Hong [23] conducted a two-
week diary study to examine password usage of 20 users.
They collected data on the frequency and location of pass-
word use, and the use of password aids. Based on their (cid:27)nd-
ings, they provide suggestions to improve the password au-
thentication experiences of users.
As PIN-based authentication increasingly becomes one
of the default authentication options for digital, physical,
and (cid:27)nancial assets,
it is important to understand PIN
lifecycle and management across di(cid:29)erent assets. Our
study is the (cid:27)rst of its kind to report a holistic view of the
lifecycle and management of PINs, thereby highlighting
interrelationships across PINs for di(cid:29)erent types of assets.
3 Study Design and Methodology
Design The aim of our study is to better understand
how individuals use PINs across a variety of assets.
However, there are several challenges to such holistic
