**Documentation:**

- **Returns:**
  - `out`: `ndarray`
    - A contiguous array with the same shape and content as `a`. If `dtype` is specified, the array will have that data type.

However, there appears to be an inconsistency in the behavior. Consider the following example:

```python
import numpy as np

a = np.array(1)
print(a.shape)  # Output: ()
print(np.ascontiguousarray(a).shape)  # Output: (1,)
```

The implementation of `np.ascontiguousarray` is as follows:

```python
return np.array(a, dtype=dtype, copy=False, order='C', ndmin=1)
```

This implementation ensures that the returned array has at least one dimension, which explains why the shape of `np.ascontiguousarray(a)` is `(1,)` instead of `()`.
