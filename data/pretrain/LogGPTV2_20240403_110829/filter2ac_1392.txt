**Title: Botconf2017 - SOCKS as a Service and Botnet Discovery**

On the internet, while anonymity can be maintained to a certain extent, your online activities are often traceable. When you visit a website, the server can identify that your IP address is associated with an Autonomous System Number (ASN) belonging to an Internet Service Provider (ISP) on the East Coast of the United States. 

As the webpage loads, third-party fraud detection scripts, typically written in JavaScript, collect various details about your browser, such as local time, installed plugins like Flash, and other attributes, to create a unique fingerprint. These scripts also cross-reference your IP address with the zip code linked to the credit card you are using, and may check if it matches the netblock from which you frequently log in.

This presentation focuses on the second component: the use of Secure Sockets (SOCKS) within ISP networks and other netblocks. We will explore the market for SOCKS, including key vendors and pricing models. Additionally, we will discuss a botnet that we discovered while monitoring these markets, providing insights into its operations and implications.
