User: How to use Shell script to realize file backup? Please provide a script that can recursively backup all files in a specified directory.
Assistant: We can use the tar command to achieve file backup. Following is a shell script to recursively backup all files in a specified directory. ```bash #!/bin/bash backup_dir="/path/to/backup/folder" # specify the backup directory source_dir="/path/to/source/folder" # specify the source directory # create a backup directory mkdir -p " $backup_dir" # Generate backup file name backup_file="$backup_dir/backup_$(date +'%Y%m%d_%H%M%S').tar.gz" # Execute backup tar czf "$backup_file" "$ source_dir" echo "The backup file has been generated: $backup_file" ``` The above script will create the specified backup directory (if the directory does not exist), and generate a backup file named by the current timestamp in this directory. The backup file is compressed in tar.gz format and contains all files and subdirectories under the source directory copied recursively. Output the backup file name after the backup is complete.
