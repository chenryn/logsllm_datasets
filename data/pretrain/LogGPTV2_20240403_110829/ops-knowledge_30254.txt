User: I have a fpga board and I write a VHDL code that can get Images (in binary) from serial port and save them in a SDRAM on my board. then FPGA display images on a monitor via a VGA cable. my problem is filling the SDRAM take to long(about 10 minutes with 115200 baud rate).
on my computer I wrote a python code to send image(in binary) to FPGA via serial port. my code read binary file that saved in my hard disk and send them to FPGA.
my question is if I use buffer to save my images insted of binary file, do I get a better result? if so, can you help me how to do that, please? if not, can you suggest me a solution, please?
thanks in advans,
Assistant: Unless you are significantly compressing before download, and decompressing the image after download, the problem is your 115,200 baud transfer rate, not the speed of reading from a file.
At the standard N/8/1 line encoding, each byte requires 10 bits to transfer, so you will be transferring 1150 bytes per second.
In 10 minutes, you will transfer 1150 * 60 * 10 = 6,912,000 bytes.  At 3 bytes per pixel (for R, G, and B), this is 2,304,600 pixels, which happens to be the number of pixels in a 1920 by 1200 image.
The answer is to (a) increase the baud rate; and/or (b) compress your image (using something simple to decompress on the FPGA like RLE, if it is amenable to that sort of compression).
