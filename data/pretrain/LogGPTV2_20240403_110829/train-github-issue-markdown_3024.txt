Subject: Issue with Wildcard Queries on .kibana Indices in Elasticsearch 1.4.4

Hi,

I have encountered an issue while attempting to execute wildcard queries against the `.kibana` indices in Elasticsearch version 1.4.4, specifically when querying the `_id` field. I observed that prefix queries work as expected, but wildcard queries do not return any results.

Here are the examples for reference:

### Prefix Query (Working)
```bash
curl -X GET "localhost:9200/.kibana/_search?pretty" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'
{
  "query": {
    "prefix": {
      "_id": "TC"
    }
  }
}'
```
This query successfully returns the expected results.

### Wildcard Query (Not Working)
```bash
curl -X GET "localhost:9200/.kibana/_search?pretty" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'
{
  "query": {
    "wildcard": {
      "_id": "TC*"
    }
  }
}'
```
However, this wildcard query returns an empty result set.

Could you please provide some guidance or insights into why the wildcard query might not be working and how to resolve this issue?

Thank you,
