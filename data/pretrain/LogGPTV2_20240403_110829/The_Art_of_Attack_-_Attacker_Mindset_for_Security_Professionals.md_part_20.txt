Undoubtedly, there is an element of opportunity that shows
up in every attack, but the art of an attack is still formula- and
skill- based.
Attack Strategy 175
Attacks in Action
Attacking is defined as engaging your opposition with your objec-
tive in mind. Some of the art of attacking relies on engaging and
deceiving your opposition with the objective in mind—k eeping
them in the dark about the facts that are indeed part of an active
attack. Offensively, an ethical attacker (EA) takes on the role of the
adversary, and ultimately the most cost- efficient way to perform
an attack is under the radar and with as little resistance as possi-
ble from the opposition. Concealing your identity as an attacker is
always prudent, though not always as easy as you might first think.
It’s important to know your pretext, and ensure that it gets you all
the way to your objective or that there is an opportunity to pivot into
a new pretext once inside.
Remember that the third law of AMs is never to break pretext.
That essentially means you are never yourself. You can draw on
multiple pretexts in one engagement, but they must have a pur-
pose. For example, if your job is to get to the bank’s vaults, you will
need a finely crafted pretext to get you from the entry point to the
vault. The best- case scenario is that you’ve had time and permission
to perform vishing and phishing attacks, gaining enough details to
know how to facilitate a good pretext for that endeavor. However,
that might not all be within scope. If it is not, then you must be
able to come up with an agile pretext. You will have to infer where
needed and adapt where possible. Your offensive attacker mind-
sets (OAMs) will fight to overtake your defensive attacker mindsets
(DAMs) in this situation. You must overcome this urge in part. Your
DAMs will allow you to look at the risks your OAMs will not care
about in the moment.
There will also be times when your pretext will slightly alter
depending on who you are speaking to. If you have been tasked
with getting into a bank’s vaults, you may enter the bank as an
auditor, which may be enough to get to into the perimeter, but the
deeper you get into the building and its defenses, the more layers
176 TOOLS AND ANATOMY
you may need. When you reach the bank’s vaults, you will, in all
likelihood, not get into them as an auditor. If you cannot tailgate in
or brute- force your way in with tools, you may have to pivot and ask
for assistance as a fellow employee.
Opportunities that arise in the course of an engagement make a
one- track offensive strategy impossible. In fact, sometimes pivoting
becomes the offensive strategy. There are two ways to pivot: there’s
a single person adjusting and adapting the deeper they get into their
target environment, and there’s team pivoting, which is like a team
of baton runners doing a hand- off. In the latter case, there may be
less flexibility when advancing to the next stage of an attack if it
is contingent on one attacker within a group. For example, if one
attacker from the team needs to get into the building in order to let
another in from an alternative entrance point, then more rigidity is
introduced to the setup.
This was the case for me on a recent job. I was to gain entry
to one of multiple buildings and test the visitor system. My team-
mate and I coordinated as I walked through the building, entering
from a far- off alternative entrance. Initially I tried to let my team-
mate in the side door of the cafeteria, but there was a locked gate
that prohibited him from getting to it. He could have jumped the
gate, but law 4 prevented it. In broad daylight, jumping a gate in a
busy professional complex would’ve stood out. Note that the build-
ing was glass on three sides, and the crowded cafeteria looked out
onto the gate.
Our plan failed there, so it was on to the next plan. I soon made
my way to reception and ultimately signed my teammate in as my
guest. It has been one of the few times I have used an authoritative
approach on a target. As I approached the reception desk from the
side, I waved to my teammate and ordered the desk receptionist to
sign him in without much in the way of amiability. I made a point
of being brisk with her and yet friendly with him from the other
side of the barrier I was trying to remove. It worked. I used all the
laws in one moment and they paid off.
We used the same tactic to enter another of the buildings the
next day. Two of my teammates made their way to stand with a small
Attack Strategy 177
crowd of actual employees waiting for service at the food truck in
the parking lot. They then nonchalantly walked back in with some
people from the crowd, effectively tailgating into the building. Mak-
ing their way from the back of it to the front, they greeted me and
one other team member, again asking a receptionist to grant us entry
via the visitor system. Ultimately, and sadly for us, this maneuver got
us caught. We got a little cocky and greedy.
We didn’t actually have to enter this building since we’d com-
promised all the others within the scope. But we also had nothing
to lose by that point because we were hours from calling the job
to a stop. After around 15 minutes in the building, taking photos
and collecting sensitive information from desks, as was the objec-
tive of that operation, we were escorted out by security. The woman
who had let us in didn’t fully buy all the way into our scam, and
in the end, she alerted security and her bosses. We did not adhere
to law 4 here. It was on me, too; I was adamant we could get into
that building.
As you can see, a misallocation of the economy of force can
increase the complexity of a job. However, it’s a fine line to tread;
in trying to employ all available combat power in the most effective
way possible, you can inadvertently create rigidity and extra work
for all. In cases where you cannot enter and remain alone, remain-
ing frill-f ree is vital. The offensive mentality of the team’s AMs must
outperform the best or most successful attackers alone; otherwise,
too many variables are introduced.
Strategic Environment
The strategic environment that you enter as you perform attacks
remains as it has always been— complex. In the book Foundations
of Homeland Security: Law and Policy by Martin J. Alperen (pp.55-
78), the strategic environment insofar as a military definition is
described as “a broad range of strategic factors that influence an
understanding of the operational environment. . . .” For you as an
attacker, strategic factors in your operational environment include
178 TOOLS AND ANATOMY
a wide range of people inside the target environment, as well as the
security protocols it has in place and the location.
Beginning with the people part, you will run into three types
of people in your target environment: lucrative, neutral, and oppo-
nent. In and of itself, this is not cause for concern if you can eas-
ily identify people within their category. However, more often than
not categorization will not be possible until you’ve had that initial
interaction and you are left to either steer the interaction to your
benefit or be a subject of its outcome. So, for example, you might
walk by 10 people sitting in their cubicles with their heads down
or walk by one security guard who doesn’t look up; these two fall
under neutral and lucrative, respectively. However, you might inter-
act with someone you hoped would turn out to be in the lucrative
category but immediately begins to challenge you, moving them to
the opponent category.
Moreover, these three cohorts will interact in an uncoordinated
manner to produce a complex environment for you to navigate. And
so, because of this complexity, you must be able to employ a certain
amount of mental agility in your approach, either by gently steering
the conversation and outcome or by employing chameleon tactics
and reacting to any targets you come into contact with in a way that
seems favorable to them. This takes quite a lot of AMs’s bandwidth,
as you will have to subtly adapt to interaction with a target in order
to advance. To do so, you will have to read them correctly, which
takes a certain amount of active engagement. It’s done through
information processing, mental agility, and self-a wareness. If you
can read them, you can adjust in a beneficial way, but you will need
accurate self- awareness. The strategic environment thought of this
way presents broad challenges. But there are concepts that can con-
trol the use of your AMs to meet the demands of the environment,
the most important of which is strategic agility.
Strategic agility is the timely application and sustainment of
your AMs, and at a speed and tempo that your adversaries cannot
match. In other words, you must always aim to be ahead of your tar-
gets; you must always be preemptively assuming their next move.
Being faster than your opponent doesn’t mean always accurately
Attack Strategy 179
predicting the future. It can mean steering the present to create the
future. Typically, people do what you expect them to do. A secu-
rity guard will try to stop an obvious intruder, which is great if you
have a team member to spare as a distraction— in this case, you’re
already ahead of your opponent.
In network pentesting, if you are noticed, the incident responders
work to take the impacted applications or systems off the network.
They will also check for backdoors or block associated accounts.
Your targets may know how to stop one style of attack, but your
AMs allows you to see what is invisible to them and to exploit those
unknown (to them) variables. This is attacker agility, and it creates
opportunity and momentum in the moment from target reaction,
which takes definite social skill. Attacker agility is an important
skill that will help you combat the uncertainty you face given
the three types of people you will come across. Offensive strategy
allows an attacker to see vulnerabilities and valuables invisible to
the organization and exploit them in plain sight, such as the visitor
system, which is any process that helps an organization keep track
of the people that visit their location. Some businesses and build-
ings simply collect the visitor’s name, but others have higher secu-
rity standards, such as badges, legal documents, employee escorts,
and sign-i n systems.
The Necessity of Engagement and Winning
As an EA, you advance the fundamental and enduring security
needs— the protection of livelihoods, information, and data— of
businesses, institutions, and governments. Effectively, your goal
is always to enhance security. You are an instrument for ensuring
it. Accordingly, the primary purpose of an EA is to deter threats
against an organization and its interests, and to help them defeat
such threats should deterrence fail, by empowering them with
awareness of what an attack looks and feels like. As an attacker you
stand with the other instruments wielded by these organizations—
typically technology which can be a deterrent.
180 TOOLS AND ANATOMY
Deterrence via technology focuses on forcing bad actors to con-
sider the costs of doing attacking, as well as the consequences that
might come from a counterattack. There are two main principles
of deterrence typically at play. The first is denial, which (hopefully)
results in bad actors being convinced that they won’t succeed, at
least not without enormous effort and cost. The second principle at
play is punishment, which focuses on making the bad actors believe
that there will be a strong response with serious consequences.
Of course, deterrence doesn’t always work. Threats such as
those posed by nation- states. Some criminals are simply not afraid
of the law or consequences and often are affected by other mitigat-
ing factors such as greed or abject behavior tendencies.
As an attacker, your immediate task is to attack and win against
a client. To do so well, you will have to be well organized, trained,
equipped, and work against the deterrence in place and note where
there none. However, attacking to win isn’t your overarching goal.
Ethical attacking is a structured process that seeks to better under-
stand the capabilities of an organization to secure itself against
malicious threats. It’s safer to do this process through simulations
rather than waiting for the real thing to occur. You test defenses and
identify blind spots in the hopes of hardening your client’s defenses.
Winning at all costs doesn’t teach an organization. Sure, you could
scale the building, use a glass cutter, and escape down the trash
chute from the 20th floor, but that’s really the absolute last sequence
you should try; otherwise, you leave them vulnerable because the
least resource- intensive, least costly ways are left open— visible to
malicious attackers, invisible to the future victims of them.
Certainly, there are some jobs where you will have to resort to
extreme measures; the higher and more advanced a business’s secu-
rity, the more advanced your attack will have to be. In any case,
your job is to attack and identify vulnerabilities that are invisible
to the client but that put them in grave danger. The EA’s job exists
because of the necessity of engagement.
The essential nature of engagement lies in its ability to enhance
security through integrated approaches, such as network and physi-
cal pentesting as well as awareness. This allows organizations to
Attack Strategy 181
structure their environments, deal with the full spectrum of threats,
and prepare for an unclear and ever- changing future. By using all
tools and tests that are essentially instruments of destruction, includ-
ing physical and network-b ased engagements, as ways to strengthen
security, one-b y- one the national landscape is made less penetrable.
Ethical attackers play the key role in this effort. As an EA able to
think maliciously but not become hostile, you form the foundation
of mutually beneficial alliances and security partnerships, bolster-
ing security stability in the long run for the organization you serve.
But perhaps more importantly, you bolster and stabilize the security
of their customers, which are typically the public, our families,
communities, and the wider socio- ecological networks. Short-t erm
malicious activity for the greater good makes the world safer for
everyone, and in any attack strategy, there are asymmetric dangers.
Thankfully, as an attacker with an offensive strategy, they are often
to your benefit.
As an EA doing what is necessary, you will often resort to asym-
metric means to counter the target’s defenses. This might include
unconventional approaches that circumvent a target’s strengths,
exploit their vulnerabilities, or confront them in ways they cannot
match. For example, a target environment’s location can severely
go against them— if they are the only buildings on a street, then
waiting until everyone is home for the night and entering (scope
permitting) is probably a good idea. If your target is located on an
extremely busy street, diverting and (mis)directing traffic can be of
great use if you have to lock pick your way in. You should look at
how adjacent neighborhoods are connected, ensuring that you can
take the most efficient low-k ey routes as it’s valuable information
for your client. Surrounding landscape is a huge variable in how
adversaries pick and execute attacks. Robbing a bank in New York
would be easier due primarily to a lack of aerial views— deep “can-
yons” created by the tall buildings make getting away a little more
likely than in say, London, where there aren’t huge skyscrapers lin-
ing every street. Now, I am not condoning robbing banks anywhere,
but this is how criminals and other adversaries think. They look at
the whole, and so should we.
182 TOOLS AND ANATOMY
Circumventing a target’s strengths and exploiting their vulner-
abilities extends to network attacks, too. Let’s say your target com-
pany has a bring- your- own- device (BYOD) policy in place. Targets
have the freedom to choose whatever device they want to work
with, which makes the process of keeping track of vulnerabilities
and updates considerably harder for system administrators. It also
makes being prepared for an array of potential malware attacks on
different devices quite difficult.
An average hacker can make quick work of creating a hotspot
to trick targets into connecting. If credentials are available to them
on the connecting device, there’s no reason they couldn’t soon find
themselves on the target network. Viruses are also a big problem
when implementing BYOD strategies because potential targets
can access sites or download mobile apps that would otherwise be
restricted.
We have discussed information weaponization in a few chap-
ters, but touching upon it now seems prudent as giving out infor-
mation is most often a function of something most businesses need
to do: A company must be able to market itself and perform its core
functions; if these are inherently vulnerable, you are at an unfair
advantage as an attacker. In other cases, the media will report infor-
mation for general consumption that, with AMs applied, results
in the identification or creation of a vulnerability. For example,
I was able to enter that bank’s Manhattan headquarters by piec-
ing together information from the items placed in news articles and
inference via off-t he- cuff comments made by top-r anking employ-
ees on social media and in articles.
These sorts of risks have the potential to threaten most organi-
zations directly, and it is important to use this against them so that
they are no longer blind to seemingly innocuous information’s
potential for weaponization. Other challenges your targets gener-
ally face are things like denying them access to their own assets and
owning their defenses, rendering them useless. Your target’s envi-
ronment is best protected through deterrence. For this to happen
effectively, you illuminate what must be deterred.

The Attack Surface
Every attack surface varies slightly. But generally speaking, the
attack surface is the full and integrated area of an organization
(or system) that is susceptible to attacks. It is everything from the
boundary of a system, some element of the system, or environment
where an attacker can attempt entry. It includes all systems, all
locations, all physical and digital assets, and for us, as attackers,
everyday information about the company/operation.
For every defense a company or system has in place, like infra-
structure, network security, endpoint security, building location, asset
location, physical security, surveillance, human resources, policy
