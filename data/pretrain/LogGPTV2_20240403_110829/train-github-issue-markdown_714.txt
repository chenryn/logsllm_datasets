**Migrated Issue, Originally Created by Praveen Arimbrathodiyil (@pravi)**

While packaging gnukhata (gnukhata.org) for Debian, I encountered the following error:

```python
File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/gnukhataserver/rpc_reports.py", line 134, in xmlrpc_getLedger
    grandTotal = float(balanceRow["total_CrBal"]) + float(balanceRow["curbal"])
File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/sqlalchemy/engine/result.py", line 332, in _key_fallback
    expression._string_or_unprintable(key)
sqlalchemy.exc.NoSuchColumnError: "Could not locate column in row for column 'total_CrBal'"
```

Additionally, the error triggers an `org.apache.xmlrpc.XmlRpcException`.

Krishnakant Mane, a core developer of gnukhata, confirmed that the application works correctly with SQLAlchemy 0.7.x. However, Debian Sid currently includes SQLAlchemy 0.9.6, which causes this issue.

He also mentioned that you had promised to fix this in the next release. We hope to receive a patch soon so that the Debian and Ubuntu packages can be updated. Currently, we are forced to create a separate repository and use the 0.7.x version of SQLAlchemy.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.
