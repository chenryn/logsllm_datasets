I'm packaging gnukhata (gnukhata.org) for debian and hit this error.
Krishnakant Mane (core developer of gnukhata) said everything is working fine
with sqlalchemy 0.7.x. Debian sid has sqlalchemy 0.9.6. He also mentioned you
have promised this would be fixed in the next release. Hopefully we can get a
patch sooner so it debian and ubuntu packages can be updated. Currently we are
forced to create a different repository and ship 0.7.x version of sqlalchemy.
