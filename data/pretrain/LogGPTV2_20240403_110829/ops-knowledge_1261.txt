User: Define what is load balancing, list common load balancing algorithms and describe their advantages and disadvantages.
Assistant: Load balancing is a technology that distributes the workload among multiple resources by distributing the workload in the network or system. Common load balancing algorithms are: 1. Round Robin: distribute requests to each server in turn, and distribute the load evenly. The advantage is that it is simple and easy to implement, but when a problem occurs on a certain server, it may have an impact on the entire system. 2. Least Connections: Allocate requests to the server with the least number of connections to achieve load balancing. The advantage is that it has good adaptability to the number of connections that change in real time, but if the processing speed of each server is different, it will lead to unbalanced load distribution. 3. IP hash method (IP Hash): By hashing the source IP of each request, and assigning it to the corresponding server. The advantage is that load balancing can adapt when requests change, but when request IPs are distributed centrally, it may cause server load imbalance. 4. Weighted Round Robin: Assign weights according to the processing capabilities of servers, and assign requests to servers with high weights. The advantage is that load balancing can be controlled more flexibly, but accurate evaluation of the processing capabilities of each server is required. 5. Random method (Random): Randomly assign requests to each server. The advantage is that it is simple and easy to implement, but the same as the polling method, when a problem occurs on a server, it may have an impact on the entire system. These load balancing algorithms have their own advantages and disadvantages, and the appropriate algorithm should be selected according to the system requirements and load conditions.
