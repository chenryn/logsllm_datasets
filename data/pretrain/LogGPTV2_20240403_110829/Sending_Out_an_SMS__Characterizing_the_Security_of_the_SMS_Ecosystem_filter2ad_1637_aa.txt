Abstract—Text messages sent via the Short Message Service
(SMS) have revolutionized interpersonal communication. Recent
years have also seen this service become a critical component of
the security infrastructure, assisting with tasks including identity
veriﬁcation and second-factor authentication. At the same time,
this messaging infrastructure has become dramatically more open
and connected to public networks than ever before. However, the
implications of this openness, the security practices of benign
services, and the malicious misuse of this ecosystem are not well
understood. In this paper, we provide the ﬁrst longitudinal study
to answer these questions, analyzing nearly 400,000 text messages
sent to public online SMS gateways over the course of 14 months.
From this data, we are able to identify not only a range of services
sending extremely sensitive plaintext data and implementing low
entropy solutions for one-use codes, but also offer insights into
the prevalence of SMS spam and behaviors indicating that public
gateways are primarily used for evading account creation policies
that require veriﬁed phone numbers. This latter ﬁnding has
signiﬁcant implications for research combatting phone-veriﬁed
account fraud and demonstrates that such evasion will continue
to be difﬁcult to detect and prevent.
I. INTRODUCTION
Text messaging has become an integral part of modern
communications. First deployed in the late 1990s, the Short
Messaging Service (SMS) now delivers upwards of 4.2 trillion
messages around the world each year [70]. Because of its
ubiquity and its perception as providing a secondary channel
bound tightly to a user’s identity, a range of organizations
have implemented security infrastructure that take advantage
of SMS in the form of one-time codes for two-factor authen-
tication [10], [26], [36] and account validation [73].
The text messaging ecosystem has evolved dramatically
since its inception, and now includes a much wider range of
participants and channels by which messages are delivered
to phones. Whereas phone numbers once indicated a speciﬁc
mobile device as an endpoint and were costly to acquire, text
messages may now pass through a range of different domains
that never touch a cellular network before being delivered to a
non-cellular endpoint. Moreover, these systems allow users to
send and receive messages for free or low cost using numbers
not necessarily tied to a mobile device, speciﬁc geographic
area or even a single customer. As such, they violate many of
the assumptions upon which the previously mentioned security
services were founded.
In this paper, we perform the ﬁrst longitudinal security
study of the modern text messaging ecosystem. Because of
the public nature of many SMS gateways (i.e., messages are
simply posted to their websites), we are able to gain signiﬁcant
insight into how a broad range of companies are implementing
SMS-based security services. Moreover, these systems allow
us to see the ways in which defenses such as phone-veriﬁed
accounts (PVAs) are successfully being circumvented in the
wild. Our work makes the following contributions:
• Largest Public Analysis of SMS Data: While others
have looked at aspects of SMS security in the past [37],
[38], ours is the largest and longest study to date. Our
analysis tracks over 400 phone numbers in 28 countries
over the course of 14 months, resulting in a dataset
of 386,327 messages. This dataset, which is orders of
magnitude larger than any previous study of SMS, allows
us to reason about the messaging ecosystem as a whole,
which has not been possible in previous public studies.
• Evaluation of Security Posture of Benign Services:
We observe how a range of popular services use SMS as
part of their security architecture. While we ﬁnd many
services that attempt to operate in a secure fashion, we
identify a surprising number of other services that send
sensitive information in the clear (e.g., credit card num-
bers and passwords), include identifying information, and
use low entropy numbers for their one-use codes. Because
there is no guarantee that this channel is indeed separate,
such observations create the potential for attacks.
• Characterization of Malicious Behavior via SMS
Gateways: We cluster and characterize the lifetime, vol-
ume and content of the trafﬁc seen in SMS gateways.
Our analysis uncovers numerous malicious behaviors,
including bulk spam and phishing. Most critically, our
data shows that these systems are being used to support
phone-veriﬁed account fraud, and the ways in which
these systems are used makes proposed mitigations from
previous work [72] largely ineffective.
We note the very fact
that some users are willing to
intentionally direct text messages to public portals is obviously
dangerous. We do not address this phenomenon and instead
focus on the risks of compromise of the SMS channel. Because
these messages are known by the recipient to be publicly
available, this dataset would naturally not be entirely repre-
sentative of all SMS activity of a typical user. Nevertheless,
this dataset enables the ﬁrst public insights into issues such

non-traditional carriers, ESME gateways and resellers, and OTT services. This evolution challenges old assumptions (e.g.,

legitimate services. Furthermore, this data is widely available
to the community for continued evaluation and measurement
in the future.

II. THE MODERN SMS ECOSYSTEM
In this section, we describe at a high level how text messages
are sent and received, with a special emphasis on recent
developments that have greatly expanded the SMS ecosystem.
Figure 1 shows the components of the modern SMS ecosys-
tem in detail. Short Messaging Service Centers (SMSCs) route
messages through carrier networks and are the heart of the
SMS system [79]. These entities receive inbound text messages
and handle delivery of these messages to mobile users in the
network using a store-and-forward regime similar to email.
When a mobile device sends or receives a text message, the
message is encrypted between the phone and the base station
serving the phone; however, once inside the core network the
message is typically not encrypted.
Text messages 1 are not just sent between individuals, but
also by parties external to the network known as External
Short Message Entities (ESMEs). ESMEs form an entire
industry dedicated to facilitating the sending and receiving of
messages for large-scale organizations for purposes as diverse
1In this paper, we use SMS and “text message” interchangeably.
as emergency alerts, donations to charities, or receiving one-
time passwords [76]. These ESMEs act as gatekeepers and
interfaces to SMS. Some have direct connections to SMSCs in
carrier networks via SMPP (Short Message Peer-to-Peer) [66],
while others resell such access purchased from other ESMEs.
For example, the VoIP carrier Bandwidth.com provides SMS
access to many third party services. Recently, startups like
Twilio [22], Nexmo [11], and Plivo [15] serve as ESMEs and
provide easy-to-deploy, low cost voice and SMS services. They
serve a number of high-proﬁle clients, including Uber, Coca
Cola, and eBay.
Just as the methods for SMS distribution have evolved over
the past two decades, how end users receive SMS has evolved
as well. Originally, SMS were only delivered to mobile phones
or to ESMEs. With the advent of smartphones, this ecosystem
is changing rapidly. Over-the-top networks like Burner [3],
Pinger [14], and Google Voice [6] provide SMS and voice
services over data networks (including cellular data as well
as Internet). Many of these services contract out
to third
party ESMEs for service and do not actually act as ESMEs
themselves. Additionally, messages that are delivered to a mo-
bile device may not remain restricted to that device. Systems
like Apple Continuity [1], Google Voice, Pushbullet [16], and
MightyText [9] use local wireless networks or cloud services
to store and sync SMS from the receiving device to the user’s
other devices. Millions of subscribers use these services to
transfer their messages from their localized mobile device to
be stored in the cloud.
The modern SMS ecosystem has the consequence from
a security perspective that a single SMS may be processed
by many different entities — not just carriers — who in
toto present a broad attack surface. Attacks against
these
systems may be technical in nature and take a form similar
to publicized data breaches [52]–[54], [80]. While to date

there are no disclosed attacks against these SMS services,
we note that
there is precedent for inﬁltration of carrier
networks [81]. Social engineering attacks are also possible.
Mobile Transaction Authentication Numbers (mTANs)2 have
been stolen using SIM Swap attacks [74] where an attacker
impersonates the victim to a carrier to receive a SIM card
for the victim’s account, allowing the attacker to intercept
security-sensitive messages. Attackers have also compromised
accounts protected by one-time-passwords delivered over SMS
by impersonating the victim to set up number forwarding to
an attacker-controlled device [30]. Accordingly, it is worth
determining what kinds of data are being sent via SMS so that
the consequences of future compromise are well understood.
This work measures how different entities implement secu-
rity mechanisms via text messages through the use of public
SMS gateways. As such, we are able to observe a wide array of
services and their behavior through time. Additionally, because
these gateways provide phone numbers to anonymous users,
we are also able to measure the extent to which such gateways
are being used for malicious purposes. This combined mea-
surement will help to provide the research community with
a more accurate and informed picture of the security of this
space.
III. METHODOLOGY
In this section, we describe the origins of our dataset,
discuss some limitations of this dataset, discuss supplementary
sources that give us additional insights into our SMS dataset,
and ﬁnally describe the techniques we use to extract meaning-
ful information from this dataset.
A. Public Gateways
In the previous section we noted that there are a number
of organizations that process text messages, including carri-
ers, ESMEs, resellers, and value-added services like message
syncing. Within the category of ESMEs lie a niche class
of operator: public SMS gateways. Many third party entities
(including cellular carriers) provide external public interfaces
to send text messages (but not receive them). Example use
cases include the convenience of an email gateway or the
ability to use a web service to send a message to a friend
after one’s mobile phone battery dies.
2mTANs are used to authenticate mobile banking transactions via SMS in
many countries, including Germany, South Africa, and Russia.
While there are many public services for sending messages,
they also have counterparts in public websites that allow
anyone to receive a text message online. These systems
publish telephone numbers that can receive text messages,
and when a text message arrives at that number the web
site publicly publishes the text message. These services are
completely open — they require no registration or login, and
it is clear to all users that any message sent to the gateway is
publicly available. We recognized the research value of these
messages for the potential to inform a data-driven analysis,
and collected them over a 14 month period from 8 distinct
public gateways that facilitate the receiving of text messages3,
listed in Table I. These gateways have similar names that
are potentially confusing, so where appropriate we reference
them by an assigned number 1—8 based on message volume.
Despite their similar names, most of these services appear to
be unafﬁliated, and each has distinct hosting infrastructure.
Gateways 4, 5, and 7 share 21 phone numbers, indicating a
likely relationship between these gateways.
These different services have essentially the same func-
tionality, but advertise their intended use in different ways.
For example, Gateway 2 claims to be “useful if you want
to protect your privacy by keeping your real phone number
away from spammers,” while Gateway 4 instructs users to
“Enter the number where you want verify [sic] like Gmail,
Yahoo, Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon, VK etc.” Gateway 7
has perhaps the most speciﬁc use case: “When your ex-wife
wants to send you a text message.” Gateway 4 indicates that
they expect users to use their service for account veriﬁcation,
while Gateways 2 and 7 simply advertise themselves as privacy
services. We suspect that the business model of most of these
websites relies on advertising revenue, and this is conﬁrmed
by at least Gateway 2, which prominently displays “almost
all of [our income] comes from our online advertising” in a
banner requesting that users disable their ad blocker. However,
advertising is not the sole source of revenue for every system:
Gateways 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8 sell private numbers for receiving
SMS, while Gateways 4 and 5 actually sell veriﬁed Google
Voice and WhatsApp accounts.
a) Ethical Considerations: As researchers, our ultimate
goal is to improve the security practices of users and organi-
zations, but we must do so ethically. In particular, we should
make every effort to respect the users whose data we use in
our studies.
A superﬁcial ethical analysis would conclude that because
it is clear that all messages sent to these gateways are public,
and their use is strictly ”opt-in”, users have no reasonable
expectation of privacy in the collection and analysis of this
data. While we believe this analysis to be true, the situation
is more complex and requires further discussion, as there are
a number of parties to these messages. In addition to users
who knowingly provide a gateway number as their own phone
number, other individuals and institutions (companies, chari-
3Note that throughout the rest of the paper we use the term “gateway” to
refer exclusively to these receive-only SMS gateways.

ties, etc.) may send information to individuals, not knowing
that the messages are delivered to a public gateway. While
institutions rightfully have privacy rights and concerns, they
differ from those of individuals. As we show in our results,
the vast majority of the information that we collect is sent
indiscriminately and automatically by organizations to a large
number of recipients. This information is unlikely to contain
information that would negatively impact the institution if
disclosed. Although we study bulk institutional messages, we
do not analyze further those messages determined to be of
a strictly personal nature. While those messages may have
a research value, we deliberately avoid these messages to
prevent further propagating this data.
Nevertheless, the use of gateways absolutely creates conﬁ-
dentiality and privacy concerns. For example, when personally
identifying information (PII) or account credentials are sent
to a gateway (whether or not all parties are aware), the com-
promise of that information is immediate and irrevocable 4.
Because we do not make our data available to others, this study
does not change — in severity or duration — the harm done
by the existence and use of the gateway. Furthermore, while
in Section V-A we describe a host of sensitive information
found in the dataset, we do not publish, use, or otherwise take
advantage of this information. In particular, we especially do
not attempt to access accounts owned by gateway users or
operators.
We recognize that there are ethical questions raised not
just with the collection of this data, but also by combining
it with other data sources. Our data augmentation is sufﬁ-
