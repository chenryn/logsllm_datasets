## Abstract
Text messages sent via the Short Message Service (SMS) have transformed interpersonal communication and have become a critical component of security infrastructure, supporting tasks such as identity verification and second-factor authentication. The messaging infrastructure has also become more open and connected to public networks. However, the implications of this openness, the security practices of legitimate services, and the malicious misuse of the ecosystem are not well understood. In this paper, we present the first longitudinal study to address these questions, analyzing nearly 400,000 text messages sent to public online SMS gateways over 14 months. Our findings reveal that many services send extremely sensitive plaintext data and use low-entropy solutions for one-time codes. We also provide insights into the prevalence of SMS spam and behaviors indicating that public gateways are primarily used to evade account creation policies requiring verified phone numbers. This has significant implications for research combating phone-verified account fraud and demonstrates the ongoing challenges in detecting and preventing such evasion.

## 1. Introduction
Text messaging has become an integral part of modern communication. First deployed in the late 1990s, the Short Messaging Service (SMS) now delivers approximately 4.2 trillion messages globally each year [70]. Due to its ubiquity and perception as a secondary channel tightly bound to a userâ€™s identity, many organizations have implemented security infrastructure using SMS for one-time codes in two-factor authentication [10], [26], [36] and account validation [73].

The SMS ecosystem has evolved dramatically since its inception, now including a wider range of participants and channels for message delivery. Unlike traditional systems where phone numbers indicated specific mobile devices, modern SMS can pass through various domains without touching a cellular network before being delivered to non-cellular endpoints. These systems allow users to send and receive messages for free or at a low cost using numbers not necessarily tied to a mobile device, specific geographic area, or even a single customer, challenging the assumptions upon which previous security services were based.

In this paper, we conduct the first longitudinal security study of the modern text messaging ecosystem. By leveraging the public nature of many SMS gateways, we gain significant insights into how a broad range of companies implement SMS-based security services and how defenses like phone-verified accounts (PVAs) are circumvented. Our contributions include:

- **Largest Public Analysis of SMS Data:** Our study is the largest and longest to date, tracking over 400 phone numbers in 28 countries over 14 months, resulting in a dataset of 386,327 messages. This dataset allows us to reason about the messaging ecosystem as a whole, which was not possible in previous studies.
- **Evaluation of Security Posture of Benign Services:** We observe how popular services use SMS in their security architecture. While many services attempt to operate securely, we identify a surprising number that send sensitive information in plaintext, include identifying information, and use low-entropy numbers for one-time codes, creating potential attack vectors.
- **Characterization of Malicious Behavior via SMS Gateways:** We analyze the traffic seen in SMS gateways, uncovering numerous malicious behaviors, including bulk spam and phishing. Most critically, our data shows that these systems are used to support PVA fraud, making proposed mitigations from previous work largely ineffective.

We note that the fact that some users direct text messages to public portals is inherently dangerous. While our dataset is not entirely representative of all SMS activity, it provides the first public insights into issues such as PVA scams, SMS spam, and the transmission of sensitive information by legitimate services. This data is available to the community for further evaluation and measurement.

## 2. The Modern SMS Ecosystem
In this section, we describe the components and recent developments in the modern SMS ecosystem. Figure 1 illustrates the key components, including Short Messaging Service Centers (SMSCs) that route messages through carrier networks and External Short Message Entities (ESMEs) that facilitate large-scale message sending and receiving. ESMEs form an industry dedicated to emergency alerts, donations, and one-time passwords [76]. Some ESMEs have direct connections to SMSCs via SMPP (Short Message Peer-to-Peer) [66], while others resell access purchased from other ESMEs. Startups like Twilio [22], Nexmo [11], and Plivo [15] provide easy-to-deploy, low-cost voice and SMS services to high-profile clients.

The methods for SMS distribution and reception have evolved. Over-the-top (OTT) networks like Burner [3], Pinger [14], and Google Voice [6] provide SMS and voice services over data networks, often contracting out to third-party ESMEs. Additionally, systems like Apple Continuity [1], Google Voice, Pushbullet [16], and MightyText [9] use local wireless networks or cloud services to store and sync SMS across multiple devices.

From a security perspective, the modern SMS ecosystem presents a broad attack surface, with messages processed by multiple entities. While there are no disclosed attacks against these SMS services, there is precedent for infiltration of carrier networks [81]. Social engineering attacks, such as SIM Swap attacks [74] and number forwarding [30], have compromised accounts protected by SMS-based one-time passwords. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the types of data being sent via SMS to mitigate future risks.

## 3. Methodology
In this section, we describe the origins of our dataset, discuss its limitations, and outline the techniques used to extract meaningful information.

### A. Public Gateways
Public SMS gateways allow anyone to receive text messages online. These services publish telephone numbers that, when messaged, publicly display the text message. They require no registration or login, and users are aware that messages are publicly available. We collected data over 14 months from 8 distinct public gateways (Table I). Despite similar names, most services appear unaffiliated, with distinct hosting infrastructure. Gateway 4, 5, and 7 share 21 phone numbers, suggesting a relationship.

These gateways serve different purposes. For example, Gateway 2 aims to protect privacy by keeping real phone numbers away from spammers, while Gateway 4 is used for account verification. Gateway 7 has a unique use case: "When your ex-wife wants to send you a text message." Gateway 4 and 5 sell verified Google Voice and WhatsApp accounts.

#### Ethical Considerations
Our goal is to improve security practices ethically. While messages sent to these gateways are public and opt-in, ethical concerns arise for parties unaware that their messages are public. We do not analyze personal messages and do not publish, use, or take advantage of sensitive information found in the dataset. We recognize the ethical questions raised by combining this data with other sources and ensure that our data augmentation is sufficient to address these concerns.

## 4. Dataset Characterization
In this section, we characterize the dataset, providing an overview of the types of messages and the entities involved. Our analysis includes the volume, content, and patterns of messages, revealing the extent of sensitive information and malicious activities.

## 5. Legitimate Usage of SMS via Gateways
We examine the legitimate usage of SMS via public gateways, focusing on how organizations use SMS for security and communication. Our findings highlight both secure and insecure practices, emphasizing the need for better security measures.

## 6. Malicious Behaviors
We detail the malicious behaviors observed in our dataset, including spam, phishing, and the use of gateways to evade account creation policies. These behaviors have significant implications for the security of SMS-based systems and the effectiveness of current mitigation strategies.

## 7. Related Work
We compare our findings with previous research on SMS security, highlighting the unique contributions of our study and the gaps it addresses.

## 8. Conclusion
In conclusion, our study provides the first comprehensive analysis of the modern SMS ecosystem, revealing the security practices of legitimate services and the prevalence of malicious activities. Our findings have important implications for the design and implementation of SMS-based security measures and the ongoing efforts to combat phone-verified account fraud.
