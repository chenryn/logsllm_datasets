User: I am using the following setup:
client -> Nginx -> uWSGI -> Python app
The connection between the client and Nginx is persistent. I am aware that there is no support for persistent connection between Nginx and uWSGI.
Is there a way to pass the Nginx connection ID to uWSGI so I can differentiate between clients? I am trying to differentiate between clients with the following limitation: The client does not support cookies and I cannot modify the client code. The client posts some JSON to the same URL so modifying the URLs does not apply here.
Assistant: Two solutions come to mind:

Link client to IP address and/or other headers the client is sending;
Upon first connection create a session ID and change all the links on the page to /link/to/page?sid=%(sessionid)s. It's not very pretty but it works.
