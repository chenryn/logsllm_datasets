User: I have a file that I want to read. The file may at any time be overwritten by another process. I do not want to block that writing. I am prepared to manage corruption to the data that I read, but do not want my reading to be in any way change the behaviour of the writing process.
The process that is writing the file is a delphi program running locally on the server. It opens the file using fmCreate. fmCreate tries to open the file exclusively and fails if there are any other handles on the file.
I am reading the file from a python script that accesses the file remotely across our network.
I am interested in whether there is a solution, independent of whether it is supported by python or delphi. I want to know if there is any way of achieving this under windows without modifying the writing program.
Edit: To reiterate, this is not a duplicate. The other question was trying to get read access to a file that is being written to. I want to the writer to have access to a file that I have open for reading. These are different questions (although I fear the answer will be similar, that it can't be done.)
Assistant: You can setup a filter driver which can act in two ways: (1) modify the flags when the file is opened, and (2) it can capture the data when it's written to the file and save a copy of the data elsewhere. 
This approach is much more lightweight and efficient than volume shadow copy service, mentioned in comments, however it requires having a filter driver. There exist several drivers on the market (i.e. those are products which include a driver and let you write business logic in user mode) yet they are costly and can be an overkill in your case. Still, if you need the thing for private use only, contact me privately for a license for our CallbackFilter.
Update: if you want to let the writer open the file which has been already opened, then a filter which will modify flags when the file is being opened is your only option.
