User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Change DPI of one user using W2K3 Remote Desktop / Terminal Server In short: How do I increase the DPI of some (not all) of our customers connected to our RDP server?



We are running a W2K3 Terminal Server that our clients connect to to run our application.

One of our clients complains that all fonts / icons etc are too small. This user has a high DPI monitor. The DPI of the client OS (XP in this case) is not transferred to the server.

To make things worse (or more interesting) the Display properties dialog disables the Advanced button that you can use to change the DPI on normal clients.

Assistant: First of I really did not do much work here, I just found the following post and tested it. Everything works great.

You will find that through trial and error this guy made 3 .reg files that can be installed during a users session. One will give 96dpi, one gives 120dpi, and one gives 144dpi. As I said I ran it with admins and limited users and both worked just fine. The users will have to log off for the changes to take affect, but they will not effect anyone else, just that user. The zip file that contains the 3 .reg files is found at this link.
