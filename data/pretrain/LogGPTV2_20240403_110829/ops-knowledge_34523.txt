Prepare host inventory: When working with Ansible, you must tell Ansible which hosts it wants to perform tasks on. Hostnames and IP addresses can be specified in the Inventory file. 3. Set connection credentials: If you want to perform tasks on remote hosts, you need to provide Ansible with connection credentials, such as username and password or SSH private key. 4. Write Playbook: Playbook is the core file of Ansible, which contains the definition of maintenance tasks and their associated hosts or host groups. 5. Execute Playbook: Use the ansible-playbook command to specify the Playbook file to be executed. 6. Debugging Ansible: Before running the Playbook, it's a good idea to do some tests to make sure everything is set up correctly. You can use the ansible command and a few others to test connectivity and permissions. 7. Optimize Ansible: The best way to optimize Ansible is to use simple tasks, modules and commands. In addition to this, various Ansible modules and variables can be used to make tasks more clear and efficient. 8. Monitoring Ansible: Monitoring Ansible is the key to an efficient deployment. Various tools, logs, and reports are available to ensure that all tasks are completed and to record any errors or issues.
