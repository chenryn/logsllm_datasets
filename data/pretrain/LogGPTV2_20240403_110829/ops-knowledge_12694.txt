User: I'm on Mac OS X 10.7.1 (Lion). I just downloaded a fresh copy of Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers, and installed the Mercurial plugin. I get the following error message:

abort: couldn't find mercurial libraries in [...assorted Python directories...].

I do have Python 2.6.1 and 3.2.1 installed. I also have a directory System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7, which is on the list of places it looked for the Mercurial libraries. hg -y debuginstall gives me the same message.
What are these libraries named, where is Eclipse likely to have put them when I installed the plugin, and how do I tell Eclipse where they are (or where should I move them to)?
Thanks, Dave
Full error message follows:

Assistant: Nobody answered me, but I figured out the answer. Maybe it will help someone.
I finally realized that since 'hg -y debuginstall' at the command line was giving me the same error message, it wasn't an Eclipse problem at all (duh). Reinstalling a newer version of Mercurial solved the problem.
