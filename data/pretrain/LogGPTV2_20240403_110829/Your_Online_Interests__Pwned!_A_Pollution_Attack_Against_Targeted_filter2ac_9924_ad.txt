lisher webpage as well as the category used for pollution. Un-
like re-marketing pollution, the success of behavioral pollution is
not dependent on a relatively small number of speciﬁc campaigns.
Consequently, this makes it challenging for the fraudulent publisher
to predict the exact landing domains and number of behavioral ads
that will be served by the ad exchange.
Despite these sources of variability for re-marketing and behav-
ioral pollution, it is still feasible for the fraudulent publisher to sig-
niﬁcantly increase its ad revenue.
6. REVENUE ESTIMATION FOR LIVE
PUBLISHERS
In this section, we deploy the attack on live publisher websites
and estimate the revenue generated by the attack for these publish-
ers. Unlike the controlled publisher setting, there are a number
of factors like the hosted content, popularity of the website, and
ad preferences setup by the publisher that impact the ad revenue.
Figure 10: Distribution of the relative increase in the indexed CPM
across the 19 selected websites.
While it is not feasible to explain the speciﬁc factors that impacts
the publisher’s revenue, we seek to empirically measure the overall
impact of the pollution on the revenue of live publishers.
As described in Section 4.3, we select the top 19 most frequently
visited websites from the web traces that host DoubleClick ads as
the “fraudulent” publishers. When replaying the web traces, every
visit to one of these 19 domains is followed by visiting the proﬁle
polluter. We emulate these traces four times in parallel for the fol-
lowing four pollution conﬁgurations - without pollution, behavioral
pollution, re-marketing pollution, and hybrid (both) pollution using
the pollution content shown in Table 1. The revenue is estimated
using the CPM index [26] data reported by DoubleClick.
6.1 Aggregate CPM Index Change
Figure 10 shows the relative change in the CPM index for the
three pollution conﬁgurations across the 19 websites. Overall, we
ﬁnd that behavioral pollution is not as effective as re-marketing
based pollution; for almost 80% of the websites the change in the
indexed CPM is not signiﬁcant (± 5%). On the other hand, re-
marketing based pollution does signiﬁcantly and consistently in-
crease the relative indexed CPM; an increase of 4–120% for about
80% of the domains.
To better understand these distributions, Table 3 provides the
trafﬁc statistics along with the relative change of CPM index for the
top ﬁve and bottom ﬁve performing domains ordered by the CPM

index with hybrid pollution. Figure 9 shows the average indexed
CPM for the same 10 websites. We make a number of observations
from this data:
Website Ranking and Trafﬁc Patterns. Across the ﬁve best and
worst performing websites we do not observe any correlation be-
tween the website ranking or trafﬁc patterns with the revenue gen-
erated by either one of the three pollution conﬁgurations. This indi-
cates that our attack is able to deceive the ad exchange in targeting
high value ads even on websites that are ranked much lower or have
highly varying trafﬁc patterns.
Varying Performance of Behavioral Pollution. We observe that
behavioral pollution does not consistently increase the ad revenue
for the fraudulent publisher. Among the top ﬁve websites listed
in Table 3, bleacherreport.com, slideshare.net and thenation.com
yield a negative or very low increase in the average CPM index.
Looking into the logs, we ﬁnd that the behavioral pollution of the
emulated trafﬁc to these websites was ineffective. For example,
83% and 85% of the ads targeted on bleacherreport.com were from
a single advertiser, ford.com, before and after behavioral pollution,
respectively. Similarly, 100% and 93% of the ads on slideshare.net
were from academy.com before and after behavioral pollution, re-
spectively. On the other hand, re-marketing and hybrid pollution
for these domains was effective and led to a signiﬁcant increase
in ad revenue. This potentially indicates that these websites have
pre-sold their ad inventory and consequently behavioral pollution
was ineffective. However, re-marketing based pollution manages
to override this pre-sold ad inventory, potentially because of the
higher CPM and CPC costs associated with these ads.
Low Yield Re-marketing Pollution. As discussed in Section 5,
re-marketing based pollution leads to aggressive targeting of users
independent of their online proﬁle. However, we observe that for
newyorker.com, download.cnet.com, and reliancenetconnect.co.in
all three pollution conﬁgurations are ineffective. None of the three
domains received ads from the advertisers used for re-marketing
pollution even when users visiting other domains were targeted
with the re-marketing ads. Moreover, the behavioral pollution was
also ineffective for these domains. For example, on reliancenetcon-
nect.co.in, between 65%-73% of the ads targeted at users before
and after pollution (all three pollution types) were automobile re-
lated ads from domains like mazdausa.com, avis.com, budget.com
and driveamazda.com. This potentially indicates a scenario where
the publisher website is explicitly conﬁgured to only receive auto-
mobile related ads making the different pollution mechanisms in-
effective.

dexed CPM across the visitors of samanyoluhaber.com as a result
of the pollution attack.
6.2 Revenue Contribution Per User
Next, we seek to understand how individual users contribute to
the revenue of a fraudulent publisher. To this end, Figure 11 shows
the cumulative distribution of the relative change of the indexed
CPM for each of the 85 visitors of samanyoluhaber.com. The over-
all distribution is biased towards a positive increase in the indexed
CPM inﬂuencing the average value of the improvement in Table 3
for the samanyoluhaber.com. We observe a large variation in the
relative CPM index for all three pollution conﬁgurations; the rela-
tive indexed CPM can reduce by as much as ∼30% and increase by
up to 79%, 157% and 158% for behavioral, re-marketing and hy-
brid pollution, respectively. This wide range is expected as users’
online interests and browsing patterns vary, and this impacts the
extent to which higher-paying ads are targeted after pollution.
We observe that across the three pollution conﬁgurations the rel-
ative indexed CPM decreases for 17.1%, 22.7% and 5.3% of users
for behavioral, re-marketing and hybrid pollution. Looking into the
traces of these speciﬁc users, we observed that these users visit the
publisher webpage infrequently with a median of only 2 visits to
the publisher websites.
The proﬁle pollution attack signiﬁcantly increases the average
indexed CPM ( > 50%) for 22.4%, 22.6% and 70.6% of users for
behavioral, re-marketing and hybrid pollution, respectively. For
these users we observe the opposite trend; these users visit samany-
oluhaber.com frequently, with a median of 9.5 visit across all users.
This frequent visit pattern is ideal for the attack and enables the
fraudulent publisher to repeatedly pollute the user’s proﬁle for each
successive visit.

Overall, our results indicate that the preferences set by the pub-
lisher when signing up with the ad exchange have a direct impact
on the revenue generated by the proﬁle pollution attack. Despite
these preference, the pollution attack is lucrative and can indeed
increase the publishers’ revenue with an average of 2.34%, 29.62%
and 33.89% for the three pollution conﬁgurations. Furthermore,
this revenue increase is robust to diverse online proﬁles of users,
ranking of the publisher webpage, and varying visit patterns to the
publisher webpage.
7. COUNTERMEASURES
In this section we discuss countermeasures and best practices
that different entities in the ad ecosystem can adopt in order to mit-
igate or at least minimize the attack surface.
7.1 Publishers
Commonly, websites are not supposed to be framed within an-
other website as part of an iframe [12]. Therefore, using
X-Frame-Option or deploying a “frame-busting” method can
make it more difﬁcult for the polluter to abuse innocent websites for
the purpose of pollution fraud (other methods, such as pop-unders
can still be used, but are easier to detect).
7.2 Advertisers
Advertisers should protect their ad campaigns against pollution
attacks by targeting audiences that have very speciﬁc interests. This
effectively raises the bar for the polluter to ﬁnd relevant pollution
content impacting a large number of users. For example, ﬁnding
the appropriate pollution content for the category
Jobs & Education→Education→Distance Learning may be more
difﬁcult to compared to ﬁnding pollution content for Education.
Similarly, a re-marketing campaign that targets users with a spe-
ciﬁc ﬂow in the website, e.g., users who logged in, placed an item
in a cart but did not check out, is more difﬁcult to compromise
compared to targeting all users who visited the webpage of the ad-
vertiser. We note that the downside of such ﬁne-grained audience
targeting is that it may reduce the size of the target audience.
7.3 Ad Exchange and Ad Networks
Recent work, like ViceROI [22], aims to detect click spam by
comparing the revenue per user for a fraudulent publisher with a
baseline set of ethical publishers. While this approach is limited to
catching click spam, ad networks and ad exchances should deploy
similar approaches to detect impression fraud caused by anomalous
revenue changes in the fraudulent publisher’s ad revenue. Even-
though the attacker has control over his ad revenue through con-
ﬁguring the attack settings (e.g. pollution content, ad preference,
and amount of polluted users, etc.), the deployment of systems like
ViceROI could reduce the ad revenue generated from proﬁle pollu-
tion.
