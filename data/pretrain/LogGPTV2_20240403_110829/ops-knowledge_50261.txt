User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How to identify the Java program that is maliciously accessing my web site from many client addresses? For many years, my personal web site receives numerous pairs of hits that look like this, every day:

202.xx.xx.xx - - [22/Apr/2013:12:02:26 +0000] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 5923 "-" "Java/1.4.1_04"
202.xx.xx.xx - - [22/Apr/2013:12:02:27 +0000] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 5923 "-" "Java/1.4.1_04"


The only thing the requests have in common is the "GET / HTTP/1.1" query, the Java user agent, and the fact that they come in pairs. Forensic logs don't reveal any other distinguishing qualities. The Java versions vary all over the map, as do the source IP addresses. I suspect that someone very antisocial has coded a semi-popular Java app that pings my site in this way, just to annoy.

No matter what response I send (2xx, 3xx, 4xx, 5xx, responses with images, responses with a thousand nested &lt;div&gt;s, etc.) the behavior from the clients is identical. Some of the client IP's seem to be servers, while others are residential connections. An email campaign attempting to notify/query the holders of the more identifiable addresses did not produce any useful clues as to the identity of the application.

This abuse isn't exactly a strain on my servers, but it's annoying. How can I identify the Java program that is responsible?

Assistant: The "user agent" is a string sent by whoever connects to your system -- the antisocial individual. Therefore, you cannot really trust it. Which means that you cannot assume that this client really uses Java. Actually, if the Java version is "all over the map", then this is a strong indication that the client is not using Java. A real Java-based standard HTTP client will return the version of the employed JDK; 1.4.1_04 is really old, and might not work anymore with a recent operating system.

So my opinion is that you can strike out the "Java" keyword in your search. These requests are probably the works of a botnet which tries to spread; the infected machines send these HTTP requests in order to get some information on random Web servers (e.g. server software version), and they disguise as "Java requests" in order to avoid some poorly-configured firewalls and filters.

This is not done to annoy you. It actually annoys everybody. All publicly available servers will receive requests such as yours; replicating botnets just use random IP addresses, and you cannot evade randomness. I get some on my own server, too.
