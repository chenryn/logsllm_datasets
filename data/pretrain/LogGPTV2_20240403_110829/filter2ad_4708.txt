I. MOTIVATION AND OBJECTIVES 
Nanocomputing  and  related-enabling  technologies  hold 
the  promise  of  higher  performance  and 
lower  power 
consumption, as well as increased communication capabilities 
and  functionality.  In  addition  to  the  impact  on  today 
computerized systems, nanocomputing is an essential lever to 
foster the emerging cyberphysical system paradigm. However, 
the dependability and security of these unprecedentedly small 
devices,  of  their  deployment,  and  of  their  interconnection 
remain uncertain.  The main sources of concern are: 
•  Nanometer devices are expected to be highly sensitive 
to  process  variations.  The  guard-bands  used  today  for 
avoiding 
impact  of  such  variations  will  not 
represent  a  feasible  solution  in  the  future.  As  a 
consequence,  timing  errors  and  their  higher  frequency 
of occurrence have to be addressed. 
the 
•  New  and  intricate  failure  modes,  specific  to  new 
materials, are expected to raise serious challenges to the 
design and test engineers. 
•  Environment induced errors, such as single event upsets 
(SEU), are likely to occur more frequently than in the 
case of more conventional semiconductor devices. 
•  Design  of  hardware  architectures  encompassing

workshop,  from  DSN-2007  to  DSN-2010,  have  attracted 
the  attention  of  the  DSN  audience  to  the  importance  of 
these  topics.  For  instance,  the  program  of  the  DSN-2010 
edition  has  addressed  many  of  the  related  issues  via  a 
special session on massive statistical process variations and 
testing.  The  regular  contributions  were  presented  in  three 
sessions,  dealing  with  soft  errors  and  intermittent  faults, 
fault-tolerant  architectures  and  resilience,  and  robustness 
enhancement  and 
trust  management.  The  workshop 
concluded  with  a  lively  wrap-up  session  where  some 
further “Grand Challenges” in Dependable Nanocomputing 
were  identified.  The  attendance  was  significant,  even 
higher  than  previous  editions  of  the  workshop,  and 
included participants both from academia and industry. 
II. SCOPE AND TOPICS 
•  The  increased  complexity  of  the  systems  based  on 
nanotechnology  will  require  improved  computer  aided 
design  (CAD)  tools,  as  well  as  better  validation 
techniques. 
•  The  security  of  nanocomputing  systems  may  be 
targeting  new 
threatened  by  malicious  attacks 
vulnerable areas in the hardware. 
Hardware implemented fault tolerance features will be 
widely  employed  for  dealing  with  these  dependability 
issues. The use of error correcting codes, as well as space 
and time redundancy, is expected to significantly increase. 
Providing high dependability to the end users will require 
This  year  the  scope  of  the  workshop  is  Architecting, 
Designing,  Manufacturing,  and  Testing  Dependable 
Nanocomputing Systems, with special attention being paid 
to the following topical areas: 
•  Nanocomputing  architectures  for  high  dependability 
and energy-efficiency. 
•  Design,  validation,  and  manufacturing  techniques  for 
coping with increased complexity. 
•  Dependability  of  application-specific  nanocomputing 
architectures, including SoCs-NoCs. 
•  Failure  modes  and 
nanocomputers.

workshop  to  continue  the  debate  on  the  increasingly 
complex  issues  posed  by  nanocomputing,  as  well  as  the 
best solutions for providing highly dependable and secure 
systems and networks to the end-users.  
III. FORMAT OF THE WORKSHOP  
This year, we have received 15 submissions, originating 
from  9  countries:  Japan  (4),  China  (2),  Taiwan  (2), 
USA (2),  and  Austria,  Canada,  India,  Sweden,  The 
Netherlands, 1 each. Ten submissions were accepted by the 
program  committee  and  the  organizers.  These  papers  will 
appear in the workshop proceedings and IEEE Xplore.  
leader  of 
Similar  to  the  previous  editions  (from  DSN-2007  to 
DSN-2010),  the  workshop  will  consume  a  full  day. 
In Session 1, a brief introduction is opening the workshop, 
followed  by  a  set  of  three  papers  dealing  with  specific 
failure  modes.  Session  2  features  a  keynote  talk,  titled 
“Stochastic  Computing:  Embracing  Errors  in  Architecture 
and  Design  of  Processors  and  Applications”,  given  by 
Prof. Rakesh  Kumar, 
the  Programmable, 
Adaptable,  and  Scalable  Systems,  Architectures,  and 
Technologies Group at the University of Illinois at Urbana-
Champaign,  USA.  The  keynote  motivates  the  need  for 
accounting  for  process  variations  and  proposes  a  new 
design and operational paradigm in which processors may 
produce  only  stochastically  correct  results,  even  under 
nominal conditions. The session will also include a regular 
paper  addressing  time  redundancy  techniques.  The  other 
regular  papers  will  be  presented  in  two  subsequent 
sessions,  as 
follows.  Session 3  addresses  mitigation 
techniques.  Finally,  Session 4  deals  with  testing  and  fault 
injection; the session will end with a general discussion and 
the wrap up of the workshop.  
This  year,  the  DSN-2011  organizers  have  offered  all 
workshops authors to present a poster during a poster track 
running through the conference. This option was also open 
to high quality contributions that could not be accepted due 
to  time  constraints.  Several  posters  related  to  WDSN11 
will be presented. We anticipate that this opportunity will 
attract the attention of many conference attendees and that 
you  will  take  advantage  of  this  to  visit  the  WDSN11 
posters.  
We  expect  the  presentations  and  discussions  will 
contribute  to  achieving  a  more  realistic  balance  between 
the  hardware  and  software  dependability  issues.  Also,  the 
workshop  will  reinforce  the  DSN  community  in  the  field 
and,  we  hope,  will  attract  new  industry  participants.  We 
expect lively discussions to take place, as it was the case in 
the previous editions.
