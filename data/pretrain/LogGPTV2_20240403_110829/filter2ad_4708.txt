## I. Motivation and Objectives

Nanocomputing and related enabling technologies promise higher performance, lower power consumption, and increased communication capabilities and functionality. Beyond their impact on current computerized systems, nanocomputing is a crucial driver for the emerging cyber-physical system paradigm. However, the dependability and security of these extremely small devices, their deployment, and interconnection remain uncertain. The main concerns include:

- **Process Variations:** Nanometer devices are highly sensitive to process variations. Current guard-bands used to mitigate such variations may not be feasible in the future, leading to an increased frequency of timing errors.
- **New Failure Modes:** New and complex failure modes specific to new materials pose significant challenges for design and test engineers.
- **Environment-Induced Errors:** Single event upsets (SEUs) and other environment-induced errors are likely to occur more frequently compared to conventional semiconductor devices.
- **Resilient Hardware Architectures:** There is a need for hardware architectures that incorporate reliable, energy-efficient, and resilient techniques, including error recovery and reporting, to improve system manageability. Software solutions will play an increasingly important role in this context.
- **Parallel Processing Paradigms:** Improved parallel processing and programming paradigms are essential due to the advent of multicore processors and Network-on-Chip (NoC) architectures.

The previous four editions of the workshop, from DSN-2007 to DSN-2010, have highlighted the importance of these topics. For example, the DSN-2010 edition addressed many related issues through a special session on massive statistical process variations and testing. The regular contributions were presented in three sessions, covering soft errors and intermittent faults, fault-tolerant architectures and resilience, and robustness enhancement and trust management. The workshop concluded with a lively wrap-up session where further "Grand Challenges" in Dependable Nanocomputing were identified. Attendance was significant, with participants from both academia and industry.

## II. Scope and Topics

This year, the workshop focuses on the following areas:

- **Improved CAD Tools and Validation Techniques:** The increased complexity of systems based on nanotechnology requires better computer-aided design (CAD) tools and validation techniques.
- **Security Threats:** The security of nanocomputing systems may be threatened by malicious attacks targeting new vulnerable areas in the hardware.
- **Fault Tolerance Features:** Hardware-implemented fault tolerance features, such as error-correcting codes and space and time redundancy, will be widely employed to address these dependability issues.
- **High Dependability:** Providing high dependability to end users will require a balanced approach between hardware and software solutions.

Specific topical areas include:

- **Nanocomputing Architectures:** High-dependability and energy-efficient architectures.
- **Design and Manufacturing Techniques:** Techniques for coping with increased complexity.
- **Application-Specific Architectures:** Dependability of application-specific nanocomputing architectures, including SoCs and NoCs.
- **Failure Modes and Testing Issues:** Specific to nanocomputers.

Contributions related to these topics will continue the debate on the increasingly complex issues posed by nanocomputing and explore the best solutions for providing highly dependable and secure systems and networks to end-users.

## III. Format of the Workshop

This year, we received 15 submissions from 9 countries: Japan (4), China (2), Taiwan (2), USA (2), and one each from Austria, Canada, India, Sweden, and the Netherlands. Ten submissions were accepted by the program committee and organizers. These papers will appear in the workshop proceedings and IEEE Xplore.

Similar to previous editions (DSN-2007 to DSN-2010), the workshop will span a full day. The format includes:

- **Session 1:** A brief introduction followed by three papers on specific failure modes.
- **Session 2:** A keynote talk titled "Stochastic Computing: Embracing Errors in Architecture and Design of Processors and Applications" by Prof. Rakesh Kumar from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, USA. This session will also include a paper on time redundancy techniques.
- **Session 3:** Papers addressing mitigation techniques.
- **Session 4:** Papers on testing and fault injection, concluding with a general discussion and wrap-up of the workshop.

Additionally, the DSN-2011 organizers have offered all workshop authors the opportunity to present a poster during a poster track running through the conference. This option is also open to high-quality contributions that could not be accepted due to time constraints. Several posters related to WDSN11 will be presented, and we anticipate that this will attract the attention of many conference attendees.

We expect the presentations and discussions to contribute to a more realistic balance between hardware and software dependability issues. The workshop will also reinforce the DSN community in the field and, we hope, attract new industry participants. Lively discussions are anticipated, as in previous editions.

## IV. Acknowledgements and Invitation

The organizers would like to thank the program committee members for their hard work and dedication in providing insightful feedback to the authors and their support in setting up and organizing the workshop. We would also like to thank the DSN-2011 conference organizers, particularly the Conference Chair and the Workshop Chairs, for their support and encouraging feedback. Special thanks go to the publication chair for his flexibility and careful handling of the workshop papers.

We sincerely hope you will choose to attend the fifth edition of the workshop and actively participate. Your comments and suggestions will be highly appreciated!
