Research  on  software  reliability  has  been  active  for  several  decades  now  and  has  produced  massive  amount  of 
literature to explore new ideas, and system prototypes to experiment with the proposed ideas. Notwithstanding this 
proficiency,  only  in  a  few  instances  has  research  work  found  its  way  into  industrial  applications.  This  apparent 
uncoordination is exacerbated by the increasing need for quality and dependability guarantees in the more and more 
computerized modern world.  
The Workshop on Applied Software Reliability (WASR) is the first workshop dedicated to addressing the increasing 
gap  between  practitioners  and  researchers  involved  in  the  development  of  mission  critical,  software-intensive 
systems. The workshop will provide a forum for detailed exchange of ideas, techniques, and experiences with the 
goal of understanding the industry's trend towards fielding reliable applications and providing feedback on existing 
and potential approaches.  
This workshop will focus on exploring answers to key research questions, including:  
•  What are the reliability requirements of current and future applications?  
•  What are the important challenges and risks?  
•  What are the currently used approaches to address reliability issues in industrial applications and what is 
needed?  
•  What are the promising reliability solutions in a short-mid term time frame?  
•  What are the open research problems?  
Researchers  and  practitioners  from  academia,  industry,  and  the  government  are  welcome  and  encouraged  to 
participate. We are soliciting contributions in application areas including, but not limited to:  
•  Database applications  
•  Scientific applications  
•  Telecommunication applications  
• 
•  Embedded applications  
•  Space applications  
Internet applications
