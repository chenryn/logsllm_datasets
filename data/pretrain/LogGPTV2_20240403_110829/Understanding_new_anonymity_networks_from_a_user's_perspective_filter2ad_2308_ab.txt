cover the public IP address of the anonymity network’s exit
node. This allows us to study the exit node pattern, includ-
ing frequency and rotation patterns. We further leverage
these sites to measure Web latency since the sites have min-
imal content. To avoid placing unnecessary load on these
IP reporting sites, our automated polls access each site only
once every ﬁve minutes.
To measure the throughput of each anonymity system, we
timed the download of a 403KB ﬁle from a well-connected
university Web server. We performed this download once
every ﬁve minutes in hour-long sessions at times distributed
evenly throughout the day.
This approach allows us to examine the latency, band-
width, and exit node IP address diversity of each of the
three anonymity systems.
4. RESULTS
We now examine the reliability, performance, and address-
ing properties of each of the anonymity systems.
Reliability: The SurfEasy experiments were always com-
pleted successfully and Tor was also often fairly reliable.
However, JAP was far less reliable: it only worked properly
on about half of the PlanetLab nodes at any given time,
with intermittent failure for our testing nodes.
Network Performance: We show the latency results for
each of the three anonymity system for each of the three IP
address echo sites in Table 1, excluding time-outs (we used
a timeout of 60 seconds). These results are averages over
all accesses of each site for each system. We attempted 240
connections over about 20 hour-long sessions for the Tor and
JAP systems. However, the reliability issues with Tor and
JAP caused some probes to be unsuccessful. The SurfEasy
tests were also the result of over 200 access attempts. Sur-
fEasy had the lowest latency in most cases while Tor had
the highest. With such low latency, SurfEasy is unlikely to
implement a robust mixing architecture.
System Behavior In Table 2, we show the averages for the
number of unique IP addresses contacted by each system’s
client during connection setup, as well as the total number
of IP addresses contacted by the client while a connection

was maintained and used over a period of one hour. Tor
has a higher rotation of IPs than either JAP or SurfEasy.
SurfEasy does not seem to rotate IPs.
In fact, SurfEasy
appears to use only a single proxy server in each anonymous
connection. The reported IP address of the exit point is
identical to the address contacted by the client.
To conﬁrm our suspicions about SurfEasy’s single proxy
architecture, we performed latency tests targeting the Sur-
fEasy proxy from the source test node and a server we con-
trol. We then connected to the server we controlled from
the test node. We obtained average ping round trip times
of 30ms and 40ms from our university and residential test
sites, respectively. When we used the SurfEasy proxy to ac-
cess one system from the other, we had a minimum round
trip time of 149ms. The server thus had roughly 79ms for
any cryptographic and forwarding operations. Given the
network latencies we observed, we ﬁnd that this end-to-end
latency leaves little room for more than a simple proxy server
or mixed network under a single administrator’s control.
5. CONCLUSION
Our experiments show that SurfEasy currently oﬀers su-
perior Web browsing performance when compared to Tor
and Java Anon Proxy. In our testing, it is more reliable than
either of the Tor or Java Anon Proxy systems. The system
is still a new service and is under development. However,
it could only be tested from two locations in the same area
and it may behave diﬀerently in the future as they expand
the network.
While SurfEasy does oﬀer superior performance, the de-
gree of anonymity it oﬀers may be inferior to other mod-
ern approaches. We cannot determine the SurfEasy net-
work’s design with certainty; however, substantial evidence
suggests that it uses only single proxy, resembling the
Anonymizer system. A single proxy server is weak against
attacks and allows the proxy server operator to trivially
break a user’s anonymity.
