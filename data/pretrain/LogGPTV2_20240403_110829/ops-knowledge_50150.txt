User: I'm trying to get Python support in gVim on Windows. Is there a way to accomplish that?
I'm using:

Windows XP SP3
gVim v. 7.3
Python 2.7.13 (ActivePython through Windows Installer binaries)
Assistant: I had a similar problem. I've been enjoying vim's omni-completion feature for some years,using Windows XP, Python 2.7, gVim 7. Recently I moved to a new PC running Windows 8.1. I installed gVim and the plugins I like, then tried out everything. Omni-completion gave an error, saying I needed the version of vim compiled with Python support. At that stage, I had not yet installed Python. The solution was to install Python then re-install vim. Omni-conpletion now works. Perhaps the order of installation matters.
