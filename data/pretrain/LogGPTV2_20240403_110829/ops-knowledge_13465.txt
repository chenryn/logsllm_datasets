User: How to deploy web application using Docker? Please provide some basic tutorial steps.
Assistant: Here are the basic tutorial steps: 1. Install Docker: Install Docker on your computer or server. 2. Prepare your web application: Put your web application in a folder and create a Dockerfile to instruct Docker how to build your application. A Dockerfile might look like this: ``` FROM node:8-alpine WORKDIR /app COPY package.json . RUN npm install COPY . . EXPOSE 3000 CMD npm start ``` This example uses Node.js to build a simple Web applications. 3. Build a Docker image: Use a Dockerfile to build a Docker image. In your application folder, run the following command: ``` docker build -t my-web-app . ``` This command will build a Docker image called "my-web-app". You can change the image name as needed. 4. Run a Docker container: Use a Docker image to create a Docker container that runs your application. Run the following command on the command line: ``` docker run -p 8080:3000 my-web-app ``` This command will run a Docker container named "my-web-app" and set the container's port 3000 maps to port 8080 on your computer. You can change these ports as needed. 5. Access your application: You can now access your web application. Type "localhost:8080" into your web browser and you should see your application's home page. Above are some basic tutorial steps to deploy web application using Docker. Note that this is just a simple getting started guide, more complex applications may require more complex setup and steps to build and deploy them.
