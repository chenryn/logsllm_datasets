### 5.4 Survivability

Following the approach outlined in [3], a hierarchical survivability model can be constructed, incorporating both system availability and the system's transient response under failure conditions. For this purpose, the system availability model is utilized, with the expected excessive loss in overload (EELO) and expected excessive delay in overload (EEDO) assigned as the cost (reward) for each system failure occurrence. This results in composite measures such as excessive loss due to failures (ELF) or excessive delay due to failures (EDF), which serve as the system survivability metrics.

Consider the Voice over IP (VoIP) application on a wireless LAN. Since voice services are highly sensitive to delay, VoIP packets are dropped if their delay exceeds a certain threshold. Typically, this threshold is set equal to the VoIP packet inter-arrival time, meaning that no queue is formed for VoIP packets.

In this context, we focus on ELF, as connection outages are reflected in the number of dropped VoIP packets. If the packet inter-arrival time is \( T_s \), then the expected number of dropped packets in a state with a mean sojourn time of \( \frac{1}{\lambda} \) is given by:

\[
N(\lambda) = \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} \int_{i T_s}^{(i+1) T_s} \lambda e^{-\lambda t} dt = \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} e^{-i \lambda T_s} = \frac{e^{-\lambda T_s}}{1 - e^{-\lambda T_s}}
\]

The system survivability expressions for the three schemes are then:

\[
S_s = \lambda_{pf} \pi_s^{0,0} N(\lambda_{os} + \mu_{pr}) + \lambda_{os} \pi_s^{0,0} N(\lambda_{pf} + \lambda_{so}) + (\lambda_{os} \pi_s^{1,0}) N(\lambda_{so} + \mu_{pr})
\]

\[
S_{ra} = (\lambda_{pf} \pi_{ra}^{2,1}) N(\mu_{pr} + \lambda_{os}) + (\lambda_{os} \pi_{ra}^{0,0} + \lambda_{so} \pi_{ra}^{0,0}) N(\lambda_{so} + \lambda_s) + (\lambda_{os} \pi_{ra}^{0,1} + \lambda_{pf} \pi_{ra}^{0,0}) N(\lambda_{so} + \mu_{pr}) + (\lambda_{os} \pi_{ra}^{0,2} + \lambda_{rf} \pi_{ra}^{2,0}) N(\lambda_{so} + \mu_{rr})
\]

\[
S_{rr} = (\lambda_{pf} \pi_{rr}^{2,1}) N(\mu_{pr} + \lambda_{os}) + (\lambda_{os} \pi_{rr}^{0,0} + \lambda_{so} \pi_{rr}^{0,0}) N(\lambda_{so} + \lambda_s) + (\lambda_{os} \pi_{rr}^{0,2} + \lambda_{rf} \pi_{rr}^{2,1}) N(\mu_{pr} + \lambda_{os}) + (\lambda_{os} \pi_{rr}^{0,1}) N(\lambda_{so} + \mu_{pr}) + (\lambda_{os} \pi_{rr}^{0,2} + \lambda_{rf} \pi_{rr}^{2,0}) N(\lambda_{so} + \mu_{rr})
\]

### 6 Numerical Examples

For numerical evaluation, the system parameters are chosen as shown in Table 2.

| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| \(\lambda_{os}\) | 0.0001 per sec |
| \(\lambda_{so}\) | 0.001 per sec |
| \(\lambda_{pf}\) | 0.01 per hour |
| \(1/\lambda_{pr}\) | 20 min |
| \(\lambda_{rf}\) | 0.01 per hour (DS config.), 0.04 per hour (Forwarding config.) |
| \(1/\lambda_{rr}\) | 20 min |
| \(1/\lambda_s\) | 100 ms |
| \(T_s\) | 20 ms |

**Table 2. Parameters for Numerical Evaluation**

Figure 8 shows the reliability comparison of the three schemes. As expected, the scheme with a single AP has the lowest reliability. This is because the connection fails whenever the mobile node enters the shadow area, resulting in a mean time to failure of approximately 2.8 hours. In contrast, the use of redundant APs significantly increases reliability by covering the shadow regions.

**Figure 8. Connection Reliability**

Next, we compare the availability of these schemes with repair performed. Figure 9 illustrates the results, using the transition rate of the mobile entering the shadow area as the parameter. For clarity, we plot unavailability instead of availability. The redundant schemes show significant improvement, achieving an average availability of around 0.99, and are relatively insensitive to \(\lambda_{os}\) compared to the single AP scheme.

**Figure 9. Connection Unavailability vs. \(\lambda_{os}\)**

The system survivability, measured as the expected loss due to failures per second (ELF per second), is shown in Figure 10. With secondary APs in either configuration, the average number of packet losses due to failures is always below 1 packet per second. Conversely, the number of packet losses is much higher with the single AP scheme, exceeding 20 packets per second at higher \(\lambda_{os}\).

### 7 Conclusion

In this paper, we proposed the use of redundant access points as a means to "tolerate" the occurrence of shadow regions, rather than preventing them. The latter approach is common in cellular networks but is not feasible in wireless LANs due to spectrum assignment limitations. We also suggested adopting the 802.11e protocol enhancements to implement the redundant AP scheme and described two possible configurations of redundancy.

With the IEEE 802.11e protocol enhancements, our scheme not only provides coverage to shadow regions in wireless LANs without requiring additional bandwidth but also introduces minimal interference to mobile stations outside the shadow region through controlled contention channel access mechanisms.

Finally, our analytical models demonstrate that the proposed schemes offer higher dependability compared to the scheme without any redundancy techniques.
