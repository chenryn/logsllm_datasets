5.4 Survivability
Following the approach in [3], a hierarchical survivabil-
ity model may be constructed which involves both the sys-
tem availability and the system transient response under
failure conditions. For this purpose, the system availabil-
ity model may be used, with the expected excessive loss
in overload (EELO) and expected excessive delay in over-
load (EEDO) assigned as the cost (reward) for each system
failure occurrence. The composite measures in the form of
excessive loss due to failures (ELF) or excessive delay due
to failures (EDF) may thus be obtained as the system sur-
vivability measure.
Consider the voice over IP (VoIP) application on the
wireless LAN. Since voice services are delay sensitive,
VoIP packets are dropped if their delay has exceeded a cer-
tain threshold. Normally, this threshold is set equal to the
VoIP packet inter-arrival time, which means that no queue
is formed for VoIP packets.
In this sense, we study the ELF since the connection
outages are reﬂected in the amount of dropped VoIP pack-
ets. Suppose the packet inter-arrival time is Ts, then the
expected amount of dropped packets in a state with mean
sojourn time 1/λ is then

6 Numerical examples
As a numerical example, the system parameters are cho-
sen as in Table 2.
Figure 8 shows the reliability comparison of the three
schemes. As expected, the scheme with single AP has the
lowest reliability. This is due to the fact that the connection
fails whenever the mobile node enters the shadow area, and
thus the mean time to failure is 1/λos ≈ 2.8 hours. On the
other hand, the use of redundant AP increases the reliability
signiﬁcantly since the shadow regions are now covered.

Figure 8. Connection reliability
We then compare the availability of these schemes with
repair performed. Figure 9 shows the result with the transi-
tion rate of the mobile entering shadow area as the param-
eter. For better illustration purposes we plot un-availability
instead of availability. Again signiﬁcant improvement of re-
dundant schemes is observed, with which an average avail-
ability of around 0.99 may be achieved and it is relatively
not sensitive to λos compared with the single AP scheme.
The system survivability in the form of expected loss due
to failures per second (ELF per second) is illustrated in Fig-

ure 10. With secondary AP in either conﬁguration, the av-
erage number of packet losses due to failures is always be-
low 1 packet per second. On the other hand, the number of
packet losses is much higher with single AP scheme, which
exceeds 20 with higher λos.
7 Conclusion
In this paper, we proposed the use of redundant access
points as means to “tolerate” the occurance of shadow re-
gions as opposed to their prevention. The latter is the choice
in cellular networks but can not be employed in wireless
LANs due to spectrum assignment limitations. We also pro-
posed to adopt the 802.11e protocol enhancement to imple-
ment the redundant AP scheme and described two possible
conﬁgurations of redundancy.
With the IEEE 802.11e protocol enhancements, our
scheme not only provide coverage to shadow regions in
wireless LANs without the need for additional bandwidth,
but also introduce minimal interference to the mobile sta-
tions outside the shadow region by controlled contention
channel access mechanisms.
Last but not least, with analytical models, we illustrated
that our proposed schemes have higher dependability than
the scheme without any redundancy techniques.
