A.  Security of Teleoperated Surgical Robots 
Previous work on security of telerobotic surgical systems 
mainly focused on network and communication-based attacks. 
Bonaci  et  al.  performed  an  experimental  analysis  of 
different cyber-security attacks on the communication between 
the surgeon’s console and the robot on a RAVEN II platform 
[8]. They evaluated the threats posed by attacks that modify or 
manipulate  the  intent  of  the surgeon or  hijack  control  of  the 
robot. They showed that causing the user input packets to be 
delayed or get lost in transit to the robot might lead to jerky 
motions of the robotic arms or difficulty in performing tasks by 
human operators. However, the modification of packet contents 
led  the  safety  software  to  detect  the  over-current  commands 
sent  to  the  robot,  stop  the  robot’s  electrical  and  mechanical 
components, and prevent harm to the patient.  
Tozal et al. used an information coding approach to design 
a Secure and Statistically Reliable UDP (SSR-UDP) protocol 
that  ensures  confidentiality  and  reliability  of  telesurgical 
communications  in  wireless  environments  [5].  Lee  et  al.

proposed  Secure  ITP,  a  security  enhancement

protocols for authenticating the teleoperation console and slave 
robot as well as the surgeon and patient [6].  
(ITP), 
to 
Most of the previous studies assumed that compromising a 
surgeon’s  control  console or  the  robot  control  system  is  less 
likely  because  physical  access  to  the  system  is  prohibited 
through  strict  monitoring  [8].  Only  Coble  et  al.  studied  the 
possibility of compromising the robot software in unattended 
environments, such as the battlefield. They proposed the remote 
verification of system software and configuration files before 
execution, using remote software attestation [34].  
B.  Attacks on the Hospital Networks 
In this work, we assume that attackers exploit one of the 
existing vulnerabilities in the hospital networks as described in 
the  previous  work  to  get  access  to  the  telerobotic  surgical 
systems, without being detected by regular security monitoring 
mechanisms,  such  as  intrusion  detection  systems  or  remote 
software attestation techniques. Table V presents a summary of 
the recent reports on real attacks to hospital networks.  
For example, TrapX Security Inc. recently discovered three 
targeted attacks on a hospital’s network that passed through the 
protection  of  antivirus  software,  intrusion  detection  systems, 
and  firewalls.  In  one  case,  the  vulnerabilities  in  a  blood  gas 
analyzer  was  exploited  to  establish  a  backdoor  to  the  whole 
hospital network, allowing the attackers to install a malware on 
the system and steal patient data records from the hospital. In 
another  case,  the  attackers  gained  unauthorized  access  to  a 
clinic  workstation,  by  stealing  credentials  of  an  employee 
visiting  a  malicious website  and  installing a  malware  in  that 
machine  [10].  In  another  recent  study  on  a  wide  range  of 
medical devices in several hospitals, researchers from Essentia 
Health discovered that the internal firewalls used for protecting 
surgical  robots  from  external  connections  might  crash  upon 
running  a  vulnerability  scanner  against  them  and  enable 
unauthorized access to the robot [11]. In addition, there have 
been several recalls and adverse events reported to the FDA on 
random  attacks  on  hospital  networks  in  which  malware  or 
viruses  infected  medical  devices  such  as  imaging  systems, 
causing interruptions in patient therapy [39][40].  
VI. CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we described the anatomy of targeted attacks 
against the control systems of teleoperated surgical robots. We 
demonstrated these attacks on the RAVEN II surgical robot and 
experimentally evaluated their  impact on the operation of the 
robot control system and patients. Our results showed that the 
attacks  can  cause  either  sudden jumps  of  the  robotic  arms  or

Attack Entry Points 
Description 
Computers used by 
physicians, nurses, or 
technicians  
Vulnerable office 
devices 
Third party networks  Hospital networks are often connected to third party laboratories, 
pharmacies, and vendor networks that, if compromised, can let 
data breaches or penetrations into the hospital networks as well. 
The computers used by physicians, nurses, and vendor support 
technicians for remote access to the hospital network, could be 
compromised through credential stealing, virus, and malware. 
Office  devices  such  as  network  attached  desktops,  printers, 
faxes,  scanners,  and  security  cameras  with  default  or  weak 
passwords or vulnerable firmware could be an easy entry point. 
Incorrect  configurations  in  the  Wifi  access  points  or  gateway 
machines could expose vulnerabilities or leak information, such 
as device ID or hospital network layout, to the public.  
Medical  devices  on  hospital  network  may  have  default/weak 
passwords  or  unpatched  software/firmware,  which  can  be 
compromised.

access points, gateways

Vulnerabilities

personal 
phishing 
Two  medical  centers  and  more  than  3.9  million 
individuals were affected by a data breach through a third 
party portal/personal health record platform.  
Email 
compromised 
information of 3,300 patients. 
Default  username/passwords  for  the  multi-function 
printers and security cameras could be used for access to 
other devices on the hospital. 
Incorrect  configuration  of  a  gateway  computer  leaked 
critical information that made it possible for attackers to 
locate vulnerable devices within the hospital’s network. 
Three real-world attacks were detected, where a blood 
gas analyzer, a PAC system, and an X-ray machine were 
hijacked to open backdoors in hospital networks.

unavailability of the system due to an unwanted transition to a 
halt  state  in  the  middle  of  surgery.  We  presented  defense 
mechanisms  that  combine  understanding  of  the  semantics  of 
both software and physical components to predict the adverse 
consequences of attacks within the real-time constraints of the 
control  system.  The  mitigation  and  assessment  methods 
presented here can be applied to safety and security validation 
of a wider range of safety-critical cyber-physical systems.
