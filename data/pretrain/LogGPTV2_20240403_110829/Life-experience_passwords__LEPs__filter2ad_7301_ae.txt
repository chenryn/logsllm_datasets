Web passwords
Security questions
LEPs
– oﬀers the beneﬁt,
– almost oﬀers the beneﬁt, no circle – does not oﬀer the beneﬁt
– better than passwords,
– worse than passwords, no circle – no change
Table 5: Comparing security questions and LEPs to passwords using the UDS framework [68]. LEPs out-
perform passwords in six categories related to usability and security, and underperform in two deployability
categories. LEPs are also more usable and more secure than security questions.
35 hashes, 88% would need up to 70, 92% would need up to
126 hashes, and the worst case scenario would require 1,287
hashes. Even in the worst case, the storage cost would only
amount to several Kilobytes per user, which is negligible for
today’s server storage. Because one-way hashing is fast, the
processing cost should also be acceptable. We could fur-
ther limit the storage cost of LEPs by discarding all but N
strongest facts, at creation time. For M = [3, 4] and N = 8
each LEP would require at most 70 hashes.
5.3 LEPs Are Strong Against Guessing
This section discusses results of our friend guessing study,
described in Section 4. We recruited a total of 91 partici-
pants and a few participants came in groups of 3 or more
people, forming 100 diﬀerent pairs. All of the participants
completed the study in the same sitting. The participants
were students from our institution from freshmen to gradu-
ate students, with majors in engineering, social science, the-
ater, biology, math, international relations, music, business,
economics, psychology, and linguistics.
Participants knew each other between 3 months to 6 years.
All of them were already friends on at least one social net-
work (e.g., Facebook, Instagram, etc) and were encouraged
to use social networks and public sources during guessing.
For participant pairs that were not from the US, both par-
ticipants were from the same country and shared the same
cultural background, which helped them make more edu-
cated guesses. Average closeness rating on the scale 1–5,
with 1 being the lowest, was 2.6 for the guided group, and
3 for the semi-guided group.
Most users were able to fully authenticate with their LEPs
in the second stage of our study. A few authentication fail-
ures we observed were due to misspelling, synonyms and
more/less speciﬁc answers provided during authentication
than during creation.
We show friend guessing success in the Table 3, rows 13–
16 using the same authentication schemes as in Section 3.4.
Guess success rate is very low (0–0.7%) for all-fact authen-
tication, and climbs up to 1.3–4.5%, for three-fact authen-
tication. Taken together with recall results, this data sug-
gests that the four-fact authentication seems to strike the
right balance between achieving high authentication success
(70-73%), and reasonable strength, while keeping the friend
guessing success low (0–0.7%).
Compared to security questions, where friends could guess
17–25% [91], LEP’s are 3.7–35× stronger, assuming four-fact
or three-fact authentication.
Guess success rate per fact category, for facts described
in Table 1, is shown in column 4 of Table 4. Friends could
successfully guess more than half of the cities, and more
than 20% of relationships, places, ﬁrst names, and facts in
HU and TN categories. Other categories, such as FL, PL,
OBJ, DT and YR had lower guess success. This shows an-
other strength of LEPs over security questions. Bonnie et
al. found that security questions could not strike the right
balance between security and memorability, because facts
that were memorable for users were also easily guessed [67,
91]. Conversely, LEPs have multiple fact categories with
high user recall and low friend guess rate (e.g., FN, FL, PL,
OBJ).
Participant Feedback. We carefully observed partici-
pant behavior during guessing and interviewed them about
their strategy after the study. Except two participants, who
attempted random guesses, the rest invested signiﬁcant ef-
fort in looking for possible guess options online. They re-
ported using the following information sources for guessing:
personal knowledge, Facebook, Google search engine, Insta-
gram, RenRen, WeChat, QQ, Line, LinkedIn, and Spokeo.
Overall, 78–83% of participants reported using personal kno-
wledge, 76–79% used social networks and 50–56% used search
engines. At social networks, participants checked the per-
sonal proﬁle and friend lists ﬁrst, and then scanned the re-
122
cent wall posts. They complemented this with online searches
for popular items which appeared in LEP questions.
We further collected participant feedback on why guess-
ing LEPs was hard. About half of responses (48%) stated
that LEPs involved too much detail about the topic, which
was hard to mine from online sources or from personal kno-
wledge. Unless the friend participated in the same event,
it was diﬃcult to mine correct answers online. In addition,
26% of participants acknowledged that many facts were too
personal and thus not shared among friends, nor used in so-
cial network posts, such as events from early childhood and
elementary school. These private and unique facts make
guessing diﬃcult, unlike facts used for security questions,
which can be easily found in online sources.
When asked about what they liked about LEPs, 58.2%
of participants stated that LEPs were much harder to guess
than the current security questions, and more memorable
than ordinary passwords since they were built from personal
experience. In addition, 11.4% participants said that the va-
riety of question sets and their detail were another advantage
of LEPs over security questions. The downsides reported by
participants were the time it took to come up with answers
(6.3% of participants) and the concern about memorability
(19% of participants).
More than 90% of participants reported that they would
consider using and adapting LEPs for diﬀerent online ac-
counts, while 6.3% said that they did not plan to use LEPs
due to time overhead and concerns about memorabilty. 44.3%
were willing to use LEPs for an online banking account,
which needs high security, and has less frequent logins, 31.6%
said they would use LEPs for secure and professional email
accounts, and 17.7% would use them for government ac-
counts and health records.
5.4 LEPs Are Usable and Secure
In [68], Bonneau et al. present the usability-deployability-
security (UDS) framework – they deﬁne 25 properties of Web
authentication schemes and use them to rate 35 password-
replacement schemes. We reproduce the rating of passwords
and personal knowledge (security) questions in Table 5, and
add our rating for LEPs.
LEPs outperform passwords in six categories. Regarding
usability, LEPs are Quasi-Memorywise-Eﬀortless, as users
still forget some LEP facts. They are Quasi-Scalable-for-
Users, since users have abundance of memories that servers
can elicit by randomizing topic oﬀerings, as we did in our
user studies. They are further Infrequent-Errors, as our
imprecise matching takes care of many causes of authen-
tication failures. Regarding security, LEPs are Resilient-to-
Throttled-Guessing and Quasi-Resilient-to-Unthrottled-Guess-
ing, as our evaluation shows. Thanks to low LEP reuse,
they are also Quasi-Resilient-to-Leaks-from Other Veriﬁers.
LEPs do worse than passwords in one usability, two deploy-
ability and one security category. They are less Eﬃcient-to-
Use, as they take longer to create and authenticate. They
are not Server-Compatible nor Mature, because they are a
research technology and are not widely deployed. Security-
wise, LEPs are Quasi-Resilient-to-Targeted-Impersonation –
friends can guess a very small portion of LEPs.
LEPs outperform security questions in six categories. They
are Quasi-Scalable-for-Users, due to their wide applicabil-
ity and broad range of topics, while security questions are
not. They are further Infrequent-Errors, because we ap-
ply imprecise matching. LEPs are further Quasi-Resilient-
to-Targeted-Impersonation, Resilient-to-Throttled-Guessing,
Quasi-Resilient-to-Unthrottled-Guessing, and Quasi-Resilient-
to-Leaks-from-Other-Veriﬁers, while security questions have
none of these qualities. There are only two categories where
LEPs lag after security questions – they are less Eﬃcient-
to-Use and not Mature.
Comparing LEPs to other 33 authentication technologies
in publication [68] (Table I in [68]), only federated authenti-
cation schemes oﬀer both better usability and security, but
at the cost of lower deployability. Thus LEPs are compet-
itive against other authentication schemes, and can oﬀer a
unique combination of features.
6. CONCLUSIONS
Textual passwords are a widely-used form of authentica-
tion and suﬀer from many deﬁciencies because users trade
security for memorability. Users create weak passwords be-
cause they are memorable, and reuse the same password
across many sites. Forcing users to create strong passwords
does not help, as these are easily forgotten.
We have proposed life-experience passwords (LEPs) as a
new authentication mechanism, which strikes a good balance
between security and memorability. We investigated several
LEP designs, and evaluated them in two user studies. Our
