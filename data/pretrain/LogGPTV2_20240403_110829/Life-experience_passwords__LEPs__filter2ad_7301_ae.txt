### Life-Experience Passwords (LEPs): A Comprehensive Analysis

#### 5.3 LEPs Are Strong Against Guessing

This section discusses the results of our friend guessing study, as described in Section 4. We recruited a total of 91 participants, with some participants coming in groups of three or more, forming 100 different pairs. All participants completed the study in one sitting. The participants were students from our institution, ranging from freshmen to graduate students, with majors in engineering, social sciences, theater, biology, mathematics, international relations, music, business, economics, psychology, and linguistics.

Participants had known each other for between 3 months and 6 years. All of them were already friends on at least one social network (e.g., Facebook, Instagram, etc.) and were encouraged to use social networks and public sources during the guessing process. For participant pairs not from the US, both participants were from the same country and shared the same cultural background, which helped them make more educated guesses. The average closeness rating on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being the lowest, was 2.6 for the guided group and 3 for the semi-guided group.

Most users were able to fully authenticate with their LEPs in the second stage of our study. A few authentication failures were due to misspellings, synonyms, and more/less specific answers provided during authentication than during creation.

The friend guessing success rates are shown in Table 3, rows 13–16, using the same authentication schemes as in Section 3.4. The guess success rate is very low (0–0.7%) for all-fact authentication and climbs up to 1.3–4.5% for three-fact authentication. Combined with recall results, this data suggests that four-fact authentication strikes the right balance between achieving high authentication success (70-73%) and reasonable strength while keeping the friend guessing success low (0–0.7%).

Compared to security questions, where friends could guess 17–25% [91], LEPs are 3.7–35 times stronger, assuming four-fact or three-fact authentication.

The guess success rate per fact category, for facts described in Table 1, is shown in column 4 of Table 4. Friends could successfully guess more than half of the cities and more than 20% of relationships, places, first names, and facts in the HU and TN categories. Other categories, such as FL, PL, OBJ, DT, and YR, had lower guess success rates. This highlights another strength of LEPs over security questions. Bonnie et al. found that security questions could not strike the right balance between security and memorability because facts that were memorable for users were also easily guessed [67, 91]. Conversely, LEPs have multiple fact categories with high user recall and low friend guess rates (e.g., FN, FL, PL, OBJ).

**Participant Feedback:**
We carefully observed participant behavior during guessing and interviewed them about their strategies after the study. Except for two participants who attempted random guesses, the rest invested significant effort in looking for possible guess options online. They reported using the following information sources for guessing: personal knowledge, Facebook, Google search engine, Instagram, RenRen, WeChat, QQ, Line, LinkedIn, and Spokeo. Overall, 78–83% of participants reported using personal knowledge, 76–79% used social networks, and 50–56% used search engines. On social networks, participants checked personal profiles and friend lists first and then scanned recent wall posts. They complemented this with online searches for popular items that appeared in LEP questions.

We further collected participant feedback on why guessing LEPs was difficult. About half of the responses (48%) stated that LEPs involved too much detail about the topic, which was hard to mine from online sources or personal knowledge. Unless the friend participated in the same event, it was difficult to find correct answers online. Additionally, 26% of participants acknowledged that many facts were too personal and thus not shared among friends or used in social network posts, such as events from early childhood and elementary school. These private and unique facts make guessing difficult, unlike facts used for security questions, which can be easily found in online sources.

When asked about what they liked about LEPs, 58.2% of participants stated that LEPs were much harder to guess than current security questions and more memorable than ordinary passwords since they were built from personal experiences. Additionally, 11.4% of participants said that the variety of question sets and their detail were another advantage of LEPs over security questions. The downsides reported by participants included the time it took to come up with answers (6.3% of participants) and concerns about memorability (19% of participants).

More than 90% of participants reported that they would consider using and adapting LEPs for different online accounts, while 6.3% said they did not plan to use LEPs due to time overhead and concerns about memorability. 44.3% were willing to use LEPs for an online banking account, which needs high security and has less frequent logins. 31.6% said they would use LEPs for secure and professional email accounts, and 17.7% would use them for government accounts and health records.

#### 5.4 LEPs Are Usable and Secure

In [68], Bonneau et al. present the usability-deployability-security (UDS) framework, defining 25 properties of web authentication schemes and using them to rate 35 password-replacement schemes. We reproduce the rating of passwords and personal knowledge (security) questions in Table 5 and add our rating for LEPs.

LEPs outperform passwords in six categories. Regarding usability, LEPs are Quasi-Memorywise-Effortless, as users still forget some LEP facts. They are Quasi-Scalable-for-Users, since users have an abundance of memories that servers can elicit by randomizing topic offerings, as we did in our user studies. They are further Infrequent-Errors, as our imprecise matching takes care of many causes of authentication failures. Regarding security, LEPs are Resilient-to-Throttled-Guessing and Quasi-Resilient-to-Unthrottled-Guessing, as our evaluation shows. Thanks to low LEP reuse, they are also Quasi-Resilient-to-Leaks-from-Other-Verifiers.

LEPs do worse than passwords in one usability, two deployability, and one security category. They are less Efficient-to-Use, as they take longer to create and authenticate. They are not Server-Compatible nor Mature, because they are a research technology and are not widely deployed. Security-wise, LEPs are Quasi-Resilient-to-Targeted-Impersonation – friends can guess a very small portion of LEPs.

LEPs outperform security questions in six categories. They are Quasi-Scalable-for-Users, due to their wide applicability and broad range of topics, while security questions are not. They are further Infrequent-Errors, because we apply imprecise matching. LEPs are further Quasi-Resilient-to-Targeted-Impersonation, Resilient-to-Throttled-Guessing, Quasi-Resilient-to-Unthrottled-Guessing, and Quasi-Resilient-to-Leaks-from-Other-Verifiers, while security questions lack these qualities. There are only two categories where LEPs lag behind security questions – they are less Efficient-to-Use and not Mature.

Comparing LEPs to other 33 authentication technologies in publication [68] (Table I in [68]), only federated authentication schemes offer both better usability and security but at the cost of lower deployability. Thus, LEPs are competitive against other authentication schemes and can offer a unique combination of features.

### 6. Conclusions

Textual passwords are a widely-used form of authentication and suffer from many deficiencies because users trade security for memorability. Users create weak passwords because they are memorable and reuse the same password across many sites. Forcing users to create strong passwords does not help, as these are easily forgotten.

We have proposed life-experience passwords (LEPs) as a new authentication mechanism, which strikes a good balance between security and memorability. We investigated several LEP designs and evaluated them in two user studies.
