User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题systemd-journald Doesn't start at all After deleting my /var/log/journal by accident, I am unable to recover from the consequences. systemd-journald keeps failing over and over again every time I try to start it. when I run:

$ journalctl --verify
PASS: /run/log/journal/system.journal


which doesn't bring me one step closer to solve it because /run/log/journal/system.journal is created when I run /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-journald directly, which on it self outputs 

$ /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-journald
Failed to open runtime journal: Invalid argument


Things I have already tried:


cleaning /var/log/journal and/run/log/journal`.
copying /var/log/journal from another machine to both paths, running journalctl --verify to check them, and once again with --file flag.
changing Storage setting in /etc/systemd/journald.conf to Storage=volatile just to disable /var/log/journald.
Rebooting.

Assistant: After renaming the hostname, deleting &amp; recreating /etc/machine-id by running systemd-machine-id-setup and rebooting to apply these, systemd-journald came back to life!
