I recently installed Python 3.2, but when I opened WingIDE on my Mac, it still only showed the older version, Python 2.6.1. I attempted to resolve this by going to "Configure Python" and entering the path to Python 3.2 in the "Python Executable" field, but nothing changed—WingIDE continued to show Python 2.6.1.

Interestingly, when I launched WingIDE again, it now recognized Python 3.2, even though I didn't make any additional changes. However, when I use the terminal, it still only recognizes Python 2.6.1.

**Assistant:**

It sounds like you've made some progress with WingIDE, but the terminal is still using the older Python version. Here are a few steps to troubleshoot and ensure that Python 3.2 is correctly set up:

1. **Check if Python 3.2 is in your PATH:**
   - Open the terminal and type `which python3.2` to see if it returns the path to Python 3.2. If it does, you can try running `python3.2` directly from the terminal.
   - If it doesn’t return a path, you may need to add Python 3.2 to your PATH. You can do this by adding the following line to your shell profile file (e.g., `.bash_profile`, `.zshrc`, etc.):
     ```sh
     export PATH="/usr/bin/python3.2:$PATH"
     ```
   - After adding the line, reload the profile with `source ~/.bash_profile` or `source ~/.zshrc` (depending on your shell).

2. **Verify the location of Python 3.2:**
   - Use the `which` command to find the exact location of Python 3.2:
     ```sh
     which python3.2
     ```
   - If the path is different from `/usr/bin/python3.2`, you should use the correct path in WingIDE and in your shell profile.

3. **Update WingIDE to use the correct Python executable:**
   - In WingIDE, go to "Project > Project Properties > Python Executable" and enter the full path to the Python 3.2 executable (e.g., `/usr/bin/python3.2`).
   - Make sure to save the changes and restart WingIDE if necessary.

By following these steps, you should be able to ensure that both WingIDE and the terminal recognize and use Python 3.2.
