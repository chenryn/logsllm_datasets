User: I have this silly question. I analyze data packets with scapy. And there is a variable inside the packet, it's called timestamp (TSFT) , which is the time that the packet was constructed. So i grab that vairable (packet[RadioTap].TSFT) but I do not know if the value is in nanoseconds or in microseconds. 
Could anyone inform me ? I haven't seen it anywhere.
Thanks in advance.
Assistant: The timestamp is in seconds.
You can import datetime in python and use its fromtimestamp method to get it in a easier to read format like so.
import datetime
ts = datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(1305354670.602149)
print ts
2011-05-14 02:31:10.602149
Hope this helped.
