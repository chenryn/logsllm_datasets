In Polish language exists letter 'Å›', written by pressing rightAlt+s. In atom
this combination brings up the 'Spec suite' window.  
Worth noticing is fact, that in settings shortcut responsible for this is
**ctrl** -alt-s, yet rightAlt+s alone brings up the window too.  
I tried adding
    'body':
      'ralt-s': ''
      'ctrl-alt-s' : ''
to the keymap, but it didn't fix my problem.
Expected change:
  * chaning default shortcut to a non-colliding one  
or
  * making only ctrl-alt-s as hotkey and not rightAlt-s,
