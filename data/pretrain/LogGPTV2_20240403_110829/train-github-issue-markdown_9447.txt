### Apache Airflow Version
main (development)

### Issue Description
I am opening this issue as per the comment in #23727. We have observed an issue with our setup, which uses the Kubernetes executor on version 2.1.x. After upgrading to the main branch (version 2.4.1 at the time of writing), new task instances created post-upgrade work correctly, but older task instances fail with a similar traceback as shown below.

### Traceback

    return self._startup_probe
AttributeError: 'V1Container' object has no attribute '_startup_probe'
```

### Expected Behavior
Older task instances that cannot be serialized should return an empty dictionary instead of failing completely. A fix similar to #24117 should be implemented, where a custom `String` field for `executor_config` in the task instance schema calls the `_serialize` method and returns an empty dictionary as a string on error.

### Reproduction Steps
1. Upgrade from an older version like 2.1.x to the main branch (e.g., 2.4.1) with task instances and `executor_config` using the Kubernetes executor.
2. Access the task instance endpoint for old DAG runs to fetch task instances with `executor_config` serialized. The traceback will be thrown.
