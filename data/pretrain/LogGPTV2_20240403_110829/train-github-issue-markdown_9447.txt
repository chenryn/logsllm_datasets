### Apache Airflow version
main (development)
### What happened
Opening issue as per comment : #23727 (comment) . We have also noticed this
issue where we have a 2.1.x setup using Kubernetes executor and on upgrade the
new task instances created post upgrade are working fine in task instance
endpoint. The old objects fail with similar traceback as below. We also tried
main branch (2.4.1 as of writing) and it also has same issue. It seems a fix
similar to #24117 has to be made with a custom String field for
`executor_config` in task instance schema that calls the `_serialize` method
and on error returns empty dict as string. We have a fix internally though a
test case might not be possible since it needs an older value of
executor_config that we can't export due to private data. I will be happy to
make a PR with the fix though and opened this issue for discussion,

### What you think should happen instead
Older task instances that cannot be serialized should possibly return empty
dict instead of failing completely.
### How to reproduce
  1. Upgrade to main branch from an older version like 2.1.x with task instances and executor_config using Kubernetes as executor.
  2. Hit task instance endpoint of old dagrun to fetch task instances with executor_config serialized. The traceback is thrown.
