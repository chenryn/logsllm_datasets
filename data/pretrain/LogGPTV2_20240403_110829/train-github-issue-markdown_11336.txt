It appears that there is a lack of documentation for the macros `@inline` and `@inbounds`:

- When attempting to access the help documentation for `@inline`, the following message is returned:
  ```
  help?> @inline
  No documentation found.
  Base.@inline is a macro.
  # 1 method for macro "@inline":
  @inline(ex::ANY)
  ```

- Similarly, for `@inbounds`, the output is as follows:
  ```
  help?> @inbounds
  No documentation found.
  Base.@inbounds is a macro.
  # 1 method for macro "@inbounds":
  @inbounds(blk::ANY<:Any) in Base at essentials.jl:162
  ```

This suggests that both macros are currently not well-documented. For more context, this issue may be partially related to or a duplicate of issue #9405.
