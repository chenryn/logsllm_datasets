### Dissemination and Invasion of Privacy

The concept of privacy encompasses two primary aspects: dissemination (including breach of confidentiality, disclosure, exposure, increased accessibility, blackmail, appropriation, and distortion) and invasion (such as intrusion and decisional interference). This framework begins with the data subject (the individual) from whom various entities (other people, governments, businesses) collect information. The qualification of information processing depends on the harmfulness of these activities. Subsequently, the dissemination of information further distances control from the concerned individual. Finally, privacy can be (illegally) invaded by third parties.

### Information Privacy as a Public Value

Greater attention should be given to understanding information privacy in a functional sense as a type of public value, as it benefits and shapes society. From this perspective, information privacy exhibits characteristics of a commons that require social and legal control for construction and maintenance. Consequently, data protection approaches are becoming part of social policy. In this context, the privacy commons is a multidimensional "territory" that should be regulated through legislation structuring anonymous and semi-anonymous information spaces. Therefore, the propertization of personal information should be limited to the extent that it undermines the privacy commons.

### Individual Autonomy and Balancing Interests

In summary, the different models described rely heavily on individual autonomy, which implies that the individual has the right to control their information. However, this approach does not account for public interests such as ordre public and security. Thus, a balancing test appears inevitable. Before delving into the details, the theoretical approaches already discussed will be evaluated.

## Mitigation of Privacy Risks through Data Protection Rules

### Potential Legal Responses

#### Overview

Mayer-Schönberger's seminal book, *Delete*, provides an extensive examination of data protection principles in the context of the right to be forgotten. He discusses seven potential (legal) responses to mitigate the ills of digital memory:

1. **Digital Abstinence**: This solution, based on choice and autonomy, suggests that individuals avoid interactions requiring the revelation of personal information. However, this approach faces challenges due to varying knowledge and preferences among individuals and the benefits of sharing personal information, such as innovative forms of content creation.

2. **Information Privacy Rights**: This approach is based on informational self-determination, where individuals have control over the use of their personal information. However, practical implementation, especially through consent, is difficult, and liability claims against non-compliant data collectors are rare.

3. **Digital Privacy Rights Infrastructure**: Lawrence Lessig suggested using Digital Rights Management (DRM) to protect personal information. However, DRM's effectiveness is questionable, and it risks creating a pervasive surveillance system.

4. **Cognitive Adjustment**: This approach involves changing societal attitudes towards comprehensive digital memory without altering laws or technology. The feasibility of such a cognitive shift is uncertain.

5. **Information Ecology**: Advocates for a more stringent and comprehensive information ecology propose slowing down the speed of information collection and storage. However, this approach faces conceptual and political challenges.

6. **Perfect Contextualization**: This approach aims to limit data collection to relevant contexts. While technically challenging, it requires sustained attention and may not be fully achievable.

Mayer-Schönberger categorizes these responses under "Information Power" and "Cognition, Decision-Making, and Time."

### Expiration Dates on Digital Data

The seventh response is the introduction of expiration dates on digital information. Technically, this would be relatively easy to implement, making information processors' roles more significant. If expiration dates on information files are insufficient, a more granular approach, such as the expiration of information bits, could be used. This includes cookies and expiration dates for web page links and search queries. The advantage is that users need only set expiration dates, avoiding the complexity of new technologies.

However, the ubiquity of social networking complicates the practical application of expiration dates. Additionally, the human desire to chronicle life and immortalize memories contradicts the self-censorship required by this approach.

### Potential Technological Responses

Technology plays a crucial role in the interplay between identity, memory, and privacy. Governments and civil societies are still grappling with new technological realities. While technology can provide solutions to data protection concerns, public uncertainty remains due to the complexity and potential negative outcomes of new technologies.

For example, devices providing "Continuous Archival and Retrieval of Personal Experiences" (CARPE) aim to enhance control over collective knowledge but can also be used for third-party control. These technologies often fail to meet their potential because they do not operate in a social vacuum.

Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs) can be oriented towards the subject, object, transaction, or system. Subject-oriented PETs limit the ability of other users to discern identities, while object-oriented PETs protect identities through specific technologies. Transaction-oriented PETs protect transactional data, and system-oriented PETs create zones of interaction where users and objects remain hidden.

Despite the potential of technology to support individual control over data, it cannot replace the legislator in defining the scope and limits of a new fundamental "right to be forgotten."

### Outlook

With the increasing tendency to make all types of information public, privacy is at risk. Despite existing and planned data protection laws, new fundamental rights concepts are being developed. For instance, the German Constitutional Court introduced a "computer confidentiality and integrity right" to prevent third-party interference with personal electronic communication. Similarly, the European Union proposed a right to be forgotten in the context of revising the Data Protection Directive 95/46. However, a concrete description of the right's scope and contents is still pending.
