Microsoft Malware Protection Center’s team of researchers identify, reverse engineer, and develop malware signatures and then deploy them across our infrastructure for advanced detection and defense. These signatures are distributed to our responders, customers and the industry through Windows Updates and notifications to protect their devices.
Microsoft Security Development Lifecycle (SDL) is a software development process that helps developers build more secure software and address security compliance requirements while reducing development cost. The SDL is used to harden all applications, online services and products, and to routinely validate its effectiveness through penetration testing and vulnerability scanning.
Threat modeling and attack surface analysis ensures that potential threats are assessed, exposed aspects of the service are evaluated, and the attack surface is minimized by restricting services or eliminating unnecessary functions.
Classifying data according to its sensitivity and taking the appropriate measures to protect it, including encryption in transit and at rest, and enforcing the principle of least-privilege access provides additional protection. • Awareness training that fosters a trust relationship between the user and the security team to develop an environment where users will report incidents and anomalies without fear of repercussion.
Having a rich set of controls and a defense-in-depth strategy helps ensure that should any one area fail, there are compensating controls in other areas to help maintain the security and privacy of our customers, cloud services, and our own infrastructure. However, no environment is truly impenetrable, as people will make errors and determined adversaries will continue to look for vulnerabilities and exploit them. The significant investments we continue to make in these protection layers and baseline analysis enables us to rapidly detect when abnormal activity is present.
DETECT
Detect
The CDOC teams employ automated software, machine learning, behavioral analysis, and forensic techniques to create an intelligent security graph of our environment. This signal is enriched with contextual metadata and behavioral models generated from sources such as Active Directory, asset and configuration management systems, and event logs.
Our extensive investments in security analytics build rich behavioral profiles and predictive models that allow us to “connect the dots” and identify advanced threats that might otherwise have gone undetected, then counter with strong containment and coordinated remediation activities.
Microsoft also employs custom-developed security software, along with industryleading tools and machine learning. Our threat intelligence is continually evolving, with automated data-enrichment to more rapidly detect malicious activity and report with high fidelity. Vulnerability scans are performed regularly to test and refine the effectiveness of protective measures. The breadth of Microsoft’s investment in its security ecosystem and the variety of signals monitored by the CDOC teams provide a more comprehensive threat view than can be achieved by most service providers.
Microsoft’s detection tactics include:
Monitoring network and physical environments 24x7x365 for potential cybersecurity events. Behavior profiling is based on usage patterns and an understanding of unique threats to our services.
Identity and behavioral analytics are developed to highlight abnormal activity.
Machine learning software tools and techniques are routinely used to discover and flag irregularities.
Advanced analytical tools and processes are deployed to further identify anomalous activity and innovative correlation capabilities. This enables highlycontextualized detections to be created from the enormous volumes of data in near real-time.
Automated software-based processes that are continuously audited and evolved for increased effectiveness.
Data scientists and security experts routinely work side-by-side to address escalated events that exhibit unusual characteristics requiring further analysis of targets. They can then determine potential response and remediation efforts.
RESPOND
Respond
When Microsoft detects abnormal activity in our systems, it triggers our response teams to engage and quickly respond with precise force. Notifications from software-based detection systems flow through our automated response systems using risk-based algorithms to flag events requiring intervention from our response team. Mean-Time-to-Mitigate is paramount and our automation system provides responders with relevant, actionable information that accelerates triage, mitigation, and recovery.
To manage security incidents at such a massive scale, we deploy a tiered system to efficiently assign response tasks to the right resource and facilitate a rational escalation path.
Microsoft’s response tactics include:
Automated response systems use risk-based algorithms to flag events requiring human intervention.
Automated response systems use risk-based algorithms to flag events requiring human intervention.
Well-defined, documented, and scalable incident response processes within a continuous improvement model helps to keep us ahead of adversaries by making these available to all responders.
Subject matter expertise across our teams, in multiple security areas, provides a diverse skill set for addressing incidents. Security expertise in incident response, forensics, and intrusion analysis; and a deep understanding of the platforms, services, and applications operating in our cloud datacenters.
Wide enterprise searching across cloud, hybrid and on-premises data and systems to determine the scope of an incident.
Deep forensic analysis for major threats are performed by specialists to understand incidents and to aid in their containment and eradication. • Microsoft’s security software tools, automation and hyper-scale cloud infrastructure enable our security experts to reduce the time to detect, investigate, analyze, respond, and recover from cyberattacks.
Penetration testing is employed across all Microsoft products and services through ongoing Red Team/Blue Team exercises to unearth vulnerabilities before a real adversary can leverage those weak points for an attack.
Cyberdefense for our customers
We are often asked what tools and processes our customers can adopt for their own environment and how Microsoft might help in their implementation. Microsoft has consolidated many of the cyberdefense products and services we use in the CDOC into a range of products and services. The Microsoft Enterprise Cybersecurity Group and Microsoft Consulting Services teams engage with our customers to deliver the solutions most appropriate for their specific needs and requirements.
One of the first steps that Microsoft highly recommends is to establish a security foundation. Our foundation services provide critical attack defenses and core identity-enablement services that help you to ensure assets are protected. The foundation helps you to accelerate your digital transformation journey to move towards a more secure modern enterprise.
Building on this foundation, customers can then leverage solutions proven successful with other Microsoft customers and deployed in Microsoft’s own IT and cloud services environments. For more information on our enterprise cybersecurity tools, capabilities and service offerings, please visit Microsoft.com/security and contact our teams at cyberservices@microsoft.com.
