Question: In the context of a hardware system design, consider that Unit_B is designed with 8 kilobytes of internal memory. This memory is mapped into a 32 kilobyte address range in the system fabric address map. The system address decoder for Unit_B is designed to mask off the upper 13 bits, decoding only the lower bits to compute the offset into the internal memory space. If an untrusted agent discovers that the memory protection unit only restricts access to the first 8 kilobyte range, which of the following actions would effectively mitigate the risk of the untrusted agent accessing the mirrored or aliased memory regions?
"A": "Program the MPU to apply protection policies to the full 32 kilobyte address range mapped to Unit_B.",
"B": "Restrict access to the internal memory of Unit_B to privileged software by implementing secure boot mechanisms.",
"C": "Block all system software from accessing the aliased address ranges that are not needed for normal operations.",
"D": "Increase the memory range of Unit_B to 64 kilobytes to prevent any possible aliasing."
Answer: AC
