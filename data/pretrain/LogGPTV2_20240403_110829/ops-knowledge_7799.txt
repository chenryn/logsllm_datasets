Question: "Suppose you are administering a group of Mac computers with Apple silicon for a development team that requires the ability to run both older versions of macOS and third-party kernel extensions for testing purposes. Given the security policies described, which security policies would you consider setting on these Macs, and what are the potential risks associated with each policy?"
 "A": "Setting the Macs to Reduced Security policy allows running older macOS versions but does not protect against rollback attacks and requires rebooting to load third-party kernel extensions."
 "B": "Configuring the Macs with Permissive Security policy enables signature verification along the secure boot chain but allows loading a custom XNU kernel, which may compromise decryption keys for trusted operating systems."
 "C": "Enabling No Security mode, similar to Permissive Security, will disable the signature verification process entirely, allowing any operating system kernel to be loaded without constraints."
 "D": "Applying Medium Security policy allows for the use of third-party kernel extensions without the risk of operating system compromise as it enforces kext signature verification at runtime."
Answer: AB
