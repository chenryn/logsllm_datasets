Table 7: Number of members (out of 10,000) exposed by Yeom et al. membership inference attack on neural network (CIFAR-100).
The non-private ( = ∞) model leaks 0, 556 and 7349 members for 1%, 2% and 5% FPR respectively.
exposing over 73% of training set members at 5% false pos-
itive rate, compared to only 7% for the logistic regression
model.2 The privacy mechanisms provide substantial reduc-
tion in exposure, even with high  budgets, but the relaxed
variants expose more members compared to naïve composi-
tion and advanced composition.
Figure 6(c) depicts the privacy leakage due to attribute
inference attack on the neural network models. Naïve com-
position and advanced composition are both resistant to the
attack for  ≤ 100, but the relaxed variants reveal some privacy
leakage for lower privacy budgets.
