User: If I send two TCP messages, do I need to handle the case where the latter arrives before the former? Or is it guaranteed to arrive in the order I send it? I assume that this is not a Twisted-specific example, because it should conform to the TCP standard, but if anyone familiar with Twisted could provide a Twisted-specific answer for my own peace of mind, that'd be appreciated :-)
Assistant: TCP is a stream, UDP is a message. You're mixing up terms. For TCP it is true that the stream will arrive in the same order as it was send. There are no distict messages in TCP, bytes appear as they arrive, interpreting them as messages is up to you.
