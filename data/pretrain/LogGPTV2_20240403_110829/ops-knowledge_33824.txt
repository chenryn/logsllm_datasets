User: When mounting and writing files in the google cloud storage using the gcsfs, the gcsfs is creating folders and files but not writing files. Most of the times it shows input/output error. It even occurs even when we copy files from local directory to the mounted gcsfs directory.
gcsfs version 0.15
Assistant: Although this is quiet an old topic, I will try to provide an answer especially because of people who might stumble on this in the course of their own work. I have experience using more recent versions of gcsfs and it works quiet well. You can find the latest documentation at https://gcsfs.readthedocs.io/en/latest. To make it work you need to have the environment variable:
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY.json.
