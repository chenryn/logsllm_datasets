tion feedback for the attestation procedure. In this use-case,
the critical zone takes place when the printer head is extrud-
ing ﬁlament; its path is ﬁxed. Thus the attestation procedure
can take place between printing layers after the printer head
is raised to satisfy the spacial aspect of the critical zone. A
similar argument can be made for subtractive manufactur-
ing applications, like laser engraving or CNC milling. Their
setups are similar to 3D printing, with precise but relative
motion control and an on/off-type process dictating their criti-
cal zones. Once again, the addition of cost-effective external
sensors can allow the attestation of these processes.

Remote Attestation. Remote attestation for embedded sys-
tems has been studied form many years, however, typi-
cally these approaches do not provide real-time execution
guarantees for the system (at least while attestation is in
progress) [10, 15, 30, 59]. The fundamental conﬂict between
real-time execution and attestation has to be discussed by
Carpent et al. [13]. Additionally, these approaches rely on
a (hardware) root-of-trust, which is not available in today’s
CPS. Software-based attestation does not require a root-of-
trust [28, 36, 37, 52–54], but can only provide uncertain secu-
rity guarantees [55]. Valente et al. propose to leverage control-
command variations to validate the correctness of a system’s
physical operations rather than the system software integrity,
providing “a weak attestation” [61]. Our proposed scheme
combines software-based attestation with control-command
mutations to overcome the limitations of software-based at-
testation while providing guarantees regarding a device’s
software-integrity.
Machine Learning based Anomaly Detection. The authors
of [42] discussed machine learning proposals for anomaly
detection in the ICS. Also, the authors of [33] proposed to use
convolutional neural networks for detecting cyber attacks on
industrial control systems. Machine learning techniques for
anomaly detection in industrial arm applications is discussed
in [43]. Decision trees used in several security research areas
like anomaly detection in network trafﬁc data [8]. The authors
of [44] used deep learning architecture in correlating Tor con-
nections. The authors of [39] used the k-means clustering to
detect trafﬁc phase shifts inside the SCADA automatically.
In [16], the authors discussed data mining and machine learn-
ing techniques for cybersecurity. There are many successful
applications of machine learning in cyber-physical system
security. PAtt uses the machine learning to learn the physi-
cal behavior alongside the other security measures like the
integrity and authenticity checking of the control logic of the
PLCs. Also, PAtt do not need to see the attack during the
training phase. PAtt do not need to see the attack during the
training phase, and it could detect the attack by a distance met-
ric. Also, unlike most of machine learning anomaly detection
techniques, PAtt is able to identify the replay attack.
Physical Unclonable Functions. The authors of [62] pro-
posed to use the MEMS gyroscope as physical unclonable
function, and they showed the feasibility of using the phys-
ical and electrical properties of the MEMS gyroscope for
cryptographic key generation. The authors of [35] proposed
an attested execution processor that do not need secure non-
volatile memory, and it derives cryptographic identities from
manufacturing variation measured by a PUF. Aging effects in
PUFs have been discussed in the [38, 46], which were dom-
inated by physical effects in the resistors. We evaluated the
aging effect on industrial actuators and sensors used in our
experimental evaluation in the Appendix 10.1, and show that
on the scale of our sensors, no aging effects were observed.
8 Conclusion
In this paper, we presented PAtt, a novel remote attestation
scheme for control processes of industrial control systems
that integrates software-based attestation with physical behav-
ior correlations, similar to a PUF. We used software-based
attestation techniques to ﬁrst generate a fresh hash over the
loaded logic in the PLC, which is then translated into an actu-
ation strategy for the physical process. The resulting sensor
reading traces are then checked by the veriﬁer to ensure that
the correct logic is loaded and to detect spooﬁng of the pro-
cess data. The proposed solution was able to detect the attack
that is not seen before during the training phase of the ver-
iﬁer, and it could measure the anomalies by computing the
distance over a cryptographic hash generated from the attes-
tation of the control process. We implemented our solution
(based on a robotic arm test-bed with Siemens PLC), and
show that our proposed solution is accurate enough to detect
the tested attacks with an accuracy of 97%, sensitivity of 96%,
and Matthews Correlation Coefﬁcient of 0.95 (τ = 0.95 ).
