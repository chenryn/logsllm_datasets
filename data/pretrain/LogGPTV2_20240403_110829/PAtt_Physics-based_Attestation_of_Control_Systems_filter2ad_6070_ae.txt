### Feedback for the Attestation Procedure

In this use case, the critical zone occurs when the printer head is extruding filament, with its path being fixed. Therefore, the attestation procedure can be performed between printing layers, once the printer head is raised to satisfy the spatial requirements of the critical zone. A similar argument applies to subtractive manufacturing applications such as laser engraving or CNC milling. These setups are analogous to 3D printing, featuring precise but relative motion control and an on/off-type process that defines their critical zones. The addition of cost-effective external sensors can enable the attestation of these processes.

#### Remote Attestation
Remote attestation for embedded systems has been studied for many years. However, most existing approaches do not provide real-time execution guarantees during the attestation process [10, 15, 30, 59]. Carpent et al. [13] discuss the fundamental conflict between real-time execution and attestation. Additionally, these approaches often rely on a hardware root-of-trust, which is not available in today's Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). Software-based attestation, while not requiring a root-of-trust [28, 36, 37, 52–54], provides only uncertain security guarantees [55]. Valente et al. propose leveraging control-command variations to validate the correctness of a system’s physical operations rather than its software integrity, providing "weak attestation" [61]. Our proposed scheme combines software-based attestation with control-command mutations to overcome the limitations of software-based attestation while ensuring device software integrity.

#### Machine Learning-Based Anomaly Detection
Machine learning techniques have been widely applied to anomaly detection in Industrial Control Systems (ICS). For instance, [42] discusses machine learning proposals for anomaly detection in ICS, and [33] proposes using convolutional neural networks to detect cyber attacks on industrial control systems. [43] explores machine learning techniques for anomaly detection in industrial arm applications. Decision trees, used in various security research areas like anomaly detection in network traffic data [8], and deep learning architectures, such as those used for correlating Tor connections [44], are also relevant. [39] uses k-means clustering to automatically detect traffic phase shifts in SCADA systems. [16] discusses data mining and machine learning techniques for cybersecurity. PAtt leverages machine learning to learn physical behavior alongside other security measures, such as integrity and authenticity checks of the control logic in Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs). Unlike many machine learning anomaly detection techniques, PAtt does not require prior exposure to an attack during the training phase and can detect attacks using a distance metric. It is also capable of identifying replay attacks.

#### Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs)
[62] proposes using MEMS gyroscopes as PUFs, demonstrating the feasibility of generating cryptographic keys from their physical and electrical properties. [35] introduces an attested execution processor that derives cryptographic identities from manufacturing variations measured by a PUF, without needing secure non-volatile memory. Aging effects in PUFs, primarily due to physical effects in resistors, have been discussed in [38, 46]. We evaluated the aging effect on industrial actuators and sensors used in our experimental setup, as detailed in Appendix 10.1, and found no significant aging effects at the scale of our sensors.

### Conclusion

In this paper, we presented PAtt, a novel remote attestation scheme for control processes in ICS that integrates software-based attestation with physical behavior correlations, akin to a PUF. We used software-based attestation techniques to generate a fresh hash over the loaded logic in the PLC, which is then translated into an actuation strategy for the physical process. The resulting sensor reading traces are checked by the verifier to ensure the correct logic is loaded and to detect spoofing of process data. Our solution can detect attacks not seen during the training phase by computing the distance over a cryptographic hash generated from the attestation of the control process. We implemented our solution using a robotic arm test-bed with a Siemens PLC and demonstrated that it can accurately detect tested attacks with 97% accuracy, 96% sensitivity, and a Matthews Correlation Coefficient of 0.95 (τ = 0.95).
