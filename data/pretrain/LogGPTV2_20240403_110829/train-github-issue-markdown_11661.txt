Hi,  
I used VS Code since it launched, one of the feature i loved so much is the
intellisense while adding a file using require when coding for node js.
After the latest update (Version: 0.10.8, Shell: 0.35.6) require intellisense
is not working at all, it always says 'No suggestions'
Can someone help me to get the intellisense for 'require' command.
