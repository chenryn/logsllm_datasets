There is no way to understand from this log, what is actually problematic, or
to debug it:
    [REQUEST] New used memory 12804659728 [11.9gb] from field [] would be larger than configured breaker: 12804659609 [11.9gb], breaking
I think the minimum is either to print the query/aggregation or at least the
problematic field.
