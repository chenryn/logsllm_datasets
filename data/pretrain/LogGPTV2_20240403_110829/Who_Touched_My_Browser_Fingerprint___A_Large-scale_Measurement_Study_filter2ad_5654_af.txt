browser fingerprinting. For example, Brave Browser [1] provides a
fingerprinting protection mode and Firefox provides Tracking Pro-
tection in its private browsing mode. In addition to browsers, some
browser add-ons, such as Canvas Defender [2], also provide protec-
tions against fingerprinting by adding noises. The research com-
munity also works on anti-fingerprinting works. PriVaricator [33]
adds randomized noise to fingerprinting results so that a tracker
cannot obtain an accurate fingerprint. Deterministic Browser [15],
is similar to Tor Browser, but mostly focuses on and defends against
timing-based fingerprinting. Recently, W3C also introduces a new
group note [7] with several suggested practices to browser vendors
on the mitigation of browser fingerprinting.

Who Touched My Browser Fingerprint?
IMC ’20, October 27–November 29, 2020, Virtual Event, USA
7 CONCLUSION
Browser fingerprints are dynamic, i.e., they evolve over time when
users update browsers and OS, or even just interact with their
browsers. Such fingerprint dynamics will bring inaccuracies for
existing fingerprinting tools to track web users. In this paper, we
perform the first large-scale measurement study on the dynamics
of browser fingerprints by deploying a customized fingerprinting
tool at a real-world website and collecting millions of data over
an eight-month period. We then process the collected raw data by
generating a dynamics dataset with browser instances represented
by browser ID, i.e., a combination of an anonymized version of
username provided by the deployment website and some stable
browser features.
Our results show that fingerprint dynamics can be classified
into three major categories based on their root causes: browser
or OS updates, user actions, and environment updates. Our study
further yield several new insights: (i) fingerprint dynamics may leak
security- or privacy-related information, (ii) prior evolution-aware
fingerprinting tools, e.g., FP-Stalker, perform poorly in a large-scale,
real-world setting, (iii) some unrelated fingerprint features may be
correlated in a piece of dynamics, and (iv) fingerprinting dynamics
can be correlated with real-world events like browser or OS updates.
We also give several pieces of advices to browser vendors and users
on security and privacy as well as evolution-aware fingerprinting
tool developers on improving the linking accuracy and speed.
In the future, we believe that it would be interesting to study
the trade-off between uniqueness and linkability of browser finger-
prints on our large-scale dataset. We would like to design a better
fingerprinting tool that balances these two important metrics in
browser fingerprinting because uniqueness defines to what extent
the tool can track a browser instance and linkability defines how
long the tool can track a browser instance.
