estimating the number of cars using trafﬁc cameras vary
between a few percent to 26%, depending on illumina-
tion, wind, occlusions, etc. [43]. Furthermore, the camera
lenses have to be manually cleaned every 6 weeks to 6
months [16].
• For a city to use Caraoke to deliver the above services,
it needs to connect the system with its own transporta-
tion and trafﬁc databases. For example, in order to de-
tect a car that runs a red light, the city needs to combine
the output of Caraoke with the timing of the red-light at
the corresponding intersection. The process for combining
Caraoke’s output with the city’s transportation and trafﬁc
databases is beyond the scope of this paper.
5. COUNTING DESPITE COLLISIONS
Estimating the number of vehicles at major intersections is
critical for trafﬁc management and city planning. In this sec-
tion, we describe how a Caraoke reader counts the transpon-
ders in its radio range. Speciﬁcally, when a Caraoke reader
transmits a query message, transponders in its radio range
respond simultaneously with their information. We would
like to use the resulting collisions to count the number of
transponders.
At a high level, our approach is simple. We exploit the fact
that two transponders, typically, do not have the same car-
rier frequency, and that their carrier frequency offset (CFO)
is relatively large. In particular, the speciﬁcations of the E-
ZPass transponder show that the device’s CFO can exceed
one MHz [36]. CFO is typically a nuisance for wireless com-
munication systems which have to compensate for CFO be-
fore decoding. In Caraoke however, we leverage CFO for
our advantage to count the number of colliding transpon-
ders. Speciﬁcally, we take the FFT of the collision signal.
Since different transponders have different carrier frequen-
cies, the Fourier transform shows multiple peaks at differ-
ent frequencies that corresponds to the various transponders’
CFOs. Fig. 4 shows the Fourier transform of a collision sig-
nal where ﬁve e-toll transponders transmitted at the same
time. As can be seen in the ﬁgure, there are ﬁve peaks, each
corresponds to one of ﬁve colliding transponders.
This shows that one way for counting the transponders
would be to take an FFT of the collision signal and count the
peaks in the Fourier domain. To understand the performance
of this estimator, we need to tie it to the resolution of the

received wireless signal can be written as:
y(t) = h · s(t) · ej2π·fc·t,
(2)
where h is the complex channel coefﬁcient. The receiver
down-converts the signal to baseband by multiplying it
with its own carrier frequency. The received baseband sig-
nal r(t) then becomes:
r(t) = h · s(t) · ej2π·∆f·t
= h · (0.5 + s′(t)) · ej2π·∆f·t,
(3)
(4)
where ∆f is the carrier frequency offset between the trans-
mitter and and the receiver, and s′(t) is the same square-
wave as s(t) except that it toggles between -0.5 and 0.5
and has zero mean. The frequency representation of the
received signal r(t) can be written as:
R(f ) =
h
2 · δ(f − ∆f ) + h · S′(f − ∆f )
(5)
where S′(f ) is the frequency representation of s′(t) and
δ(f ) is the unit impulse function. As it can be seen from
the equation, this signal has a peak at the carrier frequency
offset, ∆f . Further, since s′(t) has a zero mean, S′(0) =
0.6 Thus, the complex value of the peak represents the
channel from transmitter to receiver i.e., R(∆f ) = h
2 .
4. CARAOKE OVERVIEW
Caraoke is a networked system that enables query-
response communication between a Caraoke reader and the
e-toll transponders in its range. At the heart of Caraoke is
a new device that we call the Caraoke reader; it counts, lo-
calizes, and decodes transponders’ ids from their signal col-
lisions. It also estimates the speeds of the cars carrying the
transponders. The Caraoke reader harnesses its power from
solar energy and has an LTE modem to connect to the In-
ternet. Hence, it can be easily deployed without the need for
additional infrastructure. As shown in Fig. 3, smart cities can
deploy Caraoke readers on street-lamps to support a variety
of smart services including: 1) trafﬁc monitoring, 2) speed
enforcement, 3) red-light running, 4) smart street-parking,
and even 4) allowing a user who forgets where he parked to
query the system to locate his parked car.
6s′(t) has a zero mean because s(t) is an on-off keying signal
with Manchester encoding , and s′(t) is the same as s(t) but
shifted by -0.5.
300FFT and whether it can distinguish the differences between
the CFOs of the transponders. The resolution of the FFT, δf
refers to the width of each FFT bin and can be written as:
δf =
1
T
(6)
where T is the FFT time window. Since the length of the
transponder’s response is 512µs, the maximum FFT window
is T = 512µs and hence the resolution of the FFT is δf =
1.95 kHz. Thus, if two transponders have carrier frequencies
that differ by less than 1.95 kHz, their peaks will fall into
the same FFT bin and will be counted as one. Given that the
CFO range is 1.2 MHz, the peak of a transponder can fall
in any of N = 1.2 MHz/1.95 kHz = 615 FFT bins. If m
transponders collide, then the probability of not missing any
transponder by counting FFT peaks is:
P(not missing any transponder) = (cid:0)N
m(cid:1) · m!
Nm
(7)
Unfortunately this probability decreases quickly as more
transponders are in range. The probability of not missing any
transponder is 98%, 93% and 73% for m = 5, 10 and 20 cars,
respectively. The above derivations shows that an estimator
that simply counts the number of peaks in the FFT is accept-
able at low car density but can easily miss some cars when
the number of cars in range is large.
So, how can we improve the quality of our estimate in sce-
narios of high densities? To overcome this problem, Caraoke
distinguishes whether one or more transponders have fallen
into the same FFT bin while counting the number of peaks.
It does this by leveraging the phase rotation property of the
Fourier transform, which says that a shift in the time domain
translates into phase rotation in the frequency domain:
F{r(t)} = R(f )
F{r(t + τ )} = R(f ) · ej2π·f τ
(8)
where r(t) is the signal in time domain and R(f ) is its fre-
quency representation. Speciﬁcally, if the FFT peak contains
a single transponder’s response, then performing the FFT on
the same signal with a time shift τ causes only a phase ro-
tation of the peak value but the magnitude of the peak does
not change. In other words, kR(f )k = kR(f )· ej2π·f τk, where
R(f ) is the frequency representation of the received signal.
In contrast, say the CFOs of two transponders, f and f ′, fall
into the same FFT bin, then the value of the peak in that bin
without a time-shift is R(f ) + R(f ′) while its value with a
time-shift of τ is R(f )· ej2π·f τ + R(f ′)· ej2π·f ′ τ . Since the fre-
quencies are slightly different, they rotate by different phases
and results in a change in the magnitude of the peak.
The above provides us with a mechanism to determine
whether an FFT bin has one or more transponders. To do so,
we compare the magnitude of the FFT bin with and without
a time-shift. If the two magnitudes are different by more than
a noise threshold, then multiple transponders have fallen into
that bin. In the following, we explain how this detection sig-
niﬁcantly improves the probability of getting a correct count.

determine the number of cars in range. However, there is a
possibility that two cars have fallen into the same bin. Hence,
Caraoke considers the peaks with two or more transponders’
signals as two cars when it is counting the peak. Speciﬁ-
cally, if an FFT peak includes a single frequency, Caraoke
counts it as one car and if it has two or more frequencies,
it counts it as two cars. Hence, the result of counting will
be incorrect only when there is at least a bin which includes
three or more cars. In another word, the probability of not
missing any transponder is equal to one minus the probabil-
ity of having at least one FFT bin which includes three or
more transponders’ signal. For m colliding transponders and
N FFT bins in the 1.2 MHz range, this probability becomes:
P(not missing any transponder)
= 1 − P( ∃ bin with ≥ 3 transponders)
≥ 1 − Xi∈{1,...,N}
≥ 1 −(cid:18)N
1(cid:19)(cid:18)m
P(bin i with ≥ 3 transponders)

(9)
Substituting N = 615, the probability of not missing any
transponder is at least 99.9%, 99.9% and 99.7% for m = 5,
10 and 20. Thus, having the capability to detect the peaks
that have two or more transponder’s signals signiﬁcantly im-
proves the probability of correctly counting the cars.
Finally, note that for simplicity, our analysis has assumed
a uniform distribution for CFO. However, we have also ex-
perimentally validated our solution for empirical CFO mea-
surements collected from 155 different transponders.7 Our
empirical results show that the probability of not missing any
transponder is 99.9%, 99.5% and 95.3% for m = 5, 10 and
20 which are slightly worse than analytical-results.
6. LOCALIZING E-TOLL TRANSPONDERS
Car localization is an essential function for multiple
smart services such as smart parking and detecting red-
light runners. The ﬁrst step in localizing cars is to local-
ize the transponder located on cars’ windshield. To do so,
Caraoke ﬁrst calculates the angle at which the signal from

the transponder arrives at the Caraoke reader. This angle in-
dicates the spatial angle between the transponder and reader,
and typically referred to as the angle-of-arrival (AoA).
In order to measure the AoA, a Caraoke reader uses two
antennas separated by a distance d. It is widely-known that
the angle of arrival can be computed as [60]:
cos α =
∆φ
2π
λ
d
,
(10)
where α is the spatial angle between the transponder and the
reader, shown in Fig. 5, ∆φ is the phase difference between
the two antennas (i.e. ∆φ = φ2 − φ1), and λ is the carrier
wavelength 8.
To compute α, we need to substitute the value of the other
parameters in Eq. 10. While d and λ are known, ∆φ should
be measured. In the absence of collisions, ∆φ can be mea-
sured directly between the signals received by the two anten-
nas on the reader:
∆φ = ∠
r2(t)
r1(t)
= ∠
h2 · s(t) · ej2π∆f·t
h1 · s(t) · ej2π∆f·t = ∠
h2
h1
,
where r1(t) and r2(t) are baseband signals received by the
ﬁrst and second antenna, respectively, h1 and h2 are the chan-
nels to the two antennas, s(t) is the transmitted baseband
signal and ∆f is the CFO between the transmitter and re-
ceiver9. However, since in Caraoke reader each antenna re-
ceives a collision from multiple transponders, such a direct
measurement does not work. This is due to the fact that the
received signal is the summation of responses from multiple
transponders while each has its own channel. Thus, the re-
ceived signal at each antenna when m transponders respond
can be written as:
r1(t) = r11(t) + r12(t) + ··· + r1m(t)
r2(t) = r21(t) + r22(t) + ··· + r2m(t),
(11)
where r1i(t) and r2i(t) are the received signal from the ith
transponder to the ﬁrst and second antenna, respectively. As
8Note that since Caraoke reader is placed outdoor on a high
pole like a street lamp, it has a strong line-of-sight path
to the transponder and the multipath effects which occur
in standard indoor environments are signiﬁcantly weaker.
Hence, Caraoke does not require a large antenna array to es-
timate the angle of arrival. In §12, we empirically show that
Caraoke does not suffer from multipath effects.
9Note that the received signals on the two antennas experi-
ence the same CFO since the antennas are connected to the
same oscillator on the Caraoke reader.

three antennas arranged in an equilateral triangle to achieve
higher accuracy in calculating spatial angle of transponder.

degrees regardless of transponder location

Fortunately, however, we can use the same trick we used
for counting the transponders. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst take
the FFT of the collision at each antenna and identify the
peaks, where each peak corresponds to the response from
one transponder. For each peak in the ﬁrst antenna’s signal,
the phase value is compared to the phase value of the same
peak in the other antenna’s signal. These phase differences
are used to calculate the spatial angle α for each transpon-
der. Mathematically, the above approach works because the
Fourier transform is linear, i.e.:
F{ax(t) + by(t)} = aX(f ) + bY(f )
(12)
Using the above property, the frequency representation of the
received signal at the antennas when m transponders respond
can be written as:
R1(f ) = R11(f ) + R12(f ) + ··· + R1m(f )
R2(f ) = R21(f ) + R22(f ) + ··· + R2m(f )
(13)
where R1i(f ) and R2i(f ) are frequency representation of the
received signals from the ith transponder to the ﬁrst and sec-
ond antenna, respectively. As it was explained in §3, the re-
ceived signal from each transponder has a peak at its CFO
where the value of the peak represents the channel coefﬁcient
(i.e. R(∆fi) = h
2 ). Hence, R1(f ) and R2(f ) signals have multi-
ple peaks where each peak corresponds to the response from
only one transponder. Therefore, the ∆φ for the transponder
i can be calculated as follow:
∆φ = ∠
R2(∆fi)
R1(∆fi)
= ∠
h2i
h1i
where ∆fi is the CFO of transponder i, and R2(f ) and R1(f )
are frequency representation of the received signal at the
the ﬁrst and second antennas. Substituting the measured ∆φ
in Eq. 10, we can compute the spatial angle between the
transponder and reader (i.e. AoA).
The above equation allows us to compute the spatial angle
from the reader to the transponder. We can however improve
