### Expected Behavior
`remote.screen` has EventEmitter methods such as `on` defined, to listen to
screen events such as `display-added`
### Actual Behavior
`remote.screen` does not have any defined EventEmitter methods
### To Reproduce
In the devtools, inspect `require('electron').remote.screen` and notice that
it does not have the `on` method defined
### Additional Information
There was a PR to address other `remote.screen` methods not being defined that
was merged in 11.0.3 (#26660), but it did not seem to address this bug
