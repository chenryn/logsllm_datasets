## Who We Are
- **360 Technology** is a leading Internet security company in China, known for its anti-virus security software for PCs and mobile devices.
- **UnicornTeam** (https://unicorn.360.com/), established in 2014, specializes in the security of various telecommunication systems.
- **Notable Works:**
  - Low-cost GPS spoofing research (DEFCON 23)
  - LTE redirection attack (DEFCON 24)
  - Attack on power line communication (BlackHat USA 2016)

## Voice Solutions in LTE Networks
- **VoLTE (Voice over LTE)**
  - Based on IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS)
  - The ultimate goal of network evolution
- **CSFB (Circuit Switched Fallback)**
  - Switches from 4G to 3G or 2G for voice calls
- **SV-LTE (Simultaneous Voice and LTE)**
  - Higher cost and increased power consumption on the terminal

## Normal 2G Call vs. CSFB
- **2G Call:**
  - AKA (Authentication and Key Agreement) is performed for every call.
- **CSFB:**
  - No authentication step is present, making it vulnerable.

## Vulnerability in CSFB
- **Principle:**
  - An attacker can bypass the GSM badge by entering through the LTE door and shouting "I must be as quick as possible!" to gain access.
- **Exploitation:**
  - **Basic Idea:**
    - Since CSFB lacks an authentication procedure, attackers can send a Paging Response on the 2G network, impersonating the victim, and hijack the call link.

## Experiment Environment
- **Hardware:**
  - C118
  - OsmocomBB L1
  - OsmocomBB L2/3

## Exploitation I – Random Hijack
- **Attack Steps:**
  1. Listen on the PCH channel
  2. Extract TMSI/IMSI from the paging message
  3. Forge a paging response with the extracted TMSI/IMSI
  4. Check if the MSC accepts the forged paging response

## Why Network Sends Paging on 2G
- **Scenario:**
  - The cellphone remains in 4G, but the network sends a paging message using 4G’s S-TMSI.
  - In some cases, the network sends paging messages on both 4G and 2G.
  - Using the TMSI captured on 2G, the attacker can respond to the CSFB call on 4G.

## Hijack Result
- **Outcome:**
  - C118 (without a SIM card) successfully hijacked a call from 139920.

## Further Exploitation
- **Attacker's Capabilities:**
  - Can answer incoming calls, leading to abnormal voice recognition by the caller.
  - Knows the victim’s TMSI or IMSI and the caller’s phone number.
- **Advanced Exploitation:**
  - **Get Victim’s Phone Number:**
    - During an ongoing call, sending a 'CM Service Request' does not trigger authentication, allowing the attacker to make a call to another in-hand phone and obtain the victim’s ISDN number.

## Targeted Persistent Attack
- **Using TMSI:**
  - **Condition:** Attacker knows the victim’s TMSI
  - **Steps:**
    1. Persistently send Paging Responses with the TMSI
    2. Quickly control the link when the victim has a paging procedure.
- **Using IMSI:**
  - **Condition:** Attacker knows the victim’s IMSI
  - **Steps:**
    1. Persistently send Paging Responses with the IMSI
    2. Control the link when the victim has a paging procedure.
  - **Disadvantage:** Increased latency due to the need to find the corresponding TMSI.
- **Using ISDN Number:**
  - **Condition:** Attacker knows the victim’s ISDN number
  - **Steps:**
    1. Make a call to the victim to trigger a CSFB and capture the TMSI.
    2. Use another C118 to continuously send Paging Responses with the TMSI and make a second call to trigger CSFB again.
    3. Hijack and hold the victim’s link.

## Advanced Exploitation – Attack Internet Accounts
- **Login with Verification SMS:**
  - Some applications allow login with a cellphone number and verification SMS, without requiring a password.
- **Reset Login Password with Verification SMS:**
  - Attackers can initiate a password reset procedure and hijack the verification SMS.
- **Example:**
  - C118 received the SMS sent from Facebook to the victim.

## Special Points of Ghost Telephonist
- **Victim’s Cellphone:**
  - Remains online in 4G and does not sense the attack.
- **Attacker:**
  - Only needs a fake 2G UE and does not require a fake 4G base station.

## Different Behaviors from Different Terminals
- **Observations:**
  - Some cellphones are easily hijacked, while others are not.
  - Cellphones with better defense mechanisms may require jamming to cut off the connection.

## Failure Analysis
- **Successful Hijack:**
  - After the attacker sends a Paging Response and receives the call.
- **Link Holding:**
  - The call may be interrupted if the victim’s cellphone launches a Location Area Update (LUA) procedure in 2G, breaking the attacker’s link.

## Fast Return Cases
- **Case 1: Mi4C Cellphone (Qualcomm Chipset)**
  - Paging Response failure
  - Location Update not completed
- **Case 2: Qiku Cellphone (MTK Chipset)**
  - Paging Response failure
  - Location Update completed

## Jamming on the Victim
- **Effect:**
  - Breaks the link between the victim and the network, allowing the attacker to maintain the fake link.
- **Disadvantage:**
  - The victim may sense the attack.

## Countermeasures
- **For Operators:**
  - Improve the CSFB authentication procedure.
  - Accelerate VoLTE service deployment.
- **For Internet Service Providers:**
  - Be aware that PSTN authentication is not secure.
  - Enhance password reset procedures with additional personal information checks.

## GSMA CVD Program
- **Program Overview:**
  - Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure Programme
  - Focuses on open standards-based technologies used across the mobile industry.
- **Acknowledgment:**
  - UnicornTeam received the first acknowledgment on the Mobile Security Research Hall of Fame.
  - GSMA transferred vulnerability information to all operators, who are now fixing or have fixed the issue.
