ABSTRACT
DNS is one of the most essential components of the Internet, map-
ping domain names to the IP addresses behind almost every online
service. Domain names are therefore also a fundamental tool for
attackers to quickly locate and relocate their malicious activities
on the Internet. In this paper, we design and evaluate Premadoma,
a solution for DNS registries to predict malicious intent well be-
fore a domain name becomes operational. In contrast to blacklists,
which only offer protection after some harm has already been
done, this system can prevent domain names from being used be-
fore they can pose any threats. We advance the state of the art by
leveraging recent insights into the ecosystem of malicious domain
registrations, focusing explicitly on facilitators employed for bulk
registration and similarity patterns in registrant information. We
thoroughly evaluate the proposed prediction model’s performance
and adaptability on an 11 month testing set, and address complex
and domain-specific dataset challenges. Moreover, we have success-
fully deployed Premadoma in the production environment of the
.eu ccTLD registry to detect and prevent malicious registrations,
and have contributed to the take down of 58,966 registrations in
2018.
