Assistant: To install Docker: 1. Install the Docker local client, download the installation package, and follow the installation wizard to complete the installation. 2. Verify the installation: Run the docker version command on the terminal. If the Docker version information is output, it means that the Docker installation is successful. Install Kubernetes: 1. Install and configure Kubernetes infrastructure, including Master nodes and Worker nodes. 2. Install and configure the kubectl command-line tool. 3. Execute the kubectl init command to initialize the cluster. 4. Create a Token for the Worker node and add it to the Cluster. 5. Verify the installation of Kubernetes: Run the kubectl get nodes command on the terminal. If the node information is output, it means that Kubernetes is installed successfully. Note that before installation, you should first understand the installation dependencies of the software, the version and compatibility of the operating system, and the hardware and network environment of the cluster.
