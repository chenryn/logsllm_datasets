User: How can I select which Python version to use for a WebJob on Microsoft Azure?
When I do print(sys.version) I get 2.7.8 (default, Jun 30 2014, 16:03:49) [MSC v.1500 32 bit (Intel)]
Where can I specify another version? I would like to use Python 3 for some jobs.
I have tried adding runtime.txt reading python-3.4 to the root path, but it had no effect.
Assistant: Also if you wanna run different python versions in the same site, you can always drop a run.cmd that calls the right version of python for you. They are installed in D:\Python34 and D:\Python27
