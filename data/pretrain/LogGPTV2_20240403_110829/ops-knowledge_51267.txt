User: How to perform a TCP-based port scan?
Assistant: Performing TCP-based port scanning requires the use of specialized tools such as Nmap. The following are the steps to perform a TCP-based port scan: 1. Download and install the Nmap tool. 2. Open a terminal or command prompt window. 3. Enter the following command: `nmap -sS <target IP>`, where `<target IP>` is the IP address of the target host to scan. 4. Press the Enter key to start scanning. The program will automatically scan all TCP ports on the target host and display the scan results on the screen. 5. If you wish to scan a specific port or port range, use the following command: `nmap -sS -p <port number/range> <destination IP>`. For example, if you want to scan ports 80 and 443 on the target host, you can enter the following command: `nmap -sS -p 80,443 <destination IP>`. 6. After the scan is complete, you can assess the security and vulnerability of the target host based on the scan results, and take measures to strengthen security.
