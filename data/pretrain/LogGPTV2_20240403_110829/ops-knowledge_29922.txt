User: Basically I am coding websites in PHP from last year.
But now I want to use something else and GAE looks a good option.
So I want to know if GAE is good for making a little website to share favorite youtube videos ?
I have done single website in Python+Django few months back, it looks good to me.
But JAVA is the language that I want to learn too (never coded in JAVA since School days ).
Phew, it is hard to choose, so I need opinions !!
Specifically : Want to know if any glitch/problem in using either python or Java under GAE. Or if GAE is preferred or not. Not gonna make website for learning only, it will be for a client.
Assistant: If you want to learn Java, then use Java! 
If you feel that Java is too verbose compared to Python, you could try Scala, which runs on the JVM like Java. Scala is more concise and well designed.
