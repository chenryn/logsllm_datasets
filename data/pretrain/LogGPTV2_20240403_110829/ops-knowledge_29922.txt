I have been coding websites in PHP for the past year, but I am now considering using a different platform. Google App Engine (GAE) seems like a promising option. I would like to know if GAE is suitable for creating a small website to share favorite YouTube videos.

A few months ago, I developed a website using Python and Django, which I found to be quite effective. However, I am also interested in learning Java, as I haven't coded in it since my school days. It's challenging to decide between these options, so I would appreciate some opinions.

Specifically, I want to know if there are any issues or glitches when using either Python or Java on GAE. Additionally, I would like to understand if GAE is generally recommended for such projects. This website will be for a client, not just for learning purposes.

Assistant: If you are interested in learning Java, then using Java on GAE could be a great opportunity to gain practical experience with the language. However, if you find Java to be too verbose compared to Python, you might consider using Scala, which runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and is known for its conciseness and well-designed syntax. Both Java and Scala are supported on GAE and can be good choices depending on your preferences and project requirements.
