### Analysis of Latencies and Throughput in Quantum Network Simulations

#### Latency Analysis
Figures 11-16 illustrate the scaled latencies and request latencies as functions of simulated time for 20 initial long simulation runs, employing different scenarios of mixed request types. These figures provide a detailed view of how various request types (e.g., Uniform, MoreNL, MoreCK, MoreMD, NoNLMoreCK, NoNLMoreMD) affect latency under different conditions.

- **Figure 11**: Latencies for Uniform requests.
- **Figure 12**: Latencies for MoreNL requests.
- **Figure 13**: Latencies for MoreCK requests.
- **Figure 14**: Latencies for MoreMD requests.
- **Figure 15**: Latencies for NoNLMoreCK requests.
- **Figure 16**: Latencies for NoNLMoreMD requests.

When using First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) scheduling, the request latencies for different types are highly correlated, as all requests share the same queue. However, the scaled latency for different request priorities, particularly MD, deviates from others due to the varying number of pairs in the requests.

#### Throughput Analysis
Figures 17-22 present the throughput as a function of simulated time for the same 20 runs. The type of scheduler has a relatively small impact on throughput in these simulated scenarios.

- **Figure 17**: Throughputs for Uniform requests.
- **Figure 18**: Throughputs for MoreNL requests.
- **Figure 19**: Throughputs for MoreCK requests.
- **Figure 20**: Throughputs for MoreMD requests.
- **Figure 21**: Throughputs for NoNLMoreCK requests.
- **Figure 22**: Throughputs for NoNLMoreMD requests.

We also conducted a second batch of simulations with the same scenarios, which produced similar results.

#### Data Summary
Tables 3 and 4 summarize the average throughputs, scaled latencies, and request latencies for the 20 simulation runs.

**Table 3: Average Throughputs**
- This table lists the average throughputs for 20 simulation scenarios, calculated as the number of pairs per maximum simulated time (tsim_max). The tsim_max ranges from 93 to 2355 seconds, with each run lasting 24 hours of wall time.

**Table 4: Average Scaled Latencies (SL) and Request Latencies (RL)**
- This table provides the average scaled latencies and request latencies for the 20 simulation scenarios. Values in parentheses are estimates of standard errors, computed as \( \frac{s_n}{\sqrt{n}} \), where \( s_n \) is the sample standard deviation and \( n \) is the number of data points used for averaging.
