  * Electron version: 1.21
  * Operating system: OS X 10.11.2 (15C50)
Electron is called by VMD:
    $ vmd --versions
    vmd:       1.26.2
    electron:  1.2.1
    node:      6.1.0
    chrome:    51.0.2704.63
    v8:        5.1.281.47
    openssl:   1.0.2h
    zlib:      1.2.8
I'm having trouble reproducing it outside my environment for you. The short
version is, Emacs has a VMD preview mode, which ultimately shells out to VMD,
which calls Electron like this:
    /usr/local/lib/node_modules/vmd/node_modules/electron-prebuilt/dist/Electron.app/Contents/MacOS/Electron  /usr/local/lib/node_modules/vmd/main/main.js /tmp/vmd-preview
I'm hoping the stack trace is enough to identify the issue:
