Question: "Imagine you are designing an authentication system for an Android device that leverages a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). You decide to implement a subsystem similar to Gatekeeper for device pattern/password authentication. Your design must include the following components: a service to handle platform-independent logic, a hardware abstraction layer interface, and a TEE-based implementation. Which of the following component sets correctly represents the necessary parts of the Gatekeeper-like subsystem, adhering to the roles and responsibilities specified in the architecture?"
 "A": "Authentication Service, Gatekeeper Hardware Abstractor (GHA), TEE Gatekeeper"
 "B": "gatekeeperd, Gatekeeper Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL), Gatekeeper (TEE)"
 "C": "Authentication Daemon, Gatekeeper Hardware Integration Layer (GHIL), Secure Gatekeeper"
 "D": "gatekeeperd, Gatekeeper Hardware Interface (GHI), Trusty Gatekeeper"
Answer: B
