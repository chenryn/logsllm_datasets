Question: A Windows 10 enterprise environment is considering implementing the Blocking Untrusted Fonts feature to improve security. If the feature is turned on, what could be the potential implications for the network and users?
"A": "All fonts, including those in the '%windir%/Fonts' directory, will be blocked from loading.",
"B": "Fonts installed outside of the '%windir%/Fonts' directory will be blocked, potentially impacting the rendering of websites and documents that rely on untrusted fonts.",
"C": "The feature will prevent any font, trusted or untrusted, from being logged in the event log, reducing visibility into font usage.",
"D": "Print jobs sent to a remote printer server that does not exclude the spooler process may not print fonts not available in the server's '%windir%/Fonts' folder."
