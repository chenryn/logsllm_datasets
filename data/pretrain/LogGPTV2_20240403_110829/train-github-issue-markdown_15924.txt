Hi. Please see the question I have made here for a description of the problem.
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34546446/flattening-typescript-typings-or-
interfaces
Here's the post:
As a TypeScript developer, I have become too used to "Duplicate identifier"
issues when working with `.d.ts` files.
Most recently, this occurred because I needed both the typings (`.d.ts` files)
of Angular 2, and Parse.
Angular 2 doesn't distribute their `.d.ts` files through `DefinitelyTyped`, so
I had to fetch Angular 2 through NPM which includes the source files as well.
Now, Parse's `.d.ts` come from `DefinitelyTyped`. Fine - so far, so good.
The issue then arises because both of these libraries depend on Node JS
typings. The Node JS typings of Parse are located in the `typings` folder,
whereas the Node JS typings of Angular 2 are located in a subfolder under
`node_modules/angular2`.
This gives me a huge amount of duplicate identifier issues when compiling.
### So, the big question(s)
\- Can I flatten `.d.ts` files so that it doesn't have duplicates somehow? \-
Can I somehow make the TypeScript compiler ignore duplicate interface
definitions?
