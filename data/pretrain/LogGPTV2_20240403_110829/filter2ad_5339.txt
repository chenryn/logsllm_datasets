Abstract. Current Network Behavior Analysis (NBA) techniques are
based on anomaly detection principles and therefore subject to high error
rates. We propose a mechanism that deploys trust modeling, a technique for
cooperator modeling from the multi-agent research, to improve the quality
of NBA results. Our system is designed as a set of agents, each of them based
on an existing anomaly detection algorithm coupled with a trust model
based on the same traﬃc representation. These agents minimize the error
rate by unsupervised, multi-layer integration of traﬃc classiﬁcation. The
system has been evaluated on real traﬃc in Czech academic networks.1
Network Behavior Analysis attempts to detect the attacks against computer
systems by analyzing the network traﬃc (ﬂow/session) statistics. We present a
mechanism that eﬃciently combines several anomaly detection algorithms in or-
der to signiﬁcantly reduce their error rate, especially in terms of false positives.
The mechanism is based on extended trust modeling, a method from the
multi-agent ﬁeld [1], which generalizes traditional trust modeling by introduc-
tion of generalized identities and situation representation. The traditional trust
models are principally used to identify dishonest partners engaged in repetitive
interactions, such as supply chain management.
Traditionally, the alerts from multiple sources are grouped to improve the
quality of classiﬁcation and reduce the number of events presented to the user [2].
Other approaches concentrate on the improvement of several distinct intrusion
detection methods, diﬀerentiated by the set of traﬃc features these methods
work on [3]. In our work [4], we extend the latter by introducing the collective
extended trust modeling as a supplementary layer which further improves the
quality of classiﬁcation.
The system (Fig. 1) receives the ﬂow data in batches, typically covering be-
tween 2-5 minutes of network traﬃc. The data is processed by several anomaly

detection algorithms, and each algorithm determines an anomaly value for
each of the ﬂows. The anomaly value is a real number in the [0, 1] interval, with
the values close to 0 corresponding to normal ﬂows and the values around 1
being reserved for anomalous ﬂows.
The anomalies provided by individual anomaly detectors are averaged to ob-
tain a single joint anomaly for each ﬂows. At this stage, our algorithm diﬀer-
entiates from the existing approaches by introducing another processing layer,
based on extended trust modeling. Flow description and joint anomaly value is
processed by several trust models. Each of these models represents the ﬂows in a
distinct feature space, aggregates them into clusters, and assigns trustfulness
to these clusters. The trustfulness of the cluster (again in the [0, 1] interval) is
aggregated from the joint anomaly of the ﬂows (from all past data sets) that
were previously assigned to the cluster.
The system than uses the trustfulness provided for each ﬂow (aggregated from
the trustfulness of the close clusters) as its output. Use of trustfulness in lieu of
single-ﬁle dependent anomaly, together with the order-weighted combination of
the results between the models, ﬁlters most of the false positives, and signiﬁcantly
reduces the error rate of the mechanism.
We validate [4] our technique on the NetFlow data from the university network
(with botnet/P2P traﬃc, buﬀer overﬂow attempts) and empirically show that
its use successfully reduces the rate of false positives, while not impacting the
false negatives ratio. The false positives are reduced by the factor of 10-20 when
compared to the individual anomaly detection methods, and by the factor of 2-4
when compared to joint anomalies.
