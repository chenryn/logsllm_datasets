seconds_in_wait is the number of seconds spent in the current wait condition. If 
wait_time has a nonzero value,
seconds_in_wait is the number of seconds that 
have elapsed 
since the start of the last wait. You can get the active seconds thathave elapsed

calculating
seconds_in_wait
- wait_time / 100. |  |
