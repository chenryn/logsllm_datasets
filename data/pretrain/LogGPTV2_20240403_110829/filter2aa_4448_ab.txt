面上有许多本和 Perl有关的好书，详情请见下面一节的介绍。
.PP
Tutorial documents are included in current or upcoming Perl releases
include perltoot for objects or perlboot for a beginner's
approach to objects, perlopentut for file opening semantics,
perlreftut for managing references, perlretut for regular
expressions, perlthrtut for threads, perldebtut for debugging,
and perlxstut for linking C and Perl together.  There may be more
by the time you read this.  The following URLs might also be of

.Sh "USENET上有哪些专门讨论 Perl的新闻讨论群？问题该投到哪里？"
.IX Subsection "What are the Perl newsgroups on Usenet?  Where do I post questions?"
Usenet 中有多个新闻组与 Perl 语言相关：
.PP
.Vb 5
\&    comp.lang.perl.announce             Moderated announcement group
\&    comp.lang.perl.misc                 High traffic general Perl discussion
\&    comp.lang.perl.moderated        Moderated discussion group
\&    comp.lang.perl.modules              Use and development of Perl modules
\&    comp.lang.perl.tk                   Using Tk (and X) from Perl
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    comp.infosystems.www.authoring.cgi  Writing CGI scripts for the Web.
.Ve
.PP
Some years ago, comp.lang.perl was divided into those groups, and
comp.lang.perl itself officially removed.  While that group may still
be found on some news servers, it is unwise to use it, because
postings there will not appear on news servers which honour the
official list of group names.  Use comp.lang.perl.misc for topics
which do not have a more-appropriate specific group.
.PP
There is also a Usenet gateway to Perl mailing lists sponsored by
perl.org at nntp://nntp.perl.org , a web interface to the same lists
at http://nntp.perl.org/group/ and these lists are also available
under the \f(CW\*(C`perl.*\*(C'\fR hierarchy at http://groups.google.com . Other
groups are listed at http://lists.perl.org/ ( also known as
http://lists.cpan.org/ ).
.PP
A nice place to ask questions is the PerlMonks site, 
http://www.perlmonks.org/ , or the Perl Beginners mailing list
http://lists.perl.org/showlist.cgi?name=beginners .
.PP
Note that none of the above are supposed to write your code for you:
asking questions about particular problems or general advice is fine,
but asking someone to write your code for free is not very cool.
.Sh "如果我想投程式原始码，该投到哪个板子上？"
.IX Subsection "Where should I post source code?"
您应看程式的性质来决定该丢到哪个板子上，但也欢迎您交叉投递一份到 comp.lang.perl.misc上头去。如果您打算交叉投递到 alt.sources 的话，请务必遵照该板所规定的标准，包括标头的 Followup-To 栏不可将 alt.sources 列入； 详见该板的 FAQ 。
.PP
If you're just looking for software, first use Google
( http://www.google.com ), Google's usenet search interface
( http://groups.google.com ),  and \s-1CPAN\s0 Search ( http://search.cpan.org ).
This is faster and more productive than just posting a request.
.Sh "Perl 书籍"
.IX Subsection "Perl Books"
市面上有许多有关 Perl 和／或 CGI程式设计的书。其中有些很好，有些还过得去，但也有不少根本不值得买。大部分的 Perl书都列在 Tom Christiansen 所维护的列表中，其中一些有详细的评论，位于 http://www.perl.com/perl/critiques/index.html .
.PP
毫无争议地，最权威的 Perl参考书要数以下这本，由 Perl的创始者著作，现在是第三版 (July 2000)：
.PP
.Vb 5
\&    Programming Perl (the "Camel Book"):
\&        by Larry Wall, Tom Christiansen, and Jon Orwant
\&        0-596-00027-8  [3rd edition July 2000]
\&        http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/pperl3/
\&    (English, translations to several languages are also available)

.PP
The companion volume to the Camel containing thousands
of real-world examples, mini\-tutorials, and complete programs is:

.Vb 5
\&    The Perl Cookbook (the "Ram Book"):
\&        by Tom Christiansen and Nathan Torkington,
\&            with Foreword by Larry Wall
\&        ISBN 1-56592-243-3 [1st Edition August 1998]
\&        http://perl.oreilly.com/catalog/cookbook/

If you're already a seasoned programmer, then the Camel Book might
suffice for you to learn Perl from.  If you're not, check out the
Llama book:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    Learning Perl (the "Llama Book")
\&        by Randal L. Schwartz and Tom Phoenix

\&        http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/lperl3/
.Ve
.PP
And for more advanced information on writing larger programs,
presented in the same style as the Llama book, continue your education
with the Alpaca book:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    Learning Perl Objects, References, and Modules (the "Alpaca Book")
\&       by Randal L. Schwartz, with Tom Phoenix (foreword by Damian Conway)

\&       http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/lrnperlorm/

If you're not an accidental programmer, but a more serious and
possibly even degreed computer scientist who doesn't need as much
hand-holding as we try to provide in the Llama, please check out the
delightful book

Addison-Wesley ( http://www.awlonline.com/ ) and Manning

such as \fIObject Oriented Programming with Perl\fR by Damian Conway and
