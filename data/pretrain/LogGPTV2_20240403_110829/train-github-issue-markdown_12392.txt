Subject: Interest in Contributing to Dockerizing Deno

Hello,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to inquire about any existing plans or ongoing projects aimed at dockerizing Deno. If such an initiative has not yet been undertaken, I would be very interested in contributing to its development.

Best regards,
