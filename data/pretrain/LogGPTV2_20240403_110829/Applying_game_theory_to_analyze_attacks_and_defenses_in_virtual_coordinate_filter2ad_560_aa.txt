Abstract—Virtual coordinate systems provide an accurate and
efﬁcient service that allows hosts on the Internet to determine
latency to arbitrary hosts based on information provided by a
subset of participating nodes. Unfortunately, the accuracy of
the service can be severely impacted by compromised nodes
providing misleading information.
We deﬁne and use a game theory framework in order to
identify the best attack and defense strategies assuming that
the attacker is aware of the defense mechanisms. Our approach
leverages concepts derived from the Nash equilibrium to model
more powerful adversaries. We consider attacks that target the
latency estimation (inﬂation, deﬂation, oscillation) and defense
mechanisms that combine outlier detection with control theory to
deter adaptive adversaries. We apply the game theory framework
to demonstrate the impact and efﬁciency of these attack and
defense strategies using a well-known virtual coordinate system
and real-life Internet data sets.

I. INTRODUCTION
Numerous peer-to-peer (P2P) applications (e.g., BitTorrent,
Skype) can leverage network topology information to optimize
their performance. In order to avoid the costs associated
with actively monitoring all of the nodes in the network,
virtual coordinate systems provide a service that allows hosts
on the Internet to accurately estimate the latency between
arbitrary hosts with minimal network overhead. Nodes rely
on information reported by a subset of participating nodes
and on latency measurements to this subset to provide low-
error latency estimation at any arbitrary node in the network.
The accuracy of the service and in turn the performance of
any application relying on the virtual coordinate service, can
be severely impacted if nodes do not behave correctly. For
example, malicious nodes can lie in the reports about their own
latencies, or they can inﬂuence the measurements conducted
by honest nodes. As a result, such honest nodes will compute
higher or lower predictions than the actual latencies, or the
entire system will destabilize. Such attacks are referred to as
inﬂation, deﬂation, and oscillation attacks.
Previous work has studied the consequences of attacks
against virtual coordinate systems and proposed several tech-
niques to mitigate their vulnerabilities [1]–[6]. However, these
solutions are validated only through experiments and consider
the effectiveness of the defense strategies under the restric-
tive assumption that an attacker is unaware of or fails to
take into account the associated defense mechanisms. This
assumption is unrealistic as attackers are often aware of the
defense mechanisms employed by the system and good system
design principles state that security should not rely on the
secrecy of the defense algorithm [7]. Given that several attacks
and several defense techniques exist, there is a need for a
systematical evaluation identifying what are the best attack
and defense strategies.
In this paper, we systematically study attack and defense
techniques for virtual coordinate systems. We develop a game
theoretical model that relies on well-known equilibrium con-
cepts in order to assess the strategic interactions between the
attacks and defenses. Game theory provides powerful tools
that allow us to model an advanced adversary who knows
how and what defense strategies are used and can adjust his
attack strategies accordingly. This framework then allows us
to draw out conclusions such as understanding what are the
strengths and weaknesses of both defenses and attacks.
We conduct our work focusing on the representative virtual
coordinate system Vivalidi [8], using two real-life Internet
data sets. We consider a Byzantine adversary that controls
a percentage of the nodes in the system and conducts three
different types of attacks: inﬂation, deﬂation, and oscillation.
These three attacks correspond to when a node reports large
coordinates far away from the origin, small coordinates near
the origin, and randomly chosen coordinates, respectively. We
consider defense strategies based on outlier detection since
they have been shown to provide good results under the
assumption the attacker does not know the defense strategy [6].
Speciﬁcally, we assume the defender attempts to mitigate
the attacks using three defense techniques based on outlier
detection: spatial, temporal, and spatial-temporal. The defense
techniques also use realistic system design assumptions that
make them easily integrated into current virtual coordinate
systems, i.e., they do not rely on the triangle equality [1],
do not require extra node sets and network communication [4,
5], and do not require trusted parties [2, 3].

the threshold that is used to decide if a data point is accepted
by the system or is suspected of coming from a malicious
node. Many outlier detection schemes use a ﬁxed threshold,
usually determined experimentally. Such an approach is inﬂex-
ible, prone to errors, and may be exploited by an adversary
to remain undetected. We leverage control theory to design an
adaptive threshold technique to improve the threshold selection
and include outlier detection mechanisms based on adaptive
thresholds in our study. Our contributions include:
• We model rational attackers in virtual coordinate systems
using the Nash equilibrium and irrational attackers using the
quantal response equilibrium. From the defender side, we use
game theory to tune our defensive mechanisms in order to
mitigate the attacks.
• Using our framework, we determined that for large networks
(i.e., the King topology), the inﬂation attack has the greatest
impact on the system. To defend the system, we ﬁnd that
spatial-temporal outlier detection is the most effective tech-
nique given lower spatial outlier thresholds (e.g., ≤ 1.5) and
both spatial-temporal and spatial outlier detection provide sim-
ilar defense performance for higher thresholds. Furthermore,
our analysis ﬁnds that, independent of the game strategy or
the error metric selected, a spatial outlier threshold of 1.25
results in the best system performance, which is smaller than
the value found in previous work.
• We found that the resulting strategy proﬁles for smaller
networks (i.e., the AMP topology) are not as homogeneous as
those for the larger King topology, with most of the resulting
strategy proﬁles consisting of a mixed strategy. For example,
given the spatial outlier threshold of 1.75, the attacker has
the greatest payoff while applying all three attacks with their
given probabilities using only 10% malicious nodes. The
countermeasure proﬁle looks similar, applying each of the
three defense techniques. Both the percentage of malicious
nodes necessary to efﬁciently create the greatest negative
impact and the attack and defense proﬁles have not previously
been systematically explored.
• We found that when comparing strategies using a ﬁxed
threshold with strategies using an adaptive threshold selection
for the outlier detection, the adaptive threshold is more effec-
tive in defending against attacks than a ﬁxed threshold. Our
analysis shows that when an attacker has as goal disturbing
the network as much as possible, using inﬂation with 30%
attackers is the best attack strategy. If the attacker wants to
remain also undetected then oscillation and deﬂation attacks
with 10% attackers are the best rational choice. We found that
the best parameters for the adaptive threshold is to use the
75th percentile of the prediction error and with a value for the
constant c of 0.08 to update the threshold, where c is a system
parameter that captures the importance given to the prediction
error when updating the threshold.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We pro-
vide background information on virtual coordinate systems
in Section II. We then describe the attacks and defenses we
consider in our theoretical model in Section III and describe
our game theory-based model
in Section V. We describe
our experimental results and our ﬁndings in Section VI. We
overview related work in Section VII and conclude our paper
in Section VIII.
II. SYSTEM MODEL
We consider a decentralized virtual coordinate system.
Decentralized virtual coordinate systems are designed to ef-
ﬁciently create and maintain a stable set of coordinates that
accurately predict the latency between nodes without using
ﬁxed infrastructure nodes. Although each speciﬁc virtual co-
ordinate system differs in some details, they follow a common
design and operation. We selected the representative virtual
coordinate system, Vivaldi, since it is a mature system, con-
ceptually easy to understand and visualize, and has been shown
to produce low error embeddings [8].
Vivaldi is a fully decentralized system which assigns each
host synthetic coordinates in a multi-dimensional Euclidean
coordinate space, offering a good tradeoff between perfor-
mance and overhead [8, 9]. The Vivaldi algorithm is based
on a spring relaxation problem in which each pair of neighbor
nodes is attached by a spring and the current length of the
spring is the estimated round-trip times (RTT) between the
nodes. Tension on the logical springs causes the nodes to
move through the coordinate space as each node attempts
to minimize the difference between current spring lengths
(estimated RTT) and the spring lengths at rest (actual RTT).
By minimizing the tension across all of the springs in the
network, the protocol minimizes the error for the system.
Initially, each node is assigned a random coordinate and
establishes a reference set of peer nodes with which to
exchange periodic updates. As nodes communicate with their
reference set peers, they receive latency information that is
used to update their coordinates. Algorithm 1 shows how a
node i updates its coordinate xi and error ei as a result of
minimizing the tension of the spring with remote node j.
Node i updates its own coordinate and error based on the
tuple consisting of the remote node’s coordinate xj, the remote
node’s relative error with respect to its coordinate, ej (both
directly reported by node j), and the latency from node i
to node j, RT Tij (measured by node i). First, the algorithm
calculates the observation conﬁdence w (line 1) and relative
error es (line 2). The relative error es expresses the accuracy
of the coordinate in comparison to the measured network
latency. Next, node i updates its local error (line 4) using
an exponentially-weighted moving average with the weight α
(line 3). Finally, the node calculates the movement dampening
factor (line 5) and updates its coordinate (line 6). Both ce and
cc are constants acting as system parameters.
As the nodes update their coordinates and the system stabi-
lizes, the average system error is on the order of a few percent.
Once the coordinate system has stabilized, the latency (i.e.,
RTT) between two nodes is trivially estimated by computing
the Euclidean distance between their coordinates. For further
details of the protocol, we refer the reader to the work by
Dabek et al. [8].

The accuracy of the overall virtual coordinate system is
measured by the system prediction error deﬁned as:
Errorpred = |RT TAct − RT TEst|
where RT TAct is the measured RTT between two nodes and
RT TEst is the RTT computed using the coordinates derived by
the virtual coordinate system. Intuitively, the lower the system
prediction error, the more accurate are the predicted RTTs.
III. ATTACK STRATEGIES
In this section, we describe the attacker model and the attack
strategies we consider in this work.
A. Attacker Model
We consider a Byzantine adversary model, where a bounded
percentage of nodes are malicious and lie during the infor-
mation exchange with other honest nodes or inﬂuence the
measurement conducted by honest nodes (i.e., RTT). The set
of malicious nodes may collude.
We assume a malicious adversary has access to all of the
data at a node that any legitimate user would have (insider
access), including the cryptographic keys stored at a node.
This access can be the result of the adversary bypassing the
authentication mechanisms or compromising a node through
other means. As malicious nodes have insider access, nodes
cannot be completely trusted although they are authenticated.
In order to quantitatively compare the effect of the adver-
saries on the accuracy of virtual coordinate systems, we utilize
the relative error deﬁned as:
Errorrel = Errorattack
Errorno attack
where Errorattack is the system prediction error measured
when the system is under attack and Errorno attack is the
system prediction error when all nodes are benign and no
attack takes place. A relative error greater than one indicates
a degradation in accuracy and a value less than one indicates
a better estimation accuracy than the baseline.
We also assume that the adversary knows how and what
defense strategies are used and can adjust his attack strategies
accordingly. In the context of virtual coordinate systems we
assume that a malicious node may lie about its coordinate and
its error in the reports sent to honest nodes, and inﬂuence the
RTT measurements conducted by honest nodes by delaying the
response. Below we show how an attacker can deﬁne speciﬁc
attack strategies based on these malicious actions.
B. Attacks Against Accuracy of Virtual Coordinates
The correct operation of virtual coordinate systems is depen-
dent on the assumption that the peer nodes are altruistic and
respond with correct metrics to queries from any node com-
puting its corresponding coordinates. An attacker controlling
reference set nodes has the ability to inﬂuence the coordinate
maintenance process by manipulating the information, such as
the remote node error and coordinates, returned in response
to a query. By blindly accepting this malicious information, a
correct node computes incorrect coordinates.
In manipulating the information it reports as a peer node, a
malicious node is able to inﬂuence a victim node to move
away from its correct position by either pushing the node
away from or pulling it closer to the malicious node’s reported
coordinates. For example, a malicious node can attract a
victim node towards a random position and away from the
victim’s correct position by reporting a false position and
having a low estimated error. In addition to manipulating
reported information, a malicious node may manipulate the
measurements conducted by delaying its query responses,
causing victim nodes to erroneously update their coordinates
to accommodate for the additional delay. Each of the attacks
can be classiﬁed into one of three categories: coordinate
inﬂation attacks that result in coordinate mappings farther
from the correct location, coordinate deﬂation attacks that
result in victim nodes having incorrect coordinates due to
not performing necessary coordinate updates, and coordinate
oscillation attacks which report varying coordinates and errors
that cause disorder in the system. In the end, each of these
techniques distorts the coordinate space and have a long-
lasting impact on the overall system.
Inﬂation, deﬂation, and oscillation attacks can be caused by
a combination of lying about error and coordinates, and de-
laying messages during the RTT measurement. In our analysis
we consider the following speciﬁc attack strategies:
• Inﬂation: malicious nodes report a large coordinate and
