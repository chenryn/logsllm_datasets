### Problem description
See screenshot http://prnt.sc/cli338  
When I open my dialog the content is unaccessible and unscrollable. Of course
I could add the autoScrollBodyContent property but first I would like that the
dialog uses as much space as possible.
### Steps to reproduce
Create a dialog with lots of content.
