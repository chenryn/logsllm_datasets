User: I realize this is a dated question since appengine now comes in java, but I have a python appengine app that I want to access via GWT.  Python is just better for server-side text processing (using pyparsing of course!).  I have tried to interpret GWT's client-side RPC and that is convoluted since there is no python counterpart (python-gwt-rpc is out of date).  I just tried using JSON and RequestBuilder, but that fails when using SSL.  Does anyone have a good solution for putting a GWT frontend on a python appengine app?
Assistant: I agree with your evaluation of Python's text processing and GWT's quality.  Have you considered using Jython?  Googling "pyparsing jython" gives some mixed reviews, but it seems there has been some success with recent versions of Jython.
