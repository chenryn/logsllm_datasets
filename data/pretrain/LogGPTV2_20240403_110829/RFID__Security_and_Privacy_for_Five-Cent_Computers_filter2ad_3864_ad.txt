tions or pseudorandom ones in order to refresh tag IDs and make responses indis-
tinguishable from random values. Although it is believed that cryptographic compo-
nents are not suitable for low-cost tags, recent work [39,40] has led to more compact
implementations of symmetric key primitives like the Advanced Encryption Stan-
dard (AES). This may lead to implementation of real tags capable of performing
challenge–response protocols using strong cryptographic primitives.
There are, however, some solutions which do not use cryptographic operations
[41, 42]. The authors in [41] proposed a set of challenge–response authentication
protocols built from primitives that can be supported by low-cost RFID tags. The
emphasis was on coming up with lower bounds on the abilities of the attacker and a
trade-off between security and performance. However, these protocols can be easily
broken as demonstrated in [43]. Furthermore, these protocols do not address the
scalability problem and no attempt is being made to prevent tracking of the tags.
In [42], a protocol is proposed which is resistant in a rather weak adversary
model: limited successive tag queries and limited successive eavesdropped inter-
actions between the tag and legitimate readers. The key idea of the protocol is the
use of pseudonyms to help enforce RFID privacy. Each time a tag is queried, it
releases the next pseudonym from its list. In principle, then, only a valid veriﬁer
can tell when two different names belong to the same tag. Of course, an adversary
could query a tag multiple times to harvest all names so as to defeat the scheme. So,
the approach described involves some special enhancements to help prevent this at-
tack. First, tags release their names only at a certain (suitably slow) prescribed rate.
Second, pseudonyms can be refreshed by authorized readers. Although this scheme
does not require the tags to perform any cryptographic operations (it uses only XOR
operations) the protocol involves a large number of message exchanges and requires
updating the keys and pads with new secrets, an operation which may be costly and
difﬁcult to realize.
3.3.6 Proxy Solutions
The protocols presented thus far aim to enhance user privacy against clandestine
reading and scanning that can lead to tracking of users’ activities by the tags they
carry. But tracking by whom? All these solutions protect users against unauthorized
scanning by third parties who want to ﬁnd information about a user’s tags. This pro-
tection is basically achieved by refreshing tag identiﬁers and making tag responses
indistinguishable from random data. But there is still potential for violation of pri-
vacy. Recall, that in all these solutions the back-end database has knowledge of all
the secrets associated with the company’s tagged products. While this company may
not be able to track the tags issued by other companies, it can still track the move-
ments of tags issued by it. Furthermore, a coalition of such companies may create
a federation network (similar to federated identity among enterprises) to exchange
76
T. Dimitriou
information about a user’s movements, habits, and proﬁle. Thus what is needed is
the ability by the users themselves to have complete control of the tags they carry
without losing any of the beneﬁts that RFID technology has to offer [22]. The use
of proxy devices serves exactly this purpose.
A proxy is a personal device such as a mobile phone (or any other similar device)
enabled with reader capabilities [44] that can be used in acquiring and managing a
set of tags on behalf of the user carrying RFID-tagged products. The proxy, being
a more powerful device than an RFID tag, can specify a number of policies that
readers must comply with. This can range from full release of tag data to more
enhanced reader authentication protocols that are beyond the capabilities of to-
day’s simple tags.
So, in addition to the basic security requirements that were mentioned in
Sect. 3.1, the following should also apply in a proxy environment:
• Policy enforcement and access control. We expect the proxy to act as mediator for
tag access in order to minimize the privacy risks inherent in the use of RFID tech-
nology. It makes sense, therefore, to control which readers should have access to
tag information. So, in certain cases it should be possible to release information
about tags while in others to block such requests entirely (not by the use of jam-
ming technology but by the use of proper cryptographic mechanisms). The user
should be able to decide to the extend where access control will be used.
• Transferability and tag release. The main role of the proxy is to handle infor-
mation about the tags a user owns and enhance user privacy. In many situations,
however, it is necessary to bring a tag to its original state (tag release) or transfer
it to a new user. In the ﬁrst case, we require that the current owner should not be
able to lie about the original ID of the tag, while in the second, the privacy of the
new owner must be guaranteed.
• Protection against impersonation and cloning attacks. An adversary should not
be able to impersonate either a tag or the mobile proxy. The ﬁrst attack could lead
to removal of a user’s tagged items since a fake tag could still answer to proxy’s
challenges. The second attack could be useful in tracking a user’s movements. If
the tags the user carries respond to unauthenticated proxy requests, an adversary
may learn valuable information about the user’s habits and location. Additionally,
an adversary should not be able to clone a tag or spoof the proxy by listening to
the messages exchanged between the two.
The concept of having users protecting tags they carry by means of personal de-
vices acting as proxies has been studied in [45–47]. The authors in [45], propose
the use of RFID Guardian, a device that acts as an intermediary between tags and
readers. Being a device with higher computational abilities, the Guardian can en-
force various policies when interacting with readers. One drawback of this approach,
however, is that the Guardian must always be alert in protecting tag responses from
unauthorized read attempts. It has to either allow reader queries, appropriately reis-
suing queries in encrypted form, or actively block tag answers which may not always
be feasible.
An improvement of the above scheme, is the RFID Enhancer Proxy or REP [46],
which assumes the identities of tags and simulates them in the presence of reading
RFID Security and Privacy
77
devices by continuously relabelling the identiﬁers transmitted by tags. While the
REP covers many of the security requirements mentioned here, it suffers from a few
shortcomings that are attributed to the fact that tag identities need to be partially
generated by the tag and match portions of its true ID.
Finally, in [47] a new framework was proposed that uniﬁes the above approaches
and proposes a complete solution for such issues as tag acquisition, proxy authenti-
cation, resistance to privacy attacks, ease of transfer and release, and so on. Once the
proxy performs some initial transformations to the tags under its control, it can either
mediate between tags and readers or let tags directly respond to scan requests. In the
ﬁrst case, the proxy can specify a number of policies that readers must comply with.
This can range from full release of tag data to more enhanced reader authentication
protocols that are beyond the capabilities of today’s simple tags. In the latter case,
it is ensured that tags do not emit any static identiﬁers thus providing ID anonymity
and helping prevent tag tracing. Using the protocols described in the framework it is
guaranteed that only authorized users can acquire and put tags under their control,
user access to tags is authenticated, and when a user no longer needs the tagged
product she can either make it readable to everybody or transfer it to another user in
a way that guarantees the privacy of the new owner.
4 Conclusion
RFID is an important technology that can have remarkable consequences in every
day life activities. In one instance, companies may beneﬁt by improving manufac-
turing logistics and helping prevent product theft. In another, the use of this technol-
ogy may help realize Mark Weiser’s vision of ubiquitous computing in which small
computers embedded in everyday objects could respond to people’s presence and
needs without being actively manipulated [48].
The use of this technology, however, may have important privacy ramiﬁcations.
As highlighted in [25], “if used improperly, RFID has the potential to jeopardize
consumer privacy, reduce or eliminate anonymity, and threaten civil liberties.” We
feel that consumer (as well as corporate) risk must be limited as much as possi-
ble through the use of technical solutions as well as education and policy efforts.
Measures should be taken now, before widespread RFID adoption and deployment
occurs, since it will be very difﬁcult to integrate these measures later on. Thus, se-
curity should ship as “default” to help eliminate any potential threats to the personal
data and privacy of millions of people worldwide.
