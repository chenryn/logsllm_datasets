WE  ARE  CONNECTED…NOW  WHAT?
•
Browse the internet anonymously
•
Tunnel out of restricted networks

Generally just stay anonymous 
•
Tor Hidden Services
TOR HIDDEN SERVICES
•
Services that live only in the Tor Network
•
Turns Tor into a Darknet
•
Services use  .onion as TLD
•
Put a pin in it mother fucker
•
Fairly complex to explain how it still keeps anonymity so just see:

DEMO GRAMS
HOW DO YOU ACTUALLY GET ITEMS
•
Bitcoin (BTC)
•
Transfer BTC to the wallet on your marketplace account 
•
Pay for items with that money
•
Money goes into Escrow 
•
Ship to pickup location
•
See the following OPSEC for further details
BITCOIN
•
You’ve  heard  about  it
•
Online cryptocurrency
•
You set up a digital wallet
•
Either local software or a web based wallet
• I do not recommend a web based wallet. 
•
You can send up to 10 millionth of a bitcoin (8 decimal places or 0.00000001 BTC)
•
Not including fees
•
You send to wallet addresses such as 146uk64ZP2iLsSBBPLzkY3xtCnuJg4yFsE
BUT REALLY
•
BTC (or any cryptocurrency) boils down to a global transaction ledger maintained by the 
computational power of a P2P network. 
•
The more people who participate in BTC the more secure it gets
•
Every transaction is logged by the peers in the P2P network 
•
Relies on PKI for authentication
•
Each wallet has a public and private key
•
When transactions are sent, they are signed with the private key
BITCOIN TUMBLING
•
Tumbling or Mixing is the process of anonymizing bitcoin usage
•
Many parties put coins into communal pool 
•
Pool distributes to different wallets 
• You get back the original amount of coins you put in (minus fee)
SOME CONSIDERATIONS FOR TOR
•
Tor can in some cases reveal your true identity
•
Correlation
• If someone owns both an entry and exit node, they can correlate between the 
two
•
Browser Exploits
• Browser JavaScript engine
• XSS
• Pingbacks over non Tor connections
SOME CONSIDERATIONS FOR BITCOIN
•
BTC is not a fully anonymous currency
•
Blockchain is PUBLIC 
•
Use a tumbling service to further obfuscate the original source of your bitcoins
• Don’t  withdraw  from  a  tumbler  exactly  what  you  put  in
• Spread out withdrawal amounts and send them to new wallet addresses
OPSEC
•
Stay updated on the Tor Blog
•
https://blog.torproject.org
•
Always keep Tor/TorBrowser updated
•
Stay updated on status of current markets. The subreddit is FANTASTIC for that
•
Browser segregation
•
Don’t  be  logging  into  social  media  sites  in  the  same  browser  you  don’t  want  to  be  
tracked on
•
Use a VM specifically for Tor connections (Tails)
•
Even better:
• Specifically boot into a trusted OS instead of VM as host OS has full VM 
visibility
OPSEC CONTINUED
•
Receiving Items
•
Don’t  send  to  your  house
• Send to PO Box or UPS Store. 
• UPS Store will sign for items on your behalf!
• If you have access to an empty house/building, look into sending it there.
•
NEVER open questionable content anywhere you are visible by others
• Wait till you get home
•
Try waiting a week or two to pick up an item
• Foils stakeouts as no one will stakeout a Post Office 24/7 for 2 weeks
• If you want, walk in and confirm item is there and come back later
EVEN MORE OPSEC!
•
Identities
•
Don’t  reuse  identities  
•
Don’t  reuse  passwords
•
Use disposable emails 
• http://www.sharklasers.com/ & https://www.guerrillamail.com/
MAKING MAILBOXES MORE ANONYMOUS
•
Purchase mailbox
•
Buy fake ID using mailbox
•
Burn mailbox
•
Open new mailbox at different location using Fake ID
•
Enjoy more anonymous receiving 
WE BOUGHT SOME STUFF
•
Mini  Discreet…“Baby  Monitor”
•
Runs over the GSM network by inserting a sim card
•
Call the associated number to instantly listen to the room
•
Or  sms  “1111”  to  turn  on  auto  dial  back
•
Sms  “0000”  to  disable  dial  back
Baby Monitor

This is how you use the device:
- Open the back cover. Sim card into the deck will automatically boot.boot light is 3 seconds. after the 
lights go off you can dial the sim card number.
Installation:Please confirm the GSM network signal strength.So as not to affect the results cause can not 
be used
- Number of settings: call the sim card numer with mobilephone or telephone,hang up then setting 
success
- Voice feature:Send â1111â0000â
- The flash of red light indicates the SIM card is correctly inserted. SIM will completed initialization and 
maintain in stand-by status and the light will be off and it is ready to go
PARTING THOUGHTS
•
Clearly a lot of this talk falls into a gray area
•
Darknets,  like  anything,  can  be  use  for  “good”  and  “evil”
•
These networks have legit purposes and not just for shady shit
•
In our view, these networks are the future of how we will communicate online
SHAMELESS SELF PROMOTION
•
Come visit us at 801 Labs and DC801 events

APPENDIX A: BITCOIN MINING
•
To cut down on computation of all the transactions globally, participants (nodes) group 
transactions  unconfirmed  transactions  into  “blocks”  and  suggests  what  the  next  block  
should be
•
To keep too many people from creating blocks is to make them difficult to create. 
•
Node creates block of grouped transactions and adds reference to previous block
• SHA256 of the previous block
•
A  “nonce”  (random  number)  is  appended  to  the  block  and  hashed  twice
• SHA256(SHA254(block+nonce))
•
Each block hash has to be inferior to the current network difficulty 
•
Once the hash of a block + nonce is less than the network difficulty, the block is 
submitted to the BlockChain (ledger of transactions)
•
Mining  is  the  process  of  brute  forcing  nonce’s  in  order  to  submit  a  block  to  the  blockchain
APPENDIX A CONT: BITCOIN MINING REWARD
•
Reward for successfully submitting a block to the blockchain is 25 BTC
APPENDIX A CONT2: BITCOIN MINING IS HARD
•
In  the  very  beginning  people  were  mining  on  their  CPU’s
•
Network difficulty started rising
•
CUDA came around
•
People started mining on their Video Cards (much faster)
• Network difficulty kept rising
•
Mining Pools are created to share the computational load
•
People started building big mining rigs of several Video Cards
•
Network difficulty continued to rise
•
Custom  BTC  mining  FPGA’s  were  created
•
Network difficulty is fairly high at this point
•
Custom  BTC  mining  ASIC’s  are  created
MORE APPENDIX A: CURRENT STATE OF MINING
•
Unless you are running mid to high-end  ASIC’s  you  will  be  spending  more  in  electricity  
than what you will gain back in BTC
•
You will never submit a block to the blockchain on your own
•
