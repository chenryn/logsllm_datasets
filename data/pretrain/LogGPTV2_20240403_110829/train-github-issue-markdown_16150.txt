Currently TS tools can't autocomplete property names that are not identifiers.
e.g.:
    interface Style {
        'font-family'?: string;
    }
There is no autocomplete for the following input:
    var style: Style = { 'fo // no autocomplete
    style[ // no autocomplete
    style. // no autocomplete
I think maybe TS can do better here: show a list of all properties, after user
has selected one, quote it and use brackets if neccesary.
