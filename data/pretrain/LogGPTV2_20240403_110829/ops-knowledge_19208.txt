User:  company's application needs to dynamically generate PDF reports and support a large number of concurrent requests. Please provide a PDF report generation solution, including generation tools, concurrent processing, performance optimization, etc.
Assistant: To address this requirement, the following solutions are recommended: 1. Select iText or PdfBox as the generation tool. Both tools support dynamic generation of PDF reports and have better performance. 2. For concurrent processing, it is recommended to use a thread pool to manage requests, and adjust the size of the thread pool according to the server performance and the expected maximum concurrency to avoid server downtime caused by too many requests. 3. The following aspects are recommended for performance optimization: (1) Cache optimization: store the generated PDF report in the cache, and the request for the same parameters can directly return the report in the cache to avoid generating it every time. (2) File compression: The generated PDF files can be compressed to reduce file size and speed up network transmission. (3) Template optimization: Considering that most of the formal content in the PDF report is fixed, this part of the content can be made into a template separately, and changing data can be dynamically added during generation to avoid repeated generation of fixed content. (4) Resource recycling: After generating PDF reports, resources should be released in time, including memory and file handles, to avoid resource waste and memory leaks. The above is a basic PDF report generation scheme, which can be adjusted and optimized according to the specific situation.
