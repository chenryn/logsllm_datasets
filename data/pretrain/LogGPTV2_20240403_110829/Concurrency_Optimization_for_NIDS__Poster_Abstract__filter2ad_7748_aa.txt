PLENARY SESSION 1
The marriage of technology development and biological discovery
Monday, June 24, 4:00 p.m. – 5:00 p.m.
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Joshua Rabinowitz, Lewis-Sigler Institute, United States
Today, 20 years after sequencing of the first human chromosome, we now have powerful tools for measuring all of the fundamental 
classes of biomolecules, including metabolites While the data gathering capacity of these tools is inspiring, the complexity of biology 
remains humbling The failure of these tools to substantially eliminate major diseases, including metabolic disease, is self-evident In 
this lecture, I will describe our past and ongoing efforts to bridge metabolomic technology development and biological discovery I 
will provide examples of how intensive biological focus improved our metabolomic pipelines, and of how isotope tracing illuminated 
otherwise obscure aspects of metabolism  Examples will be drawn from microbiology, cell biology, and cancer A major focus will 
be on our recent efforts to revisit quantitatively mammalian metabolism, with an  eye towards better understanding of both basic 
metabolic principles and the intersection of diet, metabolism, and disease
PLENARY SESSION 2
Twin and SNP-based studies of metabolomics traits 
Tuesday, June 25, 8:30 a.m. – 9:30 a.m. 
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Dorret I Boomsma, Netherlands Twin Register, Vrije Universiteit, Netherlands
Metabolite profiling allows for an increased understanding of behavioral and psychiatric phenotypes We hypothesized that promising 
metabolites in this respect include those for which a genetic component is present estimated heritability (h2: standardized estimate of 
genetic variance) based on the different genetic relatedness of mono- and dizygotic twin pairs 
Metabolomics data from 4 different platforms for up to 5,117 individuals, including some family members of twins We estimated that 
~50% of variation is due to genetic variation, but heritability estimates differed across metabolite classes and lipid species 
Heritability also can be estimated  from genotype data (SNPs: Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms) by quantifying the genetic similarity
