I have successfully set up PyCharm, created a virtual environment (using either the `virtualenv` command or directly within PyCharm), and activated that environment as my interpreter. Everything is working as expected.

However, when I open a terminal using "Tools > Open Terminal" in PyCharm, the shell prompt does not use the virtual environment. I still need to manually activate it by running `source ~/envs/someenv/bin/activate` in the terminal.

Another approach is to activate the virtual environment in a separate shell and then launch PyCharm from that environment. While this works, it is cumbersome and can lead to issues if I switch between different environments or projects within PyCharm, as I may end up using the wrong environment.

Is there an easier way to have the "Tools > Open Terminal" option automatically activate the virtual environment?

**Solution:**

To resolve this issue, you can configure PyCharm to use a different terminal and ensure the virtual environment is automatically activated. Hereâ€™s how:

1. **Open PyCharm Settings:**
   - Go to `File > Settings` (or `PyCharm > Preferences` on macOS).

2. **Navigate to the Terminal Settings:**
   - In the settings dialog, go to `Tools > Terminal`.

3. **Change the Shell Path:**
   - Set the `Shell path` to `C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe` (for Windows) or the appropriate shell for your operating system.

4. **Enable Virtual Environment Activation:**
   - Check the `Activate virtualenv` checkbox to ensure the virtual environment is activated automatically when opening a new terminal.

5. **Apply and Test:**
   - Click `Apply` and then `OK` to save the changes.
   - Open a new terminal using "Tools > Open Terminal" and verify that the virtual environment is activated automatically.

By following these steps, you should be able to have the terminal in PyCharm automatically activate the virtual environment, making your workflow more efficient and less error-prone.
