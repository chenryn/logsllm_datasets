User: I've set up PyCharm, created my virtualenv (either through the virtual env command, or directly in PyCharm) and activated that environment as my Interpreter. Everything is working just fine.
However, if I open a terminal using "Tools, Open Terminal", the shell prompt supplied is not using the virtual env; I still have to use source ~/envs/someenv/bin/activate within that Terminal to activate it.
Another method is to activate the environment in a shell, and run PyCharm from that environment. This is "workable" but pretty ugly, and means I have major problems if I switch environments or projects from PyCharm: I'm now using the totally-wrong environment.
Is there some other, much-easier way to have "Tools, Open Terminal" automatically activate the virtual environment?
Assistant: Had the same issue, this is how I solved it:
All you gotta do is change the default terminal from Power shell to CMD.
Open pycharm --> Go to Settings --> Tools --> Terminal.
Change the Shell Path to C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe from PS.
Check the Activate virtualenv checkbox.
Hit apply and open new terminal.
