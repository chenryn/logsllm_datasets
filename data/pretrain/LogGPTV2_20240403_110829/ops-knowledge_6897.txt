I am developing a web application using the Tornado framework on a Raspberry Pi. Currently, I connect to my Raspberry Pi via SSH and write my source code using `vi` directly on the device.

However, I would like to write my source code on my development computer and have it automatically synchronized (transferred) to the Raspberry Pi. While I understand that this can be done manually using FTP, I am looking for a more streamlined solution. Ideally, I would like to press F5 in my IDE, and have it automatically transfer any modified source files to the Raspberry Pi. 

Is there a way to achieve this? 

Thank you.

I’ve had a few bad experiences where I lost code that was only stored on my Raspberry Pi's SD card. To avoid this, I now use WinSCP on my laptop to edit files directly from the Raspberry Pi. When I open a file, it automatically opens in Notepad++, and WinSCP saves the changes back to the Raspberry Pi. Additionally, I use WinSCP’s folder synchronization feature to copy the contents of a directory on the SD card to my laptop. This setup isn’t perfect, but it has significantly improved my workflow compared to what I was doing before.
