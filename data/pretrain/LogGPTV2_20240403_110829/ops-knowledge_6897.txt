User: I am writing a web python application with tornado framework on a raspberry pi.
What i actually do is to connect to my raspberry with ssh. I am writing my source code with vi, on the raspberry.
What i want to do is to write source code on my development computer but i do not know how to synchronize (transfer) this source code to raspberry.
It is possible to do that with ftp for example but i will have to do something manual.
I am looking for a system where i can press F5 on my IDE and this IDE will transfer modified source files. Do you know how can i do that ?
Thanks
Assistant: Following a couple of bad experiences where I lost code which was only on my Pi's SD card, I now run WinSCP on my laptop, and edit files from Pi on my laptop, they open in Notepad++ and WinSCP automatically saves edits to Pi. And also I can use WinSCP folder sync feature to copy contents of SD card folder to my latop. Not perfect, but better what I was doing before
