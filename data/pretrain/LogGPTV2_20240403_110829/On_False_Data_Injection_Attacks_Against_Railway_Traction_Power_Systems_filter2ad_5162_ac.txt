an attack vector satisfying the above constraints, he will be
able to achieve the safety breaches.
(cid:10)
We now discuss a heuristic approach that the attacker can
use to aggressively increase the extent of the safety breaches.
Speciﬁcally, the attacker maximizes the total power injected
ViIi,
into the TPS by the regenerating trains, i.e.,
subject to all the constraints of the optimization problem in
Eq. (12). The intuition is that injecting more power into the
TPS will result in higher catenary voltages. This constrained
optimization problem can also be solved by the aforemen-
tioned divide-and-conquer approach. Our numerical results
in Section IV-C show that, under this heuristic approach,
tampering with the sensor measurements of a single train

can already lead to safety breaches.
C. Numerical Examples
We now present numerical examples to illustrate the
efﬁciency and safety attacks. These examples are based
on the TPS shown in Fig. 1,
in which both trains are
decelerating and regenerating. The system model parameters
are given in Table I. We consider a time instant at which the
system state in the absence of attack is given by the ﬁrst part
of Table II, where the total instantaneous power absorbed
by the substations and injected back into the supporting ac
power grid is 3.601 MW. In these examples, we assume that
the attacker can only compromise the voltage and current
measurements of the train at node 2.
1) Efﬁciency Attack: The attacker solves the constrained
optimization problem in Eq. (12) and tampers with V2 and I2
accordingly. We set ΔVi = 50V and ΔIi = 200A, ∀i ∈ Na.
The compromised measurements and the true state of the
system under attack are given in the second part of Table II.
We can see that the compromised voltage measurement at
node 2 is greater than the true value. Consequently, the
train injects less power into the TPS because of the squeeze
control, resulting in less power absorption by the substations.
Speciﬁcally, the total power absorption is 2.888 MW, a 20%
reduction compared with the case of no attack. Thus, the
power efﬁciency of the system is degraded.
2) Safety Attack: The attacker uses the heuristic approach
in Section IV-B2 to compute the safety attack. The com-
promised measurements and the true system state are given
in the third part of Table II. The compromised voltage
measurement at node 2 is lower than its true value. Thus,
the train at node 2 injects more power into the TPS because
of the squeeze control, causing the actual voltage at node
2 to exceed the safety limit. We can see that it is possible
for an attacker to tamper with the measurements of a single
train and already achieve a safety attack. In this example,
since both the trains are regenerating, the catenary voltages
are closer to the safety limit. This makes it easier for the
attacker to achieve the safety attack. Thus, for an attacker
with limited write access to the trains’ measurements (i.e., a
small set Na), he can continuously monitor the system and
wait for feasible moments for launching safety attacks.
V. GLOBAL ATTACK DETECTION
As discussed in Section I, dc TPSes mainly rely on trains’
local controls (i.e., overcurrent and squeeze controls) to
avoid unsafe states. The TPS does not otherwise cross-
check sensor data from different
trains based on an a
priori TPS model to ensure the data’s global consistency.
However, such global monitoring is clearly advantageous,

because anomalies in the data relationships, can help ﬂag
the occurence of an FDI attack.
An attacker that wishes to remain stealthy under global
monitoring thus becomes more constrained, and his actions
may become less effective. In this section, we present the
design of a global monitor for detecting FDI attacks under
the Kerckhoffs’s assumption.
Fig. 3 overviews our global attack detection approach,
in which the trains’ voltage, current, and position mea-
surements are sent to a central TPS monitor periodically.
The TPS monitor applies state estimation (SE), bad data
detection (BDD), position integrity veriﬁcation (PIV), and
secondary attack detection (SAD) in sequence to detect
attacks. In ac utility power grids, similar SE and related BDD
are widely used for detecting faulty data or reducing the
impact of noisy sensor measurements [28]. In Section V-A,
we propose a new BDD design speciﬁc to the application
domain of dc TPS. By checking the consistency among
measurements based on a TPS model, the BDD can detect a
range of FDI attacks. However, the detection is not complete
– an attacker under the Kerckhoffs’s assumption can bypass
it using his knowledge of the system. In Section V-B, we
provide numerical results to illustrate the impacts of these
stealthy attacks. To counter them, in Section V-C, we further
propose a novel SAD algorithm to supplement the BDD,
under an additional assumption that the trains’ position data
is intact, which is ensured by the PIV.
A. TPS Bad Data Detection and Its Vulnerability
Recall that in Section IV-B, the trains apply local controls
based on their own voltage and current measurements only.
Hence, the trains’ position information does not matter. Un-
der global detection, however, compromise of the trains’ po-
sition information becomes relevant, since it may enable the

attacker to mislead the TPS monitor into deriving a wrong
TPS model that is consistent with the compromised voltage
and current measurements. Tampering with the position data
can thus help the attacker evade detection. Although in
practice it is extremely difﬁcult for the attacker to hide the
compromise of train position data because multiple sources
of this data are often available (see Section V-C for the
details), in this section, for generality of analysis, we account
for possible compromise of the position data.
We use ˜x to represent a possibly compromised measure-
ment x, i.e., ˜x = x in the absence of attack and ˜x = x(cid:4) in the
presence of attack. The state of the TPS is a vector of the
nodal voltages, i.e., v. The set of measurements includes
nodal positions ˜s = [˜s1, . . . , ˜sN ]T ∈ R
N×1, and nodal
voltage and current readings ˜z = [˜v,˜i]T ∈ R
2N×1. In the
absence of attack, the measurement vector z is related to the
system state v as z = H(s)v+n, where H(s) = [IN ; Y(s)]
is a measurement matrix depending on the positions s, IN
is an N-dimensional identity matrix, and n ∈ R
2N×1 is
a random measurement noise vector. We assume that n
follows a multivariate Gaussian distribution. The maximum
likelihood (ML) estimate of v, denoted by ˆv, is given by
ˆv = (H(˜s)T Σ−1H(˜s))−1H(˜s)T Σ−1˜z, where Σ is the
covariance matrix of n [28, Chap. 12]. The SE’s BDD
raises an alarm if (˜z − H(˜s)ˆv)T Σ−1(˜z − H(˜s)ˆv) > τ,
where τ is a constant threshold that can be determined to
meet a given false alarm rate under random measurement
noise. The BDD is originally designed to detect faulty sensor
data caused by natural malfunction of sensors. Thus, it is
effective in detecting a range of FDI attacks that are not
speciﬁcally designed to bypass it. However, the attacker
that we consider in this paper, following the Kerckhoffs’s
principle, can design FDI attacks to bypass the BDD. In the
following, we formulate these stealthy attacks.
From an existing result [12], if the compromised measure-
ment vector z(cid:4) is in the column space of the compromised
measurement matrix H(s(cid:4)), z(cid:4) can bypass the BDD. Apply-
ing this result to the TPS, we have the following lemma.
Lemma 1: Any compromised measurements that satisfy
Y(s(cid:4))v(cid:4) = i(cid:4)
(13)
Proof: Lemma 1 holds since any z(cid:4)
can bypass the BDD.
Eq. (13) is in the column space of H(s(cid:4)),
[v(cid:4), i(cid:4)]T = [IN ; Y(s(cid:4))]v(cid:4) = H(s(cid:4))v(cid:4).
that satisﬁes
i.e., z(cid:4) =
In addition to Eq. (13), the TPS monitor may use two
389

other sensor data checks. First, to meet the constraint in
Eq. (13), the attacker may need to compromise the voltage
and current measurements at
the substations. The TPS
monitor may check the substation measurements, i.e., Vi and
Ii, ∀i ∈ Nsub, against the substation model in Eq. (3). To be
stealthy to this check, the attacker can impose an additional
constraint of
i = VNL − RsI(cid:4)
V (cid:4)
i,
∀i ∈ Nsub.
(14)
Second, the TPS monitor can also apply data quality checks
similar to those in Eqs. (10) and (11) to check the trains’
position measurements. Thus, if the attacker can compromise
the position measurements, he needs to satisfy
s − Δs (cid:10) s(cid:4) (cid:10) s + Δs,
(15)
where Δs = [Δs1, . . . , ΔsN ]T are the maximum allowed
errors for position measurements and Δsi = 0 if i /∈ Na.
Therefore, the efﬁciency attacks that are stealthy to the
BDD can be computed by solving the constrained optimiza-
tion problem Eq. (12) with the additional constraints Eq. (13)
to Eq. (15). Similarly, the attack space for BDD-stealthy
safety attacks is characterized by the constraints of the opti-
mization problem Eq. (12), Vi /∈ [Vi,min, Vi,max], i ∈ Nunsafe,
and the additional constraints Eq. (13) to Eq. (15). Naturally,
BDD reduces the attack space since the attacker now needs
to satisfy additional constraints to remain undetected. In the
simulation results presented in Section VI, we show that,
under a realistic TPS setting, the BDD signiﬁcantly reduces
the impact of attacks.
B. Numerical Examples
We now present numerical examples to illustrate the
efﬁciency and safety attacks that can bypass the BDD as
analyzed in Section V-A. The TPS model and parameters
are identical to those in Section IV-C. The true system state
and the compromised measurements are given in Table III.
We set Δsi = 0.6 km, ∀i ∈ Na. To illustrate a powerful
attacker, we assume that the attacker can corrupt the voltage
and current measurements of all the four nodes in Fig. 1, as
well as the positions of both the trains.
1) Efﬁciency Attack: Under the efﬁciency attack,
the
total power injected back to the supporting power grid
by the substations is 3.431 MW, which is a reduction of
about 4.7% compared with no attacks. This reduction is
much less than the 20% caused by the efﬁciency attack
in Section IV-C, which was achieved by compromising the
voltage and current measurements of node 2 only in the
absence of BDD. This result illustrates the ability of the
BDD in limiting the impact of efﬁciency attacks.
2) Safety Attack: We observe that by compromising the
nodal measurements and the trains’ position information, the
attacker can increase the voltage at node 2 to 901.4 V while
bypassing the BDD. Furthermore, if the attacker can gain
write access to any one train (i.e., |Na| = 1), he cannot
