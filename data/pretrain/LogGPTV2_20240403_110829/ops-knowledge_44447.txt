User: I want to program beaglebone black(linux) from PC(linux/windows) using any Python IDE (scientific IDE's like anaconda/python(xy) is preferred). 
How can I do that? How I can configure the systems?
Sincerly.
Assistant: Beaglebone can do whatever we want to do in a a linux PC.
But it is slower than PC so compile in pc and run in beaglebone via SSH is better way.
