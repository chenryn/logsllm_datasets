Figure 8.3: Hourly distributions of ad requests, views and clicks
calculated Privad CTR at 0.05%. While this value may seem discouragingly low,
as we discovered using PDDP analysis (see Section 9.2), in terms of advertising
performance Privad ads are comparable with text ads on Google Display Net-
work.
With slightly more than 400 clicks, we did not observe stark variations
in CTRs corresponding to different conﬁguration parameters (e.g., placement
mode, channel lifetime, channel selection mode, etc.; all produced roughly
equal CTRs). However, we found that the CTR for product-targeted ads is 2.6
times higher than that for search-targeted ads (0.12% versus 0.046%). We also
found that more than 70% of the Privad clicks were registered in single-slot ad-
boxes (with corresponding CTR of 1.1%), with another 14% in the ﬁrst position
in multi-slot adboxes (where we observed an exponential decrease in CTR in
lower positions).
Figure 8.3 shows hourly distributions of ad requests (both search and prod-
uct based), views and clicks. To plot this distribution we used event timestamps
recorded in the local to the client time zone. This information is only available at
the dealer, it is uploaded as the message metadata alongside with the encrypted
request or report and not forwarded to the broker. As expected, there’s a no-

diurnal pattern.
Figure 8.4 plots the distributions of delays between an ad request and the
ﬁrst ad view for the generated channel, and between and ad view and the
corresponding ad click. The former is an inherent attribute of the private-by-
design architecture and depends on the delays between system components.
Additionally, the request-view delay is affected by the channel selection and ad
placement policy at the client and is subject to the availability of the adboxes.
Overall, our prototype was able to generate, deliver and display an ad within
an hour of establishing a new interest for 60% of all channels. With the most
aggressive conﬁguration parameters (channel selection = ’most recent’ and ad
placement = ’everywhere’) the 60th percentile of the delay is below 30 minutes.
We believe this to a large extent comes from the time it takes for an adbox to
show up.
Additionally, using PDDP we measured the delay between sending an ad
request and receiving ads from the generated channel (this information is only

recorded locally at the client). This delay for all responded clients was <10 min-
utes. There are several contributing factors to the request-response delay: length
of the upload cycle at the dealer, polling interval at the client and the ad gener-
ation latency. While the ﬁrst two are conﬁgurable, the latter is implementation-
speciﬁc. In our experiments, the observed average ad generation latency was
below 2 seconds (with 99th percentile of 7 second).
While, as Figure 8.4 shows, the majority of the clicks happen within min-
utes after an ad view (the 90th percentile is less than 10 minutes), we do not
have enough data points to establish the relationship between CTR and time
elapsed since identifying a new user interest. Nonetheless, we found that CTR
is affected by the number of times an ad was shown (so-called, ‘opportunities to
see’ or ots), with the ﬁrst, the second and the third ots accounting for 70%, 14%
and 10% of all clicks respectively.
To evaluate the relevance of Privad ads to user interests, we compute the
cosine similarity using terms from the generated ad content and from the cor-
91
responding ad request for all clicked and viewed ads. With even such a sim-
ple metric, which does not take into account semantic relevance, it is clear that
clicked ads tend to better match the original request than non-clicked ads. As
Figure 8.5 shows, almost 40% of the clicked ads have 0.4 similarity coefﬁcient
with ad requests, whereas for viewed ads this number is slightly more than 20%.
We manually inspected clicked ads with similarity lower than 0.1 and found
that the majority of corresponding requests contain terms from non-English lan-
guages and do not appear in the actual ad content.
Overall, we ﬁnd the achieved CTR to be encouraging given the fact that
we fully relied on shopping engines to match ad requests to relevant products
and that our ad content was produced automatically from resulting products
(which, despite our best effort, sometimes did not look as intelligible and ap-
pealing as handcrafted ads). Naturally, we could have seen higher CTR by ren-
dering our ads only in top positions. Apart from this, we believe that Privad
CTR can be increased by improving targeting heuristics (e.g., reducing noise
in search-based targeting), investing in better request matching algorithms and
serving advertising content designed by hand, not auto-generated.

CHAPTER 9
COLLECTING DATA WITH PDDP
As opposed to the aggregate performance stats maintained by Privad using
view and click reports, PDDP provides a privacy preserving mechanism to col-
lect per-user stats and perform user-centric analysis. In this chapter, we describe
our experience exploring the extent to which a differentially private data collec-
tion system can be used to understand what is going on behind the scenes in
the private-by-design ad deployment.
Towards this end, we start out by building conﬁdence in the differentially
private results by collecting attributes that characterize the Privad’s user popu-
lation and comparing them with the data available at the server-side. We then
exercise PDDP functionality to get better visibility into the client-side and un-
derstand the reasons for the observed view and click rates. We also analyze
advertising performance for Google ads and compare it with Privad’s. We ex-
amine the difference between search and display ads in terms of the before-
and after-click user behavior. Additionally, we attempt to discover the behav-
ioral differences between clicking and non-clicking users. Finally, we look at the
privacy deﬁcits accumulated as a result of our analysis and study the privacy
implications for the end users.
93
In general, our primary goal in evaluating PDDP was not to arrive at any
deﬁnite conclusion per se (our user population is not sufﬁciently large for this
purpose), but to demonstrate the types of analysis made possible with PDDP.
9.1 Aggregate User Characteristics
We start our PDDP data collection with two simple queries, one retrieving the
user timezone, the other the user geographical region. Timezone information is
available to addons as a part of the Firefox API. To obtain the geographical data
the clients call the Maxmind GeoIP API. Both values are updated whenever the
browser restarts and are stored in the client’s SQLite database. The respective
queries are simple one-line select statements with buckets enumerating all pos-
sible timezones in one case, and the top 20 most represented countries (in terms
of the volume of IPs that appear in the dealer’s logs) in the other. Both queries
were active throughout a 24-hour time interval (which means that their result
sets contain answers from all clients who remained online long enough to re-
ceive and execute the query, and encrypt and submit the answer). In total, we
collected 4852 answers for the timezone query with 588 random coins added
to each bucket,1 which corresponds to a standard deviation of 12.12. For the
geographical region we obtained 4604 answers with 585 per-bucket coins (with
stdev = 12.09).
Figure 9.1 shows the distribution of users over timezones collected using
PDDP, together with the distribution of messages received by the dealer dur-
ing the same 24-hour time span constructed using the local timestamp from
the message meta-info ﬁeld. The two clusters in the histograms center around

the EDT (UTC-04:00) and CEST (UTC+02:00) timezones, which correspond to
American and European user populations. While both distributions generally
have the same form, a few individual histogram bars diverge by up to 4%. One
possible explanation is the fact that the volume of generated messages varies
from user to user, with an adblocked user generating only a fraction of mes-
sages generated by a non-adblocked user (no view and click messages). Also,
the number of messages depends on the browsing behavior (e.g., performing
searches vs. following links) and on the duration of online activities.
Figure 9.2 plots two distributions of Privad users over a list of countries. One
is based on the noisy answers from the second PDDP query, the other is com-
puted using 4607 IPs extracted from the dealer’s logs from the same 24-hour
period. The tallest bar on the ﬁgure corresponds to the US users, and the more
sizable European population is spread over a number of countries including
Germany, Russia, Great Britain, France and others. Almost all values computed
from back-end data lie within the 95% conﬁdence interval of respective PDDP
values, with the exception of the Spain and NA ratios. The reason for this mi-

nor mismatch is likely to be that local GeoIP info is captured as soon as the
browser starts and is not updated until the next browser restart, therefore it can
be somewhat stale by the time a client received the PDDP query. For example,
if a user enabled a proxy or joined a different network, the IP address recorded
in the dealer’s log can be different from the one used to retrieve local GeoIP
info. Overall, we ﬁnd that the back-end data conﬁrms trends discovered using
the differentially private mechanism, which serves as a practical validation of
PDDP results.
We use the rest of this section to describe our experience in exercising the
PDDP functionality to the widest extent possible in order to learn everything
we could about our deployment.
To build a better picture of Privad users, we used PDDP to query the operat-
ing system installed on the user machine (also available as a part of Firefox API).
We found that among the 4428 clients who responded to the query, 64.2% run
Windows, 21.6% use OSX and 14.4% have a Linux installed. Clearly, with the

according to [59]), this sample is representative of a set of technically savvy
power users.
Finally, we executed a query to ﬁnd the percentages of adblocked users as
well as users with views and clicks for all types of ads (both Google and Pri-
vad). The query was active for 96 hours and accumulated a total of 5909 an-
swers. Among the users who submitted their answers ca. 709 spent less than
