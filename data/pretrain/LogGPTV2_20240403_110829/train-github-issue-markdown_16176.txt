Using the Redis backend, If you make modifications to your
queues/exchanges/routing keys, you can end up with strange behaviour where
queues get duplicated, and you end up with tasks being executed multiple
times;
    Queue                        Exchange                     Routing Key
    ----------------             ----------------             ----------------
    worker                       tasks                        worker.#
    sender                       tasks                        sender.#
    notification_send            tasks                        dynamic.notification_send.#
    notification_build           tasks                        dynamic.notification_build.#
    notification_send            tasks                        notification_send
    default                      tasks                        task.default.#
    notification_build           tasks                        notification_build
    notification_build           tasks                        task.notification_build.#
    default                      tasks                        default.#
    notification_send            tasks                        notification_send.#
    builder                      tasks                        builder.#
    notification_build           tasks                        task.notification_build
    default                      tasks                        task.#
    notification_build           tasks                        notification_build.#
To clear this out, I have to manually delete the Redis DB or find the keys via
CLI and delete them - at which point things turn back to normal
    Queue                        Exchange                     Routing Key
    ----------------             ----------------             ----------------
    notification_build           notification_build           notification_build.#
    default                      tasks                        task.#
    worker                       worker                       worker.#
There should be the ability to not only purge tasks, but also purge out
bindings / routing entries - because queue changes are going to happen and
this is very unexpected behaviour.
