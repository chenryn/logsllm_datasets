Question: "A cybersecurity analyst is evaluating the effectiveness of implementing network intrusion prevention systems to mitigate the risk of adversaries using data encoding for command and control activities. Which of the following statements accurately reflects the potential impact of this mitigation technique?"
 "A": "Network intrusion prevention systems may utilize signatures to identify traffic for specific malware, but adversaries can change C2 signatures over time to avoid detection."
 "B": "The implementation of network intrusion prevention systems will completely eliminate the risk posed by data encoding in command and control activities."
 "C": "Using network intrusion prevention systems is unnecessary if the organization employs application whitelisting as it will block any encoded traffic by default."
 "D": "Network intrusion prevention systems will increase the risk of false positives, making it more difficult to detect legitimate traffic than encoded C2 traffic."
Answer: A
