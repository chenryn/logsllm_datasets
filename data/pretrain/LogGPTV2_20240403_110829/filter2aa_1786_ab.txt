### Behavioral and Property Variables
- **Entry Behaviors**: Methods of entry, tools used, time of day, etc.
- **Property Behaviors**: Items taken, property damaged, etc.
- These variables are considered independent.

### Dichotomous Conversion
- Convert these behaviors into yes/no questions:
  - Entry Behaviors: "Was a screwdriver used? Was a crowbar used? Was a window open? Were the occupants home?"

### Similarity Coefficient
- Apply a similarity coefficient, such as Jaccard’s Index, which is a coarse but commonly used measure (Tonkin et al., 2008).
- **Jaccard’s Index**:
  - \( x \): Count of behaviors present in both offenses.
  - \( y \): Count of behaviors present in offense A but not in B.
  - \( z \): Inverse of \( y \).

### Interpretation
- **1.0**: Perfect similarity.
- **0.0**: Perfect dissimilarity.
- One coefficient per domain, ignoring joint non-occurrences, which can be a concern with police data due to potential unrecorded behaviors.

### Logistic Regression
- Use each coefficient in a direct logistic regression model for predictive analysis.
- Example: "To what extent does being a smoker contribute to the risk of having a heart attack?" or "Does similarity in the entry behaviors domain predict whether two burglaries are linked?"

### Logistic Regression Outputs
- Determine if a variable is positively or negatively correlated with the outcome.
- Assess how well a given variable fits the data.
- Calculate the amount of variance explained by a given variable.
- Provide a p-value (probability of seeing this result if the null hypothesis is true).

### Forward Stepwise Logistic Regression
- Start with one domain and add another at each step.
- Retain domains that improve the model's predictive power; discard those that do not.
- This process determines the optimal combination of domains.

### ROC Curves
- Graphically represent the probability of false positives (x-axis) against the probability of true positives (y-axis).
- More reliable measure of predictive accuracy based on the area under the curve (AUC).
- **Interpretation**:
  - Diagonal line: No better than chance.
  - Higher AUC values indicate greater predictive accuracy.
  - AUC values:
    - 0.5 – 0.7: Low
    - 0.7 – 0.9: Good
    - 0.9 – 1.0: High

### Exceptions
- Some offenses, like homicide, may be less suitable for this method (Bateman & Salfati, 2007; Harbort & Mokros, 2001; Sorochinski & Salfati, 2010).
- Offenders may show varying levels of distinctiveness (Bouhana et al., 2016).
- Certain behaviors, such as property stolen in burglaries, may be less consistent (Bennell & Canter, 2002; Bennell & Jones, 2005).
- Modus operandi (MO) is a learned behavior, and offenders may change their MO in response to events (Pervin, 2002; Douglas & Munn, 1992; Donald & Canter, 2002).
- Behaviors under the offender's control are more likely to be stable (Furr & Funder, 2004; Hettema & Hol, 1998).
- Offenses involving victim interaction may differ based on the victim's actions (e.g., fighting back, running, shouting for help).

### Research Limitations
- Most research has been applied to solved crimes (Woodhams & Labuschagne, 2012).
- Studies often use small samples and focus on serial offenses (Slater et al., 2015).

### Experimentation
- **Concept**: Applying Criminal Linkage Analysis (CLA) to network intrusions, specifically where an attacker has code execution.
- **Research Design**:
  - Historically, police reports have been used, but they can be inaccurate and incomplete (Alison et al., 2001; Canter & Alison, 2003).
  - Traumatic experiences can distort memories (Freyd, 1996; Halligan et al., 2003).
  - Crime reports may lack granularity, and previous studies have used simulations (honeypots).
  - Modified open-source Python SSH keylogger (strace) to record keystrokes on exposed VMs.
  - Participants (pentesters, students, amateur enthusiasts) were asked to perform specific tasks (get root, steal data, cover tracks, explore).

### Hypothesis
- Cyber attackers will exhibit consistent and distinctive behaviors while executing commands on compromised hosts, providing a statistically significant basis for distinguishing between linked and unlinked attack pairs.

### Analysis
- Split into behavioral domains (navigation, enumeration, exploitation) and coded for metadata variables (keystroke intervals, command intervals, backspaces).

### Metadata Variables
- Non-dichotomous variables used in addition to behavioral domains (Bennell & Canter, 2002; Tonkin et al., 2008; Filippoupolitis et al., 2014).

### Results
- Average attack time per host: 133.34 minutes.
- Average commands per host: 243.
- Two participants got root on Host A, and one on Host B.
- Calculated similarity coefficients for 100 crime pairs (10 linked, 90 unlinked).
- Used SPSS for logistic regression analysis.
- **Key Findings**:
  - Three behavioral domains (navigation, exploitation, enumeration) can classify linked/unlinked offenses with high accuracy.
  - Navigation was the most effective predictor, followed by exploitation and enumeration.
  - Keystroke and command interval variables were not reliable predictors.
  - Backspace showed a weak negative correlation to linkage.
  - Results were statistically significant for behavioral domains but not for metadata variables.
  - ROC curves: Navigation = 0.992 AUC.

### Conclusion
- The study demonstrates the potential of CLA in cyber forensics, particularly in identifying linked attacks through consistent and distinctive behaviors.
