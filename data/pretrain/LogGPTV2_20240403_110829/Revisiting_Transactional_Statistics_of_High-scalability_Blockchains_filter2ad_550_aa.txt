ABSTRACT
Scalability has been a bottleneck for major blockchains such
as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Despite the significantly improved
scalability claimed by several high-profile blockchain projects,
there has been little effort to understand how their trans-
actional throughput is being used. In this paper, we ex-
amine recent network traffic of three major high-scalability
blockchains—EOSIO, Tezos and XRP Ledger (XRPL)—over
a period of seven months. Our analysis reveals that only a
small fraction of the transactions are used for value transfer
purposes. In particular, 96% of the transactions on EOSIO
were triggered by the airdrop of a currently valueless to-
ken; on Tezos, 76% of throughput was used for maintaining
consensus; and over 94% of transactions on XRPL carried
no economic value. We also identify a persisting airdrop on
EOSIO as a DoS attack and detect a two-month-long spam
attack on XRPL. The paper explores the different designs
of the three blockchains and sheds light on how they could
shape user behavior.

INTRODUCTION
1
As the most widely-used cryptocurrency and the first applica-
tion of a blockchain system, Bitcoin has been frequently crit-
icized for its slow transactional throughput, making it hard
to adopt as a payment method. Indeed, Bitcoin is only able
to process around 10 transactions per second, significantly
slower than the throughput offered by centralized payment
providers such as Visa, which can process over 65,000 trans-
actions per second [55]. Many blockchains have since been
designed and developed in order to improve scalability, the
most valued of these in terms of market capitalization [12]
being EOSIO [8], Tezos [24], and XRP Ledger (XRPL) [62].
Although many of these systems have existed for several
years already, to the best of our knowledge, no in-depth eval-
uation of the actual usage of their transactional throughput
has yet been performed, and it is unclear up to what point
these blockchains have managed to generate economic ac-
tivity. The knowledge of both the quantity and the quality
of the realized throughput is crucial for the improvement
of blockchain design, and ultimately a better utilization of
blockchains. In this paper, we analyze transactions of the
three blockchains listed above and seek to find out:
RQ1 To what extent has the alleged throughput capacity
been achieved in those three blockchains?
RQ2 Can we classify transactions by analyzing their meta-
data and patterns?
RQ3 Who are the most active transaction initiators and
what is the nature of the transaction they conducted?
RQ4 Can we reliably identify DoS and transactional spam
attacks by analyzing transaction patterns?
Contributions. We contribute to the body of literature on
blockchain in the following ways:
(1) We perform the first large-scale detailed analysis of
transaction histories of three of the most widely-
used high-throughput blockchains: EOSIO, Tezos, and
XRPL.
(2) We classify on-chain transactions and measure each
category’s respective share of the total throughput, in
terms of the number of transactions and their economic
volume.
(3) We establish a measurement framework for assessing
the quality of transactional throughput in blockchain
systems.
(4) We expose spamming behaviors that have inflated
throughput statistics and caused network congestion.
(5) We highlight the large gap between the alleged through-
put capacity and the well-intended transactions being
performed on those three blockchains.
Our analysis serves as the first step towards a better under-
standing in the nature of user activities on high-scalability
blockchains. On-chain monitoring tools can be built based on
our framework to detect undesired or even malicious behavior.
Summary of our findings. Despite the advertised high through-
put and the seemingly commensurate transaction volume, a
large portion of on-chain traffic, including payment-related
transactions, does not result in actual value transfer. The
nature and purpose of non-payment-related activities varies
significantly across blockchains.

Specifically, we observe that the current throughput is
only 34 TPS (transactions per second) for EOSIO, 0.43 TPS
for Tezos and 15 TPS for XRPL. We show that 96% of the
throughput on EOSIO was used for the airdrop of a valueless
token, 76% of transactions on the Tezos blockchain were used
to maintain consensus, and that over 94% of transactions on
XRPL carried zero monetary value.
2 BACKGROUND
In this section, we briefly explain the fundamentals of per-
missionless blockchains and describe the structure of the
three blockchain systems that we evaluate, highlighting their
various design aspects.
2.1 Blockchain Basics
In its essence, a blockchain is an append-only, decentralized
database that is replicated across a number of computer nodes.
Most blockchain systems record activities in the form of
“transactions”. A transaction typically contains information
about its sender, its receiver, as well as the action taken, such
as the transfer of an asset. Newly created transactions are
broadcast across the network where they get validated by
the participants. Valid transactions are grouped into data
structures called blocks, which are appended to the blockchain
by referencing the most recent block. Blocks are immutable,
and state changes in the blockchain require new blocks to be
produced.
Network latency and asynchrony inherent in the distributed
nature of blockchains lead to a number of challenges. In
particular, a blockchain must be able to reach consensus
about the current state when the majority of participating
nodes behave honestly. In order to resolve disagreement, a
consensus protocol prescribing a set of rules is applied as
part of the validation process.
The Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus, introduced by Bit-
coin and currently also implemented by Ethereum, requires
the participant to solve a computationally expensive puzzle
to create a new block. Although PoW can maintain consis-
tency well, it is by nature very time- and energy-consuming,
which limits its throughput. To preserve security while main-
taining a sufficient degree of decentralization, scalability is
often sacrificed [60]. Indeed, the rate of block creation for
both Bitcoin and Ethereum is relatively slow—on average
10 minutes and 14 seconds per block, respectively—and the
only way to increase the throughput is to increase the size of
a single block, allowing for more transactions per block.
Another issue related to blockchain systems is the need for
all participants to replicate the data. Since blockchains are
append-only, participants need to ensure that their storage
capacity keeps pace with the ever-increasing size of blockchain
data. It is therefore crucial for blockchains to be designed in
such a way that the storage used increases only moderately
with time.
2.2 Consensus Mechanisms
In response to the scalability issues related to PoW, many
blockchains have developed other mechanisms to ensure con-
sensus, which allow higher rates of block creation.
Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) in EOSIO. EOSIO uses the
Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) protocol which was first
introduced in Bitshares [7].
Users of EOSIO, stake EOS tokens to their favored block
producers (BPs) and can choose to remove their stake at
any time. The 21 BPs with the highest stake are allowed to
produce blocks whereas the rest are put on standby. Blocks
are produced in rounds of 126 (6 × 21). The order of block
production is scheduled prior to each round and must be
agreed upon by at least 15 block producers [8].
Liquid Proof-of-Stake (LPoS) in Tezos. For its consensus mech-
anism, Tezos employs another variant of Delegated Proof-of-
Stake: the Liquid Proof-of-Stake (LPoS) [49]. Tezos’ LPoS
differs from EOSIO’s DPoS in that with the former, the
number of consensus participants—or “delegates”—changes
dynamically [24, 49]. This is because any node with a mini-
mum amount of staked assets, arbitrarily defined to be 8,000
XTZ (about 16,000 USD at the time of writing [12]), is al-
lowed to become a delegate, who then has the chance to be
selected as either a “baker” or an “endorser”. Each block is
produced (“baked”) by one randomly selected baker, and
verified (“endorsed”) by 32 randomly selected endorsers [49].
The endorsements are included in the following block.
XRP Ledger Consensus Protocol (XRP LCP) in XRPL.
XRPL is a distributed payment network created by Rip-
ple Labs Inc. in 2012 that uses the XRP ledger consensus
protocol [11]. Each user sets up its own unique node list of
validators (UNL) that it will listen to during the consensus
process. The validators determine which transactions are to
be added to the ledger. Consensus is reached if at least 90%
of the validators in each ones’ UNL overlap. If this condition
is not met, the consensus is not assured to converge and forks
can arise [11].
2.3 Account and Transaction Types
In this section we describe the types of transactions that
exist on the three blockchains.
2.3.1 EOSIO. EOSIO differentiates between system and reg-
ular accounts. The former are built-in accounts created when
the blockchain was first instantiated, and are managed by
currently active BPs, while the latter can be created by
anyone. System accounts are further divided into privileged
and unprivileged accounts. Privileged accounts, including
eosio, eosio.msig, and eosio.wrap, can bypass authoriza-
tion checks when executing a transaction [19, 28] (see Sec-
tion 2.2).
EOSIO system contracts, defined in eosio.contracts [21],
are held by system accounts. One of the most commonly
used system contracts is eosio.token, which is designed for
creating and transferring user-defined tokens [19]. Regular
accounts can freely design and deploy smart contracts.
