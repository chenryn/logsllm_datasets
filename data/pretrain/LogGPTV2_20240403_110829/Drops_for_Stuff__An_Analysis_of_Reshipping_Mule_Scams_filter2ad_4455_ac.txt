ping company when the post ofﬁce clerks asked where they received
the label from. In response, reshipping scams prohibited the use of
stolen credit cards to purchase labels and are actively imposing ﬁnes of
up to 1,000 US dollars on the stuffer that violate this rule. Furthermore,
such violators are threatened with public exposure if a post ofﬁce
declines a package because of a defective label (e.g., if the drop reports
the incident to the operator). As a result, criminals moved toward
“white label” shipping services [10], where the payment is made via
a legitimate account (e.g., a bank account that was opened in the name
of a drop with his personally identiﬁable information, see Section 3)
or through companies. These labels are often considerably cheaper
than those one would buy directly from a shipping company (due to
large volume discounts). For example, criminals pay only 51.74 US
dollars for a USPS Priority Mail Express label for a ﬁve-pound package
to Russia, while the regular label costs 72.55 US dollars. Figure 3
provides more detail on the distribution of the costs of the prepaid
shipping labels that the scammers use. In all cases, the majority of the
labels costs less than 100 US dollars. Furthermore, the distribution of
the label cost appears to be correlated with the value of items the scam
operation targets: SHIPPING-A targets luxury goods and increases the
slowest, with about 67% of all package labels costing 100 US dollars
or less; SHIPPING-E focuses on Apple products, generally high-value,
with nearly 90% of all prepaid labels costing 100 US dollars or less;
on the other hand, SHIPPING-D specializes on lower-price items, and
almost all of its labels (99%) cost 100 US dollars or less (all labels cost
less than 125 US dollars). Note that the stuffers of SHIPPING-A reship
to other reshipping services within the US (in Claymont, Delaware
and Dover, Delaware; see Table 6), possibly to obscure their traces
further. These domestic labels account for almost all labels costing
less than 45 US dollars.2
Upon arrival of the packages at their destinations, criminals sell the
goods on the black market, sometimes directly to wholesale retailers,
who introduce the items into the regular and seemingly-legitimate deliv-
ery chain. Generally, in those foreign countries, the products can be sold
for a 30-50% markup on top of the original purchase price, which allows
scammers to increase their illicit income further. For instance, an Apple
MacBook selling for 1,000 US dollars in the US, sells for 1,400 US dol-
lars in Russia because the goods are often priced higher (custom duty,
taxes, and other fees), or are difﬁcult to acquire (sanctions, embargoes).
2Removing domestic labels from the cumulative percentage shifts
SHIPPING-A’s line to right, below SHIPPING-E.
Figure 3: Distribution of prepaid label cost. The different reship-
ping scam sites specialize on different goods: SHIPPING-A focuses
on luxury goods, SHIPPING-D targets reshipping of lower-priced
items, and SHIPPING-E specializes on Apple Products. Note that
SHIPPING-A includes prepaid labels to domestic addresses (within
the US) to other reshipping services to further obscure the stuffers’
ﬁnal destination address. For SHIPPING-A, labels costing less than
about 45 US dollars are almost exclusively domestic labels.
from reshipping sites expose two different business models: taking
a percentage cut of the item’s value, or charging a ﬂat rate fee.
For instance, SHIPPING-A takes a percentage cut. Here, stuffers
must pay a portion of the product’s value to the site operator as the
reshipping fee. Note that SHIPPING-A specializes on premium and
high-value products, and requires a minimum value of any item shipped
through it of 300 US dollars. Speciﬁcally, the operator charges up to
50% of the items’ values and he maintains a detailed list of products
that are eligible for reshipment. This list speciﬁes the exact percentage
cuts that the operator takes: e.g., 40–50% cut for Apple MacBooks,
35% for digital cameras and lenses, or 25% for baby strollers.
On the other hand, SHIPPING-B targets lower-priced products (e.g.,
clothing) and simply charges a ﬂat-rate fee of 50 to 70 US dollars per
package.
In both cases, reshipping scam site operators take a considerable
portion of the proﬁt. Stuffers are willing to pay the signiﬁcant over-
head because the operators play a key role in the scam: without the
reshipping support, the stolen credit cards or accounts are worth little
because they cannot be efﬁciently monetized.
In addition, reshipping sites provide a certain level of customer
service for successful package delivery. If a drop who is not marked
as problematic embezzles the package, reshipping sites offer free
shipping for the next package or pay up to 15% of the item’s value
as compensation to stuffers (e.g., as compensation for “burning” the
credit card or the already-paid reshipping label). Note that, in case the
authorities identify the drop and intercept the package, the reshipping
sites provide no compensation (“acts of God”). For a premium, stuffers
can rent private drops that no other stuffers will have access to. Such
private drops are presumably more reliable and are shielded from
interference by other stuffers and, in turn, have a reduced risk to be
discovered (hence, lower risk of losing packages).
Besides the actual drops, prepaid shipping labels are another critical
resource. Historically, criminals simply created and used fake labels by
modifying information and barcodes of existing labels. Once shipping
companies started identifying such fraudulent labels, the miscreants
started purchasing real labels but payed for them with stolen credit
cards. Recently, shipping companies have become even more vigilant
and started performing thorough checks on the validity of the credit
cards that are used to purchase labels. This lead to successfully stopped
shipments and discovered drops. Besides the shipping companies,
drops became increasingly suspicious of the legitimacy of the reship-

Table 4: Online stores targeted by stuffers who use SHIPPING-C.
Top 20 of the online stores targeted by stuffers who use SHIPPING-C
for reshipping, accounting for 89.63% of all packages. Note that

merchants (e.g., Best Buy), who ship the item once the order was
processed by shop.com.
ucts that are worth hundreds or even thousands of dollars. Based on
the recorded unit prices, we later investigate the ﬁnancial loss caused
by reshipping scams in Section 5.2.2.
Interestingly, the log data from SHIPPING-C also speciﬁes from
which online store the items were purchased. Cybercriminals target a
variety of online stores, and the stuffers using SHIPPING-C for reship-
ping defrauded 233 unique online stores alone. Table 4 lists the top
20 websites with the most purchases, which account for 89.63% of the
packages. The store site with most illicit purchases, shop.com, is a
large shopping comparison and marketing company, where customers
can shop from many retailers and manufactures. shop.com, however,
only sells products through their OneCart program, which works sim-
ilar to Amazon Marketplace. That is, shop.com handles payment
processing and informs the merchant to ship the product, who, in turn,
ships the goods. Multiple reasons might exist why criminals prefer
to use shop.com by such a large margin: i) fraudulent use of credit
cards might not be detected as quickly as by the merchants themselves,
or ii) the delay to notify the merchant when shop.com receives a
chargeback or is alerted about a fraudulent credit card might be long
enough for the items to have arrived at the drop and might have been
already reshipped. This increases the response time of the merchants
and payment processor which is advantageous for the cybercriminals.
5.1.3 Allocation of Drops to Stuffers
Reshipping scam operators act as service providers, renting their
drops out to stuffers. As such, they have control of how many drops the
stuffers can use at the same time. Subsequently, stuffers choose their
drops from the candidate pool and assign reshipping tasks to them.
Our data contains a snapshot of an assignment between 47 drops and
38 stuffers from SHIPPING-A. In Figure 6, the white circles on the
bottom are drops, and the black circles are stuffers. A black dot on
the grids means that the corresponding drop reships packages for the
corresponding stuffer. Drops are ordered from left to right in the number
of the associated stuffers. Stuffers are ordered from bottom to top in
the number of the allocated drops. The red cross indicates the average
number of drops and stuffers respectively. For instance, drops on the
right side of the vertical red line have more stuffer assignments than
the average drop. Note that the assignment is not exclusive, a drop can
forward packages for multiple stuffers, and a stuffer can have multiple
drops to distribute the reshipping tasks to. The eight left most drops
(gray shade), however, are exclusive drops and serve only one stuffer.
5.2 Negative Impact and Financial Loss
Although it might appear that the prey of reshipping scams are
fundamentally the users whose ﬁnancial and personally-identiﬁable
information is stolen (like credit cards and store accounts), there are
several other actors who are negatively affected by the scam. Here-
(a) SHIPPING-A
(b) SHIPPING-B
(c) SHIPPING-C
(d) SHIPPING-F
Figure 4: Proportion statistics of package content categories
per reshipping scam. SHIPPING-A specializes on luxury-goods and
charges a percentage cut per shipment, SHIPPING-B explicitly targets
low-priced items and charges a ﬂat fee per package, SHIPPING-C
focuses on high-value electronics and charges a percentage cut,
SHIPPING-F targets low to medium priced items.
5.1.2 Product Categories and Targeted Merchants
Reshipping scams tend to ship high-value and highly-demanded
products to foreign countries, which can, in turn, yield a higher proﬁt
than lower-priced items. In the following, we examine the core prod-
ucts that cybercriminals purchase for these reshipping scams. Our
ﬁndings can help retailers to avoid fraud and assist postal services to
identify suspicious packages because they allow to focus attention on
the products that the criminals desire. We group the products into seven
categories (see Table 3): Apple Products (iPhones, iPads, and Mac-
Books), Camera Related (action camcorders, digital SLRs, and lenses),
Computer Related (desktops, laptops, and parts like processors and
disks), Other Electronics (referring to other electronic items besides the
ones listed in the previous three categories, like GPS, or TVs), Fashion
and Apparel (e.g., clothes, watches, and handbags), Nutrition (e.g.,
vitamins and sport supplements), and Miscellaneous (products not
included in the other categories, such as power tools and baby strollers).
Figure 4 illustrates the proportions of the product categories ob-
served for four reshipping scam operations (compare Table 2), whose
logs contain detailed descriptions of the products that the stuffers
purchased. For SHIPPING-C, cybercriminals heavily targeted the
Apple Products and Camera Related categories (see Figure 4(c)) and,
for SHIPPING-B, Fashion and Apparel (see Figure 4(b)). Generally,
electronic products, such as iPhones and cameras, have high unit prices
but are inexpensive to ship because of their limited weight and small
size. Luxury and brand-name fashion and accessories are often in
high-demand in foreign markets and are also less likely to be damaged
in transit.
In the case of SHIPPING-C, our data also includes the purchase
prices of the products that the stuffers shipped. Table 3 shows the
product categories, the average prices, and the median prices of the
products for each category. Scammers mainly target expensive prod-

drop. In the case that stolen credit cards are used to buy prepaid cards
(which are then used to buy the actual goods), then the prepaid card
issuer will face ﬁnancial loss. While most cardholders appeared only
once or twice, others are used for ﬁve or more times (see Figure 5(b)),
increasing the damage done and the cybercriminals’ proﬁt before they
