ABSTRACT
Over the past two or three years, wireless cellular networks have be-
come faster than before, most notably due to the deployment of LTE,
HSPA+, and other similar networks. LTE throughputs can reach
many megabits per second and can even rival WiFi throughputs in
some locations. This paper addresses a fundamental question con-
fronting transport and application-layer protocol designers: which
network should an application use? WiFi, LTE, or Multi-Path TCP
(MPTCP) running over both?
We compare LTE and WiFi for transfers of different sizes along
both directions (i.e. the uplink and the downlink) using a crowd-
sourced mobile application run by 750 users over 180 days in 16
different countries. We ﬁnd that LTE outperforms WiFi 40% of the
time, which is a higher fraction than one might expect at ﬁrst sight.
We measure ﬂow-level MPTCP performance and compare it with
the performance of TCP running over exclusively WiFi or LTE
in 20 different locations across 7 cities in the United States. For
short ﬂows, we ﬁnd that MPTCP performs worse than regular TCP
running over the faster link; further, selecting the correct network
for the primary subﬂow in MPTCP is critical in achieving good
performance. For long ﬂows, however, selecting the proper MPTCP
congestion control algorithm is equally important.
To complement our ﬂow-level analysis, we analyze the trafﬁc
patterns of several mobile apps, ﬁnding that apps can be categorized
as “short-ﬂow dominated” or “long-ﬂow dominated”. We then record
and replay these patterns over emulated WiFi and LTE links. We ﬁnd
that application performance has a similar dependence on the choice
of networks as ﬂow-level performance: an application dominated
by short ﬂows sees little gain from MPTCP, while an application
with longer ﬂows can beneﬁt much more from MPTCP — if the
application can pick the right network for the primary subﬂow and
the right choice of MPTCP congestion control.

INTRODUCTION
Access to WiFi and cellular wireless networks are de rigueur
on mobile devices today. With the emergence of LTE, cellular
performance is starting to rival the performance of WiFi. Moreover,
when WiFi signal quality is low or in crowded settings, the anecdotal
experience of many users is that cellular performance may in fact be
considerably better than WiFi performance.
But just how good are LTE and WiFi networks in practice and
how do they compare with each other? Should applications and
transport protocols strive to select the best network, or should they
simply always use Multi-Path TCP (MPTCP) [21]? This paper seeks
to answer these questions empirically.
To answer these questions, we implemented a crowd-sourced
network measurement tool (Section 2) to understand the ﬂow-level
performance of TCP over WiFi and LTE in the wild from 16 different
countries over a 6-month period, encompassing 3624 distinct 1-
MegaByte TCP ﬂows. We used this data to measure transfer times
for different amounts of data transferred.
MPTCP isn’t widely deployed yet on most phones1. As a result,
we manually measured ﬂow-level MPTCP performance and com-
pared it with the performance of TCP running over exclusively WiFi
or LTE in 20 different locations, in 7 cities in the United States (Sec-
tion 3). Finally, to complement our empirical ﬂow-level analysis, we
used an existing record-and-replay tool to analyze (Section 4) and
run (Section 5) mobile apps on emulated cellular and WiFi links,
using it to study the impact of network selection on application
performance.
Our key ﬁndings are as follows:
1. Cellular networks outperform WiFi around 40% of the time in
our data set (Figure 3), a proportion considerably higher than
we had hypothesized.
2. For short ﬂows (100 KB or lower), MPTCP performs worse
than TCP (Figure 7b). Further, it is crucial to select the proper
network for the primary MPTCP subﬂow2. For instance, on
a 10 KB ﬂow, we found that the choice of the network for
the primary subﬂow can affect MPTCP throughput by upto
60% (Figure 8). For long ﬂows, selecting the proper conges-
tion control algorithm is also important: for a 1 MB ﬂow, for
instance, modifying only the congestion control algorithm,
while keeping the network used by the primary subﬂow ﬁxed
changes MPTCP throughput by 34% (Figures 13 and 14). On
the other hand, modifying only the network used by the pri-

mary subﬂow, while keeping the congestion-control algorithm
ﬁxed, changes throughput by 25%. (Figure 14)
3. Mobile app trafﬁc patterns largely fall into two groups (Fig-
ure 17). We refer to apps that tend to open several connections,
each transferring small amounts of data, as short-ﬂow dom-
inated apps, and we refer to apps that have fewer number
of connections but transfer large amounts of data on each as
long-ﬂow dominated apps.
4. For short-ﬂow dominated apps, MPTCP does not outperform
the best conventional “single-path” TCP (over either Wi-Fi
or LTE) (Figures 18 and 19). However, it is important to
choose the correct network for standard TCP. Our emulation
shows that selecting the proper network for single-path TCP
can reduce response time by 50% compared to the minimum
of the single-path TCP throughputs on LTE and WiFi. On the
other hand, using MPTCP reduces application response time
by only 35%.
5. For long-ﬂow dominated apps, MPTCP does help markedly,
provided the appropriate congestion-control algorithm is used
and the two links have roughly comparable speeds: our emula-
tion shows that using single path TCP with the correct choice
of network reduces application response time by 42%, while
using MPTCP with the proper congestion control can also
reduce response time by about 50% (Figures 20 and 21).
Our crowd-sourced network measurement tool, Cell vs WiFi, is
available for Android in the Google Play Store. All our measurement
data and analysis tools are available at http://web.mit.edu/

2. CELL VS WIFI MEASUREMENT
In September 2013, we published an Android app on Google Play,
called Cell vs WiFi (http://web.mit.edu/cell-vs-wifi).
Cell vs WiFi measures end-to-end WiFi and cellular network per-
formance and uses these measurements to tell smartphone users if
they should be using the cellular network or WiFi at the current time
and location. The app also serves as a crowd-sourced measurement
tool by uploading detailed measurement data to our server including
packet-level traces. Over a nine-month period since the app was
published, it attracted over 750 downloads. We collected over 10
GB of measurement data from 3632 distinct TCP connections over
this duration from these users.
2.1 Cell vs WiFi App
Figure 1 shows the user interface of Cell vs WiFi. Users can
choose to measure network performance periodically, or once per
click. Users can also set an upper bound on the amount of cellular

data that the app can consume; especially for devices on a limited
cellular data plan.
The ﬂow chart in Figure 2 shows a single measurement-collection
run. When the user clicks the Start button or the pre-set periodic
measurement timer expires, one run of measurement collection starts,
shown as Step 1 in the ﬁgure. If WiFi is available and the phone
successfully associates with an Access Point (AP), Cell vs WiFi
collects packet-level tcpdump traces for a 1 Mbyte TCP upload and
a 1 Mbyte TCP download between the mobile device and our server
at MIT.
After measuring WiFi, Cell vs WiFi turns off the WiFi interface
on the phone and attempts to automatically connect to the cellular
network. If the user has turned off the cellular data network, Cell vs
WiFi aborts the cellular measurement. If Cell vs WiFi successfully
connects to the cellular network, then in Step 3 , it collects a similar
set of packet-level tcpdump traces for both an upload and a download.
Once both WiFi and cellular network measurements are ﬁnished,
in Step 4 , Cell vs WiFi uploads the data collected during this
measurement run, together with the user ID (randomly generated
when a smartphone user uses the app for the ﬁrst time), and the
phone’s geographic location, to our server at MIT.
