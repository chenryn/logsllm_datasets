## Issue Summary
I have searched the issues in this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.

## Expected Behavior
Users should be able to check or uncheck a checkbox using both the mouse and keyboard. This includes being able to use the tab key to navigate to the checkbox and then the spacebar to toggle its state.

## Current Behavior
Currently, if the `onCheck` event handler is used, only the mouse can check or uncheck the checkbox. When using the tab key to select the checkbox and then pressing the spacebar, the checkbox does not respond as expected. 

However, if the `onClick` event handler is used instead of `onCheck`, both the mouse and keyboard work as intended. This behavior is counterintuitive because `onClick` typically suggests an action triggered by a mouse click, but it is actually more versatile in this case.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Create a checkbox on a page.
2. Use the `onCheck` event handler to call a function.
3. Navigate to the checkbox using the tab key.
4. Press the spacebar to try to check or uncheck the checkbox.

Our users report that this method does not work, or that it requires 3-5 attempts to take effect. In contrast, clicking the checkbox with a mouse works on the first attempt.

**Note:** A CodeSandbox reproduction is not provided, but I believe the issue should be easy to reproduce.

## Context
Some of our users prefer to use their keyboard for interacting with checkboxes.

## Environment
- Material-UI: 0.20
