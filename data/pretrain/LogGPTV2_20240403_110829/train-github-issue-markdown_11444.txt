  * [X ] I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
Some users like to use tabbing and keyboard to traverse through a page. Some
like to click. For checkboxes you should be able to use both to check or
uncheck the checkbox.
## Current Behavior
Currently, if you use onCheck, then only the mouse works to check or uncheck
the checkbox. Using the tab key to select the checkbox, then pressing say the
space bar to check or uncheck the checkbox does not work.
However, if you use onClick instead of onCheck, then both the mouse and the
keyboard works. However, this is counter-intuitive because onClick sounds more
like the one that would only work with the mouse, but it is the opposite.
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
Just create a Checkbox on a page, use onCheck to call a function and try to
tab into it and press the spacebar. Our users are telling us it doesn't work,
or that it takes them 3-5 times hitting the space bar before it takes affect.
But if they click on it with a mouse, it is the 1st time.
"If YOU DO NOT take time to provide a codesandbox.io reproduction, should the
COMMUNITY take time to help you?"  
No they do not need to take the time to write a reproduction, I think it
should be easy to do.
## Context
Just that we have some users that like to use their keyboard for checkbox
clicking.
