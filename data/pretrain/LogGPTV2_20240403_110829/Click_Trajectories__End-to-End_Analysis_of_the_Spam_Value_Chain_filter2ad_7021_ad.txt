### Order Completion and Fraud Concerns

Nearly 50% of the failed orders were from ZedCash, where we suspect that our large order volume triggered fraud concerns. Generally, such biases in the order completion rate do not affect our analysis, as our primary goal is to establish the connection between individual programs and their realization infrastructure. We obtained data from multiple transactions for each major program under study.

One merchant sent a follow-up email stating that our money had been refunded; however, this refund was not processed even three months later.

### Operational Protocol

We placed our purchases via VPN connections to IP addresses located in the geographic vicinity of the mailing addresses used. This precaution is necessary to avoid failing common fraud checks that evaluate consistency between IP-based geolocation, mailing address, and the Address Verification Service (AVS) information provided through the payment card association. During each purchase, we logged the full contents of any checkout pages, including their domain names and IP addresses, which often differed from the sites themselves. We provided contact email addresses hosted on domain names purchased specifically for this project, as several merchants did not allow popular web-based email accounts during the purchase process. We recorded all emails sent to these accounts, along with the domain names and IP addresses of any customer service sites provided. We also periodically logged into these sites to record the current status of our purchases. For physical goods, we always selected the quickest form of delivery, while software was provided via the Internet (with full information about the sites used for software fulfillment).

All our purchases were conducted using prepaid Visa payment cards contracted through a specialty issuer. As part of our relationship with the issuer, we maintained the ability to create new cards on demand and to obtain the authorization and settlement records for each transaction. A unique card was used for each transaction.

We had goods shipped to a combination of individual residences and a suite address provided by a local commercial mailbox provider. We regularly picked up, tagged, and photographed shipments, then stored them in a centralized secure facility on our premises. Software purchases were stored on a secure hard drive, checked for viruses using Microsoft Security Essentials and Kaspersky Free Trial, and compared against other copies of the same software (including a reference version that we owned).

### Legal and Ethical Considerations

The purchasing portion of our study involved careful consideration of legal and ethical concerns, particularly because this level of active involvement has not been common in the academic community. We worked with both our own project legal advisors and general counsel to design a protocol for purchasing, handling, analyzing, and disposing of these products within a legal framework that minimizes any risk of harm to others. While the full accounting of legal considerations is outside the scope of this paper, most of our efforts revolved around item selection and controls. For example, we restricted our pharmaceutical purchases to non-prescription goods such as herbal and over-the-counter products, and we restricted our software purchases to items for which we already possessed a site license (and communicated our intent with the publisher). We did not use any received products (physical or electronic), and, aside from a few demonstration lots, they are scheduled to be destroyed upon the completion of our analyses.

A remaining issue concerns the ethics of potentially supporting merchants who may be criminal or unethical. Since our study does not involve human subjects, our institutional review board did not deem it appropriate for their review. Our decision to proceed is based on our subjective evaluation, along with the implicit oversight we received from university counsel and administration. We believe that the potential value from better understanding their ecosystem vastly outweighs the potential harm, given that any implicit support of these merchants is small (no individual affiliate program received more than $277 from us).

### Analysis

A major goal of our work is to identify "bottlenecks" in the spam value chain: opportunities for disrupting monetization at stages where spammers have the fewest alternatives (and ideally where switching costs are high). In this section, we focus on analyzing the degree to which affiliate programs share infrastructure, considering both the click support (domain registration, name service, and web hosting) and realization (payment and fulfillment) phases of the spam value chain. We explore each of these in turn and then consider the potential effectiveness of interventions at each stage.

#### Click Support

As described in Section III, we crawled a broad range of domains, covering those found in over 98% of our spam feed URLs, and used clustering and tagging to associate the resulting websites with particular affiliate programs. This data, combined with our DNS crawler and domain WHOIS data, allowed us to associate each domain with an affiliate program and its various click support resources (registrar, set of name server IP addresses, and set of web hosting IP addresses). Before proceeding with our analysis, we highlight the subtleties that result from the use of website redirection.

**Redirection:** Some websites redirect visitors from the initial domain found in a spam message to one or more additional sites, ultimately resolving to the final webpage (we call the domain for this page the "final domain"). Thus, for such cases, one could choose to measure the infrastructure around the "initial domains" or the "final domains."

In our data, 32% of crawled URLs redirected at least once. Of these, roughly 6% used public URL shorteners (e.g., bit.ly), 9% used well-known "free hosting" services (e.g., angelfire.com), and 40% were to a URL ending in .html (typically indicating a redirect page installed on a compromised web server). The remainder often used low-quality "throw-away" domains, which are typically registered using random letters or combinations of words whenever the previous set's traffic-drawing potential is reduced due to blacklisting.

Given this, we chose to focus entirely on the final domains, as these represent the more valuable infrastructure most clearly operated by an affiliate.

**Network Infrastructure Sharing:** A spam-advertised site typically has a domain name that must be resolved to access the site. This name must be allocated via a registrar, who has the authority to shut down or take back a domain in the event of abuse. Additionally, spammers must provision servers to provide DNS and web services, which receive network access from ISPs who can disconnect clients violating terms of service policies or in response to complaints.

Figure 3 shows that network infrastructure sharing among affiliate programs, when it occurs, is concentrated in a small number of registrars and Autonomous Systems (ASes). Many registrars and ASes host infrastructure for just one or two affiliate programs, while only a small number host infrastructure for many affiliate programs. No single registrar or AS hosts infrastructure for a substantial fraction of the programs overall.

Specifically, Figure 3 shows the number of registrars (y-axis) that serve registered domains for a given number of affiliate programs (x-axis). Over 80 registrars, for instance, serve domains for a single affiliate program, while just two registrars (NauNet and China Springboard) serve domains for over 20 programs. For name servers and web servers, it shows the number of ASes hosting servers for a given number of affiliate programs. Over 350 and 450 ASes host DNS and web servers, respectively, for a single affiliate program; yet, just two and nine ASes host DNS and web servers, respectively, for over 20 programs (including Hanaro Telecom, China Communication, and ChinaNet).

Although most registrars and ASes host infrastructure for just one affiliate program, each program could still engage many such registrars to serve their domains and many such ASes to host their DNS and web servers. Figure 4 shows that, in general, programs do not distribute their infrastructure across a large set of registrars or ASes. For most programs, each uses only a small fraction of the registrars and ASes found in our data set. Specifically, Figure 4 shows the cumulative distribution of the fraction of registrars and ASes in our data set used by affiliate programs. For 50% of the affiliate programs, their domains, name servers, and web servers are distributed over just 8% or fewer of the registrars and ASes, respectively; and 80% of the affiliate programs have their infrastructure distributed over 20% or fewer of the registrars and ASes. Only a handful of programs distribute their infrastructure more widely.
