Challenge http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/waypoint-target-the-parent-
of-an-element-using-jquery has an issue. Please describe how to reproduce it,
and include links to screenshots if possible.
I've read the multiple issues classified as bugs where the child (#target1)
wasn't identified in the code but the parent (#left-well) was. I believe I
have the correct code and the background of the well is appearing red but
"Your left-well element should have a red background" is not checked as
correct. If I change the child to "#target3" my answer is accepted.
 $(document).ready(function() { $("#target1").css("color", "red");
$("#target1").prop("disabled", true); $("#target4").remove();
$("#target2").appendTo("#right-well"); $("#target5").clone().appendTo("#left-
well"); $("#target1").parent().css("background-color", "red"); });
