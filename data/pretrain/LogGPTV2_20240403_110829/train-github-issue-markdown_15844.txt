### Issue Description
When upgrading Next.js to versions `6.0.0` and `6.0.1-canary.1`, the `with-firebase-hosting` example encounters an error during the deployment process. The issue arises when running the `deploy` command.

### Expected Behavior
The project should deploy successfully without any errors.

### Current Behavior
The deployment process fails with the following error:

```sh
C:\projects\with-firebase-hosting>yarn deploy
yarn run v1.6.0
warning package.json: No license field
$ firebase deploy
=== Deploying to '****-app'...
i  deploying functions, hosting
Running command: npm run build-funcs && npm run build-app && npm run copy-deps && npm run install-deps
> with-firebase-hosting@3.0.0 build-funcs C:\projects\with-firebase-hosting
> babel "src/functions" --out-dir "dist/functions"
Error: Error: Cannot find module 'babel-preset-env' from 'C:\projects\with-firebase-hosting\src\functions'
- Did you mean "@babel/env"?

### Environment
| Technology | Version |
|------------|---------|
| Next.js    | 6.0.0 & 6.0.1-canary.1 |
| Node.js    | 8.11.1  |
| OS         | Windows 10 |

### Additional Notes
- I have searched the issues in this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
- The error suggests that the `babel-preset-env` module cannot be found. It may need to be updated or replaced with `@babel/preset-env`.

If you have any further details or steps to reproduce the issue, please provide them for better assistance.
