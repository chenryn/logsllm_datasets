choose to illustrate only the votes bins that had at least 10 downloads’ sam-
ples. As we can see, there is a connection between the number of downloads
and the votes. In particular, we see that the mean downloads per vote is
increasing for higher vote values (that is, number of ratings). This implies a
relationship between the app popularity (app downloads) and the user rat-
ings. To quantify this relationship we calculated the Pearson’s correlation
coe(cid:14)cient between the average downloads per vote and votes. The results
are summarized in Table 4.1.

Table 4.1: Pearson’s correlation coe(cid:14)cient products between app down-
loads and user rating for di(cid:11)erent appstores.
As we can see, there is a quite strong relationship between downloads
and user ratings for the three di(cid:11)erent appstores. This interesting result
implies that the average smartphone user tends to rate more often the most
popular applications. Thus, the app popularity can be re(cid:13)ected by user
ratings too. Moreover, it seems that user ratings boost the app popularity,
as in(cid:13)uences the user preferences. In other words, users are more likely to
download an app that have high number of rating than a poor rated one.

CHAPTER 4. APP POPULARITY
4.4 The In(cid:13)uence of the Cost
Although most of the appstores that we study o(cid:11)er all apps free of cost,
SlideMe provides both free and paid apps. The latter ones usually have
somewhat more advanced functionality and usually do not include adver-
tisements. To understand the download patterns of paid and free apps, we
plotted the distribution of downloads for free and paid apps separately. The

We see that paid apps clearly follow a power-law distribution: few apps have a
(relatively) large number of downloads, while a large number of apps have a tiny
number of downloads.
results are illustrated in Figure 4.7. Interestingly, we see that paid apps fol-
low more clearly a power-law distribution. This is probably due to the fact
that users are more selective when downloading paid applications. Thus,
less popular apps tend to stay that way and are deprived from any casual
downloads. On the contrary, free apps enjoy more downloads and even less
popular apps get a decent number of downloads. This inference is better
depicted in Figure 4.8, where we can see the CDF of downloads distribution
of paid and free apps at the end of our measurement period. We observe
that more than half of the paid apps (55%) have not receive any downloads.
There is a fairly large proportion of paid apps, which corresponds to 32%
of total paid apps, that have got a number of downloads ranges from 1 to
roughly 85 downloads and a very small percentage, the upper 3% in the
graph, that have received an amount of downloads from almost 130 to a
number greater 600,000. In contrast, the distribution of downloads for free
apps appear to be more uniform than this of paid apps. The most obvious
di(cid:11)erence is the fact that there is no free app with zero number of downloads.
Moreover, the largest percentage of the free apps have received a number of
downloads that ranges from 60 to almost 70,000 of downloads. There is a
very small fraction of applications (less than 1%) that have received almost
3 downloads, as well as a very small percentage (the upper 1% in the graph)

that has received a number of downloads up to 3,550,000. However the me-
dian free app has received about 1,600 downloads, while the median paid
app has no downloads at all. From the above graph, it is clear the obvious
conclusion that smartphone users prefer to download apps for free instead
of paying for them.

SlideMe appstore.
Further, we would like to see whether the popularity depends on the
app’s price. To this end, we compared the downloads of each app with its
respective price.
In Figure 4.9 we plot the average downloads per app’s
price (downloads are binned into prices) versus the corresponding prices.
We see that the correlation between these two quantities is -0.22 indicating
a negative relationship, which means that the higher the price of an app,
the lower the probability of such an app to become popular. The average
number of downloads for price bins greater than 50 (not shown in the (cid:12)gure)
is equal to zero. Moreover, in Figure 4.10 we plot the percentage of apps per
price bin versus price. Likewise, we (cid:12)nd there is also a negative correlation
between the amount of the apps, which are at the same price levels, and
their price. Consequently, most of developers seem to give lower prices to
their apps hoping to gain more popularity in the (cid:12)rst steps.

In Chapter 7, there is a more detailed study on paid apps, where we
explore how the income of paid apps is distributed among developers and
among di(cid:11)erent categories. We also attempt to outline the behavior of app
developers and recognize their di(cid:11)erent strategy patterns through statistics
and observations from our dataset. Finally, we try to estimate whether free
apps can make higher income from paid apps using di(cid:11)erent means than
pricing, such as through advertisements.

4.5 Stability of TOP-10 and TOP-100 Apps Through
Time
This section provides an analysis of the most popular apps of the four mon-
itored appstores through time. The main question we attempt to answer
is whether the most popular apps change considerably over time. For this
purpose, we calculated the top-10 and top-100 sets of apps in terms of pop-
ularity, for each day of our measurement interval (2 months).

unique applications found in top-10 sets is slightly greater than 10 for each
appstore. The only appstore that seems to deviate slightly from this behav-
ior appears to be AppChina with 23 unique apps in top 10. This implies
that the top-10 is su(cid:14)ciently stable through time for all these marketplaces.
A similar trend seems to exist for the top-100 set, as we see that the number
of unique apps found in the calculated top-100 sets is a little higher than
100. To better understand the degree of this stability, we calculated the set
di(cid:11)erence between every two successive top-10 and top-100 sets. For exam-
ple, suppose that the top-10 set of a given day is A and this of the next day
is B. The set di(cid:11)erence of A and B is de(cid:12)ned as the set of elements in A,
but not in B :
A n B = fx 2 Aj x =2 Bg
(4.1)
We can see in Table 4.2, that the percentage of this di(cid:11)erence in average,
for both top-10 and top-100 sets, is very low for all the appstores and ranges
from 0.3% to 4.7% for top-10, and from 0.3% to 1.7% for top-100, which in-
dicates a very stable top-10 and top-100 set of apps through time. Although
the top sets of most popular apps seem to be stable over time, it would be
interesting to see whether there are rearrangements of apps within them. In
order to investigate this possibility, we calculated the Dice Similarity Co-
e(cid:14)cient (DSC) between all consecutive top-10 and top-100 sets. The dice

spatial overlap between two sets, to 1, indicating a complete overlap. The
formula for the calculation of the DSC is as follows:

Table 4.2 shows that the average value of the dice coe(cid:14)cient for top-10 sets
is equal to 1 for 1Mobile and 0.9 for SlideMe, which indicates that there is
almost no rearrangements of the apps in these sets though time. For Anzhi
appstore, this value is 0.8 which indicates a small number of rearrangements
through time and in AppChina this number drops to 0.6, which suggests
that there are constant changes in the positions of the 10 most popular
applications. These changes seem to grow as we move to larger sets of apps.
For instance, the average dice coe(cid:14)cient of the top-100 sets for each appstore
has dropped by a percentage greater than or equal to 10%. Nevertheless, we
can say that SlideMe and 1Mobile constituted of a kernel of popular apps
that seems to be extremely stable through time, while Anzhi and AppChina
include a stable set of popular apps with continuous changes in ranking
order. This is better illustrated in Figure 4.11 which shows the CDF of Dice
coe(cid:14)cient values of the calculated top-100 sets of apps among the monitored
appstores. The ranges of CDF distribution for SlideMe and 1Mobile contain
higher Dice coe(cid:14)cient values than those of the Chinese appstores, which
indicates a more stable top-100 set of the former against the latter.

4.6 Summary
In this section we attempted to understand the popularity of smartphone
applications. We studied the app popularity based on the aggregate distri-
bution of applications’ downloads and we observed the presence of Pareto
Principle in all of our datasets. That is, a small number of apps have a
very large number of downloads, while the majority of applications has very
limited downloads. Moreover, we show that app popularity in all of our
datasets exhibit Zipf-like distributions with some deviations which are ap-
parently caused by the \fetch-at-most-once" behavior of the users (as shown
in other studies too). Moreover, we feel that these deviations are also caused
by a more general phenomenon, which we call \the clustering e(cid:11)ect" and is
related with the grouping of apps into di(cid:11)erent categories. We will further
explore the existence of this phenomenon in Chapter 5. Finally, we discussed
which parameters may a(cid:11)ect app popularity and we showed that there is
a relationship between user ratings and app downloads.
In addition, we
studied the e(cid:11)ect of pricing in app popularity and realized the app down-
loads’ distribution varies from free to paid apps. Finally, we investigated
the stability of most popular apps though time and noticed that top-10 and
top-100 apps seem to be quite stable over time.

User’s Temporal A(cid:14)nity to App Categories
In our next set of measurements we would like to explore whether the pre-
viously suggested clustering e(cid:11)ect hypothesis can be validated. That is,
we want to (cid:12)nd out whether a user that downloaded an app of a particu-
lar category, will download another app from the same category with high
probability. In other words, we are interested to (cid:12)nd out if users tend to
stay within a single category rather than switching to another one.
5.1 Temporal A(cid:14)nity probability
Although we did not have access to appstore logs and could not know which
apps were downloaded by each user, we used the comments accompanied by
rating which users made as an indication of users’ interests and ultimately
