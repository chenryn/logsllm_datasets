## Abstract
The prevalence of Internet advertising has made it a prime target for attackers. One common attack involves the use of trick banners, which employ social engineering techniques to lure users into clicking on deceptive fake links, potentially leading to malicious domains or malware. A recent trend is for attackers to imitate "download" or "play" buttons on popular file-sharing sites, such as one-click hosters, video-streaming sites, and BitTorrent sites, in an attempt to trick users into clicking on these fake banners instead of the genuine download link.

In this paper, we address the problem of automatically assisting Internet users in detecting malicious trick banners and identifying the correct download link. We present a set of features to characterize trick banners based on their visual properties, including image size, color, placement on the webpage, presence of animation effects, and consistency across multiple page loads. We have developed a tool called TrueClick, which uses image processing and machine learning techniques to build a classifier that can automatically detect trick banners on a webpage. Our approach requires no manual effort to compile blacklists, unlike current methods. Our experiments show that TrueClick improves correct link selection by a factor of 3.55 in the absence of other ad-blocking software and can detect trick banners missed by popular ad detection tools like Adblock Plus.

## 1. Introduction
Internet advertising, whether in traditional forms like web banners and email campaigns or more recent social media and mobile marketing, is a rapidly growing and lucrative business. Publishers and application developers find it increasingly easy to integrate advertising into their content, and consequently, attackers have leveraged this channel as an efficient mechanism for distributing malware. The computer security community has shown increasing interest in addressing critical security issues surrounding Internet advertising, such as sandboxing advertisements, resolving user privacy concerns, and preventing ad fraud.

While the security community has primarily focused on technical solutions, the human factor in Internet advertising and the class of attacks that exploit user perception have largely been unexplored. One well-known example is the widespread use of trick banners. These are advertisement banners designed to deceive and mislead users into clicking on them, potentially linking to a malicious domain or malware. While trick banners have traditionally come in the form of colorful and animated messages or pop-ups imitating application messages, a more recent and pervasive trend is to imitate "download" or "play" buttons on popular file-sharing sites.

Previous research has shown that even technically sophisticated users can be tricked by these banners, posing a significant security risk. Abuse of advertisement banners (also known as "malvertising") has been recognized as an effective attack vector. It has also been shown that simply buying ad space is an easy and effective way for attackers to spread malware and quickly victimize a large number of Internet users.

In this paper, we explore the problem of automatically assisting Internet users in detecting malicious trick banners, focusing on distinguishing fake download buttons found on popular file-sharing websites from genuine download links. We identify a set of visual features to characterize trick banners and leverage these features in an approach combining image processing and machine learning to automatically detect trick banners on a webpage.

We implement our system in a prototype Firefox browser extension called TrueClick, evaluate its effectiveness on a dataset of 259 banners collected from 88 file-sharing websites, and demonstrate that TrueClick achieves a 96.97% true positive rate with a false positive rate of 3.03%. Unlike state-of-the-art ad-blocking methods, our approach does not require a priori blacklisting of advertising domains or any other manual classification of known banners. After an initial training phase, it operates in a completely automated manner by analyzing the visual properties of banners. This makes our approach complementary to existing blacklisting methods and capable of identifying previously unknown trick banners.

In summary, our contributions include:
- Presenting five visual features that can be used to characterize trick banners and experimentally demonstrating their effectiveness.
- Proposing a novel methodology for automatically and reliably distinguishing trick banners from genuine download links using image processing and machine learning.
- Describing a prototype implementation of our solution as a Firefox browser extension called TrueClick.
- Evaluating the usability of TrueClick through a user study, showing a 3.55 factor improvement in the selection of benign links and the ability to detect trick banners missed by Adblock Plus.

## 2. Problem Statement
A trick banner is defined as any Internet advertising banner with a deceptive visual appearance, crafted to lure users into clicking on them. They often lack any indication of the advertiser's identity or the advertised product. Trick banners are known to blend well with the look and feel of the website they appear on and often imitate popular applications, operating system windows, and pop-up messages.

In this work, we focus on a specific class of trick banners: fake download buttons found on file-sharing websites, which have been shown to be effective at tricking even security-savvy users. Figure 1 shows various examples obtained from popular file-sharing services. The techniques we present are generic enough to be applied to other types of trick banners as well. Fake download buttons represent a contemporary manifestation of the general trick banner problem and pose a challenging research task due to their tight integration with the file-sharing sites they are displayed on.

For example, a sample trick banner from The Pirate Bay (Figure 1, lower left corner) displays identical replicas of the correct download links, making it particularly difficult to spot. Banner design for attracting users and maximizing click-through rates has been extensively studied in various fields. In this paper, the term "trick banner" can refer to images with either benign or malicious intent. Our goal is to detect trick banners regardless of their purpose and distinguish them from legitimate download links.

We consider two threat scenarios:
1. An Internet user visits a file-sharing website with the intention to download a specific file. The pages can contain any number of trick banners and regular advertisements, along with one or more correct download buttons.
2. The website does not contain any correct download links, possibly as part of a scam scheme to trick search engines and steal clicks for ad revenue.

In both cases, our system analyzes the webpage and determines the regions containing trick banners. If trick banners are detected, they can be marked with warning cues or blocked, depending on implementation choices or user preferences.

Finally, we note that there are other types of attacks, such as clickjacking, which compromise the system's integrity. In contrast, trick banners exploit weaknesses in human perception. While defenses against both types of attacks are necessary, we focus on the latter in this work.

## 3. Background & Related Work
Before explaining our approach to trick banner detection, we review related work and the state-of-the-art in this field to highlight the differences between our work and current advertisement detection systems.

### Internet Advertising and Trick Banners
There is extensive prior work on Internet advertising and the technologies around it, both in computer science and other non-technical fields. The effectiveness of various types of ad banners and ways to influence user click-through behavior have been widely studied in marketing, finance, psychology, and related fields. Recent work by Onarlioglu et al. [37] investigated the computer security implications of trick banners and showed that they can mislead even technically sophisticated users.

### Advertisement Blocking and Filtering
A simple method of blocking trick banners and advertisements is through blacklisting. However, this requires manual effort to maintain and update blacklists. Our approach, TrueClick, automates the detection process by analyzing the visual properties of banners, making it a complementary and more dynamic solution.
