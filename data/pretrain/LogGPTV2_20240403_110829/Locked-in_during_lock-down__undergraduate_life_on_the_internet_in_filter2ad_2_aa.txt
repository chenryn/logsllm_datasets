ABSTRACT
Governments around the world enacted stay-at-home orders in
response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which changed many aspects
of life, including how people interacted with the Internet. These
draconian restrictions on in-person social interactions were perhaps
most acutely felt by people living alone. We study the changes in
network traffic of one such population, students remaining in the
(single-occupancy) on-campus dormitories at a large residential
educational institution during the onset and initial few months of
the lock-down. Specifically, we analyze how students shifted their
online work and leisure behaviors at an application level. Further,
we segment the population into domestic and international students,
and find that even within these two broad sub-populations, there
are significant differences in Internet-based behavior. Our work
provides a focused lens on pandemic Internet usage, examining
both 1) a concentrated user population and 2) the differing impacts
of a global pandemic on disparate sub-populations.

INTRODUCTION

The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted many aspects of life across 
the  globe,  but  perhaps  the  most  significant i mpact w as f elt by
those under government-mandated stay-at-home orders. While 
enforcement varied widely across jurisdictions, many impacted 
populations were forced to spend almost all of their time in their 
residence, with little-to-no in-person social interactions. While
such circumstances have occurred in the past, rarely have they 
applied to such privileged populations, with so little notice, and
for such extended periods of time. Moreover, for those individuals 
living alone in Internet-connected homes, the pandemic presents a

unique opportunity to study the (changing) role that the Internet—
and various application classes in particular—plays when it provides
the main form of outside interaction in their lives.
We present the first measurement study of a pandemic-induced
natural experiment: “How does university students’ Internet usage
change when they are forced to remain in their individual residences
with almost no in-person contact?” In particular, we report on the
network usage of several thousand mostly undergraduate students
at UC San Diego, a major residential research university over a
four-month period before, during, and after the onset of COVID-19.
These students were in a very real sense “trapped” in their dorm
room for the duration of the academic term and ostensibly had
nowhere to go, as the university asked all residents to return home
shortly after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a
pandemic (and international air travel ground to a halt), but before
the issuance of a region-wide stay-at-home-order.
The Internet was likely the dominant—if not exclusive—means
of interaction for the vast majority of these students. While cam-
pus policies regarding student movement varied during the four
months of our study, congregating in groups larger than three was
forbidden once the lock-down began, as were on-campus visitors.
Though the university provides cable TV service, and many if not
all students have cell phones (there are no land-line phones in
the dormitories), TV is a one-way medium, and most modern cell
phones preferentially operate on WiFi when available. We assume
that students’ phone-based Internet activity is captured by our net-
work tap, although we cannot exclude that some students may have
used their own, self-paid cellular data plans (or other, more fringe
technologies) for portions of their connectivity.
Within this captive audience, we analyze Internet usage both in
aggregate and across application classes. In particular, we are able
to understand how work and leisure changed for many of these
students at an application level, and provide a finer granularity of
analysis than previous work. Classes at the university transitioned
to an online modality shortly after the beginning of the pandemic,
so the students’ in-class engagement is well captured by their use
of UC San Diego’s favored tool, Zoom. Recreationally, we are able
to segregate traffic by device type, and identify a large number
of IoT devices and game consoles. Moreover, by geolocating the
sites they visit, we are able to segregate the student population into
(presumed) domestic and international students, and report upon
differences in their behaviors.
Overall, we find several distinct trends. While aggregate network
traffic initially spikes in April near the beginning of the pandemic,
it returns to near pre-pandemic levels by May, although not for all
applications. Moreover, we find that international students spend
less time on US-based social media applications than their domestic

counterparts, but spend more time on Steam, which highlights
the importance of separating sub-populations within analyses. In
sum, our study adds a unique additional perspective to the growing
corpus of COVID-19 Internet measurements.
2 RELATED WORK
A great deal has been published about Internet traffic during the
COVID-19 pandemic, but generally from the perspective of large
network or service operators. Their network-wide, or, conversely,
service-only vantage points prevent them from painting a coherent
picture regarding the network activities of any particular user group.
Perhaps the most comprehensive published report uses ISP and IXP
data to study how the volume of different traffic classes changed
throughout the pandemic [7]. Some of their overall findings—such
as the convergence of diurnal patterns to that of pre-pandemic
weekends—are not apparent in our population, while others—like
the increase in gaming and video conferencing—are clearly visible.
We frequently present our results in a similar style, and, where
relevant and possible, report over the same time periods (e.g., we
report traffic volume for the same four weeks, substituting the week
of May 14, 2020 for June 18, 2020 to stay within our academic term).
Others have also reported on network traffic at educational in-
stitutions, notably Favale et al. [6], who focus on the prevalence of
remote-work tools such as VPNs, Microsoft Teams, and their uni-
versity’s custom teaching software. However, their study reports
on the traffic of the entire university population across multiple
campuses, not just residents; staff and faculty presumably were not
living in their offices during the pandemic. While we find a similar
dramatic uptick in educational technology tools, we are able to
report on the recreational aspect of students’ activities as well.
Network and service operators have published both the impacts
of the pandemic on their services and their reactions to them [3,
10, 12]. Indeed, most reports—both in the peer-reviewed literature
and the blogosphere—suggest the network itself held up well under
the changing demand. For example, a study of Italian network
operators [4] found that they were proactive in expanding network
capacity, primarily through an increase in hardware resources, in
order to match increased demand. A study examining the response
of ISP providers in the United States affirms this increase in traffic,
but notes that network utilization returns to pre-pandemic levels in
part due to ISP capacity augmentation [11]. While we similarly find
a marked increased in per-capita demand among students after the
campus shutdown, the sharp decline in residential user population
led to a decrease in overall network traffic.
The use of social media during COVID-19 has also been studied
in an analysis of YouTube video sharing on Twitter [13]. This anal-
ysis finds a high negative correlation between media sharing and
mobility; we similarly find that our “trapped” users greatly increase
their social media and overall Internet usage.
3 DATA SOURCES
Our study focuses on the devices used by the residential campus
population (primarily undergraduates) at UC San Diego between
February 1, 2020 to May 31, 2020. A range of circumstances, notably
the quick onset of pandemic travel restrictions and lock-downs, left
many undergraduates trapped on campus where they were required
481
to isolate in their on-campus residences. This situation provides a
unique context for analyzing Internet-traffic usage which we were
able to investigate using a passive monitoring infrastructure already
in place at UC San Diego [5].
There are three primary components that serve as inputs for our
data set: 1) raw bidirectional network traffic from the campus net-
work, 2) DHCP logs, and 3) DNS resolutions. The raw network traffic
is mirrored from a switch connecting the on-campus residences to
the campus backbone, but specifically excludes traffic from certain
networks due to high traffic volumes; excluded networks include
parts of UC San Diego, Google Cloud, Amazon, Microsoft Azure,
Riot Games, Twitch, Qualys, and Apple.
The system uses Zeek [17] to extract flows from the set of con-
nections between each device and remote server. Devices in the
network are assigned dynamic, temporary IP addresses by DHCP,
which we normalize using contemporaneous DHCP logs to convert
these dynamic IP address to per-device MAC addresses. To protect
user privacy, the IP and MAC addresses for the devices we study are
anonymized, and the raw data is discarded after being processed.
As well, to avoid analyzing traffic from campus visitors we discard
information for devices that appear on the network for fewer than
14 days. In addition, we use contemporaneous DNS logs to convert
remote IP addresses (i.e., the servers communicating with the de-
vices we study) to domain names (hence, allowing us to distinguish
between different services in use). Finally, we classify individual
on-campus MAC devices as being desktop, mobile or IoT devices
using multiple heuristics, including analysis of User-Agent strings
and organizationally unique identifiers (OUIs) extracted from traffic
data. For IoT devices specifically, we employ the methods devised
by Saidi et al. with a threshold of 0.5 [15]. Such heuristics are in-
herently imperfect, so to estimate the error in our approach we
manually reviewed 100 random devices in our dataset and verified
that 84 were correctly classified.1 Further details about this col-
lection pipeline, including the device classification approach, are
provided by Dekoven et al. [5]. Our data collection and privacy
controls have been reviewed and approved by a range of campus
oversight entities including UC San Diego’s institutional review
board (IRB), our campus-wide cybersecurity governance committee,
and our campus network operations and cybersecurity groups. In
particular, because we do not collect identifiable information about
individual users and report results in aggregate, our study has been
declared exempt by our IRB.
4 AGGREGATE ANALYSIS
First, we analyze population-level changes and explain how that
affects our subsequent analysis. Many students left campus during
March 2020, as seen in Figure 1. This graph plots the number of
devices active for each day; devices are more likely to have network
activity on weekdays than weekends, creating regular dips and
spikes. However, this graph shows that students started leaving
campus even before classes became fully remote. Before the shut-
down, there was a peak of 32,019 active devices; this dipped to a
low of 4,973 active devices during the shutdown.
1Only two devices in this sample were affirmatively misclassified (e.g. labeling a device
as laptop when it was actually a desktop) and the dominant source of error (14 devices)
was omission (i.e., devices conservatively classified as”unknown”).

by device type.
Figure 2: The average and median bytes of active devices per
day by device type.
The important dates, indicated by dark vertical lines in our
graphs, are as follows:
• 3/4/20: regional authorities issue a state of emergency
• 3/11/20: WHO declares COVID-19 to be a pandemic
• 3/19/20: regional authorities issue a stay-at-home order
• 3/22/20: academic break starts
• 3/30/20: academic break ends; classes resume online
We also examine the distribution of devices by device type in
this graph. The number of desktop/laptop and mobile devices on
campus seem to follow a 1:1 ratio. After the campus shutdown,
the number of unclassified devices dominates the number of IoT,
mobile, and desktop/laptop devices2.
To understand how much traffic each type of device generates,
we plot the mean and median bytes per device in Figure 2. We
note that some high-volume traffic devices skew the means to be

describe in the previous section; while further analysis is required, we suspect that
they are actually mobile and desktop devices with large outliers in device behavior.

much greater than the medians; this is especially noticeable for
IoT and unclassified devices, where the difference spans several
orders of magnitude. As a result, the rest of the analysis in this
work will rely on median values. The median traffic in this graph
shows that while unclassified devices dominate in number, they do
not dominate in volume of traffic. Instead, pre-shutdown mobile
devices dominate, and post-shutdown mobile and desktop/laptop
devices exhibit roughly equal volumes of traffic.
We find 6,522 devices in total remained on campus after the
shutdown; we refer to this group of devices as post-shutdown users.
Our subsequent analyses focus on these devices to ensure that
changes we see in the data reflect changes due to the COVID-19
shutdown, and not changes due to a shift in demographics.
4.1 Overall Internet Usage
As students spent more time indoors and less time socializing, time
spent online drastically increased. This change is reflected in the
total volume of traffic, which increases by 58% from February to
April and May 2020. Traffic in April and May 2020 was 53% higher
than in 2019, which indicates that the pandemic was a driving factor
behind these changes. Furthermore, on average, users visited 34%
more distinct sites in April and May 2020 than in February 2020,
which shows users expanded the range of sites they visited.
Notably, however, the weekend dips in traffic persist—a trend
not found in other measurement studies of this time period, such
as by Feldmann et al. [7]. Figure 3 shows how the hourly volume
of traffic changed over the course of the early pandemic months;
the data is normalized by the minimum volume of traffic across all
weeks. This graph shows that on weekdays during the shutdown,
traffic spikes earlier in the day and peaks at higher volumes than
in February. In contrast, weekends are relatively unchanged.
4.2 Student population
We hypothesize that foreign students are over-represented in the set
of post-shutdown users because it would have been more difficult
for these students to find flights to return home at the start of the
