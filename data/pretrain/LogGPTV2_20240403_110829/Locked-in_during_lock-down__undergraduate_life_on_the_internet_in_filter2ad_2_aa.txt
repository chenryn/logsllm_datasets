## Abstract
Governments worldwide implemented stay-at-home orders in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, significantly altering many aspects of daily life, including internet usage. These restrictions were particularly challenging for individuals living alone. This study examines the changes in network traffic among students who remained in single-occupancy on-campus dormitories at a large residential educational institution during the initial months of the lockdown. We analyze how students shifted their online work and leisure behaviors at an application level. Additionally, we segment the population into domestic and international students, revealing significant differences in internet-based behavior between these sub-populations. Our work provides a focused analysis of pandemic-induced internet usage, examining both a concentrated user population and the disparate impacts of a global pandemic on different sub-populations.

## Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted many aspects of life globally, with the most significant impact felt by those under government-mandated stay-at-home orders. While enforcement varied, many populations were confined to their residences with minimal in-person social interactions. This situation, unprecedented in its scale and duration, provided a unique opportunity to study the role of the internet, especially for individuals living alone. 

This study presents the first measurement of a natural experiment: "How does university students' internet usage change when they are forced to remain in their individual residences with almost no in-person contact?" We report on the network usage of several thousand undergraduate students at UC San Diego over a four-month period before, during, and after the onset of the pandemic. These students were effectively "trapped" in their dorms, with the university asking all residents to return home shortly after the WHO declared a pandemic, but before a region-wide stay-at-home order was issued.

The internet became the primary, if not exclusive, means of interaction for these students. Campus policies restricted group gatherings and on-campus visitors, and while the university provided cable TV and many students had cell phones, the internet was the dominant medium for communication and entertainment. We analyze internet usage both in aggregate and across application classes, providing a detailed view of how work and leisure activities changed for these students.

## Related Work
Numerous studies have examined internet traffic during the COVID-19 pandemic, primarily from the perspective of large network or service operators. These studies often lack a coherent picture of specific user groups. One comprehensive report used ISP and IXP data to study changes in traffic volume [7]. Some findings, such as the convergence of diurnal patterns to pre-pandemic weekends, were not evident in our population, while others, like increased gaming and video conferencing, were clearly visible. We present our results in a similar style, reporting over the same time periods where possible.

Other studies have focused on network traffic at educational institutions, such as Favale et al. [6], who examined the use of remote-work tools. However, their study covered the entire university population, not just residents. We find a similar uptick in educational technology tools but also provide insights into recreational activities.

Network and service operators have reported on the pandemic's impact and their responses [3, 10, 12]. Most reports suggest that networks held up well under changing demand. For example, Italian network operators expanded capacity through hardware resources [4], and U.S. ISPs noted a return to pre-pandemic levels due to capacity augmentation [11]. We similarly find a marked increase in per-capita demand among students, but overall network traffic decreased due to the sharp decline in the residential user population.

Social media usage during the pandemic has also been studied, with one analysis finding a high negative correlation between media sharing and mobility [13]. We similarly observe that our "trapped" users greatly increased their social media and overall internet usage.

## Data Sources
Our study focuses on the devices used by the residential campus population (primarily undergraduates) at UC San Diego from February 1, 2020, to May 31, 2020. The rapid onset of travel restrictions and lockdowns left many undergraduates isolated on campus. We analyzed internet traffic using a passive monitoring infrastructure already in place at UC San Diego [5].

The dataset includes:
1. Raw bidirectional network traffic from the campus network, excluding high-traffic networks.
2. DHCP logs to convert dynamic IP addresses to MAC addresses.
3. DNS resolutions to convert remote IP addresses to domain names.

We classify devices as desktop, mobile, or IoT using heuristics, including User-Agent strings and OUIs. For IoT devices, we use methods by Saidi et al. [15]. To protect privacy, IP and MAC addresses are anonymized, and raw data is discarded after processing. Devices active for fewer than 14 days are excluded. Our data collection and privacy controls have been reviewed and approved by UC San Diego's IRB, cybersecurity governance committee, and network operations groups.

## Aggregate Analysis
### Population-Level Changes
Many students left campus in March 2020, as seen in Figure 1, which shows the number of active devices per day. Before the shutdown, there was a peak of 32,019 active devices, which dropped to a low of 4,973 during the shutdown. The graph also indicates that the number of desktop/laptop and mobile devices on campus followed a 1:1 ratio, with unclassified devices dominating post-shutdown.

### Traffic Volume
To understand traffic generation, we plot the mean and median bytes per device in Figure 2. High-volume traffic devices skew the means, so we focus on medians. Median traffic shows that while unclassified devices dominate in number, they do not dominate in traffic volume. Pre-shutdown mobile devices dominated, and post-shutdown, mobile and desktop/laptop devices exhibited roughly equal volumes of traffic.

### Overall Internet Usage
As students spent more time indoors, internet usage increased. Total traffic volume increased by 58% from February to April and May 2020, 53% higher than in 2019. Users visited 34% more distinct sites in April and May 2020 compared to February 2020, indicating an expansion in the range of sites visited. Notably, weekend dips in traffic persisted, a trend not found in other studies. Figure 3 shows hourly traffic volume, normalized by the minimum volume across all weeks, indicating earlier and higher weekday traffic peaks during the shutdown, with relatively unchanged weekends.

### Student Population
We hypothesize that foreign students are over-represented in the post-shutdown user group due to difficulties in finding flights home. Further analysis will explore this hypothesis.
