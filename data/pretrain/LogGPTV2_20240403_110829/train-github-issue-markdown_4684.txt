Subject: Node Dropouts in Elasticsearch 5.0.0 and 5.1.1 on Windows 2008 R2

Dear Support Team,

I am experiencing an issue with nodes dropping out of my Elasticsearch cluster after upgrading from version 2.4.1 to 5.0.0, and subsequently to 5.1.1. The environment details are as follows:

- **Elasticsearch Version:** 5.0.0 (upgraded to 5.1.1)
- **JVM Version:** 1.8.102 (updated to 1.8.112)
- **Operating System:** Windows Server 2008 R2
- **Cluster Configuration:** 6 data nodes, 1 ingest node, and 1 master node

### Issue Description

Since the upgrade to Elasticsearch 5.0.0, I have been encountering a problem where data nodes randomly drop out of the cluster. This issue is not observed on the ingest and master nodes. However, when I enable an ingest node as a data node, it starts to exhibit the same problem.

### Symptoms

- **Node Dropout:** Data nodes drop out of the cluster at random times.
- **Logging:** The logs only show that the node left and rejoined. Increasing the logging level to debug does not provide additional information. Even the usual 10-second Marvel metrics shipping stops logging.
- **Connection Issues:** Attempting to access the hot threads via port 9200 results in a connection timeout.
- **CPU Spike:** A 100% CPU spike occurs, lasting from a few seconds to a few minutes, but the system recovers on its own.
- **Disk I/O:** Disk I/O activity is minimal during these events.
- **Simplified Cluster:** Reducing the cluster to 2 data nodes and removing 95% of the indexes to accommodate only the current daily indexes did not resolve the issue. No searches are occurring during these events.

### Troubleshooting Steps

- **Service Conflicts:** I am currently disabling other Windows services to check for potential conflicts.
- **Thread Dumps:** I have captured thread dumps using Process Explorer and jstack. The thread dump was taken as soon as the jstack was able to connect and dump. The images and thread dumps are attached below.
