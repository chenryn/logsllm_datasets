Abstract 
communications 
The  panel  session  will  cover  current  issues  and 
problems in wireless security and approaches to 
dealing with them. 
Wireless Security 
Wireless 
and  wireless 
computing devices are now commonly used and 
are  becoming  even  more  widespread.    Several 
well-publicized  events  and  discoveries  over  the 
last  couple  of  years  have  clearly  shown  that 
security  for  the  wireless  domain  is  a  definite 
problem.    Security  is  often  quite  inadequate. 
Many  network  administrators 
in  charge  of 
wireless  networks  do  not  even  enforce  any 
security.    Access  points  frequently  are  wide 
open.    When  security  of  one  sort  or  another  is 
put  in  place,  significant  gaps  and  holes  remain.  
For  example,  the  underlying  protocols  have 
difficulties  and  weaknesses.    Protocols  that  are 
related to wireless communications and security, 
including  WEP,  WEP2,  EAP,  and  802.1X,  all 
appear  to  need  strengthening  depending  upon 
what security is required.

Wireless  communications  naturally 
mobile  environments,  so  that  ad-hoc  networks 
come  into  play  and  for  security  reasons  trust 
relations  need  to  be  established  quickly.    How 
one  develops  such  trust  relations  that  can  be 
relied  upon  is  a  higher-level  problem  in  the 
wireless 
network 
infrastructure.  It is a problem of concern to the 
wireless user who wants reasonable assurance of, 
for example, confidentiality or privacy. 
The aim of this panel is to review briefly some of 
the  security  problems  and  vulnerabilities  for 
wireless communications and especially wireless 
computing  and  then  explore  some  of  promising 
proposed countermeasures for them.  It is time to 
take  stock  of  where  we  are  with  providing 
security  to  the  community  and  to  see  where  we 
can  do  better.    For  the  panel  session  we  will 
cover the following:
