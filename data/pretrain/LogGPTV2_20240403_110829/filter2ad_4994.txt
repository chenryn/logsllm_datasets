## Abstract
This panel session will address the current issues and challenges in wireless security, as well as explore potential solutions to these problems.

## Introduction
Wireless networks and computing devices have become ubiquitous, with their usage continuing to expand. However, several high-profile incidents over the past few years have highlighted significant security vulnerabilities in the wireless domain. Security measures are often inadequate, and many network administrators do not enforce even basic security protocols. Access points are frequently left open, and when security measures are implemented, they often have significant gaps and weaknesses. For instance, the underlying protocols, such as WEP, WEP2, EAP, and 802.1X, all require enhancements to meet modern security standards.

In mobile environments, ad-hoc networks play a crucial role, necessitating the rapid establishment of trust relationships for security reasons. Developing reliable trust relations is a critical challenge in the wireless network infrastructure, particularly for users who require assurances of confidentiality and privacy.

The aim of this panel is to provide a brief overview of the security vulnerabilities in wireless communications, with a focus on wireless computing, and to discuss promising countermeasures. It is essential to evaluate our current state of providing security and identify areas for improvement.

## Panel Structure
The panel will cover the following topics:

1. **Review of the Current Wireless Security Situation:**
   - Overview of the primary security issues and vulnerabilities.
   - Discussion of the lack of security and the difficulties associated with existing procedures and protocols.

2. **Examination of Ongoing Efforts to Strengthen Wireless Security:**
   - Exploration of the directions being taken to enhance the security of wireless networking infrastructure.
   - Analysis of the effectiveness of current and proposed security measures.

3. **Higher-Level Concerns and Approaches:**
   - Examination of the challenges and approaches related to security in ad-hoc networks.
   - Strategies for managing trust in mobile and dynamic environments.

## Panelists
- **Dale Johnson (Chair),** The MITRE Corporation
- **Bruce Potter,** VeriSign, Inc.
- **Viren Shah,** Cigital
- **Vipin Swarup,** The MITRE Corporation

## Conclusion
The panel session aims to provide a comprehensive review of the current state of wireless security, identify key vulnerabilities, and explore effective countermeasures. By addressing these issues, we can work towards enhancing the security of wireless networks and ensuring the privacy and confidentiality of users.
