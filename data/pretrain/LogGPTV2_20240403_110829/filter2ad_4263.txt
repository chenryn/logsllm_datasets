INTRODUCTION
IP spooﬁng weakens network security and accountability. Al-
though a lot of techniques have been proposed to prevent IP spoof-
ing, most of them are not implemented by device vendors, and the
only available anti-spooﬁng tool in practice is ingress ﬁltering [3].
However, ISPs do not have incentives to deploy ingress ﬁltering
as it only prohibits a deployer from sending spooﬁng trafﬁc, but it
hardly protects the deployer from receiving spooﬁng trafﬁc. Recent
research shows that the deployment of ingress ﬁltering hasn’t been
improved in four years, and the Internet is still vulnerable to IP
spooﬁng [2].
The reason that ingress ﬁltering lacks deployment incentive can
also be explained from an economic perspective, i.e. deploying
ingress ﬁltering is not proﬁtable, because it introduces extra opera-
tional cost without generating sufﬁcient revenue for the deployers.
In this paper, we seek to increase the deployers’ economic revenue
to incentivize the deployment of ingress ﬁltering.
Our proposal is Filtering as a Service (FaaS), a mechanism that
creates a market for the IP spooﬁng prevention service. As shown
in Figure 1, an Autonomous System (AS) in need of IP spooﬁng
prevention (FaaS customer, or f -customer) can purchase the service
from any AS who has deployed ingress ﬁltering (f -provider). An f -
customer beneﬁts from its f -providers, and rewards them with ser-
vice payments. An f -provider deploys ingress ﬁltering, and opens a
source of revenue by providing ﬁltering service. Different from tra-
ditional ingress ﬁltering, which drops any detected spooﬁng packet,
an f -provider only ﬁlters the spooﬁng packets for its f -customers
(speciﬁcally the spooﬁng packets whose dstIP or srcIP belong to
its f -customers) to prevent free riders.
A deployer gains more revenue with FaaS than it does on the
current Internet. On the current Internet, an AS deploying ingress
ﬁltering beneﬁts all the ASes on the Internet, but it can only receive
rewards from its customer ASes (e.g. the customers may prefer or
even pay more for securer service). With FaaS, the deployer can

receive rewards from any AS who is concerned about IP spooﬁng
and would like to purchase its service. Since the deployers can gain
higher revenue, it can be expected that more ASes will be motivated
to deploy ingress ﬁltering, and the spooﬁng trafﬁc on the Internet
can be further mitigated.
2. PRELIMINARY DESIGN
In this section we present a preliminary design of FaaS, which
consists of three components, an online trading platform, an ac-
counting system and a consulting system.
2.1 Online Trading Platform
Since ingress ﬁltering only works well near network edges, an f -
customer has to purchase the ﬁltering service from many f -providers,
most of whom are geographically distant, which makes ofﬂine trad-
ing too expensive. Thus an online trading platform is needed to
lower the trading cost. Different from today’s C2C e-commerce
platforms like eBay, a trader must prove that he or she is the legal
representative of a particular AS who owns the the AS number and
the IP address blocks. RPKI can be used as this proof, since it is
standardized by IETF and steadily being deployed.
2.2 Accounting System
Without an accounting system, a malicious f -provider may cheat
its f -customers, i.e. charges them but doesn’t ﬁlter for them. This
cheating is feasible because, when a f -customer is under a spooﬁng
attack, it cannot tell which f -provider should be responsible for the
attack. Thus, we design a third party distributed probing system,
which periodically generates a modest amount of spooﬁng probes
to explore the malicious f -providers. As in the example shown
in Figure 1, t tests whether p2 ﬁlters for d properly by emitting
spooﬁng probes (t, s, d), whose TTL expires after passing p2. If t
receives any ICMP TTL Exceeded messages, it knows that (t, s, d)
is not ﬁltered by p2, and p2 could be a malicious f -provider. A
concrete design of the probing system is our future work.
2.3 Consulting System
The consulting system helps an f -customer to choose an optimal
set of f -providers to maximize its beneﬁt (protection), and evaluates

Assuming that ﬁltering a spooﬁng ﬂow (a, s, d) has a beneﬁt of
w(a, s, d), ﬁltering the spooﬁng ﬂows whose dstIP or srcIP is c
makes the beneﬁt of c, which c wants to maximize. Intuitively, c
can purchase the ﬁltering service from all the f -providers to max-
imize its beneﬁt. However, as shown in Figure 1, since a spooﬁng
ﬂow can be ﬁltered by multiple f -providers, purchasing the service
from all the f -providers implies that c pays for ﬁltering a same ﬂow
for more than once, and c wants to keep this redundant payment
rate under a threshold µ. Thus c’s goal is to maximize its beneﬁt
under the redundant payment rate constraint. The consulting sys-
tem solves this maximization problem by ﬁnding an optimal set of
f -providers for c.
An f -provider p’s f -customers are simply the ASes who choose
p as their f -provider. Given the deterministic algorithm of ingress
ﬁltering, the beneﬁt that p offers to its f -customers can also be com-
puted, denoted by Bp. Similarly, we can compute the beneﬁt that p
offers to its customers with the traditional deployment on the Inter-
net, denoted by B′
p. Assuming that the reward an AS pays to p is
a constant fraction of the beneﬁt that it gains from p, we can ﬁnaly
quantify that FaaS increases p’s revenue by Bp/B′
p times.

Recall that FaaS increases a deployer’s revenue by allowing it to
get rewards from more ASes. If an AS p, who has m customers,
can attract all the other ASes to purchase its service, we can roughly
estimate that its revenue can be increased by n−1
times. This spec-
ulation is veriﬁed in Figure 2b, which shows that the average rev-
enue increase across the ASes with the same number of customers
has a linear correlation with n−1
(correlation coefﬁcient is 0.9898).
The ﬁtted arverage revenue increase is ARI = 0.5347 n−1
, which
can be used as a simpliﬁed estimation of revenue increase in a new
topology. The slope is less than 1 becuase a deployer transits more
trafﬁc and offers more beneﬁt for its customers than other ASes,
and thus it can receive more payments from its customers. The rea-
son that we set µ = 0.2 has been explained in the last paragraph,
and we set ν = 1 for a cross comparison with the current Internet.
Most f -providers can have n − 1 f -customers under this setting.

Finally we evaluate how well FaaS can mitigate the global spoof-
ing trafﬁc. As shown in Figure 2c, when µ = 0.2, 99.55% of the
global spooﬁng trafﬁc can be ﬁltered while each deployer’s revenue
at least doubled (ν = 2), and the mitigation is 82.86% when each
deployer’s revenue is increased by at least 4 times (ν = 4). The
marginal improvement in mitigation is trivial when µ > 0.2, which
indicates that 0.2 redundant payment is enough for the f-customers
to choose sufﬁcient f-providers to ﬁlter most spooﬁng trafﬁc.
3. SIMULATION
4. CONCLUSION
In this section, we investigate the effectiveness of FaaS in in-
creasing the deployers’ revenue and mitigating global spooﬁng traf-
ﬁc by simulation. In the simulation, we assume that an AS will
deploy ingress ﬁltering if its revenue is increased by ν times; oth-
erwise it won’t deploy. We also assume that every AS concerns
IP spooﬁng. The simulation is based on an AS-level topology, as
same as the one used in [4]. We assign the spooﬁng ﬂows with uni-
form and variant1 ﬁltering beneﬁt respectively. The results show
high similarity between the two assignments, and we only show
the results of the uniform assignment due to the lack of space.
The deployers’ revenue increase is shown in Figure 2a. When
µ (the constraint on f -customers’ redundant payment rate) is 0,
the f -providers’ revenue is lower because the f -customers are very
conservative in choosing f -providers to avoid any extra payment.
When µ = 0.2, the revenue increase is higher, and about 90% of
deployers’ revenue is increased by more than 100 times. We be-
lieve that 0.2 redundant payment is affordable for the f -customers,
because the Return On Investment is strong enough2. The ﬁgure
also shows that the higher ν (deployers’ expectation of the revenue
increase) is, the higher the deployers’ revenue is, because there are
fewer f -providers and each f -provider can have more f -customers.

2The ROI in DDoS protection is 281% [1]. 0.2 extra payment re-
sults in the new ROI of 218%, which is still at a high level.
From the deployment progress of BGPSec, DNSSec and new
anti-spooﬁng methods, we learn the lesson that deploying new tech-
niques on the Internet infrastructure can be very challenging. In this
paper, we make use of the existing technique, ingress ﬁltering, to
mitigate IP spooﬁng. We solve the deployment incentive problem
of ingress ﬁltering from a new, economic perspective. The simu-
lation results show that our proposal can signiﬁcantly increase the
ISPs’ deployment incentive and mitigate the global spooﬁng trafﬁc.
