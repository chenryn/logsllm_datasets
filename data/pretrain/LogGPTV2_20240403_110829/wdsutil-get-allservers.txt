### get-AllServers

**Description:**
The `get-AllServers` command retrieves information about all Windows Deployment Services (WDS) servers in your environment.

**Note:**
- This command may take a significant amount of time to complete if there are many WDS servers in your environment.
- The execution time can also be affected by a slow network connection between the servers.

**Syntax:**
```plaintext
wdsutil [Options] /Get-AllServers /Show:{Config | Images | All} [/Detailed] [/Forest:{Yes | No}]
```

**Parameters:**

- **/Show:{Config | Images | All}**
  - **Config:** Displays configuration information for all WDS servers.
  - **Images:** Displays image information for all WDS servers.
  - **All:** Displays both configuration and image information for all WDS servers.

- **[/Detailed]**
  - When used with `/Show:Images` or `/Show:All`, this option returns detailed metadata for each image. If not specified, the default behavior is to return the image name, description, and file name.

- **[/Forest:{Yes | No}]**
  - **Yes:** Searches for WDS servers across the entire forest.
  - **No:** Searches for WDS servers only in the current domain. This is the default behavior if the parameter is not specified.

**Examples:**

1. To view configuration information about all WDS servers:
   ```plaintext
   wdsutil /Get-AllServers /Show:Config
   ```

2. To view detailed information about all WDS servers, including images and forest-wide search:
   ```plaintext
   wdsutil /Verbose /Get-AllServers /Show:All /Detailed /Forest:Yes
   ```

By using these commands, you can efficiently manage and retrieve information about your WDS infrastructure.
