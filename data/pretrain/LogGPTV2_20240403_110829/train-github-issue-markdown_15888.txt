It has to do with FP but I think it is still precarious considering a 'small'
error changes the entire mesh.  
Following is an MWE
    >>>np.mgrid[0.:0.5+0.5/2:0.5/2, 0.:0.2+0.2/2:0.2/2].reshape(2,-1).T
    array([[ 0.  ,  0.  ],
           [ 0.  ,  0.1 ],
           [ 0.  ,  0.2 ],
           [ 0.  ,  0.3 ],
           [ 0.25,  0.  ],
           [ 0.25,  0.1 ],
           [ 0.25,  0.2 ],
           [ 0.25,  0.3 ],
           [ 0.5 ,  0.  ],
           [ 0.5 ,  0.1 ],
           [ 0.5 ,  0.2 ],
           [ 0.5 ,  0.3 ]])`
which is due to the FP representation of `0.1+0.2`
However if I use the following, I get the expected result
    >>> np.mgrid[0.:0.75:0.25, 0.:0.3:0.1].reshape(2,-1).T
    array([[ 0.  ,  0.  ],
           [ 0.  ,  0.1 ],
           [ 0.  ,  0.2 ],
           [ 0.25,  0.  ],
           [ 0.25,  0.1 ],
           [ 0.25,  0.2 ],
           [ 0.5 ,  0.  ],
           [ 0.5 ,  0.1 ],
           [ 0.5 ,  0.2 ]])`
A silly workaround would be use only the first few (~16) decimal places for
such cases but I do think that `float(format(0.1+0.2,'.16f'))` is not very
natural to many people
