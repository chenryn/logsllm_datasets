low, possibly because many of a user’s existing friends have not
yet joined. This causes social density to decrease. As users acquire
friends with a rate higher than the rate of new users in later part of
Phase I and the same trend continuing in Phase II, the social den-
sity increases. In Phase III, the number of users in Google+ had
a sudden jump due to the public release but the number friendship
links increases less dramatically, which once again causes the so-
cial density to drop signiﬁcantly around t=70, but then starts slowly
increasing again. Our ﬁndings have implications for network mod-
eling. Speciﬁcally, many network models either assume constant
density [5, 24] or power-law densiﬁcation [33], which is not con-
sistent with Google+.

day one to day 20, which corresponds to the early days of Google+
whose size increased dramatically; Phase II from day 21 to day 75,
during which Google+ went into a stabilized increase phase; and
Phase III from day 76 to day 98, when Google+ opened to public
(i.e., without requiring an invitation), resulting in a dramatic growth
again. We point this out because we observe a similar three-phase
evolution pattern for almost all network metrics that we analyze in
the subsequent sections.
In the following sections, we use the last or largest snapshot,
unless we are interested in the time-varying behavior.
Potential biases: We would like to acknowledge two possible bi-
ases. First, users may keep some of their friends or circles private.
In this case, we can only see the publicly visible list. Thus we
may not crawl the entire WCC and underestimate the node degrees.
However, as discussed earlier, we obtain a very large connected
component that covers more than 70% of known users which is
sufﬁciently representative. Second, users may choose not to de-
clare their attributes, in which case we may underestimate the im-
pact of attributes on the social structure. However, we ﬁnd that
roughly 22% of users declare at least one attribute which repre-
sents a statistically large sample from which to draw conclusions.
Furthermore, by validating the attribute-related results via further
subsampling the attributes we have, we show that our attributes are
representative of the entire attributes.
3. SOCIAL STRUCTURE OF THE
GOOGLE+ SAN
In this section, we begin by presenting several canonical network
metrics commonly used for characterizing social networks such as
the reciprocity, density, clustering coefﬁcient, and degree distribu-
tion [38, 25, 28, 41]. These metrics are useful to expose the inher-
ent structure of a social network in terms of the friend relationships
and whether there are “community” structures beyond a one-hop
In directed social networks, the distance between two user nodes
u and v, dist(u, v) is deﬁned as the length of the shortest directed
path whose head is v and tail is u. Note that only social links Es are
used in this deﬁnition. We ﬁnd that the distribution of the distance
between nodes has a dominant mode at a distance of six, with most
nodes (90%) having a distance of 5, 6, or 7 (not shown).
1In graph theory, density is deﬁned as the fraction of existing links
with respect to all possible links. We follow the terminology in [26]
in order to compare with previous results.

Figure 4: Evolution of four key metrics: reciprocity, density, diameter and clustering coefﬁcient on the Google+ SAN. In each case, we
observe distinct behaviors in the three phases corresponding to early initialization, time to public release, and time after public release.
(b) Social density
(c) Diameter
Based on the distance distribution, we can also deﬁne the effec-
tive diameter as the 90-th percentile distance (possibly with some
interpolation) between every pair of connected nodes [33]. Unfor-
tunately, computing the effective diameter is infeasible for large
networks, so we use the HyperANF approximation algorithm [8],
which has been shown to be able to approximate diameter with high
accuracy.
Previous work observed effective diameter shrinks in citation
networks, autonomous networks and afﬁliation network [33], in
Flickr and Yahoo! 360 [26], and in Cyworld [3]. However, we ob-
serve that the effective diameter follows a three-phase evolution as
seen in Figure 4c, which again can be explained in conjunction with
the trends in Figures 2a and 3a. In Phase I, user joining rate out-
paces link creation rate, causing the diameter to increase; in Phase
II, user joining rate is lower than link acquisition rate, resulting
in decreasing diameter; and in Phase III user joining rate is much
higher, resulting in a diameter increasing phase again. Again, our
observations have implications for network modeling. Existing net-
work models either assume logarithmically growing diameter [55,
5] or shrinking diameter [30, 33].
3.4 Clustering Coefﬁcient
Given a network G and node u, u’s clustering coefﬁcient is de-
ﬁned as
c(u) =
L(u)
|Γs(u)|(|Γs(u)| − 1)
,
(cid:80)
where L(u) is the number of links among u’s social neighbors
Γs(u) and the average social clustering coefﬁcient is deﬁned as
c(u) [55]. Intuitively, this captures the commu-
Cs = 1|Vs|
nity structure among a user’s friends.
u∈Vs
Again, computing the average clustering coefﬁcient is expensive.
Thus, we extend the constant-time approximate algorithm proposed
by Schank et al. for undirected networks [45], and develop an al-
gorithm to approximate the clustering coefﬁcients for a directed
22 (cid:101) random samples, our constant time algo-
network. With (cid:100) ln2ν
rithms can bound the error of average clustering coefﬁcient within
 with probability at least 1 − 1
ν . In practice, we set the error to be
 = 0.002 and ν = 100. Algorithm details and theoretical analysis
can be found in Appendix A.
Kossinets et al. [25] observed constant average social clustering
coefﬁcient over time in an email communication network. How-
ever, we ﬁnd that the evolution of average social clustering coef-
ﬁcient of Google+, which is shown in Figure 4d, again follows a
three-phase evolution pattern where the clustering coefﬁcient dra-
matically decreases in Phase I, increases slowly in Phase II and de-
creases again in Phase III. Our ﬁndings indicate that the community
structure among users’ friends is highly dynamic, which inspires us
to do dynamic community detection.

(b) Indegree

that both are best modeled by a discrete lognormal distribution un-
like many networks that suggest power-law distributions.

and outdegree distributions.
3.5 Degree Distributions
Next, we focus on the social indegree and outdegree of users in
Google+. In each case, we are also interested in identifying an em-
pirical best-ﬁt distribution using the tool [54, 10], which compares
ﬁts of several widely used distributions (e.g., power-law, lognor-
mal, power-law with cutoff using) with respect to goodness-of-ﬁt.
We ﬁnd that unlike many studies on social networks, in which so-
cial degrees usually follow a power-law distribution [13, 38], so-
cial degrees are best captured by a discrete lognormal distribution
in Google+. Recall that a random variable x ∈ Z+ follows a
power-law distribution if p(x = k) ∝ k−α, where α is the ex-
ponent of the power-law distribution. On the other hand, a ran-
dom variable x ∈ Z+ follows a discrete lognormal distribution if
p(x = k) ∝ 1
) [7], where µ and σ are the mean
and standard deviation respectively of the lognormal distribution.
Figure 5 shows these degree distributions and their discrete log-
normal ﬁts, and Figure 6 shows the evolutions of the parameters for
the ﬁtted discrete lognormal distributions. We see the evolution of

with the ﬂuctuation differing in magnitude (Figures 6a, 6b).
Lognormally distributed degree distributions imply that there are
probabilistically more low degree social nodes in Google+ than
those in power-law distributed networks.

(b) Assortativity

(a) knn shows a log-log plot of the outdegree versus the average
indegree of friends and (b) shows the evolution of the assortativity
coefﬁcient.
3.6 Joint Degree Distribution
Last, we examine the joint degree distribution (JDD) of the Google+
social structure. JDD is useful for understanding the preference of
a node to attach itself to nodes that are similar to itself. One way to
approximate the JDD is using the degree correlation function knn,
which maps outdegree to the average indegree of all nodes con-
nected to nodes of that outdegree [42, 38]. An increasing knn trend
indicates high-degree nodes tend to connect to other high-degree
nodes; a decreasing knn represents the opposite trend. Figure 7a
shows the knn function for Google+ social structure.
The JDD can further be quantiﬁed using the assortativity coef-
ﬁcient r that can range from -1 to 1 [41]. r is positive if knn is
positively correlated to node degree k. Figure 7b illustrates the evo-
lution of the assortativity coefﬁcient. We observe that r keeps de-
creasing in all three phases but at different rates. Furthermore, un-
like many traditional social networks where the assortativity coefﬁ-
cient is typically positive—0.202 for Flickr, 0.179 for LiveJournal
and 0.072 for Orkut [38, 41]—Google+ has almost neutral assorta-
tivity close to 0. The neutral assortativity can possibly be explained
by the hypothesis that Google+ is a hybrid of two ingredients, i.e., a
traditional social network and a publisher-subscriber network (e.g.,
Twitter). Traditional social networks usually have positive assor-
tativity; publisher-subscriber networks often have negative assorta-
tivity because high-degree publisher nodes tend to be connected to
low-degree subscriber nodes. Thus a hybrid of them results in a net-
work with neutral assortativity. The evolution pattern of Google+’
assortativity coefﬁcient (i.e., positive in Phase I, around 0 in Phase
II, and negative in Phase III) manifests the competing process of
the two ingredients of Google+. More speciﬁcally, the traditional
network ingredient slightly wins in Phase I, resulting in a slightly
positive assortativity coefﬁcient. A draw between them in Phase
II results in the neutral assortativity. In Phase III, the publisher-
subscriber ingredient wins, resulting in a slightly negative assorta-
tivity coefﬁcient. This implies that Google+ is more and more like
a publisher-subscriber network.
3.7 Summary of Key Observations and Impli-
cations
Analyzing the social structure of Google+ and its evolution over
time, we ﬁnd that:
• In contrast to many traditional networks, we ﬁnd that Google+
has low reciprocity, the social degree distribution is best mod-
eled by a lognormal distribution rather than a power-law distri-
bution, and the assortativity is neutral rather than positive.
• Google+ is somewhere between a traditional social network
(e.g., Flickr) and a publisher-subscriber network (e.g., Twitter),
reﬂecting the hybrid interaction model that it offers. Moreover,
it’s more and more closer to a publisher-subscriber network.
• The evolutionary patterns of various network metrics in Google+
are different from those in many traditional networks or as-
sumptions of various network models. These ﬁndings imply
that existing models cannot explain the underlying growing mech-
anism of Google+, and we need to design new models for re-
producing social networks similar to Google+.
4. ATTRIBUTE STRUCTURE OF THE
GOOGLE+ SAN
In the previous section we looked at well-known social network
metrics. In this section, we focus on analyzing the attribute struc-
ture of the Google+ SAN. To this end, we extend the metrics from
the previous section to the attributes as well. Finally, we show the
importance of using attributes in understanding the social struc-
ture by studying their impact on metrics we analyzed earlier (e.g.,
reciprocity, clustering coefﬁcient, and degree distribution). These
attribute-related studies will characterize the attribute structure, give
us insights about the underlying growing mechanism of Google+,
and eventually guide us design a new generative model for Google+
SAN.

Density: We consider a natural extension of the social density
metric from §3.2 and deﬁne attribute density as |Ea|
|Va| . Different
from our observations with social density in Figure 4b, in Figure 8a,
We observe the attribute density increases rapidly in Phase I, stays
relatively ﬂat in Phase II, and slightly decreases in Phase III. The
reason for the decrease in Phase III is the large volume of new
(i.e., non-invitation) users joining Google+ with many new attribute
nodes whose social degrees are small.
Diameter: We extend the distance metric from §3.3 to deﬁne the
attribute distance between two attribute nodes a and b as dist(a, b) =
min{dist(u, v)|u ∈ Γs(a), v ∈ Γs(b)} + 1.2 Intuitively, attribute
distance is the minimum number of social nodes that a attribute
node has to traverse before reaching to the other one; i.e., attribute
distance is the distance between two attribute communities. Sim-
ilarly, we can consider the effective diameter using this attribute
distance. Figure 4c also shows the evolution of the attribute diam-
eter and shows that it very closely mirrors the social diameter.
Clustering coefﬁcient: Similarly, we generalize the social clus-
