the desired content. The maximum number of subscriptions
per user is roughly 400.
A priori, it is not clear how a typical user would main-
tain his set of podcast subscriptions. Users may maintain
a stable set of podcasts that they have subscribed and lis-
ten to over a long period of time; similarly, users may show
a more dynamic behavior updating their subscription set
regularly. Fig. 15 shows the distribution of the mean and
median inter-subscription time per user. Fig. 15 indicates
that subscriptions are batched over time with the median
being signiﬁcantly larger than the mean. While more than
half of the subscription events are spaced at the timescale of
days, the median value per user is in the order of minutes.
We further examined the rate at which users update their
subscriptions either by adding a new or removing an existing
podcast from their subscription sets. The mean and median
values per user are essentially similar to the distributions of
Fig. 15.
The rate of adding new subscriptions is typically higher
than removing the existing subscriptions. Fig. 16 presents
this blow-up of subscriptions by presenting the diﬀerence
of subscriptions and unsubscriptions per user, versus the
number of total subscriptions on the x-axis. This suggests
that, in scenarios of device-to-device dissemination, system

designers may need to deploy automated mechanisms for
prioritizing the content synchronization, rather than solely
relying on the information about podcast subscriptions.
Information Gateways. What portion of users bring
new content (i.e., podcasts) to the service? Such users es-
sentially subscribe to podcasts for which no subscriptions
exist before in our trace and may be regarded as informa-
tion gateways; they are valuable in furnishing the service
with references to new and potentially interesting content.
Surprisingly, we ﬁnd that only 1% of all distinct users in-
troduced at least one podcast. Conditioning on these users,
the portion of users who introduced n podcasts decreases
roughly exponentially with n ranging from 1 to 5 podcasts.
The decrease is signiﬁcant with an order of magnitude de-
crease from n to n + 1. These observations suggest that only
a small portion of users introduce new podcasts and the ma-
jority of users exhibit a “follower” behavior by subscribing to
existing podcasts in the service. Note that this is consistent
with earlier ﬁndings in various online services and peer-to-
peer systems, where, typically, only a small portion of users
make most of the contributions (see, e.g. [6]).
4.2 Play Events
We now consider how typical users consume content, by
examining play events. The distribution of the mean and
median inter-play time of episodes per user is shown in
Fig. 17. For half of the users, the median and mean inter-
play times are less than 2 hours and 1.5 days respectively.
The median value is signiﬁcantly smaller than the mean
value indicating existence of play sessions. This is rather
natural as users appear to listen to a batch of episodes

median is around three podcast subscriptions per
user.

scriptions and unsubscriptions per user. The line
presents the mean across the y-axis. The subscrip-
tion set per user appears to increase over time (i.e.,
the number of new subscriptions is larger than the
one of unsubscriptions).

ference of the mean and median values suggests

in succession over time with small inter-play times, and
such batches of episodes are separated with longer inter-play
times.
Play events and devices. Play events may occur both
at the Zune device and also at a personal computer. As
such, one would expect that most users would play podcasts
from either of the two types of devices (e.g., using the Zune
device while away from home or oﬃce and personal com-
puter otherwise). On the contrary, we ﬁnd that most users
play podcasts exclusively on one type of device. Concretely,
we found that 36.55% of the users play podcasts exclusively
from personal computers, 60.63% exclusively from Zune de-
vices, and only a miniscule 2.82% of users play podcasts
from both. In retrospect, this ﬁnding may appear natural
as users may establish particular habits and stick to speciﬁc
routines when interacting with the service. However, it is
somewhat surprising that only a very tiny portion of users
listen to podcasts using both device types.
Usage of particular devices, however, appears to correlate
with time of day. Fig. 18 shows the cumulative fraction of
plays across the time of day from either Zune devices or

The diﬀerence between the CDFs suggests the exis-
tence of play sessions.
personal computers. While the respective rates follow each
other over time, there is some noticeably larger rate of the
use of Zune devices during working hours. Combining the
previous observation, this ﬁnding may reﬂect a particular
proﬁle of users that listen to podcasts during working hours
when away from their personal computers.
Subscriptions vs. play events. While subscriptions
could be interpreted as explicit expressions of interest, they
do not necessarily imply consumption of content. It is thus
of interest to understand how this expression of interest cor-
relates with actual consumption of the content, i.e. playing
of episodes of the subscribed podcasts. This is informative
to assess eﬀective demands on the content synchronization
and dissemination.
Fig. 19 shows the distribution of distinct podcasts played
over time intervals of varied lengths that cover a range of
timescales from minutes to weeks. Surprisingly, we observe
that more than half of the users play no podcasts over time
intervals of length up to a week. This is consistent with our
earlier observation that the mean inter-play time of podcasts

devices appear more frequently used during working
hours.
Figure 20: Number of distinct feeds played over a
time interval vs. the interval length (90th quantile).
Distinct curves correspond to diﬀerent observation
instants. Typical users play less than 3-4 distinct
podcasts.

is 1.5 days over all users (see Fig. 17). In general, all but 10%
of users play less than 4 distinct podcasts over time intervals
of length of a week or less (less than 10 podcasts for all but
1% of users). These observations suggest that a typical user
listens to a few distinct podcasts over time intervals shorther
than a week. In order to better understand the dependence
on the length of the observation interval, we consider the 0.9-
quantile of the number of distinct podcasts played over users
for a range of lengths of the observation interval (Fig. 20).
We ﬁnd that over day-long intervals, a typical user plays less
than 3 to 4 distinct podcasts and this number is less than
6 over week-long intervals. Hence, while some users may
be subscribed to a large number of podcasts, they typically
listen to a few over a timescale of days. This observation
could be exploited for the design of prioritization schemes for
content synchronization and dissemination, where podcasts
with high consumption probability would be synchronized
ﬁrst. With respect to weekly patterns, we observe that most
play times occur during weekdays (Fig. 21), conforming with
our observation that working hours observe larger play rates.
Figure 21: Percentage of plays vs. day of week.
Most plays are during weekdays.
4.3 Popularity of Podcasts
The analysis of the popularity of podcasts is signiﬁcant
when considering peer-to-peer assisted or device-to-device
dissemination of the podcasts. Fig. 22 displays the CCDF
of the percentage of subscriptions per podcast. The distri-
bution best ﬁts to a log-normal distribution. Roughly 1%
of podcasts have more than a few percentages of the total
users. The CCDF of popularity with respect to the number
of plays shows similar trends (Fig. 23).
To examine how podcast popularity compares across sub-
scription and play events, Fig. 24 provides a ﬁrst comparison
of the podcasts’ rankings based on user subscriptions versus
the number of plays per podcasts. 80% of play events are
generated by the 20% most subscribed podcasts, and as ex-
pected, the two rankings seem positively correlated.
To further illustrate the diﬀerence between the two rank-
ings, Fig. 25 plots the fraction of the k most subscribed
podcasts that exist also in the k most played podcast set, as
k varies.2 It is quite surprising to notice that only roughly

tion rank. Only around 20% of the most subscribed
podcasts are within the 100 most played ones.
20% of the most subscribed podcasts are within the 100 most
played podcasts. This might be an eﬀect of the interface on
the Zune Social site, where users are suggested a list of the
most popular and most recent podcasts. Such podcasts then
would receive subscriptions with higher probability, even if
they are not the true most popular podcasts (if true popu-
larity is based on the number of plays). Interestingly, we see
no plays for 30% of podcasts throughout our dataset. Ta-
ble 4 further highlights this diﬀerence of popularity in terms
of subscribed versus played podcasts by displaying the set
of the top-3 most popular podcasts in each case.
4.4 Popularity Reinforcement
User subscriptions to podcasts may be inﬂuenced by a
number of factors. These factors may range from intrinsic
interest for the content of the podcast to simply following
other users by subscribing to popular podcasts. Lists of
“what’s hot” or “what’s popular” are common in feed aggre-
gator sites, and similar lists exist in Zune Social that typi-
cally displays a handful of the most popular podcasts (e.g.,
top-5). Additionally, users may browse podcasts through of-
in information-retrieval, known as weighted recall at k and
precision at k.
fered categorizations, thus conditioning podcasts under spe-
ciﬁc topics. Here, we attempt to provide some hints as to
how the matching of users to podcasts occurs, by examining
factors that could inﬂuence user choices. Our results sug-
gest the existence of the reinforcement of podcast popularity,
where “rich-get-richer” types of relationships prevail.
We ﬁrst consider the subscription rate to a podcast given
the number of subscriptions that the podcast has already
received. Fig. 26 shows the average waiting time until the
next subscription to a podcast that has already received n
subscriptions. Except for small values of n (i.e., a few tens
of subscriptions), the average waiting time seems to scale as
1/n. Such a law could arise in the following hypothetical sce-
narios. For example, assume that the n users who subscribed
to a given podcast are independent and have disconnected
sets of friends to whom they can advertise the podcast; in
such a case, we get the scaling in 1/n (if friends subscribe at
a ﬁxed rate). In another example, suppose that users tend
to subscribe to a podcast with the probability proportional
the the current number of subscribers of the podcast, each
after some independent random delay. In both these cases,
the average waiting time until a new subscriber is inversely
proportional to the current number of subscribers. Simi-
lar observations hold when we consider the rate of playing

a podcast conditional on the number of times this podcast
was already played (Fig. 27). As in the case of subscriptions,
we observe that the same law holds.
We further estimate the probability that a user subscribes
to a podcast with n subscriptions (Fig. 28). We ﬁnd that
this probability of selection is proportional to the number
of subscribers n over a wide range of values from a few to
thousands of subscriptions.
These observations suggest that the user choice in sub-
scribing to and playing of podcasts is aﬀected by their pop-
ularity. This may well be the result of exposing the popular
podcasts more prominently in the user interface or a result
of user-to-user recommendations. Overall, the probability of
subscribing to a podcast increases linearly with the number
of subscribers, which is consistent with standard preferential
attachment models (see e.g. [7]).
5. PODCAST DISSEMINATION
In this section, we investigate various ways of disseminat-
ing podcast episodes to the users. Speciﬁcally, we consider
three ways of downloading episodes from the Internet to user
devices. The ﬁrst natural way for users to download episodes
is when the device is connected to the Internet, either at
home through broadband connectivity, or via WLAN access
points. The second way is to use the traditional 3G cellular
networks. Finally, podcast episodes could be disseminated
in an ad-hoc manner using device-to-device peer-to-peer as-
sisted communication, i.e., users having podcast episodes in
