User: I have some bash scripts, some simple ones to copy, search, write lines to files and so on.
I am an Ubuntu. and I've searched in google, but it seems that everybody is doing that on python.
I could do these on python, but since I am not a python programmer, I just know the basics.
I have no idea of how calling a sh script from a GUI written on python.
If someone has a link or something to say, please drop a line.
regards, 
Mario
Assistant: basically, all bash does is start other programs (and do symbolic math on the command line). So no, you're going to have to involve some other program.
