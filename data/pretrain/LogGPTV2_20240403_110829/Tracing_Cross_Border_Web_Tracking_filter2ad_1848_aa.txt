## Abstract
A tracking flow is defined as a data exchange between an end user and a web tracking service. We have developed a comprehensive measurement methodology to quantify the scale of tracking flows that cross data protection borders, whether national or international, such as the EU28 border where the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) applies. Our methodology leverages a browser extension for rendering advertising and tracking code, various lists and heuristics to identify known trackers, passive DNS replication to map all IP ranges of trackers, and state-of-the-art geolocation techniques. We applied our methodology to a dataset from 350 real users over more than four months and then generalized our results by analyzing billions of web tracking flows from over 60 million broadband and mobile users across four large European ISPs. Our findings indicate that while the majority of tracking flows in Europe cross national borders, they are largely confined within the broader GDPR jurisdiction. Simple DNS redirection and Point of Presence (PoP) mirroring can enhance national confinement and ensure almost all tracking flows remain within Europe. Additionally, we found that cross-border tracking is prevalent even in sensitive and protected data categories, including health, sexual orientation, and minors.

## 1. Introduction
Online advertising, including behavioral targeting via the Real-Time Bidding (RTB) protocol, fuels most free web services. While targeted advertising aims to offer products and services that users care about, its implementation raises significant privacy concerns. Tracking should respect fundamental data protection rights, such as opt-out options, and avoid sensitive personal data like health, political beliefs, religion, or sexual orientation. The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) provides robust protections for these rights, with steep fines for violations. Effective monitoring and enforcement of GDPR require sound factual data, making the development of new methodologies and data collection crucial.

A growing body of literature addresses various aspects of web tracking, but geographical aspects have received less attention. Key questions include: Where are the back-end servers of trackers? How far do tracking flows travel? Which borders do they cross? And how can tracking be contained within a specific data protection jurisdiction?

## 2. Background
### 2.1 Why Location Matters
Location is critical for data protection, even though GDPR applies regardless of the location of the tracker's legal or technical base. Knowing whether a tracking flow crosses EU28 borders is essential for investigation and enforcement, as it facilitates legal access to the tracking backend. National borders are also important due to jurisdictional reasons, as each EU country has its own Data Protection Authority (DPA) responsible for handling complaints. Additionally, other national laws may impact tracking, making it important to know if tracking flows stay within national borders.

### 2.2 Online Tracking Over RTB
Figure 1 illustrates the entities involved in targeted advertising via RTB. These entities, which may include ad and tracking code, induce tracking flows when a consumer visits a publisher's website. We focus on directly visible tracking flows, i.e., those involving the execution of tracking code in the consumer's browser.

### 2.3 Challenges
- **Challenge 1: Collecting Real Tracking Flows**  
  Existing work has focused on identifying trackers in publisher websites, but this is challenging because it requires full rendering of webpages. Capturing the full spatial aspects of tracking flows requires real users with diverse browsing histories and locations.
- **Challenge 2: Completeness of Measurement**  
  Combining the precision of full rendering with the scale of passively collected network logs poses challenges in ensuring completeness, such as identifying all tracking domains and their associated IPs.
- **Challenge 3: Precision of Analysis**  
  Accurate IP geolocation is crucial for reliable results. Infrastructure IPs are prone to imprecise geolocation, and it is important to verify if tracking IPs are dedicated to tracking or shared with other services.

## 3. Methodology
### 3.1 Our Browser Extension
To identify tracking flows, we developed a browser extension for Google Chrome. This extension monitors all outgoing third-party requests and maps the associated server IP. We recruited 350 users from the CrowdFlower platform, excluding those with ad-blocking extensions. Over four months, these users visited more than 76,000 unique websites, generating over 7.1 million third-party requests.

### 3.2 Improving Completeness and Precision
- **Completeness**  
  We use passive DNS replication to identify all IP ranges of trackers, ensuring a comprehensive lookup.
- **Precision**  
  We employ state-of-the-art geolocation techniques to improve the accuracy of our measurements.

## 4. Results
By applying our methodology to data from 350 CrowdFlower users and NetFlow data from 60 million ISP subscribers, we found:
- Most tracking flows (around 90%) originating from EU28 users terminate at tracking servers within EU28, contrasting with popular belief.
- Confinement within national borders is much lower, peaking at less than 70% and becoming single-digit for small countries.
- DNS redirection and PoP mirroring can improve the confinement of tracking flows, both at the country and continent levels.
- Despite GDPR, around 3% of total tracking flows relate to protected data categories, and the percentage crossing borders is similar to general tracking traffic.

## 5. Conclusion
Our study provides a detailed methodology for mapping the geographic characteristics of tracking flows at scale. The findings highlight the importance of geographical considerations in web tracking and the potential for improving data protection through simple technical measures.
