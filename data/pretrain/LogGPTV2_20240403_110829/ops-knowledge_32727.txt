User: How to use Git to manage code, and explain the basic operations of Git, such as add, commit, and push.
Assistant: To use Git to manage code, you need to install Git software first, create a local warehouse, add code files in the local warehouse and add them to the Git cache, and finally submit the code in the cache to the local warehouse or push to the remote in the warehouse. The following are the basic operations of Git: 1. Initialize the warehouse: Enter the specified directory and use the git init command to initialize a new Git warehouse. 2. Add files: Use the git add command to add files to the Git cache, for example: git add file1.py. 3. Submit changes: Use the git commit command to submit the code in the cache area to the local warehouse, for example: git commit -m "commit message". 4. View warehouse status: Use the git status command to view the status of the warehouse, for example: git status. 5. View the commit history: Use the git log command to view the commit history of the warehouse, for example: git log. 6. Create a branch: Use the git branch command to create a new branch, for example: git branch new_branch. 7. Switch branch: Use the git checkout command to switch the current working branch, for example: git checkout new_branch. 8. Merge branches: Use the git merge command to merge a branch into the current branch, for example: git merge new_branch. 9. Push code: Use the git push command to push the code in the local warehouse to the remote warehouse, for example: git pull origin master. In short, Git is a very powerful version management tool, suitable for team development, and can help developers effectively manage and collaborate on code, and improve code quality and efficiency.
