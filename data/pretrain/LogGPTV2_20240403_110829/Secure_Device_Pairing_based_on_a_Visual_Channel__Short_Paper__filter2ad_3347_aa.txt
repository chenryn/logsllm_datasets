Abstract
Recently several researchers and practitioners have be-
gun to address the problem of how to set up secure com-
munication between two devices without the assistance of
a trusted third party. McCune, et al. [4] proposed that one
device displays the hash of its public key in the form of a
barcode, and the other device reads it using a camera. Mu-
tual authentication requires switching the roles of the de-
vices and repeating the above process in the reverse direc-
tion.
In this paper, we show how strong mutual authentication
can be achieved even with a unidirectional visual channel,
without having to switch device roles. By adopting recently
proposed improved pairing protocols, we propose how vi-
sual channel authentication can be used even on devices
that have very limited displaying capabilities.
1. Introduction
The popularity of short-range wireless technologies like
Bluetooth and Wireless Local Area Networking is experi-
encing enormous growth. Newer technologies like Wireless
Universal Serial Bus1 are around the corner and promise to
be as popular. This rise in popularity implies that an ever in-
creasing proportion of the users of devices supporting short-
range wireless communication are not technically savvy.
Such users need very simple and intuitive methods for set-
ting up their devices. Since wireless communication is eas-
ier to eavesdrop on and to manipulate, a common set up task
is to initialize secure communication. In this paper, we will
use the term pairing to refer to this operation.2

2The term pairing was introduced in the context of Bluetooth devices.
Other roughly synonymous terms include “bonding”, and “imprinting”.
The pairing problem is to enable two devices, which
share no prior context with each other, to agree upon a se-
curity association that they can use to protect their subse-
quent communication. Secure pairing must be resistant to a
man-in-the-middle adversary who tries to impersonate one
or both of these devices. The adversary is assumed to be ca-
pable of listening to or modifying messages on the com-
munication channel between the devices. One approach to
secure pairing is to use an additional physically authenti-
catable “out-of-band” (OOB) channel. The adversary is as-
sumed to be incapable of modifying messages on the OOB
channel.
There has been a signiﬁcant amount of prior work on
building secure pairing protocols using OOB channels [6,
1]. They consider different types of OOB channels in-
cluding physical connections, infrared, etc. Recently, Mc-
Cune, et al. proposed a scheme called “Seeing-is-Believing”
(SiB), where the OOB channel is implemented as a vi-
sual channel. The SiB visual channel consists of a two-
dimensional barcode displayed by (or afﬁxed to) a device
A, that represents security-relevant information unique to
A. A user can point another camera-equipped device B at
the barcode so that B can read the barcode visually, and use
this information to set up an authenticated channel to A. If
both devices are camera-equipped, they can mutually au-
thenticate each other. “Authentication” in this case is based
on demonstrative identiﬁcation [1] rather than with respect
to a claimed name.
In this paper, we propose several extensions to SiB. We
start with a brief description of SiB in Section 2. In Sec-
tion 3, we describe an alternative protocol that enables mu-
tual authentication even when only one device has a cam-
era. In Section 4, we show how visual channel authentica-
tion can be done even in highly constrained environments.
We discuss the applicability and relevance of our extensions
in Section 5.

2. Seeing-is-Believing (SiB)
In SiB [4], a device A can authenticate to a device B, if
B is equipped with a camera. The hash of A’s public key is
encoded in the form of a two-dimensional barcode. A typi-
cal barcode has dimensions approximately 2.5x2.5 cm2. If
A has a display, its public key can be ephemeral, and the
barcode is shown on the display. Otherwise, A’s public key
needs to be permanent and the barcode is printed on a label
and afﬁxed to A. Authentication is done by the user point-
ing B’s camera at A’s barcode. The basic unidirectional au-
thentication process is depicted in Figure 1.
1. A calculates hA as h(KA)
A −→ B (visual channel): hA
2. A −→ B (insecure channel): KA
B calculates h(cid:3)
as h(KA) using the KA received. If
does not match the hA received in Step 1, B aborts.
h(cid:3)
Figure 1. SiB unidirectional authentication
protocol (B authenticates A)
KA is A’s public key. h() is a cryptographic hash func-
tion, which is resistant to second pre-image ﬁnding. KA can
be long-lived, in which case the output of h() must be suf-
ﬁciently large, e.g., at least 80-bits. If KA is ephemeral, the
output of h() can be smaller, at least 48 bits [2]. SiB could
accommodate 68 bits of hash into a single two-dimensional
barcode, but requires a good quality display due to the typ-
ical size of the barcode3. Mutual authentication requires
the protocol of Figure 1 being run in each direction. This
has two implications for SiB. First, mutual authentication
is possible only if both devices are equipped with cameras.
A camera-less device can only achieve a property known as
“presence” [4]. Presence is weaker than authentication be-
cause A has no means of knowing if B is really the device
that the user of A intended to communicate with. We sum-
marize the types of authentication achievable using SiB for
given combinations of device types in Table 1. Second, in
order to run the protocol in each direction, the roles of the
devices have to be switched so that ﬁrst A’s camera can
scan B’s display and then B’s camera can scan A’s display.
This increases the overall execution time. The average exe-
cution time in SiB was 8 seconds [4], even though time re-
quired to recognize a barcode is just about one second.
These implications limit the applicability of SiB in var-
ious practical settings. Many devices cannot have either
cameras or high quality displays for different reasons. Com-
moditized devices like wireless access points are extremely

cost-sensitive and the likelihood of adding new hardware
for the purpose of authentication is very small. Devices like
Bluetooth headsets are typically too small to have displays
or even to afﬁx static barcode stickers.
To summarize, SiB has the following drawbacks:
1. Mutual authentication is not possible unless both de-
vices are equipped with cameras.
2. The need to switch device roles increases overall exe-
cution time.
3. Applicability of SiB is limited in situations where one
device has limited capabilities (e.g., small size and lim-
ited display).
3. Seeing Better: Upgrading Presence to Au-
thentication
We observe that the ﬁrst two drawbacks stem from the
fact that mutual authentication is done as two separate uni-
directional authentication steps. Therefore, we propose to
solve both problems by performing mutual authentication
in a single step by having each of A and B compute a com-
mon checksum on public data, and compare their results via
a unidirectional transfer using the visual channel. Let us call
this protocol VIC, for “Visual authentication based on In-
tegrity Checking.” (See Figure 2.)
The security of the authentication of A to B in VIC de-
pends on the attacker not being able to ﬁnd two numbers X1
and X2 such that h(KA, X1) = h(X2, KB). This implies
that if the attacker can learn KB ahead of time, h() needs to
be collision-resistant. If KB is ephemeral (or a nonce picked
by B is appended to KB in message 2 and in the calculation
of hA and hB), it is sufﬁcient for h() to be resistant to sec-
ond pre-image ﬁnding, since the attacker can no longer use
any pre-computed collisions. The security of the authenti-

cation of B to A depends, in addition, on the user correctly
reporting the comparison result reported by B back to A.
Because VIC needs only a unidirectional visual chan-
nel, it is now possible to achieve mutual authentication in
the cases where SiB could only achieve presence. In addi-
tion, the execution time for mutual authentication is shorter
since no device role switching is required anymore. Thus,
VIC addresses the ﬁrst two drawbacks of SiB identiﬁed in
Section 2.
In Table 2, we summarize the types of authentication
achievable using VIC for given combinations of device
types. Notice that since the checksum is different for each
instance of VIC, at least one device must have a display and
that the static barcode labels cannot be used with VIC.

4. Seeing With Less: Visual Channel in Con-
strained Devices
Now we show how to enable visual channel authentica-
tion on devices with very limited displays. This is made pos-
sible by using key agreement protocols that require short
authenticated integrity checksums. We begin by describing
such protocols.
4.1. Authentication Using Short Integrity
Checksums
The reason why SiB needs good displays is the high vi-
sual channel bandwidth required for the SiB protocol. As-
suming that the attackers have access to today’s state-of-the-
art computing resources, the bandwidth needed is at least
48 bits in the case of ephemeral keys [2], rising to 80 bits
in the case of long-lived keys. These numbers can only in-
crease over time.
Fortunately, there is a family of authentication protocols
that has very low bandwidth requirements. The ﬁrst proto-
col in this family was proposed by Gehrmann et al. in [2].
Several subsequent variations on the same theme have been
reported [7, 3]. We apply the variation called “MA-3” [3] to
get VICsh (VIC with short checksum), as depicted in Fig-
ure 3.
1. A chooses a long random bit string RA and calculates
hA as h(RA).
A −→ B (insecure channel): hA, KA
A ←− B (insecure channel): RB, KB
2. B chooses its own long random bit string RB
3. A −→ B (insecure channel): RA
B now computes h(cid:3)
A as h(RA) and compares it
with the hA received in message 1. If they do not
match, B aborts. Otherwise B continues.
4. A calculates hsA as hs(RA, RB, KA, KB) and B cal-
culates hsB as hs(RA, RB, KA, KB)
A −→ B (visual channel): hsA
B compares hsA and hsB. If they match, B ac-
cepts and continues. Otherwise B rejects and aborts. In
either case, B indicates accept/reject to the user.
5. A prompts user as to whether B accepted or rejected.
A continues if the user answers afﬁrmatively. Other-
wise A rejects.
Figure 3. VICsh mutual authentication proto-
col based on short integrity checksum
KA, KB are as in the case of SiB. h() represents a com-
mitment scheme and hs() is a mixing function with a short
n-bit output (e.g., n = 15 . . . 20) such that a change in any
input bit will, with high probability, result in a change in the
output. Refer to [3] for formal description of the require-
ments on h() and hs(), and their instantiations, as well as
for the proofs of security of the protocol.
4.2. Trimming Down the Display
Now, we describe visual channel authentication using the
VICsh protocol on a display-less device containing a single
