# Network Integrations
:::image type="icon" source="../media/icon-networks-medium.png":::

Traditional enterprise networks are designed to provide users with access to applications and data hosted in company-operated data centers, protected by strong perimeter security. However, the modern workplace increasingly relies on services and data outside the corporate firewall. Applications and services have moved to the cloud, and users need to access them from a variety of work and personal devices.

Network solutions play a crucial role in Zero Trust architectures. They verify that ingress and egress traffic at the network edge is permissible and inspect traffic for malicious content. These solutions support the principle of least privilege and the "assume breach" mindset by enabling organizations to segment networks and grant users access only to the necessary segments.

## Zero Trust Integration with Network Solutions

Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) integrate their security expertise with Microsoft's network solutions to enhance the overall security posture. This article highlights our network integration partners, allowing customers to leverage familiar, best-in-breed, third-party Security as a Service (SECaaS) offerings to protect internet access for their users. For more information on becoming an ISV partner, see the [Microsoft 365 Networking Partner Program](/microsoft-365/enterprise/microsoft-365-networking-partner-program).

### Gateway Load Balancer

Gateway Load Balancer is a specialized SKU within the Azure Load Balancer portfolio, designed for high-performance and high-availability scenarios with third-party Network Virtual Appliances (NVAs). It simplifies the deployment, scaling, and management of NVAs.

### Virtual WAN

Virtual WAN is a comprehensive networking service that consolidates various networking, security, and routing functionalities into a single operational interface. It supports a hub-and-spoke architecture, providing scalable and performant connectivity for branches (VPN/SD-WAN devices), users (Azure VPN/OpenVPN/IKEv2 clients), ExpressRoute circuits, and virtual networks. This service enables a global transit network architecture, where the cloud-hosted network 'hub' facilitates transitive connectivity between endpoints distributed across different types of 'spokes'.

### Azure Web Application Firewall

Azure Web Application Firewall (WAF) offers centralized protection against common exploits and vulnerabilities for your web applications. WAF can be deployed with Azure Application Gateway, Azure Front Door, and Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) services. The WAF on Azure CDN is currently in public preview.

### DDoS Protection

Azure DDoS Protection, combined with best practices in application design, provides enhanced DDoS mitigation features to defend against DDoS attacks. It automatically tunes to protect specific Azure resources in a virtual network. Enabling DDoS protection is straightforward for any new or existing virtual network and does not require changes to applications or resources.

### Azure Firewall Manager

[Azure Firewall Manager](/azure/firewall-manager/overview) is a security management service that provides centralized security policy and route management for cloud-based security perimeters. Security partner providers have integrated with Azure Firewall Manager, allowing customers to use familiar, best-in-breed, third-party SECaaS offerings to protect internet access for their users. Customers can secure a hub with a supported security partner and route and filter internet traffic from Virtual Networks (VNets) or branch locations within a region. Hubs can be deployed in multiple Azure regions to ensure connectivity and security globally, using the security partnerâ€™s offering for Internet/SaaS application traffic and Azure Firewall for private traffic in the secured hubs.

The supported security partners are Zscaler, Check Point, and iboss.

If your solution will connect with Microsoft 365, you can follow the guidance from the [Microsoft 365 Networking Partner Program](/microsoft-365/enterprise/microsoft-365-networking-partner-program) to ensure alignment with [Microsoft 365 network connectivity principles](/microsoft-365/enterprise/microsoft-365-network-connectivity-principles). This program aims to facilitate a great customer experience with Microsoft 365 by providing validated partner solutions that consistently meet key principles for optimal connectivity in customer deployments.
