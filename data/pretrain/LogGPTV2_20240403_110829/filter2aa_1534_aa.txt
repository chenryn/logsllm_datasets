Abstract 
Women’s health is big business. There are a staggering
number of applications for Android and iOS which claim
to help people keep track of their monthly cycle, know
when they may be fertile, or track the status of their
pregnancy. These apps entice the user to input the most
intimate details of their lives, such as their mood, sexual
activity, physical activity, physical symptoms, height,
weight, and more. But how private are these apps, and
how secure are they in fact? After all, if an app has such
intimate details about our private lives, it would make
sense to ensure that it is not sharing those details with
anyone, such as another company or an abusive family
member. To this end, EFF and Gizmodo reporter
Kashmir Hill have taken a look at some of the privacy and
security properties of nearly twenty different fertility and
pregnancy tracking applications. While this is not a
comprehensive investigation of these applications by any
means, we did uncover several privacy issues, some
notable security flaws, and a few interesting security
features in the applications we examined. We conclude
that while these applications may be fun to use, and in some cases useful to the people who need
them, women should carefully consider the privacy and security tradeoffs before deciding to use
any of these applications.

Pregnant​” published by Kashmir Hill on jezebel.com.  
Methods 
For this report we tested the following apps: Glow, Nurture, Eve, pTracker, Clue, What to
Expect, Pregnancy+, WebMD Baby, Pinkpad, Flo, MyCalendar (Book Icon), MyCalendar (Face

using the Jadx decompiler and Android Studio, and analysis using the Kryptowire Enterprise
Mobile Management tool.  
MITM Proxy 
MITM Proxy is a proxy server which is able to intercept
and decrypt HTTPS connections by installing a custom
root certificate on the target device which is then used for
all SSL connections. MITM Proxy is then able to decrypt
and record a flow of plaintext and HTTPS traffic for
inspection. MITM proxy can also be used to edit and
replay requests. For this research we used MITM
x`x`Proxy to inspect network traffic, review the APIs
(Application Programming Interfaces) used by these
applications, and determine which third parties are being
contacted and what information is being sent to them. 
Jadx and Android Studio 
JADX is a decompiler for Android packages which is
4
able to produce Java code that can be viewed and edited
in the Android Studio programming environment. This
technique was used to determine why and how certain
permissions were used and other key information about
the applications.  
Kryptowire 
Kryptowire is a proprietary Android application analysis platform which was generously
5
donated to EFF for this research. Kryptowire was used to quickly scan a large number of
applications for personal information leaks, common vulnerabilities, and excessive permissions.  
Using Kryptowire, we were able to quickly discover issues in several applications, such as location
leaks and bad programming practices including world readable preferences. We were also able to
see where and how certain Android APIs were being used (for example, we found many
applications requesting the name of the user’s network operator) presumably for advertising
purposes. 
We were also able to quickly triage several applications that were not in our original set to
determine whether they would require further manual analysis. Triaging these applications

would have taken several days of manual analysis, but using Kryptowire, we were able to do this
work in a matter of minutes.  
Security Issues 
The “Glow” family of applications (Glow, Nurture, and Eve), as well as “Clue” all use certificate
pinning—a technique which prevents someone with a fraudulently issued SSL certificate from
intercepting traffic. This is a step not even taken by most banking apps, and it is certainly a good
way to protect against a certain class of attack. Unfortunately, this same property prevents us
from inspecting the HTTPS traffic of these apps with MITM Proxy, meaning we are unable to
do further dynamic analysis on these applications.  
Certificate pinning is a desirable—if esoteric—security feature to include. On the other hand,
none of the apps examined support two-factor authentication, which may have been a more
practical step for securing users’ information against common attacks.  
Code execution and content injection 
Several
apps
(What
to
Expect,
WebMD
Baby,
Pregnancy+, and both apps named MyCalendar) make
unencrypted requests for HTML content which were
then displayed to the user. This raises the possibility of a
man in the middle code execution attack against these
applications. None of the applications appears to do any
sanitizing of the input that they receive from the
unencrypted HTML request.  
Both MyCalendar applications fetch advertisements
meant for display over an unencrypted connection,
raising the further possibility of a man in the middle
content injection. What’s more, MyCalendar (Face
Icon) makes an unauthenticated HTTPS request to the
ajax.googleapis.com CDN to get a copy of the jQuery library. An attacker who can create a self
signed certificate for ajax.googleapis.com could inject their own copy of the jQuery library in it’s
place. This could potentially allow for the possibility of code execution within the application,
and even account takeover, if Jquery is used to handle authentication at all, though the researcher
has not confirmed this.

Account Hijacking 
Pinkpad, WebMD Baby, The Bump, and MyCalendar (Book Icon) send unencrypted user
authentication cookies over the network. This means that a man in the middle attacker could
easily take over a user’s account. This is an extremely severe security flaw. No application should
be making any unencrypted requests when ​free SSL certificates are available, and certainly not
requests containing user authentication tokens.  
Unencrypted Requests 
What to expect, Eve, Pregnancy+, pTracker, WebMD Baby, Pinkpad, and both MyCalendar
apps make plaintext HTTP requests to app servers and third party servers. Of those, pTracker,
and MyCalendar (Book Icon) only make third party requests unencrypted while MyCalendar
(Face Icon), Eve, and Pregnancy+ only make unencrypted requests to first party servers. This
issue has been fixed in Eve as of this report.  
As we stated above, unencrypted requests should be considered harmful due to the high
probability of data leakage, code execution, and account hijacking. The industry best practice
would be to not ever send any unencrypted data to another server and we recommend that all
applications do this immediately.  
Privacy Issues 
Third Party Trackers 
When an application makes an internet connection to a domain other than one owned by the
company that made it, this is called a Third Party connection. Third party connections are often
used for analytics, content delivery and advertising. Some common third parties that applications
connect to include Doubleclick, Google, Facebook, Crashlytics, and Amazon. All third party
connections​ have the ability to uniquely identify your phone and track which applications you
are using on it (and sometimes more detailed information as well). Third party connections may
purposefully or accidentally reveal sensitive information about the user. When found in
conjunction with applications that record intimate details about our health and sex life, this can
be especially troubling.  
Almost all of the applications we tested make requests to third party servers, the notable
exception being Fertility Friend. The application with the largest number of third party
connections is The Bump, which connects to over 18 different third party domains. The most
popular third party services are Google and Facebook, which both appear in 15 different
ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION 
EFF.ORG              6 
applications, followed by Doubleclick (owned by Google) which appears in 13 different
applications, and Crashlytics (owned by Google) in 11 different applications.  
Glow and Eve were both observed sending the phone’s IMEI (a permanent serial number for the
device) to the Appsflyer third party server. The IMEI can be used to uniquely identify a device
across multiple apps even if the phone is factory reset or a new operating system is installed. Due
to the massive privacy problems this presents, many developers have switched to using the
“mobile advertising id,” which Google and Apple both support and which can be changed by the
user. We reported this issue to Glow (which also makes Eve) and were informed that it has been
fixed in the latest version.  
We observed that “Flo” sends the following data in a request to the Facebook Graph API: 
custom_events_file: [{ 
"_ui":"unknown","_session_id":"7480e02d-1eb6-4216-bfaf-xxxx
xxxx", 
"_eventName":"SESSION_FINISHED_FIRST_LAUNCH","graph":"true"
, 
  "event_added":"true","_logTime":1484779886, 
  "Menstruation_changes":"true" 
}] 
Apparently this API is used for analytics and conversion tracking by the developer. According to
Facebook:  
Facebook does not share any app event data sent on your behalf to advertisers or other  
third parties, unless we have your permission or are required to do so by law. 
It is unclear how much privacy protection this statement actually offers. Facebook also stores this
data along with the user’s advertising ID, mentioned above, meaning this data could potentially
be linked to data from other apps as well.

Pin Locks 
pTracker, Clue, MyCalendar (Book), MyCalendar (Face),
Fertility Friend, Pinkpad, Flo, Maya, and WebMD Baby all
support a PIN code for access. While this is better than
nothing for protecting data from a local attacker (e.g. an
abusive partner or guardian), it falls far short of offering
effective security.  
The pin code does not appear to offer any encryption, thus
any attacker who can gain root access to the phone would
be able to extract data from the applications. Additionally,
none of the pin codes have any limit on the number of tries
or any sort of delay, and most of them limit the pin to 4
digits, making them fairly easy targets on which to perform
a brute force attack. Maya will email a reset code to your
email account, which is presumably also accessible from the
user’s phone, making the pin lock useless. MyCalendar
(Book Icon) stores backup data in plaintext on the SD card,
rendering the pin code entirely useless. Therefore, we
conclude that these pin codes are unreliable for the purpose
of ensuring data security.  
Unauthenticated Email 
What To Expect has several API endpoints which could allow a malicious actor to send a large
number of emails to an email address of their choice. While the attacker does not get to choose
the contents of the mail, they could still flood a person’s inbox with a large number of unwanted
emails,  causing a nuisance.  
The What to Expect API also allows one to sign up for a large number of mailing lists without
confirming the receiving address. Using this, one could sign their friends up for several dozen
mailing lists without any confirmation.

Information Leaks 
We found several information leaks during the course of our research, some of which were quite
disturbing. The MyCalendar app, for example, writes a log of everything that you enter into it
into a text file which is stored on the SD card, as seen in Figure 4. The fact that this is written to
the SD card means that any other application or person with access to the user’s phone could
trivially read it and learn detailed personal information.  
The Alt12 family of applications (Pinkpad and Baby Bump) were both found to send the user’s
6
precise GPS coordinates to the alt12 application server every time the application was opened.
The applications give no indication to the user that this is happening. We can only guess as to
why the application does this, perhaps for the purposes of geo-targeted advertising. Glow,
Pregnancy+, What to Expect, and WebMD Baby were all found to access the user’s location.
Regardless of why the location is accessed and recorded, it is an extremely subtle and disturbing
invasion of privacy. 
Files Not Deleted 
One application we tested, The Bump, had a feature which allowed users to upload a picture of
themselves while pregnant (called a “belly photo”) or a photo of their children. We discovered
that deleting these pictures in the application did not cause the pictures to be removed from the
6 https://www.alt12.com/ 
ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION 
EFF.ORG              9 
server, leaving them available to be accessed publicly. This is, of course, unexpected behavior and
could be a severe issue if someone using this application uploaded a photo including personal or
private information that they later wished to remove.  
Permissions 
We also performed a cursory examination of the permissions required by each application. Get
Baby is unique in that it requires zero permissions for use. pTracker requires only one
permission, and most of the applications require only 2 or 3 permissions. On the opposite end of
the spectrum, Pregnancy+ requires 9 different permissions. It’s also important to note that the
number of permissions does not directly correlate with the degree of privacy an application
offers. 
Most of the apps request the SD card permission, which is used to store data, cache, and photos
from the app and is generally harmless. Several of the applications, however, request location
permission to determine fine-grained location information. The researcher is unable to determine
