The `apache-airflow-providers-google` package locks the `google-ads` package
to an unsupported version.
The maximum supported Google Ads API with the Apache Airflow google provider
package is now stuck at `v5`.  
The current supported version (until Jun 2022) is `v8`.
Hence the Apache Airflow package breaks all Google Ads functionality (API
calls with the package Google Ads client are all rejected).
As a user of Airflow, I would expect to be able to upgrade google-ads
individually.
