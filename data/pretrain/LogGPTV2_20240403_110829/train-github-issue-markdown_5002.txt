The `apache-airflow-providers-google` package currently locks the `google-ads` dependency to an unsupported version, specifically `v5`. However, the most recent supported version of the Google Ads API, as of June 2022, is `v8`. This discrepancy results in all Google Ads functionality being non-operational when using the Apache Airflow Google provider, as API calls made through the Google Ads client are rejected.

As a user of Apache Airflow, I would expect the ability to independently upgrade the `google-ads` package to ensure compatibility and access to the latest features and support.
