CORP.CONTOSO.COM
Remarks
Realm flags are stored in the registry under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\Kerberos\Domains\. This entry doesn't exist in the registry by default. You can use the ksetup addrealmflags command to populate the registry.
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\Kerberos\Domains\
The realm flags specify other features of a Kerberos realm that aren't based on the Windows Server operating system. Computers running Windows Server can use a Kerberos server to administer authentication in the Kerberos realm instead of using a domain running a Windows Server operating system. This registry entry establishes the features of the realm and is as follows:
