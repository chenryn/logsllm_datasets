User: Is there any way to resize the command-line / interpreter window/pane in pudb, just like the size of the side pane can be adjusted?
Assistant: Put the focus in the command-line / interpreter pane (using Ctrl-x).
Use the right-arrow key to put the focus on the Clear button. (the background changes color to indicate it is selected)
Now use any of the following commands:


_ (underscore; makes that pane the smallest size possible)
= (equals; makes that pane the largest size possible)
+ (plus; increases the size of that pane with each press)
- (minus; decreases the size of that pane with each press)
