a network are not traversed by any path with positive weight
(given by the set of demands), and similarly when nodes are
never visited by such paths, they can be removed from the
routing language and even from the network itself, without
affecting the hazard value at all.
We now argue that the chosen deﬁnition of hazard value
indeed satisﬁes these intuitions. As we show, there is no need
to consider each of these properties one-by-one. Instead, we
can state many of them in one general claim by explointing
homomorphisms, i.e. link preserving mappings, between net-
works.
Deﬁnition 10 (Homomorphism). A homomorphism from net-

work G = (cid:2)V, E, src, dst(cid:3) to network G
(cid:2)

is a pair (f, g) of functions f : V → V
(cid:2) and g : E → E
(cid:2)
such that f (src(e)) = src
(g(e))
for all e ∈ E.

Mapping one network to another using a homomorphism
allows us to consider the relationships between the routing
tables, DFPs, and weight functions of the two networks. For
example, if we remove an unconnected node x from the set
of nodes V of a network G, this leads to a set of nodes
ˆV = V /{x} in a network ˆG, while keeping the set of edges
ˆE = E unchanged. This removal can be captured by a natural
homomorphism from ˆG to G, taking the identity functions for
f : ˆV → V and g : ˆE → E. Similarly, if we add an edge e to
the set of edges E of a network G, this leads to a new network
G with the same set of nodes V = V and an extended set of
edges E = E ∪ {e}, and we obtain a natural homomorphism
f : V → V , g : E → E by again using the identity functions.
Having identity functions as homomorphisms simply means
that all the paths in the left-hand network are also paths in
the right-hand network. Having more complicated functions
as homomorphisms, means that some nodes or edges are
merged, i.e. the routing functions of two nodes or edges in
the left network are merged in a single node or edge with the
combined functionality in the right network.
As an example, Figure 2 shows a network homomorphism
in which two nodes are merged, and one node is added, but
no link merges take place. This results in a homomorphism
in which g is injective but h is not. Note, that when thinking
about failure scenarios in such networks, it is easy to imag-
ine how separate link failures in the left network result in
corresponding link failures in the right network. However, to
understand how node failures are transferred, one needs to
realize that—in our way of modelling failures—a node failure
cannot be distinguished from a simultaneous failure of all
corresponding links in the network. A network homomorphism
treats node failures simply as if they are coinciding failures

of all connected links. This means that, if there are additional
links in the right network, a node failure of the lower node
on the left in Figure 2 may lead to a failure scenario on the
right that cannot be immediately interpreted as a node failure
as well.
(cid:2) (or more precisely g(R∩ Paths) ⊆ R
Regardless of what a homomorphism looks like, it tells us
how the paths in the left network compare to the paths in
the right network. So, given a homomorphism f : V → V
(cid:2)
and g : E → E
(cid:2), from a network G to a network G
(cid:2),
and a set of routes R in network G, the function g of a
homomorphism maps these routes to a set g(R) of paths the
right network. We can then verify that these paths are still
routes by making the comparison g(R) ⊆ R
(cid:2)
(cid:2) to the routes R
(cid:2)∩ Paths
(cid:2)
in network G
if we want to capture that we only consider routes that are
not only part of the regular language of allowed routes, but
also actually present as paths through the graph). We can
also verify that the weight of a connection between nodes s
and t has not changed, by comparing the weight functions:

two networks G and G
(cid:2),
regarding the connectivity scenarios associated with G and G
we can draw conclusions about possible changes in the hazard
value from this.
Theorem 1 (Hazard decrease). Let (cid:2)G, R, φ, W, D(cid:3) and
(cid:2)G

The reason for requiring that we do not merge any links (i.e.
require g to be injective), is that merging links may directly
result in merging of set of failures that were previously inde-
pendent. This increased dependency between failure scenarios
may cause a rise in the hazard value, as illustrated next.
A rise in hazard value can occur when two nodes are
merged, but also when the weight between any two nodes
and for any demand decreases, while the maximum attainable
weight for any demand remains the same. Also, if we have a
(cid:2)
(cid:2) and all the ‘new’ routes in G
homomorphism from G to G
have weight 0, the hazard value does not decrease because of
those new routes. And ﬁnally, if the probability of all failures
increases (except the empty failure in which nothing fails),
the hazard value increases as well. Note, however, that these
increases can even be concluded if edges are merged in the
(cid:2).

As a corollary, when the conditions of both theorems hold,
the hazard value remains equal. In particular, this is the case
if we have an isomorphism between networks,
if the
networks are the same up to the router and link names.

B. Compositionality
Apart from the monotonicity properties discussed in the
previous section, our deﬁnition of hazard value is also com-

Furthermore, the hazard value is—to a certain degree—
compositional with respect to the combination of independent
DFPs. To show this, we ﬁrst have to consider what it means
to combine two different DFPs.
(cid:2) represent two DFPs deﬁned on the same
network G. When both failures can occur independently of
one another, this leads to a combined DFP deﬁned by the
convolution:
Let φ and φ

While it is impossible to consider at a general level what
the exact effect is of combining two DFPs in this way on the
hazard value, it is possible to determine a bound. After all, we
expect that introducing a new source of failure may increase
the hazard value. Furthermore, we can show that the combined
hazard value is never larger than the weighted sum of hazard
values of the separate scenario, where the weights represent
the condition that the failures occur in isolation.
