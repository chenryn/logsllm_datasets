more complex compared with the strong attacker model. Thus for
the weak attacker model, we perform the simulation on a smaller
generated AS topology. There are a number of topology generators
such as BRITE [11], GT-ITM [19] and Inet [17]. We chose Inet as
our topology generator because of its close match with the known
characteristics of the AS-level graph. This provides us with the
AS-level topology graph, however the models do not provide as-
sociated IP address origination information for each generated AS,
nor do they indicate how AS PATH prepending could occur in the
generated topology. Based on empirical observations, we assume
that prepending behavior follows a power-law distribution in the
Internet. We replicate this distribution in our generated topologies.
To verify our generated topologies, we ran our computations for the
strong attacker model on both the full-size AS topology extracted
from RouteViews, and the generated topology. The two sets of re-
sults were closely matched, indicating that the generated topology
was likely to be an adequate approximation to the actual AS topol-
ogy for our purposes.
4.6 Trafﬁc
To compute Equation 1 in Section 4.3, a model of the trafﬁc
load of each possible route on the Internet is needed. Gathering
accurate data on actual inter-AS trafﬁc is impractical since this data
is usually conﬁdential. Thus for our simulations we approximate
the trafﬁc load for each route in four different ways:
• Uniform: Here the trafﬁc is assumed to be uniform between
any two pairs of ASes.
• Product of the two endpoint ASes’ IP Spaces: An AS’s IP
space is the number of addresses that it originates to the In-
ternet. If we assume that the Internet’s IP space is uniformly
populated by hosts, and each host communicates uniformly
with all other hosts on the Internet, then the amount of end-
to-end trafﬁc between two ASes will be proportional to the
product of the two AS’s IP spaces.
• Product of the logarithm of the two endpoint ASes’ IP Space:
This reﬂects the trend of large IP spaces to be more sparsely
populated but the smaller ones are densely populated.
• Gravitational Model: Following the results from Zhang et
al. [20], we have also considered the model where the traf-
ﬁc between two hosts is proportional to the product of the IP

space and inversely proportional to the square distance be-
tween them.
Trafﬁc(s,d) = IPs × IPd
hopcount2
We note that despite the marked differences in each of these met-
rics, our results in Sections 6 and 8 hold equally well for all of them,
indicating that the ﬁndings are insensitive to the trafﬁc model.
5. ANALYSIS: STRONG ATTACKER
In this section, we describe the details of how we determine the
security level of a given route for each of the ﬁve security schemes
described in Section 3 under the strong attacker model described
in Section 4.2. Under this attacker model, we assume that the at-
tacker is able to read unencrypted BGP trafﬁc anywhere in the In-
ternet. Note that in this section we use the terms path and route
interchangeably.
5.1 Origin Authentication
In this section we describe how we assess the security of a path
given that some security scheme with only the Origin Authentica-
tion security property is partially deployed on the Internet.
As we explain in Section 4.5, we assume that ASes prefer short-
est path routes. Hence, if an adversary is able to falsely advertise a
shorter path to the preﬁx to any AS on the legitimate path, then it is
able to divert the legitimate path to itself. It can do so in two ways:
preﬁx hijacking or path spooﬁng.
Figure 1 illustrates a preﬁx hijacking attack using this process.
The circles represent ASes, the legitimate originator of the preﬁx
is the destination AS D of the trafﬁc, and the AS at the other end
of the path is the source AS S. The malicious AS is denoted by M
and it is performing an attack at some given AS in the path denoted
by W (W could be any AS along the path). Let d(A, B) denote the
distance in AS-hops between A and B. In the ﬁgure, M is illegally
originating D’s preﬁx. In the absence of authenticating information
W is unable to determine which originator is legitimate, and so we
assume it simply chooses the closer AS in terms of hops. This
attack succeeds whenever one or both of D or W have not deployed
origin authentication, and d(M,W) < d(D,W).
If both D and W have deployed origin authentication then the
attacker must perform path spooﬁng, i.e., advertise a short path to
the originator D instead of originating the preﬁx directly. Figure 2
describes this attack. The malicious AS falsely advertises itself
Figure 4: Path spooﬁng with full security
as being adjacent to the originator D in an attempt to cause W to
choose its path over the legitimate path. This attack succeeds if
1 + d(M,W) < d(D,W).
5.2 First-hop Authentication (OA+1), SPV
Recall from Section 3 that in First-hop Authentication, both the
origin and the ﬁrst hop AS along the path from the origin are au-
thenticated and thus cannot be altered by an adversary. We use
the term “Origin Authentication +1” (OA+1) to denote this class of
schemes that performs one extra hop of authentication in addition
to origin authentication. Note that with OA+1, the path-spooﬁng
attack in Figure 2 fails if both D and W have deployed OA+1. Un-
der the strong attacker model for SPV, the attacker can eavesdrop
on the route advertisement as soon as the originating AS sends it
to the ﬁrst-hop AS. This allows it to perform arbitrary alterations
to the route after the ﬁrst hop, thus it has the same properties as
OA+1. For brevity, we only discuss OA+1 in this section.
Figure 3 reﬂects what an adversary M now has to do to subvert
the path if both D and W have deployed OA+1. M is no longer able
to directly claim a link to the originating AS D since D now signs
the identities of each legitimate ﬁrst-hop AS adjacent to itself. M
can, however, illegally advertise a link to the ﬁrst-hop AS F instead.
Hence, this attack succeeds if 2 + d(M,W) < d(D,W). Note that
directly performing preﬁx hijacking is still the preferable method
of attack if either of D or W have not deployed any security.
5.3 Full Path Security: S-BGP, soBGP
Under the strong attacker model, security schemes with Routing
Topology Path Veriﬁcation and Path Authentication have similar
security properties. We call this class of schemes, the schemes with
full path security under the strong attacker model. We describe the
properties of each representative protocol in turn.
S-BGP: In S-BGP, the entire AS PATH is protected by signa-
tures as far as the nearest non-deploying AS. Once the closest non-
deploying AS is encountered, the chain of security is broken and
further ASes down the path are unable to provide additional secu-
rity even if they are deployers of S-BGP, since a malicious attacker
could simply strip away any signatures and cryptographic informa-
tion added on after the ﬁrst insecure AS.
Figure 4 reﬂects what an adversary M now has to do to subvert
the path if both D and W are deployers of S-BGP. The shaded cir-
cles represent ASes that have deployed S-BGP which form a con-
tiguous area with the originator D. The attacker’s best opportunity
to present a short path to the originator is to falsely claim a link to
C, which is the unsecured AS that is closest to D. Hence, in this
case the attack succeeds if d(D,C)+1+ d(M,W) < d(D,W). Note
that since d(D,C) ≥ 1, full path security is always at least as secure
as OA+1.
soBGP: Under soBGP or any other Routing Topology Path Veriﬁ-
cation protocol, paths are veriﬁed to be consistent against a database
of known inter-AS routing information. However, recall from Sec-
tion 3 that in our analysis, we only allow soBGP to use authenti-
cated topological information from ASes that are soBGP speakers.
An attacker is thus free to perform path spooﬁng attacks as long
as any edges in the spoofed path incident to a secure AS are cor-
rectly veriﬁable under soBGP. Referring to Figure 4 once more, it
is clear that an attacker’s best strategy for creating the shortest pos-
sible spoofed path under such a constraint, is to advertise a false
link from itself to C, which is the closest insecure AS to D. This
is exactly identical to the attack against S-BGP, and hence soBGP
has the same security properties as S-BGP under the strong attacker
model.
6. RESULTS: STRONG ATTACKER
In this section we present and discuss the results of performing
the computations under our simulation-based model for estimating
the adoptability of the various protocols under the Strong Attacker
model.
6.1 Critical Threshold
Recall from Section 4.1 that the security beneﬁt of an AS is a
value in the interval [0,1], reﬂecting the estimated increase in the
probability that any given bit passing through an AS cannot be
diverted, after this AS adopts a security protocol. The switching
threshold models the adoption transition cost of the protocol: for
any given AS, if the security beneﬁt is below the switching thresh-
old, the AS will not adopt the protocol in the next iteration; oth-
erwise, the AS will become a new adopter in the next iteration.
Hence, by varying the switching threshold from 0 to 1, we can run
our simulation to determine how far adoption will spread for any
given value of the switching threshold.
For each given switching threshold, we measure the ﬁnal frac-
tion of all ASes which are secure protocol adopters (including the
set of initial adopters) when the algorithm has converged. Our sim-
ulation terminates when no new ASes are found to be adopters in
an iteration. This means that any ASes which are still not adopters
must have a lower security beneﬁt than the switching threshold.
Figure 5 shows the ﬁnal fraction of total adopters as the switch-
ing threshold changes. For reference, the fraction of adopters in the
ﬁrst iteration for each threshold level is also indicated. It is clear
that the fraction of ﬁnal adopters exhibits a sharp transition between
very low adoption and complete adoption at c = 0.023. This sharp
transition contrasts with the relatively smooth curve of the fraction
of adopters in the ﬁrst iteration, indicating that it is a characteris-
tic of the adoption process resulting from multiple iterations of our
simulation.
Our results indicate a critical threshold adoption dynamic where
adoption is stalled at a low level when the switching threshold is
above the critical threshold but is essentially complete whenever
the switching threshold is below the critical threshold. We observed
the critical threshold adoption dynamic in every simulation regard-
less of topology, adversary model (weak or strong attacker), path
weighting metrics, or various trafﬁc and IP-space ownership dis-
tributions. The critical threshold dynamic is due to the positive

feedback inherent in the system—each AS that adopts the protocol
improves the potential beneﬁt of other ASes to adopt the protocol
because the beneﬁts of adoption increases as more ISPs adopt the
protocol. Hence, as long as the switching threshold of adoption is
sufﬁciently low to sustain a positive rate of adoption for several ini-
tial iterations, positive feedback will result in eventual full adoption
in the rest of the Internet.
The existence of a critical threshold is signiﬁcant because we
are now able to quantitatively measure adoptability for any secure
BGP protocol under a given set of assumptions by a single scalar,
i.e., the value of the critical threshold. A scheme with a higher crit-
ical threshold can yield full adoption for a larger range of possible
switching thresholds, and is thus considered to be more adoptable.
For our subsequent analyses, we formally deﬁne the following:
Deﬁnition 1 A protocol’s adoptability is measured by its critical
threshold. This is the supremum of the set of switching thresholds
for which the ﬁnal fraction of adopting ASes is greater than 0.5.
6.2 Adoptability of Different Security Schemes
We next investigate the relative adoptability of each of the three
classes of security schemes described in Section 5 for the strong
attacker model. The three classes are: full security (e.g., S-BGP,
soBGP, or SPV), origin authentication only (OA), and ﬁrst hop au-
thentication (OA+1). Figure 6 shows the ﬁnal adoption fractions
of each scheme as the switching threshold c changes. All three
schemes show critical threshold dynamics, switching abruptly from
full adoption to almost no adoption when c increases beyond a crit-
ical value. The critical threshold for OA is lower than that of OA+1
which is only very slightly lower than that of full path security, indi-
cating a range of switching thresholds where full path security and
OA+1 will achieve full adoption while OA achieves little adoption.
This reﬂects the expected result that OA is less adoptable than full
security, since OA’s security properties are weaker. However, we
also observe the surprising result that OA+1 has almost the same
adoptability as full security. This is despite the fact that OA+1,
which only protects the ﬁrst hop in its AS PATH, has signiﬁcantly
weaker security properties than full security, which protects the en-
tire AS PATH.
In Figure 7, we show the critical thresholds after varying the
initial deployment set. We can observe that T1 deployment yields
in a much higher critical threshold than GOV or UNIV deployment.
The critical threshold in T1 is higher even when the number of ASes
is ten times fewer than other deployments. This is expected because
