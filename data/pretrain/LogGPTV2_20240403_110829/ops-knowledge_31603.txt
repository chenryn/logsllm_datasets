User: Is there any difference between:
__file__
and 
sys.argv[0]
Because both seem to be doing the same thing: they hold the name of the script.
If there is no difference, then why is it that __file__ is used in almost all someplaces whereas I have never seen sys.argv[0] being used.
Assistant: It's only the same if you are in the "main" script of your python programm. If you import other files, __file__ will contain the path to that file, but sys.argv will still hold the same values.
