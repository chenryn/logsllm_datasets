**Question:**

Is there a configuration file where I can set the default working directory for IDLE? Currently, it defaults to my home directory, but I want to change it to another directory when it starts. I know I can use `import os` followed by `os.chdir("path/to/directory")`, but this is inconvenient. It would be more convenient if there were a configuration file that I could edit to change this setting, but I have not been able to find one.

I have checked the desktop entry for IDLE on my Ubuntu system, located at `/usr/share/applications/idle-python3.2.desktop`. This file does not contain a configuration file, but it points to `/usr/lib/python3.2/idlelib/PyShell.py`. In the same folder, there are `config-*.def` files, with `config-main.def` being the most likely candidate. However, I cannot find where the default path is specified or how it can be changed. It seems that the path might be hard-coded in `PyShell.py`, though I am not entirely sure due to my limited knowledge of Python. I will continue to look, but I would appreciate any help from someone who knows the answer. Thank you in advance.

**Answer:**

To change the default working directory for IDLE on macOS (if you launch IDLE as an application by double-clicking it), you can follow these steps. Note that this solution is permanent and will not require you to change the directory every time you launch IDLE.

1. **Locate the Resource File:**
   - Open Finder and navigate to the IDLE application in the Applications folder (inside the Python folder).
   - Right-click on the IDLE application and select "Show Package Contents."
   - Navigate to `Contents > Resources`.
   - In the Resources folder, locate the file named `idlemain.py`.

2. **Grant Write Permissions:**
   - Right-click on `idlemain.py` and select "Get Info."
   - Scroll down to the "Sharing & Permissions" section.
   - Click the lock icon in the bottom right corner and enter your password to unlock the permissions.
   - Click the "+" button under the list of users with permissions.
   - Add yourself to the list (select your user account).
   - Change the permission for your user account from "Read only" to "Read & Write."
   - Click the lock icon again to relock the permissions.

3. **Edit the Default Working Directory:**
   - Open `idlemain.py` with a text editor (you can use IDLE, TextEdit, or any other text editor).
   - Look for the import statements at the top of the file.
   - Below the import statements, you will find the code that sets the default working directory. Replace the existing line with:
     ```python
     os.chdir('path/to/your/desired/working/directory')
     ```
   - For example, if you want to set the working directory to `/Users/YourName/Documents/Python`, the line should look like this:
     ```python
     os.chdir('/Users/YourName/Documents/Python')
     ```

4. **Save and Verify:**
   - Save the changes to `idlemain.py`.
   - Next time you start IDLE, it should open in your desired working directory.
   - You can verify the current working directory by running the following commands in the IDLE shell:
     ```python
     import os
     print(os.getcwd())
     ```

This method provides a permanent solution for changing the default working directory in IDLE on macOS. If you launch IDLE from the command line, you may need a different approach.
