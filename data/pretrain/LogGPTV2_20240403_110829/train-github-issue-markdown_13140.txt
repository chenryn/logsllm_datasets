We recently migrated our ES 1.1.1 cluster to ES 1.2.2, after that we found
that one field 'displayPublishedDateTime', which is defined as
dataOptionalTime type in the mapping, seems corrupted and not able to order by
it in the query.  
In the query, when order by desc on it, its sort value is '\b', and order by
asc, its sort value is shown as '' \u0001\u0000\u0000\u0000(aC3@X", see the
following query and results. In other queries, which order by
'displayPublishedDateTime', the order actually didn't take effect. It looks
like that Elasticsearch was unable to get the correct sort value for this
field.
