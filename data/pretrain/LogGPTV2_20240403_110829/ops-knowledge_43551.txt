User: New to programming and python altogether. In the book I'm learning from, the author suggested I find out the purpose of Pydoc.
I did a google search on it, and found a match (from Gnome Terminal) but it didn't make much sense to me. Anyone mind simplifying a bit?
Assistant: pydoc generates online documentation from docstrings...
for example you can see that Numpy.histograms() function's, online documentation is actually made based on that function docstring...
