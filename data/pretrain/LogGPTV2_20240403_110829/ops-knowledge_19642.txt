User:  team's code base needs to be version controlled, please provide a suitable version control solution.
Assistant: suitable version control solution should have the following characteristics: 1. Distributed: Team members can work locally and synchronize changes to the main warehouse. 2. Multi-person collaboration: Team members can work collaboratively in the same code base, and code merging can be managed through some mechanisms. 3. Provide historical records: can record the history of each code submission, and can roll back to any historical point. 4. Support branch management: It is easy to create branches to realize the development, testing and release of different functions. 5. Security: It can ensure that the code in the code base will not be lost or damaged, and can control permissions to ensure reasonable collaboration among team members. Based on the above requirements, Git is currently the most popular and suitable version control solution. It allows team members to quickly create local branches and merge code efficiently. In addition, the history of Git is also very clear and easy to manage. At the same time, Git also has a complete permission control mechanism, which can ensure the safe and efficient collaboration of code among team members.
