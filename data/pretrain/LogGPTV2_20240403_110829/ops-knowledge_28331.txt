User: On the server side, how to detect and limit malicious traffic attacks? Please give the corresponding implementation plan and technical tools.
Assistant: 1. Implementation plan (1) Traffic monitoring: Set monitoring rules, monitor the traffic of protocols such as TCP, UDP, ICMP, and HTTP, and make statistics on the traffic. Monitoring rules can be based on port, protocol, traffic volume, source address, destination address and other conditions. (2) Black and white list: Block known attack source IP addresses or malicious URLs to prevent access to malicious traffic. (3) Traffic filtering: use the traffic filter to filter traffic, filter out abnormal traffic and discard or reject it. Filtering rules can be configured based on conditions such as source IP address, destination IP address, and port. (4) IDS/IPS: Install Intrusion Detection System (IDS) or Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) to conduct in-depth inspection of traffic, discover and prevent various attacks in real time, such as DDoS attack, SQL injection, XSS attack, etc. 2. Technical tools (1) tcpdump: a command line tool that can capture network data packets, detect and analyze network traffic. (2) Wireshark: A network protocol analysis tool that can capture and analyze network packets, and perform detailed statistics and reports on the analysis results. (3) Snort: A rule-based intrusion detection tool that can be used to detect and defend against various network attacks, and supports custom rules and policies. (4) Suricata: A high-performance open source intrusion detection and prevention system that supports detection and analysis of multiple protocols, and has advanced traffic filtering functions.
