ABSTRACT
With the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) and big
data, high ﬁdelity localization and tracking systems that
employ cameras, RFIDs, and attached sensors intrude on
personal privacy. However, the beneﬁt of localization in-
formation sharing enables trend forecasting and automa-
tion. To address this challenge, we introduce Wobly, an
attribute based signature (ABS) that measures gait. Wobly
passively receives Wi-Fi beacons and produces human sig-
natures based on the Doppler Eﬀect and multipath signals
without attached devices and out of direct line-of-sight. Be-
cause signatures are speciﬁc to antenna placement and room
conﬁguration and do not require sensor attachments, the
identities of the individuals can remain anonymous. How-
ever, the gait based signatures are still unique, and thus
Wobly is able to track individuals in a building or home.
Wobly uses the physical layer channel and the unique human
gait as a means of encoding a person’s identity. We imple-
mented Wobly on a National Instruments Radio Frequency
(RF) test bed. Using a simple naive Bayes classiﬁer, the
correct identiﬁcation rate was 87% with line-of-sight (LoS)
and 77% with non-line-of-sight (NLoS).

carry stigma, cannot capture patients’ images or identities.
However, big data, which provide trends, contains insightful
information. People tracking technology monitors behaviors
and develops trust [6].
Traditional human tracking systems are performed by im-
age recognition, thus encountering privacy issues. Floor
sensors, wall attachments, and accelerometers are used to
measure human activity [34]. Devices like Radio-frequency
identiﬁcation (RFID) [27], door sensors, and ultrasonic sen-
sors [13] were able to track persons. These sensors are intru-
sive, requiring installation or personal attachment. Micro-
radars [23] utilize special signals and frequency ranges and
cause interference. Current tracking techniques require at-
tached devices, such as RFID, smart phones, cameras, or
other signal emitting device. Techniques like Hybrid Vari-
able Size Maximum Distance to Average Vector uses mi-
croaggregation to protect identity while preserving location [15].
Microaggregation causes loss of location ﬁdelity in order to
protect privacy. Access control and encryption limit data
availability, requiring authorized users [10].
To solve the problem of intrusion, IoTs process radio fre-
quency (RF) signals with software deﬁned radio (SDR) en-
abling ubiquitous mobile computations, environment sens-
ing [36] [41] [24] [11], human sensing [37] [2] [3], and move-
ment sensing [21] [26]. With directional antennas, IoTs can
improve localization by providing angular information in
Wi-Fi networks [31] and improving throughput by direct-
ing and localizing energy.
In this paper we used angular
and polarity features provided by directional horn antennas
to detect and identify humans. Wi-Fi standards, used by
much of IoT, employ Orthogonal Frequency Division Multi-
plexing (OFDM) for robustness, allowing the penetration of
walls. Currently, Channel State Information (CSI) is used
to measure network performance for application layer and to
avoid interference. By leveraging CSI, extracted pilot tones
and correlated signals, speciﬁc features can uniquely identify
individuals’ gait.
Gait characterization is based on the theory that all or-
ganisms utilize central pattern generators (CPG), which pro-
duce cyclical patterns produced by the spinal cord utilizing
feedback. The study of this phenomenon was ﬁrst credited
to Graham Brown [4] who managed to reproduce stepping
patterns without commands from the cortex. Further re-
search showed that special cells from the spinal cord utilized
feedback to produce patterns. Because of the unique aspects
of human bodies, such as size, leg length, walking cadence,
and foot and ankle angles, the signatures generated are cur-
rently used in forensics for identiﬁcation [16]. By measuring
571OFDM signals’ multipathings and Doppler shifts, feature
sets can identify a person’s gait and movement through a
hallway and behind a wall by using a ﬁxed antenna and SDR
receiver. Wobly passively acquires signal acquisition to form
signatures and thus does not interfere or require production
of special signals. This human Wi-Fi based signature is a
physical attribute-based signature which endorses localiza-
tion data [20] [39]. In contrast to previous gait and body
movement measuring techniques, this technique presented
in this paper does not require additional sensors such as pri-
vacy intrusive cameras, RFID tags, or ultrasound sensors.
In summary, the three fold contributions of this paper are
the following:
• Wobly allows for anonymous privacy preserving track-
ing and positioning based on human gait using Wi-Fi
signals. This SDR, biometric, and localization system
does not require attachment devices to persons and
works in NLoS scenarios.
• Wobly uses standard Wi-Fi beacon signals, works pas-
sively to measure Doppler shift and multipathing, and
does not require any special signals. The deployment
of Wobly followed modern Wi-Fi system architecture.
• Empirical results demonstrated identiﬁcation of 7 in-
dividuals at 3 locations in both LoS (87% correctness)
and NLoS (77% correctness) scenarios. The results
show that the signatures are location and room conﬁg-
uration speciﬁc. We implemented Wobly on a National
Instrument RF test bed.
2. MOTIVATION
This section discusses the need for sensors in diﬀerent IoT
applications, especially smart homes and oﬃce, intrusion
detection systems, behavior monitoring system, and health
care. The information gained from these data enables trend
predication, protection from insider threats, and physical
area intrusion detection. Embedding such sensors in walls
has beneﬁts to security and monitoring, preserving privacy
in localization data, and big data for health monitoring (Fig-
ure 1). Individual identiﬁcation can be used in stores, pro-
viding customized marketing data or advertisement. Chal-
lenges in all these IoT applications include privacy. The sig-
natures in this paper also provide high ﬁdelity localization
information, while anonymizing identities, as the signature
is unique to sensor locations.
2.1 Security Applications
With the increasing need of privacy protection and se-
curity from the rise in terrorism, it is critical to develop
technologies and sensors to enhance physical security. Phys-
ical Intrusion Detection System (IDS) has the ability to tag,
track, and identify individuals. Identiﬁcation and location
information are used in access control and behavior monitor-
ing systems. To counter insider-threats, the need to monitor
unusual behavior from internal personnel within buildings
requires human sensing and localization. Current IDS tech-
nology utilizes cameras, RFIDs, IRIS scanners, human voice,
infrared, and motion sensors. These sensors are used to pro-
tect homes, military and government installations, server
farms, and other sensitive locations. By including gait as
a hidden biometric, extra layer of restrictions provide addi-

tional security. The beneﬁts of NLoS and standard signals
with passive reception allows for clandestine monitoring.
2.2 Localization Privacy in Smart Buildings
Preserving privacy in localization and tracking data is crit-
ical for smart government facilities, businesses oﬃces, and
homes. Tracking individuals in these settings enhances phys-
ical security and enable trend forecasting, such as: access
control, customized directed marketing techniques, and per-
sonalized automation and preferences. Smart buildings that
detect the location of individuals can lower energy consump-
tion. People sensing enhances systems like Human Interac-
tions Computer Interactions
[14] and Building Operating
System Services [8]. However, current techniques require
cameras with face recognition algorithms, attached devices,
or smart phones, which all contain vulnerabilities. These
techniques are intrusive, insecure, and easily violate privacy
protection laws. Techniques used for protecting privacy in-
clude access control and microaggregation, which limits ac-
curacy and access to information. The high ﬁdelity localiza-
tion signatures discussed in this paper provide anonymiza-
tion using physical layer security, by encoding human gait
and physical channels.
2.3 Preserving Privacy in Healthcare
Current use of accelerometers and attached devices such
as smart phones allows for big data collection to detect
trends in healthcare. With additional features, such as lo-
cation and movement speed, these trends can provide in-
sight on disease progression and causes (Figure 2). Storing
such information in a health database helps predict trends
and diagnosis. Monitoring the elderly and young individ-
uals beneﬁt healthcare automation, and thus lower costs.
The data gathered from clinics are sensitive, as diseases
such as HIV carry stigma. Current technologies protect this
data by access control, thus limiting data availability. These
technologies contain vulnerabilities and may violate privacy
laws. With the ability to penetrate walls and anonymiza-
572tion,Wobly enables human sensing without attached equip-
ment and raises fewer privacy concerns.

disease [18]
3. THREAT MODEL
The threat that typically occurs with tracking systems is
that adversaries may access the location histories of the tar-
gets. Attackers may gain access to location tracking services,
camera recording systems, or targets’ IoTs such as smart
phones and wearables [5]. The access means are typically
software code fallacies, eavesdropping, socially engineered
techniques, or identity theft. The users of Wobly trust the
facility and believe that no other identity recording systems
are active.
Our assumptions are that adversaries, who may have ac-
cess to signatures, do not have access to the room conﬁgu-
ration and the targets simultaneously. For privacy, we also
assume that identities are not associated with the signatures
in any manner that exposes the sensitive information.
Figure 3: Wyner described a wiretap channel, showing Alice
communicating with Bob, with Eve as the eavesdropper.
Because Wobly depends on physical layer channel encryp-
tion, we can utilize Wyner, Cheong, and Hellma’s Wire-Tap
Channel model (Figure 3) [19]. Wyner relaxed Shannon’s
model by adding noise to transmitted channel. In Wyner’s
wiretap modem, W is the message sent, ˆW is the message
received, and Z is the entropy of the message. Wyner de-
ﬁned the equivocation or the confusion in Equation 1 and
perfect secrecy in Equation 2 for n channels.

Wobly, Wyner theory suggests that the more the adversary’s
channel is diﬀerent than the receiver’s channel, the more se-
cret Wobly will be. Therefore, we assume that the there are
no adversaries’ antennas placed close to Wobly’s antenna.
4. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
This section presents a design solution to several chal-
lenges in real-world Wi-Fi deployments and signal acqui-
sition. Section 4.1 discusses the RF test bed architecture
including antenna design for acquiring and processing the
RF signal. Section 4.2 shows the production of the Wi-Fi
beacon. Sections 4.3 discusses the Doppler and multipath
channel encoding caused by human gait and room conﬁgu-
rations. Section 4.4 explores the receiver and signal process-
ing. Sections 4.5 and 4.6 demonstrate techniques to measure
Doppler and multipath eﬀects forming signatures, and sec-
tion 4.7 discusses using wavelets to characterize signatures.
Challenges include 1) obtaining RF signals with high SNR
in homes and buildings; 2) designing the SDR system us-
ing standard modern Wi-Fi system deployments; and 3)
mitigating high possibility of interference in the open ISM
band. To simulate modern day RF in buildings, RF over
