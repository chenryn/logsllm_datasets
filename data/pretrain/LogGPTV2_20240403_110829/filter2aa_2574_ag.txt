 Digital Fingerprinting
A browser fingerprint is the set of technical information about the client OS and browser 
that can be used to distinguish a client machine online. Such technical information 
includes browser type, add-on installed, user agent, fonts installed, language settings, time 
zone, screen size, operating system (OS) version, and color depth, among other things.
Fingerprinting allows trackers to track a user’s machine even though cookies and 
JavaScript are disabled, and it allows them to distinguish a client machine among 
millions of connected devices. You may think that such technical information is generic 
and cannot be used to recognize a specific computing device. We’re afraid you are 
wrong because when such information is combined, you can draw a comprehensive 
unique picture about each user machine, and later, this information can be linked to a 
real identity if combined with other sensitive personal information (SPI) such as name, 
Social Security number, or phone number. This should effectively allow different outside 
parties to easily profile people without using traditional tracking techniques such as 
computer IP addresses and cookies.
There are two main types of device fingerprinting: script-based techniques and canvas.
 Script-Based Fingerprinting
This type works by loading a script—usually a JavaScript (Flash, Silverlight, and Java 
applets are also used)—into the user’s browser. This script will execute and collect 
technical information about user browsers and machine technical specifications such as 
screen resolution, CPU type, and other details about the targeted system. A hash is then 
made based on the collected information that is later used to identify and track your 
computer like an IP address.
The main defense against this technique is to disable JavaScript in your browser. 
However, this approach is not practical and may result in breaking many websites (the 
majority of web design frameworks are based on JavaScript to deliver functionality).
 Canvas Fingerprinting
Canvas is an HTML element used to draw graphics (lines, shapes, text, images) and 
animation on web pages using the JavaScript API. This technique is exploited by 
different actors—especially advertisers—to fingerprint browsers to profile people and 
track them online.
CHapTer 2  INTrOduCTION TO ONlINe THreaTS aNd COuNTermeaSureS

Canvas fingerprinting works by drawing an invisible image on the user’s client 
browser. Once drawn on the client browser, the image will collect different technical 
information about the user’s browser and OS. A hash is then created based on the 
collected information. This enables online trackers to track user online activities across 
different websites based on this hash, which is unique for each user’s client machine.
Browser fingerprinting is a powerful tool for tracking users across many websites. 
This type of tracking (also known as stateless tracking) raises serious privacy concerns 
since it is hard to detect and non-computer-savvy users may find it difficult to counter 
such techniques.
 HTML5
HTML5 is the latest version of HTML. It comes with new features that can be exploited to 
track users online. For instance, the HTML5 Web Storage feature—which is used to store 
offline contents on user machines—can be used to store tracking code like cookies do.
 Checking Your Digital Footprint
Fingerprinting is currently considered the greatest risk that faces users when surfing 
online. We cannot conduct secure OSINT searches without fully understanding this risk 
and working to avoid it. In the following section, we will show what your current digital 
fingerprint shows to the public by using two free services.
 Browserleaks
Browserleaks (https://browserleaks.com) is a web security testing tool that shows you 
what personal identity data may be leaked without your permissions when you surf the 
Internet.
 Panopticlick
Panopticlick (https://panopticlick.eff.org) is a research project created by the 
Electronic Frontier Foundation (https://www.eff.org/). It will analyze how well your 
browser and add-ons protect you against online tracking techniques.

 Secure Online Browsing
Earlier you learned how browsers can leak personal identifying information about 
you and your machine. In this section, we will cover how to configure your browser to 
become more private in addition and offer advice and tools to conceal your real digital 
fingerprint.
There are many desktop browsers; the market share is mainly divided between 
Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE), Mozilla Firefox, Safari, Opera, and Google Chrome. 
IE and its successor Edge come preinstalled on the Windows OS; however, we always 
encourage users to use open source software to assure maximum security when working 
online. Mozilla Firefox is still considered the only true open source browser of the main 
browsers mentioned, so in this book, we will cover how to make this browser more 
private.
Note! The epic browser is developed by a group called Hidden reflex and 
promotes privacy worldwide; this browser is based on Chromium (like Google’s 
Chrome browser) and comes with enhanced security features to eliminate  
online tracking. It also comes with a free built-in VpN to conceal your  
Ip address and protect your online communications. You can give it try at 
 https://epicbrowser.com/index.html.
 Configuring Firefox to Become More Private
In this section, we will give basic tips to secure your online browsing when using Firefox.
 Turning On Private Browsing
When you enable private browsing in Firefox, the browser will not record your visited 
pages, cookies, temporary files, and searches. Firefox will also activate tracking 
protection, which will block online trackers from monitoring your browsing history 
across multiple websites. To enable private browsing in Firefox, open the Firefox browser, 
and press Ctrl+Shift+ P. A new private browsing window will appear (see Figure 2-13).

 Changing the Firefox Settings to Become More Private
There are many tweaks to make your Firefox browser more private. In this section, we 
cover the main one.
Access the Firefox options by clicking the menu in the upper-right corner of your 
browser and selecting Options (see Figure 2-14).
Figure 2-13. A new private session window opened in the Firefox browser

Move to the Privacy tab. You need to turn on the option Use Tracking Protection in 
Private Windows. Now, go to the History section on the same page and select the option 
“Never remember history” so that Firefox will delete all your history every time you close 
it. Finally, go to the Location Bar section and disable all the suggestions in the search 
bar because the suggestion process can leak excessive data about you. Your Privacy tab 
should look like Figure 2-15.

online activities
Figure 2-15. Configuring the Privacy tab in the Firefox browser for better privacy
CHapTer 2  INTrOduCTION TO ONlINe THreaTS aNd COuNTermeaSureS
62
Move to the Security tab and configure it like in Figure 2-16.
Figure 2-16. Configuring the Security tab to stop phishing and dangerous websites
Go to “Privacy & Security” tab ➤ “Firefox Data Collection and Use” pane and disable 
the following options: Allow Firefox to send technical and interaction data to Mozilla and 
Allow Firefox to send backlogged crash reports on your behalf. We are using for this step 
Firefox Quantum edition—version number 61. Crash reports can contain valuable data 
about your computer status that can make you vulnerable if it falls into the wrong hands, 
so it is better to disable them.
While you are still on the Advanced tab, go to the Network subtab, and make sure 
that the option “Tell me when a website asks to store data for offline use” is selected. This 
prevents websites from planting a tracking code on your computer.
Now that you have finished configuring the basic settings of Firefox to make it more 
privacy-friendly, you need to move to the advanced settings to continue your work. 
Access the Firefox advanced settings page by typing about:config in the URL address 
bar of your browser. A warning message will appear; hit the button “I accept the risk!” to 
access the advanced settings panel.
To access a specific setting, you need to type its name in the Search box that appears 
at the top of the page. To begin, let’s change the first setting named browser.formfill.
enable to false (double-click to change the settings value). This forces Firefox to forget 
form information (see Figure 2-17).
CHapTer 2  INTrOduCTION TO ONlINe THreaTS aNd COuNTermeaSureS
63
Now, in the same way, you need to change the following settings:
• 
Change browser.cache.disk.enable to false.
• 
Change browser.cache.disk_cache_ssl to false.
• 
Change browser.cache.offline.enable to false.
• 
Change dom.event.clipboardevents.enabled to false.
• 
Change geo.enabled to false.
• 
Change network.cookie.lifetimePolicys value to 2.
• 
Change plugin.scan.plid.all to false.
These advanced configurations will “harden” Firefox and make it more difficult for 
outside parties to track your activities. In the next section, we will cover privacy add-ons 
that can further secure Firefox and fight against online tracking and user profiling.
 Firefox Privacy Extensions
A selection of the best Firefox extensions (see Table 2-6) that help you to maintain your 
online privacy will be mentioned here. Please note that some add-on providers may 
fool users and collect private data about browsing habits and even personal information 
without their consent, so it is advisable to avoid installing any add-on except the 
ones mentioned in this section. Also, if a new reliable add-on appears later (say after 
publishing this book), ensure that it comes from a reputable trusted developer and 
install it from https://addons.mozilla.org exclusively.

 Fighting Against Digital Fingerprinting and Browser Leak
We’ve already covered a good amount of information on how to make your web browser 
more resistant to fingerprinting. Despite all these techniques, we cannot guarantee a 100 
percent technical solution to stop this privacy invasion. The best solution is to access the 
Internet using a freshly installed of the Firefox browser. This will effectively make your 
browser look like most browsers’ fingerprint! To make things more hidden, install your 
web browser within a virtual machine. This will also conceal your current machine—
hardware and software—configurations. Of course, you still need to use a VPN to encrypt 
your connection and conceal your IP address.
 Secure Online Communication
In this section, we will show you how to use different techniques to conceal your real IP 
address and to make your connection encrypted so it is hard to intercept. Please note 
that the term privacy is different from anonymity, although they are interrelated in many 
ways. So, in this context, VPN and proxy servers will help to mask your traffic; outside 
observers will see that there is traffic originating from your computer, but they cannot

see what is passing (for example, ISPs and governments cannot see which websites you 
are visiting). In addition, all the websites you are visiting—and the applications you are 
using—will not see your real IP address. In anonymity, an outside observer should not 
be able to know the source of the connection; hence, they cannot attribute your online 
activities to you. Both privacy and anonymity are important for any OSINT analyst and 
should be fully understood before you begin your OSINT work in the rest of the book.
 VPN
A VPN allows a user to establish a secure connection from one site to another across the 
Internet (see Figure 2-18). It is widely used in corporations to access remote sites while 
assuring the confidentiality of sensitive data. The VPN also gives users anonymous IP 
addresses, making them appear as if in another location so they can avoid censorship, 
share files with other people privately, and more. Nowadays a VPN is a necessity for 
anyone who cares about their privacy when going online.
Figure 2-18. How a VPN works (source: www.DarknessGate.com)
VPN vendors offer varying features. You should care about the following features 
when selecting your VPN provider:
• 
Do not subscribe to VPN service providers that are based in one of 
the following countries: United States, United Kingdom, Australia, 
New Zealand, Canada, Denmark, France, Netherlands, Norway, 
CHapTer 2  INTrOduCTION TO ONlINe THreaTS aNd COuNTermeaSureS
66
Belgium, Germany, Italy, Spain, Israel, Sweden, and of course 
countries such as Russia, China, Iran, and all Arab states. The best 
providers are based in Switzerland and follow its jurisdiction.
• 
A VPN provider must have its own DNS server; it must also support 
DNS leak protection (more on this next).
• 
It is preferred that the VPN software support the OpenVPN software. 
This is an open source program that can be audited by anyone to 
assure it’s vacant from any backdoors.
• 
It should accept anonymous payments such as bitcoin, gift cards, 
debit cards, and cash.
• 
It is better to support multiple devices at the same time so you can protect 
your tablet and smartphone data in addition to your laptop or PC.
• 
It should not require many details to set up; a username and a 
password should be enough.
Note! If your ultimate purpose is anonymity and plausible deniability, use the Tor 
Browser instead of a VpN.
 Proxies
A proxy server is an intermediary computer that sits between your computing device 
and the Internet. Corporations use proxies to filter content and to offer a level of security 
by separating a corporate local network from the Internet. There are different kinds of 
proxies; the main type is the web proxy that most Internet users mean when using the 
term proxy. Its main function is to fetch online resources—whether it is a page or a file—
from the Internet and then send them to your computer. They also provide anonymity 
by changing the real IP address of the user’s computer into the IP address of the proxy 
server (see Figure 2-19).
CHapTer 2  INTrOduCTION TO ONlINe THreaTS aNd COuNTermeaSureS
67
Numerous free proxy servers are available online. However, we strongly recommend 
that such services are not used. A free proxy usually shows advertisements in your 
browser, which may introduce malicious software or other tracking scripts that could 
infect or compromise your machine if you click a malicious link. In addition, most free 
proxies are not secure enough to trust to process and communicate your critical data, 
such as credit card details and account passwords.
 DNS Leak Test
Using a VPN—and other anonymity services—does not guarantee that your web 
browsing history will not get revealed. Sometimes even though you are protecting your 
connection using a VPN, a connection leak can occur and reveal the real IP address 
without you being aware. Such a leak occurs when part of your computing device traffic 
(DNS traffic) is not routed through the secure channel of the anonymity service you are 
using and hence the VPN. Instead, it gets directed to your ISP’s Internet servers (see 
Figure 2-20), allowing them to potentially monitor and log the complete web browsing 
history, even though you’re using a VPN.
Figure 2-19. How a proxy server works (source: www.GarknessGate.com)
CHapTer 2  INTrOduCTION TO ONlINe THreaTS aNd COuNTermeaSureS
68
To ensure that your VPN provider is not vulnerable to this risk, you are strongly 
advised to test your connection directly after connecting to your VPN provider, as 
follows:
 1. Go to https://www.dnsleaktest.com.
 2. You will see two buttons along with your current IP address. The 
first button is labeled “Standard test,” and the second is “Extended 
test.” Click the second button for detailed results.
 3. The detailed results page will show you a list of all the DNS 
servers (along with their locations) that are used to resolve your 
typed website URLs into IP addresses. If any of these servers 
are not related to your VPN provider company, this means your 
connection is leaking information about you.
Figure 2-20. How a DNS leak occurs (source: www.darknessgate.com)
CHapTer 2  INTrOduCTION TO ONlINe THreaTS aNd COuNTermeaSureS
69
Reputable VPN providers have a connection leak prevention mechanism. However, 
you need to make sure that your VPN provider has this feature enabled automatically for 
your connection.
Warning! always do dNS leak testing, as explained, to assure that your dNS 
traffic is tunneled through your VpN-encrypted tunnel and not through your ISp.
 Online Anonymity
When working online to collect OSINT sources, it is vital to remain completely 
anonymous. VPN allows you to mask your IP address and scramble the transferred 
contents to and from your PC. However, the VPN provider can intercept all your 
communications in plain sight. For mission-critical tasks, it highly advisable to use 
anonymous networks (e.g., Tor, I2P, and Freenet). This allows you to conceal your 
identity when surfing or publishing information online. In the following section, we will 
cover the Tor Network, which is considered the most used anonymous network today.
 Using the TOR Network
Tor is the most popular anonymous network currently used online; it is mainly 
composed of these two parts:
• 
The piece of software you run on your machine to access the Internet 
anonymously
• 
The Tor Network of volunteer computers that direct your online 
traffic
Tor enables users to achieve a high level of online anonymity by encrypting both the 
data and the destination IP addresses prior to sending them through a virtual circuit, 
which consists of many nodes (no fewer than three nodes at any given time). Each node 
then decrypts part of the data to reveal only the next node in the circuit to direct the 
remaining encrypted data to it. The next node performs the same function until the 
message reaches the final node, called the exit relay. The exit relay decrypts the data 
without revealing the source IP address, sending it on to its destination (see Figure 2-21).
CHapTer 2  INTrOduCTION TO ONlINe THreaTS aNd COuNTermeaSureS
70
Note! The term node is used to describe any server working as part of the Tor 
Network of relays. Sometimes people use different terms for the node such as 
server, relay, or router.
When using Tor to anonymize your location, it will use the exit relay IP address 
instead of your real IP address as the source IP address. This will effectively conceal your 
identity online.
To use the Tor Network to begin your OSINT searches, all you need to do is to 
download and use the Tor Browser.
 Tor Browser
To access the Tor Network, download the Tor Browser from | https://www.torproject.org/ 
projects/torbrowser.html.en. The Tor Browser is a security-hardened Firefox browser 
that requires no installation on the client machine; you can safely run it from your USB 
drive. It comes with the Tor software that allows you to access the Tor Network transparently 
upon launching this browser without any extra configuration (see Figure  2- 22).

Figure 2-22. Successful launch of the Tor Browser
Please note that only websites visited through the Tor Browser will get routed 
through the Tor Network anonymously; other browsers and applications already 
installed on your device will not use the Tor Network.
