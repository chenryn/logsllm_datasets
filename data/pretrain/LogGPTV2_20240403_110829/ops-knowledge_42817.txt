Question: Your team is reviewing the security of an application that generates temporary files. An audit reveals that temporary files are stored in a commonly accessible directory. What is the primary security risk associated with this practice, and what should be the main consideration for an alternative design?
"A": "The risk of file content interception and the main consideration should be encrypting the content of temporary files.",
"B": "The risk of denial-of-service attacks and the main consideration should be to implement rate-limiting on file creation.",
"C": "The risk of unintended actors determining the existence or accessing the files and the main consideration should be restricting directory permissions.",
"D": "The risk of file corruption and the main consideration should be to implement checksum verification for all temporary files."
Answer: C
