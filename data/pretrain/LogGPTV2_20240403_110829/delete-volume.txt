### Delete Volume

**Function:**
This command deletes the selected volume. Before proceeding, you must select a volume for the operation to succeed. Use the `select volume` command to choose and focus on a specific volume.

**Important Notes:**
- You cannot delete the system volume, boot volume, or any volume that contains the active paging file or crash dump (memory dump).

**Syntax:**
```plaintext
delete volume [noerr]
```

**Parameters:**
- **noerr**: (For scripting only) When an error is encountered, DiskPart continues to process commands as if the error did not occur. Without this parameter, an error will cause DiskPart to exit with an error code.

**Examples:**
To delete the volume with the current focus, type:
```plaintext
delete volume
```

**Steps:**
1. Select the volume you want to delete using the `select volume` command.
2. Execute the `delete volume` command to remove the selected volume.

**Additional Information:**
- Ensure that the volume you are deleting does not contain critical system files or data that you need.
- Always back up important data before performing operations that modify disk volumes.
