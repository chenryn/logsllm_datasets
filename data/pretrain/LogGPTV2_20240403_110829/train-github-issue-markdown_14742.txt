Hi, just reporting a problem,
I tried to run julia on Ubuntu 13.04 on a free EC2 instance (t1.micro) and got
an Illegal instruction just after typing julia.
I tried both 32 and 64 bit Ubuntu.  
Haven't tried this on a non-free instance.
Steps to reproduce:
  * create a t1.micro instance running the OS : Ubuntu server 13.04 (32 or 64 bits) ;
  * sudo apt-get install julia
  * execute 'julia'
  * "Illegal instruction (core dumped)"
