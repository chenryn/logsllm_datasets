## What is Intrusion Prevention?

### Network Security Perspective
- To a network security professional, it resembles a firewall.
  - **Messages (Packets)**
  - **Rules**

### Antivirus Perspective
- To an antivirus expert, it looks like an antivirus solution.
  - **Messages (File I/O)**
  - **Signatures**

### Combined Approach
- **Network-based:**
  - **Packets**
  - **Signatures**
- **Host-based:**
  - **API Calls**
  - **Signatures**

- **Personal Firewalls:**
  - Combine host and network-based filtering.

## How is Intrusion Prevention Different?
- **Signature-Based:**
  - Unlike traditional firewalls that use rules, intrusion prevention systems (IPS) use signatures.
  - These signatures are not the same as those used in Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS).
  - Signatures act as access controls.

- **Comparison with Other Tools:**
  - **SNORT/Hogwash:**
    - Signature-based firewall
    - Often referred to as "Gateway IDS" by IDS vendors
  - **Packets**
  - **Signatures**

## Why is Intrusion Prevention Important?
- **Encryption and Re-encoding:**
  - Encryption, fragmentation, and re-encoding can prevent application layer filtering on the wire.
  - Data and exploits reside in the clear at the application layer.

- **Application Layer Visibility:**
  - Provides better contextual discrimination.
  - Enables the system to stop certain types of exploits.

- **Complex Application State:**
  - Application state is complex and includes the state of memory, disk, and clients.
  - Traditional network security tools may not be sufficient.

---

## Intrusion Prevention Signatures
- **Application-Specific:**
  - Specific to the application state and system state.
  - Use contextual clues.
  - Block threats from within the system.

---

## How Does It Work?
- **Operating System Architecture:**
  - **Windows 2000:**
    - **User-Land Layers:**
      - Binary compatible app layer
      - OS-specific, native layer
    - **Kernel Layers:**
      - Executive services
      - Object Manager
      - Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)

  - **Linux:**
    - **Common Abstraction Layers:**
      - One common abstraction layer for the kernel.
      - One common abstraction layer for user-land.
    - **Contextual Information:**
      - Each layer provides context information.
      - Helps distinguish and filter based on API calls, system calls, and instruction levels.

---

## Architecture Comparison
- **Windows 2000 vs. Linux:**
  - Both architectures provide multiple layers for observation and control.
  - The fewer layers in Linux do not necessarily make it less secure.

---

## Exploit Prevention
- **Exploits:**
  - Often designed to evade IDS.
  - Cause exceptional behavior.
- **Approach:**
  - Instead of fixing IDS, take a different approach.
  - Focus on app state or behavior and payload behavior.

---

## Examples and Demonstrations
- **FreeBSD Example:**
  - **Background:**
    - Release date, authors, impact, and variations.
  - **Coverage:**
    - Firewall, antivirus, and IDS coverage.
  - **Successful Exploit Demo:**
    - Show how the exploit works.
  - **Code Excerpts:**
    - Vulnerability, injection, and payload.
  - **Prevention:**
    - Unique aspects of the payload and injection.
    - How to recognize and block them.
  - **Blocked Exploit Demo:**
    - Demonstrate the IPS in action.
  - **Contextual Information:**
    - Network identity, user identity, application state, authentication, and workflow.
