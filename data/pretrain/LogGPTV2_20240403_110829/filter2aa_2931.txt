- Reverse Engineer
- Experienced Capture the Flag (CTF) Player
- Expert in Advanced IDA Pro Techniques

---

**Introduction:**
- CPU emulators are valuable in various scenarios:
  - System design before hardware is available
  - Running code from obsolete platforms
  - Analyzing code without setting up full hardware
- Some emulators go beyond CPU emulation to simulate entire systems, including hardware.

---

**Goals:**
- Develop a lightweight CPU emulator for static reverse engineering.
- Temporarily switch from disassembly to confirm behavior.
- Integrate the results of computations back into static analysis.

---

**End Result: Sk3wlDbg**
- A lightweight emulator integrated into a disassembler.
  - Disassembler: IDA Pro
  - Emulator: Unicorn Engine

---

**IDA Pro:**
- A commercial disassembler supporting multiple processor families.
- Integrated debugger for x86 and ARM targets.
- Decompiler for 32/64-bit x86 and 32/64-bit ARM.

---

**Unicorn Engine:**
- Announced at BlackHat USA 2015 by the same team behind Capstone.
- Website: [Unicorn Engine](http://www.unicorn-engine.org/)
- Based on QEMU and supports x86, x86-64, ARM, ARM64, Sparc, MIPS, and M68k.
- Showcases: [Unicorn Showcase](http://www.unicorn-engine.org/showcase/)

---

**Other Notable Emulators:**
- **Bochs:**
  - "Bochs is a highly portable open-source IA-32 (x86) PC emulator written in C++."
  - Website: [Bochs](http://bochs.sourceforge.net/)
- **QEMU:**
  - "QEMU is a generic and open-source machine emulator and virtualizer."
  - Website: [QEMU](http://www.qemu.org)

---

**Emulators and IDA Pro:**
- **2003: ida-x86emu** - For deobfuscating x86 binaries.
- **2009: Hex-Rays adds Bochs "debugger" module.**
- **2014: msp430 for use with Microcorruption.**
  - Website: [Microcorruption](https://microcorruption.com)
- **2016: Unicorn integration** - Because why not?

---

**Rationale:**
- Initially considered QEMU and Bochs for ida-x86emu but found them too heavyweight.
- The Unicorn team did the heavy lifting, bringing more architectures to the table.

---

**Implementation: Two Choices:**
1. **Emulate over the IDA database itself using the database as backing memory:**
   - ida-x86emu does this.
   - Forces changes on the database with no undo option.
2. **Leverage the IDA plugin architecture to build a debugger module:**
   - IDA’s Bochs debugger module follows this approach.

---

**Result:**
- Many development hours and an unhappy wife.
- Mostly undocumented IDA plugin interface.
- Beta-quality emulator framework.
- **It’s Alive!**
  - Sub-classed IDA `debugger_t` for all supported Unicorn CPU types.
  - Simple ELF and PE loaders map files into Unicorn.
  - Fallback loader copies IDA sections into Unicorn.
- **Integration Issues:**
  - IDA remains a 32-bit executable.
  - Can only interface with 32-bit libraries.
  - Unicorn has limited support for 32-bit builds.
  - Unicorn's underlying QEMU code depends on glib, complicating use on Windows.

---

**Demo:**
- Alpha code, so bugs could be from Unicorn or my implementation.
- **Demos:**
  - Simple deobfuscation: ida-x86emu, Bochs, Sk3wlDbg.
  - Local ARM emulation on Windows.
  - Local MIPS emulation on Windows.
  - Scripted control of Sk3wlDbg to solve CTF challenges.

---

**Future Plans:**
- **Better User Interface:**
  - Specify where emulation should start.
  - Set initial register state.
- **Implementation of IDA’s appcall hook:**
  - Call functions in the binary from IdaPython scripts if they have prototypes.
- **Extensible Hooking:**
  - Implement hooks for library functions and system calls in IdaPython.
- **Option to Load Shared Libraries:**
  - Load shared libraries into the emulation along with the executable loaded in IDA.
