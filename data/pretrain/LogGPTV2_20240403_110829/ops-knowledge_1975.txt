User: Please describe the function and principle of the reverse proxy server, and give an introduction to a commonly used reverse proxy server.
Assistant: reverse proxy server refers to a server located between the internal network and the external network, and its role is to provide services to the internal network on behalf of the external network. The reverse proxy server receives user requests from the external network, forwards these requests to the corresponding server in the internal network, and then forwards the data returned by the server back to the user terminal. The role of the reverse proxy server is like a gatekeeper, which can control the access of external users to the internal network. The principle of the reverse proxy server is to direct external access requests to the reverse proxy server by configuring DNS resolution or URL redirection. When the user enters the URL in the browser, the request first reaches the reverse proxy server, and the proxy server will select the corresponding server to process the request and return the result according to the content of the request. Commonly used reverse proxy servers include Apache HTTP Server and Nginx. Apache HTTP Server is a commonly used open source web server software that supports functions such as reverse proxy and load balancing. Nginx is also an open source web server software, its design goal is high concurrency, high performance, high reliability, and can effectively handle a large number of concurrent requests. Compared with Apache HTTP Server, Nginx has better performance, so it is more suitable as a reverse proxy server.
