# Description of the new feature/enhancement
A **multiplexer** feature would be very useful and cool!  
By having multiple panes in a single windows:
  * You can easily copy/paste output from one pane to another.
  * You can work on multiple tasks at once.
  * You can monitor multiple commands at once.
  * You can compose a command in one pane while looking at the 'help' page for that command in another pane.
