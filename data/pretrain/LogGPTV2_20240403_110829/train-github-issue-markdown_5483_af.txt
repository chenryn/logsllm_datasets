**Note:** The data utilized in this context were generated using the `sch.linkage` function with the `distance_matrix_rows` as input. 

For clarity and completeness, it would be helpful to specify the parameters used within the `sch.linkage` function and provide a brief explanation of what `distance_matrix_rows` represents. For example:

**Note:** The data presented here were generated using the `sch.linkage` function from the SciPy library, with `distance_matrix_rows` as the input. `distance_matrix_rows` is a matrix that contains the pairwise distances between the rows of the original dataset. The specific linkage method (e.g., 'ward', 'single', 'complete') and any additional parameters should also be mentioned for full reproducibility.

This provides a more detailed and professional explanation.
