impractical for supporting data transfer, it can still be useful
for channel measurement at extremely low bitrates.
Let us again consider the case of a peripheral transmit-
ting to a central station via a polymorphic radio. In order
to measure the channel, a short training sequence of a few
bits can be transmitted, and the RSS estimated by obtaining
the correlation between the received signal and the training
sequence. Since the training sequence can be as short as a
few bits, the backscatter bitrate can be as low as a few kilo-
bits/second which can allow it to operate at longer distances
(e.g. 75 m @ 2.9 kbps [49]). Figure 2(b) illustrates this idea Ð
the grey line corresponding to backscatter RSS is below the
receive sensitivity when operating at 100 kbps but mostly
higher than the sensitivity when transmitting at 3 kbps.
The central benefit of being able to use backscatter for
channel measurement is enhanced visibility into the channel
at near-zero power consumption. The additional visibility
allows us to be more judicious about use of the active radio
in two ways: a) we can select the best bitrate for the active
radio even after a long sleep gap, and b) we can select the best
times to wakeup the active radio by choosing times when
the RSS is strongest. The figure shows these advantages Ð by
leveraging backscatter for channel visibility, we can choose
the best active bitrates (the line-segments) and the best times
for active transmission (the peaks).
We note that this approach does not directly translate to
the scenario where the peripheral is receiving data from the
central station. This is because an envelope detector does not
provide signal strength information, so cannot be used for
channel measurement. Therefore, we use passive-assisted
active solely for uplink transmission from the peripheral to
the central station.
4 MORPHO PHY LAYER
The main challenge at the PHY layer is how to seamlessly
integrate passive and active radio components so that they
can transparently switch between various modes without the
application perceiving the switching behavior. To accomplish
this, we design the Morpho hardware to enable rapid and
seamless switching.
Figure 3: The building blocks of Morpho hardware.
To illustrate the need for a new design, we start with a
strawman solution for an active-passive radio that simply
connects an active radio like BLE together with a passive
radio (e.g. WISP), and switches between these two as needed
(similar to BLISP [19]).
Such a design is inefficient due to the lack of configurabil-
ity. Virtually all radio ICs have the TX and RX components
tied together, and do not provide us the freedom to mix-and-
match different possibilities. For example, low-power active
radios like BLE turn on both the TX and RX components
when they switch on from sleep mode since they assume that
active-mode ACKs will follow the data packet. In addition,
most commercial radios incur setup delays upon receiving
a command, which makes it difficult to rapidly switch be-
tween the different modes. In contrast, our goal is to have
the freedom to rapidly switch between all four combinations
of passive rx/tx and active rx/tx.
4.1 Morpho Sensor Architecture
Morpho is designed for one-hop asymmetric settings where
the peripheral (e.g. IoT sensor or mobile accessory) is resource-
constrained whereas the central station (e.g. access point or
edge cloud) is resource-rich. We first describe the radio ar-
chitecture on the peripheral shown in Figure 3 (upper block).

recognition. Streaming 100 samples/second from a nine-axis IMU. Medium average throughput of
10 kbps.
Streaming audio from a lapel sensor for dialog-based applications. Streaming audio at 4 kHz. High

Same scenario as T2 but audio is streamed from the central device to peripheral (e.g. music).
Table 1: Description of experimental traces. In all cases, we assume that the data is streamed roughly sample-by-
sample with a low latency of 30ms. In each case, we collect simultaneous channel information in both passive
and active modes, allowing us to compare strategies.
7.1 Morpho prototype
One issue we encountered was that ultra-low power RF os-
cillators with tight sleep-active transition times were not
available as stand-alone components for PCB-level integra-
tion. Hence, we custom-designed a Collpitt LC oscillator and
integrated it with the backscatter radio (RF oscillator block
in Figure 3). The oscillator was first designed in ADS simula-
tion environment in order to tune its LC components as well
as the lengths of micro-strip tracks to the right frequency
and output power, then implemented on a PCB with an NXP
BFU690F NPN RF transistor [35]. The Collpitt oscillator that
we designed has an output power of +1.1 dBm and wakeup
time of 25-35 µs, and generates a 910MHz carrier.
For completeness, we also mention other components of
the design. We use a ADG902 SPST RF switch [3] is used
as backscatter switch, and HSMS-285C Schottky diodes [6]
are used in the envelope detectors. An ADEX-10L+ passive
mixer [31] is used for implementing higher order ASK modu-
lations to change the active bitrate as needed. Also, ADG919
SPDT RF switches [4] are used in order to multiplex between
the [Tx/Rx ⇄ antenna] paths and to switch between active
and passive modes. Finally, an ADP-2-10+ RF power split-
ter [32] is used to split the Tx and Rx paths to the antenna,
and we use a W1910 1dBi small whip antenna [40] as our
antenna for Morpho prototype.
On the digital side, the packetizer, MAC layer controller,
and the low bit rate sequence generator used for measure-
ment is implemented externally on a AGLN250 low power
FPGA development board [30], which connects to the proto-
type via the connectors shown in Figure 8.
7.2 Base station implementation
Our base-station is built based on a X300 USRP [13] operat-
ing at +30 dBm carrier. Since the base-station must be able
to work in both backscatter and active modes, we use an
ADG902 evaluation board [3] to turn on and off the carrier.
The entire decision engine and data decoding stack is im-
plemented inside a Mac mini computer that is connected to
the USRP and to the ADG902 switch. The UBX-40 daughter
board has -100 dBm noise level for 1 MHz bandwidth.
On the software side, we run our switching and control
tasks in MATLAB, and transfer raw IQ samples from USRP
to the MATLAB environment using a TCP socket. There is a
200 µs-300 µs latency in the connection, which has a small
effect on overall performance. Within MATLAB, we imple-
mented several software modules including backscatter RSSI
measurement, active RSSI measurement, ASK demodulation,
data imputation, and prediction engine.
8 EVALUATION
Our evaluation uses a combination of trace-driven evalua-
tion and real experiments. Since we need to compare many
different communication strategies on the same underlying
channel dynamics, our benchmark and comparison results
are evaluated on traces where we simultaneously collected
data from the active and passive radios. The application stud-
ies are based on a live implementation.
8.1 Hardware micro-benchmarks
We start with hardware micro-benchmarks before showing
overall performance results. Table 2 benchmarks the per-
formance of Morpho at the hardware level. The most im-
portant optimization is the ability to switch within tens of
microseconds between passive and active modes allowing
us to respond swiftly to channel dynamics. The result also
shows that we operate at extremely low power levels while
measuring the channel via backscatter. We also see that our
Colpitt oscillator performs efficiently at output power levels
typically used by low-power radios.
The table also shows the benefits of using both a high-
rate but short-range detector and a long-range but low-rate
detector. The fast detector supports good bitrates of 32 kbps
to 128 kbps but can only operate at high RSS levels of roughly
454

Benefits of predicting active channel: We now look
at the benefit of our prediction scheme against a baseline
method that assumes that the RSS for the current slot is the
same as the RSS for the previous slot. Table 4 shows that our
prediction method improves energy efficiency of Morpho by
roughly two times over the naïve prediction method which
cannot deal with a dynamic channel.
8.3 Application-layer Performance
We now consider two applications that leverage Morpho and
evaluate how the radio can improve their performance. The
results in this section are based on a full hardware-software
integration to enable live experimentation.
Eye tracking: Here, we illustrate the benefits of Morpho
for an eye tracker whose sampling decisions are varied based
on the current power consumed by the radio. We integrated
Morpho with an eye tracker as shown in Figure 13.
While a complete description of the eye tracking mecha-
nism and hardware can be found in [28], we describe salient
details to understand the results. Briefly, the eye tracker is
able to sample the imager at different resolutions and ex-
tract user gaze location by running neural network models
trained for different sampling patterns. Clearly, accuracy
depends on the sampling resolution and varies from a gaze
error of 10Ð15 pixels at 77 pixels/frame to 0Ð3 pixels at 1984
pixels/frame, where error is the euclidean distance between
actual and predicted gaze location.
For this evaluation, we assume that the eye tracker device
has a fixed power budget of 100µW for every gaze location

update (at 30Hz frame rate). The tracker adjusts the sampling
rate depending on available budget Ð when communication
costs more, it samples less and vice-versa. We follow the
same procedure that we used to collect the traces in Table 1
i.e. we move around a room in a scripted manner with the
main difference being that we were running a live version
of the eye tracker.
Table 5 shows that Morpho reduces gaze error by about 3×
over an active-only approach and 4ś5× over a backscatter-
only approach (both at short distance and across all dis-
tances). The improvements occur because Morpho is able
to use energy saved in communication on sensing, thereby
transmitting more samples and improving accuracy.

Table 6: Audio voice quality over Morpho versus duty-
cycled active and backscatter-only.
Voice audio streaming: We now look at streaming voice
audio over Morpho (upload from peripheral to central sta-
tion). For this experiment, we attached Morpho to a shirt
(convenient location for microphone) and transmitted a stored
audio stream via the different modes. We use typical audio
streaming parameters (40kbps rate, 125 byte audio packets,
and 30ms latency). We followed the same procedure as the
eye tracking example in terms of moving across different
locations in the room while the data was being transmitted.
We then computed the Mean Opinion Score (MOS) of the
audio stream [41].
Table 6 shows that MOS score is marginally lower than for
the active radio (primarily because of bit rate changes when
switching between active and passive modes) but energy
efficiency is four times higher across all distances and an
order of magnitude higher at short distance. Backscatter has
considerably lower MOS score but it has very high energy-
efficiency. Thus, Morpho is able to take advantage of the
channel to improve energy efficiency without significant
