**Current behavior**
`AbstractControl.get` allows a flexible `path` parameter, for specifying the
required descendent `AbstractControl` to return.
**Expected behavior**
`AbstractControl.getChild(key: keyof T)` would allow additional type
safety, in the case where the required `AbstractControl` is a direct child of
the instance `AbstractControl`-derived parent.
_Here,`T` refers to the type of the data model, i.e. the type of
`AbstractControl.value`._
_In fact, this method is probably only suitable for`FormGroup`._
Further, the following signature:  
`AbstractControl.getChild(key: keyof T): C |
null`  
would allow the caller to indicate the expected sub-type of `AbstractControl`
to be returned.
**Minimal reproduction of the problem with instructions**
**What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**
Reduce the risk of typos in the string value passed to the proposed `getChild`
method.
