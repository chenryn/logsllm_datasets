In the 1.5.2 (or 1.5.1) branch, the file `src/atomics.h` is missing a template keyword for `jl_atomic_store_release` around line 269, which makes the file uncompilable in Visual Studio 2017. Specifically, the issue can be found in the following line:

```cpp
static inline void jl_atomic_store_relaxed(volatile T *obj, T2 val)
```

This problem occurs when compiling the code from the Julia documentation on high-level embedding for Windows with Visual Studio, available at:
[Julia High-Level Embedding on Windows with Visual Studio](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/embedding/#High-Level-Embedding-on-Windows-with-Visual-Studio).

The necessary change to address this issue was introduced in commit `2b510b4` on the master branch. However, this commit, which seems to be part of a different feature, has not been backported to the 1.5.2 branch.

To resolve the compilation error, you may need to manually add the missing template keyword or consider using a more recent version of Julia that includes the fix.
