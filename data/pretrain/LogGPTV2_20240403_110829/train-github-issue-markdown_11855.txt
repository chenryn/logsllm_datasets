On the 1.5.2 branch (or 1.5.1), the file src/atomics.h is missing a template
keyword for jl_atomic_store_release , around line 269, making the file
uncompilable (in VS2017). See
julia/src/atomics.h
Line 269 in 539f3ce
|  static inline void jl_atomic_store_relaxed(volatile T *obj, T2 val)  
---|---  
.
This is compiling the code at
https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/embedding/#High-Level-Embedding-on-
Windows-with-Visual-Studio .
This change is made in commit `2b510b4` on master, which appears to be working
on a different feature, but that commit is not in 1.5.2 .
