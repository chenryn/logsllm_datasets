or deliberately deviate from standard transactions. Except
for nulldata transactions (introduced in 2013), all content
storage methods begin to spread in mid 2011, roughly six
months after Bitcoin had started to be used eﬀectively [5].
Besides a timestamped message engraved into Bitcoin’s
ﬁrst block, ﬁrst content was added using P2PKH transactions.
The ﬁrst such message, created on May 13, 2011, already
shows the possibility to add ﬁles to the blockchain. The
Bitcoin logo has been stored in two transactions [11], at the
expense of 0.02 BTC, then worth $0.16 (now $10.30).
Our dataset of content-holding transactions contains 7 561
P2PK(H) and multisig transactions consisting of printable
characters, holding text data of a total size of 1.86 MB. In
future work, we plan to extend our analysis to also capture the
more complex case of binary data being stored the blockchain,
as done by services such as Apertus2, as we expect such ﬁles
to have a more impact on Bitcoin’s blockchain.
As of version 0.9.0, released in June 2013, the reference
client added nulldata transactions as a standard transaction
type to store data on the blockchain. They were introduced to
reduce the overhead of data-holding transactions as Bitcoin
nodes actively keep track of unspent transactions. Since then,
the usage of nulldata transactions experienced exponential
growth, leading to a total of 936 174 nulldata transactions
until end of July 2016. This growth is partly due to services3
that link transactions to real-world assets via the Open
Asset protocol.
In total, 9.8% of all non-empty nulldata
transactions can be attributed to a service using Open Assets.
Apart from the initial message, coinbase transactions
started to contain data in the form of spiritual verses from
August 5, 2011. The ﬁrst advertisement was posted shortly
after on August 25. Today, coinbase transactions often ad-
vertise the network (mining pool) that created the respective
block. From January 2012 on, miners unoﬃcially (cf. Sec-
tion 2) voted on supporting Pay-to-Script transactions using
coinbase transactions.
Surprisingly, we found a total of 288 716 non-standard
transactions in the blockchain. However, the vast majority of
288 561 (99.9%) transactions consists of nulldata transactions
with empty payload. Only 132 non-standard transactions do
not use a standard script template. One of these transactions
from August 2013 encodes a 1.45 KB patch for the reference
client submitted by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2010.
We conclude that content is actively being stored on the
blockchain. Notably, P2PK(H) transactions are still abused
for storing content even though nulldata transactions serve

amounts of data. We expect to obtain even more insights by
attempting to detect binary ﬁles as well.
4. CLASSIFICATION OF CONTENT
So far, the Bitcoin community focused on identifying iso-
lated examples of data stored on the blockchain [11]. Instead,
we aim to quantify the properties of blockchain content and
present preliminary results in the remainder of this paper.
We analyze those transactions mentioned in Section 3
that can be feasibly used to add larger amounts of data
to the blockchain by arbitrary users in a timely manner,
i.e., we exclude coinbase transactions from our analysis. In
total, 940 354 (0.64% of the total) transactions matched
this category. Of these, 99.6% are nulldata transactions
of which 9.8% use the Open Assets protocol. A random
manual inspection revealed attempted double spends, tweet-
like short text messages, notary messages4, and a large set of
nulldata transactions that were not immediately attributable
to a certain service. However, the manual inspection also
revealed potentially critical and illegal content such as code
segments, a leaked ﬁrmware private key, and the illegal
prime number encoding a decryption algorithm for DVDs.
In addition, we found 90 encrypted ﬁles and excerpts from
the Tor Hidden Wiki containing links to indecent services
(e.g., illegal pornography). Recall that every honest user
unknowingly stores a copy of these contents, potentially
exposing them to, e.g., prosecution.
Motivated by these insights, we searched our dataset for
URLs as indicated by the keyword “http” as well as links
to Tor hidden services as indicated by the “.onion” suﬃx.
We observed 11 862 content-holding transactions containing
URLs, which account for 1.3% of all transactions in the con-
sidered dataset. The majority of these transactions (11 659)
used the nulldata, 193 the P2PK(H), 8 the multisig, and 2
non-standard storage methods. Here, messages from Open-
Asset-based services account for 3/4 of the links stored via
nulldata transactions. The two non-standard transactions
contain a JavaScript cross-site-scripting detector. Only the
two transactions holding the Tor Hidden Wiki page dump
contain links to content that must be considered illegal or at
least highly questionable based on their descriptions. How-
ever, these two transactions contain almost 400 links. Such
content may render downloading the blockchain illegal in
certain jurisdictions [8], especially since images and PDF
ﬁles have already been stored on the blockchain directly [11].
5. DISCUSSION
We showed that ≥0.80% of the transactions in Bitcoin’s
blockchain contain arbitrary content. While censorship-
resistant content stores may be desirable in some cases, our
analysis shows that this (ab)use puts Bitcoin at risk as a
currency. This harm stems from the fact that (i) users must
locally replicate the blockchain and ii) undesired content
can never be removed. While most of the identiﬁed content
appears to be included by honest services, the blockchain
already contains arguably problematic content such as illegal
code or links to illegal material. Moreover, illegal content
could deliberately be injected to render using the blockchain
(and thus using Bitcoin) illegal in certain jurisdictions [8],
aﬀecting even honest users. We therefore posit that a deeper
4e.g., https://docproof.org/ or https://bitproof.io/
understanding of the embedded content and methods pre-
venting such content from being uploaded is necessary.
Towards this, future work involves gaining a deeper under-
standing of how content is injected and to broadly analyze
blockchain content. This involves the content we already
found as well as searching for additional content. Most im-
portantly, we strive to address the more complex problem of
broadly identifying and characterizing binary data, which is
known from examples to exist in the blockchain. Furthermore,
we plan to widen our analysis to other public blockchains
and investigate the economical impacts of storing content
on the blockchains of cryptographic currencies. Finally, we
seek to develop countermeasures against the uncontrolled
inclusion of data into these blockchains.
