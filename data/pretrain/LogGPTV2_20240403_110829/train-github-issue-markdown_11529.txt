  * Operating system: Debian 9
  * CUPS: 2.2.1
Hey,
In my project I'm using printer Custom VKP80 in which 80mm thermal paper is
used.  
I'm running my electron application on Debian 9. The printer is added in cups
and configured to use 80mm paper. Also the printer is marked as default
printer.  
According to application logic printing should be performed silently. So I'm
using option {silent:true}. But with this option Electron (or Chromium inside
Electron) does not use configured cups settings and prints only part of html
document. Printed receipt looks like only left part of "virtual" A4 paper
(like 80mm from left side of A4 is printed).  
If set {silent:false} and NOT touch any settings in printing dialog and just
press "Print" button then printed receipt looks like expected, i.e. cups
settings are used.
### Expected behavior
Electron uses printer settings during printing with option {silent:true}
### Actual behavior
Electron does not use cups settings during printing with option {silent:true}
### How to reproduce
  1. Configure some non-standard printer in linux using cups.
  2. Call someWindow.webContents.print({silent:true})
