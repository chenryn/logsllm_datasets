key derivation security guarantees. Thus, using FMK D provides
an Enhanced Megamos Crypto as described in the above fixes. The
Enhanced Megamos Crypto theorem is provided in Appendix F.
7.2 Hitag-AES/Pro
The Hitag-AES/Pro [31] is a smart vehicle immobilizer transpon-
der based on AES 128-bit encryption algorithm. We extract the
authentication protocol in Hitag-AES/Pro as depicted in Figure 4. It
is meant to provide mutual authentication during communication

ations: auth − authentication request, nR, nT − random
nonces, k − pre-established shared secret key, PW DB − re-
sponder password.
between a reader and a transponder using a pre-established shared
secret key. We model the initiator (i.e., the reader) and responder
(i.e., the transponder in a car key) in a similar way to the Megamos
Crypto, except that we have two machines MA(H P) and MB(H B)
modelling the initiator and responder, respectively, of the Hitag-
AES/Pro. At the end of the execution of this protocol, the instances
exchange messages to authenticate each other in an ideal manner.
While Hitag-AES/Pro is widely used in the automotive industry, im-
plementing AES 128-bit encryption algorithm does not guarantee
relay resilience as a relay attack can still be performed irrespective
of the cryptographic algorithms deployed. Thus, Hitag-AES/Pro
does not realize FMK D. To show this: we consider a setting where
the honest initiator decrypts the fourth message m of the protocol,
i.e., Deck(m) = Deck(Enck(nR , PW DB)), received from the honest
responder as per Figure 4. If m was sent or not sent by the responder,
the initiator will still decrypt the message and act according to the
protocol execution because the Enck(.)/Deck(.) do not guarantee
any relay resilience and we have no relay resilience guarantee for
Enck(.), Deck(.), and m. Similar to the Megamos Crypto, this is not
a direct attack on the protocol but rather shows that the security of
Enc(.)/Dec(.) is not sufficient to prove that a protocol is resilience
against a relay attack.
A fix for this problem in our setting is to have a cryptographic
proof during Enck(.) and verify the proof during Deck(.) using
ComP&E and VerP/ValT commands of FCC, respectively, and then
use VerETimeMKD operation of FMK D to validate the expected
time of completing the protocol execution. This allows the en-
hancement of the protocol using FMK D which yields an Enhanced
Hitag-AES/Pro. Other commands of FMK D and FCC can also be used
in the protocol. This Enhanced Hitag-AES/Pro theorem is provided
in Appendix G.
8 RELATED WORK
The role of relay attacks in exploits against cryptographic protocols
in smart vehicles has been widely recognized with the practical
implementation of the attacks in [14, 34, 36]. We adopt the practical
implementation in [36] and then focus on proving relay security as
a form of relay resilience solution and enhancement to the existing
related work. Verdult et al. [35] discussed effective authentication
protocol for mitigating relay attacks. The protocol relies on the
AES 128-bit encryption algorithm, which is already implemented

in ATA5795C and Hitag-AES/Pro. However, the AES 128-bit en-
cryption algorithm does not solve the problem of relay attacks as
encrypted data can be relayed without decrypting it, i.e., relay at-
tacks are independent of the cipher used in designing the protocol.
Similarly, using authentication for relay resilience is frequently
discussed in [25, 26, 39] and poor implementation of authentication
protocols can expose the applications to relay attack due to imple-
mentation errors such as lack of key update and randomization
during authentication.
attacker. Ahmad et al. [2] presented a secure passive keyless en-
try and start method using machine learning. While the method
supports the detection of relay attacks in a challenge-response set-
ting between a key fob and a vehicle, it does not support mutual
authentication between the devices, i.e., the key fob and the vehicle.
We note that it is very important to apply mutual authentication
between the devices to mitigate authentication evasion. Wang et
al. [37] proposed a context-based secure keyless entry system that
supports communication over Bluetooth between the key fob and
vehicle. The system grants access to the vehicle via a connection
established between the key fob and the vehicle using information
extracted from the surrounding environment. At the end of the
connection establishment, the vehicle generates a signature for the
key fob. However, the system relies on public and private keys
issued by either an authority or another device for generating the
signature thereby presenting a single point of failure and intro-
ducing extra communication and computational overheads. Thus,
the system does not support key derivation for signature between
the key fob and vehicle. Choi et al. [8] proposed a sound-based
proximity-detection method for relay attack mitigation on PKES
systems. However, the method presents a single point of failure to
the systems because of the reliance on a preshared key to perform
authentication between the key fob and vehicle. Besides, such a
reliance makes the implementation of the method very difficult and
expensive in real-world environments.
In this paper, we argue that mutual authentication and key deriva-
tion are required to verify user identity and derive a shared secret
session key, respectively. Besides, mutual authentication is applied
to prevent an attacker from interfering with the transmitted mes-
sages between two users. Our framework, which is built irrespective
of hardware compatibility, uses the combination of cryptographic
operations, knowledge of the computation time of the operations,
and cryptographic timestamps to mitigate relay attacks based on
universal composability. While many of the above existing solu-
tions did not prove relay security of their work, mitigation solutions,
or countermeasures to guarantee that negotiable values, keys, or
proofs are resilience against relay attack [35, 36], we prove relay
protection for smart vehicles. Our result allows proving relay secu-
rity as long as we restrict the smart vehicles to our cryptographic
operations, knowledge of the computation time of the operations,
and cryptographic timestamps. Our framework provides a strong
form of relay security for users of smart vehicles. Two users that
authenticate each other and derive a shared secret session key in
our framework can obtain strong relay resilience guarantees.
9 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, we put forward a universally composable framework,
Crypto-Chain, to analyze relay security of many real-world proto-
cols in smart vehicles and provide relay resilience solution with the
support of an extended Kusters’s universal composition theorem
on a fixed number of protocol systems. Crypto-Chain consists of
an ideal crypto-chain functionality FCC for cryptographic opera-
tions and an ideal functionality for mutual authentication and key
derivation FMK D. FCC models various cryptographic primitives,
including our new DMA and KKE. These primitives can be com-
bined and used to negotiate a shared secret session key for relay
Verdult et al. [36] proposed some measures to mitigate relay
attacks. These measures include randomly generating secret keys,
redesigning weak ciphers, and using immobilizers that implement
AES 128-bit encryption algorithm. Relay attacks can still be per-
formed in the presence of secret keys and AES 128-bit encryption
algorithm because they do not depend on manipulation or interpre-
tation of plaintexts or ciphertexts. One of the key countermeasures
presented in [36] to mitigate relay attacks is implementing asym-
metric cryptography for data authentication. However, authenti-
cation alone is not sufficient to mitigate a relay attack. Wan et al.
[38] proposed to use key derivation schemes for car appliances to
provide relay resilience and prevent the use of vehicles without
permission. Key derivation countermeasures against relay attacks
can inadvertently increase attack vectors. For instance, derived keys
that rely on pre-established secret keys and weak cryptographic
primitives introduce weak keys flaw to the car appliances.
Francillon et al. number[14] proposed mitigation measures to
prevent relay attacks on passive keyless entry and start (PKES)
systems in smart cars. These measures include shielding the key
in the key case, removing the battery from the key, access control
restrictions, temporary disabling of the PKES systems via software
modification, and removing the battery from the key fob via hard-
ware modification. Overall, their solution relies on RF distance
bounding, which has been extensively studied in [19, 20] to provide
accurate measurement of distance for relay attack prevention. How-
ever, the solution affects the availability of the PKES systems as the
operation of the systems is disabled to execute countermeasures,
and the solution lacks cryptographic soundness to implement all
the basic relay resilience security properties such as authentication.
Note that a number of distance bounding protocols have been pro-
posed to mitigate relay attacks [17, 30]. However, these protocols
are vulnerable to distance hijacking attack [11]. To protect against
distance hijacking, the protocols are encouraged to use different
incompatible hardware for distance measurement. While this pro-
tection measure is applicable in the real world, the dispersed and
fast-changing nature of smart vehicles’ environments with many
different and similar hardware that can communicate with each
other makes it difficult for its extensive real-world deployment.
Li et al. [27] proposed a smartphone-enabled user context de-
tection system for relay attack mitigation. The system relies on
the direction assumption that a vehicle owner is either walking
towards the vehicle or is inside the vehicle to mitigate relay attacks.
Considering that relay attacks can be carried out irrespective of
the walking direction or position of the vehicle owner, this shows
that the system is unable to mitigate relay attacks when the vehi-
cle receives a start instruction from other directions. In this case,
the authentication mechanism of the system can be evaded by an

resilience support. FMK D is supported by FCC’s cryptographic op-
erations, knowledge of the computation time of the cryptographic
operations, and cryptographic timestamps.
We have provided a mutual authentication and key derivation
protocol MKD to further validate the beneficial use of Crypto-
Chain for the design of relay resilience cryptographic protocols in
the smart vehicles. We have implemented MKD and validated its
performance and relay resilience capabilities. We further demon-
strated the usefulness of Crypto-Chain in two case studies, namely
Megamos Crypto and Hitag-AES/Pro. We have uncovered some
weaknesses in the relay security of the protocols and used Crypto-
Chain to provide relay resilience by enhancing the security of the
protocols. In future work, we will apply Crypto-Chain to other
real-world protocols and extend it to further mitigate ransomware
attacks in smart vehicles.
