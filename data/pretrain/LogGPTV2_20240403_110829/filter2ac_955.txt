To enhance email security and prevent spoofing, implement anti-spoofing and email authentication mechanisms. These include:

- **Sender Policy Framework (SPF):** Verify the sender's domain by checking if the sending mail server is authorized to send emails on behalf of that domain.
- **DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM):** Ensure the integrity of messages by verifying that the email content has not been altered in transit.

By enabling these mechanisms within your organization through policies such as Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC), you can help both internal and external recipients perform similar message filtering and validation. Additionally, consider enforcing or installing browser extensions that protect against Internationalized Domain Name (IDN) and homograph attacks to further enhance security.
