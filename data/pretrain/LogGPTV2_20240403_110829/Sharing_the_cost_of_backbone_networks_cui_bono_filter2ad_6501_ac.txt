traﬃc volumes of the customers and their arriving orders.
From a fairness point of view, the Aggregate-Peak-device
policy is the absolute measure of fairness when the customer
liability is proportional to the aggregate peak of devices
(Section 3.3). Otherwise, the liability of the triggered net-
work upgrade should be considered. The Shapley policy lies
in between the two extreme policies because: a) unlike Trig-
ger, it does not allocate the cost only to the late-comers but
to the previous customers as well by considering all possible
orders of arrivals; and b) unlike Aggregate-Peak-Device, it
does not consider only the time instance of the peak utiliza-
tion.
We postpone the analysis of the cost sharing policies’ ac-
curacy to Section 5 where we present a thorough investi-
gation of the policies based on dataset-driven evaluations.
Our comparative study has the following structure. We ﬁrst
compare the Aggregate-Peak-Device policy with other more
practical, albeit less accurate policies. Then, we compare
the Aggregate-Peak-Device policy with the Shapley policy
and comment on how much error is introduced ignoring the
local peaks.
4. DATASETS
We use several datasets from a tier-1 backbone network,
which interconnects with other ISPs that it serves. In our
dataset, the network consists of 26 Points of Presence (PoPs)
and each customer connects to the network at one or more
PoPs through one or more interfaces. Overall there are 590
ingress links, and each ingress link is used by exactly one
customer. Internally, the backbone has 71 routers and 691
links, which are typically used by more than one customer.
We collected detailed NetFlow-based statistics for each of
the internal and ingress links including the traﬃc volumes
to and from each customer on every link in the network.
Such information allows us to assess which customer uses
which component in the shared infrastructure and how it
aﬀects the load on each component.
The per-link and per-customer traﬃc statistics cover the
period from 18 March 2012 to 10 April 2012, with a 2-
hour granularity (i.e., reporting volumes sent and received
within 2 hours). We have two additional datasets contain-
Figure 3: Illustrative example for L-discrepancies
of the customers on particular devices (e.g., cl
i) or on the
aggregate (e.g.,&l∈L cl
3.4 TCO-discrepancies
i).
The ﬁnal class of discrepancies is related to the Total Cost
of Ownership (TCO) of diﬀerent devices of the network.
Due to the heterogeneous nature of the network—caused by
the geographic and technological diﬀerences of its parts—
the same traﬃc patterns imply diverse expenditures for the
backbone operator on diﬀerent devices. Therefore, addi-
tional discrepancies occur when we consider the TCO of the
network in more detail. The following levels of TCO impact
the costs and the discrepancies of the customers:
• Pieces of costs. Even if the capacity of two partic-
ular equipment are equal, their costs can vary signiﬁ-
cantly due to technology diﬀerences (newer vs. older
generation), location (cost of shipping), diﬀerences in
purchase price, etc..
• Point-of-Presence (PoP) costs.
The backbone
network operator deals with diverse costs at each geo-
graphic location where it has a presence. The causes
behind the varying costs include but are not limited to
the following factors: energy (e.g., the energy price in
Germany can be twice as much as in the UK), facil-
ity costs (e.g., the rental cost of oﬃce space in Hong
Kong can be four times higher than in Germany [9]),
taxation, and personnel costs.
Contrary to the former types of discrepancies, in the case
of the TCO only network-level discrepancies exist. At the
network level, where we summarize the costs of the cus-
tomers across all the devices, additional discrepancies ap-
pear due to the diverse costs of the equipments.
Formally, we deﬁne the network-level TCO-discrepancy of
customer i as
(14)

where the ﬁrst term considers the diverse costs of the devices
contrary to the second. el
i denotes the cost of customer i in
case of device l assuming uniform cost across all the devices
(el = e∗,∀l ∈ L).
Illustrative example:
If we consider the traﬃc pattern
of the customers in Fig. 1 but we assume that the cost of the
investigated device is ﬁve times more than before, e.g. it is lo-
cated in a developing country, the costs of the customers also
increase by a factor of 5. Accordingly, the TCO-discrepancy
is 5 in the case of all the customers.
514ing time-series with a 5-min and 30-min granularity for one
day and one week, respectively. The traﬃc aggregated over
all ingress links peaks at around 1.35 T bps in both inbound
and outbound directions. Thus, without loss of generality,
we utilize the time-series of the customers’ incoming traﬃc.
The cost of a network link depends on the one hand on the
capacity of the interface, i.e., how much traﬃc it is capable
of forwarding. On the other hand, the geographic location
and the applied technology have an impact as well. Hard-
ware costs, energy prices, deployment costs, and taxation,
among others, contribute to the cost of a network device.
Thereby, it is challenging to accurately quantify the cost of
every single device.
To estimate the cost of the network links, we use the
wholesale point-to-point transport price database of Tele-
Geography [29]. We stress that these are the prices of whole-
sale physical layer circuits, however, do not diﬀer substan-
tially from the actual cost of ownership. In our empirical
analysis, we apply the prices of network links with diﬀerent
bandwidth, ranging from E-1 (2 Mbps) throughout STM-4
(622 Mbps) and 2.5G waves to 40G waves (40000 Mbps).
The costs of these links deﬁne a step function for the net-
work expenditures. Exact values can be provided to inter-
ested parties if conﬁdentiality requirements are met. As
future work, we intend to extend our analysis using more
detailed expenditure datasets that contains information on
the OPEX costs related to for example power supply, host-
ing centers, etc..
5. DATA-DRIVEN EVALUATION
In this section we use the datasets introduced in Section 4
to evaluate the various discrepancies discussed in Section 3.
In case of the F-, M-, and L-discrepancies, we use a uniform
cost function for the network devices to focus on the speciﬁc
properties of cost-sharing.
5.1 F-discrepancies
We start by looking at the eﬀect of the function applied
to the traﬃc of a customer.
5.1.1 Device-level F-discrepancies
To showcase the intricacies of F-discrepancies we start
with an example based on a backbone link between two
major PoPs in Europe. The monthly cost of this link is
$2163. In Fig. 4 we plot the amount of this cost attributed
to each one of the 10 largest customers according to the four
diﬀerent policies detailed in Section 3.1. The F-discrepancy,
i.e., the ratio of the cost computed by the Aggregate-
Peak-Device policy and the cost computed by the simpler
policy X∈ [Volume-Customer,
95Percentile-Customer,
Peak-Customer] is as high as 2.36 for customer 4 in this
example. This particular customer impacts the aggregate
peak of the device disproportionally more than the other
customers when we focus on the traﬃc volumes of the
customers. For several other customers the F-discrepancies
are much milder, i.e., the diﬀerent cost-sharing policies are
more or less in agreement.
We now look at F-discrepancies across all customers
and all links in our dataset.
In Fig. 5, we plot the the
F-discrepancies for the three simpler policies and we
summarize the main statistics in Table 1. The results show
generally high F-discrepancies. For example, 60% of the
customers are assigned 25% higher or lower cost than the

PoPs.

real one they inﬂict according to Aggregate-Peak-Device.
F-discrepancies are particularly high for Volume-Customer
and smaller for Peak-Customer and 95Percentile-Customer.
The last two policies are sensitive to peaks, albeit those
of particular customers instead of peaks of the aggregate
traﬃc on the device. Volume-Customer is even less accurate
since it is not looking at any peaks, but only at aggregate
volume over a longer time scale.
One may expect that there is a strong correlation between
the traﬃc volumes and the discrepancies of the policies. For
example, the other policies may always overestimate the cost
of customers, compared to the Aggregate-Peak-Device, if
the customers inject a large amount of traﬃc. However, our
results refute this as we illustrate in Fig. 6, where we present
the F-discrepancies as a function of the traﬃc volumes.
To illustrate the diﬀerences between the policies, Fig. 7
depicts a portion of the time-series of a link where a large F-
discrepancy (3.07) exists between the Volume-Customer and
the Aggregate-Peak-Device policies. The ﬁgure shows the
traﬃc pattern of the customer with the large F-discrepancy
and the aggregate traﬃc pattern of the other customers. The
traﬃc of the customer is marginal compared to the traﬃc
of the others, yielding a very low Volume-Customer cost.
However during the peak, the customer with the large dis-
crepancy contributes a signiﬁcant portion to the aggregate
traﬃc, thereby inducing a 3.07 times higher Aggregate-Peak-
Device than Volume-Customer cost.
Summary and implications: In the case of device-level
discrepancies, numerous and substantial F-discrepancies ex-
ist. This implies that backbone operators should apply the
Aggregate-Peak-Device policy for computing the costs in
case of a single device instead of the simpler policies.

The axes are logarithmically scaled.
5.1.2 Network-level F-discrepancies
We now examine F-discrepancies in the context of the
entire network. We do this by summing the costs of a cus-
tomer over all the network’s devices. We present the rela-
tive aggregate costs of the 10 largest customers in Fig. 8;
we consider the largest cost as the baseline. We present the
F-discrepancies of the policies in Table 2. The results reveal
that F-discrepancies at the network-level are much smaller
than at the device-level. For example, the network-level
median F-discrepancies are ∼40% less than the device-level
ones. This is because in large networks positive and neg-
ative cost diﬀerences at each device cancel each other out,
thus the cost predictions of the simpler policies become more
aligned.
Summary and implications: F-discrepancies although
important for individual links or small networks tend to
become less signiﬁcant for larger networks. Thus, backbone
operators can use simpler policies than the Aggregate-
Peak-Device without running a high risk of miscalculating
the costs of the customers if they are just interested in the
aggregate costs of the customers.

5.2 M-discrepancies
Next we compute the discrepancy between the customer’s
network-level cost derived by (1) metering its traﬃc at its
ingress links (Customer-Ingress or CI) and (2) metering its
traﬃc on each device that the customer uses (Customer-
per-Device or CD). All of the policies result in high M-
discrepancies (ratios as high as 34) as summarized in Ta-
ble 3.
Up to this point, we analyzed the impact of diﬀerent
discrepancies separately. Next, we quantify the joint ef-
fect of F-discrepancies and M-discrepancies, i.e., how large
can the diﬀerence be between the most and the least accu-
rate combination of function and metering schemes. We do
this by comparing the network-level costs of customers un-
der the Volume-Customer+CI, Volume-Customer+CD, and
