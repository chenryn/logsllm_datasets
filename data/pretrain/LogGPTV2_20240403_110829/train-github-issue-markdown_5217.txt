Currently, the meta/main.yml file in roles supports controlling whether
duplicate dependencies will be allowed based on the `allow_duplicates` field
at the root level. However, it's possible that some dependencies should not be
duplicated, while others within the same file should be.
**Implementation:** `allow_duplicates` could remain at the root level, while
`allow_duplicate` could be passed in each dependency block to override the
root setting.
**Use case:** A role to install an application from a git repo depends on
nginx and PHP, and so is dependent upon the 'webserver' role. If a server runs
more than one application, webserver itself should not be loaded again.
However, another 'application_release' role may be responsible for following a
long series of steps to install an application, such as cloning/updating it
from git, running make, copying this release into a new folder, symlinking a
'current_release' folder to the new release, deleting old releases, etc. This
role is appropriate for application-specific roles to load more than once,
with different variables to control the git repo, version, application name,
etc.
In the above, one would require the 'webserver' dependency to not be
duplicated, but the 'appliaction_release' role be duplicated as often as other
roles require it.
