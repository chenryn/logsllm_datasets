User: newb here. I am trying to make a c++ program that will read from a named pipe created by python. My problem is, the named pipe created by python uses os.getpid() as part of the pipe name. when i try calling the pipe from c++, i use getpid(). i am not getting the same value from c++. is there a method equivalent in c++ for os.getpid?
thanks!
edit:
sorry, i am actually using os.getpid() to get the session id via ProcessIDtoSessionID(). i then use the session id as part of the pipe name
Assistant: You won't get the same value if you're running as a separate process as each process has their own process ID. Find some other way to identify the pipe.
