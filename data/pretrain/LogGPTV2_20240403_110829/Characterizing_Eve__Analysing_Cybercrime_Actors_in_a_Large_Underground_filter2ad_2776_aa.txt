Abstract. Underground forums contain many thousands of active users,
but the vast majority will be involved, at most,
in minor levels of
deviance. The number who engage in serious criminal activity is small.
That being said, underground forums have played a signiﬁcant role in
several recent high-proﬁle cybercrime activities. In this work we apply
data science approaches to understand criminal pathways and character-
ize key actors related to illegal activity in one of the largest and longest-
running underground forums. We combine the results of a logistic regres-
sion model with k-means clustering and social network analysis, verifying
the ﬁndings using topic analysis. We identify variables relating to forum
activity that predict the likelihood a user will become an actor of interest
to law enforcement, and would therefore beneﬁt the most from interven-
tion. This work provides the ﬁrst step towards identifying ways to deter
the involvement of young people away from a career in cybercrime.

1 Introduction
Cybercrimes carried out by organized groups using custom tools with political or
military motivations capture the public imagination. However, the vast majority
of attacks are committed by actors with a low level of technical sophistication [24,
34]. While these may receive less media attention, they can cause large ﬁnancial
losses and be costly to defend against [3]. This criminality is to a great extent

promoted by an active underground economy where attack tools and services
are traded, and cyber attacks are monetised [2].
Online underground forums bring together individuals interested in cyber-
crime and illicit online monetizing techniques [12,22]. In contrast with other
forms of crypto-markets [31], some of the contents of these forums are legal, such
as discussions relating to current events, gaming, and technology-related issues.
However, these forums are also used to exchange information about deviant
behaviour, and trade in goods and services with an illicit origin or application.
Previous research has found these forums can provide a stepping stone towards
more serious online criminal activities [13,14].
The underground economy attracts actors that are unlikely to be involved in
traditional crime, but who may become involved in cybercrime [23]. For exam-
ple, the use of booter services for ‘DDoSing’ others has become a widespread
phenomenon among school-aged children, and even victims can become attack-
ers [24]. This is due to the ease of access to hacking tools, the sense of anonymity
provided by the Internet, and the perceived lack of law enforcement online.
Cybercrime has proliferated in recent years, and online forums have become a
key source of data for researchers (see Sect. 2 for related work). While insightful,
this research has mainly relied on cross-sectional data, analysing forum content
from short periods of time or focussing on particular areas of cybercrime. Typi-
cally, researchers have considered only the tools and technologies adversaries use,
not their motivations or personal context [10]. Understanding not only ‘what’
is traded in underground economies, but also ‘why’ and by ‘whom’ can provide
insights into ways to tackle cybercrime from multiple perspectives. The evolution
of oﬀenders, understanding how they learn to commit crime over time, is a key
aspect of this. Multidisciplinary research on the behavioural aspects of cyber-
crime is necessary to develop defences aimed at understanding and preventing
incidents, rather than stopping or recovering from them.
In this paper, we analyse the characteristics and pathways of ‘key actors’;
forum users who have been linked to criminal activities, such as providing ser-
vices and tools to disrupt systems and networks or using these tools to perform
attacks. We use a variety of sources to identify these actors (see Sect. 3). While
we do not publish this list for ethical reasons (see Sect. 6), activities linked to
these key actors include providing DDoS as a service, distributing malware,
operating bot shops and pay-per-install services, as well as providing services for
web exploitation and account cracking. Characterizing key actors and analysing
their evolution within forums is beneﬁcial for various reasons. From a social
perspective, it is the ﬁrst step towards identifying ways to deter people away
from criminal activities. From the cybersecurity perspective, these actors pro-
vide state-of-the art tools and techniques that can be used for attacking systems.
This information can be used by response teams and security ﬁrms to focus their
attention, increasing their capacity to react rapidly to new forms of attack.
We focus our study on Hackforums, one of the largest underground forums.
Hackforums is well established, operating since 2007. While this forum is
known to be overrun by novice teenage hackers (contemptuously dubbed ‘script

kiddies’), in the last few years there have been a number of high proﬁle attacks
directly related to products distributed through this forum. For example, in
September 2016, the Mirai source code was released on the forum, which led to
several related botnets being used for illegal activities such as DDoS attacks [4]
or mining cryptocurrencies [21]. In the ﬁrst three months of 2018, there have
been at least two cases relating to Hackforums users before the UK courts.
We use the CrimeBB dataset, which includes Hackforums data spanning from
2007 onwards and contains information about 572k user accounts [27]. We start
by identifying key actors on the forum. We ﬁrst apply data science approaches
to present a longitudinal study of these key actors. Concretely we apply social
network analysis to analyse their social interests, natural language processing
to classify the type of information posted, and clustering to group the actors
based on forum activity. Our research uncovers common activity patterns and
the pathways taken over time in terms of interests and knowledge. Second we
develop tools to identify factors that predict involvement in cybercrime. These
tools use social network analysis, logistic regression, and clustering to preselect
a list of potential actors, and topic analysis to analyse the type of information
they post. Our ﬁndings suggest that combining the diﬀerent techniques helps in
the prediction of potential actors. These tools can be applied to any particular
cybercrime domain, so we make them publicly available. The CrimeBB dataset
also contains data from other forums and is available to academic researchers
through data sharing agreements from the Cambridge Cybercrime Centre1.
2 Background and Related Work
The rise of cybersecurity incidents parallels the development of underground
economies, where attacking tools and services are easily accessible at low cost
or even for free [2]. For example, pay-per-install services outsource the task of
infecting a machine and allow miscreants to buy ‘installs’ for spreading their
malware [6]. Other common assets that can be found in underground forums are
bot shops and botnets [8], crypters and packers [30], or exploits [2].
Various authors have addressed the oﬀenders perspective. Karami and McCoy
analysed leaked databases of booter services: websites providing DDoS for hire,
publicly marketed as network ‘stressers’, but oﬀered in underground forums as
services to perform DDoS [16]. While mostly used to take down gaming servers,
booters are also used to attack medium-sized websites. Hutchings and Clayton
researched the provision of denial of service attacks, interviewing and surveying
the providers to ask how they began providing the services, and why [14]. They
found most operators were young men from North America. They had escalated
from using booter sites, to setting them up and running them themselves. They
were initially exposed to booter services through gaming and hacker communi-
ties. Financial gain was the main reason for providing services, but they also
reported they enjoyed the challenge of their activities.

Sood and Enbody analyse the provision of cybercrime tools and services,
identifying three type of actors in underground communities: providers or pro-
ducers, advertisers, and buyers [30]. Based on our analysis of underground
forums, we add two new roles. First, re-distributors of modiﬁed versions of public
or leaked malware. This role includes users involved in the provision of encrypted
malware binaries, aimed at avoiding detection by antivirus software. The second
role we dub teachers: actors who provide tutorials for conﬁguration and use of
various attack tools, sometimes accompanied by help-desk services.
According to the criminological theory of diﬀerential association, criminal
activities are normal behaviours learnt in interaction with others [33]. Learning
takes place by associating with others in personal groups. The content of what
is learnt includes speciﬁc techniques to commit crime, as well as the ‘deﬁnitions’
(mindset) favourable to committing crime [37]. In relation to cybercrime, there is
evidence that oﬀenders associate with each other in physical space [18], but also
online, particularly through the use of online underground forums [10,15,38].
Understanding oﬀender pathways allows society to consider the most appro-
priate ways to divert potential oﬀenders away from crime. For example, the
UK’s National Crime Agency (NCA) [23] debriefed young people involved in
cybercrime activities, and found many were ﬁrst exposed through their interest
in gaming. The NCA have subsequently been working with the video gaming
industry to deliver preventative interventions.
Underground forums serve as an entry point into cybercrime for potential
oﬀenders. These forums also allow non-technical actors to learn how to commit
oﬀences and develop their skills [29]. Normally these forums have well-deﬁned
categories like “Hacking” or “Market”. Where authors are most active provides
insights into their interests and expertise [25]. Forum members have a public
proﬁle with information such as the registration date, last access or time spent.
Most underground forums are publicly accessible on the surface web or the ‘dark
web’ (e.g. through Tor hidden services).
The success of underground economies relies on trust and informal social
control [1]. Various authors have analysed these behaviours using social network
analysis (SNA), for example to analyse the evolution of members in terms of
posts and private messages [22] or to understand specialization and develop-
ments of subcommunities [11]. The use of natural language processing (NLP) to
analyse underground forums is also a recurring technique, e.g. to analyse post
sentiment [19] or to identify the assets being traded or the currencies used [28,29].
3 Dataset
In this work we use the CrimeBB dataset [27], which contains data collected from
various underground forums. We focus our study on Hackforums, the largest
forum contained in this dataset, with more than 30 m posts2 made by 572k user
2 We refer to a whole website as a forum, on which pages are set aside for discus-
sion of deﬁned topics in boards, with users participating in conversation threads via
individual posts.

accounts over more than 10 years. Hackforums is divided into nine categories:
Hacking, Technology, Coding, Gaming, Web, Market, Money (a miscellaneous
category for all sorts of money making methods), Graphics and Common (which
includes boards for discussion about various topics, such as entertainment or
politics, and boards intended for forum rules and suggestions).
3.1 Key Actors
We use the term ‘key actor’ to refer to forum users who have been linked to
cybercrime activities, such as distributing malware, oﬀering oﬀ-the-shelf tools to
perform denial-of-service attacks or using these tools to attack others. A number
of approaches were utilised to identify key actors who are or have been active on
Hackforums. These approaches required manual eﬀort and thus are not scalable.
In Sect. 5 we propose tools to automatically identify likely key actors.
1. Media sources were searched to identify reports relating to Hackforums users
being arrested or prosecuted for cybercrime activities (media included oﬃcial
notiﬁcations from law enforcement agencies; forum threads; social media and
blog posts made by security researchers). We used Google extended search
to look for sources including keywords such as ‘arrested’ or ‘prosecuted’ and
‘hackforums’. Results often included the pseudonym used by the actor in the
forum. This method yielded 49 key actors.
2. A private security and intelligence company, Flashpoint, provided usernames
considered to be of interest due to their activities. This yielded 9 key actors.
3. For each actor identiﬁed using the methods above, we used SNA to ﬁnd
their ‘closest’ neighbours (users of the forum who they interact with the
most). Then, we manually analyse the activity of these neighbours looking
for evidence of involvement in cybercrime activities (for instance, evidence of
providing illegal material such as malware or ‘booter’ services). This method
yielded a further 22 actors.
4. The ﬁnal set of key actors are those providing tools aiming at disrupting
systems and/or networks. To identify these actors we had two approaches:
– We searched Hackforums for threads advertising the top 300 Remote
Access Trojans (RATs) reported in [36]. Again, from manual inspection
we identiﬁed the owners/coders of RATs and the re-distributors of mod-
iﬁed versions (e.g. encrypted binaries aimed at avoiding antivirus detec-
tion). We discarded actors who we believed to be only purporting to be
an owner (a stealer); and also actors distributing an infected version of
a binary with the intent of compromising other forum members. This
method yielded 35 key actors (there was some overlap with actors previ-
ously extracted).
– We used ‘compilation’ threads from Hackforums, where popular tools and
services are listed accompanied with the corresponding thread where it
was ﬁrst advertised. This method yielded 15 key actors.
In total, these methods yield 130 actors of interest to law enforcement: of
these, we were able to identify the accounts of 113 within the dataset. The
212

missing accounts might be due to accounts being removed or changes of the
pseudonyms which we were unable to track. Also, it should be noted that various
accounts might belong to the same actor.
4 Characterizing Key Actors
Having identiﬁed 113 key actors, we applied a number of diﬀerent data science
approaches to analyse the forum activity of these users, including NLP, SNA,
and machine learning algorithms.
4.1 Natural Language Processing
Due to the massive size of the dataset (more than 30 m posts), it is not possible
to manually code the data. We use NLP tools to classify posts into categories.
Classiﬁcation of interests and expertise of members enables the identiﬁcation of
topics related to cybercrime oﬀences, such as learning to attack systems or trad-
ing in stolen accounts. The data poses interesting problems for NLP techniques.
The language used by members of underground forums includes technical jargon
and non-standard means of expression. Contributors include non-native speak-
ers of English, and short texts in which information is conveyed in deliberately
concise ways. In this work we analyse the behavioural evolution of our identiﬁed
actors, ﬁrstly building a binary classiﬁer to identify questions in CrimeBB.
Three annotators manually labelled 2,200 posts selected from a range of
boards, with substantial inter-annotator agreement for post type (see more
details in [7]). We use the annotated dataset to train and test the classiﬁer,
with a training subset of 175 annotated threads from various boards, and a test
subset of 186 annotated threads from another board (to prevent overﬁtting).
For each thread, we extract features using a set of statistical techniques and a
set of heuristics, having found this hybrid approach to work best [7]. The for-
mer include the number of replies, the number of links in the ﬁrst post (both
to external sources and to other threads in the forum), the length of the ﬁrst
post and a set of unigram features extracted from text. We convert every thread
title and post into a document-term matrix (a matrix of counts with each word
occurring as column values, and each of the documents as a row). We strip
punctuation, convert to lower case characters, ignore numbers and exclude stop
words. Finally, word counts are transformed using TF-IDF (‘term frequency
inverse document frequency’), a weighting that promotes words occurring fairly
frequently in few documents above those occurring highly frequently but ubiq-
uitously across CrimeBB [32].
The heuristics are formed through our expertise in analysing forum data.
Concretely, for each thread we get the frequency of particularly interesting key-
words in the heading and ﬁrst post (examples of these keywords are “looking
for”, “I need help” or “I have a question”). Finally, we also account for the
number of question marks in the heading.

We use a Linear SVM to build a classiﬁer. Again, the selection of the algo-
rithm is based on previous experimentation with the dataset [7]. For evaluation
we use the usual metrics for information retrieval, i.e. precision, recall and F1.
