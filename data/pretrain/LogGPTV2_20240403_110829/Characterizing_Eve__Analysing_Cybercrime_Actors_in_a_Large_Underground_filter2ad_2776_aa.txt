## Abstract

Underground forums are home to thousands of active users, but only a small fraction engages in serious criminal activities. Despite this, these forums have played a significant role in high-profile cybercrimes. This study applies data science techniques to understand the pathways and characteristics of key actors involved in illegal activities on one of the largest and longest-running underground forums. We combine logistic regression, k-means clustering, and social network analysis, validated by topic analysis, to identify variables that predict the likelihood of a user becoming a person of interest to law enforcement. Our findings provide the first step towards deterring young people from pursuing a career in cybercrime.

**Keywords:** Cybercrime, Underground Forums, Social Behavior, Criminal Pathways

## 1. Introduction

While highly sophisticated cyberattacks by organized groups with political or military motivations capture public attention, the majority of cybercrimes are committed by individuals with low technical skills. These attacks, though less publicized, can cause significant financial losses and are costly to defend against. The underground economy, where attack tools and services are traded, plays a crucial role in promoting such criminality.

Online underground forums serve as hubs for individuals interested in cybercrime and illicit online monetization. Unlike other crypto-markets, some content on these forums is legal, such as discussions on current events, gaming, and technology. However, they also facilitate the exchange of information on deviant behavior and trade in illicit goods and services. Research has shown that these forums can be a stepping stone to more serious online criminal activities.

The underground economy attracts individuals who might not engage in traditional crime but may become involved in cybercrime. For example, the use of booter services for DDoS attacks is prevalent among school-aged children, and even victims can become attackers due to the ease of access to hacking tools, the anonymity provided by the internet, and the perceived lack of law enforcement online.

Cybercrime has proliferated in recent years, and online forums have become a key source of data for researchers. While insightful, most research has relied on cross-sectional data, analyzing forum content over short periods or focusing on specific areas of cybercrime. Understanding the motivations and personal context of cybercriminals, in addition to the tools and technologies they use, is essential for developing comprehensive defenses.

In this paper, we analyze the characteristics and pathways of key actorsâ€”forum users linked to criminal activities such as providing DDoS services, distributing malware, operating bot shops, and offering web exploitation and account cracking services. Characterizing these key actors and their evolution within forums is beneficial for both social and cybersecurity perspectives. It helps in identifying ways to deter people from criminal activities and provides insights into state-of-the-art tools and techniques used for attacking systems.

We focus our study on Hackforums, one of the largest and longest-running underground forums. Despite being known for novice teenage hackers, Hackforums has been linked to several high-profile attacks, such as the release of the Mirai source code, which led to multiple botnets being used for illegal activities. Using the CrimeBB dataset, which includes Hackforums data from 2007 onwards, we apply data science approaches to conduct a longitudinal study of key actors. We use social network analysis, natural language processing, and clustering to uncover common activity patterns and pathways. Additionally, we develop tools to predict involvement in cybercrime, which can be applied to any cybercrime domain.

## 2. Background and Related Work

The rise of cybersecurity incidents parallels the development of underground economies, where attack tools and services are easily accessible at low cost or even for free. Pay-per-install services, bot shops, crypters, and exploits are common assets found in these forums. Various studies have analyzed the offenders' perspective, including the use of booter services, provision of DDoS attacks, and the roles of providers, advertisers, and buyers in underground communities.

Criminological theory suggests that criminal activities are learned through interactions with others. In the context of cybercrime, there is evidence that offenders associate both in physical and online spaces, particularly through underground forums. Understanding offender pathways is crucial for developing interventions to divert potential offenders away from crime.

## 3. Dataset

We use the CrimeBB dataset, which contains data from various underground forums, focusing on Hackforums, the largest forum in the dataset with over 30 million posts made by 572,000 user accounts over more than 10 years. Hackforums is divided into nine categories: Hacking, Technology, Coding, Gaming, Web, Market, Money, Graphics, and Common.

### 3.1 Key Actors

We define key actors as forum users linked to cybercrime activities. We identified these actors using several methods:

1. **Media Sources:** We searched media reports, official notifications from law enforcement agencies, forum threads, and blog posts by security researchers. This method yielded 49 key actors.
2. **Flashpoint Data:** A private security and intelligence company, Flashpoint, provided usernames of interest due to their activities, yielding 9 key actors.
3. **Social Network Analysis (SNA):** We used SNA to find the closest neighbors of identified actors and manually analyzed their activities for evidence of involvement in cybercrime, yielding 22 additional actors.
4. **Tool Providers:** We identified actors providing tools for disrupting systems and networks by searching for threads advertising top Remote Access Trojans (RATs) and using compilation threads, yielding 35 and 15 key actors, respectively.

In total, these methods identified 130 actors of interest, with 113 accounts found in the dataset.

## 4. Characterizing Key Actors

To analyze the forum activity of the 113 key actors, we applied various data science approaches, including natural language processing (NLP), social network analysis (SNA), and machine learning algorithms.

### 4.1 Natural Language Processing

Given the massive size of the dataset (over 30 million posts), manual coding is impractical. We used NLP tools to classify posts into categories, enabling the identification of topics related to cybercrime offenses. The language used in these forums is challenging due to technical jargon, non-standard expressions, and contributions from non-native English speakers.

We built a binary classifier to identify questions in CrimeBB. Three annotators manually labeled 2,200 posts, achieving substantial inter-annotator agreement. We used the annotated dataset to train and test the classifier, using a training subset of 175 threads and a test subset of 186 threads. Features were extracted using statistical techniques and heuristics, including the number of replies, links, post length, and unigram features. We converted thread titles and posts into a document-term matrix, stripped punctuation, converted to lowercase, ignored numbers, and excluded stop words. Word counts were transformed using TF-IDF.

Heuristics included the frequency of specific keywords in headings and first posts, and the number of question marks in headings. We used a Linear SVM to build the classifier, evaluated using precision, recall, and F1 scores.
