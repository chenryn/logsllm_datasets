the subjects in these databases are students, and
we believe provide a good representative population
for our study. Additional images for typical male
subjects were derived from a random sampling of
images from the Sports IllustratedTMNBA gallery.

words were chosen during the semester, implying
that a few users changed their password at least
once. During the evaluation period there were a to-
tal of 2648 login attempts, of which 2271 (85.76%)
were successful. Toward the end of the semester,
students were asked to complete an exit survey in
which they described why they picked the faces they
did (for Face) or their chosen stories (for Story)
and provide some demographic information about
themselves. This information was used to validate
some of our ﬁndings which we discuss shortly. Ta-
ble 1 summarizes the demographic information for
our users. A gender or race of any includes those for
which the user did not specify their gender or race.
Such users account for diﬀerences between the sum
of numbers of passwords for individual populations
and populations permitting a race or gender of any.
The students participating in this study did so vol-
untarily and with the knowledge they were par-
ticipating in a study, as required by the Institu-
tional Review Boards of the participating univer-
sities. However, they were not instructed as to the
particular factors being studied and, in particular,
that the passwords they selected were of primary
interest. Nor were they informed of the questions
they would be asked at the end of the study. As
such, we do not believe that knowledge of our study
inﬂuenced their password choices. In addition, since
personal information such as their individual grades
were protected using their passwords, we have rea-
son to believe that they did not choose them inten-
tionally to be easily guessable.
4 Security evaluation
Recall that in both the Face and Story schemes,
images are grouped into non-overlapping categories.
In our derivations below, we make the simplifying
assumption that images in a category are equiva-
lent, that is, the speciﬁc images in a category that
are available do not signiﬁcantly inﬂuence a user’s
choice in picking a speciﬁc category.
First we introduce some notation. An (cid:1)-element tu-
ple x is denoted x((cid:1)). If S is either the Face or Story
scheme, then the expression x((cid:1)) ← S denotes the
selection of an (cid:1)-tuple x((cid:1)) (a password or password
preﬁx, consisting of (cid:1) image categories) according
to S, involving both user choices and random algo-
rithm choices.
4.1 Password distribution
p(k) ← S(cid:2)
(cid:1)
In this section we describe how we approximately
for any p(k), i.e., the proba-
compute Pr
bility that the scheme yields the password p(k). This
probability is taken with respect to both random
choices by the password selection algorithm and user
choices.
We compute this probability inductively as follows.
Suppose p((cid:1)+1) = q((cid:1))r(1). Then

p((cid:1)+1) ← S

real-valued parameter; and where if ˆ(cid:1) > 0 then
(cid:4)
(cid:3)
q((cid:1))r(1) ← S | q((cid:1)) ← S
Ψˆ(cid:1)−1 = Prˆ(cid:1)−1
and Ψˆ(cid:1)−1 = 1/N otherwise. Note that as λˆ(cid:1) is re-
duced toward 0, (5) converges toward (4). And,
as λˆ(cid:1) is increased, (5) converges toward Ψˆ(cid:1)−1, i.e.,
a probability under Assumption 4.1 for ˆ(cid:1) − 1, a
stronger assumption. So, with suﬃcient data, we
can use a small λˆ(cid:1) and thus a weaker assumption.
Otherwise, using a small λˆ(cid:1) risks relying too heavily
on a small number of occurrences of . . . s(ˆ(cid:1)) ← S,
and so we use a large λˆ(cid:1) and thus the stronger as-
sumption.
4.2 Measures
We are primarily concerned with measuring the abil-
ity of an attacker to guess the password of a user.
for each
Given accurate values for Pr
p(k), a measure that indicates this ability is the
“guessing entropy” [18] of passwords.
Informally,
guessing entropy measures the expected number of
guesses an attacker with perfect knowledge of the

bution. If we enumerate passwords p1

Guessing entropy is closely related to Shannon en-
tropy, and relations between the two are known.1
Since guessing entropy intuitively corresponds more
closely to the attacker’s task in which we are inter-
ested (guessing a password), we will mainly consider
measures motivated by the guessing entropy.
The direct use of (6) to compute guessing entropy
using the probabilities in (5) is problematic for two
reasons. First, an attacker guessing passwords will
be oﬀered additional information when performing
a guess, such as the set of available categories from
which the next image can be chosen. For example,
in Face, each image choice is taken from nine images
that represent nine categories of images, chosen uni-
formly at random from the twelve categories. This
additional information constrains the set of possible
passwords, and the attacker would have this infor-
mation when performing a guess in many scenarios.
Second, we have found that the absolute probabil-
ities yielded by (5) can be somewhat sensitive to
the choice of λˆ(cid:1), which introduces uncertainty into
calculations that utilize these probabilities numeri-
cally.

To account for the second of these issues, we use the
probabilities computed with (5) only to determine
(k), . . .) of passwords
an enumeration Π = (p1
in non-increasing order of probability (as computed
with (5)). This enumeration is far less sensitive to
variations in λˆ(cid:1) than the numeric probabilities are,
