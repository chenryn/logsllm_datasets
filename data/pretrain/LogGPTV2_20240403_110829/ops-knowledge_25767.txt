User: I already know there are ssh modules for Python, that's not for what I'm looking for.
What I want to have is an python script to do the following:

> connect to an [ input by user ] SSH host
> connect using the credentials [ provided by the user ]
> run command on the SSH host [ telnet to [host - input by user ]
> Select menu item in the telnet session

Thanks in advance,
Best regards,
Assistant: There are many libraries to do that.

Subprocess
Pexpect 
Paramiko (Mostly used)
Fabric
Exscript

You can check their documentation for the implementation.
