I am already aware of the SSH modules available for Python, but that is not what I am looking for. 

What I need is a Python script that performs the following tasks:

1. Connect to an SSH host (input provided by the user).
2. Use the credentials provided by the user to establish the connection.
3. Run a command on the SSH host to initiate a Telnet session with another host (also input by the user).
4. Select a menu item within the Telnet session.

Thank you in advance for your assistance.

Best regards,

There are several libraries that can help you achieve this. Some of the commonly used ones include:

- **Subprocess**: For running shell commands.
- **Pexpect**: For automating interactive applications.
- **Paramiko**: A widely-used library for SSH connections.
- **Fabric**: For streamlining the use of SSH for application deployment or systems administration tasks.
- **Exscript**: For automating Telnet and SSH sessions.

You can refer to the documentation for each of these libraries to find the best implementation for your needs.
