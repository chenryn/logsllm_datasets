User: What editors or IDEs offer decent autocompletion for wxPython on Windows or Linux? Are there any? I tried several and support is either non-existant or limited.
Assistant: I use Eclipse/PyDev for wxPython development. I've been very satisfied with Eclipse for Python development productivity. It does have support for autocompletion for wxPython.
