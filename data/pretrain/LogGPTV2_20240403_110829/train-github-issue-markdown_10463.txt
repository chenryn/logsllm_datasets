Subject: Request for CSS Prefixing Option in Twitter Bootstrap

Dear Twitter Bootstrap Team,

We frequently encounter use cases where Twitter Bootstrap is integrated into only a portion of a webpage's design. In these instances, conflicts often arise between Bootstrap’s CSS and other elements on the page, such as jQuery plugins, custom code, and legacy templates. 

To mitigate these issues, we suggest implementing an option to prefix the CSS classes in Twitter Bootstrap. This would allow us to limit the scope of Bootstrap’s styles to specific sections of the page, thereby preventing unwanted style collisions.

Thank you for considering this enhancement. We believe it would significantly improve the flexibility and compatibility of Twitter Bootstrap in diverse web development environments.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
