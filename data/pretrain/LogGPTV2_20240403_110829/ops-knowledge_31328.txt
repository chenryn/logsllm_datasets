**User:**
I am using a `.pdbrc` file to store my debugging aliases, and I want it to be available globally on Windows. Where should I place this file?

**Assistant:**
To make the `.pdbrc` file available globally on Windows, you should place it in the `C:\Users\<your_user>` directory. If this does not work, you can also try setting the `HOME` environment variable to `C:\Users\<your_user>`. This approach worked for me.

Thanks to @WayneWerner for providing the solution.
