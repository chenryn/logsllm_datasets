User: I am using .pdbrc to store my debugging alias. And I want it to be available globally. Where should this file be on windows?
Assistant: If putting the file in C:\Users\<your_user> doesn't work, additionaly try setting your HOME environment variable to C:\Users\<your_user>. Worked for me.
Thanks to @WayneWerner for the solution.
