User: I'm getting a lot of requests to my appengine app from a malicious user and I suspect it might be an attempt at a DOS attack. I need to add thier IP address to blacklists on GAE. However when I look at 

self.request.remote_addr

all I get is my own IP address. How can I get the remote IP of the client that is actually sending me these requests?
Assistant: You could see the IP on the Logs page in the admin panel. Click the 'plus' icon next to a log item in order to expand it and view request data.
