see if those networks had more attacks than the networks 
already explored with the bots. For two weeks, channels 
in  UnderNet  (i.e.,  #usa  and  #allnightcafe)  and  EFNet 
(i.e.,  #chat  and  #poker)  were  set  up  similarly  to  the 
channels  with  the  bots,  one  male,  one  female  and  one 
ambiguous, except that all the connections were humans 
instead of bots. The number of users in each channel was 
around  300.  The  name  of  the  users  was  changed  each 
week 
of 
female/male/ambiguous  names  listed  in  Section  4.2. 
Three users (one female, one male and one ambiguous) 
were placed in each of the four channels. The number of 
different  types  of  attacks  per  day,  per  channel  and  for 
each  type  of  user,  shown  in  Table  3,  is  based  on  two 
weeks of collected data. Table 3 also contains the 95% 
confidence interval around the mean assuming a normal 
distribution of the different attack types. For some attack 
types, no attack was observed for both weeks. For these 
cases,  the  confidence  interval  could  not  be  calculated. 
These cases are indicated with “N/A” in Table 3.

connections remained the same. One difference from the 
other  experiments  was  that  the  female  usernames  were 
receiving  more  files  and  links  than  the  male  and 
ambiguous usernames, though the gap was not nearly as 
wide as it was for private messages. Indeed, between 1.2 
and 2.5 files were sent per day, when, for bots, between 
0.1 and 1 files were sent. Moreover, when the number of 
files sent to female users is higher than the number sent 
to  male  users,  the  lowest  was  sent  to  users  with 
ambiguous names. As for experiments 1 and 2, almost no 
DCC connections were observed. Depending on the user 
type,  between  5.0  and  6.5  links  were  sent  to  the  user. 
This is also higher than for the bots where 2 links were 
observed.  When  the  highest  number  of  links  was 
observed for female users, the users with an ambiguous 
name  received  fewer  links  than  the  users  with  a  male 
name. All three types of human users also received more 
malicious private messages than the associated bots (i.e., 
163 versus 100 for female names, 28 versus 4 for male 
names,  and  65  versus  25  for  ambiguous  names).  For 
human users, female users received about 6 times more 
private messages than the male users and about 3 times 
more  than  the  users  with  an  ambiguous  name.  Overall, 
the networks that did not allow bots (i.e., UnderNet and 
EFNet)  seemed  to  produce  more  attacks  than  the 
networks  that  did  allow  bots  (i.e.,  GalaxyNet  and 
QuakeNet). The fact that the two networks used in this 
experiment produced a difference between the male and 
female  users  like  that  of  the  other  two  networks 
reinforces the findings of the second experiment (Section 
4.2).  
4.4 
In addition to helping to assess the attack threat, the 
experiments  provided  some  insight  into  the  social 
structure of IRC. Even in channels containing hundreds 
of  people,  only  a  small  group  of  people  actually 
participated  in  the  conversations.  The  rest  of  the 
connections  remained  idle  or  broadcast  spam  into  the 
channel  before  eventually  being  removed.  When  two 
bots had conversations, they seemed to generate attention 
for  a  few  minutes,  as  people  were  trying  to  figure  out 
whom  the  bots  were  talking  to,  but  after  a  short  while 
they were ignored. This exposed a flaw in the setup: the 
bots  were  unable  to  communicate  with  the  rest  of  the 
channel,  and  would  not  be  able  to  do  so  effectively 
without more complicated scripts. The extra attention the 
female  usernames  received  and  the  nature  of  the 
messages (i.e., sexually explicit or threatening language) 
they  were  bombarded  with  suggests  that  male  users 
outnumber  females,  as  it  would  be  difficult  for  an 
automated  script  to  filter  usernames  based  on  gender 
when sending messages. This indicates the male human 
users specifically targeted female users. 
Analysis of Results 
One  rather  surprising  result  was  the  fact  that 
networks that banned bots seemed to have a higher threat 
of  attack.  This  goes  directly  against  the hypothesis that 
the  majority  of  attacks  were  conducted  by  automated 
bots. It is unclear why the networks without bots seem to 
be  less  prone  to  attacks  on  users.  Analysis  of  the  user 
kicks (i.e., on average 20 kicks/hour on GalaxyNet, 10.7 
kicks/hour on QuakeNet, 16.4 kicks/hour on EFNet, and 
14.2 kicks/hour on UnderNet) indicated a higher rate of 
users  who  committed  attacks  getting  removed  from 
channels  in  the  networks  that  allowed  bots.  Since  the 
bots can be used as administrators, it is possible that they 
assist  in  cutting  down  on  spam  and  other  forms  of 
harassment.  However,  the  networks  that  did  not  allow 
bots  did  provide  administration  bots 
to  registered 
channels. 
One  constant  throughout  the  results  of  all  three 
setups was the relative frequencies of the different types 
of  attacks.  DCC  connections  were  the  least  common, 
probably  because  they  can  only  be  effectively  used  as 
attacks against bots. File connection attempts were also 
rare,  and  significantly  less  common  than  suspicious 
links.  This  is  probably  because  both  can  perform  the 
function  of  sending  a  virus  to  another  computer,  and 
links have the benefits of not requiring the other user to 
accept the transaction and the ability to send commands 
as  well  as  files.  Note  that  file  sent,  DCC  connections, 
and links were not investigated further (i.e., by opening 
them) because we did not have the necessary apparatus 
to  contain  the  potential  infection.  The  most  common 
attack  by  far  was  malicious  private  messages  (i.e., 
sexually  explicit  or  threatening  language).  This  is 
probably  the  most  prevalent  attack  because  it  does  not 
require programming knowledge, malicious code, or, for 
that matter, anything but an IRC client to send. Among 
the  private  messages,  on  average,  we  found  30%  of 
malicious  ones  for  the  female  bots,  24%  for  the  male 
bots,  23%  for  the  ambiguous  bots,  28%  for  the  female 
human  users,  26%  for  the  male  human  users,  and  25% 
for  the  ambiguous  human  users.  Most  other  private 
messages  include  “hello”  or  “how  are  you  doing?” 
messages 
typically  would  be  followed  by  a 
malicious  private  message  (i.e.,  sexually  explicit  or 
threatening language).

or  not  a  user  is  active  in  a  channel.  Users  with  female 
names are, however, far more likely to receive malicious 
private messages, slightly more likely to receive files and 
links,  and  equally  likely  to  be  attacked  in  other  ways.

ambiguous names are far less likely to receive malicious 
private  messages  than  female  users,  but  more  likely  to 
receive them than male users. Users in channels that do 
not  allow  bots  at  all  are  more  likely  to  receive  attacks 
than  users  in  channels  that  allow  a  minimal  number  of 
bots.
