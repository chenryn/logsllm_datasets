SITCH
Inexpensive, coordinated GSM anomaly detection
About Me
• 2000: Technology career started (I can get paid for this??) 
• 2003: Started building with Linux 
• Came to infosec through systems and network engineering, integration 
• Security tools and integration (SIEM, HIDS, etc…) 
• Current: R&D

What We’re Covering Today
• Why Care? 
• Current Threat and Detection Landscape 
• Project Goals 
• SITCH: MkI 
• SITCH: MkII 
• Service Architecture 
• Future Plans 
• Prior Art 
• Q&A
Why Care?
• Invasions of privacy are bad, even when they’re unnoticed. 
• Industrial espionage costs money and jobs.
WTF Is Under All That??
Is Anybody Home?
Terminology
• Software Deﬁned Radio (SDR): Using software to perform 
signal processing in concert with an adjustable-frequency 
RF receiver 
• FCCH: Frequency Correction Channel 
• ARFCN: Absolute Radio Frequency Channel Number 
• CGI: Cell Global ID (MCC + MNC + LAC + CI) 
• IMSI: International Mobile Subscriber Identity
GSM Addressing
Threat and Detection Landscape
• Malicious Devices 
• Indicators of Attack 
• Existing Detection Methods
Hacked Femtocell
Trusted part of provider’s network 
Your phone doesn’t know it’s evil
Evil BTS
Handset will automatically associate, 
unable to assert trustworthiness
Indicators of Attack
• ARFCN over threshold 
• ARFCN outside forecast 
• Unrecognized CGI 
• Gratuitous BTS re-association 
• BTS detected outside of range
Existing Detection Methods
• Commercial Options: 
• Pwnie Express 
• Bastille Networks 
• Open Source: 
• Fake BTS 
• AIMSICD 
• Femto Catcher
Project Goals
• Inexpensive (what can I get for $100?) 
• Small footprint, low power requirements preferred 
• Functional Targets: Indicators of Attack (IOA) Coverage
Tested Hardware

Functional Targets
• ARFCN over threshold
