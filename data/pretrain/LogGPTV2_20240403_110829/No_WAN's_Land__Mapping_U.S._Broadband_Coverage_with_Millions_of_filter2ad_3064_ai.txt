Fig. 9 presents the same competition analysis as in Section 4.4,
but separated by the maximum speed offered in the census block
(according to Form 477 data) rather than whether the census is
urban or rural. We use speed tiers of any service (≥ 0 Mbps) and
benchmark broadband (≥ 25 Mbps). We do not find significant
differences in competition overstatements by speed tier.
K FULL REGRESSION RESULTS
Table 14 shows the full results of the ordinary least squares regres-
sion analysis described in Section 4.5). We used the patsy statistical
model library for analysis [73], which encoded away the categori-
cal value for Arkansas because the regression model contains an
intercept.
L EXPLORATION OF POSSIBLE COVERAGE
UNDERREPORTING
We conducted a small-scale evaluation in September 2019 of whether
ISPs might underreport coverage to the FCC in Form 477 filings. We
focused on the four major ISPs in Wisconsin: AT&T, CenturyLink,
Charter, and Frontier.
