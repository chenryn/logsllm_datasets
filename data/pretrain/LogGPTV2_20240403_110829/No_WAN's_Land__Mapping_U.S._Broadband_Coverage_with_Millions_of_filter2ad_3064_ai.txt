### Competition Analysis by Maximum Speed Offered

Figure 9 presents a competition analysis similar to that in Section 4.4, but it is stratified by the maximum speed offered in each census block (as per Form 477 data) rather than by whether the census block is urban or rural. We use two speed tiers: any service (≥ 0 Mbps) and benchmark broadband (≥ 25 Mbps). Our findings indicate no significant differences in competition overstatements across these speed tiers.

### Full Regression Results

Table 14 provides the complete results of the ordinary least squares regression analysis described in Section 4.5. For this analysis, we utilized the patsy statistical model library [73], which encoded the categorical value for Arkansas as the reference category due to the presence of an intercept in the regression model.

### Exploration of Possible Coverage Underreporting

In September 2019, we conducted a small-scale evaluation to determine if Internet Service Providers (ISPs) might underreport coverage to the FCC in their Form 477 filings. This evaluation focused on the four major ISPs in Wisconsin: AT&T, CenturyLink, Charter, and Frontier.

### Analysis of Address and Population Coverage Overstatements

#### Table 12: Any Broadband Coverage
This table analyzes address and population coverage overstatements for any broadband coverage, treating BAT responses of "address unrecognized" or "response unknown" as equivalent to "address not covered."
