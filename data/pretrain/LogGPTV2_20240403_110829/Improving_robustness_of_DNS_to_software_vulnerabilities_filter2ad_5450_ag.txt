### Domain Analysis and Ad-Abuse Infrastructure

**Domain Categorization:**
We manually analyzed the remaining domains and found that only three domains were mistakenly added to the set DA by the spectral expansion module. The rest of the domains were related to ad-abuse. The category "No Active IP Address" in Table 3.2 includes domains that only resolved to known sinkholes, parking IPs, or were never registered. 

- **Sinkholed:** Domains that were sinkholed by researchers.
- **Two TDSS Parking Services:** Domains registered later in the four-year period and pointed to the same two parking services used by known TDSS domains during the same time.
- **Never Registered:** 268 of the newly detected domains were never registered. However, based on the significant host overlap with known TDSS domains and name string characteristics, we concluded that these domains were related to the TDSS/TDL4 botnet.

Overall, the spectral expansion algorithm (Algorithm 1) produced a high-quality set of TDSS/TDL4 domains (DA) while introducing a low number of non-TDSS/TDL4 domains (3 out of 838 new domains). After removing these three domains, we used the remaining 1,131 domains to analyze the ad-abuse Command and Control (C&C) infrastructure. The 765 domains that survived the sanitization process were used to analyze the financial impact on the ad ecosystem.

### Ad-Abuse Reports

#### 3.6.1 C&C Infrastructure

Using the 1,131 domains in set DA, we analyzed the network infrastructure used by the ad-abuse component of the botnet. We categorized IP addresses into parking, sinkhole, and active categories. Besides well-known parking and sinkholing IPs, we considered IPs with more than 1,000 historical domains as parking IPs due to the α threshold discussed in Section 3.5.2. All other IP addresses were considered active.

- **Total Domains and IPs:** At least 863 domains were registered, and the botnet used 228 IP addresses over a period of two years and ten months until 10/15/2013.
- **Activity Period:** These domains were mostly active before the middle of 2012. In July 2012, researchers started sinkholing some TDSS/TDL4 domains, which may have forced the botmasters to change their monetization tactics.

**Lifetime Analysis:**
- **Active Days:** Half of the ad-abuse C&C domains resolved to different active IP addresses for more than 90 days, and 20% were active for more than 240 days (Figure 3.9a).
- **Monetization Period:** The cumulative distribution of the monetization period shows that 30% of the domains were monetized for more than six months, and 7% for more than a year (Figure 3.9b).

**Geographical Distribution:**
- **Hosting Infrastructure:** We obtained ASN information for 195 out of 228 total active IP addresses, which are under 49 different Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs), 59 CIDRs, and 24 countries.
- **Top Countries:** Table 3.3 shows the top 7 countries where the C&C infrastructure was identified, accounting for 71% of the IP addresses.

#### 3.6.2 Financial Analysis

We used Equation (3.2) to estimate the financial loss to advertisers. For our local network (the US ISP), we calculated the DNS Ad-abuse Rate (ζ = 27.62) and the percentage for impression fraud (pim = 99.13%). Using a CPM of $2, we calculated the daily number of DNS requests (Ri) to domains used for ad-abuse that resolved to active IP addresses. This resulted in 1.2 billion DNS requests in total.

- **Ad Impressions:** We used µim = 5 for our lower bound estimate, based on instances where up to 50 ads were returned per Protocol 1 request.
- **Financial Loss:** We estimate at least $346 million in ad-abuse over the lifetime of TDSS/TDL4 (Figure 3.10). The daily financial loss averaged $340,000, peaking at $1.97 million on 1/7/2012 before the first domain was sinkholed on 7/11/2012.

**Global Impact:**
- **ISP Network:** Victims in the entire ISP accounted for 30% of the total botnet population in the US, and the infected hosts in the US were less than 50% of the global botnet population. Thus, our estimates may only cover less than 15% of the entire botnet population.

**Cost and Revenue:**
- **Operating Costs:** The ad-abuse hosting infrastructure was located in 228 different IPs. The average cost to operate the TDSS/TDL4 C&C infrastructure is estimated between $44,000 and $260,000 over four years.
- **Potential Revenue:** The potential financial reward for affiliates is in the order of tens of millions of dollars, with an estimated revenue of 7% of money spent by advertisers ($24.22 million).

**Stakeholder Breakdown:**
- **Table 3.4:** Provides a financial breakdown among the entities of the online ad ecosystem, showing the potential financial reward for the botnet operators and affiliates.

**Impact on the Internet:**
- **Table 3.5:** Shows the extent to which TDSS/TDL4 affected the Internet, including the top 6 countries and ad networks targeted.

This analysis provides a comprehensive view of the TDSS/TDL4 botnet's ad-abuse operations, its financial impact, and the geographical distribution of its C&C infrastructure.
