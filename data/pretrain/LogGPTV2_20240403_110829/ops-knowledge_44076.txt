User: Please list commonly used network protocols and their functions. For example, TCP, UDP, HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, etc.
Assistant: Commonly used network protocols and their functions are as follows: 1. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol): A connection-oriented protocol that provides reliable data transmission. It is responsible for establishing, maintaining and terminating connections in the network, ensuring data integrity, reliability and orderliness. 2. UDP (User Datagram Protocol): A connectionless protocol that provides unreliable data transmission. It is not responsible for establishing a connection, it is only responsible for sending the datagram to the target address, and does not guarantee the correctness and reliability of the data. 3. HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol): used to transfer hypertext between the client and the server. It is a stateless request-response protocol that is responsible for the format of requests and responses, including header information, status codes, and response bodies. 4. HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure): Encrypted HTTP protocol. It uses the SSL/TLS protocol to encrypt HTTP to provide a secure communication environment and protect user privacy and data security. 5. FTP (File Transfer Protocol): used to transfer files between the client and the server. It is a connection-oriented protocol that provides functions such as file upload and download, and supports file format conversion and directory management. 6. SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol): Used to transfer emails between mail transfer agents. It is responsible for sending the e-mail sent by the sender to the mail server designated by the recipient, and it can also be forwarded between mail servers. 7. POP3 (Post Office Protocol Version 3): used to receive e-mail from the mail server. It is a connection-oriented protocol that allows users to pull their own mail from the mail server through an authentication mechanism. 8. IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol): used to manage e-mail from the mail server. It is a connection-oriented protocol, similar to POP3, but the difference is that it allows users to manage emails both locally and remotely, and can synchronize email status between multiple devices.
