that the combination with personal information inside an
SNS could pose a signiﬁcant threat to user privacy.
There has been signiﬁcant work in the interplay be-
tween SNSs and privacy. For example, there has been
some focus on protecting privacy in SNS against third-
party applications installed in a user’s proﬁle within the
social network [41, 40, 55]. Facecloak [49] shields a
user’s personal information from a SNS and any third-
party interaction, by providing fake information to the
SNS and storing actual, sensitive information in an en-
crypted form on a separate server. The authors in Fly-
ByNight [48] propose the use of public key cryptography
among friends in a SNS so as to protect their information
from a curious social provider and potential data leaks.
Recent work has focused on how to support personal-
ized advertisements without revealing the user’s personal
information to the providing party. Adnostic [57] offers
targeted advertising while preserving the user’s privacy
by having the web browser proﬁle the user, through the
monitoring of his browsing history, and inferring his in-
terests. It then downloads diverse content from the ad-
vertising server and selects which part of it to display to
the user. Similarly, RePriv [42] enables the browser to
mine a user’s web behavior to infer guidelines for con-
tent personalization, which are ultimately communicated
to interested sites. Our approach differs in principle as
the model of these previous systems prevents a web site
from building a proﬁle for the user while we decouple
the identiﬁcation step the user undergoes, to access his
already existing social proﬁle, with his subsequent re-
quests for content personalization.
Mayer et al. [50] highlight the threats against user pri-
vacy by the cross-site tracking capabilities of third-party
web services. The authors detail a plethora of tracking
technologies used by the embedded pages of advertise-
ment, analytics, and social networking services. Their
work demonstrates the high level of sophistication in
web tracking technologies, and their resiliency against
browser countermeasures.
Roesner et al. [53] study the tracking ecosystem of
third-party web services and discuss current defenses, in-
cluding third-party cookie blocking. They identify cases
where tracking services actively try to evade such restric-
tions by bringing themselves in a ﬁrst party position, e.g.,
by spawning pop-up windows. Moreover, the authors
present cases in which services are treated as ﬁrst par-
ties when visited directly and intentionally by the users,
and at the same time appear embedded as third parties
in web sites, as is the case with social networking ser-
vices and their social plugins. Overall, they conclude that
current restrictions imposed by browsers against third-
party tracking are not fool-proof, and at the same time
ﬁnd more than 500 tracking services, some with the ca-
pability to capture more than 20% of a user’s browsing
behavior.
A series of browser add-ons exist [7, 26] that block so-
cial plugins from the web pages a user visits by removing
them or preventing them from loading, in a manner sim-
ilar to what Adblock [1] does for advertisements. How-
ever, they come at the cost of full loss of functionality as
social plugins are completely removed from a page. Note
that some of these add-ons are poorly implemented and
naively remove the social plugins only after they have ap-
peared on a page, meaning that the corresponding HTTP
request containing user-identifying information has al-
ready been issued towards the server.
ShareMeNot [28, 53] is a Firefox add-on that strips
user cookies from a series of HTTP requests that the
web browser issues to load social plugins. As a result,
no user-identifying information is sent to the social net-
working service until the user explicitly interacts with
the social plugin. The downside of this approach is that
users are deprived of any personalized information of-
fered by the plugin, e.g., the number and names of any
of their friends that might have already interacted with
a page.
In other words, users view these social plug-
ins as if they were logged out from the respective SNS
(or browsing in “incognito” mode). Our approach differs
from ShareMeNot in that it focuses on providing the full
content personalization of existing social plugins while
protecting user privacy.
9 Conclusion
References
Concerns about the interplay between social plugins and
privacy are mounting rapidly. Tensions have reached the
point that even governments consider to outlaw Face-
book’s Like button [13]. Recently, in an ofﬁcial response
to questions regarding user privacy asked by the govern-
ment of Norway, it was stated that “Facebook does not
use cookies to track people visiting websites using the Like
button” [37]. The current design of social plugins, as
provided by all major social networking services, com-
bined with empirical evidence [9], stresses the need for
changes so that words align with actions. We want to
believe that SNSs treat the privacy of their members as
an issue of the utmost importance, and we hope that they
are willing to ensure it through technical means.
In this paper, we have presented a novel design for
privacy-preserving social plugins, which provide exactly
the same user experience as existing plugins, and at the
same time prevent SNSs from being able to track the
browsing activities of their users. We have described in
detail how this design can be offered transparently as a
service to users of existing SNSs without the need to in-
stall any additional software, and thus envisage that it
could be adopted for the protection of their member’s
privacy. SafeButton, our proof-of-concept implemen-
tation of this design as a browser add-on for Firefox,
demonstrates the practicality of our approach. SafeBut-
ton is publicly available, and currently supports full con-
tent personalization in a privacy-preserving way and with
minimal space overhead for seven out of the nine so-
cial plugins offered by Facebook, while it loads them 2.8
times faster compared to their original versions.
