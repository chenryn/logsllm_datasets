User: The problem is still on the drawing board so far, so I can go for another better suited approach. The situation is like this:
We create a queue of n-processes, each of which execute independently of the other tasks in the queue itself. They do not share any resources etc. However, we noticed that sometimes (depending on queue parameters) a process k's behaviour might depend on existence of a flag specific to k+1 process. This flag is to be set in a DynamoDB table, and therefore; the execution could fails.
What I am currently searching around for is a method so that I can set some sort of waiters/suspenders in my tasks/workers so that they poll until the flag is set in the DynamoDB table, and meanwhile let the other subprocess take up the CPU.
The setting of this boolean value is done a little early in the processes themselves. The dependent part of the process comes much later.
Assistant: So, we went ahead with creating n number of processes instead of having a suspender. This would not be the ideal approach, but for the time being; it solves the issue at hand.
I'd still love a better method to achieve the same.
