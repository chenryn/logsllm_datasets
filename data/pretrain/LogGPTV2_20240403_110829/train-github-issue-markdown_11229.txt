When adjusting zone sizes, could the zone size (height & width) in pixels be
overlaid or somehow displayed on each zone? Very hard now to adjust zones by
eye, would be nice to have some numbers to look at so that I can make sure two
zones are the same width or height or whatever. Thanks, otherwise FancyZones
is great and really helping me get organized with my new 49" ultra wide
display.
