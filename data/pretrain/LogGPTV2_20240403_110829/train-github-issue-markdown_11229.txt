When adjusting zone sizes, could the dimensions (height and width) in pixels be overlaid or displayed on each zone? It is currently quite challenging to adjust zones by eye. Having numerical values would make it much easier to ensure that two zones have the same width, height, or other dimensions. Thank you for considering this. Otherwise, FancyZones is a fantastic tool and has been very helpful in organizing my new 49-inch ultra-wide display.
