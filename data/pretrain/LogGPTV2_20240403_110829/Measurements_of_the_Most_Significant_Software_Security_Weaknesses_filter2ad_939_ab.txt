### 4.1 Explanation of Mitigated Equation

Equation (8) computes the natural logarithm of the frequency \( F_i \). Equation (9) then takes the natural logarithm of the result from Equation (8) and multiplies it by a coefficient \( k \) (from Equation (7)). The coefficient \( k \) is used to normalize the resulting values between 0 and 1, aligning with the severity range in Equation (10).

These three equations transform the power-law-like frequency distribution into a more linear form, addressing the first limitation discussed in Section 3.1. This transformation is illustrated in Figure 4. Each point on the x-axis represents a Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE), ordered from least frequent to most frequent. The lower blue line represents the normalized frequency (i.e., the number of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) mapped to a particular CWE). The slow increase in frequency up to the 100th CWE, followed by a rapid increase, creates large differences between the most frequent CWEs and almost no difference between the least frequent ones. Applying a log function over the frequency should minimize these differences.

The middle yellow line in Figure 4 shows the effect of taking the log of the frequency, which helps to linearize the distribution but still results in an upward curve on the right side. Therefore, we apply a double log for further linearization, as shown by the top red line. This approach is not perfectly linear for the least frequent CWEs, but this is not a significant issue since our goal is to identify the most significant CWEs, which must have at least a moderate frequency.

Our modified MDSE equation (11) then multiplies the frequency and severity, similar to the original MDSE equation, but it uses two distributions that have a similar shape for the part of the functions that are of interest. This enables the MSSW equation to more fairly balance the evaluation of frequency and severity in scoring and ranking a CWE.

To address the second limitation from Section 3.2, Equation (10) normalizes the severity using the maximum and minimum mean severity values, giving the distribution a full 0 to 1 range, which is not achieved in the MDSE equation (5).

Equation (11) is our final modified MDSE equation, and we recommend its use in place of the published MDSE equation.

### 4.2 Analysis of Mitigated Equation

We conduct three experiments to evaluate the effect of the MSSW equation in making the frequency and severity distributions more similar and in producing top lists with more balanced inclusion of both frequency and severity. A fourth experiment involving correlation calculations is provided in Section 5.

#### 4.2.1 Risk Map Experiment

Figure 5 shows an MDSE risk map for the evaluated CWEs. Each red dot represents a CWE positioned according to its severity \( S_i \) and frequency \( F_i \). Generally, CWEs towards the upper right are more significant, and those towards the lower left are less significant. Note how the majority of the CWEs are clustered very close to the x-axis, indicating very small frequencies. The range of x-values is constrained from 0.37 to 0.97, even though normalization should make it from 0 to 1.

Figure 6 shows the same risk map using our double log frequency \( F''_i \) and modified severity \( S'_i \). The CWEs are now more uniformly spread over the y-axis, and the range of x-axis values is from 0 to 1. The MSSW equation, which combines frequency and severity using the values shown in Figure 6, will now more equally combine them than with the MDSE values shown in Figure 5.

#### 4.2.2 Set Difference Experiment

Figure 7 shows the size of the set difference between the MSSW top list and the severity top list (the mostly lower red line) and the set difference between the MSSW top list and the frequency top list (the middle yellow line). The red and yellow lines are much closer together than in Figure 1, and the red line does not hover close to 0 like it does in Figure 1. This demonstrates that the MSSW equation more evenly balances the inclusion of the top frequency and top severity CWEs.

Note that the goal is not to have the red and yellow lines match. The top list should not necessarily include an equal number of both top frequency and top severity CWEs. Our point with this analysis is to show how the MDSE equation almost exclusively chooses the top frequency CWEs, while our MSSW equation factors in CWEs from both sets. The next subsection will evaluate this more equal inclusion in more detail, focusing on top lists of size 20.

#### 4.2.3 Chosen CWE Experiment

Figure 8 shows the MSSW scores plotted against the double log frequency \( F''_i \) scores. Each point represents a CWE, and the red triangles indicate the CWEs chosen for the MSSW top 20 list. Unlike in the analogous Figure 2 for MDSE, many higher frequency CWEs are not chosen for the top 20 list due to their insufficient severity.

Figure 9 shows the MSSW scores plotted against the normalized mean CVSS score \( S'_i \) for each CWE. The range spreads from 0 to 1, unlike the analogous Figure 3 for the MDSE equation. The MSSW equation chooses CWEs for the top 20 list from CWEs with generally higher CVSS scores. However, it excludes many high severity CWEs because their frequencies were too low.

### 5 2019 Top 20 Lists of the Most Significant Weaknesses

We use our MSSW equation to generate lists of the most significant software security weaknesses. We choose a list size of 20, somewhat arbitrarily, to enable the lists to conveniently fit on a page. We performed the experiments on a variety of list sizes and did not discover any appreciable differences. We did not choose a size of 25 to match the CWE top list because we needed to produce two top lists of differing levels of abstraction to get the most accurate results (explained below) and thus were unable to produce a single list of 25 CWEs for an ideal comparison with the CWE top 25 list.

We follow the approach in [12] of separately providing a top list for CWEs of higher levels of abstraction (pillars and classes) and a top list for CWEs of lower levels of abstraction (bases, variants, and compounds). This was done in [12] to avoid errors in frequency calculations that exist in CWE’s top 25 list. The paper argues that CWEs mapped to lower level abstractions (e.g., bases) should also count towards their parent abstractions (e.g., classes); this is not done with MDSE calculations.

For example, class CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) is a parent of base CWE-1289 (Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input). If a vulnerability exists with CWE-1289, then CWE-20 also needs to be taken into account with the CWE frequency counts. However, when this frequency propagation is performed, combining together the two abstractions results in a single top list with a bias towards parents with many children (especially popular children). Thus, the two levels of abstraction need to be presented in separate top lists.

We will refer to the higher level abstraction list as the class list and the lower level abstraction list as the base list for convenience. We also follow [12] in using published CWE taxonomy views 1000 and 1008 (discussed in Section 2.3) to propagate CVE data from child CWEs to their parents. This provides a more accurate mapping of CVEs onto the CWEs, providing a more accurate data foundation upon which to apply our MSSW equation.

These modifications also alter the frequency and severity distributions, which could potentially render our double log function invalid. However, Table 1 shows correlation results for using and not using all combinations of the modifications adopted from [12]. It shows that the MDSE equation is highly correlated to frequency (.97 or higher) with very little correlation to severity (.25 or lower) regardless of the modifications used or not used. It also shows that the MSSW equation is strongly correlated to both frequency (.81 or higher with one exception) and severity (.66 or higher) regardless of the modifications used. Our one exception is for the class list using propagation with MSSW; even here, the frequency correlation was .55 (still strong but much less than the others).

Note that our objective is not for the correlations to necessarily be equal, but that there exists a strong correlation for both frequency and severity. Depending on the data, the higher frequency CVEs may or may not also be the highest severity CVEs. If so, then the correlations to frequency and severity would both be very high and almost equal. If not, both should still be high, but one may be higher than the other. What we do not want in these results is for one of frequency or severity to have a high correlation and the other to have a very low correlation (which can be seen with the MDSE equation).

We also checked to see that the double log still linearized the frequency distribution when using both variants from [12]. While propagating CVEs over the CWEs using the CWE taxonomies and using all applicable CWEs (i.e., pillars, classes, bases, variants, and compounds), the results show that the double log does still linearize the frequency (see Figure 10). The same results were obtained while performing the experiment using just the pillars/classes and then just the bases, variants, and compounds (graphs not shown).

Using our MSSW equation to aggregate the frequency and severity of CWEs, the top 20 class list for 2019 is shown in Table 2. The top 20 base list is shown in Table 3. These two lists use the modification from [12] where the CVEs are propagated up through the CWE taxonomies. We claim that these two lists represent the most accurate measurement yet produced for determining the most significant software security weaknesses. Given that there is no ground truth for how to best combine frequency and severity and no ground truth upon which to establish the correctness of the CVSS metric, it is likely impossible to prove any such metric as maximally effective. We make our 'most accurate measurement yet' claim based on the demonstrated limitations in the published MDSE equation and a lack of competing published alternatives.

### 6 Discussion and Analysis of the Most Significant Weaknesses

In this section, we evaluate our 2019 MSSW class and base lists (see Tables 2 & 3) and compare them against the 2019 CWE Top 25 MDSE List [17] (reproduced in Table 4).

As stated previously, we expect the MDSE list to vary from the MSSW class and base lists because:
1. The MDSE list is biased towards the frequency of a CWE occurring in CVEs.
2. We use the taxonomy propagation approach from [12].
3. The class and base lists contain a total of 40 CWEs, while the MDSE list contains 25 CWEs.

#### 6.1 High-Level Summaries

View 1003 contains two pillars (CWE-682 and CWE-697) and 36 classes, as well as 81 bases, three variants (CWE-415, CWE-416, and CWE-401), and two compounds (CWE-352 and CWE-384).

The MDSE Top 25 [17] ranks CWE items across all the layers of abstraction from view CWE-1003. The list has seven classes, 16 bases, one variant, and one compound. Interestingly, some of these top CWEs have child-parent relationships among themselves.

A simple inspection of the list shows how parent CWEs do not receive CVE counts from their children. For example, the count for the top class CWE-119 (rank 1, count 1048) does not include the counts of its children CWE-125 (rank 5, count 678) and CWE-787 (rank 12, count 473). Analogously, the count for the class CWE-287 (rank 13, count 299) does not include the counts of its children base CWE-798 (rank 19, count 91) and base CWE-295 (rank 25, count 77).

Our MSSW class list is comprised of 19 class CWEs and the pillar CWE-682 (rank 9) – see Table 2. Only three CVEs are directly associated with CWE-682, but it is included in the list due to its importance in the overall taxonomy.
