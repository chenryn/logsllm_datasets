4.1 Explanation of Mitigated Equation
Equation 8 takes the log of the frequency using the natural log as
the base. Equation 9 then takes the log of equation 8, again using the
natural log as a base and multiplies the result by k (from equation
7). The k coefficient serves the purpose of normalizing the resulting
values between 0 and 1 (to match the severity range in equation
10).
These three equations modify the power law like frequency
distribution to make it more linear, thus addressing limitation 1
(from Section 3.1). This can be seen in Figure 4. Each value on the
x-axis represents a particular CWE, ordered from least frequent
to most frequent. The lower blue line represents the normalized
frequency (i.e., number of CVEs mapped to a particular CWE). Note
the slow increase in frequency up to the 100th CWE, followed by
a rapid increase terminating in an almost vertical line (i.e. large
derivative). This behavior creates large differences between the
most frequent CWEs and almost no difference between the lowest
CWEs. If д(x) = log f (x) its derivative is
d f (x)
dx
= 1

,
thus applying a log function over the frequency should minimize
differences between the most frequent CWEs.
The middle yellow line represents taking the log of the frequency
(equations not shown), which helps linearize but still results in
an upwards curve on the right side. Thus, we apply a double log
for further linearization (see the top red line). We note that this
approach is not pseudo-linear for the most infrequent of CWEs.
However, this does not cause problems as our goal is to identify the
most significant and any such CWE must have at least a moderate
frequency.
Our modified MDSE equation 11 then multiplies frequency and
severity as in the original MDSE equation, but it multiplies from two
distributions that have a similar shape for the part of the functions
that are of interest. This enables the MSSW equation to more fairly
balance evaluating frequency and severity in scoring and ranking
a CWE.
To address limitation 2 from Section 3.2, equation 10 normalizes
the severity using the maximum and minimum mean severity values.
This gives the distribution a full 0 to 1 range which is not achieved
in the MDSE equation 5.
Equation 11 is our final modified MDSE equation. We recommend
its use in place of the published MDSE equation.

4.2 Analysis of Mitigated Equation
We now conduct three experiments to evaluate the effect of the
MSSW equation in making the frequency and severity distributions
more similar and in producing top lists with more equal inclusion
of both frequency and severity. A fourth experiment involving
correlation calculations is provided in Section 5 (because it includes
some variants introduced in that section).
4.2.1 Risk Map Experiment. Figure 5 shows an MDSE risk map for
the evaluated CWEs. Each red dot represents a CWE positioned
according to its Si severity and Fi frequency. In general, CWEs
towards the upper right are more significant and those towards the
lower left are less significant. Note how the majority of the CWEs
are squished very close to the x-axis as many have a very small
frequency. Also, the range of x-values is constrained from .37 to .97
(when the normalization should make it from 0 to 1).
Figure 6 shows the same risk map using our double log frequency
F ′′
i and our modified severity S′
i . Note how the CWEs are now more
uniformly spread over the y-axis. Also, the range of x-axis values is

now from 0 to 1. The MSSW equation that combines frequency and
severity using the values shown in Figure 6 will now more equally
combine them than with the MDSE values shown in Figure 5.
Set Difference Experiment. In Figure 7 we show the size of
4.2.2
the set difference between the MSSW top list and the severity top
list (the mostly lower red line). We also calculate the set difference
between the MSSW top list and the frequency top list (the middle
yellow line). Note how the red and yellow lines are much closer
together than in Figure 1 and how the red line does not hover close
to 0 like it does in Figure 1. This demonstrates that the MSSW
equation is more evenly balancing inclusion of the top frequency
and top severity CWEs.
Note that the goal is not to have the red and yellow lines match.
The top list should not necessarily evenly include an equal number
of both top frequency and top severity CWEs. Our point with this
analysis is to show how the MDSE equation almost exclusively
chooses the top frequency CWEs and how our MSSW equation
factors in CWEs from both sets. The next subsection will evaluate
this more equal inclusion in more detail, focusing on top lists of
size 20.
4.2.3 Chosen CWE Experiment. Figure 8 shows the MSSW scores
plotted against the double log frequency F ′′
scores. Each point
i
represents a CWE. The red triangles indicate the CWEs that were
chosen for the MSSW top 20 list. Note how unlike in the analogous
Figure 2 for MDSE, there are many higher frequency CWEs that
are not chosen for the top 20 list due to their severity not being
high enough.
Likewise, Figure 9 shows the MSSW scores plotted against the
S′
i normalized mean CVSS score for each CWE. Note how the range
spreads from 0 to 1, unlike the analogous Figure 3 for the MDSE
equation. Also note how the MSSW equation chooses CWEs for the
top 20 list from CWEs with generally higher CVSS scores. However,

apart from a list covering CWEs of lower levels of abstraction
(bases, variants, and compounds). This was done in [12] to avoid
errors in frequency calculations that exist in CWE’s top 25 list.
The paper argues that CWEs mapped to lower level abstractions
(e.g., bases) also should count towards their parent abstractions
(e.g., classes); this is not done with MDSE calculations. For example,
class CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) is a parent of base CWE-
1289 (Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input). If a
vulnerability exists with CWE-1289, then CWE-20 also needs to
be taken into account with the CWE frequency counts. However
when this frequency propagation is performed, combining together
the two abstractions results in a single top list with a bias towards
parents with many children (especially popular children). Thus the
2 levels of abstraction need to be presented in separate top lists.
We will refer to the higher level abstraction list as the class list
and the lower level abstraction list as the base list for convenience
and because both lists are primarily composed of either classes or
bases. We also follow [12] in using published CWE taxonomy views
1000 and 1008 (discussed in Section 2.3) to propagate CVE data
from child CWEs to their parents (discussed above). This provides
a more accurate mapping of CVEs onto the CWEs, providing a
more accurate data foundation upon which to apply our MSSW
equation.2
These modifications also alter the frequency and severity dis-
tributions which could potentially render our double log function
invalid. However, Table 1 shows correlation results for using and
not using all combinations of the modifications adopted from [12].
It shows that the MDSE equation is highly correlated to frequency
(.97 or higher) with very little correlation to severity (.25 or lower)
regardless of the modifications used or not used. It also shows that
the MSSW equation is strongly correlated to both frequency (.81 or
higher with one exception) and severity (.66 or higher) regardless
of the modifications used. Our one exception is for the class list
using propagation with MSSW; even here the frequency correlation
was .55 (still strong but much less than the others).
Note that our objective is not for the correlations to necessarily
be equal, but that there exists a strong correlation for both frequency
and severity. Depending upon the data, the higher frequency CVEs
may or may not also be the highest severity CVEs. If so, then the
correlations to frequency and severity would both be very high and
almost equal. If not, both should still be high but one may be higher
than the other. What we do not want in these results is for one of
frequency or severity to have a high correlation and the other to
have a very low correlation (which can be seen with the MDSE
equation).
We also checked to see that the double log still linearized the
frequency distribution when using both variants from [12]. While
propagating CVEs over the CWEs using the CWE taxonomies and
using all applicable CWEs (i.e., pillars, classes, bases, variants, and
compounds), the results show that the double log does still linearize
the frequency (see Figure 10). The same results were obtained while
2This propagation especially helps the formulation of the class list since most classes
have children. It has a lesser effect on the base list. Note that it is impossible to inverse
the propagation of data. CWEs are labelled as specifically as possible by NVD analysts
so CVEs described by pillar or class CWEs do not get reflected in the base list. It is
even possible that they shouldn’t because there may be unidentified bases missing
from view 1003 that are still covered by the view 1003 classes.

it excludes many high severity CWEs because their frequencies
were too low.
5 2019 TOP 20 LISTS OF THE MOST
SIGNIFICANT WEAKNESSES
We now use our MSSW equation to generate lists of the most
significant software security weaknesses. We choose a list size of
20, somewhat arbitrarily, to enable the lists to conveniently fit on a
page. We performed the experiments on a variety of list sizes and did
not discover any appreciable differences. We did not choose a size
of 25 to match the CWE top list because we needed to produce two
top lists of differing levels of abstraction to get the most accurate
results (explained below) and thus were unable to produce a single
list of 25 CWEs for an ideal comparison with the CWE top 25 list.
We follow the approach in [12] of separately providing a top
list for CWEs of higher levels of abstraction (pillars and classes)

then just the bases, variants, and compounds (graphs not shown).
Using our MSSW equation to aggregate the frequency and sever-
ity of CWEs, the top 20 class list for 2019 is shown in Table 2.
The top 20 base list is shown in Table 3. These two lists use the
modification from [12] where the CVEs are propagated up through
the CWE taxonomies. We claim that these two lists represent the
most accurate measurement yet produced for determining the most
significant software security weaknesses. Given that there is no
ground truth for how to best combine frequency and severity and
no ground truth upon which to establish the correctness of the
CVSS metric, it is likely impossible to prove any such metric as
maximally effective. We make our ‘most accurate measurement
yet’ claim based on the demonstrated limitations in the published
MDSE equation and a lack of competing published alternatives.
In this section, we evaluate our 2019 MSSW class and base lists
(see Tables 2 & 3) and compare them against the 2019 CWE Top 25
MDSE List [17] (reproduced in Table 4).
As stated previously, we expect the MDSE list to vary from the
MSSW class and base lists because:
(1) the MDSE list is biased towards the frequency of a CWE
occurring in CVEs,
(2) we use the taxonomy propagation approach from [12], and
(3) the class and base lists contain a total of 40 CWEs while the
MDSE list contains 25 CWEs.
6.1 High Level Summaries
View 1003 contains two pillars (CWE-682 and CWE-697) and 36
classes, as well as 81 bases, three variants (CWE-415, CWE-416, and
CWE-401), and two compounds (CWE-352 and CWE-384).
The MDSE Top 25 [17] ranks CWE items across all the layers
of abstraction from view CWE-1003. The list has seven classes, 16
bases, one variant, and one compound. Interestingly, some of these
top CWEs have child-parent relationships among themselves.
A simple inspection of the list shows how parent CWEs do not
receive CVE counts from their children. For example, the count for
the top class CWE-119 (rank 1, count 1048) does not include the
counts of its children CWE-125 (rank 5, count 678) and CWE-787
(rank 12, count 473). Analogously, the count for the class CWE-287
(rank 13, count 299) does not include the counts of its children base
CWE-798 (rank 19, count 91) and base CWE-295 (rank 25, count
77).
Our MSSW class list is comprised of 19 class CWEs and the
pillar CWE-682 (rank 9) – see Table 2. Only three CVEs are directly
