Hello,

I am new to this technology and have just started reading the Spring reference documentation in PDF format, including both the Current Development Releases and the Current GA Releases. Unfortunately, I have noticed that the images are not being downloaded with the PDF files.

Thank you in advance for your assistance.

Best regards,  
Jyothi Prakash
