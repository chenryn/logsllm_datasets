User: I need to be able to open a document using its default application in Windows and Mac OS. Basically, I want to do the same thing that happens when you double-click on the document icon in Explorer or Finder. What is the best way to do this in Python?
Assistant: os.startfile(path, 'open') under Windows is good because when spaces exist in the directory, os.system('start', path_name) can't open the app correctly and when the i18n exist in the directory, os.system needs to change the unicode to the codec of the console in Windows.
