## Problem
My team is maintaining a large front end application with the same file
hierarchy as:-
  * component
  * pages
but we don't like it. We usually have multiple component that is only used by
a single page resulting whenever we found bugs or wanted to modify a page, we
have to navigate though component to find the components related to the page.
Its a pain in developing. So, we prefer the approach of:-
  * pages 
    * page  
index.js
      * component  
and we are looking for a new framework to use
## Ideal case
We would name our pages and components differently
  * pages 
    * page  
index.page.js
      * component  
component.component.js
We would use pagesGlobPattern to only render files ending with .page.js
ignoring .component.js  
But then we would need another option to ask next to treat index.page.js as
index.js
