## Problem
Modern cryptography offers various schemes for protecting information at rest on devices and in transit among devices. A cryptographic scheme typically "scrambles" or "unscrams" information using a data-permutation algorithm and a short cryptographic key. The security of the scheme depends on the properties of the algorithm and the quality and secrecy of the key. Therefore, cryptographic keys need to be created and managed carefully, including their protection at rest and in transit.

Although many cryptographic schemes have been standardized and efficiently implemented in software and hardware, these solutions are not universally used or embedded in devices. The main reasons are the lack of generic, easy-to-deploy, and easy-to-use solutions for key management and the challenge of integrating various cryptographic and key management components into a holistically secure design. While individual cryptographic components may be known to be secure, there is no known recipe for integrating different components into secure designs that guarantee the security of keys and other information, both at rest and in transit. Major challenges and vulnerabilities often arise during this integration process.

## Solution
MIT Lincoln Laboratory developed SHAMROCK, a one-size-fits-many Intellectual Property (IP) core that integrates advanced key management technology and streaming encryption into a single component to protect data in transit. SHAMROCK is designed for low Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) applications and can be embedded into a wide variety of devices, enabling entire systems to be secured with the same component.

### Key Features
- **Advanced Key Management:** SHAMROCK provides comprehensive key management functionality, including key generation, storage, and distribution.
- **Streaming Encryption:** It uses standard encryption algorithms such as AES to secure data in transit.
- **Low SWaP:** Designed for efficient use in resource-constrained environments.
- **Versatile Integration:** Can be easily integrated into a wide range of devices and systems.

### Implementation and Performance Analysis
SHAMROCK has been realized as an IP core on two types of Xilinx FPGAs: Virtex-6 and Kintex-7. The key management protocols are implemented in C and executed on a Tensilica 106micro soft-core microcontroller. Figure 1 shows the dynamic power consumption on the Kintex-7 FPGA, which is significantly lower than that of the Virtex-6, especially for operations like Streaming AES.

#### Key Management Function Timings
- **FPGA@50MHz / CPU@72MHz:**
  - **Dynamic Power Consumption:** Typically, the dynamic power consumption is significantly less on the Kintex-7 compared to the Virtex-6, particularly for operations like Streaming AES.
  - **Performance Comparison:** Figure 2 depicts the performance of key management functions on the Kintex-7 and an ARM Cortex M3 microprocessor. The Kintex-7 generally performs these operations faster than the ARM Cortex M3.
