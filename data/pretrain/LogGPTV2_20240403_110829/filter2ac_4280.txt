### Title: Pre-built JOP Chains with the JOP ROCKET: Bypassing DEP without ROP

Return-Oriented Programming (ROP) has become virtually synonymous with code-reuse attacks in exploit development. However, there is an alternative method: Jump-oriented Programming (JOP). Until recently, there were no dedicated tools for JOP, unlike ROP, which benefits from a variety of robust tools such as Mona and ROPgadget. In fact, some experts even claimed that JOP had never been observed in the wild, although this is not true. There is a significant lack of practical information on how to perform JOP, and developing a pure JOP exploit without specialized tools would have been an enormous undertaking.

JOP was once a shadowy, elusive concept, but times have changed. The new JOP ROCKET, a reverse engineering and exploitation framework developed by Brizendine as part of his doctoral dissertation research, now makes JOP a feasible technique. The latest version of JOP ROCKET can generate pre-built JOP chains, which, under ideal conditions, require minimal user modification. With JOP ROCKET, you can develop JOP exploits that, similar to ROP, allow for the bypass of Data Execution Prevention (DEP) and other mitigations like Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR).

This talk aims to demystify the arcane and esoteric knowledge surrounding JOP. It delves into the technical details and challenges of performing JOP exploits, providing numerous examples and demonstrations. While JOP shares some similarities with ROP, it also has significant differences, and there are many non-obvious pitfalls. JOP is a challenging and non-trivial code-reuse attack, rarely discussed in the community. This talk will teach attendees how to use JOP ROCKET effectively.

A major update in JOP ROCKET is the ability to create pre-built JOP chains to bypass DEP using functions like `VirtualProtect()` or `VirtualAlloc()`. Although JOP exploit development can be complex, these pre-built chains simplify the process, making it more accessible to security researchers and practitioners.
