User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How to easily remember lots of different passwords? I know that you shouldn’t use the same password on every site. But, when you log into several dozen sites, keeping track of all the passwords can be pretty hard.

What system do you recommend that won’t compromise all my accounts when one site gets hacked (assume the worst case — site storing passwords in clear text)?

I am looking for a system that helps me remember the passwords, not a way to store them.

Assistant: To remember passwords, type them often. You can remember dozens of passwords if you type them daily -- that's muscle memory, the same kind which is used by martial arts practitioners, so remembering many passwords is like being a Kung fu master (albeit in a slightly less awesome way).

Bruce Schneier, well-known Chuck Norris imitator, recommends writing down your passwords and keeping them in your wallet. This makes sense because you are both trained and highly motivated at maintaining a high level of physical security on your wallet. I would double that with a copy of the same password sheet somewhere in your safe, so that you could recover from a wallet theft (i.e. logging again in all the sites and change your password). Also, a piece of paper has no battery which needs recharging.

(Caution: your smartphone is not a good wallet. Physical security on your phone is much lower than the one you apply on your wallet. Unless you are in the habit of flourishing your wallet at arm's length while walking in the street.)
