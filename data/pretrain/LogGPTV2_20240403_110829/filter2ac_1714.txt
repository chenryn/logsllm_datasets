**ATT&CK ID:** T1586  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Compromise Accounts

Adversaries may compromise accounts on various services to facilitate their targeting efforts. In operations that involve social engineering, the use of an online persona can be crucial. Instead of creating and cultivating new accounts (as in the "Establish Accounts" technique), adversaries may opt to compromise existing accounts. By leveraging a compromised persona, attackers can exploit any pre-existing trust or familiarity that potential victims may have with the account, thereby increasing the likelihood of success in their social engineering attempts.
