Abstract—Robocalls are inundating phone users. These au-
tomated calls allow for attackers to reach massive audiences
with scams ranging from credential hijacking to unnecessary
IT support in a largely untraceable fashion. In response, many
applications have been developed to alert mobile phone users
of incoming robocalls. However, how well these applications
communicate risk with their users is not well understood. In this
paper, we identify common real-time security indicators used in
the most popular anti-robocall applications. Using focus groups
and user testing, we ﬁrst identify which of these indicators most
effectively alert users of danger. We then demonstrate that the
most powerful indicators can reduce the likelihood that users
will answer such calls by as much as 43%. Unfortunately, our
evaluation also shows that attackers can eliminate the gains
provided by such indicators using a small amount of target-
speciﬁc information (e.g., a known phone number). In so doing,
we demonstrate that anti-robocall indicators could beneﬁt from
signiﬁcantly increased attention from the research community.
I.
INTRODUCTION
the combination of deregulation,
Robocalls are overwhelming phone users. Long existent
but relatively rare,
inter-
connectivity of telephony networks and a lack of end-to-end
authentication has recently made it simple and inexpensive to
send such calls untraceably at very large scale. This problem
continues to grow almost entirely unabated, and it is believed
that nearly 50% of all calls in 2019 will be robocalls [1].
While regulatory mechanisms to combat robocalls exist [2],
the volume of such calls has only continued to grow rapidly.
The technical community has responded by creating a number
of anti-robocall applications for mobile devices. These applica-
tions generally rely on centrally manicured blacklists, and have
collectively been downloaded by over tens of millions of users.
However, the efﬁcacy of these applications and, speciﬁcally,
how well users understand and respond to the indicators they
present for incoming calls is currently unknown. As such, it
is clear users want to avoid spam calls but unclear if anti-
robocall applications are an effective means of alerting users
and modifying their behavior.
In this paper, we evaluate the impact of interface design el-
ements on user decision-making for anti-robocall applications.
Our goal is not only to determine if anti-robocall applications
can reduce the number of malicious/nuisance calls answered by

users, but also whether the answering rate can be improved for
legitimate calls given additional guarantees about a caller’s
identity. This distinction is critical, as the sheer volume of
such calls is forcing many to simply stop answering calls or
abandon the platform for voice communications altogether [3].
Our work begins by examining the ten most popular
of anti-robocall applications for Android and identifying the
prominent visual elements used to alert users of the nature of
an incoming call. We then assemble focus groups to discuss
how users currently attempt to screen robocalls, to identify
which elements in current applications most unambiguously
alert them to the presence of such calls, and then ask them for
the features they wish to see in such applications. Finally, we
develop ﬁve applications, a control, two based on the strongest
indicators identiﬁed in current applications and two more
based on the requested indicators, and demonstrate that both
applications lower the percentage of robocalls from unknown
numbers answered by users. Unfortunately, we then show that
adversaries can erase the gains provided by these applications
by spooﬁng meaningful numbers (which are easily gathered
from sources such as social media or sold by advertisers),
unless Authenticated Caller ID is in place.
This paper makes the following contributions:
•
Survey of Current Applications: The anti-robocall
application space has grown rapidly and with little
coordination, leading to a wide array of indicators
(ranging from emojis such as a ‘thumbs down’ and
a cartoon octopus to backgrounds spanning the range
of the color spectrum). To our knowledge, we are the
ﬁrst to systematically characterize these indicators.
Identify Strongest Current Indicators: We recruit
six focus groups and three interviewees to provide
feedback on current robocall indicators. These groups
noted signiﬁcant confusion regarding lock symbols,
but identiﬁed the international prohibition sign and
checkmark symbol favorably. Moreover,
the focus
groups also indicated that
they would like to see
warnings accompanied by an alerting color covering
the entire screen (but not red).
•
• Moderate Positive Behavioral Change: We con-
ducted an interactive study to evaluate the effective-
ness of warnings for robocalls. We show a 43% de-
crease in answered calls when a spam call warning is
present. However, we then demonstrate that attackers
can largely eliminate these positive behavioral changes
by calling from a number known to the callee (e.g.,
a family member, their bank, etc), unless Authenti-
cated Caller ID is in place. Finally, we show that
using Authenticated Caller ID increases the number of
users that answer non-malicious calls from unknown
numbers by 15%.
This work does not attempt to judge the quality of the
blacklists powering anti-robocall applications, nor is it a total
ranking of speciﬁc apps. Instead, we seek to characterize how
users respond to the robocall alerts that accompany them.
As such, we believe that our approach attempts to capture
a “best-case” approximation of interface effectiveness. Iden-
tifying effective indicators has proven extremely challenging
historically. The browser community, for instance, spent well
over two decades refactoring their indicators to best alert
users of danger [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]. Anti-robocall
interfaces introduce new challenges. Speciﬁcally, decisions to
answer phone calls are real-time (unlike visiting a website,
where a user could potentially take an arbitrarily long time
before proceeding), and because most carriers lack the ability
to strongly authenticate Caller ID. Accordingly, determining
whether or not an incoming call is a robocall is a related, but
new challenge in secure interface design.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows:
Section II provides critical background information about
robocalls and Caller ID spooﬁng; Section III describes our
assumptions about the adversaries; Section IV evaluates the
current state of the art in robocall detection app interfaces;
Section V details the feedback from our focus groups to
identify the most critical elements of alerting interfaces; Sec-
tion VI shows how users reacted to robocalls using three
different interfaces; Section VII provides additional discussion
and insight; Section VIII details related work; and Section IX
provides concluding remarks.
II. BACKGROUND
The global telephony infrastructure includes cellular net-
works, Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), and the Public
Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) (Figure 1). These net-
works are connected via gateways, which allow calls made
in one network to reach endpoints in other networks. Each
technology generates its own associated metadata; however,
we cannot guarantee that any of this data can be delivered
end-to-end except voice and Caller ID, neither of which is
authenticated.
Even though some devices authenticate directly to their
provider network, the ability to conﬁrm identity beyond one’s
provider does not exist. Robocallers and telemarketers take ad-
vantage of the ability to call anyone while claiming an arbitrary
identity. Traditionally, telemarketing companies have depended
on a collection of numbers to deliver unsolicited information
through the PSTN. However, solely using the PSTN to make
multiple calls can be difﬁcult and costly. Telemarketers and
robocallers now largely use autodialers and VoIP services to
inject calls. VoIP generally provides the cheapest means of
making calls and a simpler way to spoof Caller ID. In many
of these systems, a user can choose the name and number
shown on the Caller ID since that information originates from
the client side in that protocol. The ability to change Caller ID
information allows robocalls to appear as a familiar or trusted
contact.
Fig. 1. A high-level overview of the global telecommunications infrastructure.
The PSTN, VoIP, and Cellular Network make up the infrastructure. Different
devices rely on each network but can communicate with each other through
gateways. Robocalls take advantage of the lack of end-to-end authentication
and low cost to ﬂood this infrastructure with calls.
Both the increase of robocalls and limited robocall pre-
vention have prompted research to understand the threats [11],
[12], [13] and solutions from heuristics to cryptography [14].
Solutions include using Caller ID (assuming no spooﬁng),
black or whitelisting [15], call back veriﬁcation [16], content
and audio analysis [17], [18], chatbots [19], provider-based
solutions (e.g., SHAKEN/STIR [20], Authenticated Caller
ID [21], [22]), end-to-end solutions (e.g., AuthentiCall [23],
[24]), and mobile applications that implement some of these
solutions. This work investigates the use of mobile applications
and evaluates the warning designs being used to alert users of
incoming robocalls.
Since some end-to-end solutions include Authenticated
Caller ID, this feature was also included in the designs tested.
End-to-End Authenticated Caller ID stems from the work
of Reaves et. al, [23], [24] where an application can verify
that a caller is who they claim to be by cryptographically
authenticating both parties. For this work, Authenticated Caller
ID is the presence of Caller ID information that has been
veriﬁed.
III. THREAT MODEL
We assume an adversary as similar as possible to real-world
robocallers.
Robocallers are able to place a large number of low-cost or
free phone calls. This adversary does not have special access to
a provider core network; rather, they rely on either disposable
phone numbers [25], a simbox [26], or alter call meta-data
to “spoof” the source of the call (i.e., Caller ID spooﬁng).
Attackers select their targets via multiple strategies including
enumerating the address space, web scraping, purchasing con-
tact information from advertising networks, or directly from
social media.
With the above-described abilities, an adversary could
decide to call from either a random number, a number with
a small edit-distance from their target (e.g., Caller: 999-555-
1234; Receiver: 999-555-1235), or even from a trusted institu-
tion (e.g., the Internal Revenue Service, a ﬁnancial institution)
or someone within the target’s social network (e.g., a parent
or grandparent).
We assume that call blacklists accurately identify malicious
calls. We aim to test whether or not currently deployed user
interface elements effectively alert users.

IV. SURVEY OF ANTI-ROBOCALL APPLICATIONS
We begin with a study of the state-of-the-art
in anti-
robocall applications. Because these efforts have been without
any central planning or standardization, it is critical that we
characterize the wide array of techniques already in place.
A. App Selection
Figure 2 shows screenshots of the applications evaluated
in our study. All of the anti-robocall apps selected from the
Google Play store 1) appeared as a search result for spam call
blocker in October 2018, 2) were free to download, 3) had an
average rating of at least four stars, 4) had at least one million
downloads, and 5) were not designed by a telephone carrier.1
Based on the order Google Play presented the search results,
the ﬁrst 10 applications were chosen. The privacy policy,
website and Google Play page of each app were analyzed to
determine how the robocall apps identify spam calls and alert
users of spam calls.
B. Results
The apps that met our requirements in October of 2018
are shown in Figure 3, which also includes the icons, star
rating, number of installs, and the abbreviations used to help
differentiate them in this paper.
Of these ten apps, A2 is the only application that is solely
focused on call blocking and does not provide a warning
for incoming calls. Accordingly, this application will not be
discussed further.
1) Robocall Identiﬁcation Method:
In addition to using
lists, many applications rely on Caller ID, publicly available
lists, and community comments to identify robocalls and phone
spam. A1’s privacy policy and website do not fully detail how
blocked numbers are handled. However, it does mention that
their global blacklist is comprised of data from sixty sources.
A3 identiﬁes spam using complaint information provided by
FCC, FTC, IRS, State of Indiana and their community of
users. The remaining applications do not specify exactly where
their database information comes from, but they do state that
they build their database based on the spam calls detected
by their community of users. Finally, A4 and A9 state in
their privacy policy that users’ contacts could potentially be
added to the organization’s database. We mention robocall
identiﬁcation methods in this design paper for completion.
Further investigation of app accuracy and reliability is left for
future work.
2) Warning Design: The warning designs used for each
application were analyzed using Wogalter’s warning design
guidelines [27]. We focus on wording, layout, placement, and
pictorial symbols. Salience and personal factors are a part of
the guidelines but were not considered because they require
feedback from users.
Wording. Wogalter states that a warning should consist of
four components - signal word, identiﬁcation of hazard, expla-
nation of consequences, and directions for avoiding the hazard.
Each app’s warning met those requirements by including words
that “attract attention” and identify the hazard. Words such
as robocall, spam or fraud help bring the user’s attention to
the type of call they are receiving. Users download the apps
because they know the hazards of answering spam calls and are
using the app to avoid them. Therefore, installing and using the
app addresses the hazard consequence and avoidance criteria.
Also, community-based apps A4, A5, and A9 often present the
hazard’s consequence within the wording of the warning. For
example, an app alert might be, “Previously reported ﬁnancial
scam,” which would let the user know that if they answer and
comply with the call, they could become a victim of a ﬁnancial
scam. When the spam alert provides these details, additional
information may not be necessary to communicate the possible
consequence.
Layout & Placement. Each app’s warning design is
included in Figure 2. The most popular design includes a
rectangle in the middle of the screen that overlays the incoming
call screen. The majority of the warnings include white text
over a red background and a symbol to indicate an alert is
being expressed.
Pictorial Symbols. Pictorial Symbols are used in each app
to convey the warning message. A6, A7, and A10 use warning
messages that include symbols that are often displayed to
demonstrate or bring attention to an issue. A8 uses its company
logo, a green octopus with a red background, which is shown
in Figure 2h, as the spam call warning symbol. When using A8,
the user will need to read the fourth line of the warning to see
that the call is categorized as a spam call if they misunderstand
the meaning behind the octopus.
C. Discussion
The results show that the majority of the apps use the color
red in a rectangular warning screen overlay and place their
warning in the middle of the screen. A8 displays a lot of in-
formation closely together, and providing too much or cluttered
information can effect warning detection [28]. The user would
need to read the four lines to ﬁnd the call’s category, possibly
making it difﬁcult for the user to easily and quickly interpret
the warning. The inclusion of the octopus logo as a symbol
in A8 is unique and might become helpful over time as the
user has more experience with the app, but an octopus is not
among the symbols often used and most recognized by users
as an indicator of an alert or warning [29], [30]. All of the
apps except A8 meet the warning design guidelines by using
clear wording, symbols, and placing warnings where the user
can see them.
However, meeting Wogalter’s criteria is only the ﬁrst step
in creating an effective warning. As mentioned in previous
work [31], [32], [7], warnings should be tested and adjusted
for the speciﬁc danger it is being created to alert.
1This information is based on the result from 2018. Since then, Should I
Answer? has been updated and uses a new icon and interface. Also, Hiya and
Mr.Number have a similar warning design because they were created by the
same company. However, both applications were popular thus landing them
on our list.
V. USER EXPERIENCE COLLECTION
After identifying the spam call warning design elements
used in anti-robocall applications, we conducted focus groups
to understand user experiences with robocalls and identify

Fig. 2. Each application, as shown above, displayed warning design examples on their respective Google Play store pages. Most (80%) of the apps use the
color red to indicate an incoming spam call. A6 and A7 use similar warning designs because they were created by the same company. A2 only blocks calls and
does not show a spam warning, so its blocking options are shown in this Figure instead.
