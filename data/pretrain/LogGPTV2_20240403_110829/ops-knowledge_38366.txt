User: How to use common pipeline commands in Unix systems to connect multiple commands and scripts in series so that they can complete complex tasks?
Assistant: Common pipeline commands in Unix systems include: pipe character (|), redirection character (>, >>, <), command separator (;), etc. Use the pipeline command to chain multiple commands and scripts together, making it possible to complete complex tasks. Commonly used methods are: 1. Use the pipe character (|) to connect multiple commands, and use the output of the first command as the input of the second command. For example: ``` ls -l | grep ^d | awk '{print $9}' > dirlist.txt ``` This command will list the files and folders in the current directory, then filter out the folders through grep, and then Output the folder name through awk, and finally save the result to dirlist.txt. 2. Use redirection characters (>, >>, <) to redirect the output or input of a command to a file or other command. For example: ``` cat myfile.txt | sort | uniq > newfile.txt ``` This command reads the contents of myfile.txt, sorts them by sort, removes duplicates by uniq, and finally saves the result to newfile.txt. 3. Use the command separator (;) to connect multiple commands and let them be executed in sequence. For example: ``` cd /path/to/mydir; ls -l ``` This command will first enter the directory /path/to/mydir, and then list the file list under this directory. By using these pipeline commands reasonably, we can connect multiple commands and scripts in series to complete more complex tasks.
