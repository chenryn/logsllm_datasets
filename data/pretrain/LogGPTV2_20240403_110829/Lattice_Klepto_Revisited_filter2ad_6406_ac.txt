y-coordinate with x-coordinate fixed, it would be very efficient for
the attacker to recover the whole point.
4.2 Our Backdoor for NewHope
We now describe a subverted key generation algorithm (Algorithm
8) for NewHope’s key generation (Algorithm 1) along with the
attacker’s decryption (Algorithm 9).
In Algorithm 8, an analogy of the elliptic curve-based Diffie-
Hellman key exchange scheme is employed as the embedded public
key scheme. In fact, the attacker plays the role similar to Bob in
the key exchange process who takes a random integer Y as his
secret key and computes Y P as his fixed public key (but not choose
a random Y for every time as in the key exchange process), while
the backdoor acts like Alice who produces seeda = X P which will
be leaked to the attacker, and computes the final secret XY P as
the seed to generate the private key of NewHope. Note that here
we just use the x-coordinate of the points instead of all the two
coordinates, which coincides with the key generation algorithm of
NewHope as in Algorithm 1.
Algorithm 8 Subverted NewHope Key Generation
Require: System parameters: dimension n, modulus q,
error distribution ψ, attacker’s pk = (P, P0 = Y P)
Ensure: key pairs (pk, sk)
1: sample random integer X ←(cid:45) Zp
2: compute P1 = X P, P2 = X P0
3: let seeda = P1,x , and let seeds = P2,x
4: use seeds to generate s, e ←(cid:45) ψ
5: use seeda to generate a ←(cid:45) U(Rq)
6: compute b = a ⊛ s + e
7: return pk = (seeda, b), sk = s.
Obviously, the attacker can multiply X P by his private key Y to
get XY P, and then generate the secret key of NewHope. However,
since only the x-coordinate of X P is known to the attacker, he needs
do some additional computations to recover the correct XY P.
More precisely, by retrieving the RLWE public key, the attacker
knows seeda = P1,x . As described above, for him there are two
possibilities for P1’s y-coordinate and for the exact P1. He multiplies
two alternatives for P1 by Y and takes the x-coordinates, and tests
them to find the exact seeds by regenerating s, e and checks if
b = a ⊛ s + e.
Algorithm 9 Attacker’s recovery for seeds
Require: seeda
Ensure: s
1: compute points P
2: compute P
3: test and find the actual seeds from x1 and x2
4: use seeds to generate s, e ←(cid:45) ψ

Remark 2. In fact, we can also just use seeds to generate s ←(cid:45) ψ,
but generate e normally in the Subverted RLWE Key Generation
algorithm. When checking the correct Y , we regenerate s, and check
if b − a ⊛ s is short enough.
4.3 The Quality of Our Backdoor
In this subsection we demonstrate the strong undetectability of our
backdoor.
Compared to the algorithm substitution attack on symmetric
schemes by Bellare et al. [3], where the strong undetectability is
reduced to the security of pseudo random generators, we make the
reduction to DDH assumption in the following. Now the Decision
Diffie-Hellman assumption on elliptic curves states that it is hard
to distinguish a sample of form (Y P, X P, XY P) from a sample of
form (Y P, X P, ZP), where P is the generator of an elliptic curve,
and X, Y , Z are independently uniformly random integers over Zp.
We make our statement below.
Theorem 4.1. The subverted RLWE encryption with algorithm 8 as
key generation algorithm is strongly undetectable under the Decision
Diffie-Hellman assumption.
Proof. Suppose D is a probabilistic polynomial-time detector
which takes a scheme and outputs 1 if it decides the scheme is our
subverted scheme, and 0 otherwise. We define 1/2 + ϵ(n) as the
probability that D makes the right decision. Our goal is to show
ϵ(n) = negl.
Now we define an algorithm A for the Decision Diffie-Hellman
problem, i.e., it takes as input a curve with generator P, and samples
of triples of points (P0, P1, P2) on the curve, whose values are
(P0, P1, P2) =
(cid:26) of half chance (Y P, X P, ZP), where (X, Y , Z) ∼ U(Z3
p)
of half chance (Y P, X P, XY P), where (X, Y) ∼ U(Z2
p)
and it tries to output 0 in the first case and 1 in the second case to
the best of its ability.
In detail, the algorithm A runs as follows:
,

Algorithm 10 Algorithm A for DDH Problem Using Detector D
Require: An elliptic curve with generator P,
points P0, P1, P2 as described above
Ensure: a bit b ∈ {0, 1} representing the guess for the DDH prob-
1: set P1,x as seeda, and P2,x as seeds
2: use the seeds to run the rest of key generation, feed D the
output key pair
3: D returns a bit b′
4: let b (cid:66) b′, return b
We analyze the behavior of A. If (P0, P1, P2) = (Y P, X P, ZP) with
p), what D is fed is a healthy scheme, while
(X, Y , Z) ←(cid:45) U(Z3
when (P0, P1, P2) = (Y P, X P, XY P) with (X, Y) ←(cid:45) U(Z2
p), D takes
a subverted scheme with exactly our backdoor. Hence the chance
for A to make the right decision equals to that for D, which is
1/2 + ϵ(n). Now by the Decision Diffie-Hellman assumption, we
have
ϵ(n) = A’s advantage over DDH = negl.
□
Compared to other works about designing a kleptographic back-
door on lattice-based crypto schemes, our backdoor is theoretically
undetectable and closer to Young and Yung’s definitions. We use
formal proof for the analysis of backdoor, which may become a
more helpful tool in kleptographic research.
4.4 Other Possible Constructions
The key step in the backdoor algorithm above is to use a PKC
mechanism to leak seed for secret key exclusively for the attacker.
Following this route there can be many other ways to construct such
backdoors which may have even no need to affect the production
of seeds. For example, if the public key exposed to the attacker is
supposed to be (a, b) as in a more "standard" RLWE-based scheme
[9, 12], where a has much larger size, then the attacker may sample
seeds normally, produce a secret ciphertext for it and set this secret
ciphertext as a. Since the size of a is much larger, another RLWE
encryption with suitable parameters (say, with a halved n) can be
chosen as the secret encryption. The strength of this choice is that
it makes the backdoor follow a post-quantum setting, as what Xiao
and Yu achieved in [19].
Another solution for the backdoor not affecting the production
of secret key is to take an ECC ciphertext of seeds and then hide
it in the least significant bits of b in public key. This approach is
assumed to be safe for the attacker since both the LSBs of b and the
bits in secret ciphertext are close to uniform.
The latter method is actually a subliminal channel – besides
seeds, the attacker is able to leak any (short enough) message sub-
liminally in this way. Formally, a subliminal channel is a secret
channel for a communication hidden inside a compromised channel.
It was introduced by Simmons [15–18]. We also note that Galteland
and Gjøsteen [4] gave a survey on subliminal channels on the NIST
post-quantum signature schemes.
5 CONCLUSION
In this paper we revisited a kleptographic backdoor for an NTRU
encryption scheme and introduced several methods against it. From
what we presented, an NTRU encryption scheme seems more resis-
tant to a kleptographic attack. The simultaneously algebraic and
geometric restrains on the NTRU primitives make it challenging to
embed a backdoor without apparent flaws.
We also present a feasible algorithm to backdoor the RLWE-
based scheme, showing the danger of such kleptographic attacks
against the lattice-based schemes.
