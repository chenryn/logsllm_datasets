each group and a varying number of the total slots read. As be-
fore, this experiment shows the mean of 100 iterations of the ex-
periment for each point and provides 95% conﬁdence intervals two
orders of magnitude smaller than the mean. This approach provides
signiﬁcant savings over the standard MIPNet architecture. Specif-
ically, if a client only reads ﬁve messages during each round (e.g.,
three conversations and polls for two additional conversation re-
quests), each round takes an average of 484.43 and 546.32 ms for
ng = 50, 100, respectively. Because users are not constantly typ-
ing, the slightly slower processing to input speed here is unlikely
to signiﬁcantly impact perception of throughput for this applica-
tion. Note the longest delay to deliver a message (i.e., from client i
to client i − 1) has also been greatly reduced in this conﬁguration
to approximately three seconds. Given that the average user types
between 19 and 33 words per minute [36], or one character every
333.3 to 526.3ms, our infrastructure is capable of processing char-
acters faster than the majority of users enter them for all but one of
the above cases.
These values indicate that the MIPNet architecture is capable of
supporting applications with some tolerance to delay (e.g., chat).
We will show the practicality of additional applications including
email in our future work.
5.4 Performance Comparison
We conduct one ﬁnal set of experiments to measure the total per-
formance improvement over the naïve use of the underlying cryp-
tographic primitives. Speciﬁcally, we recreate the MIPChat client
without any of the optimizations discussed in this work (e.g., RSA-
OT, groups, etc) and simply compile our circuits using an unmodi-
ﬁed version of the Fairplay compiler and execute them in the “ba-
(cid:2)(cid:1)
sic” architecture.
Unfortunately, this most basic comparison was not possible be-
cause the Fairplay compiler exceeded the 1GB memory maximum
set by the Java virtual machine. Accordingly, we compiled our cir-
cuits using only the OBDD compiler but without any additional
optimizations. For n = 100, we recorded 50 iterations of the pro-
tocol and observed an average time of 35.626 seconds, with a 95%
conﬁdence interval of ±0.161 seconds. The performance proﬁle
of our optimized MIPChat client provides a reduction in execution
time of 98.5%. This dramatic improvement over the naïve appli-
cation of SFE primitives demonstrates that our optimizations and
careful parameterization can allow these constructions to form the
basis of a system with near real-time performance requirements.
6. CONCLUSION
We present Mix-In-Place Networks (MIPNets), an architecture
built on Secure Function Evaluation that replaces multiple interme-
diary nodes with a cascade of functions in a single proxy. Through
the use of SFE, this proxy remains oblivious to the source, desti-
nation and content of all messages exchanged within the system.
We demonstrate that our proposed architecture provides provable
deniability and then, through extensive performance analysis using
a number of optimizations that dramatically reduce the execution
time (greater than 98%), demonstrate the practicality of this ap-
proach for applications with near real-time requirements, including
instant messaging for as many as 100 clients. Finally, we discuss
a number of enhancements to potentially further improve the per-
formance, scalability and robustness of our architecture. In so do-
ing, we have not only demonstrated the practicality of using a sin-
gle node to mix trafﬁc with provable properties, but also shown
that SFE can address a void in the anonymous communications
space for applications with moderate performance constraints and
no guarantees of adequate cross trafﬁc.
