## Abstract
Face authentication is a promising biometric-based user authentication mechanism widely available in the era of mobile computing. With built-in cameras on smartphones, tablets, and laptops, face authentication provides a convenient alternative to traditional passwords due to its memory-less process. Although it has inherent vulnerabilities to spoofing attacks, it is generally considered sufficiently secure for common access protection. However, the security of face authentication is increasingly questioned due to the widespread sharing of personal images on online social networks (OSNs). The large volume of personal images shared daily on platforms like Facebook, Google+, and Instagram can be accessed by potential adversaries, creating a significant threat known as OSN-based facial disclosure (OSNFD).

In this paper, we make the first attempt to quantitatively measure the threat posed by OSNFD. We examine real-world face authentication systems designed for smartphones, tablets, and laptops. Our results show that while the percentage of vulnerable images that can be used for spoofing attacks is moderate, the percentage of vulnerable users subject to such attacks is high. Specifically, the average percentage of vulnerable users is 64% for laptop-based systems and 93% for smartphone/tablet-based systems. This evidence suggests that face authentication may not be suitable as an authentication factor, as its confidentiality has been significantly compromised by OSNFD.

To better understand the characteristics of OSNFD, we develop a risk estimation tool based on logistic regression. This tool extracts key attributes affecting the success rate of spoofing attacks and helps users calculate risk scores for their shared images, thereby increasing their awareness of OSNFD.

## 1. Introduction
Online social networks (OSNs) have become an essential part of modern social life. Platforms like Facebook, Google+, and Instagram are used extensively for sharing experiences and personal data, including images. According to a recent report by Facebook, 350 million personal images are published daily [40]. These images often contain clear facial images, making them a valuable resource for potential attackers. This phenomenon, known as OSN-based facial disclosure (OSNFD), poses a significant threat to face authentication systems.

Face authentication, a biometric-based user authentication mechanism, is widely available on consumer-level devices such as smartphones, tablets, and laptops. Popular systems include Face Unlock [10], Facelock Pro [8], and Visidon [38] on smartphones/tablets, and Veriface [24], Luxand Blink [25], and FastAccess [39] on laptops. These systems offer an attractive alternative to traditional passwords, requiring no memorization and typically having higher entropy than easy-to-guess passwords [28].

Previously, the main obstacle for adversaries was the need for physical proximity to capture a victim's facial images. However, with OSNFD, this requirement is no longer necessary. The availability of abundant exploitable resources compromises the confidentiality of face authentication, which is a fundamental requirement for authentication [14, 18]. 

In this paper, we provide the first quantitative measurement of the threat posed by OSNFD against face authentication. We investigate real-world face authentication systems designed for smartphones, tablets, and laptops. Our study collects users' facial images from OSNs and simulates spoofing attacks against these systems. Despite the closed-source nature and lack of programmable testing interfaces in target systems, we build a dataset containing important image attributes that are common in real-life photos but rarely used in prior controlled studies [6, 13].

Our findings indicate that although the percentage of vulnerable images is moderate, the percentage of vulnerable users is high. On average, 64% of users are vulnerable in laptop-based systems, and 93% in smartphone/tablet-based systems. The quality of images is a more significant factor affecting the success rate of spoofing attacks than the quantity. A user who uploads a few clear facial images is more vulnerable than one who uploads many low-quality images.

To further understand the characteristics of OSNFD, we develop a risk estimation tool using logistic regression. This tool achieves a precision of 81%, a recall of 83%, and an F1 score of 82% on average. It helps users evaluate the risk of uploading an image by calculating a risk score based on extracted attributes, thereby increasing their awareness of the threat.

The contributions of this paper are:
- We investigate the threat of OSNFD against face authentication, suggesting that face authentication may not be suitable as an authentication factor due to the significant compromise of its confidentiality.
- We provide the first quantitative measurement of the threat of OSNFD by testing real-world face authentication systems and building a dataset containing important image attributes.
- We use logistic regression to extract key attributes affecting the success rate of spoofing attacks and develop a risk estimation tool to help users measure the risk score of uploading images to OSNs.

## 2. Preliminaries

### 2.1 Face Authentication
Face authentication is a biometric-based user authentication mechanism that verifies a user's identity using information extracted from their facial features. A typical face authentication system captures a user's facial image or video, processes it through face detection and matching modules, and compares it with enrolled biometric information. The system accepts or rejects the input based on a similarity score and a predefined threshold, balancing false rejection and false acceptance rates.

### 2.2 OSN-based Facial Disclosure and Threat Model
OSN-based facial disclosure (OSNFD) refers to the involuntary disclosure of users' face biometrics through the sharing of personal images on OSNs. This disclosure raises security risks for face authentication systems, which are vulnerable to spoofing attacks where adversaries replay captured facial images or videos. While liveness detection technologies can mitigate this threat, they are often weak and disabled by default in many popular face authentication systems.

## 3. Data Collection and Empirical Analysis

### 3.1 Data Collection
We conducted a user study involving 74 participants, including 36 males and 38 females aged between 19 and 35, primarily students from our university. Each participant was compensated with $10. The study was conducted in a quiet room and consisted of three parts:

1. **Image Selection**: Participants selected and downloaded 20 facial images published within the last 12 months on popular OSNs. Images were evaluated for various negative effects such as blur, occlusion, and head rotation.
2. **Controlled Image Capture**: We captured participants' facial images with 35 controlled head poses and 5 facial expressions using a Canon EOS 60D DSLR camera. A helmet equipped with a gyroscope was used to control head rotation, ensuring accuracy and consistency.
3. **Questionnaire**: Participants filled out a questionnaire to collect their attitudes towards face authentication and sharing behaviors on OSNs.

These classifications represent three major factors affecting the effectiveness of OSNFD-based attacks: security settings, target platforms, and user behaviors. We use them as controlled parameters to evaluate the severity of OSNFD and conduct more sophisticated statistical analysis to identify key attributes that can mitigate the threat.
