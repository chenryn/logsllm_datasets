User: I am not sure if I searched for the wrong terms, but I could not find much on this subject. I am on osx and I'd like to compile a commandline python script into a small commandline app, that I can put into usr/local/bin so I can call it from anywhere. Is there a straighforward way to do that?
Thanks
Assistant: On Unix it works usually in the following way:

Put #!/usr/bin/env python in the first line of your .py script.
Add execution permissions to the file (using chmod).
Execute the script from command line, eg. by providing ./my_script.py when in the same directory.

What else do you need?
