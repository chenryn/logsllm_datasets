User:  Please explain how to build a simple web application using the Express framework in Node.js.
Assistant: The following are the steps to build a simple web application using the Express framework: 1. Install Node.js and the Express framework. 2. Create a new project folder and enter it at the command line. 3. Run the "npm init" command to create a new "package.json" file. 4. Run the "npm install express --save" command to add the Express framework as a dependency. 5. Create a new JavaScript file in the project folder, for example "app.js". 6. In the "app.js" file, use the following code to import Express and other required modules: ```javascript const express = require("express"); const app = express(); const port = 3000; `` ` 7. In the "app.js" file, use the following code to set up the routing of the application: ```javascript app.get("/", (req, res) => { res.send("Hello World!" ); }); ``` 8. In the "app.js" file, use the following code to start the server: ```javascript app.listen(port, () => { console.log(`Server is running at http ://localhost:${port}`); }); ``` 9. Run the "node app.js" command on the command line to start the server. 10. Open the browser, enter "http://localhost:3000", and you can see the output of "Hello World!". The above are all the steps to build a simple web application using the Express framework.
