User: I have a project where I use erlang to aggregate RSS, and I use python to process the RSS feeds.
Method 1:
Use an erlang port, using erlport.org, to call python.
   I'm not sure how to design the python code to be asyncrhonous using erlport.
Method 2:
Use erlang to call on a RESTful interface with Tornado that does the processing (asynchro downloading of urls -- asynchro procssing)
Assistant: I haven't worked Erlang<->Python before but erlport.org seems promising. I would try that first before getting into greasiness with REST and what not. I.e. I didn't provide and answer but a recommendation :)
