Tooltips are consistently displayed at the top, regardless of their initial configuration. This issue also affects the main demo, which can be viewed at the following link: <http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/javascript.html#tooltips> 

For clarity and professionalism, it might be better to rephrase it as follows:

"The tooltips are always positioned at the top, irrespective of their original configuration settings. This behavior is also evident in the primary demonstration, accessible via this link: <http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/javascript.html#tooltips>."
