### User Retention and Follower Loss Post-Compromise

**Figure 6: User Retention Post-Compromise**
- **Description:** This figure compares the user retention of compromised accounts to a random sample of Twitter users. We find that 40% of compromised accounts were inactive in the last month, compared to only 17% of random accounts.

**Figure 7: Change in Follower Counts Post-Compromise**
- **Description:** This figure illustrates the change in follower counts for compromised accounts compared to a random sample of Twitter users. Our results show that 57% of compromised accounts lose followers post-compromise, while only 18% of random accounts experience a similar loss.
- **Insights:** While we cannot conclusively determine if this is a direct result of compromise, one possible explanation is that compromised victims may have been part of a fake follower scheme, leading to a reduction in follower counts when they or other participants leave the program.

### Controlling Hijacked Accounts

Criminals generate spam tweets from hijacked accounts through two primary methods:
1. **Direct Access:** Using the victim's username and password, browser, or cookie (30% of spam tweets).
2. **OAuth Tokens:** Through applications with valid OAuth tokens (70% of spam tweets, originating from over 9,900 different applications).

**API Abuse:**
- **Finding:** Platform abuse via the API significantly contributes to the control of compromised accounts.
- **Recommendation:** Improved API safeguards, such as detecting anomalous application installs and near-duplicate content, can help reduce the spread of compromise.

### Social Nature of Compromise

#### 5.1 Social Contagions

**Connectivity Analysis:**
- **Methodology:** We measure the connectivity of infected users and meme participants to understand how compromise spreads along the social graph.
- **Results:**
  - 88% of contagions exhibit connectivity between victims, with an average of 56% of compromised users having at least one compromised neighbor.
  - These contagions account for 95% of all spam tweets sent by compromised accounts.
  - The remaining 12% of compromised clusters are composed entirely of singleton infections, which may be tied to password guessing, database dumps, or external contagions.

**Comparison with Memes:**
- **Finding:** 76% of retweeted memes share an edge with a participating friend, indicating that 74% of compromised users share at least one relation with another victim.
- **Conclusion:** There is a strong tendency for victims to be connected, though we cannot definitively say whether the majority of compromise spreads within Twitter.

#### 5.2 Influence of Compromised Neighbors

**Influence Measurement:**
- **Methodology:** We measure the probability \( p(i|k) \) that a user becomes infected given they have \( k \) previously infected neighbors.
- **Results:**
  - The probability of a user becoming compromised increases from 0.1% with one neighboring infection to 1% with 20 neighboring infections.
  - This behavior is nearly identical to the spread of memes, indicating that compromised victims are influenced by their peers.

**Implications:**
- **Conclusion:** Compromise occurs as a social process where users are vulnerable to the bad decision-making of their neighbors. Early outbreak detection in social networks is critical to prevent the spread of infections.

#### 5.3 Seeding Compromise Diffusions

**Initial Cascade Effect:**
- **Finding:** 35% of compromise campaigns rely on more than 100 fake accounts to start the infection process, with 25% of these accounts tweeting within 24 hours of the onset.
- **Hypothesis:** For the remaining 65% of campaigns, criminals may obtain a small number of compromised accounts through targeted attacks or by purchasing them from the underground, then compromising the victimâ€™s friends to start a cascade.

### Summary

Our findings highlight the significant impact of social contagions on the spread of compromise in online social networks. Improved API safeguards and early detection mechanisms are essential to mitigate the spread of compromised accounts.
