**Describe the problem**  
Some of the tests don't compile because of the incorrect order of parameters
and cause the following error:  
`sorry, unimplemented: non-trivial designated initializers not supported`
Problem is caused by the order in designated initializer which is different
from the order in struct.
How should be tensorflow tested so that this test passes? It even doesn't pass
on official Google tensorflow images.  
**Provide the exact sequence of commands / steps that you executed before
