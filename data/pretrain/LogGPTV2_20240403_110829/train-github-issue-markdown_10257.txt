I am currently using Bootstrap in an ASP.NET application and have found it to be extremely useful. However, I encountered an issue that I managed to resolve, but I would like to get some feedback on my solution to ensure there are no potential problems.

### The Issue
In ASP.NET, the framework requires that there is only one `<form>` tag with the `runat="server"` attribute for the code-behind functionality to work correctly. Initially, I was using multiple `<form>` tags on a single page, but since only one can have the `runat="server"` attribute, only the controls within that form were enabled for code-behind processing.

### My Initial Solution
My first attempt was to wrap multiple `<form>` tags inside a single enclosing `<form>` tag. However, this approach caused issues because nested `<form>` tags are not valid HTML. Browsers, such as Firefox, ignored the nested forms, leading to incorrect rendering and styling.

### Final Solution
To address this, I used a single enclosing `<form>` tag with the `runat="server"` attribute and then used `<div>` elements to group the controls. For example:

```html
<form runat="server" class="form-horizontal">
    <div class="form-group">
        <label class="control-label col-sm-2" for="input1">Input 1:</label>
        <div class="col-sm-10">
            <asp:TextBox ID="input1" runat="server" class="form-control"></asp:TextBox>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="form-group">
        <label class="control-label col-sm-2" for="input2">Input 2:</label>
        <div class="col-sm-10">
            <asp:TextBox ID="input2" runat="server" class="form-control"></asp:TextBox>
        </div>
    </div>
</form>
```

This approach seems to work well, and I have tested it in Firefox, Chrome, and Internet Explorer with good results.

### Question
Is there any problem with using the `class="form-horizontal"` on `<div>` elements instead of `<form>` tags? It appears to be working fine so far, but I am not a CSS expert, so I want to make sure there are no hidden issues or best practices I should be following.

Thank you for any insights or advice!
