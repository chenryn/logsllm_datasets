I am using bootstrap in an asp.net app, and absolutely loving it. I ran into
an issue, which I solved .. but I really wanted to know if anyone sees any red
flags with my solution.
The issue is, asp.net demands that there is one
tag, with attribute runat="server" for their code behind stuff to work
properly. I was using multiple 's on a page, but as only one can exist with
attribute runat="server" (or asp.net errors out) only the controls within the
one would get enabled for code behind.
My first solution was to wrap multiple 's in one enclosing but nested form
tags create a problem, as HTML validation actively rejects them, and they were
ignored (by firefox) and my styling went awry. (looked at view source and DOM
after render, only parent was regarded)
So I did this .. I used one and only one enclosing , and then used div's
instead of forms for control grouping . .eg ...
...
...
.. and everything seems to look and work just fine. (left out row and span
divs for brevity)
so my question is .. is there any problem with using
.. specifically using class "form-horizontal" with div's. .. it works fine as
far as i can tell so far, and I tried firefox/chrome/IE with good results ..
but i'm no CSS expert so i'm concerned.
