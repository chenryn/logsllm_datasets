**Bug summary**

  * Issue #3517 on Github
  * This and this on stack exchange
Here I used sinhala as Indic Script instance.  
I think the font family has to do something with this issue since output to
different font families are different. I'm not an expert in these stuff. Help
appreciated to to get this work even with a different font family.  
An example is given below for which I've tried with 3 different font families.  
**Code for reproduction**
    from matplotlib import rc
    families = ['WARNA','LKLUG','Arial']
    for familyname in families:
        rc('font', family=familyname)
        from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
        import numpy as np
        r = np.linspace(0.1,5,100)
        A = 3*2/(r*2)+np.pi*r**2
        fig = plt.figure()
        axes = fig.add_axes([.1,.1,.8,.8]) 
        axes.plot(r,A)
        axes.set_ylabel(u'වර්ගඵලය')
        axes.set_xlabel(u'අරය')
        axes.set_title(familyname)

**Expected outcome**
Result 1 looks fine but it has 2 problems:
  * Accents not been placed in the correct location. ("්" in "වර්ගඵලය" is placed after "ර" not before)
  * Letter "A" is not renderd in the title "WARNA"
Issues in result 2:
  * Same previous accent issue
  * Axis values or title not shown at all
Issues in result 3:
  * No Sinhala script shown.
