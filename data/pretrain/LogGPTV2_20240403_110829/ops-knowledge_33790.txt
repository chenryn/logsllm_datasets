User: Use bash scripts to write an automated deployment script that can automatically detect code updates and deploy them to the server.
Assistant: The following is a simple bash script example to automatically detect code updates and deploy to the server: #!/bin/bash # Set the variable LOCAL_DIR="/path/to/local/directory" REMOTE_DIR="/path/to/ remote/directory" REMOTE_HOST="remote-hostname-or-IP" # Check local and remote code updates cd $LOCAL_DIR git pull ssh $REMOTE_HOST "cd $REMOTE_DIR && git pull" # Copy files to remote host rsync -rv $LOCAL_DIR/ * $REMOTE_HOST:$REMOTE_DIR # restart the server application ssh $REMOTE_HOST "service application restart" # complete echo "Deployment complete." Please note that this script assumes your code is stored in a git repository and your application on the remote host The program has a named service, and you have configured ssh keys on both the local and remote hosts to enable passwordless authentication. You need to customize and modify the script according to the actual situation.
