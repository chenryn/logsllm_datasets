This github issue is meant to track the big roadmap items ahead of use and for
the community to provide ideas, feedback, steer and comment
## Lineage Annotations
Airflow knows a lot about your job dependencies, but how much does it know
about your data objects (databases, tables, reports, ...)? Lineage annotations
would expose a way for users to define lineage between data objects explicitly
and tie that to tasks and/or DAG. The framework may include hooks for
programatic inference (HiveOperator could introspect the HQL and guess table
names and lineage), and a way to override or complement these. The framework
will most likely be fairly agnostic about your data objects, letting you
namespace them however you want, and simply consider them as an array of
parent/child relationship between strings. It may be nice to use dot notation
and reserve the first part of the expression to `object_type`, allowing for
color coding in a graph view and tying actions (links) and the like. This will
course ship with nice graph visualization, browsing and navigation features.
## Picklin'
stateless/codeless web servers and workers
## Backfilll UI
Trigger a backfill from the UI
## REST API
Essentially offering features similar to what is available in the CLI through
a REST API, there may be some automagic solutions here that can figure out how
to build REST specs from argparse, it would also insure consistency between
the two
# [done!]
## Continuous integration with Travis-CI
Systematically run all unit tests against CDH and HDP on Python 2.7 and 3.5
## Externally Triggered DAGs
Airflow currently assumes that you run your workflows on a fixed schedule
interval. This is perfect for hourly, daily and weekly jobs. When thinking
about "analytics as a service" and "analysis automation", many use cases are
more of the "on demand" nature. For instance if you have a workflow that
processes someone's genome when ordered to, or a workflow that builds a
dataset on demand for data scientists based on parameters they provide, ....
This requires a new class of DAGs that are triggered externally, not on a
fixed schedule interval.
