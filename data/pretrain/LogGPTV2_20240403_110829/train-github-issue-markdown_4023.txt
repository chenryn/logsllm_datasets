The documentation explains how to use a specific file or directory of
certificates to trust, but I cannot find how to make it simply trust the
system set (for the current system). With older versions of requests this was
the default, which made it rather easy to install some extra intranet root
certs on all sorts of different machines (different Linux flavours, OSX,
possibly even Windows) and have the intranet certs be trusted by everything
from browsers to requests-based programs. It is unclear how to get this
behaviour with the current version of requests and certifi.
