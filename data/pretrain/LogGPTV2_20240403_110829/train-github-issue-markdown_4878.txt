I apologize in advance if this issue has already been reported. My concern is primarily related to the aesthetics of the notifications, as there are no functional problems. When I attempt to create a notification manually using `new Notification("abc")`, an alert box appears instead of the expected notification. This does not appear to be an operating system issue, as commands like `$ notify-send abc xyz` and other applications generate notifications as expected.
