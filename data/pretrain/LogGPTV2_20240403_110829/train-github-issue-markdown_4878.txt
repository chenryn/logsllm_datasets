Apologies in advance if this is a duplicate.
This is more about the aesthetics of the notifications (functionally, no
problems). Even when I try to create them manually with `new
Notification("abc")`, I get an alert box instead of the notification one.
This does not seem like an OS issue as `$ notify-send abc xyz` and other
applications give notifications as expected.
