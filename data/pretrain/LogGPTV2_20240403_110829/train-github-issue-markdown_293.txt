My request is to have functionality to be able to initialize a vector of size
`N` and type `T` using the `Vector(T, N)` command. This would be equivalent to
the current `Array(T, N)`. The reason for this is that it if I have a function
taking a `Vector` argument it feels nice to create the vector I send in to the
function using a `Vector` constructor. Same for matrices.
I tried to implement it myself like this (and in some other ways) but it is
not working:
    Base.call{T}(::Vector{T}, size::Int) = Array(T, size)
