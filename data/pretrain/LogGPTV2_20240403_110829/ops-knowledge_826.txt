Question: "A web developer is configuring a session identifier cookie for a secure web application on 'secureapp.example.com'. The cookie should not be accessible via JavaScript, must only be sent for requests to the 'secureapp.example.com' domain, should not be sent along with cross-origin requests, and must offer robust defense against CSRF attacks. Which of the following Set-Cookie header configurations would best achieve these requirements?"
 "A": "Set-Cookie: SECURESESSID=abc123; Domain=secureapp.example.com; Path=/; Secure; HttpOnly; SameSite=Strict"
 "B": "Set-Cookie: SECURESESSID=abc123; Path=/; Secure; SameSite=None"
 "C": "Set-Cookie: SECURESESSID=abc123; Expires=Fri, 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT; Domain=example.com; Path=/; HttpOnly"
 "D": "Set-Cookie: SECURESESSID=abc123; Domain=secureapp.example.com; Path=/; Secure; SameSite=Lax"
