User: Please describe what is load balancing, and the common strategies and implementation methods of load balancing.
Assistant: Load balancing is a technology for distributing workloads in a computer system or network. It can evenly distribute network traffic and computing loads to multiple servers to improve system performance and reliability. Load balancing can reduce the load pressure on a single server by distributing the load to multiple servers, thereby improving the fault tolerance and processing performance of the entire system. Common load balancing strategies include: 1. Round robin load balancing strategy: Assign requests to different servers in a fixed order. This strategy is simple and easy to implement, but may result in some servers being overloaded while others are idle. 2. Weight load balancing strategy: assign different weights to each server, and requests will be distributed according to the weight of each server. This strategy can use server resources more efficiently, but needs to predict the load situation of each server in advance. 3. Least connection load balancing strategy: allocate requests to the server with the least number of current connections. This strategy better balances server load, but may cause some servers to be overwhelmed. 4. IP hash load balancing strategy: assign requests to specific servers according to the requested IP address. This load balancing strategy ensures that every request is sent to the same server, which improves cache utilization, but can result in some servers being overloaded while others are idle. Ways to achieve load balancing include: hardware load balancer, software load balancer and DNS load balancer. A hardware load balancer is usually a specialized physical device that can distribute requests to multiple servers according to different load balancing strategies. A software load balancer is a software-based load balancing strategy that usually runs on one server in a server cluster. DNS load balancing uses the DNS domain name resolution mechanism to achieve load balancing and distribute requests to different IP addresses or domain names.
