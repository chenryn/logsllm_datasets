User: When multiple web applications are installed on the server, how to prevent data leakage and cyber-attacks between different applications?
Assistant: Data leaks and network attacks between different web applications can be prevented through the following aspects: 1. Divide subnets: deploy different web applications in different subnets to isolate them from each other and reduce the attack surface. 2. Configure the firewall: configure the firewall on the server, set different ports and rules, limit the network traffic of different web applications, and prevent attackers from exploiting some public vulnerabilities to attack. 3. Authority control: Different authority controls are performed on different web applications to ensure data security and privacy. Limit the file and directory access rights of web applications to ensure the isolation of files and data between web applications. 4. Data encryption: Encrypt sensitive data in web applications to avoid leakage. 5. Timely upgrades: Different web applications have different vulnerabilities and security risks. Upgrade and update software and plug-ins in web applications in a timely manner to prevent known vulnerabilities from being exploited by attackers. Regularly conduct security scans and tests on web applications, and fix potential security problems in a timely manner.
