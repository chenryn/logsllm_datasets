### Configuring IIS to Block Direct IP Access

**Problem:**
You want to configure IIS to block direct IP access to your server, as this type of access is often used by malicious scanners that scan the internet for vulnerable servers. You have already observed suspicious activity in your error logs, such as attempts to access `/MyAdmin/scripts/setup.php`.

**Solution:**
To block direct IP access and ensure that only requests with valid hostnames are served, you can use the URL Rewrite feature in IIS. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide:

1. **Open the URL Rewrite Feature:**
   - Open the Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager.
   - Select your website or application from the left-hand tree view.
   - In the middle pane, double-click on the "URL Rewrite" icon.

2. **Add a New Rule:**
   - Click on "Add Rule(s)" in the right-hand Actions pane.
   - Select "Request Blocking" as the rule template.

3. **Configure the Rule:**
   - **Rule Name:** Enter a descriptive name, such as "Block Direct IP Access".
   - **Match Type:** Select "Matches the Pattern".
   - **Pattern:** Leave this field empty, as we will be using conditions to block the requests.
   - **Conditions:** Add a condition to block requests based on the hostname.
     - **Condition Input:** `{HTTP_HOST}`
     - **Check if input string:** `Does Not Match the Pattern`
     - **Pattern:** `^yourdomain\.com$` (Replace `yourdomain.com` with your actual domain name)
   - **Action Type:** Select "Abort the request".

4. **Save and Apply:**
   - Click "Apply" in the right-hand Actions pane to save the rule.

### Example Configuration
Here is an example of how the rule might look in the `web.config` file:

```xml
<configuration>
  <system.webServer>
    <rewrite>
      <rules>
        <rule name="Block Direct IP Access" stopProcessing="true">
          <match url=".*" />
          <conditions>
            <add input="{HTTP_HOST}" pattern="^yourdomain\.com$" negate="true" />
          </conditions>
          <action type="AbortRequest" />
        </rule>
      </rules>
    </rewrite>
  </system.webServer>
</configuration>
```

### Additional Notes:
- **Performance Considerations:** While this method is effective, it may introduce a small performance overhead due to the additional processing required for each request. However, the impact is generally minimal.
- **Testing:** After configuring the rule, test it thoroughly to ensure that legitimate requests with the correct hostname are still being served, while direct IP access is blocked.

This configuration should help you secure your server against unauthorized access via direct IP addresses. If you have any further questions or need more assistance, feel free to ask.
