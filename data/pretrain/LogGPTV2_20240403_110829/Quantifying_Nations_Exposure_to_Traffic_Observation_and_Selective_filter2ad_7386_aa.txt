Abstract. Almost all popular Internet services are hosted in a select set
of countries, forcing other nations to rely on international connectivity to
access them. We identify nations where traﬃc towards a large portion of
the country is serviced by a small number of Autonomous Systems, and,
therefore, may be exposed to observation or selective tampering by these
ASes. We introduce the Country-level Transit Inﬂuence (CTI) metric
to quantify the signiﬁcance of a given AS on the international transit
service of a particular country. By studying the CTI values for the top
ASes in each country, we ﬁnd that 34 nations have transit ecosystems
that render them particularly exposed, where a single AS is privy to
traﬃc destined to over 40% of their IP addresses. In the nations where
we are able to validate our ﬁndings with in-country operators, our top-
ﬁve ASes are 90% accurate on average. In the countries we examine, CTI
reveals two classes of networks frequently play a particularly prominent
role: submarine cable operators and state-owned ASes.
1 Introduction
The goal of this study is to identify instances where a signiﬁcant fraction of
a country’s inbound international traﬃc is managed by a select few networks.
Such networks are in a position to observe and tamper with a nation’s traﬃc,
as could any third-parties who inﬁltrate them (e.g., using a phishing attack or
a remote vulnerability exploitation). For instance, observation—of unencrypted
traﬃc and metadata—may be performed by domestic or foreign actors with the
purpose of conducting surveillance or espionage, respectively. Conversely, selec-
tive tampering—for instance, with individual network ﬂows carrying popular-
application traﬃc—has been reported by actors that are both domestic (e.g.,
government censorship) and foreign (e.g., dis-information campaigns).
Because actual traﬃc information is diﬃcult to obtain at a global scale, we
instead quantify the fraction of a country’s IP addresses exposed to tampering

and observation by speciﬁc networks. While all IP addresses are clearly not
created equal, they facilitate an apples-to-apples comparison across nations, and
the ranking of networks inﬂuencing a particular country. Traﬃc towards any
given IP address is frequently handled by so-called transit networks, i.e., those
who sell connectivity to the rest of the Internet to other, customer networks for
a fee; customers include consumer-serving access networks.
These transit networks are often unknown and unaccountable to end users.
This opacity may allow both domestic and foreign actors to observe or tamper
with traﬃc—capabilities we term transit inﬂuence—without facing diplomatic
or political backlash from governments, activists or consumer groups. We aim to
bring transparency to the public regarding oversized observation and tampering
capabilities granted to speciﬁc transit networks in a large group of nations.
In order to reveal these crucial, nation-level topological features, we develop
the country-level transit inﬂuence (CTI) metric. CTI quantiﬁes the transit inﬂu-
ence a particular network exerts on a nation’s traﬃc. Studying transit inﬂuence
requires an analysis of the global routing ecosystem which enables networks to
exchange traﬃc between them. We extract information from the Border Gateway
Protocol (BGP), the central system by which networks exchange interconnec-
tion information. CTI is based on an analysis of a large compendia of BGP
data [8,54] and includes both topological and geographic ﬁlters designed to
facilitate inference despite incomplete and biased data [25,31,48].
We apply CTI in countries that lack peering facilities such as Internet
exchange points (IXPs) at which access networks might connect directly with
networks of other nations. In these transit-dominant nations, transit networks—
often a select few based in geographically distant countries [16,28,32,58]—serve
as the dominant form of connectivity to the global Internet. Moreover, the lack of
internationally connected, domestic co-location facilities places these nations at
further risk of exposure to observation and tampering because popular content
is generally hosted abroad [19,26,37,51,60].
We employ a two-stage approach based on a comprehensive set of passive
inference and active measurements. First, we identify transit-dominant coun-
tries. Countries that are transit dominant may be more exposed to observation
and tampering by transit providers than countries where peering agreements are
prevalent: the latter can receive some traﬃc from other countries through such
peering agreements and bypass transit providers. Second, we quantify the tran-
sit inﬂuence of the networks serving each country using the CTI methodology,
the central contribution of this study. We validate our ﬁndings from both stages
with in-country network operators at 123 ASes in 19 countries who each conﬁrm
that our results are consistent with their understanding of their country’s net-
works. These discussions, and our analyses showing the metric’s stability, lend
conﬁdence to our inferences despite the considerable technical challenges in this
measurement space.
In addition to releasing our code and data, our contributions include:
1. A new Internet cartography metric that quantiﬁes the transit inﬂuence a par-
ticular network exerts on a nation’s traﬃc: the country-level transit inﬂuence
(CTI) metric, which ranges over [0, 1].

2. We apply CTI to infer the most inﬂuential transit networks in 75 countries
that rely primarily on transit for international connectivity. These countries
have, in aggregate, ≈1 billion Internet users (26% of the world [2]). We ﬁnd
that many of these countries have topologies exposing them to observation or
tampering: in the median case, the most inﬂuential transit network manages
traﬃc towards 35% of the nation’s IP addresses.
3. We identify two classes of ASes that are frequently inﬂuential: those who
operate submarine cables and companies owned by national governments.
Ethical Disclaimer. We acknowledge several ethical implications of our work.
Our mass (validation) survey of operators was classiﬁed as exempt by our IRB.
Our reporting of available paths to repressive countries might trigger government
intervention to remove such paths. Another potential issue is the identiﬁcation
of networks that would yield the most expansive observation or tampering capa-
bilities in a country, which is potentially useful information for a malicious actor.
We believe most governments and sophisticated attackers already have access to
this information, and that our study may lead to mitigation of these concerning
topological features; thus, the beneﬁts signiﬁcantly exceed the risk.
Roadmap. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. We start in Sect. 2
with a high-level overview of our methodology before describing how we assign
nationality to preﬁxes, ASes, and BGP vantage points (Sect. 3). We introduce
the CTI metric in Sect. 4. We apply CTI in 75 countries where international
connectivity is predominantly transit and describe our ﬁndings in Sect. 5. Then,
we discuss in detail how we identiﬁed the transit-dominant countries (Sect. 6). We
present our validation with operators and stability analyses in Sect. 7. Section 8
discloses some limitations of our study while Sect. 9 compares with prior work.
Due to space constraints, we include further details and a ﬂowchart summarizing
our full methodology in the appendix. We release the CTI code and datasets at
https://github.com/CAIDA/mapkit-cti-code.
2 Approach Overview
Conceptually, international Internet traﬃc crosses a nation’s border at some
physical location, likely along a link connecting two routers. For our purposes,
we are not interested in the physical topology, but the logical one: in which
autonomous system(s) does international traﬃc enter a nation on its way to
access networks in that country (i.e., origin ASes). Topologically, these ASes
can have two diﬀerent types of relationship with the ﬁrst domestic AS encoun-
tered: transit (provider-to-customer or p2c) or peering (peer-to-peer or p2p).
We focus on countries where international connectivity is dominated by transit
(p2c) interdomain relationships as they are easier to identify from public data
sources.
High-Level Model. We look for evidence of a country’s exposure to observation
or selective tampering by speciﬁc networks. Studying this exposure requires a
648
A. Gamero-Garrido et al.
quantitative model of the reliance of the country’s access networks, in aggregate,
on speciﬁc transit networks. The model must factor in the size of the address
space originated by each AS with presence in the country. Intuitively, the greater
the share of a country’s IP addresses that are served by a particular transit AS,
the higher the potential exposure of the nation’s inbound traﬃc to observation
or tampering by that AS. The model must then produce a country-level metric of
exposure for each transit network serving the nation. To that end, we determine
the frequency at which transit networks appear on routes towards the country’s
IP addresses.
We start our model by building a graph where nodes are ASes and edges are
connections between them, weighted by address space. Then, a metric of node
prominence on said graph provides a quantitative assessment of how frequently
a (transit) node ASt is traversed when delivering traﬃc from any given node
to edge (origin) nodes. The higher the value of this metric for any ASt in a
given country, the more exposed the transit ecosystem is. At one extreme (most
exposed) are countries with a single transit provider (e.g., a legally-mandated
monopoly) connecting every network in the country to the rest of the Internet; at
the other end are countries with many transit providers, each delivering traﬃc to
a small fraction of the nation’s IPs. Note that we do not need complete visibility
of the graph (e.g., backup links) to infer potential exposure to observation or
tampering, as traﬃc will likely ﬂow through the links that are visible given
capacity constraints on long-haul (incl. international) links [14,44,50,67].
Our technical approach to build this conceptual model using real data uses
as inputs a combination of two types of measurements: (i) passive, to study
AS-level connectivity, and (ii) active, to study transit dominance.
AS-Level Connectivity. We rely on two major input sources: BGP paths
and preﬁxes from RouteViews [8] and RIPE RIS [6], and AS relationship infer-
ences from CAIDA. We begin with the 848,242 IPv4 preﬁxes listed in CAIDA’s
Preﬁx-to-Autonomous System mappings derived from RouteViews [22], exclud-
ing the 6,861 (0.8%) preﬁxes with (invalid) length greater than 24, and the 9,275
(1.1%) originated by multiple ASes. We ﬁnd those preﬁxes in the 274,520,778
IPv4 AS-level paths observed in BGP table dumps gathered by AS-Rank [1]
from RIPE/RouteViews [6,8] during the ﬁrst ﬁve days of March 2020. We con-
sider the set of preﬁxes and the ASes that originate them on each observed path
in combination with the 377,879 inferred AS-level relationships published by
CAIDA [5].1
Transit Dominance. Because we are focused only on countries where
transit—as opposed to peering—is the main form of trans-border connectiv-
ity, we use active measurements to identify and exclude nations with evidence
of foreign peering, i.e., where an AS that originates addresses geolocated to the

two clique ASes, clique being the AS-level core of the Internet inferred by [5]);
additionally, all paths towards these countries are seen at least once per day across
all ﬁve days.

country establishes a peering agreement with another AS primarily based in
another country2. We conduct a two-week-long active measurement campaign
(see Sect. 6.2) in May 2020 to determine which countries are transit dominant
based on the business relationship between the “border” ASes traversed by our
probe packets while entering the country (as inferred by BdrmapIT [49]).
3 Deﬁnitions of Nationality
CTI hinges on the correct nationality assignment for IP address preﬁxes and
BGP monitors. ASes are also assigned a nationality in the transit-dominance
analysis. Given the diverse set of information available, we devise distinct meth-
ods for each. (We include an analysis of CTI stability given an alternative geolo-
cation input in Sect. 7.) For our purposes, a country is one of the 193 United
Nations member states, either of its two permanent non-member observer states,
or Antarctica.
Address Preﬁxes. We ﬁrst geolocate each IP address in every observed
BGP preﬁx to a country using Netacuity [12]. Then, on a country-by-country
basis, we count how many addresses in each preﬁx are geolocated to that country.
If the number is less than 256 (a /24), we round up to 256. If Netacuity does not
place any of a preﬁx’s IP addresses in a country, we attempt to ﬁnd a delegation
block from the March 2020 RIR delegation ﬁles [7] that covers the entirety of
the preﬁx. If there is one we assign all of the delegated preﬁx’s addresses to
the indicated country. Hence, while Netacuity can place a preﬁx in multiple
countries, at most one country will receive addresses through the RIR process,
and only if it was not already associated with the preﬁx through Netacuity.
Netacuity accounts for 95.1% of all preﬁx-to-country mappings, while delegation-
derived geolocation accounts for the rest.
A particularly pressing concern with geolocation is the correct assignment of
IP addresses belonging to large transit ASes with a presence in many countries.
We compute the fraction of a country’s address space that is originated by ASes
that have at least two thirds of their addresses in that country. In the vast
majority of countries, the address space is dominated by ASes that are primarily
domestic.
BGP Monitors. As our study is focused on measuring inbound country-
level connectivity, we seek to limit our analysis to paths going towards addresses
in the target country from a BGP monitor located outside that country. Hence,
we conﬁrm the BGP monitor locations listed by RouteViews [59] and RIPE
RIS [57] through a set of active measurements. The details of this process are
included in Appendix A.
Autonomous Systems. Our transit dominance analysis relies on a con-
cept of AS nationality, which is based on IP geolocation of the AS’ originated
addresses; for transit providers, we also include the IP addresses originated by
