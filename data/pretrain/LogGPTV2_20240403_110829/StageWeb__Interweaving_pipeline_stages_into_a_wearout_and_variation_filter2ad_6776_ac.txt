**Interconnection Configurations in SW Systems**

**1. Introduction to Interconnection Configurations:**

The following discussion explores the interconnection configurations in a system with front-end and back-end components, utilizing crossbar switches. The configurations aim to optimize resource sharing and improve robustness.

**2. Crossbar Configurations:**

- **Single Crossbars:**
  - In this configuration, each pipeline stage is connected via a single crossbar.
  - This setup allows up to 50% more slices to share resources, but introduces a two-cycle latency between stages.

- **Front-Back Crossbars:**
  - Front-back crossbars connect the front-end (fetch-decode) and back-end (issue-execute/memory) stages.
  - This configuration can provide an alternative to single crossbars, improving interconnection handling and deployment algorithms.

- **Overlapping Crossbars:**
  - Overlapping crossbars provide additional connectivity by combining resources from neighboring slices.
  - This configuration can be combined with front-back crossbars to enhance resource sharing without significant performance loss.

**3. Configuration Algorithms:**

- **Single Crossbar Configuration:**
  - Input: Fault map of the entire SW chip.
  - Steps:
    1. Create a list of working stages.
    2. Group unique working stages within an island.
  - Example: Given a fault map, the algorithm identifies working stages and groups them into logical SNSs.

- **Overlapping Crossbar Configuration:**
  - Combines overlapping crossbars to provide additional connectivity.
  - Example: The addition of overlapping crossbars results in more logical SNSs, as shown in Figure 9.

- **Front-Back Crossbar Configuration:**
  - Divides the system into front-end and back-end bundles.
  - Steps:
    1. First-level Interconnect: Use simple crossbars or front-back crossbars.
    2. Front-back Bundling: Bundle remaining resources.
    3. Front-back Integration: Combine front-end and back-end bundles to form logical SNSs.
  - Example: Figure 10 illustrates the formation of logical SNSs using front-back crossbars.

**4. Interconnection Reliability:**

- **Link Reliability:**
  - Accounted for to a certain extent, introducing redundancy to handle wearout and variation.

- **Crossbar Reliability:**
  - Three alternatives:
    1. Simple Crossbar: Single crossbar switch with no redundancy.
    2. Simple Crossbar with Spare(s): One spare maintained for every crossbar.
    3. Fault-Tolerant Crossbar (FT): Expensive alternative that nearly eliminates the chances of crossbar failures.

**5. Architectural Parameters:**

- **Pipeline:**
  - 4-stage in-order pipeline based on the OR1200 RISC processor.
  - Frequency: 400 MHz
  - Area: 90nm process
  - Branch Predictor: Global, 16-bit history, BTB size - 2KB
  - L1 I$: 4-way, 16 KB, 1 cycle hit latency
  - L1 D$: 8-way, 64 KB per core, 5 cycle hit latency
  - L2 $: 40 cycle hit latency

**6. Variation Tolerance:**

- **Impact of Slower Components:**
  - Variation in operational frequencies across the chip can affect performance.
  - In a conventional CMP, the slowest component determines the overall speed.
  - SW systems can selectively operate a grid of resources, improving the distribution of slower components and enhancing overall performance.

**Conclusion:**
The discussed configurations and algorithms aim to optimize resource sharing and improve the reliability and performance of SW systems. The use of different crossbar configurations and the consideration of interconnection reliability are crucial for achieving these goals.
