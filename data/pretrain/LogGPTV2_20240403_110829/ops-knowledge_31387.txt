User: I am trying to run Google's deep dream. For some odd reason I keep getting

ImportError: No module named google.protobuf

after trying to import protobuf. I have installed protobuf using sudo install protobuf. I am running python 2.7 OSX Yosemite 10.10.3.
I think it may be a deployment location issue but i cant find anything on the web about it. Currently deploying to /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages.
Assistant: According to your comments, you have multiply versions of python
what could happend is that you install the package with pip of anthor python
pip is actually link to script that donwload and install your package.
two possible solutions:

go to $(PYTHONPATH)/Scripts and run pip from that folder that way you insure
you use the correct pip
create alias to pip which points to $(PYTHONPATH)/Scripts/pip and then run pip install

how will you know it worked?
Simple if the new pip is used the package will be install successfully, otherwise the package is already installed
