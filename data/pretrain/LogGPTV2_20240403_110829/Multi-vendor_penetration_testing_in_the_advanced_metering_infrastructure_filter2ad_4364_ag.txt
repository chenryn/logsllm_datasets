Cost Savings from Avoided Truck Rolls: SMUD reports saving more than $8.6 million in the first 13 
months following AMI deployment (April 2012-June 2013) by avoiding 110,000 truck rolls (with an 
average cost per truck roll of about $77). SMUD’s AMI system allowed it to avoid approximately 
$31,787,600 in meter operation costs from project initiation through March 31, 2014. The AMI system 
helped SMUD significantly reduce the need for manual meter operations, mainly through automated 
meter reading and automated service switching. 
Electric Vehicle Charging Pilot with TOU Rates: SMUD conducted a residential EV program with roughly 
200 vehicle participants to better understand off-peak charging potential with TOU rate options. SMUD 
tested two different TOU plans to determine driver satisfaction: a Whole House Time-of-Use pricing plan 
and a Dedicated Meter Pricing Plan that was sub-metered. The latter rate included up to 12 
Conservation Days when customers were signaled to reduce load during peak hours. Both pricing plans 
experienced high customer satisfaction. 
Evaluating Time-Based Rates with Customer Systems: SMUD implemented two CPP offers: one CPP-
only plan and one plan that included CPP and TOU pricing. Some customers enrolled in the program 
were offered IHDs. The CPP rate was $0.75 per kilowatt-hour. Compared to the standard two-tiered 
rate, the TOU-CPP rate offered discounted off-peak pricing that accounted for 91 percent of the summer 
hours, higher peak pricing that accounted for 8 percent of the summer hours, and event pricing that was 
initiated in three-hour blocks, 12 times per summer, for a total of less than 1 percent of the summer 
hours. SMUD mailed IHDs to customers in the opt-in treatment group pre-commissioned, so that when 
they were unpacked and turned on, the devices were designed to automatically connect with the 
customer’s meter and start displaying information. 
SMUD’s evaluation showed higher enrollment rates for opt-out approaches, without significant 
differences in drop-out rates or peak demand reductions. SMUD benefit-cost analysis showed greater 
net-benefits and more favorable business cases for opt-out than for opt-in, as opt-in programs typically 
required higher budgets for marketing and recruitment. 
Customer Savings for DLC Pilots with TOU Rates: SMUD compared bill impacts for customers on TOU-
CPP rates with customers on standard rates (both groups participated in a summer 2013 DLC pilot). 
SMUD found that TOU-CPP customers saved about 50 percent more than DLC pilot participants who 
chose to stay on standard rates did, as shown in Figure 15. However, the figure also shows that some 
customers on the TOU-CPP rate saw bill increases if they were unable to reduce or shift their electricity 
consumption. In 2012-2013, average summer bill savings exceeded $77 on the TOU-CPP rate for 
Summer Solutions participants and customers who used an IHD saw an average annual bill savings of 
just under $40 per year.  
Based on the results of its study, SMUD is consolidating all pricing tiers to produce a single flat rate for 
residential customers in 2018 and may consider transitioning all residential customers to default TOU 
rates thereafter.

Testing DLC Strategies: SMUD wanted to understand how different precooling strategies, temperatures, 
and ceiling insulation affect demand responses. In 2012, SMUD tested three DLC strategies: business-as-
usual (no pre-cooling)18, two hours pre-cooling, and 6 hours precooling. These strategies were deployed 
randomly to enable more accurate evaluations. On average, no pre-cooling reduced energy use and 
both two and six hours increased it. Six hours of pre-cooling resulted in a reduction in overall energy use 
for participants with more ceiling insulation.19

AMI System and Communications: An Ethernet/Internet protocol backhaul and a local wireless radio 
frequency (RF) network enable two-way communication between meters and utility data systems and 
allow for the monitoring and control of select distribution automation equipment. Data management 
systems enable GWP to develop actionable information from equipment notifications and customer 
electricity usage data. All capacitor banks include advanced controllers with communications devices, 
facilitating remote control via the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) distribution 
management system (DMS). 
Reduced Electricity Consumption from Customized Energy Reports: GWP mailed customized reports on 
energy consumption patterns and costs to about 46,000 households, which it says resulted in energy 
savings in 2011-2012 of about 5,777 megawatt-hours (4.1 percent). GWP’s web portal was launched in 
July 2012 and resulted in a 50 percent increase in web traffic to its site, where customers can view 
yearly, monthly, daily, and hourly interval usage information.

GLENDALE WATER AND POWER CASE STUDY 
Customer Systems Support Reduced Consumption: GWP offered customers in-home displays, a mobile 
device application, and a web portal facilitating two-way information exchange, allowing customers to 
view their consumption and manage their bills. GWP’s customer systems programs are received 
favorably. For example, 83 percent of the in-home program participants are using the information 
provided through their in-home displays and say they have changed their energy consumption behaviors 
and reduced energy and water use. GWP used a digital photo frame as part of its in-home display, 
enabling customers to track their usage without having to go online to access the data.  
Electric Vehicle and Thermal Energy Storage Pilots: GWP offered EV charging station incentives to 100 
customers and plans to implement new residential time-of-use and EV charging rates for customers by 
June 2017. GWP also integrated AMI with thermal energy storage systems for on-peak cooling of 
commercial and municipal buildings using ice made during off-peak hours.  
Leveraging AMI Investments for Additional Services: Outside of its SGIG project, GWP is installing a full-
scale deployment of smart water meters across its entire service area, leveraging the smart grid 
communications network and MDMS built under SGIG.

AMI System and Communications: BWP deployed and integrated two network types: a fiber optic 
network and a city-wide secure Wi-Fi mesh radio frequency network. The fiber optic Ethernet network 
allows for monitoring and control of the electric distribution system. Radio devices in smart meters 
transmit data through the new Wi-Fi network. The new meter data management and outage 
management systems use data and notifications from smart meters and automated distribution 
equipment.  
Reduced Field Service and Improved Customer Satisfaction: BWP used AMI to reduce field service 
requests by 87 percent, from about 2,500 to about 300 per month. BWP avoided a total of 
approximately 13,200 field trips by using the AMI systems to remotely fulfill field service requests 
between March 2013 and February 2014. This allowed BWP to reduce field service staff by seven 
positions and eliminate more than 13,200 field visits since AMI deployment. BWP can now respond to 
metering-related customer requests in 15 minutes or less, which is faster by hours or days than was 
possible before AMI. Customer satisfaction is higher as a result.

Reduced Bill Disputes and Faster Dispute Resolution: BWP’s call center managers found that having 
timely access to detailed usage information results in greater confidence in how a bill amount was 
determined, thus enabling faster decision making and quicker problem resolution. This results in a 
higher incidence of first-call dispute resolution.  
Integration with Outage Management and Distribution Automation: Last-gasp alerts are received by 
MDMS and relayed to OMS two minutes after receipt. This delay is inserted to allow circuit reclosers to 
restore power if the outage is caused by a momentary fault from surrounding vegetation. BWP’s system 
sends power restored alerts which are processed by MDMS and OMS and used by GIS to update the 
company’s outage map. The system also allows grid operators to test any meter to verify it has power. 
BWP found it useful to dedicate resources to monitor data quality, identify anomalies, and implement 
corrective actions to ensure MDMS data streams were received and used properly by billing, CIS, OMS, 
and other systems. The utility also recommends allowing sufficient time to plan AMI deployments 
including logistics, asset management, records management, workforce management, and integration 
with communications, MDMS, OMS, and other affected systems.  
Leveraging AMI Investments for Additional Services: Smart grid communications networks can be 
leveraged to provide additional customer services such as internet access, high-speed data access, and 
corporate intranets for companies with geographically dispersed facilities. Outside of its SGIG project, 
BWP also deployed smart water meters to all 26,000 of its water customers leveraging its smart grid 
communications networks. 
DSM Energy Savings and Customer Bill Savings: BWP estimates lifetime DSM program energy savings at 
more than 8 gigawatt-hours. These savings were achieved at a cost of about $0.08 per kilowatt-hour. 
These savings help BWP meet state-mandated goals for energy efficiency, and keeps demand growth 
constant even as population and business activity increases.  
In 2014, BWP estimated it saved a total of about 4.8 gigawatt hours, and reduced per-customer usage by 
1-2 percent between September 2011 and 2014 as a result of customers using the BWP energy usage 
reports and interactive web portal. During this same period, the 25,000 participating customers in its 
TOU program saw more than $1 million in collective bill savings. BWP is continuing its transition to time-
based rates with a new tariff for medium-sized commercial customers and implementation of an 
integrated automated dispatch system for demand response programs. 
Thermal Energy Storage Integration: BWP integrated AMI with thermal energy storage systems for on-
peak cooling of commercial and municipal buildings. These systems make ice at night during off-peak 
times and then provide cooling for the buildings during the day (on-peak). This shifts large fractions of 
electricity use for air conditioning from on-peak to off-peak periods. AMI enables integration of these ice 
storage systems with other types of demand response programs that reduce peak demand. BWP 
monitored and evaluated the ice storage units through its web portal and accounted for demand 
reductions using an integrated, automated dispatch system, which accessed consumption data on the 
units through the MDMS.

AMI System and Communications: Sioux Valley Energy (SVE) installed a power line carrier (PLC) network 
to enable two-way communications with the AMI meters and allow for monitoring and control of 
distribution automation equipment in both urban and rural environments. SVE monitors feeder loads, in 
near-real time, by aggregating smart meter data transmitted over the PLC network, improving 
distribution system operations and planning. 
Improved Customer Service from Pre-Pay Billing Program: SVE has more than 360 customers in a 
voluntary pre-pay billing program. Customers can sign up for pre-paid rates with a minimum of $25.00 
and allocate 50 percent of the funds to past due bills and 50 percent to future electricity use. This 
arrangement can be kept until the past due amount is paid off. If the customer opts-out, a deposit is 
required.

Sioux Valley Energy also reduced the amount charged to customers for collection trips by about 50 
percent from 2007 to 2014, from about $64,000 to about $34,000.  
Reduced Demand from Time-Based Rates and Testing Customer Notification: SVE’s 2011 CPP pilot 
program involved several thousand residential and agricultural households. There were two test groups, 
voluntary and involuntary, and a control group for each rate class. Energy usage for the three groups of 
each rate class was recorded bi-hourly over the months of June, July, and August. Critical peak events 
charged at $0.50 per kilowatt-hour; rate during other times was discounted based on budgeted revenue 
from CPP rate. Table 10 shows that phone calls were the most common approach, but that text 
messages were preferred the most. Nearly three-fourths of the survey respondents said that they were 
always aware of critical peak event days after being notified by 4:00 p.m. the day before.

SVE called 24 CPP event days and found that on average volunteer participants (opt-in) reduced peak 
demand by about 0.79 kilowatts (residential) and 1.10 kilowatts (farm-rural), while the non-volunteer 
participants (opt-out) reduced demand by about 0.23 kilowatts (residential) and 1.10 kilowatts (farm-
rural). SVE is developing an energy management application for smart phones to alert customers about 
critical peak event days.

4  Key Lessons and Conclusions 
SGIG utility experiences during the AMI and customer system projects resulted in seven key conclusions 
and lessons learned, from technology cost and installation to systems integration and customer 
engagement challenges.  
4.1  Multiple Factors Affect the AMI Business Case 
The total cost of AMI deployment and the payback period varied greatly from utility to utility, giving 
insight into the myriad factors that create a utility’s individual business case. Total AMI procurement and 
installation costs included not only the cost of the meter, but also a range of non-meter fixed costs, 
primarily communications equipment upgrades and data management systems. Other non-hardware 
costs included software and licensing fees, installation labor, information technology testing and 
requirements gathering, project management, software integration, and staff training. 
The total AMI system deployment cost ranged from $130 to $1,895 per meter. However, only six 
projects reported a total installation cost above $600 per meter. Differences in how each utility defined 
the cost categories (meter, communications, data management, and other) partially contribute to this 
large variation in reported costs. However, total implementation cost—and the rate of return on 
investment—are determined by multiple factors:

Breakdown  
generally had a lower total cost per meter 
because AMI communications network 
upgrades, data management system 
integration, and other fixed installation 
costs make up more than half of the total 
cost per meter on average. The meter 
device cost represented only about 47 
percent of the total cost per meter on 
average (see Figure 16). The total cost per 
meter reported by the pilot-scale projects 
skews the distribution, because the 
integration of communications equipment 
and information systems is a fixed cost that is 
allocated across a relatively smaller numbers of 
meters (see Figure 17). Once the communications networks and data management systems are 
in place, the incremental cost per additional meter typically drops.

•  Enabling more smart meter features and integrating AMI with a larger number of utility 
systems can raise the total AMI implementation cost, but also increase the value of benefits to 
support the business case. Additional functions enhanced revenue recovery from tamper 
detection, reduced outage management costs, enhanced voltage monitoring, and reduced peak 
demand from AMI-enabled DSM programs. 
•  The utility’s level of experience with AMI systems and the pre-project state of the existing
