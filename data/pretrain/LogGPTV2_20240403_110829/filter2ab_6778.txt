**ATT&CK ID:** C0025  
**Technique Name:** 2016 Ukraine Electric Power Attack

In the 2016 Ukraine Electric Power Attack, the Sandworm Team exploited MS-SQL access on a pivot machine to execute code across the Industrial Control System (ICS) network. [5]

### Explanation:
- **Pivot Machine:** A pivot machine is a compromised system within the target network that attackers use as a foothold to move laterally and gain further access.
- **MS-SQL Access:** The attackers leveraged their access to Microsoft SQL Server (MS-SQL) to execute malicious code, which allowed them to propagate through the ICS network.
- **ICS Network:** An Industrial Control System (ICS) network is a specialized system used in industrial and critical infrastructure environments for monitoring and controlling physical processes.

This attack highlights the importance of securing critical infrastructure and the potential vulnerabilities in networked systems.
