### Abstract
The rapid expansion of mobile broadband as a critical means of Internet connectivity has underscored the importance of scalable evaluation and inference of quality of experience (QoE) for applications delivered over LTE networks. However, direct QoE measurement is often time-consuming and resource-intensive. The wireless nature of LTE networks necessitates evaluating QoE across multiple locations per base station due to significant spatial variations in signal availability. Leveraging the observation that quality of service (QoS) metrics are less resource-intensive to collect, we investigate how QoS can be used to infer QoE in LTE networks. Using an extensive, novel dataset representing various network conditions, we design state-of-the-art predictive models for scalable video QoE inference. Our models accurately predict rebuffering events and resolution switching more than 80% of the time, despite the dataset exhibiting vastly different QoS and QoE profiles for different location types. We also demonstrate that our classifiers generalize well across multiple videos from diverse genres. Finally, we highlight the importance of low-cost QoS measurements such as reference signal received power (RSRP) and throughput in QoE inference through an ablation study.

## 1. Introduction
Over 60 million people reside in rural regions in the United States [18]. However, cellular deployment is often driven by economic demand, leading to concentrated deployment in urban areas and leaving economically marginalized and sparsely populated areas underserved [27]. Few studies have focused on assessing mobile broadband in rural areas, and there is a lack of comprehensive datasets that include both network-level and application-level traces representative of rural demographics. The COVID-19 pandemic has further highlighted the urgency of assessing QoE for applications like video streaming and interactive video chat, which are sensitive to network quality. Communities without access to high-speed broadband, particularly in rural areas, are at a disadvantage [8, 32].

Evaluating QoE for video streaming applications over LTE in regions where people are most likely to be smartphone-dependent [27, 28, 34] presents significant scalability challenges. QoE metric collection over LTE networks requires time and resource-intensive measurements for each network provider. In rural areas, obtaining LTE Internet measurements in places where people use mobile broadband (e.g., homes or local transportation corridors) is challenging due to the distance between points of interest and lower population density, which limits crowd-sourced measurement efforts [49]. This context leads us to ask: How can we infer QoE for video streaming applications over LTE at scale?

While few datasets measure QoE in rural communities, many public and proprietary datasets report QoS metrics such as RSRP and throughput. These metrics are typically reported independently and measured over LTE networks in various locations [46, 51â€“53, 59, 63]. We argue that the wealth of LTE-QoS data points across the U.S. can be leveraged to broadly assess QoE. Our goal is to develop a methodology that uses low-cost QoS measurements to predict QoE.

To study the correlation between mobile QoS and QoE performance, we conducted an extensive measurement campaign to collect 16 datasets of network traces from the Southwestern U.S. for four major telecom operators: AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, and Verizon. Our datasets vary along two primary axes: population density and network load. We collected LTE network measurements in multiple rural and urban communities and during crowded events in urban locations to capture atypical network utilization and congestion. We also collected baseline traces from the same urban locations under typical operating conditions. Our datasets are classified into three categories: under-provisioned (rural), congested (urban), and well-provisioned (baseline urban). We use these varied datasets to demonstrate the generality of our inference method.

Our key contributions and findings include:
- **Data Collection:** Sixteen measurement datasets from twelve locations, representing under-provisioned, congested, and well-provided network conditions, including over 32 million LTE packets.
- **Predictive Models:** Development and evaluation of comprehensive predictive models that infer video QoE from low-cost QoS measurements with at least 80% accuracy across all locations and network types.
- **Validation:** Validation of our models across multiple video types and demonstration of the utility of low-cost RSRP measurements for inferring video QoE.

## 2. Methodology and Datasets Overview
QoS metrics, such as received signal strength, latency, throughput, and packet loss, capture the state of network connectivity. While QoS provides an indication of network state, it may not directly correlate with user experience. QoS metrics are not Pareto-optimal; one element can improve or deteriorate without affecting others. Therefore, estimating user experience requires incorporating multiple network measures, which may be unique to time, space, and application. We focus on application-level QoE, as defined in [61].

### 2.1 QoS and QoE Metrics
We collected and estimated the following QoS and QoE metrics, summarized in Table 1:

#### Quality of Service Metrics
- **RSRP (Reference Signal Received Power):** Linear average of the power contributions of the resource elements carrying cell-specific reference signals within the measurement frequency bandwidth [2]. We recorded instantaneous RSRP readings every second using the Network Monitor application [43].
- **Throughput:** Measured by fetching a 500 MB file from an AWS instance in Virginia using iPerf over TCP. The large file size minimizes the effect of slow start, and we logged packet traces at 1-second intervals.

#### Quality of Experience Metrics
- **Video Resolution Switches:** Computed as the percentage of consecutive samples with different resolutions out of the total number of samples collected during the video. Measured at one-second granularity.
- **Rebuffering Events:** Recorded when the video pauses while the application buffer waits to accumulate enough content to resume playback. We recorded the video state (rebuffering event or normal playback) every second.

### 2.2 Measurement Suite
We conducted our measurements using Lenovo ThinkPad W550s laptops tethered to Motorola G7 Power (Android 9) phones via USB. The cellular plans on all devices had unlimited data and were hotspot-enabled to achieve the same performance as on the mobile device. This configuration facilitated ease of programming, data extraction, and unification of application-level measurements.

We chose YouTube as the streaming platform due to its popularity, capturing over 88% of the mobile market [62]. We ran a 3-minute clip of a Looney Tunes video [64] three times across each of the four LTE providers at each location, excluding sessions with playback errors. The video was chosen for its mix of high and low action scenes, resulting in variable bitrates. A 3-minute window was sufficient to reach steady state and capture rebuffering and resolution switches. To infer video QoE, we collected input features (RSRP and throughput) synchronously on a separate device to avoid biasing the video streaming measurements. Synchronous measurements of throughput, RSRP, and QoE metrics were required to train learning algorithms to infer video QoE for future instances. We used different servers for throughput and YouTube tests to obtain concurrent QoS and QoE measurements, reflecting real-world scenarios where throughput test servers and YouTube servers are separate but affected by varying cellular network conditions [6].

To execute this experiment, we automated the loading and playback of the video, ensuring consistent and repeatable measurements.
