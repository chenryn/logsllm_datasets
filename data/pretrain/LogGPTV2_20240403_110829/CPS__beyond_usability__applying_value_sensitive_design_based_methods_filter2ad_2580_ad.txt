relatively high thresholds on dislike and recommend against: the 
medical  alert  bracelet  with  a  password  (46%  dislike  and  33% 
recommend against) and the criticality-aware fail-open IMD (42% 
dislike  and  38%  recommend  against);  these  data  might  suggest 
avoiding the use of those three system concepts.  
In general, when we examine these evaluation results, we require 
high  satisfaction  thresholds  (i.e.,  high  “like”  and    “recommend” 
percentages, low “dislike” and “recommend against” percentages) 
in  order  to  describe  a  system  as  well-liked.  In  contrast,  less 
stringent  thresholds  are  necessary  to  describe  a  system  as 
problematic,  in  order  to  respect  the  perspectives  of  stakeholders 
who  may  be  in  the  minority.  This  is  in  line  with  the  value 
sensitive design dams and flows analysis guidelines [24]. 
Justifications.  As  noted  above,  the  evaluation  results  on  the 
security  system  concepts  immediately  raise  the  question  of  why

providers  like  or  dislike  a  system  or  would  recommend  for  or 
against its use. Recall that Table 2 provides a breakdown of some 
of the properties embodied by the various system concepts, such 
as requiring physical proximity to the patient or having a manual 
override. Providers are potentially reacting to these properties in 
their  evaluations.  Below  we  report  what  system  properties 
providers said they liked and disliked about each system; for the 
systems  that  were  particularly  high-ranked  or  low-ranked,  we 
break  out  the  relevant  properties  as  lists.  Note  that  participants 
provided the justifications for each system concept directly after it 
was  presented;  participant-supplied  justifications  are  potentially 
influenced  by  this  fact.  The  quantitative  evaluations  were 
completed after all system concepts had been presented.  
Medical Alert Bracelet with Password (System A). The medical 
alert bracelet was one of the system concepts most disliked (46%) 
and  recommended  against  (33%).  Providers  most  frequently 
expressed disliking System A for the following reasons: 
↓  Access  is  not  guaranteed—the  bracelet  may  be  forgotten, 
lost, stolen, damaged, or the patient may choose not to wear 
it. (E.g., “In an accident, the bracelet could be damaged/lost 
and  emergency  personnel  would  not  be  able  to  access 
device”) 
↓ 
↓  The  security  is  insufficient.  (E.g.,  “Way  too  easy  to 
maliciously steal password”) 
It visibly indicates to the patient and others that the patient 
has a condition. (E.g., “Identifies pt. as ‘having a problem’”) 
The  relatively  poor  reception  of  System  A  suggests  that  either 
these  properties  are  particularly  disagreeable  to  participants,  or 
that  the  advantages  are  not  sufficient  incentive  to  tolerate  the 
disadvantages.  When  participants  expressed  liking  that  the 
medical  bracelet  solution  they  noted  that  the  system  did  not 
depend on other equipment or systems, provided “reassurance” to 
the patient, was cheap, and provided some security. 
Centralized Database (System B). The centralized database was 
neither  one  of  the  highest-rated  nor  one  of  the  lowest-rated 
systems. Participants expressed concerns about: the availability of 
the database across regions, across providers and manufacturers, 
in case of disaster, or in case of other technical difficulties; how to 
identify patients to look them up in the database; how to secure 
the database and identify who is authorized to access it; who will 
administer the database and how they will fund and maintain it; 
and  the  fact  that  a  database  would  require  time  away  from  the 
bedside  to  access.  In  contrast,  participants  appreciated  that  this 
system  neither  required  nor  depended  upon  the  patient  to  wear 
anything, was theoretically universal, and provided more security 
than System A (the Medical Alert Bracelet with Password). 
UV-Visible Tattoo of a Password (System C). The UV-Visible 
Tattoo was the lowest-ranked system for all evaluation questions. 
Participants  expressed  disliking  this  system  for  the  following 
reasons: 
↓  Required  equipment  may  not  be  working,  accessible,  or 
timely  to  acquire.  (E.g.,  “requires  UV  light  (i.e.  working 
bulb, power source)”) 
Patients  may  have  cultural,  social,  or  personal  objections 
over a tattoo. (E.g., “religious restrictions against tattoos”) 
↓ 
↓  Access  is  not  guaranteed—the  tattoo  could  be  faded, 
damaged, or distorted. (E.g., “blood or trauma may obscure 
tattoo”) 
↓ 
Password revocation or changes could be complicated. (E.g., 
“how to change when device is changed out”)

invisibility in the patient’s daily life, both for human and security 
reasons;  and  the  fact  that  it  is  (theoretically)  always  with  the 
patient, but requires no patient effort. 
Fail-Open/Safety  Wristband  (System  D).  The  fail-open/safety 
wristband  was  the  highest-rated  system  across  all  categories. 
Participants reported liking the system for the following reasons: 
↑  The  fail-safe  mode  guarantees  access.  (E.g.,  “GREAT 
failsafe mode (remove bracelet)”) 
↑  The  system  provides  some  safety  features.  (E.g.,  “safety 
features BIG plus”) 
↑  The system provides some security features. (E.g., “Provides 
mechanism against snoops…equivalent to locking your door 
when you leave the house”) 
↑  The  mechanism  gives  access  control  power  to  the  patient. 
(E.g.,  “pt.  feels  empowered.  pt.  is  an  active  participant  in 
their own care”) 
Provides  a  visual  cue  to  EMTs.  (E.g.,  “identifies  patient  as 
having an ICD”) 
↑ 
Following  previous  lines  of  reasoning,  these  advantages  must 
outweigh  the  dislikes  expressed  by  participants:  that  there  is  no 
security  if  the  wristband  is  not  worn  (and  it  is  easily  removed); 
that the wristband requires battery replacements or recharging and 
requires the patient to wear it, for which there is no incentive; that 
there may be many false-positive calls to 911; that the patient is 
visibly  identified  as  having  a  medical  condition;  that  emergency 
medical  staff  would  require  training  to  know  to  remove  the 
wristband; and that the system is potentially expensive to develop 
and produce. 
Proximity-Based  Equipment  (System  E).  The  proximity-based 
equipment  was  neither  one  of  the  highest-rated  nor  one  of  the 
lowest-rated  systems;  this  system  most  closely  resembles  the 
status  quo  of  access  control  for  implantable  cardiac  devices. 
Participants expressed liking a variety of system properties: that it 
provides some security from wireless tampering; that it does not 
require the patient to wear or do anything (and therefore does not 
provide a visual indication of the patient’s condition); that it does 
not depend upon other equipment or systems; that it is similar to 
the current model; that it is easy, and allows bedside access; that it 
would  be  a  (theoretically)  universal  access  system;  and  that  it 
gives the patient some control over who may access their device. 
Conversely,  participants  reported  disliking:  that  patients  are  still 
susceptible  to  in-person  security  breaches;  that  such  a  system 
would  require  new  equipment,  which  is  expensive;  that  such  a 
system would potentially be manufacturer-specific; and that such 
a system would require all medical centers to have the equipment 
on-hand and readily accessible for emergencies. 
Criticality-Aware  Fail-Open  IMD  (System  F).  The  criticality-
aware  IMD  was  one  of  the  systems  most  disliked  (42%)  and 
recommended against (38%). Providers most frequently expressed 
disliking System F for the following reasons:  
↓  The  IMD  may  not  correctly  identify  a  medical  emergency 
(false  negative—closed  access).  (E.g.,  “this  assumes  the 
device  can  properly  recognize  emergencies  →  current 
devices can’t even recognize some arrhythmias correctly”) 
↓  The  IMD  may  incorrectly  identify  a  medical  emergency 
(E.g.,  “possibility  of 
(false  positive—open  access). 
misidentifying a ‘medical emergency’”) 
↓  There  may  be  non-emergency  situations  where  the  IMD 
needs  to  be  accessed.  (E.g.,  “what  happens  if  the  patient 
moves and has a new cardiologist?”) 
↓  This  system  could  change  IMD  size  or  shape,  consume 
battery life, or cost more. (E.g., “will certainly add expense

6.  PROVIDER VS. PATIENT RESULTS 
Recall that this medical provider study was conducted in part to 
complement  the  prior  study  on  patients’  views  and  values 
regarding  early-stage  security  solutions  for  implantable  cardiac 
devices  [7].  The  set  of  systems  presented  to  medical  providers 
was  the  same  as  those  presented  to  patients  with  the  following 
exceptions:  three  somewhat  redundant  system  concepts  were 
removed  (i.e.,  visible  tattoo  of  a  password,  fail-open  wristband, 
and  fail-open/patient-specified-functionality  wristband)  and  one 
new  security  concept  was  included:  a  centralized  database. 
Additionally, 
the 
participants. For the medical providers, the system concepts were 
presented  in  a  group  setting  via  a  verbal  description  and 
supporting slides. For the patients—many of whom were older or 
ill—the system concepts were presented to each individual with a 
verbal  description  and  a  physical  mockup  as  a  prop;  patients 
provided  verbal  feedback  as  part  of 
their  semi-structured 
(individual)  interviews.  The  questions  asked,  while  similar  in 
substance,  were  also  slightly  different  as  appropriate  to  the 
individual’s role (as a medical provider or a patient). 
We  now  consider  the  quantitative  results  from  both  studies 
together,  as  a  way  to  explore  security  concepts  that  might  be 
successful for both sets of stakeholder groups. For the proximity-
based  equipment  approach  (System  E):  in  the  patient  study  this 
security concept was least disliked (0% dislike), and hence might 
be  the  most  logical  system  to  choose;  however,  25%  of  the 
medical  providers  disliked 
the  proximity-based  equipment 
approach and 17% would recommend against its use, making it a 
less  desirable  choice  overall.  In  a  similar  vein,  the  criticality-
aware  fail-open  IMD  (System  F)  was  more  liked  (27%)  than
