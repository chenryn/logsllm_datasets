User: When I do sometask.async_apply(args=['args1','args2'],  kwargs={'queue': 'dev'}) nothing ends up on the queue 'dev'. I'm wondering if I am missing a step somewhere? I have created the queue 'dev' already and it shows up under queues when I check the rabbitmq management.
Assistant: you should do something like that:
sometask.apply_async(args = ['args1','args2'], queue = 'dev')
