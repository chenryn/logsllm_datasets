User: So, I have decided to write my next project with python3, why? Due to the plan for Ubuntu to gradually drop all Python2 support within the next year and only support Python3. (Starting with Ubuntu 13.04)
gevent and the memcached modules aren't officially ported to Python3.
What are some alternatives, already officially ported to Python3, for gevent and pylibmc or python-memcached?
Assistant: for memcached you probably know alternative: redis+python3
