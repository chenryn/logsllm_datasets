have conﬁrmed using VanLAN BSs that connectivity in the other
direction behaves similarly. The results below are based on a four-
week trace of beacons logged on Channel 11. Results for Channel
1 are qualitatively similar, except that Channel 11 provides overall
better connectivity in our testbed.
Connectivity sessions start when a beacon is ﬁrst received from
the BS and expire if no beacon is received for a ﬁxed time thresh-
old. To highlight intermittent disruptions, we use two time thresh-
olds to expire current sessions. A high threshold of 60s is intended
to capture meta sessions, i.e., the entire period between the client
coming and going out of range of the BS. A low threshold of 2s is
intended to capture mini sessions that are contained within a meta
session. Consecutive mini sessions are separated by periods of very
poor or no connectivity. The 2s limit is chosen so that enough (at
least 20) beacons are transmitted to reliably identify these periods.
If disruptions are common, mini sessions will be much shorter than
meta sessions.
Figure 2 shows the distribution of the duration and length of meta
and mini sessions for VanLAN BSs and for other BSs in the en-
vironment. It excludes sessions in which less than 10 beacons are
received to ignore trivial sessions with distant BSs. Length of a ses-
sion is distance covered by the van between the starting and ending
positions of the session.
Meta sessions are much longer than mini sessions. For VanLAN,
the median durations are 100s for meta sessions and 14s for mini
sessions; for other BSs, the corresponding durations are 30s and
12s. This implies that intermittent disruptions often break meta ses-
sions into multiple mini sessions. We refer to these disruptions as
“gray” periods. They do not necessarily represent a complete loss
of connectivity because only a ﬁnite number of beacons are trans-
mitted during this period. They do, however, represent a period of
very poor connectivity in which none of the 20 or more transmit-
ted beacons are received. Such disruptions can signiﬁcantly hurt
interactive applications such as voice and even those that use TCP
if connections time out.
The differences in VanLAN and other BSs in Figure 2 contrast
their connectivity sessions. Both have gray periods, but VanLAN
BSs have longer meta sessions, likely because they are closer to
nearby roads whereas other BSs could be deep inside buildings.
Interestingly, however, due to gray periods these longer meta ses-
sions do not translate to longer mini sessions. Both types of BSs
have comparable mini session durations.
We now illustrate the behavior of connectivity sessions in more
detail by showing individual examples. Figure 3 shows the experi-
ence of the van in one round with respect to the circled BS. We see
Figure 3: Gray periods can occur even close to the BS. The ﬁg-
ure shows the experience of the van in an example round with
respect to the circled BS. Thick lines represent regions where
beacons were received without a silent period of at least 2s.
Thin lines represents the complement.

that the connectivity is not continuous but contains several silent
periods of at least 2s. Except for the one big silent period at the
bottom of the path, where the van is completely out of range, the
disruptions are short and represent gray periods. Observe that gray
periods are not limited to regions where the client is far from the
BS and sometimes occur close to the BS.
Figure 4 provides a detailed view of an example meta session.
It plots the beacon reception ratio (BRR) over 1-second intervals.
This meta session has two major mini sessions, separated by a gray
period at 80s. Even within a mini session, the connection quality
varies signiﬁcantly due to vehicular mobility and changes in the
wireless environment.

Thus, the nature of connectivity between a BS and a mobile
client that we ﬁnd is quite complex. It is different from that ob-
served in previous WiFi-based studies of controlled environments [10,
7]; well-deﬁned phases are absent, and poor connectivity periods
can arise even close to the BS. It is, however, similar to studies of
cellular networks in urban settings [13].
5. UNDERSTANDING GRAY PERIODS
Gray periods can pose a signiﬁcant challenge to providing unin-
terrupted connectivity to applications. In this section, we ﬁrst study
their frequency and duration and then investigate whether their oc-
currence can be predicted. We also speculate on the factors that
lead to gray periods.
5.1 Frequency and Length
Figure 5(a) shows the distribution of the number of gray periods
in a meta session. It excludes gray periods that separate mini ses-
sions with less than 10 packets, to ignore trivial mini sessions. We
see that gray periods are common: roughly 80% of meta sessions
for VanLAN BSs and 50% of the meta sessions for other BSs con-
tain at least one gray period. (Recall that VanLAN meta sessions
tend to be longer than those for other BSs.)
Whether an application is robust to gray periods depends on the
duration of poor connectivity that it can withstand. Figure 5(b)
shows the duration of gray periods. The x-axis is in log scale. The
minimum is 3s because we expire a mini session only when the
silence period lasts for more than 2s. Most gray periods are short-
lived, though some last for more than 10s. Given typical RTTs
of less than 200 ms [14], our results suggest that TCP-based ap-
plications are likely to suffer under these conditions because gray
periods tend to last for more than a few RTTs.
5.2 Prediction using Current Measurements
We now investigate if the occurrence of a gray period can be
predicted. This prediction ability would enable applications to take
steps to blunt their impact. We consider two classes of prediction
techniques: i) using current measurements; and ii) using longer-
term history of performance at the current location.
To evaluate the effectiveness of current measurements in predict-
ing gray periods, we consider measurements of RSSI, BRR, speed,
and distance from the BS. Many wireless clients today use the ﬁrst
two measures to determine if the connection to the BS is about to
falter. The last two may be able to predict the onset of a gray period
if gray periods commonly occur, for instance, at high speeds or far
away from the BS.
Figure 6 shows that none of the measures above can reliably pre-
dict an impending gray period.
It plots the distribution of these
measures in the 1-second interval before a gray period (“End,” of
a mini session) and in other 1-second intervals. (“Non-End”). The
distance graph is based on VanLAN BSs alone because we do not
know the location of other BSs; the other graphs include data from
all BSs. Out of the four, RSSI, speed, and distance measurements
for periods right before a gray period are almost indistinguishable
from measurements during other times. For BRR, the intervals be-
fore a gray period usually have lower BRR, which suggests that
gray periods often follow times of poor connectivity. Nevertheless,
there is no threshold a client can use to reliably predict the onset of
a gray period; any threshold will have many false positive or false
negatives. We also considered variations of these measures, such as
combining them and using exponential averages, but ﬁnd that they
too are ineffective at predicting an impending gray period.
5.3 Prediction using Longer-term History
Another potential method for predicting gray periods is using the
history of the connectivity experienced at a location. This would be
effective if most gray periods consistently occur at the same loca-
tion, for instance, due to permanent obstructions (e.g., trees).
By comparing where gray periods occur in individual traversals
to average performance of those locations across multiple traver-
