User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How do I associate server traffic to a domain hosted on that server? I have three or four Linux servers, each of which hosts anywhere from 5 to 50 domains. Each domain has its own folder:

/www/projectname/web/

Logs go in:

/www/projectname/log

However, if there's a traffic spike (or, as I see it on my end, a memory usage spike), I'm not sure how to figure out which domain is responsible for the traffic without running tail -f on each of the projects and making an educated guess based on how fast things scroll.

There's got to be a better way! There probably is, but I haven't seen it. And the last time I checked, bandwidth monitors only report system-wide load.

So if anyone knows how to do this the right way, please let me know.

Thanks!

EDIT: My goal is for something that gives instant feedback. I know I can configure Apache to log bytes sent and received, but it doesn't necessarily help if my server is getting hammered and I'm trying to figure out which domain all the traffic is from.

Assistant: You could also enable the Apache status page and restrict it to your IP, then look for trends on which pages are being requested.

Sample output: http://www.apache.org/server-status

Configuration:

&lt;Location /server-status&gt;
    SetHandler server-status
    Order Deny,Allow
    Deny from all
    Allow from &lt;your IP&gt;
&lt;/Location&gt;
