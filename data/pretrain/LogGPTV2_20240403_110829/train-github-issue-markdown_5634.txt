Certainly! Here is a revised and more professional version of your text:

I have the following text data that I would like to read into a DataFrame:

```plaintext
Date,Open,High,Low,Close,Volume
May 16, 2014,2.92,2.93,2.82,2.85,25,715,748
May 15, 2014,3.02,3.05,2.88,2.92,28,311,224
Aug 8, 2013,1.97,1.98,1.94,1.95,20,100,154
Aug 7, 2013,1.89,1.97,1.87,1.95,29,206,564
Aug 6, 2013,1.95,2.01,1.88,1.90,52,198,842
Aug 5, 2013,1.88,1.94,1.88,1.92,29,041,924
Aug 2, 2013,1.86,1.88,1.83,1.86,22,169,076
```

This data is from an HTML table with six columns: `Date`, `Open`, `High`, `Low`, `Close`, and `Volume`.

When I attempt to read this data using either `read_csv` or `read_table`, I encounter unexpected output. Below is my script:

```python
import pandas as pd
from io import StringIO

data3 = """Date,Open,High,Low,Close,Volume
May 16, 2014,2.92,2.93,2.82,2.85,25,715,748
May 15, 2014,3.02,3.05,2.88,2.92,28,311,224
Aug 8, 2013,1.97,1.98,1.94,1.95,20,100,154
Aug 7, 2013,1.89,1.97,1.87,1.95,29,206,564
Aug 6, 2013,1.95,2.01,1.88,1.90,52,198,842
Aug 5, 2013,1.88,1.94,1.88,1.92,29,041,924
Aug 2, 2013,1.86,1.88,1.83,1.86,22,169,076"""

df = pd.read_table(StringIO(data3),
                   header=0,
                   thousands=',',
                   sep=" ",
                   parse_dates=False)

print(df)
```

The output I get is:
![Output Image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5865600/3008327/a4535af4-deb8-11e3-931f-8c1ec97c41e5.png)

However, I would like to have the following output:
![Desired Output Image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5865600/3008341/ec649ad8-deb8-11e3-9207-02e3051cc9d8.png)

If I set the `parse_dates` parameter to `True`, I get even more unexpected results:

I am unsure if this is a bug or if I am doing something wrong. Any guidance would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you,
Mickael
