User: What is the difference between the MySQL storage engine InnoDB and MyISAM?
Assistant: 1. Transaction support: InnoDB supports transaction processing, while MyISAM does not support transactions. 2. Locking level: InnoDB supports row-level locking and table-level locking, while MyISAM only supports table-level locking. 3. Performance: In the case of high concurrent read and write, InnoDB has better performance than MyISAM. InnoDB supports buffer pool and adaptive hash index, which can effectively reduce the number of disk I/O. 4. Integrity: InnoDB supports foreign key constraints and row-level locking, which can ensure data integrity. MyISAM only supports table-level locking and cannot guarantee data integrity. 5. Backup and recovery: InnoDB supports hot backup and online recovery, and can perform backup and recovery without stopping. MyISAM only supports offline backup and recovery. Summary: If you need to support high concurrency, data integrity and transaction processing, you should use the InnoDB storage engine. For scenarios with simple queries and few reads and writes, consider using the MyISAM storage engine.
