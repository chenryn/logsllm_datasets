Abstract
Cybercriminal entrepreneurs on online anonymous markets
rely on security mechanisms to thwart investigators in at-
tributing their illicit activities. Earlier work indicates that –
despite the high-risk criminal context – cybercriminals may
turn to poor security practices due to competing business
incentives. This claim has not yet been supported through
empirical, quantitative analysis on ground-truth data. In this
paper, we investigate the security practices on Hansa Mar-
ket (2015-2017) and measure the prevalence of poor security
practices across the vendor population (n = 1,733).
We create ‘vendor types’ based on latent proﬁle analysis,
clustering vendors that are similar regarding their experience,
activity on other markets, and the amount of physical and dig-
ital items sold. We then analyze how these types of vendors
differ in their security practices. To that end, we capture their
password strength and password uniqueness, 2FA usage, PGP
adoption and key strength, PGP-key reuse and the traceability
of their cash-out. We ﬁnd that insecure practices are prevalent
across all types of vendors. Yet, between them large differ-
ences exist. Rather counter-intuitively, Hansa Market vendors
that sell digital items – like stolen credit cards or malware –
resort to insecure practices more often than vendors selling
drugs. We discuss possible explanations, including that ven-
dors of illicit digital items may perceive their risk to be lower
than vendors of illicit physical items.
1 Introduction
Cybercriminals deploy security mechanisms that are intended
to hinder investigators in their attribution efforts, making it dif-
ﬁcult to link cybercriminal activity in the underground econ-
omy to an identity, location or machine [14,64]. Since ‘opera-
tional security’ (OPSEC) techniques are frequently shared in
the underground community [4, 56] and given the increasing
amount of law enforcement scrutiny [15], we should expect
that among cybercriminal entrepreneurs on online anonymous
markets, poor security practices are rarely present.
However, there are numerous indications in earlier work
that cybercriminals do not always achieve maximum security.
Due to competing business incentives, criminals may turn
to insecure practices that ease transacting illegal products or
services. Here, we witness an inevitable trade-off between
enhanced security and improved efﬁciency of operations [42].
‘Perfect security’ therefore, is not economically viable. Like
in the legitimate economy [54], security in the underground
economy comes at a cost [53]. This leads us to wonder how
prevalent poor security practices (or: “insecure practices”)
among online anonymous market vendors actually are.
While in earlier work attempts have been made to quan-
tify insecure practices of cybercriminals trading in the un-
derground economy, these only focus on a single, speciﬁc
mechanism – e.g., PGP-adoption [49], consistent VPN us-
age [50] and the reuse of usernames and/or PGP-keys across
different markets [59]. Moreover, it remains unknown who are
behaving insecurely most often and we are left completely in
the dark regarding why. All of these security mechanisms are
designed and implemented to compromise the availability or
usefulness of evidence to the forensic process [24]. Here, we
should acknowledge that some market-based security mech-
anisms apply to every vendor. Rules, policies, content mod-
eration, account veriﬁcation and the mandatory use of cryp-
tocurrencies and Tor-routing are examples of mechanisms that
are imposed and enforced by the market [2, 7, 22, 62]. These
mechanisms make up a form of ‘extra-legal governance’ that
contributes to a more secure and trustworthy trading environ-
ment [13,34]. Still, not all security mechanisms are introduced
by the market administrators.
In this paper, we focus on speciﬁcally these mechanisms, as
only unimposed practices can differ between vendors. To be
precise, we analyze their password strength, password unique-
ness, 2FA-usage, PGP-key adoption and key-strength, reuse
of PGP-keys over multiple markets and the traceability of
their cash-out to bitcoin exchanges. We capture these prac-
tices on a single market – Hansa Market, which was active
from late 2015 to mid 2017. Seized data originating from the
web server that hosted the market, has been made available
USENIX Association

to us by Dutch law enforcement. We combine the back-end
database with three other data sources to measure the preva-
lence of poor security practices across the vendor population.
In short, we make the following contributions:
• We present the ﬁrst empirical, quantitative analysis lever-
aging unique ground-truth data to investigate vendor
security practices on an online anonymous market.
• We measure the prevalence of poor security practices
across different types of vendors on Hansa Market. For
instance, we uncover that almost 40% of all vendors
(n = 1,733) did not enable 2FA and ﬁnd that at least
10% of vendors cash-out directly to mainstream bitcoin
exchanges. Poor practices are also observed among the
most successful vendors.
• We demonstrate that poor security practices do not occur
at random. Rather counter-intuitively, vendors on Hansa
Market selling digital cybercrime items are more likely
to have insecure practices than vendors selling physical
items – e.g., drugs.
• We discuss possible explanations for our ﬁndings, includ-
ing that the perceived risk of transacting illicit digital
items may be lower than the perceived risk for illicit
physical items.
We structure the remainder of this paper as follows. Section 2
identiﬁes the security practices of vendors on online anony-
mous markets. Section 3 elaborates on the data we analyze
and our approach to measure the prevalence of insecure prac-
tices. In Section 4, we identify characteristics of vendors that
can relate to their security practices and we cluster vendors
with similar characteristics into distinct ‘vendor types’. Sec-
tion 5 shows how we capture the identiﬁed security practices,
then we apply these measurements on the data to investigate
the security practices across vendor types. We discuss possi-
ble explanations for differences in vendors’ security practices
as well as limitations and implications of our work in Sec-
tion 6.We show how our work connects to related work in
Section 7. Section 8 concludes.
2 Security practices on online anonymous
markets
Online anonymous marketplaces take a prominent place in to-
day’s cybercrime ecosystem [25]. The ﬁrst successful online
anonymous marketplace – also referred to as a dark(net) mar-
ket or cryptomarket – was Silk Road, which opened shop early
2011 [49]. This market introduced pseudonymous trading
through an innovative platform only accessible through onion
routing (Tor) and on which solely cryptocurrencies were ac-
cepted as mean of payment. By the end of 2013, Silk Road was
shut down by law enforcement agencies. In the short period of
time that Silk Road was active, it made its mark on the ecosys-
tem as other initiatives successfully copy its business model to
this day [49]. A decade later, some industry reports estimate
the yearly revenue of all online anonymous markets combined,
to be more than $790 million worth in cryptocurrencies [6].
First, predominantly illegal narcotics and prescription drugs
were transacted on these marketplaces [7]. Nowadays, they
also serve as one-stop shops for digital items – ranging from
stolen credit cards to ransomware toolkits [58].
For those offering illicit substances or cybercrime items,
online anonymous markets are attractive platforms to conduct
their business on. The platforms provide contractual safe-
guards – like an escrow and review system – and anonymity
enhancing functionalities that are superior to their alterna-
tives [49, 58]. On top of that, vendors can employ additional
security practices – ranging from authentication mechanism
to obfuscating cash-out techniques. But, which practice makes
perfect?
In this paper we aim to investigate which types of vendors
pay more attention to their security than others. Thus, the
security practices that the market imposes on all vendors, are
not of our interest. Rather, we focus on the security practices
that may differ between individuals. Leveraging earlier
advances into ‘deviant security’ 1, we take the following six
practices that impact the security of vendors into account.
Later, in Sections 5 and 7, we will elaborate on the earlier
work identifying these practices, and report how we are able
to capture them in the data available to us.
Password strength. Although password authentication
has been around for decades, people still have a tendency
to choose predictable passwords [16], criminals included.
This leaves them open to brute-force attacks that can give
third-parties – e.g., rivals or law enforcement – access to
their accounts. Which in turn, may lead to irreparable harm
to business continuity.
Password uniqueness. A theoretically complex, but non-
unique password can also be easily breached [3,31]. Research
suggests that password reuse is common, even among those
who are security-aware [18, 61]. Additionally, databases
of leaked passwords may include usernames or email
addresses. Thus, password reuse can also lead to compro-
misability of users that operate on online anonymous markets.
2FA usage. Some markets provide users with the ability to
enable two-factor authentication [55]. A 2FA-enabled login
uses PGP as a veriﬁcation mechanism, in which the user is
challenged to decrypt a ciphertext that is encrypted with their
public key [66]. This can only be achieved when in possession
of the secret private key, making it an extra lock on the door.

PGP usage. On online anonymous markets, PGP-encryption
is the most used encryption protocol for secure communica-
tion [9]. Estimations show that in 2015, approximately 90%
of market vendors listed a PGP-key on their proﬁle [49]. The
procedure to set up PGP is infamously known to be difﬁcult
to understand for the layman [48]. However, tutorials are
widely shared within the cybercriminal community [56].
PGP-keys are based on a factoring problem, thus any key
with a length of 2048+ bits is considered secure until the year
2030 [3, 32].
PGP-key reuse. Unlinkability is an attribute of conﬁ-
dentiality [45]. When multiple usernames belonging to a
single real-world entity are linkable, a security risk arises.
Law enforcement may accumulate advanced knowledge on
a persons behaviour and identity, potentially resulting in
bringing this person to justice [28, 53]. Still, some vendors
that are active on multiple markets knowingly increase the
linkability of their pseudonyms. A clear link between user
accounts enables acquired reputation to be transferred to
other markets [59]. The PGP-key listed by a vendor can
create such a link. PGP-keys are suitable for signalling
trustworthiness and transferring reputation, because their
legitimacy can be veriﬁed by asking the other party to
decrypt a text [51]. Using PGP-keys to link pseudonyms
over different markets has been successfully used in prior
work [5, 49, 51, 59].
Traceability of cash-out. Bitcoin exchanges facilitate the
conversion of bitcoins to ﬁat currency. Because of their often
mainstream nature, these intermediaries can be subjected
to regulation and subpoenaed for information on their
clients [39]. This information may include full names and IP-,
email-, or even residential addresses. Therefore, we consider
it an insecure practice when the cash-out is traceable, thus
when criminal earnings can be easily linked to an exchange.
Cash-outs can be traced by analyzing the public ledger of the
bitcoin blockchain.
We also identiﬁed security practices that did not have an indis-
putable effect on security. These either increase, or decrease
security risks. These practices are excluded from further anal-
ysis, as it remains ambiguous how these affect the security
of a user. First, the use of the market’s auto-encryption func-
tionality increases the security of those that would not use
PGP-encryption otherwise, while it also constitutes a signif-
icant risk to security in case of law enforcement interven-
tions [4]. The same rationale applies to alternative messaging
platforms, such as Jabber, ICQ, or Skype [1, 50, 57]. Second,
regarding the mentioning of data minimization and data de-
struction practices in proﬁle descriptions and listings [1,47], it
remains unknown whether these practices are actually applied
or merely mentioned. Lastly, with regards to shipping physi-
cal items over jurisdictional borders, Decary-Hetu et al. [10]
argue that such cross-border shipments pose a security risk,
while Van de Sandt [53] demonstrates that doing so creates
information asymmetries between jurisdictions that beneﬁt
security. Also, many non-security related factors inﬂuence the
decision to ship internationally [12, 52].
3 Methodology
Now that we have a robust overview of pervasive security
practices, we can turn to how our data sources enable us to
measure these practices. In this section we elaborate on our
data, discuss the ethics of using seized data, provide descrip-
tives and present our measurement approach.
3.1 Data
In this paper we leverage four data sources: 1) the Hansa
Market back-end database, 2) the ‘Have I Been PWND’
password database, 3) the database of the Grams search
engine and 4) the Chainalysis blockchain analysis service.
We describe these data sources, one by one, below.
Hansa Market. There have been several law enforcement
interventions that directly targeted online anonymous markets
and resulted in take-downs. In Operation Bayonet (2017) two
of the largest online anonymous markets were shut down [15].
First, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) took down
AlphaBay on July 5th 2017. Thousands of AlphaBay users
in search of a new platform to continue their business on,
migrated to Hansa Market. However, those who did, fell right
into a trap. As this market was already inﬁltrated and under
full control of the High Tech Crime Unit of the Dutch Police
(NHTCU). This unit operated – as they also had taken over
the admin accounts – the market from June 20th until they
shut down the market on July 21st. In this period of time, the
NHTCU even turned off the encryption of personal messages,
and the hashing of passwords [20]. The sting operation not
only resulted in the collection of valuable data such as names
and street addresses of buyers, it also disrupted the ecosystem
by causing distrust [59].
When Hansa Market was inﬁltrated by NHTCU, they ﬁrst
migrated the web servers in order to operate the market
themselves and thereafter seize all contents. After the market
was shut down, Dutch law enforcement shared the back-end
data with other law enforcement agencies [15] and allowed us
restricted access for in-depth analyses. In Section 3.3 we will
extensively report on the subsets of back-end data, as we –
despite the nature of our access – want to be as transparent as
possible. Next, we will discuss the ethics of using the seized
back-end of Hansa Market in greater detail in Section 3.2.
Have I Been PWND. The ‘Have I Been Pwnd?’ (HIBP)
service accumulates login credentials found in hundreds
of breached databases. On this website, users may search
USENIX Association

whether their credentials were compromised in any (known)
data leaks. The website is regularly updated with new data
breaches. The full database of SHA1-hashed passwords
is publicly available [29]. At the time of our analysis, the
most recent version (v6) of the database contained more
than 10 billion leaked passwords, of which 573 million are
unique [30].
Grams. Grams, a “Google for darknet markets” [65], made
it possible to search through various markets at once. The
search engine indexed listings and vendors through custom
API-calls to the most popular markets. In doing so, it allowed
users to locate their favorite vendors on multiple markets
using a vendor’s public PGP-key. Grams shut down in
December 2017. We were allowed to match records from the
Hansa back-end with a copy of the database that was acquired
by law enforcement before its administrator announced the
shutdown of the search engine on Reddit [19].
Chainalysis. Raw bitcoin blockchain data consists of logs
of transactions between bitcoin addresses. It does not include
any context that can be used to make sense of this data. Com-
mercial and non-commercial tools are available that do pro-
vide this context [27]. These tools enable researchers and law
enforcement investigators to track monetary ﬂows between
distinct entities [26]. In this paper, we use the Chainalysis
blockchain analysis service. This service mainly makes use
of a co-spend clustering heuristic. Co-spending occurs when
two addresses engage in a single outgoing transaction [23].
