**Abstract**

Cybercriminals operating on online anonymous markets rely on security mechanisms to evade attribution by investigators. Previous research suggests that, despite the high-risk nature of their activities, cybercriminals may adopt poor security practices due to competing business incentives. This paper provides the first empirical, quantitative analysis of vendor security practices on Hansa Market (2015-2017) using ground-truth data.

We create 'vendor types' based on latent profile analysis, clustering vendors with similar experience, activity on other markets, and the quantity of physical and digital items sold. We then analyze the security practices of these vendor types, including password strength and uniqueness, 2FA usage, PGP adoption and key strength, PGP-key reuse, and the traceability of cash-out. Our findings indicate that insecure practices are prevalent across all vendor types, but there are significant differences between them. Counterintuitively, vendors selling digital items, such as stolen credit cards or malware, exhibit more insecure practices than those selling physical items like drugs. We discuss possible explanations, including the perception that the risk associated with digital items is lower than that for physical items.

**1. Introduction**

Cybercriminals use security mechanisms to hinder investigators from attributing illegal activities to specific identities, locations, or machines. Given the frequent sharing of operational security (OPSEC) techniques in the underground community and increased law enforcement scrutiny, one might expect that poor security practices would be rare among cybercriminals. However, previous research indicates that competing business incentives often lead to the adoption of insecure practices, even if they compromise security. This trade-off between enhanced security and operational efficiency raises questions about the prevalence of poor security practices among vendors on online anonymous markets.

Previous studies have quantified specific security practices, such as PGP adoption, consistent VPN usage, and the reuse of usernames and PGP keys across different markets. However, these studies do not provide a comprehensive view of who engages in insecure practices and why. In this paper, we focus on unimposed security practices, analyzing password strength, password uniqueness, 2FA usage, PGP key adoption and strength, PGP-key reuse, and the traceability of cash-out. We use data from Hansa Market, which was active from late 2015 to mid-2017, and combine it with three other data sources to measure the prevalence of poor security practices across the vendor population.

**Contributions:**
- **Empirical Analysis:** We present the first empirical, quantitative analysis using unique ground-truth data to investigate vendor security practices on an online anonymous market.
- **Prevalence Measurement:** We measure the prevalence of poor security practices across different types of vendors on Hansa Market, finding that almost 40% of all vendors did not enable 2FA and at least 10% cashed out directly to mainstream bitcoin exchanges.
- **Vendor Types:** We demonstrate that poor security practices are not random. Vendors selling digital items are more likely to engage in insecure practices than those selling physical items.
- **Explanations:** We discuss possible explanations for our findings, including the perceived lower risk associated with digital items compared to physical items.

**2. Security Practices on Online Anonymous Markets**

Online anonymous marketplaces, also known as darknet markets or cryptomarkets, play a significant role in today's cybercrime ecosystem. The first successful online anonymous marketplace, Silk Road, introduced pseudonymous trading through Tor and accepted only cryptocurrencies. Despite its shutdown in 2013, other initiatives continue to copy its business model. Today, these markets generate an estimated annual revenue of over $790 million in cryptocurrencies, offering a wide range of illicit goods and services, from narcotics to digital items like stolen credit cards and ransomware toolkits.

For vendors, these platforms provide contractual safeguards, anonymity, and additional security practices. However, the effectiveness of these practices varies. We focus on six specific practices that impact vendor security:
- **Password Strength:** Predictable passwords leave accounts vulnerable to brute-force attacks.
- **Password Uniqueness:** Reusing passwords can lead to compromised accounts.
- **2FA Usage:** Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security.
- **PGP Usage:** PGP encryption is widely used for secure communication.
- **PGP-Key Reuse:** Reusing PGP keys increases linkability and potential exposure.
- **Traceability of Cash-Out:** Cashing out to mainstream bitcoin exchanges can be traced and linked to real-world identities.

**3. Methodology**

To measure these security practices, we use four data sources:
- **Hansa Market Back-End Database:** Seized by Dutch law enforcement during Operation Bayonet.
- **Have I Been PWND Password Database:** Contains billions of leaked passwords.
- **Grams Search Engine Database:** Indexed listings and vendors across multiple markets.
- **Chainalysis Blockchain Analysis Service:** Tracks monetary flows between entities.

In the following sections, we describe our data, discuss ethical considerations, and present our measurement approach.

**3.1 Data**

**Hansa Market:** During Operation Bayonet in 2017, Dutch law enforcement infiltrated and took control of Hansa Market, collecting valuable data and disrupting the ecosystem. We were granted restricted access to the back-end data for in-depth analysis.

**Have I Been PWND:** This service aggregates login credentials from data breaches, providing a database of SHA1-hashed passwords. At the time of our analysis, the latest version contained over 10 billion leaked passwords.

**Grams:** A search engine for darknet markets, Grams indexed listings and vendors across multiple platforms. We matched records from the Hansa back-end with a copy of the Grams database acquired before its shutdown.

**Chainalysis:** This blockchain analysis service uses co-spend clustering heuristics to track transactions between bitcoin addresses, providing context to raw blockchain data.

In the subsequent sections, we will elaborate on the characteristics of vendors, cluster them into distinct types, and analyze their security practices. We will also discuss possible explanations for our findings, limitations, and implications of our work.
