### Challenges of Traditional CAPTCHAs
Solving traditional CAPTCHAs is not only difficult but also time-consuming for humans, with an average completion time of approximately 10 seconds. While behavioral CAPTCHAs, such as reCAPTCHA [18], are available, they raise privacy concerns because they require sharing user behavioral data with the CAPTCHA provider. These systems claim to be more efficient when used across multiple pages. In contrast, CACTI can provide at least equivalent abuse prevention as traditional CAPTCHAs while minimizing the burden on users and offering strong privacy guarantees.

### Human Presence Detection
Human presence detection involves determining whether specific actions were performed by a human. VButton [46] proposes a system design based on ARMâ€™s TrustZone [25]. It achieves secure detection of human presence by setting the display and touch input peripherals as secure peripherals, which can only be controlled by the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) while the VButton UI is displayed. With a secure I/O mechanism in place, user actions can be authenticated to originate from the VButton UI by a remote server using software attestation. Similarly, Not-a-Bot [42] designs a system based on Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs) by tagging each network request with an attestation that assures the request was performed shortly after a keyboard or mouse input by the user. Unfortunately, Intel SGX does not support secure I/O, making it impossible to implement similar systems on devices with only Intel SGX support. SGXIO [60] proposes an architecture for creating secure paths to I/O devices from enclaves using a trusted stack, which includes a hypervisor, I/O drivers, and an enclave for trusted boot. An untrusted virtual machine (VM) hosts secure applications, and communication between secure applications and drivers is encrypted using keys generated during the local attestation process. Although this system is promising, its implementation is not yet available. Fidelius [37] protects user secrets from a compromised browser or OS by securing the path from input and output peripherals to the hardware enclave. Similar to SGXIO, this is a step towards general-purpose trusted UI. If trusted UI capabilities become widely available on TEEs, these can complement our CACTI design, providing stronger assurance of human presence.

### Privacy Pass
Privacy Pass [35] is a browser extension that reduces the burden of CAPTCHAs for legitimate users visiting websites served by Cloudflare. When a user solves a CAPTCHA, Cloudflare sends the user multiple anonymous cryptographic tokens, which the user can later "spend" to access Cloudflare-operated services without encountering additional CAPTCHAs. While Privacy Pass significantly benefits benign users, it could still be exploited by CAPTCHA farms. Additionally, Privacy Pass is currently limited to Cloudflare users.

### Conclusion and Future Work
CACTI is a novel approach that leverages client-side TEEs to help legitimate clients avoid solving CAPTCHAs on the web. The unforgeable yet privacy-preserving rate-proofs generated by the TEE provide strong assurance that the client is not behaving abusively. Our proof-of-concept implementation demonstrates that rate-proofs can be generated in less than 0.25 seconds on commodity hardware, and CACTI reduces data transfer by more than 98% compared to existing CAPTCHA schemes. For future work, we plan to employ optimization techniques discussed in Section 7, implement and evaluate CACTI on ARM TrustZone using OpenEnclave, and explore new types of web security applications enabled by client-side TEEs.
