ABSTRACT
The Domain Name System (DNS) provides a scalable, flexible name
resolution service. Unfortunately, its unauthenticated architecture
has become the basis for many security attacks. To address this, DNS
Security Extensions (DNSSEC) were introduced in 1997. DNSSEC’s
deployment requires support from the top-level domain (TLD) reg-
istries and registrars, as well as participation by the organization that
serves as the DNS operator. Unfortunately, DNSSEC has seen poor
deployment thus far: despite being proposed nearly two decades ago,
only 1% of .com, .net, and .org domains are properly signed.
In this paper, we investigate the underlying reasons why DNSSEC
adoption has been remarkably slow. We focus on registrars, as most
TLD registries already support DNSSEC and registrars often serve
as DNS operators for their customers. Our study uses large-scale,
longitudinal DNS measurements to study DNSSEC adoption, cou-
pled with experiences collected by trying to deploy DNSSEC on
domains we purchased from leading domain name registrars and
resellers. Overall, we find that a select few registrars are responsible
for the (small) DNSSEC deployment today, and that many leading
registrars do not support DNSSEC at all, or require customers to take
cumbersome steps to deploy DNSSEC. Further frustrating deploy-
ment, many of the mechanisms for conveying DNSSEC information
to registrars are error-prone or present security vulnerabilities. Fi-
nally, we find that using DNSSEC with third-party DNS operators
such as Cloudflare requires the domain owner to take a number of
steps that 40% of domain owners do not complete. Having identified
several operational challenges for full DNSSEC deployment, we
make recommendations to improve adoption.

INTRODUCTION
1
The Domain Name System (DNS) [31] provides name resolution for
the Internet, mapping human-readable names (e.g., example.com)
to machine-routable IP addresses (among other things). As DNS was
designed without end-to-end authentication, attackers have leveraged
it as a basis for myriad attacks, such as DNS hijacking [7, 25] and
cache poisoning [38].
DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) [17] were proposed two
decades ago to address threats like these. DNSSEC allows clients
(typically DNS resolvers) to verify the integrity and authenticity of
DNS records. It has also been leveraged to enhance the security of
other protocols: For example, DANE (DNS-based Authentication of
Named Entities) [41] enables domain holders to publish their public
keys and authorized certificate authorities in DNS records.
DNSSEC derives its security properties from its hierarchical pub-
lic key infrastructure (PKI). The DNSSEC PKI establishes chains of
trust that mirror the structure of the DNS hierarchy, with the root of
trust in the DNS root zone. Critically, this means that a domain in
zone z can be authenticated only if all zones in the DNS hierarchy
from the root to z support DNSSEC. Fortunately, there has been
considerable work towards deployment near the top of the hierar-
chy. After the DNS root zone’s key was created in July 2010, many
top-level domains (TLDs) have become DNSSEC-enabled; recent
studies [23, 40] have reported that 90.5% of generic TLDs (gTLDs,
for example .com) and 47% of country-code TLDs (ccTLDs, for
example .nl) are now DNSSEC-enabled.
Unfortunately, even though most TLDs now support DNSSEC,
adoption by second-level domains (e.g., example.com) remains
quite low [4, 8, 29, 40, 49]; our recent work [8] shows that only 0.6%
of .com domains and 1.0% of .org domains have DNSKEY records1
published. Worse, even among those domains that did attempt to
deploy DNSSEC, we found significant levels of misconfiguration
that resulted in incorrectly signed DNSSEC domains. For example,
31% of domains that support DNSSEC fail to publish all relevant

records required for validation, meaning DNSSEC-enabled clients
are unable to validate their records.
In this paper, we explore why DNSSEC deployment remains so
small, and why there are high levels of misconfiguration of DNSSEC
records. We focus primarily on DNS registrars—the entities that
sell domain names and often operate the authoritative nameservers—
to better understand how different registrar policies have led to
the current state of affairs. Registrars play a critical role in the
deployment of DNSSEC, as domains where the registrar is the DNS
operator are entirely at the mercy of the registrar to support DNSSEC.
Even for domains where the domain owner is the DNS operator, the
registrar must still upload a DS record to the registry to complete the
DNSSEC deployment.
Most prior studies of DNS registrar behavior have relied on active
scans or large-scale data from zone files. Understanding what regis-
trars allow and how they behave, however, requires a different form
of measurement study: in this work, we examine large-scale, longi-
tudinal DNS measurements and provide the first systematic study of
the entire DNSSEC deployment process from a customer’s perspec-
tive (by purchasing domains from leading domain name providers).
Only by using this hands-on approach can we observe what domain
owners experience. Overall, we purchased domains from the most
popular 20 registrars (responsible for 54.3% of all .com, .net, and
.org domains), as well as the 10 registrars that operate the large
number of domains with DNSKEYs (covering 84.6% of such domains
in .com, .net, and .org). In many cases, we find that we have to file
support tickets or email the registrar in order to successfully deploy
DNSSEC.
We couple our hands-on registrar measurements with 21 months
of daily snapshots of DNSSEC records for all signed .com, .net,
and .org second-level domains, 11 months of daily snapshots of
DNSSEC-enabled .nl second-level domains, and seven months of
daily snapshots of DNSSEC-enabled .se second-level domains. We
choose .nl and .se as these have some of the highest levels of
DNSSEC support among TLDs [12]. Looking at this historical data
allows us to see how the policies we observe as a customer are
correlated with each registrar’s DNSSEC track record.
Individually, many of our results are anecdotal, but taken together,
they paint a picture of why DNSSEC deployment remains at 1%
of second-level domains, even though DNSSEC was originally pro-
posed 20 years ago. Concretely, we observe that:
• The support for DNSSEC is skewed to a small number of registrars.
Covering 50% of all .com, .net, and .org domains requires the
top 26 registrars, but covering the top 50% of those domains that
properly support DNSSEC requires just two registrars.
• Among the top 20 registrars, only three support DNSSEC when
the registrar is the DNS operator. Only one (NameCheap) does so
by default, and then only does so for some of their more expensive
plans. The other two registrars either require the customer to opt-in
(OVH) or to pay $35 per year (GoDaddy).
• Not all of the registrars we study support DNSSEC even when
the owner is the DNS operator. Of those that do, 12 provide a
web form for customers to upload DS records while seven require
human intervention by contacting the registrar (e.g., via email or
chat) to do so. We found most web forms to be inadequate (ten
of the 12 registrars do no validation), emails to present obvious
security vulnerabilities (four of the seven registrars did not verify
the authenticity of the incoming email, and one even accepted an
email from a different email address than the one that registered
the domain), and web chat to be error-prone (one of the registrars
accidentally installed our provided DS record on someone else’s
domain).
• Among the top 10 DNSSEC-supporting registrars, we find many
of them are from the Netherlands or Sweden. Historically, both
.nl and .se have provided financial incentives for registrars to
support DNSSEC (with auditing for compliance), and we observe
many registrars that properly support DNSSEC for these TLDs
but not for others.
• Finally, we examine how third-party DNS operators such as Cloud-
flare interplay with DNSSEC. We find the process of deploying
DNSSEC using these services to be error-prone, as customers
must obtain a DS record from the third-party DNS operator and
upload it to their registrar. This is done successfully by only 60%
of domain owners.
Taken together, our results uncover many of the reasons why
DNSSEC adoption has remained low, but provide ways forward
to better incentivize DNSSEC deployment. We have been respon-
sibly disclosing security issues to the registrars we interacted with,
but there is a long way to go before DNSSEC deployment becomes
simple, secure, and universally available to domain name owners.

Outline The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Sec-
tion 2 provides background on DNSSEC and Section 3 gives an
overview of related work. Section 4 provides more detail on the
TLDs that we study and our daily scans. Section 5 explores the
behavior and policies of the most popular registrars, while Section 6
examines the behavior and policies of the registrars with the largest
number of DNSSEC-enabled domains. Section 7 examines third-
party DNS operators such as Cloudflare, and Section 8 concludes.
2 BACKGROUND
In this section, we provide an overview of DNS, DNSSEC, and the
various entities involved in the management of the DNS infrastruc-
ture.
DNS and DNSSEC DNS is a distributed database that stores records
that map domain names to values. For example, the IP address of
example.com can be obtained by looking up the A record associated
with the name example.com. DNS’s logical namespace is divided
into zones, each of which represents a contiguous set of domain
names controlled by a single organization (e.g., the example.com
zone may control names like www.example.com, but may further
delegate *.test.example.com, thereby creating another zone).
2Our .com, .net, .org and .nl zone files are collected under
agreement with the zone operators; while we are not permitted to
release this data, we provide links where other researchers can obtain
access themselves. For the .se zone file, which is open data, we
release it through OpenINTEL [36].
Understanding the Role of Registrars in DNSSEC Deployment

Unfortunately, the original DNS protocol lacked many security
features (e.g., authentication of records), making DNS vulnerable to
numerous attacks, such as DNS hijacking [7, 25] and cache poison-
ing [38]. To defend against such threats, DNS Security Extensions
(DNSSEC) [1–3, 16] were introduced in 1997. DNSSEC employs
cryptographic mechanisms to verify records’ integrity and authentic-
ity. To achieve these goals, it is essential for each zone to provide
three record types:
DNSKEY records are public keys. Zones sign DNS records with the
corresponding private keys, and resolvers use the DNSKEY to
verify these signatures. Each zone usually creates two DNSKEY
records (called the KSK and ZSK) to sign DNS records: the
private key of the KSK is used to sign DNSKEY records, and
the private key of the ZSK is used to sign all other records.
RRSIG (Resource Record Signature) records are cryptographic sig-
natures of other records signed using a DNSKEY’s correspond-
ing private key. RRSIGs are applied to the set of all records
associated with a given name and type. For instance, all NS
records for example.org will be authenticated by a single
RRSIG.
DS (Delegation Signer) records are essentially hashes of DNSKEYs
that are uploaded to the parent zone by registrars. To ensure
integrity, DS records also need to be signed by the parent
zone (in the RRSIG of DS records). Hence DNSSEC can only
function correctly when there are valid DS records from root
to leaf, thereby establishing a chain of trust.
For more details on the correct validation of DNSSEC records, we
refer the reader to our previous work [8].
Registry, Registrar, Reseller, and DNS Operator Since much of
the focus of this paper is on the organizations that sell (and often host)
domains, we provide a brief overview here. There are four kinds
of organizations that play a role in the domain name registration
process.
Registries are organizations that manage top-level domains (TLDs);
each TLD has exactly one registry. The registry maintains
the TLD zone file (the list of all registered names within that
zone), and works with registrars to sell domain names to the
public. For example, Verisign serves as the registry for .com.3
In many cases, registries do not have any direct contact with
customers.
Registrars are organizations that are accredited by ICANN4 and
certified by registries to sell domains to the public. They have
direct access to the registry, which enables them to process
new registrations.
Resellers are organizations that sell domain names, but are either
not accredited (by ICANN) or certified (by a given TLD’s
registry). Typically, resellers partner with registrars in order
to sell domain names, and relay all information through the
registrar. For example, if a registrar wants to sell domains of
a TLD that it is not accredited to access, it can partner with a
registrar for that TLD, thereby becoming a reseller. Thus, a

ments.
given organization can serve as a registrar for certain TLDs
and a reseller for others.
DNS Operators are organizations that run authoritative DNS servers.
Each domain name has a DNS operator, and a given opera-
tor may serve as the authoritative DNS server for multiple
domains.
Whenever a registrar (or a reseller, via a registrar) sells a domain
name, it must update the registry. It provides several pieces of infor-
mation, but the two most crucial parts (and the parts of interest to
this paper) are two DNS records that get inserted into the TLD zone
file: the NS record set (the identity of the authoritative nameservers
of the DNS operator, referred to as delegation of the domain) and,
optionally, the DS record set (if the domain supports DNSSEC).
Throughout the remainder of the paper, we will refer to registrars
as the entities that sell domain names; this should be interpreted as
registrar or reseller. When the distinction becomes important, we
will note it explicitly.
Registrar vs. external DNS operator Many registrars offer cus-
tomers two options when purchasing a domain: (1) the customer can
ask the registrar to serve as the authoritative nameserver (i.e., the
registrar is the DNS operator), or (2) the customer can run their own
authoritative nameserver for its new domain (i.e., the owner is the
DNS operator). In the former case, the authoritative nameserver for
the domain will be listed as one in the registrar’s domain, and the
registrar usually provides the customer with a web-based interface
where they can modify the contents of their domain. For example, if
a customer purchased example.com from Bluehost and chose regis-
trar hosting, the NS record for example.com would be a machine in
the bluehost.com domain.
For domains that support DNSSEC, the responsibility for main-
taining DNSSEC records (e.g., DNSKEYs, RRSIGs, DS records) falls on
the DNS operator. If this is the registrar, and if the registrar supports
DNSSEC and manages DNSSEC correctly, it is the registrar who
will generate DNSKEYs and RRSIGs for DNS records. If this is the
owner, the owner must generate and maintain all DNSSEC records.
Uploading DS records If a domain operator wishes to support
DNSSEC, a DS record for the domain must be uploaded to the reg-
istry in order to establish a chain of trust. However, only registrars
can upload DS records to the registry.
Thus, if the domain’s DNS operator is the registrar, they can
simply upload the DS record by directly accessing the registry. Un-
fortunately, if the domain’s DNS operator is the owner, the situation
is more complicated because the owner must somehow convey the DS
record to the registrar. To this end, a registrar may provide customers
with a web-based interface to submit DS records, or may allow cus-
tomers to transmit DS records via an out-of-band mechanism such
as by e-mail or telephone. Moreover, if a registrar does not support
any methods for customers to upload DS records, the domain cannot
support DNSSEC as the domain’s chain of trust will be broken due
to the missing DS record. Hence, the registrars’ policy for uploading
DS records to the registry plays a crucial role in whether domains
purchased through that registrar can support DNSSEC.
For DNSSEC to function properly, it is essential that a complete
chain of trust (RRSIG, DNSKEY, and DS record) exists. Unfortunately,
this is often not the case. In this paper we distinguish between
partial and full DNSSEC deployments: A domain that publishes

T. Chung et al.
Figure 1: A diagram of full deployment vs. partial deployment
of DNSSEC by a domain. It is important to note that partially
deployed domains do not properly validate, as they are missing
DS records.
DNSKEY and RRSIGs and uploads DS records is called fully deployed
DNSSEC, while a domain that has DNSKEYs and RRSIGs but that
does not upload DS record (and therefore cannot be validated) is
called partially deployed DNSSEC as illustrated in Figure 1.
From a security perspective, a partial deployment has limited
value, since there is no way to verify DNSSEC signatures.5 This
makes it all the more important that DNSSEC deployment is done
correctly, as any missing link the chain would prevent a domain’s
records from being validated. In the remainder of this paper, we
study key points in the domain registration and operation process
where DNSSEC deployment breaks down and missing functionality
leads to partial deployments.
Automating DS uploads Uploading DS records manually or out-of-
band can be error-prone6 and can open up security vulnerabilities
(e.g., if an attacker can convince a registrar to accept an incorrect
DS record). To address these problems, the CDNSKEY (child DNSKEY)
and CDS (child DS) record types were introduced in 2014 [26, 46]. In
brief, these records automate DNSSEC delegation trust maintenance
by allowing an in-band mechanism for transmitting and updating
DS records. If a customer wants to replace its DS records with a new
one, the customer publishes a CDNSKEY or CDS record (or both) with
its RRSIG(s).7 Once the registry detects the presence of the CDNSKEY
