User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How to extract windows event logs from a hard disk forensic image? I have created an image of hard disk using FTK imager. I want to extract the windows event logs. The system was running windows 7. What should I do?

Assistant: Windows event logs are stored in the following locations by default:

2000, XP and 2003

C:\Windows\system32\config


Vista+

C:\Windows\system32\winevt\logs


Event and parameter message templates

The event and parameter message templates specific to each type of log are stored in DLLs (so you can interpret the messages and parameters in context for each log) and their location is stored in the Eventlog key in the Registry, located at:

HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\Eventlog


You can also use this key to validate that the event logs are being stored in their default location since an administrator can change this (such changes will be reflected within this key sub-path).

"Dirty" evt logs

When copying event logs off of a live system, for the older *.evt logs (2000, XP and 2003), they have a file status byte that sometimes can prevent reading the logs in standard viewers when it is an odd value. Fixing the logs is well documented, and there used to be a tool called fixevt.exe that made this easier but I don't know of a reliable download source so I'll leave this exercise to the reader to find it (the site where it used to be located indicates the hosting provider account was suspended).
