**ATT&CK ID:** S0595  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** ThiefQuest

When executed with root privileges, ThiefQuest installs a `.plist` file in the `/Library/LaunchDaemons/` directory. This file is configured with the `RunAtLoad` key set to `true`, which ensures that the malware is automatically launched at system startup, thereby establishing persistence as a Launch Daemon. [18]
