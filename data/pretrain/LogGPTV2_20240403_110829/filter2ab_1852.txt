**ATT&CK ID:** C0022  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Operation Dream Job

In the course of Operation Dream Job, the Lazarus Group employed a tactic for persistence by placing LNK (shortcut) files in the startup folders of the victims' systems. This method ensured that the malicious code would be executed every time the system was started, thereby maintaining long-term access to the compromised machines. [187]
