# Feature request
## Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
There are directories in "pages" whose contents should all have the same
layout. For example, an "articles" directory might have articles written in
.mdx, which compile to react elements. It would be very useful for all the
.mdx files under "articles" to have the same layout and shared logic.
## Describe the solution you'd like
Ideally, one could create an _app.js file for each directory. All files in
that directory would use that _app.js. Files in other directories with no
custom app would use pages/_app.js if that file exists.
## Describe alternatives you've considered
All the alternatives I've thought of seem to have the same problem, that the
routing information needs to be written in code somewhere, in addition to next
inferring that from the filesystem, which is redundant. For example, you could
just have a single pages/_app.js and some logic in there to figure out which
layouts to add to what. This makes it required to write out your routes in the
_app.js file. It's basically a router inside a router, so it's not the best
solution.
Another alternative is to keep the .mdx files (or react components) somewhere
outside of "pages", and import them in pages/articles.jsx for example. Then,
essentially implement a router that shows the proper component depending on
the route. Again, you're basically implementing a router within a router.
## Additional context
I'm new to next, so if there's something obvious I'm missing, I apologize.
