### Issue Description
The `requests` library is currently incompatible with `charset-normalizer` versions 3.0.0 and 3.0.1, preventing users from updating to the latest version of `charset-normalizer`.

### Expected Result
- The `requests` library should work seamlessly with the latest version of `charset-normalizer` (3.0.0 or 3.0.1).
- Users should be able to update `charset-normalizer` without encountering any issues.

### Actual Result
- When `requests` is used with `charset-normalizer` 3.0.0 or 3.0.1, it fails to function correctly.
- Users are blocked from updating `charset-normalizer` to the latest version.

### Reproduction Steps
1. Install `requests` and `charset-normalizer` 3.0.0 or 3.0.1:
   ```sh
   pip install requests charset-normalizer==3.0.0
   ```
2. Import `requests` in a Python script:
   ```python
   import requests
   ```

### System Information
To provide more detailed system information, run the following command and paste the output:
```sh
$ python -m requests.help
```
Output:
```json

  "paste": "here"
}
