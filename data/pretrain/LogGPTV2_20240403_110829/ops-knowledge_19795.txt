User: I have just started with Python. When I execute a python script file on Windows, the output window appears but instantaneously goes away. I need it to stay there so I can analyze my output. How can I keep it open?
Assistant: You can open PowerShell and type "python".
After Python has been imported, you can copy paste the source code from your favourite text-editor to run the code.
The window won't close.
