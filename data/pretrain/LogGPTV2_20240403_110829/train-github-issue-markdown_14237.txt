### Expected behavior
Memory should be freed when removing iframe
### Actual behavior
Memory is not freed
### How to reproduce
Create an app containing 50 iframes which should each load a heavy webpage
with images. Memory usage will increase a lot. If you remove the iframes from
the DOM, the memory usage is still as high as if the iframes were still there.
session.clearCache will not help.
