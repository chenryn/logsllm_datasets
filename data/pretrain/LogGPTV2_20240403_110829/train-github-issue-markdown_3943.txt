  * Electron Version: 2.0.2
  * Operating System (Platform and Version): Windows 10 (17134)
  * Last known working Electron version: N/A
**Expected Behavior**  
When maximizing a frameless window, then unmaximizing and then maximizing
again, there should not be a white bar atop the window.
**Actual behavior**  
The first maximize works. Removing maximize also works. Immediately maximizing
again (without resizing the window) leaves a white bar several pixels high
atop the browserwindow.
**To Reproduce**  
Use the latest Discord app (or various others like Spotify), follow the
workflow above to reproduce this very easily.
