I am unable to locate the DatePicker component after installing Material-UI.

- I have thoroughly searched the issues in this repository and believe that my issue is not a duplicate.
- I am currently using Material-UI for web, version 1.0.0-beta.4.

Could you please provide guidance on how to resolve this issue?
