### Observations on Training Data and Equal Error Rate (EER)

From the analysis of the three tasks—browsing, reading, and slideshow—we observe that the average EER decreases as more training data is used. For the browsing and reading tasks, the EER shows minimal changes beyond 10% of the training data. In contrast, for the slideshow task, diminishing returns only become evident after approximately 40% of the training data. This suggests that it is advantageous for the classifier to observe different illumination patterns, even with pupil diameter correction in place.

As discussed in Section 4.5, our system uses sequential training data to closely reflect real-world usage. The fact that the EER remains low indicates the effectiveness of this approach. Figures 8 and 9 illustrate the impact of training data selection (random vs. sequential) and the distribution of EER between users for the calibrated reading task, respectively.

### Pupil Diameter Correction and Cross-Task Authentication

For cross-task authentication, particularly between the slideshow task and the others, the system benefits significantly from pupil diameter correction. This is because the images in the slideshow are, on average, much darker than text on a white background. Applying the mapping function to the reading task reduces error rates by 39% and 59% for the target tasks. Interestingly, applying the function to the slideshow task as a source increases the EER. Therefore, it is practical to use the mapping function only for predictable source-target combinations, such as reading to browsing. This can be determined using population statistics without individual user input.

### Influence of Calibration

Table 4 demonstrates that similar or even lower error rates can be achieved with a generic (i.e., highly inaccurate) calibration. However, this reduction is partially due to binocular features becoming more distinctive when users exhibit diverse calibration errors. To measure the effect of calibration error in the calibrated experiment, we computed the correlation between the EER and calibration errors. Table 5 presents these correlations, showing a moderate positive correlation between pre-experiment calibration error and EER, although this was not statistically significant (p > 0.05) for any task. This supports our hypothesis that the system's effectiveness is not significantly affected by the quality of eye tracker calibration.

### Discussion and Security Analysis

In this section, we discuss four potential attacks on the system and possible countermeasures.

#### Manual Imitation
Imitation attacks involve the imposter modifying their eye movement behavior to mimic the victim. This requires the attacker to obtain information about the victim's eye movement patterns, which can be achieved through observation if the victim is using a compromised device with an eye tracker. However, the involuntary nature of eye movements makes them difficult to control consciously. Microsaccades, in particular, are extremely hard to suppress, and controlling them to alter biometric features seems virtually impossible. The pupil diameter, while somewhat controllable, is still challenging to manipulate, especially under the stress of an attack. Assuming the legitimate user’s calibration configuration is unknown, reproducing binocular tracking-based features in an uncalibrated setting is also difficult.

#### Light Stimulation
Attacks using light stimulation, such as changing ambient light through a dimmable desk lamp, have been proposed to alter the attacker's pupil diameter. While effective in some systems, our system uses ambient light correction. An ambient light sensor, rather than the light source’s dim settings, can be used to correct the pupil diameter, making such attacks ineffective. A more targeted light source, like a laser pointer, might avoid detection, but analyzing illumination differences between the eyes and the rest of the face could still reveal the attack.

#### Artificial Eyes
Using artificial eyes attached to a high-precision motor, it might be feasible to reproduce short-lived movements like microsaccades. Dynamically changing the pupil diameter could be achieved with a controllable shutter. However, this still requires the attacker to obtain a near-perfect copy of the legitimate user’s eye movement behavior. Additionally, liveness detection methods can distinguish between artificial and real eyes.

### Conclusion

In this paper, we propose a continuous authentication system based on eye movement biometrics. We address practical concerns such as the need for precise calibration, the effect of light sensitivity, and the task dependence of biometric features. Our results show significantly lower error rates than previous work, even in less controlled environments. We achieve an intra-task EER of 3.93% with only two minutes of uncalibrated training data, and our cross-task mapping can reduce the EER of cross-task authentication by up to 59%.
