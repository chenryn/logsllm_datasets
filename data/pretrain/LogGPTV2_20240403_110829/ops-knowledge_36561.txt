User: How to implement continuous integration/continuous deployment with Jenkins? Please give specific implementation steps and sample configuration files.
Assistant: Continuous integration and continuous deployment are important parts of the software development process that can be automated through Jenkins. Here we will use Jenkins to automate the steps and configuration example to build, test and deploy a simple Node.js web application. Steps: 1. Install Jenkins and start it. Here we assume that Jenkins is installed and running successfully. 2. Install the necessary plugins. Some plugins need to be installed in Jenkins to perform various build, test and deploy operations. Search for and install the following plugins in the Jenkins admin panel: - NodeJS Plugin (for building and testing Node.js applications) - Git Plugin (for pulling code from Git repositories) - Publish Over SSH Plugin (for publishing applications program to a remote server) 3. Create a Jenkins job. In the Jenkins admin panel, create a new build job and name it "myapp-ci-cd". 4. Configure Git source control. Enter the URL of the Git repository in the Source Control section, set the credentials, and select a code branch or tag so that Jenkins can pull code from the Git repository. 5. Configure the build step. Select the Node.js installer in the Build Environment section. In the Build section, select Execute shell or Execute Windows command. Here we use a shell script. Here is an example script: ``` npm install npm test ``` 6. Configure post-build actions. In the Post-build Actions section, select the Post-build Actions tab, and then select the Send build artifacts over SSH action. Configure the SSH server, enter the SSH credentials and target path so that Jenkins can transfer the built application to the remote server. 7. Save and run. Click the "Save" button and start the build. Jenkins will pull the code, build the application, run the test cases, and transfer the built application to the target path on the remote server. Sample configuration file: Below is a sample Jenkins configuration file that builds and deploys a simple Node.js web application using the NodeJS Plugin, Git Plugin, and Publish Over SSH Plugin. ``` node { stage('Checkout') { git url: 'https://github.com/myuser/myapp.git', credentialsId: 'mycreds', branch: 'master' } stage('Build and test' ) { def mvnHome = tool 'nodejs14.17.3' sh "${mvnHome}/bin/npm install" sh "${mvnHome}/bin/npm test" } stage('Deploy to server') { sshPublisher( publishers: [ sshPublisherDesc( configName: 'My SSH Server', transfers: [ sshTransfer( sourceFiles: '**/*', removePrefix: '/', execCommand: 'cd /home/myuser/myapp && npm install && npm restart', remoteDirectory: '/home/myuser/myapp', excludes: '' ) ] ) ] ) } } ```
