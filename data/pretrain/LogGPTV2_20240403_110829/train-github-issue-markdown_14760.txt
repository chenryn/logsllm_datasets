# Environment
    Windows build number: 10.0.19013.0
    Windows Terminal version (if applicable):0.6.2951.0
    Any other software? PSReadLine 2.0.0
# Steps to reproduce
Copy a PowerShell function at least twice the height of the terminal window to
the clipboard. Right-mouse click paste the code in to terminal.
# Expected behavior
The pasted function works as expected.
# Actual behavior
The terminal window content area "flashes". Somewhere along the way an error
appears--usually, but not always, after a closing brace (}). The error is,
reported in red text, "Oops, something went wrong...Report on GitHub:
https://github.com/lzybkr/PSReadLine/issues/new". The issues happens on PS 5.1
and PS 6.
Pasting the same code in to a non-terminal PS 5.1 works as expected with the
same version of PSReadLine.
