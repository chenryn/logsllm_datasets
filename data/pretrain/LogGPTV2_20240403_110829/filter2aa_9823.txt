If you have upload access to a non-/cgi-bin directory, you can upload an `httpd.conf` file and configure your own interpreter. For more details, refer to the Busybox `httpd.c` source code:

**Busybox `httpd.c` Reference:**
- [GitHub Link](https://github.com/brgl/busybox/blob/abbf17abccbf832365d9acf1c280369ba7d5f8b2/networking/httpd.c#L60)

### Configuration Example:
```plaintext
*.php:/path/to/php  # Run *.php files through the specified PHP interpreter
```

### Notes on Subdirectory Configuration:
- If a subdirectory contains a configuration file, it will be parsed and merged with any existing settings as if it were appended to the original configuration.

### Important Considerations:
- **Line Endings:** Be cautious of Windows-style CRLF (Carriage Return Line Feed) line endings, as they can cause issues and result in 404 errors. These line endings may not be visible in tools like Burp Suite, so ensure that your configuration files use Unix-style LF (Line Feed) line endings.

By following these steps and considerations, you can effectively configure your own interpreter for specific file types within the web server environment.
