I have both Go 1.3.3 and Go 1.4 installed on my system. 

To start, I cleared the `$GOPATH/pkg` directory. When I ran `go test ./...` using Go 1.4, all tests completed successfully.

Next, I cleared the `$GOPATH/pkg` directory again and updated my `PATH` to point to Go 1.3.3. However, when I ran `go test ./...` this time, the tests failed, resulting in multiple errors with the same message: 
```
object is [darwin amd64 go1.4 X:precisestack] expected [darwin amd64 go1.3.3 X:precisestack]
```

It appears that the issue arises when there is an import from another repository, suggesting that the updated `PATH` might not be properly propagated.
