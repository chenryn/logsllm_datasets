I have both go 1.3.3 and go 1.4 installed.
I start by cleaning my $GOPATH/pkg directory.  
Running go test ./... with Go 1.4 completes successfully
I clean my $GOPATH/pkg directory again.  
I set my PATH to point to Go 1.3.3  
Running go test ./... fails  
I end up with many errors all with the same error  
object is [darwin amd64 go1.4 X:precisestack] expected [darwin amd64 go1.3.3
X:precisestack]
It seems to be a problem the moment you have an import in some other repo.
Almost like the updated PATH isn't being passed along.
