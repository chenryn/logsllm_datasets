Troubleshooting Failures with ETH-SLM | 339
Use this topic to understand the guidelines for configuring synthetic loss measurement and how to start
a synthetic loss measurement session. There are two types of synthetic loss measurement sessions:
proactive and On-Demand. This topic describes both. Also, the topic shows you how to view and clear
the synthetic loss measurement statistics and how to troubleshoot failures with SLM.
Guidelines for Configuring ETH-SLM
Keep the following points in mind when you configure the ETH-SLM functionality:
325
• The monitoring application for Ethernet OAM is initiated in the primary Routing Engine. When a
stateful switchover process occurs, the monitoring application is disabled. For on-demand ETH-SLM,
graceful Routing Engine switchover (GRES) support is not applicable. For proactive ETH-SLM, the
service-level agreement (SLA) iterators are restored during a stateful switchover process. If the
adjacencies do not time out, the ETH-SLM statistics are preserved and proactive ETH-SLM supports
GRES.
• ETH-SLM is initiated only when the MEP session is up. Unified in-service software upgrade (ISSU)
support for ETH-SLM depends on the unified ISSU support for CFM. For CFM, unified ISSU is
supported using the loss threshold TLV to avoid CFM connectivity loss during the upgrade. The
receiving or the destination MEP increases the threshold time during the termination of sessions. If
you start a unified ISSU operation when on-demand ETH-SLM is in progress, the SLM request and
reply messages are lost at the local Packet Forwarding Engine.
When an on-demand ETH-SLM is requested, if the local source MEP undergoes a unified ISSU, a
message is displayed stating that the MEP is undergoing a unified ISSU. If the remote MEP is
undergoing a unified ISSU (detected through the loss threshold TLV), a message is displayed stating
that the remote MEP is undergoing a unified ISSU. Also, if it is not possible to identify whether
unified ISSU is in progress on a remote MEP, the SLM packets are lost at the system where unified
ISSU is in progress and the loss calculation results do not provide a valid cause for the loss. Unified
ISSU is not supported for both on-demand and proactive ETH-SLM.
• The maximum number of SLA iterator profiles that can be configured in the system is 255.
• ETH-SLM is not supported for virtual private LAN service (VPLS) (point-to-multipoint measurements
are not supported). The ETH-SLM frames are not generated with multicast class 1 destination
address. Similarly, ETH-SLM does not respond to ETH-SLM requests with multicast DA. ETH-SLM
for VPLS for point-to-point Ethernet connection is supported using directed unicast destination MAC
addresses, although point-to-multipoint topologies are not supported.
• A unicast destination address may be used in provisioned environments for point-to-point
connections. However, it requires that the unicast destination address of the downstream MEP must
have been configured on the MEP transmitting an alarm indication signal (AIS).
• ETH-SLM is not supported on downstream MEPs on label-switched interfaces (LSIs).
• ETH-SLM is supported on aggregated Ethernet (ae) interfaces
• The number of ETH-SLM sessions for proactive ETH-SLM that can be supported is limited to the
total number of iterators that can be supported in the system. This limitation includes the iterator
support for other measurement types such as loss, statistical frame loss, and two-way delay. A new
iterator type, SLM, is added to support ETH-SLM. The total number of SLA iterators that you can
configure in the system is equal to the total number of iterations supported in the system.
• For on-demand SLM, the minimum period between two SLM requests is 100 milliseconds.
326
• For proactive SLM, the minimum period between two SLM requests is 10 milliseconds for distributed
mode and 100 milliseconds for non-distributed mode.
• ETH-SLM frames are always marked as drop-ineligible in compliance with the ITU-T Y.1731 standard.

Configuring MEP Interfaces | 326
Configuring an Iterator Profile for ETH-SLM | 327
Associating the Iterator Profile with MEPs for ETH-SLM | 329
To start a proactive Ethernet synthetic loss measurement (ETH-SLM) session, you must configure the
Ethernet interfaces on maintenance association end points (MEPs) on which packets transmitted with
synthetic frame loss need to be analyzed. You must then create an iterator profile to transmit service-
level agreement (SLA) measurement packets for ETH-SLM and associate the local and remote MEPs
with the profile.
Configuring MEP Interfaces
Before you can start an Ethernet synthetic frame loss measurement session across an Ethernet service,
you must configure two ACX Series routers to support ETH-SLM.
To configure an Ethernet interface on an ACX Series router to support ETH-SLM:
1. On each router, configure two physical or logical Ethernet interfaces connected by a VLAN. The
following configuration is typical for single-tagged logical interfaces:
[edit interfaces]
interface {
ethernet-interface-name {
vlan-tagging;
327
unit logical-unit-number {
vlan-id vlan-id; # Both interfaces on this VLAN
}
}
}
Both interfaces will use the same VLAN ID.
2. On each router, attach peer MEPs to the two interfaces. The following configuration is typical:
[edit protocols]
oam {
ethernet {
connectivity-fault-management {
maintenance-domain md-name { # On both routers
level number;
maintenance-association ma-name { # On both routers
continuity-check {
interval 100ms;
hold-interval 1;
}
mep mep-id { # Attach to VLAN interface
auto-discovery;
direction (up | down);
interface interface-name;
priority number;
}
}
}
}
}
}
Configuring an Iterator Profile for ETH-SLM
You can create an iterator profile with its parameters to periodically transmit SLA measurement packets
in the form of ITU-Y.1731-compliant frames for synthetic loss measurement.
NOTE: ACX5048 and ACX5096 routers supports iterator cycle time of only 1 second and above.
To create an iterator profile:
328
1. In configuration mode, go to the following hierarchy level:
[edit]
user@host# edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management performance-monitoring
2. Configure the SLA measurement monitoring iterator:
[edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management performance-monitoring]
user@host# edit sla-iterator-profiles
3. Configure an iterator profile—for example, i1:
[edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management performance-monitoring sla-
iterator-profiles]
user@host# set i1
4. (Optional) Configure the cycle time, which is the amount of time (in milliseconds) between back-to-
back transmission of SLA frames for one connection, with a value from 10 through 3,600,000. The
default value is 1000 ms.
[edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management performance-monitoring sla-
iterator-profiles i1]
user@host# set cycle-time cycle-time-value
5. (Optional) Configure the iteration period, which indicates the maximum number of cycles per
iteration (the number of connections registered to an iterator cannot exceed this value), with a value
from 1 through 2000. The default value is 2000.
[edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management performance-monitoring sla-
iterator-profiles i1]
user@host# set iteration-period iteration-period-value
6. Configure the measurement type as synthetic loss measurement.
[edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management performance-monitoring sla-
iterator-profiles i1]
user@host# set measurement-type slm
329
7. Configure the disable statement to stop the iterator (that is, disable the iterator profile).
[edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management performance-monitoring sla-
iterator-profiles i1]
user@host# set disable
8. Verify the configuration.
[edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management performance-monitoring sla-
iterator-profiles]
user@host# show i1
cycle-time cycle-time-value;
iteration-period iteration-period-value;
measurement-type slm;
Associating the Iterator Profile with MEPs for ETH-SLM

2. Configure the remote MEP ID with a value from 1 through 8191.
[edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management maintenance-domain md-name
maintenance-association ma-name mep mep-id]
user@host# set remote-mep remote-mep-id
330
3. Set the iterator profile.
[edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management maintenance-domain md-name
maintenance-association ma-name mep mep-id remote-mep remote-mep-id]
user@host# set sla-iterator-profile profile-name
4. (Optional) Set the size of the data TLV portion of the Y.1731 data frame with a value from 1 through
1400 bytes. The default value is 1.
[edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management maintenance-domain md-name
maintenance-association ma-name mep mep-id remote-mep remote-mep-id sla-iterator-profile
profile-name]
user@host# set data-tlv-size size
5. (Optional) Set the iteration count, which indicates the number of iterations for which this connection
should partake in the iterator for acquiring SLA measurements, with a value from 1 through 65,535.
The default value is 0 (that is, infinite iterations).
