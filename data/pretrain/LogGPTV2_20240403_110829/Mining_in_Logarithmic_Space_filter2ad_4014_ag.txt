is online, succinct, and secure against all minority (1/3) adversaries.
All of these are necessary prerequisites to achieve the desired goal
of logarithmic-space mining. Our probabilistic analysis techniques
can also be leveraged to significantly simplify the previous analy-
ses of the above protocols.
Proof of Stake. Our protocol only works for Proof-of-Work block-
chains. It seems that our techniques cannot be readily adapted to
the Proof-of-Stake setting. The probabilistic nature of 𝑄-blocks
and predictable stochastic processes are a by-product of the mining
process and the nature of the random oracle model. Simple ideas do
not work. If we allow the block producers to annotate their blocks
with an appropriate level and sign it, the adversary can fake this. If
instead we take a stochastic property of blocks, the adversary can

only putting in stake, leading to an adversarial advantage, since
this is a setting where only stake majority assumptions are made.
It remains an open question whether the consensus data of stake
blockchains can be compressed.

APPENDIX
A MATHEMATICAL BACKGROUND
Theorem A.1 (Chernoff bounds). Suppose {𝑋𝑖 : 𝑖 ∈ [𝑛]} are
mutually independent Boolean random variables, with Pr[𝑋𝑖 = 1] =
𝑝, for all 𝑖 ∈ [𝑛]. Let 𝑋 =
𝑖=1 𝑋𝑖 and 𝜇 = 𝑝𝑛. Then, for any 𝛿 ∈
(0, 1],
Pr[𝑋 ≤ (1 − 𝛿)𝜇] ≤ 𝑒−𝛿2𝜇/2 and Pr[𝑋 ≥ (1 + 𝛿)𝜇] ≤ 𝑒−𝛿2𝜇/3.
Lemma A.2. For each 𝑗 ∈ N, let 𝐹 𝑗 and 𝑀𝑗 be Boolean random
variables such that E[𝑀𝑗] = 𝜁 and 𝑀𝑗 is independent of 𝐹𝑖 for 𝑖 ≤ 𝑗
and independent of 𝑀𝑖 for 𝑖 ≠ 𝑗. For any 𝜖 ∈ (0, 1),
𝐹 𝑗 𝑀𝑗 ≥ 𝑘

Proof. Since
it suffices to show that

In the summations below, let 𝛼 range over words in {0, 1}∗ and 𝛽
be any word in {0, 1}ℓ of weight 𝑘. For a fixed 𝛼, define 𝐽𝛼 = { 𝑗 ∈

N : 𝐹 𝑗 = 1} and 𝐵 = (𝑀𝑗) 𝑗 ∈𝐽𝛼 . Also, for 𝑗 ∈ N, let 𝐸 𝑗 denote the
event {(∀𝑖 < 𝑗)(𝐹𝑖 = 𝛼𝑖 and 𝑖 ∈ 𝐽 ⇒ 𝑀𝑖 = 𝛽𝑖)}. Then,
Pr[𝐵 = 𝛽] =
Pr[𝐵 = 𝛽, 𝐴 = 𝛼]

𝛽
Thus, letting 𝛽 range over all words in {0, 1}∗ of length less than
𝑘(1+𝜖)𝜁 and weight 𝑘 ending with 1, the left-hand side of (6) is equal
to
(
)
∑
Pr[𝐵 = 𝛽] ≤
𝑘≤ℓ< 𝑘(1+𝜖)𝜁
ℓ − 1
𝑘 − 1
𝜁 𝑘(1 − 𝜁)ℓ−𝑘 .
That is, the probability is at most that of a random variable fol-
lowing a negative binomial distribution with parameters 𝑘 (the
number of successes) and 𝜁 (the probability of success) is less than
𝑘(1+𝜖)𝜁 . The bound follows from standard Chernoff bounds.
