### 3.4 Content Checker
The content checker is designed to analyze the types of gambling, the content on illegal gambling sites, and the structural similarity of gambling webpages. To attract potential players, illegal gambling sites typically display all available game types on their homepage. This characteristic allows us to extract game types without needing to register or log into the sites. We manually checked the HTML templates and found that most of them include payment information on the homepage. Therefore, we can also extract the quick payment page without registration or login.

We extract pairs of payment information (i.e., anchor text and link) corresponding to the online payment channel from each webpage in Sites–≥amble. If the text contains payment content, we mark it as a potential payment link. We then crawl pages based on all potential payment links and use the structure similarity check method mentioned above. We cluster online payment webpages based on the HTML templates they use. Finally, we manually verify each template to confirm whether the webpage using the template is indeed a payment page. The details of this process are illustrated in Figure 5.

### 4. MEASUREMENT

#### 4.1 Overall Statistics
We conducted a measurement study on illegal gambling websites and their auxiliary modules. Through this study, we gained a deeper understanding of how illegal online gambling sites operate, how they abuse network infrastructure, and how they generate profit.

#### 4.2 Gambling Categories
Among the 967,954 identified illegal online gambling sites, we investigated different types of gambling and their popularity. We extracted gambling categories from the HTML content by analyzing its structure and keywords, and then clustered similar titles using text2vec [30]. The top five main clusters of gambling categories are:
- Lottery Ticket (LT, 49.35%)
- Electronic Games (EG, 24.22%)
- Entertainment Center (EC, 10.96%)
- Chess and Card (CC, including mahjong, 9.70%)
- Live Video (LV, 5.76%)

Lottery tickets are the most popular category, likely due to their simplicity and familiarity, such as sports lotteries. For lottery tickets, the top 10 subtypes, which make up more than 20% of this category, include Shishi Cai and Liuhe Cai, aligning with findings from previous studies [8, 37].

For electronic games, the top 5 types are:
- EG Games (6.22%)
- MG Games (4.98%)
- PT Games (3.91%)
- AG Games (3.44%)
- BBIN Games (2.91%)

Most electronic games are named based on their content or the company that designs and develops them. The top 5 types account for more than 20% of electronic games.

Chess and card games, such as Baccarat and Slot Machine, are well-known types of gambling. The top 5 types are:
- Chess Card Games (8.22%)
- Baccarat in Macao (4.65%)
- Slot Machine (4.08%)
- MG Slot (4.03%)
- Baccarat (3.87%)

Live video of the gambling place has become increasingly integrated into websites, allowing players to audit the gambling process. However, it has been reported that live videos can be faked. In our study, we focused on the ratio of video providers and found that the top 5 providers occupy 42.69% of live video gambling, including:
- Reality Show (18.21%)
- AB Live Video (8.70%)
- CG Live Video (8.03%)
- LMG Live Video (4.61%)
- BG Live Video (3.14%)

Finally, we examined the companies behind entertainment centers, which are brands shared among different gambling websites. The top 5 types of entertainment centers are:
- Crown Sports (7.42%)
- Jinsha in Macao (4.78%)
- Pujing in Macao (3.72%)
- Pujing Gambling (1.89%)
- Newest Crown Site (1.33%)

These entertainment centers are owned by one of the six companies in Macao: SJM, MGM, Wynn, Melco PBL, Galaxy, and VML, indicating that Macao dominates the online gambling business.

#### 4.3 Promotion Strategy
In some countries or regions, advertising gambling sites is prohibited, yet players still access these sites. We investigated how illegal gambling sites attract players, despite two major challenges:
1. It is impossible to identify and crawl all advertisements due to their large quantity.
2. There are no links in the illegal gambling sites leading to upstream promotion sites.

To address these challenges, we leveraged data indexed by search engines. We obtained webpages crawled by Baidu's bots in a whole day and identified promotion webpages containing hyperlinks or embedded advertisements for illegal gambling sites. We detected 106,340,755 webpages, labeled as Sitepromition, and classified these promotion webpages using the method described in Section 3.3.

Our results, shown in Table 1, indicate that most promotion webpages are also gambling sites, forming a dense link graph. The second type of site is porn, and the third is blackhat SEO. Surprisingly, blackhat SEO sites are not the most frequently employed method, suggesting that gambling and porn sites are more effective in promotion.

#### 4.4 Network Infrastructure
We inspected the distribution of suspected illegal gambling sites across different TLDs (Top Level Domains), IP addresses, registrants, and registrars. All these network components are often abused in setting up illegal gambling sites.

**TLD Distribution:**
In 2011, ICANN opened registration for new gTLDs [29]. Due to low prices and loose regulation, domains under new gTLDs have attracted attention from the underground economy [8]. Our results show that traditional TLDs are still favored, with the top 10 popular TLDs associated with more than 96% of gambling domains, consisting of 7 traditional TLDs and only 3 new gTLDs. Nearly 60% of illegal gambling websites use the .com TLD. Although registering a domain under .cn requires an ICP (Internet Content Provider) license in China [26], it is the second most popular TLD, suggesting potential flaws in ICP regulation.

**IP and AS Distribution:**
We also examined how illegal gambling sites are hosted. We queried Farsight passive DNS [10] and Qihoo 360 passive DNS [2] to get the present and historical IP addresses of all domains and identified their ASes using ip2asn tables provided in [18]. Table 3 lists the top 10 ASes and their country distribution, showing that 9 of the top 10 ASes are located in the US, possibly due to different regulations.

**Registrar and Registrant Distribution:**
WHOIS information of a domain includes its registration information, such as registrar and registrant. We queried this information for all domains. Despite the enforcement of GDPR, which led most registrars to stop providing WHOIS information to the public, we completed our query before GDPR took effect [2]. The top ten registrars are listed in Table 5. Interestingly, all registrars except GODADDY.COM are located in China, indicating potential regulatory flaws.

We extracted registrant email addresses and listed the top ten registrants who own the most domains. Table 5 lists registrants who have not set privacy protection, and Table 6 lists those who have set their email addresses as private. By comparing these tables, we see that Table 6 has about 5.5 times more domains, implying that illegal gambling websites extensively use privacy settings to hide their owners' identities. Some email addresses, such as yu*in*pi*PI:EMAIL, have appeared in previous works [8, 37], suggesting that these shady registrants can maintain their businesses over long periods and serve various underground activities.

#### 4.5 Abuse of Third-party Cloud Storage
Illegal gambling sites use attractive images to decorate their websites and draw users' attention. Most of these images are stored in third-party storage. We investigated how third-party storage is abused for this purpose. Illegal gambling sites also embed external JavaScripts stored in third-party storage, but this is not covered by our measurement because most JavaScripts used are common libraries like jQuery.

We extracted hyperlinks pointing to storage in HTML `<img>` tags from illegal gambling sites. Table 7 lists the categories of these storage services. We observed that illegal gambling sites prefer third-party cloud storage over CDNs, likely due to content check mechanisms enforced by CDN providers. Table 8 lists the URLs of the top 10 abused storage sites. A typical example of image hosting is Sina blog, where sinaimg is the fifth largest site serving images to illegal gambling sites. We extracted 1,214 Sina Weibo accounts from 229,972 identified sinaimg links, suggesting that a small group of Sina Weibo accounts provide image storage for over 200,000 illegal gambling sites. These Sina Weibo accounts are likely operated by the owners of illegal gambling sites.

#### 4.6 Use of Online Customer Service
Gambling websites offer customer service through three main methods:
1. **Message Board:** A page where customers can leave messages and will be contacted later.
2. **Live Chat:** Real-time chat with customer support.
3. **Email Support:** Customers can send emails for assistance.

These methods help ensure that customers receive timely and effective support, enhancing the overall user experience.
