site more or less. We label these upstream sites of illegal
gambling sites as Sitespromotion.
3.4 Content Checker
The content checker aims at analyzing the gambling types,
the content in the illegal gambling sites, and the structure
similarity of gambling webpages. In order to increase the
attraction to potential players, illegal gambling sites present
all the game types they can offer in the homepage. We can
leverage this characteristic to extract the game types with-
out registering or logging into gambling sites. We manually
check all the HTML templates, and find that most of them
payment usually appears in the homepage of illegal gambling
websites. Therefore, we can extract the quick payment page
without registration or login. We extract the pair of payment
information (i.e., anchor text and link) corresponding to the
online payment channel from each webpage in Sitesдamble.
If the text contains the payment content, we mark it as po-
tential payment links. Then we crawl pages according to
all potential payment links, and use the structure similarity
check method mentioned above. We cluster online payment
webpages based on the HTML template they use. Finally, we
manually check each template to confirm whether the web-
page using the template is a payment webpage. The details
of the process are shown in Figure 5.
4 MEASUREMENT
4.1 Overall statistics
We conduct a measurement study on the illegal gambling
websites and their auxiliary modules. Through the measure-
ment, we obtain a deeper understanding about how illegal
online gambling sites operate, how they abuse network in-
frastructure and how they gain profit.
4.2 Gambling Categories
Within the 967,954 identified illegal online gambling sites, we
investigate different types of gambling and the popularity
of each type. We extract gambling category from HTML
content by analyzing its structure and keywords. Then we
cluster similar titles using text2vec [30]. We find the top five
main clusters of gambling categories are lottery ticket (LT,
49.35%), electronic games (EG, 24.22%), entertainment center
(EC, 10.96%), chess and card (CC, including mahjong, 9.70%)
and live video (LV, 5.76%). From the result we can see that
lottery ticket is the most popular gambling category. We
infer this is because lottery ticket is one of the easiest games
to play and players are familiar with the lottery games such
as sport lottery.
For lottery ticket, Figure 6 shows the top 10 subtypes,
which comprises more than 20% of this category. Among
them, Shishi Cai and Liuhe Cai are the most popular, which is
in accordance with the discoveries of prior relevant works [8,
37].
For electronic games, the top 5 types are “EG Games”
(6.22%), “MG Games” (4.98%), “PT Games” (3.91%), “AG Games”
(3.44%) and “BBIN Games” (2.91%). Most of electronic games
are named according to their game content or the corpora-
tion that designs and develops the game. The top 5 types
make up more than 20% of electronic games.
Chess and card games, such as Baccarat and Slot Ma-
chine, are better known types of gambling. We find the top
5 types are “Chess Card Games” (8.22%), “Baccarat in Macao”
Figure 5: Example of Quick Payment.
put the type title in  tags. After extracting all the game
type titles, we employ NLP similarity tools (e.g., text2vec)
to cluster different game type titles based on their semantic
distance.
Besides game types, images play an important role in ille-
gal gambling websites. They make illegal gambling websites
more attractive while costing much more storage resources.
In order to know more details on how illegal gambling web-
sites store their image resources, the content checker also
extracts all the image links from illegal gambling webpages.
To analyze the structure similarity of those webpages in
Sitesдamble, we first extract all the HTML tags and sort them
in the order that they appear in the HTML file. Then we uti-
lize a python library for HTML similarity clustering named
“page-compare” [13] to calculate the similarity between every
two pages. This step is time-consuming because it needs to
compare every two pages and time complexity is N × (N −1)
if we have N pages. We deploy this step into Baidu Hadoop
cluster servers, costing 2,000 computational nodes 14 days
to finish.
3.5 Payment Extraction
We conduct a measurement study on online third-party pay-
ment channels. Note that traditional extraction methods are
impossible to extract the online third-party payment chan-
nels from illegal gambling websites, since it requires us to
register on each website and then make actual online pay-
ments to finish the extraction. We find a new payment chan-
nel in illegal online gambling sites named quick payment,
which can be utilized by researchers to extract payment in-
formation quickly and precisely without registration. In a
quick payment scenario, a player can make a payment even
without logging into the sites. The player just needs to fill the
account name, the payment amount, and select a payment
method. After that, the player will be redirected to a payment
webpage to complete the online payment. The entry of quick

(4.65%), “Slot machine” (4.08%), “MG Slot” (4.03%) and “Bac-
carat” (3.87%). We can see that Baccarat and slot machine
are also common games in illegal gambling sites.
Live video of the gambling place is integrated by more
and more websites in recent years since it can audit how the
gambling process goes. Illegal gambling sites present live
video of the gambling room with a mobile phone. If players
suspect the video is fake, he can call that mobile phone and
look for the sight of mobile ringing and shining in the video.
However, it has been reported that live video can be faked
to show the mobile phone feature [1]. In this work, we do
not check the trustworthiness of the video while we focus
on the ratio of video providers. We count the top 5 providers
and find that they occupy 42.69% in live video gambling,
including “Reality Show” (18.21%), “AB live video” (8.70%),
“CG live video” (8.03%), “LMG live video” (4.61%) and “BG
live video” (3.14%).
Finally, we look into the companies behind the entertain-
ment centers, which are brands shared among different gam-
bling websites. The top 5 types of entertainment centers
in our result are “Crown Sports” (7.42%), “Jinsha in Macao”
(4.78%), “Pujing in Macao” (3.72%), “Pujing Gambling” (1.89%)
and “Newest Crown site” (1.33%). All these entertainment
centers are owned by one of the 6 companies in Macao: SJM,
MGM, Wynn, Melco PBL, Galaxy and VML [36]. This result
shows Macao dominates the online gambling business.
4.3 Promotion Strategy
In some countries or areas, advertising the gambling sites is
not allowed but still there are players accessing the sites. We
want to investigate how these illegal gambling sites attract
players but there are two major challenges: (1) It is impossi-
ble to identify and crawl all advertisements due to their large
quantity. (2) There is no link in the illegal gambling sites that
can lead the visitor to the upstream promotion sites. To ad-
dress those chalenges, we leverage the data indexed by search
engines. We obtain webpages that Baidu’s bots crawl in a
whole day, and identify promotion webpages which contain
hyperlinks to or embed advertisements of the illegal gam-
bling sites. We detected 106,340,755 webpages. This dataset
is labeled as Sitepromition. Then we classify these promotion
webpages with the method describe in Section 3.3.
We show our results in Table 1. We can see that most of
promotion webpages are also gambling sites. They link to
each other to form a dense link graph. The second type of
site is porn and the third is blackhat SEO. Blackhat SEOers
prefer leverage the high rank website to promote illegal gam-
bling sites, such as compromised websites with high rank.
Surprisingly, blackhat SEO sites are not the most frequently
employed method, which implies that gambling sites and
porn sites are more effective in promotion.
4.4 Network Infrastructure
In this section, we inspect the distribution of suspected ille-
gal gambling sites in different TLDs (Top Level Domains), IP
addresses, registrants / registrars. All these network compo-
nents are abused in setting up a illegal gambling site.
TLD Distribution. In 2011, ICANN opened the registra-
tion for new gTLD [29]. Due to the low price and loose
regulation by the new gTLD registrars, domains under new
gTLDs have attracted a lot of attention from underground
economy [8]. Table 2 lists the distribution of illegal gambling
sites across TLDs. On the other hand, our result shows tradi-
tional TLDs are still favored: the top 10 popular TLDs, which
are associated with more than 96% gambling domains, con-
sists of 7 traditional TLDs and only 3 new gTLDs. Nearly 60%
of illegal gambling websites use TLD .com. Although regis-
tering a domain under .cn requires an ICP (Internet Content
Provider) license in China [26], it is the second most popular
TLD, suggesting there may be flaws of ICP regulation.
IP and AS Distribution. We are also interested how the
illegal gambling sites are hosted. We get the present and
historical IP addresses of all domains by querying the APIs
provided by Farsight passive DNS [10] and Qihoo 360 passive
DNS [2]. Then we identify their ASes using the ip2asn tables
provided in [18]. Table 3 lists top 10 ASes and their country
distribution. We can see that 9 of the top 10 ASes are located
in US, possibly because of different regulation law in US.

Registrar and Registrant Distribution. WHOIS infor-
mation of a domain contains its registration information like
registrar and registrant, and we inquiry this information
for all domains. While recently due to the enforcement of
GDPR, most of the registrars stopped to provide WHOIS
information to public, we are able to finish our query before
GDPR come into effect 2 fortunately. The top ten registrars
are listed in Table 5. It is interesting that the registrars except
GODADDY.COM are all located in China, which implies the
flaws of regulation in China’s domain registration.
2https://eugdpr.org/
Then we extract registrant email addresses and list study
the the top ten registrants who own most of domains. Table 5
lists the registrants who has not set privacy protection and
Table 6 lists the registrants who has set email address as
private. By comparing these two tables, we can see Table 6
has about 5.5 times more domains than Table 5 in total. This
implies that illegal gambling websites extensively employ
privacy setting to hide their owners’ identities. Moreover,
we find some email addresses (e.g., yu*in*pi*PI:EMAIL)
have also shown in previous works [8, 37], suggesting those
shady registraints are able to keep their business running
for long time and serving completely different underground
businesses.
4.5 Abuse of Third-party Cloud Storage
We find that illegal gambling sites utilize beautiful images to
decorate their websites and attract users’ attention, most of
which are external images stored in third-party storage. We
investigate how third-party storage is abused for this pur-
pose. Illegal gambling sites also embed external javascripts
stored in third-party storage but this is not covered by this
measurement. This is because most of javascripts that il-
legal gambling sites use are common javascript libraries,
like jQuery hosted in https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/
jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js, so there is no pattern unique to
them. Nonetheless, images in illegal gambling websites are
often different from what are observed on legal sites.
We extract hyperlinks pointing to storage in HTML tag
 from illegal gambling sites. Table 7 lists the categoris of
those storage. We observe that illegal gambling sites prefer
third-party cloud storage rather than CDN. We infer this
is due to the content check mechanism enforced by CDN
providers. We list the URLs of the top 10 abused storage sites
in Table 8. A typical example of image hosting is shown in
Sina blog 3. In our measurement, sinaimg is the fifth largest
site serving images to illegal gambling sites. Since sinaimg
provides information to locate Sina Weibo 4 account who has
uploaded this images, we extract 1,214 Sina Weibo accounts
from the 229,972 identified sinaimg links. The result shows
that a small group of Sina Weibo accounts provide image
storage for more than 200,000 illegal gambling sites. We
speculate that these Sina Weibo accounts are likely to be
operated by the owners of illegal gambling sites.
4.6 Use of Online Customer Service
There are three main ways for gambling websites to offer
customer service to their customers: (1) Message board. Gam-
bling website creates a page for the customer to leave mes-
sage, and the customer will be contacted later on. However,
