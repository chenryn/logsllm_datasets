## ðŸš€ Feature
Add `nbytes` and `itemsize` methods to Tensor. It has the same semantics as
https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.15.0/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.nbytes.html
and
https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.15.0/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.itemsize.html
(though, in keeping with PyTorch style, it is a function call, not a
property).
## Motivation
The primary motivation is that caffe2::Tensor has these two methods, it's used
somewhat frequently in the Caffe2 codebase, and it seems like a generally
useful thing to have around.
## Alternatives
  * Don't add them, and make users do the computation themselves. This might be a little annoying to do, because if we don't have `itemsize()` the user has to compute it themselves from the dtype.
