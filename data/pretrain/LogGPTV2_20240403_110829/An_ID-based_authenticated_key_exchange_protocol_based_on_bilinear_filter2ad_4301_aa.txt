ABSTRACT
In this paper, we present a new ID-based two-party authen-
ticated key exchange (AKE) protocol, which makes use of a
new technique called twin Diﬃe-Hellman problem proposed
by Cash, Kiltz and Shoup. We show that our scheme is
secure under bilinear Diﬃe-Hellman (BDH) assumption in
the enhanced Canetti-Krawczyk (eCK) model, which better
supports the adversary’s queries than previous AKE mod-
els. To the best of our knowledge, our scheme is the ﬁrst
ID-based AKE protocol provably secure in eCK model.

INTRODUCTION
Authenticated key exchange is a traditional primitive of
cryptography.
It enables two parties, Alice (A) and Bob
(B), to establish a shared session key via unsecured channels.
Later, the shared session key can be used to eﬃciently ensure
data conﬁdentiality and integrity between A and B using
eﬃcient symmetric encryptions and message authentication
codes.
A key exchange protocol is said to be authenticated key
exchange protocol if both parties are ensured that no other
principals aside from their intended peers may learn the es-
tablished session key. A key exchange protocol is said to
provide key conﬁrmation, if both parties are sure that the
intended peers really hold the session key. A protocol which

is an authenticated key exchange with key conﬁrmation pro-
tocol is called AKC protocol.
In ID-based cryptography, a trusted key generator cen-
ter (KGC) generates the user’s private key when given the
user’s identity which is his/her public key. The ID-based
cryptography greatly simpliﬁes the management of certiﬁ-
cates. In ID-based AKE protocols users use the ID-based
public/private pairs to perform key exchange protocols in-
stead of using traditional PKI public/private pairs. It is de-
sirable for ID-based authenticated key exchange protocols
to possess the following attributes:
1.Known-key security: Each run of the protocol should
result in a unique secret session key.
It is reasonable to
assume the adversary has the ability to learn the session keys
except for one under attack. A protocol is said to be known-
key secure if the compromise of one session key should not
compromise other session keys.
2.Forward security: If the static private key of an entity is
compromised, the adversary can arbitrarily masquerade as
that entity in future. However, we want to guarantee that
when the static private key is compromised, the adversary
can not obtain the session keys that were accepted before the
compromise. Protocols are said to provide perfect forward
security if the static private keys of all parties involved have
been compromised without compromising the previously es-
tablished session keys by these entities. There is further
notion of forward security in ID-based setting, which we call
KGC-forward security (KGC-fs). The KGC-fs means that
even the compromise of KGC master private key does not
compromise the previously established session key. How-
ever, if the adversary is actively involved with the choice of
the DH values X, Y at a session, no two-message AKE pro-
tocol can achieve forward security, according to the result
of HMQV [13]. So we deﬁne weak form of forward security
(wFS).
3.Key compromise impersonation resistance: When the
static private key of an entity, say A, is compromised, the
adversary can arbitrarily masquerade as A in future. How-
ever, we want to guarantee that in this case the adversary
cannot masquerade as another entity, say B, to communi-
cate with A.
4.Ephemeral key reveal resistance: The adversary can ob-
tain the ephemeral key of entities. Protocols are said to be
ephemeral key reveal resistance if even when the adversary
obtains the ephemeral key of entities the session key under
attack still remains secure.
Protocols for AKE have been established to be surpris-
ingly diﬃcult to design. Bellare and Rogaway [2] ﬁrstly pro-
posed a formal security model for authentication and key
distribution. Since then, there have been several extensions
to the model [3, 1, 6]. Among them, the Canetti-Krawczyk
(CK) model [6] is regarded as possibly promising one. Choo,
Boyd and Hitchcock [10] compared the most commonly used
security models for key exchange. All these models attempt
to cover these desirable properties listed above as many as
possible.
Recently, LaMacchia, Lauter and Mityagin [15] present a
new security model for AKE protocols named eCK which
is considerably strong one. The desirable properties of eCK
model include resistance to key-compromise impersonation
(KCI), weak perfect forward security (wPFS) and resilience
to the leakage of ephemeral private keys etc. In this paper,
the eCK model is actually an slight adaption of eCK model
from PKI-based setting to ID-based setting.
1.1 Related Work
Currently, there are a great deal of ID-based authenti-
cated key exchange protocols in literature. Some of them
have been shown to be insecure or have no security proof,
others are only proven secure in weak models [18, 9, 11, 16]
(e.g. they do not fully support both the adversary’s Session-
KeyReveal and EphemeralKeyReveal queries).
Kudla and Paterson [14] propose a modular proof ap-
proach to the design of AKE protocols, which makes use of
gap assumption [17] to keep the consistency of random ora-
cle queries. While the approach is elegant and suitable for
the security analysis of many key exchange protocols, the
gap assumption may not be acceptable at all, since there
may not exist any polynomial time algorithms to construct
such a decision oracle in the real world.
Wang [19] proposes an ID-based AKE protocol with secu-
rity based on a decisional bilinear Diﬀe-Hellman (DBDH)
problem by using a computational oracle to support the
SessionKey Reveal queries. However, nobody knows how
to construct the computational oracle using any polynomial
algorithm in the real world.
Chen, Cheng and Smart [8] propose a new approach to
solve the reveal queries issue. Their approach incorporates
a built-in decision function in key exchange protocols. The
built-in decision function is designed to distinguish a Diﬃe-
Hellman (DH) triple from a random element in group G. It
is well known that in groups equipped with pairings such de-
cision problem is available. So their approach does not make
use of any oracle which may not exist in the real world. How-
ever, although their modiﬁed Bellare and Rogaway (mBR)
model fully support SessionKeyReveal queries, it does not
deal with the EphemeralKeyReveal queries.
Chow and Choo [12] propose a family of ID-based au-
thenticated key exchange protocols based on their challenge-
response signature technique. They claim that their protocol
allows SessionKeyReveal queries in all cases, and Ephemer-
alKeyReveal queries in most cases, without employing any
gap assumption. While this is certainly a contribution, as
the simulator has no peer’s static private key, their proto-
col cannot deal with the adversary’s EphemeralKeyReveal
queries to those sessions owned by the peer of Test session.
In fact, this is a main issue of security proof of authenticated
key exchange protocols. In this paper, we propose a better
solution to this issue.
We also note that recently some researchers focus on the
AKE protocols in standard model, among which, the work
proposed by Boyd et al. [5] is closely related to ours. They
propose a generic approach to the design of AKE proto-
cols based on a CCA-secure key encapsulation mechanism
(KEM) primitive. They show that the resulted protocol
is secure in CK model if the underlying KEM scheme is
CCA-secure in either the ID-based setting or the traditional
PKI-based setting. However, generally speaking, the generic
method is less eﬃcient than ours even if we consider it in
random oracle model. A detailed comparison is deferred to
section 6.
Cash, Kiltz and Shoup [7] recently proposed a new compu-
tational problem called twin Diﬃe-Hellman problem, at the
heart of which is the “trapdoor test” that allows us to imple-
ment an eﬀective decision oracle for the twin Diﬃe-Hellman
problem, without knowing the corresponding discrete loga-
rithm. We ﬁnd that the trapdoor test technique makes it
possible to remove the gap assumption in security proof of
AKE protocols. This provides another new approach to the
design of AKE protocols without gap assumption.
1.2 Our Contributions
For the ID-based AKE protocols to better deal with Ses-
sionKeyReveal and EphemeralKeyReveal queries, most of
previous protocols base their security on gap bilinear Diﬃe-
Hellman (GBDH) assumption, which is a basic technique for
the simulator to keep the consistency of random oracle.
Focusing on weakening the security assumption, in this
paper using the trapdoor test technique we propose a new
ID-based two-party AKE protocol. We show that the se-
curity of our protocol is based on BDH instead of GBDH
assumption. Moreover, Our scheme is proven secure in eCK
model, which better supports SessionKeyReveal and Ephemer-
alKeyReveal queries. To the best of our knowledge, our pro-
posal is the ﬁrst provably secure ID-based two-party AKE
protocol under BDH assumption in eCK model.
Compared to previous ID-based AKE protocols based on
gap assumption, our proposal has a more standard assump-
tion. On the other hand, compared to other ID-based AKE
protocols without gap assumption, our proposal has advan-
tages over them either in eﬃciency or in security model.
1.3 Organization
The paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we will re-
view the related building techniques. In section 3 we review
the eCK model. Then we propose our scheme in section
4. In section 5, we will give the security proof of the new
scheme in eCK model.
In section 6 we compare the eﬃ-
ciency between previous ID-based AKE protocols and ours.
Finally, concluding remarks are made in section 7.
2. PRELIMINARIES
Let the value k be the security parameter. Let G be two
cyclic groups of prime order q and P ∈ G be the generator
of group G. Deﬁne
CDH(X, Y ) := Z, where X = xP, Y = yP and Z = xyP .
CDH Assumption. For any probabilistic polynomial
time algorithm A,
P r[A(q, G, P, X = xP, Y = yP ) = CDH(X, Y )] ≤ (k).
where x, y ∈ Zq and (k) is negligible. The probability is
taken over the coin tosses of A, the choice of q, P and the
random choices of x, y in Zq.
Let e : G × G −→ GT be a bilinear pairing, where G, GT
be two cyclic groups of prime order q and P ∈ G be the
generator of group G. Deﬁne
BDH(X, Y, W ) := Z, where X = xP, Y = yP, W = wP
and Z = e(P, P )wxy.
BDH Assumption. For any probabilistic polynomial
time algorithm A,
P r[A(q, G, GT , P, X = xP, Y = yP, W = wP ) =
BDH(X, Y, W )] ≤ (k).
where x, y, z ∈ Zq, and where (k) is negligible. The prob-
ability is taken over the coin tosses of A, the choice of q, P
and the random choices of x, y and w in Zq.
The theorem below is a variant of trapdoor test theorem
[7]. As stated by authors of that paper, it is easy to check
that both proofs are similar, so we omitted the details. The
readers are referred to [7] for details.
Theorem 1
(Trapdoor Test [7]). Let e : G× G −→
GT be a bilinear pairing, where G, GT be two cyclic groups
of prime order q and P ∈ G be the generator of group G.
Suppose W1, r, s are mutually independent random variables
where W1 takes values in G, and each of r, s is uniformly
distributed over Zq, and deﬁne the random variable W2 :=
sP − rW1. Further, suppose that ˆX, ˆY are random variables
taking values in G and ˆZ1, ˆZ2 are random variables taking
values in GT , each of which is deﬁned as some function of
W1 and W2. Then we have:
(i) W2 is uniformly distributed over G;
(ii) W1 and W2 are independent;
(iii) if W1 = w1P and W2 = w2P , then the probability
that the truth value of
r · ˆZ2
ˆZ1
?= e( ˆX, ˆY )s
does not agree with the truth value of
?= e( ˆX, ˆY )w1(cid:94) ˆZ2
ˆZ1
?= e( ˆX, ˆY )w2
(1)
(2)
is at most 1/q; moreover, if (2) holds, then (1) certainly
holds.
Intuitionally, theorem 1 means that the simulator can use
(1) to judge whether (2) holds (Knowing either the discrete
logarithm ˆx of ˆX or the discrete logarithm ˆy of ˆY , the ad-
versary can compute ˆZ1, ˆZ2 itself, while the simulator can-
not). This technique is essential to implement the eﬀective
decision oracle without knowing the corresponding discrete
logarithms w1, w2 of W1, W2.
3. SECURITY MODEL
Our basic security model is the ID-based eCK model which
is actually a slight adaption of eCK model from the tradi-
tional PKI-based setting to the ID-based setting. In particu-
lar, it covers the KGC-fs in the freshness deﬁnition. Further
details of the original eCK model can be found in [15].
Participants. We model the protocol participants as a
ﬁnite set U of ﬁxed size with each IDi being a probabilis-
tic polynomial time (P P T ) Turing machine. Each proto-
col participant IDi ∈ U may execute a polynomial number
of protocol instances in parallel. We will refer to s-th in-
stance of principal IDi communicating with peer IDj as
i,j(i, j ∈ N ) (a session).
Πs
Adversary Model. The adversary M is modeled as a
P P T Turing machine and has full control of the communi-
cation network and may eavesdrop, delay, replay, alter and
insert messages at will. We model the adversary’s capability
by providing it with oracle queries.
• EphemeralKeyReveal(Πs
i,j) The adversary obtains
the ephemeral private key of Πs
i,j. These queries are
motivated by practical scenarios, such as if session-
speciﬁc secret information is stored in insecure memory
on device or if the random number generator of the
party is corrupted.
• SessionKeyReveal(Πs
i,j) The adversary obtains the
session key for a session s of IDi, provided that the
session holds a session key.
• StaticKeyReveal(IDi) The adversary obtains the
static private key of IDi.
• KGCStaticKeyReveal The adversary obtains the
KGC master private key, the query is used to model
the KGC forward security (KGC-fs).
• EstablishParty(IDi) The query models that the ad-
versary can arbitrarily register a legal user on behalf
