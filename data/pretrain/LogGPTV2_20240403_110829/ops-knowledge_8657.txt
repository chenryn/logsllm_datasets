User: How to load balance and optimize website performance? Please give a variety of options and program analysis.
Assistant: 1. Use a load balancer: put the servers into a cluster, and use a load balancing algorithm to distribute traffic. This approach guarantees high availability and scalability. 2. Static resource CDN distribution: The global distributed CDN service can distribute static pages, pictures, CSS files and other content to CDN nodes around the world to achieve global access acceleration. 3. Compressed data: Compressing data for transmission can reduce transmission volume and response time. 4. Use a cache mechanism: setting a cache in a web server or browser can reduce the amount of data transmitted from the server and improve user response speed. 5. Optimize database operations: optimize database structure, SQL queries can use indexes, limit the number of SQL statements, and do as few join operations as possible. 6. Control the page size: reduce the image and resource size of the page, reduce HTTP requests, and adopt lazy loading and other methods. 7. Use browser cache: The web server can tell the browser the expiration time of the file through the HTTP response header, and the browser can use the cache file within this time to reduce requests to the server. 8. Use asynchronous requests: Ajax and other technologies can be used to request the server asynchronously, reducing the number of page reloads and improving page response speed. 9. Increase server processing capacity: increase server processing capacity can be achieved by upgrading Internet servers, installing cache devices, and adding new servers.
