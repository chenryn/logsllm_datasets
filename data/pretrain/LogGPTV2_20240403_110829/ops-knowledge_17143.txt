User: folder watcher functions in a way that after a file comes into a folder it does something ( it reacts ). Is there a method , such that, before a file enters the folder, a check is made, if it's a successful check then only the file enters folder, otherwise it does not.
Assistant: There is no existing solution to my knowledge. But:

There is the inotify API, but that only gives out notifications of what just happened, i.e. you don't have any means to influence the result.
If that is an absolutely necessary requirement, intercepting operations on a filesystem level is the only universal choice, hacking either the kernel itself or using FUSE.
If you only want to monitor operations of a single process, you could intercept some calls using LD_PRELOAD to intercept some function calls like fopen() and fwrite().
