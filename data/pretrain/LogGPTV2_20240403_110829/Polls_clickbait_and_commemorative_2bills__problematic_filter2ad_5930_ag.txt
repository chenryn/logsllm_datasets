Table 8: Selected GSDMM Model Topic Count by Data Subset
To evaluate similarity to our training clusters we used Adjusted
Rand Index (𝐴𝑅𝐼) [38] and Adjusted Mutual Index (𝐴𝑀𝐼) [91] met-
rics implemented via Scikit-learn, accounting for possible imbal-
anced or balanced cluster sizes [72]. For evaluating intra-topic
similarity, we measured Homogeneity (𝐻) and for inter-topic sim-
ilarity, we measured Completeness (𝐶) [73], both via Scikit-learn.
As a general measure of topic quality, we recorded 𝐶𝑣 coherence
via Gensim, based on Röder et al [70].
Table 6 details the best performances by model during tuning and
testing. GSDMM performed the best (likely because it is designed
specifically for short text documents), with an 𝐴𝑅𝐼 = 0.4743, 𝐴𝑀𝐼 =
0.4438, 𝐻 = 0.5297, 𝐶 = 0.6328, and 𝐶𝑣 Coherence= 0.5457, and
thus was selected. These values are comparable to other GSDMM
results on Twitter data [16, 65, 86]. We ran the model on the top
parameters 8 more times and selected the best iteration for use in
our final results. The final GSDMM model produced 180 clusters
on the full deduplicated dataset.
Labels for topics were designated after reviewing random sam-
ples of ads from within the topic and incorporating term results
from c-TF-IDF, which utilizes a modified term frequency - inverse
document frequency (TF-IDF) algorithm to select important terms
from a given topic cluster [33].
Based on the performance of GSDMM on the overall dataset,
we further used GSDMM for topic modeling on the political ad
subsets of "political memorabilia" and "nonpolitical products using
political topics." To evaluate performance in the absence of a ground
truth, we measured 𝐶𝑣 coherence. For both subsets, we tuned pa-
rameters of topic count, alpha, and beta. After identifying the best

performing parameters, we ran the models 10 additional times each
before selecting the best iteration. The top "political memorabilia"
model achieved a 𝐶𝑣 coherence of 0.7109 with 45 topics, and the
top "nonpolitical products using political topics" model achieved
a 𝐶𝑣 coherence of 0.6777 with 29 topics. As before, we manually
labeled the largest topics after reviewing random samples of ads
from within the topic. However, due to the smaller topic sizes in
the political subsets as compared to the full dataset, we weighted
ads by their duplicate counts when generating c-TF-IDF results (e.g.
an ad with 10 duplicates would have its text weighted 10x).
Table 7 contains the GSDMM parameters used in our selected
GSDMM models by dataset subset, and table 8 details the topic
count by the end of each model’s runtime. For all three models,
topic labels were scaled up from the deduplicated subsets to the
full dataset.
C QUALITATIVE CODEBOOK
C.1 Methodology
We generated a qualitative codebook using grounded theory [56],
an approach for generating themes categories via observation of the
ground-level data. First, three researchers conducted a preliminary
analysis of around 100 political ads each, creating open codes de-
scribing the characteristics of ads. We met to discuss and organized
them into axial codes (i.e., multiple choice categories for different
concepts) that best addressed our research questions.
Using these codes, three researchers coded the 8,836 ads, meeting
multiple times during the process to iteratively refine the codebook
based on new data. To assess the consistency of the coding, all
coders coded a random subset of 200 ads, and we calculated Fleiss’
𝜅 (a statistical measure of intercoder agreement, 𝜅 = 0 indicates
zero, 𝜅 = 1.0 indicates perfect) on this subset. We achieved an
average 𝜅 = 0.771 across our 10 categories (𝜎 = 0.09), indicating
moderate-strong agreement [53].
Supplementing our qualitative codes, one researcher also labeled
each campaign-related ad with the advertisers’ name and legal
classification (e.g., 501(c)(4) nonprofit), using information such as
the “paid for” box in the ad, or the organization’s website.
C.2 Codebook Contents
Our codeboook included three mutually exclusive high-level themes:
(1) campaigns and advocacy ads, (2) political product ads,
and (3) political news and media ads. To account for technical
errors in crawling and classification, ads were classified as Mal-
formed/not political if the extracted text and/or image content
was incomplete or non-political, e.g., if screenshots failed to capture
the whole ad, pop-ups or other material covered the ad, multiple
ads were captured, incorrect model classification.
C.3 Campaigns and Advocacy Ads
We define campaign and advocacy ads as those that explicitly ad-
dressed or promoted a political candidate, election, policy, or call to
action. Within this category, we further define the level of election,
the purpose of the ad, and advertiser-related information.
C.3.1 Level of Election. Election level refers to candidate’s juris-
diction, e.g., Senate elections were classified as federal. Specific
codes of election level are: presidential, federal, state / local, no
specific election, none. These codes are mutually exclusive. Note
that "state / local" encompasses ballot initiatives and referenda as
well as candidates.
C.3.2 Purpose of Ad. Ad purpose is mutually inclusive, meaning
one campaign and advocacy ad can be assigned multiple purposes,
e.g. voter information coupled with promoting a candidate. We
coded for five purposes: promote candidate or policy; poll, petition,
or survey; voter information; attack opposition; fundraise.
C.3.3 Advertiser Affiliation and Organization Type. To facilitate
insights into the advertisers, we identified their political affiliation
and type of organization (both mutually exclusive). First, we labeled
each advertiser by name, using information from the ad content
and/or the landing page (e.g., disclosures that say “Paid for By...”).
Then, for each advertiser, we investigated their legal organization
status, based on criteria developed by Kim et al. [41]. Organizations
listed on the Federal Election Commission website, or state elections
boards were labeled as Registered Committees. 501(c)(3), 501(c)(4),
and 501(c)(6) tax-exempt nonprofits, and legitimate foreign non-
profits that were visible in the Propublica Nonprofit Explorer or
Guidestar were labeled as Nonprofit organizations. Advertisers
whose websites’ home pages were news front pages were labeled
as news organizations (regardless of their legitimacy). Elections
boards, state Secretaries of State, or any other state or local gov-
ernment institutions were labeled as Government Agencies. Adver-
tisers who ran poll ads, and were listed FiveThirtyEight’s Pollster
Ratings were labeled as poll organizations. Ads from corporations
and other commercial ventures were listed as businesses. Any ads
where the advertiser was not identifiable was listed as unknown.
We also attempted to determine the political affiliation of the
advertiser. We coded affiliations as Democratic party, Republican
party, or independent if the advertiser was officially associated
with those political parties (local or national branches), or a candi-
date running under that party’s ticket. Codes of right/conservative,
liberal/progressive, and centrist apply to advertisers not officially
associated with a party, but that explicitly indicate their political
alignment with words like "conservative" or "progressive", either in
the ad itself or on their websites. Nonpartisan affiliation refers to
explicitly nonpartisan advertisers or nonpartisan election positions,
e.g. some local sheriff offices.
C.4 Political Product Ads
We define political products ads as those centered on selling a prod-
uct or service, using political imagery or content. This is further
delineated into three mutually exclusive subcategories: political
memorabilia, nonpolitical products using political topics, and polit-
ical services.
C.4.1 Political Memorabilia. Political memorabilia includes all ads
marketing products with some form of political design, e.g. 2nd-
amendment-themed apparel, keepsakes such as election trading
cards, and merchandise such as Trump flags. This encompasses
products sold for profit and those marketed as free or giveaways.
C.4.2 Nonpolitical Products Using Political Topics. We coded ads
as nonpolitical products using political topics if they used political

messaging or context to advertise products ordinarily unrelated to
politics. For instance, this covers investment firms marketing their
stock reports in the context of election uncertainty.
C.4.3 Political Services. Political services includes ads promoting
services directly involved in political industry such as lobbying or
election prediction sites.
C.5 Political News and Media Ads
We define political news and media ads as those advertising a
specific political news article, video, program, or event, regardless
of the content style or quality. This categorization encompasses
political clickbait and tabloid-style coverage of political figures as
well as traditional news and media. We further define two mutually
exclusive subcategories: sponsored articles / direct links to stores,
and news outlets, programs, and events.
Sponsored Articles / Direct Links to Stories. We coded ads
C.5.1
as sponsored articles / direct links to stories if they advertised a
specific news article or media piece, e.g. an authored story or video
regarding a current event. We automatically assigned 1,038 ads to
this category from Zergnet, a well-known content recommendation
company, as we determined via their advertisement methods that
all ads from their domain fit this category.
C.5.2 News Outlets, Programs, Events, And Related Media. News
outlets, programs, and events ads are distinguished from sponsored
articles / direct links to stories in specificity, longevity, or reference.
This category includes ads for political news outlets (as opposed
to individual news pieces), lasting programs such as NBC election
shows (in contrast to a single media clip), or future events such as
panels or livestreams (rather than already existing news). We also
included ads that were related media, such as podcasts, books, and
interviews.
D WORD FREQUENCY ANALYSIS OF
POLITICAL NEWS ADS
Unique Word Frequency Analysis. We looked at the most common
words in political article ads by first deduplicating ads (Sec. 3.2.2),
then tokenizing and lemmatizing the ad text. The top 10 words and
their frequencies, as well as a word cloud of the top 50 words, is
shown in Fig. 15. Among the top 50, we find frequent mentions of
“trump” (1,050 times, more than double the next most common word,
“biden”), as well as other politically relevant terms and names. Many
of top 50 words reveal the general tone of these article ads, which
often emphasize urgency, e.g., “new,” “top,” or scandal, e.g., “just,”
“claim,” “reveal,” “watch.” The colloquialism “turn heads” was par-
ticularly common, e.g., “What Michigan’s Governor Just Revealed
May Turn Some Heads.”

E ADDITIONAL AD SCREENSHOTS
Other Misleading Campaign Ads: Phishing Ads and Memes. Though
many campaign and advocacy ads in the dataset were potentially
misleading or factually incorrect, we highlight two types that ap-
peared particularly egregious.
In December, the Republican National Committee ran ads that
imitate a system alert popup, like an impersonation attack (Fig-
ure 16a). We found 162 ads of this style in our dataset. Though the
popup’s style is outdated, it is generally misleading for ads and
websites to imitate operating system dialogues or other programs.
Before the general election, the Trump Make America Great
Again Campaign launched several attack ads in the style of an
“image macro” meme. They featured
(obviously) doctored photos of Joe Biden, holding Chinese flags,
handfuls of cash, or depicting him approving of rioting (Fig. 16b).
We found 119 meme-style ads in our dataset. Though attack ads and
smears are fairly normalized, we did not observe the use of memes
for attacks by any other campaigns. These ads contrast with more
polished ads placed by other campaigns, and could be misleading if
users assume meme-style ads are placed by other
users, not an official political campaign.
