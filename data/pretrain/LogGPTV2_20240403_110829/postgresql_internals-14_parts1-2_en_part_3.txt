TOAST
Each row must fit a single page: there is no way to continue a row on the next
page.Tostorelongrows,Postgreusesaspecialmechanismcalled1(The

T implies several strategies. You can move long attribute values into a sep-

If the main table contains potentially long attributes, a separate  table is
created for it right away,one for all the attributes. For example,if a table has a

For indexes, the  mechanism can offer only compression; moving long at-

external implies that long attributes are stored in the  table in an uncom-

It may sometimes be useful to change the default strategy for some of the col-
umns. If it is known in advance that the data in a particular column cannot be
compressed(forexample,thecolumnstoresimages),youcansettheexternal
strategy for this column; it allows you to avoid futile attempts to compress the
data.Thestrategycanbechangedasfollows:
=> ALTER TABLE t ALTER COLUMN d SET STORAGE external;

T tables reside in a separate schema called pg_toast; it is not included into
the search path, so  tables are usually hidden. For temporary tables,
pg_toast_temp_Nschemasareused,byanalogywithpg_temp_N.

Nevertheless, data compression and slicing require a lot of resources; the same
goes for restoring the original values. That’s why it is not a good idea to keep
bulky data in Postgre, especially if this data is being actively used and does

The server has to spawn a separate backend for each client. If many clients are
tryingtoconnect,itcanturnouttobeaproblem.
• Each process needs  to cache catalog tables,prepared statements,inter-

morememoryisrequired.
