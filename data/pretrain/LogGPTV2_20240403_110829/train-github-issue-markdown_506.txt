The source of the problem is JuliaData/DataFrames.jl#1730.
Here is a MWE:
    julia>     using Statistics
    julia>     function get_stats(col::AbstractVector, stats::AbstractVector{Symbol})
                   if :q25 in stats || :median in stats || :q75 in stats
                       try quantile(col, [.25, .5, .75]) catch end
                   end
                   if :min in stats || :max in stats
                       try extrema(col) catch end
                   end
                   if :mean in stats || :std in stats
                       m = try mean(col) catch end
                   end
                   if :std in stats
                       try std(col, mean=m) catch end
                   end
               end
    get_stats (generic function with 1 method)
    julia>     get_stats(Int[], [:min])
    Unreachable reached at 000000001F2D2ED9
The problem seems with the use of `m` in `std`. If we write `try std(col)
catch end` not to use `m` the problem stops to be present.
Strangely removing other `if`s also kills the problem. Note that the part of
the code that causes the problem is not even executed as we pass `[:min]` as
the second kewyord argument.
@JeffBezanson I know that there are many "Unreachable reached" issues, but I
could not find one that is exactly the same (but maybe it is a duplicate).
