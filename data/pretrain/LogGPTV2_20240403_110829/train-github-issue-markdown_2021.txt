Add Font Awesome Icons to all of our Buttons

buttons
#### Issue Description
In this challenge as you know the buttons for Like, Info and Delete you add
cool icons to the end of the text in each button. I am wondering why for the
trashcan on the delete button it goes off the previewer page and thus you
cannot see it. Makes it look not clean is this a bug or could there be
something I am missing about how the .col-xs-4 work?
