…Because of the difficulty in detection, the potential exists for
this crime to be happening substantially more frequently than 
anyone has documented to date...

Craig Barrett, then-CEO of Intel noted in 2006 that health care 
costs were a driving factor in Intel’s decision to pursue 
operations overseas. 
Who is paying for this?
Businesses
Governments
Ultimately – the consumer
Cutting Costs
Transmit them across a private network
Patients’ records can be shared easily 
among doctors and other health care 
providers

Human Services Press Release, 7/21/04
Digitize patient medical records
Cutting Costs
Reduction in medical errors
- Conversations with Sutter Health, 2008
Increased efficiency
Sutter Health:  88,000 medical errors 
prevented in first three years 
Better communication, especially between 
health care providers
Costs of Medical Errors
- “The Quality of Health Care Delivered to Adults in the 
United States,” New England Journal of Medicine; June 2003
~$17 to $29 billion per year
Costs of Medical Errors
- “To Err is Human: Building a Safer Health System;” Institute 
of Medicine, 2000, pg 26
98,000 deaths per year
“The very comprehensive and ubiquitous nature of the NHIN 
that makes it attractive also makes it a source of concern. If 
digitized medical records can move throughout a nationwide 
system easily and quickly, then that means that incorrect files,
factual data, etc. will also move easily and quickly between 
every doctor and hospital.”

“Certain kinds of fraud – such as falsification of medical 
records – probably would not be detected through current 
methodology… Some experts suggest that a statistically valid 
estimate of fraud might not be possible at all, given the covert
nature and level of evidence necessary to meet the legal 
definition of fraud.”
-Testimony given by Penny Thompson, Program Integrity Director, Health 
Care Financing Administration before the House Budget Committee Task 
Force on Health. (Federal News Service, July 12, 2000.)
Billions of Dollars and Computers:  Fraud
Accounts for 3-10% of all health care costs 
$120 to $500 billion per year
Demand for medical records?  ID Theft:
-Lack of health insurance
-Fear of losing current or future employment
Health Care Fraud:  Victims

In 2001, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission sued 
Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway Company after the 
company genetically tested or sought to test employees’ blood 
without their consent or knowledge. The testing was part of an 
examination for employees who had filed compensation claims 
for carpel tunnel syndrome; in response to the filing, the 
company wanted to know if those employees had a genetic 
predisposition to carpel tunnel syndrome. 
The case was settled out of court in 2002 
for $2.2 million.

“Medical identity theft often leaves its victims without 
substantive recourse or clear pathways to follow for 
help. Recovery for victims of medical identity theft may be 
difficult or impossible because of the lack of enforceable rights, 
and because the dispersed and often hidden nature of medical 
records.”

Hospital Penetration 
Tests:
Discreet analysis at other large hospitals suggest that this is 
a widespread phenomena.
In this scenario, how does the "reasonable measures" clause 
compare with vulnerabilities discovered?
Hospital Networks:  Weak Spots
Hospital networks:  what’s unique?
Most areas open to the public 24/7
Security staff are accustomed to

Many systems use embedded Windows 
or Linux.
Providers are frequently unable to apply 
operating system patches due to 
software validation issues.
Few systems include anti-virus or anti-
spyware packages.
Most systems are connected to the 
provider’s production network.
