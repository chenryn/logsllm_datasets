User: I have a macOS Sierra 10.12.3 and I have installed Python 2.7.13 by downloading it from the official Python site.
When I type which python I get /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Version/2.7/bin/python. The python file referenced in this result is a shortcut for python2.7 file located in the same directory. 
I'm wondering what is the difference between Python (with the capital "P") file located in /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Version/2.7 and the one mentioned above? Thanks.
Assistant: python is alias name for current python binary. It's symlink to some version of python binary called Python. Something like 
/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Version/2.7/Python
/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Version/3.5/Python
Currently code for 2.7+ and 3.0+ may conflict (like use print(x) instead of print x or range for generators instead xrange in 2.7. etc).
So if your scripts are not ported for newest version you will probably catch a lot of errors while executing 
python my_cool_script.py 
because you wrote code for 2.7 and after installation you trying to execute it with 3.5 version. So you can change symlink back to Version/2.7/Python and execute the same command and it will work like you code it and version conflict will be solved.
