User: Configure domain controllers and AD DS roles on Windows Server
Assistant: Configuring domain controllers and AD DS roles on Windows Server requires the following steps: 1. Install the Windows Server operating system: Install the Windows Server operating system on the server to ensure that the operating system version meets the needs of your organization. 2. Install the Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) role: Go to Server Manager, click Add Roles and Features, click Next, and select Active Directory Domain Services. Complete all steps in the installation and configuration wizard. 3. Create a domain: In Server Manager, click Tools > Active Directory Domains and Trusts, and then click New Domain. Follow the wizard through the creation of the domain, including options for naming and assigning domain controllers. Once complete, you will have a new domain. 4. Install additional domain controllers: If you need to install domain controllers on additional servers to increase availability, failover, and reduce load, you can repeat steps 2 and 3 on each server. 5. Ensure correct network settings: Set DNS and IP settings correctly to ensure reliability and consistency of communication between domain controllers. 6. Configure security and permissions: In Server Manager, click Tools > Group Policy Management, and then make sure that all domain controller-related Group Policy settings are configured correctly. 7. Test the distribution: Make sure the domain controllers are healthy and accepting AD DS authentication requirements. 8. Domain controller backup and recovery: After creating the domain controllers, it is recommended that you back up the configuration so that it can be easily restored if something goes wrong.
