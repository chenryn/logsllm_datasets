### Title: Black Hat US-19: Inside the Apple T2 Security Chip

**Abstract:**

Apple's T2 Security Chip was introduced with the promise of bringing "a new level of integration and security" to the latest generation of Mac systems. The T2 chip includes a secure enclave coprocessor, which is used to protect Touch ID data, enable encrypted storage, and provide secure boot capabilities. In this presentation, we will delve into the inner workings of the T2 chip, going well beyond the limited technical details that Apple has publicly disclosed. We will also share our research methodology and the tools we developed, which we have released to the public, to help others learn from and build upon our work.

**Research Objectives:**

Our primary goal was to assess the current security posture of the T2 chip and to develop tools that would facilitate future research on the platform. Two key areas of focus were Apple's secure boot process and the communication between the T2 chip and macOS.

**Secure Boot Analysis:**

Our research into the secure boot functionality provides a detailed understanding of how the process works, what types of attacks it can mitigate, and where vulnerabilities may still exist. We will also discuss Apple's implementation of eSPI (Enhanced Serial Peripheral Interface) and its implications for potential attackers.

**Communication Protocol Reverse Engineering:**

In our exploration of the T2 chip's communication, we reverse-engineered Apple's proprietary XPC (XNU Process Communication) protocol, which had previously been almost entirely undocumented by third parties. We not only decoded the messaging format but also demonstrated the ability to interface directly with the T2 chip from unprivileged user space code by developing our own client application. Our talk will cover methods and tools for querying the T2's exposed services, as well as for decoding and encoding valid messages.

**Key Takeaways:**

- An in-depth understanding of the T2 chip's architecture and its role in enhancing system security.
- Insights into the secure boot process and the remaining attack surface.
- Knowledge of the T2 chip's communication protocols and how they can be interacted with.
- Access to the tools and methodologies we developed, enabling further research and development in this area.

By the end of the presentation, attendees will have a comprehensive understanding of how the T2 chip is implemented and the services it exposes to both the operating system and application layers.
