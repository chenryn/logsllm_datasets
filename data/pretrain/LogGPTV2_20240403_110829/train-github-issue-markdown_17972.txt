Our Weather Zipline example is now broken. Aparently the API @AdventureBear
used on her Zipline no longer works.

We need to find an API that works and doesn't require adding an API key, or we
need to make an API endpoint on Free Code Camp that campers can use (we don't
want people exposing API keys on CodePen).
Thanks to @martoncsikos for spotting this issue.
