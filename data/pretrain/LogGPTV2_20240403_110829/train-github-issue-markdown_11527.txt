This is a minor issue. When trying to install some packages through Atom's
packages > setting view > install packages/themes , a false error is given
(screenshot below), and the package is not installed. But apm can find git and
the packages install using the command line.
Atom version: 0.177.0  
Mac OSX: 10.9.5

Here's my `apm -v` output:
    > apm -v
    apm  0.134.0
    npm  2.3.0
    node 0.10.35
    python 2.7.5
    git 2.3.0
Installing via `apm install` works perfectly fine:
    > apm install linter
    Installing linter to /Users/trangpham/.atom/packages ✓
    > apm install merge-conflicts
    Installing merge-conflicts to /Users/trangpham/.atom/packages ✓
And then restarting atom shows the installed packages.
