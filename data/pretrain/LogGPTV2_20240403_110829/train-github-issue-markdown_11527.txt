### Issue Description

I have encountered a minor issue when attempting to install packages through the Atom interface. Specifically, when I navigate to **Packages > Settings View > Install Packages/Themes** and attempt to install a package, an erroneous message is displayed (screenshot below), and the package installation fails. However, the same packages can be installed successfully using the command line with `apm`.

### Environment Details
- **Atom Version:** 0.177.0
- **Operating System:** Mac OSX 10.9.5

### APM Version Information
```plaintext
> apm -v
apm  0.134.0
npm  2.3.0
node 0.10.35
python 2.7.5
git 2.3.0
```

### Command Line Installation
When I use the command line to install the packages, it works perfectly fine. For example:

```bash
> apm install linter
Installing linter to /Users/trangpham/.atom/packages ✓

> apm install merge-conflicts
Installing merge-conflicts to /Users/trangpham/.atom/packages ✓
```

After restarting Atom, the installed packages are visible and functional.

### Summary
- **Issue:** False error message and failed package installation via the Atom interface.
- **Workaround:** Successful installation using the `apm` command line tool.
- **Next Steps:** Investigate the cause of the false error in the Atom interface.
