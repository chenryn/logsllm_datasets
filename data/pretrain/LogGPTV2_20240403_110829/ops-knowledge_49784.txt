User: I'm extremely new to programming, in fact I'm trying to learn Python now as a first language. I found that Google has a python course and it said to download python 2 from python's website, which I did, and I now realize that python was already installed on my mac by apple. Anyways, I also had to download some exercises from google, and attempt to run some code in terminal and this is where I'm running into trouble and could really use some insight. 
First, the lesson said to simply type, python, into terminal to start coding in python (I don't know if this is the way to say that, or if that just gives you the ability to run python code?)
Then, it said to type in: python hello.py
Which was supposed to return: Hello World
However, all I keep getting is : 

SyntaxError: Invalid Syntax

And I don't really know where to go from here, I was thinking maybe it's due to me downloading python again when it was already installed, if it even was?
Assistant: python command will open a Python interpreter, where you can't run the python hello.py command so you got the syntax error (to run hello.py in python shell you need execfile(hello.py)) to quit the Python interpreter, type ctrl+d and than python hello.py to execute your hello world script.
