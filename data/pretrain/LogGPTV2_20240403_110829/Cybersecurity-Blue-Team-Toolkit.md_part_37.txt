privileges, remind them that they are the ones that hackers are
targeting.
Microsoft has guidance on implementing least privilege. For Linux, each
sysadmin should have a separate account and enforce the use of `sudo` by
disabling `su`. You should also change all default passwords on all
assets in your environment as well as making sure that each password is
as robust as possible. Use multifactor authentication and configure
systems to issue an alert if an admin mistypes his or her password.
The most secure admin credentials I\'ve personally used were on a
military network. My password was at least 16 characters, uppercase,
lowercase, special characters, and could not spell anything in Meriam
Webster\'s dictionary. I also had a lockout policy of one mistyped
password. I was logging into upwards of 40 to 80 machines multiple times
a day. If I locked myself out, I was basically in limbo for the rest of
the day because I had to call the help desk to have them reset my
password, which could take hours. That might be a bit extreme for the
[]{#c15.xhtml#Page_241 .pagebreak title="241"
role="doc-pagebreak"}average organization, but the fundamentals are the
same. By using robust passwords, limited privilege accounts, and a
lockout policy, you are making it more difficult for the attacker to
compromise your account or steal important data.

### Secure Configuration for Hardware and Software on Mobile Devices, Laptops, Workstations, and Servers {#c15.xhtml#head-3-18}
If you have ever opened a new laptop freshly imaged with an operating
system, you have to know that the default configuration you\'re working
on setting up is extremely vulnerable. There are open ports open and
services running and default accounts preinstalled for ease of use and
deployment, which are all exploitable. In Windows, for example, there
are a couple things you should do immediately after taking it out of the
box.
In [Lab 15.1](#c15.xhtml#c15-fea-0001){#c15.xhtml#R_c15-fea-0001},
you\'ll be securing a Windows workstation.

1.  [Enable system protection and create a restore point. If you
    accidently install a bad piece of software, you need a system
    restore point when everything was shiny and clean. (Strange, I know,
    but system protection comes disabled.) Search for **restore**, as

    you need to restore from one of these points, you can click the
    System Restore button on the System Protection tab. If you can\'t
    boot to a Windows menu, you can press F1, F8, or Shift+F8 during
    boot to get to the emergency menu on most computers. If F8 doesn\'t
    work, Google your make and model of laptop for boot menu

6.  [[]{#c15.xhtml#Page_243 .pagebreak title="243"

    extensions, so when you\'re browsing through your files, you can\'t
    easily see what type of file they are. Your résumé, for example,
    will appear as `myresume` instead of `myresume.docx`. Microsoft has
    been disabling extensions by default for the past several versions
    of its OS in a misguided effort to simplify the file system for
    users.]{#c15.xhtml#c15-li-0020}
    In an effort to protect you from yourself, Microsoft also hides
    certain operating system files from you by default. But what if you

### Maintenance, Monitoring, and Analysis of Audit Logs {#c15.xhtml#head-3-19}
Without appropriate logging, an attacker\'s activity could go unnoticed,
and evidence can be inconclusive. Regular log collection is vital to
understanding a []{#c15.xhtml#Page_247 .pagebreak title="247"
role="doc-pagebreak"}security incident during an investigation. Logs are
useful for baselines, trends, and support. At a minimum, log events
should include the following:
-   [Operating system events]{#c15.xhtml#c15-li-0031}
    -   [Startup/shutdown of the system]{#c15.xhtml#c15-li-0032}
    -   [Startup/shutdown of a service]{#c15.xhtml#c15-li-0033}
    -   [Network connection changes or failures]{#c15.xhtml#c15-li-0034}
    -   [Changes to, or attempts to change, system security settings and
        controls]{#c15.xhtml#c15-li-0035}
-   [OS audit records]{#c15.xhtml#c15-li-0036}
    -   [Logon attempts (successful or
        unsuccessful)]{#c15.xhtml#c15-li-0037}
    -   [Functions performed]{#c15.xhtml#c15-li-0038}
    -   [Account changes, including creation and
        deletion]{#c15.xhtml#c15-li-0039}
    -   [Successful/failed use of privileged
        accounts]{#c15.xhtml#c15-li-0040}
-   [Application account information]{#c15.xhtml#c15-li-0041}
    -   [Successful/failed application authentication
        attempts]{#c15.xhtml#c15-li-0042}
    -   [Use of application privileges]{#c15.xhtml#c15-li-0043}
-   [Application operations]{#c15.xhtml#c15-li-0044}
