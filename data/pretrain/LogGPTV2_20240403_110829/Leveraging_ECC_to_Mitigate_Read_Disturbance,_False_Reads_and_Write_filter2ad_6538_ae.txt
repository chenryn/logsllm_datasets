Fig. 8: Uncorrectable bit error rate vs. different row bit error rates under
ratios of read to write operations for single MTJ STT-RAM. All approaches
leverage ECC2.
Similarly, since WAT leaves cells with incorrect data, it follows
a similar trend to ECC2 but extends the useful range through
an additional data point making it useful for moderate rates
of read disturbance where ECC alone is not as successful. We
conclude that when the user read to write ratio increases, if
the read disturbance error rate is signiÔ¨Åcant and comparable to
other bit error rates from other factors, the system reliability
due to error mitigation policy varies signiÔ¨Åcantly. Thus, in the
remainder of the evaluation we conduct experimental results
on a ‚Äúworst-case‚Äù ratio of 1000 user reads to each user write
(a=99.9% vs. b=0.1%).
Table VI shows the UBER versus different RBERs for the
ratios of pf and pd speciÔ¨Åed in Table IV for a dual-MTJ
STT-RAM. Since dual-MTJ for STT-RAM reduce pf by more
than two orders of magnitude and increase pd and pw by
more than one and three orders of magnitude, respectively, the
relationships are different than in the single MTJ case. When
pf is the dominant error rate in the system, WAR, WAE and
WAP are more reliable than ECCk, where k is the number of
bits that can be corrected, and WAT. When the rate of pd grows
in comparison to pf and pw, WAR is more reliable than other
approaches due to its consistent write back to eliminate read
disturbance. However, WAR incurs a high energy overhead and
consumes signiÔ¨Åcant additional memory bandwidth for this
reliability beneÔ¨Åt. Moreover, writes are expensive operations
and signiÔ¨Åcant effort has been applied to reduce the impact
of writing into an MTJ. One method is to reduce the write
pulse width œÑ and tolerate a higher pw. If pw ‚â§ {pf , pd} then
WAR also becomes both expensive for energy and potentially
less reliable than other methods. In the following section, we
explore the trade-off between the system reliability and the
energy overhead for different approaches.
C. Energy Overhead Evaluation
We deÔ¨Åne the read energy overhead as the energy consumed
for all the system operations (write backs and second reads)
relative to the energy for all the user operations. That is, the
average increase in the energy needed for a user operation.
Assuming that every write operation consumes 4 times the
energy for a read operation [29, 30], the energy overhead for
WAR is 400% because each user read is followed by a system
write back. Fig. 9 breaks down the average energy overhead of
different error mitigation policies for a single MTJ STT-RAM.
Compared to WAR (400%), the average energy overhead of

Fig. 10: Comparing the average energy overhead of different approaches as
they utilize (a) ECC1, (b) ECC2. Parameters are for dual-MTJ STT-RAM.
WAE and WAP is less than 2% and 0.5%, respectively. As
long as the dominant error in the system is false read (as
is the case for the single MTJ conÔ¨Åguration), WAP reduces
energy overhead over WAE. When available (e.g., with ECC2)
WAT achieves a signiÔ¨Åcant energy savings particularly in cases
where pf dominates [Fig. 9 (b)]. For a dual-MTJ STT-RAM,
results in Fig. 10 shows that average energy overhead of WAE,
WAP, and WAT is very low, reaching 0.0397%, 0.0392%,
and 0.00002%, respectively. Compared to single MTJ STT-
RAM, dual-MTJ STT-RAM reduces average energy overhead
for these policies as pf is reduced by more than two orders
of magnitude. In fact, pf no longer dominates as pd and pw
increase by more than one and three orders of magnitude,
respectively and become higher than pf . Note that when pd
and/or pw is greater than pf (negative points of the vertical
axis in Fig. 10), the dominant errors are persistent. Thus,
WAP uses an additional read to detect persistent errors which
becomes less valuable, so its energy overhead becomes greater
than WAE, which immediately writes back on any error.
Accordingly, the double read by WAP and or the write back by
WAE after error detection can prevent the unnecessary system
operations while retaining an acceptable UBER level. WAT,
however, can dramatically reduce the average energy overhead
compared to other approaches as it can tolerate some cells
with incorrect data before writing back while still achieving a
satisfactory UBER for certain values of IR. We conclude that
writing back a data block after every read operation incurs
a large overhead and other approaches dramatically reduce
this energy overhead while achieving a similar or acceptable
UBER level.
D. Energy Reliability Product
Product metrics, such as Energy-delay product [34, 35] are
common to evaluate trade-offs between two metrics. To eval-
uate the trade-off between energy overhead and reliability, we
use the ERP metric, which we deÔ¨Åne as the product of the en-
ergy overhead times UBER. Thus, we utilize the ERP metric
to evaluate the efÔ¨Åciency of different approaches in a similar
fashion. While WAR can have signiÔ¨Åcant ramiÔ¨Åcations on
delay because every access incurs a write operation, as WAE,
WAP, and WAT do not write back data blocks frequently, and
additional reads from WAP are also infrequent, their delay
is negligible compared to WAR and small compared to ECC
alone. Fig. 11 shows that WAE and WAP for single MTJ STT-
RAM improve the energy reliability product by more than two
orders of magnitude compared to WAR for different ratios
of RBERs. Furthermore, when pf is greater than pd and pw,
WAT dramatically improves the energy reliability product by
more than two orders of magnitude versus WAE and WAP
and more than Ô¨Åve orders of magnitude compared to WAR.
When Pd dominates, the advantage of WAT further increases.
In dual-MTJ STT-RAM, the decrease in false read error
rate versus single MTJ STT-RAM results in WAE and WAP
improving the energy reliability product over WAR by roughly
the same degree, as shown in Fig. 12. When pd overtakes pf
(negative points of the horizontal axis), WAE and WAP obtain
the same energy reliability product due to similar UBERs and
energy overheads. However, when pd is high, WAE still has an
advantage over WAP which requires the second read to Ô¨Ålter
out false reads. Unsurprisingly, as pd increases, WAT does
not eliminate read disturbances effectively and the cumulative
effect of read disturbance causes the energy reliability product
to quickly drop below WAE and WAP as shown in Fig. 12 (b).
We conclude that although these approaches tend to deliver
a better system failure rate than other approaches, they can
incur a high energy overhead. Our evaluation based on energy
reliability product shows that WAT and WAR achieve the best
and worst performance, respectively for a single MTJ STT-
RAM in which the false read error rate is the dominant in the
system. In dual-MTJ STT-RAM where pd and potentially pw
