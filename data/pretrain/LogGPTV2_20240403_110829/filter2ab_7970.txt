To manage the security of individual COM (Component Object Model) applications, you can modify the following registry settings:

1. **Process-Wide Security for Individual COM Applications:**
   - **Registry Path:** `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\AppID\{AppID_GUID}`
   - **Modification Method:** Directly or using `dcomcnfg.exe`
   - **Purpose:** These settings control the security configuration for specific COM applications, identified by their unique `{AppID_GUID}`.

2. **System-Wide Security Defaults for All COM Applications:**
   - **Registry Path:** `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Ole`
   - **Modification Method:** Directly or using `dcomcnfg.exe`
   - **Purpose:** These settings provide a default security configuration for all COM applications that do not have their own process-wide security settings defined.

By adjusting these registry keys, you can enforce more granular and secure configurations for COM applications, both at the individual and system-wide levels.
