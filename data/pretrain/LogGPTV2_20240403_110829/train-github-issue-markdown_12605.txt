The conda-package for numpy does not work on Windows inside a tox environment
(using tox-conda):
Steps to reproduce are:
  * Set up a `tox.ini` that uses `tox-conda`
  * Define a `tox` environment that has `numpy` in `conda_deps`, either from the `default` or the `conda-forge` channel
  * Invoke `tox` such that `numpy` is imported inside the environment
The result in an error such as
    Traceback (most recent call last):

    IMPORTANT: PLEASE READ THIS FOR ADVICE ON HOW TO SOLVE THIS ISSUE!
    Importing the numpy c-extensions failed.
    - Try uninstalling and reinstalling numpy.
    - If you have already done that, then:
      1. Check that you expected to use Python3.8 from "C:\projects\2020-02-06-numpy-on-appveyor\.tox\envdir\python.exe",
         and that you have no directories in your PATH or PYTHONPATH that can
         interfere with the Python and numpy version "1.18.1" you're trying to use.
      2. If (1) looks fine, you can open a new issue at
         https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues.  Please include details on:
         - how you installed Python
         - how you installed numpy
         - your operating system
         - whether or not you have multiple versions of Python installed
         - if you built from source, your compiler versions and ideally a build log
    - If you're working with a numpy git repository, try `git clean -xdf`
      (removes all files not under version control) and rebuild numpy.
    Note: this error has many possible causes, so please don't comment on
    an existing issue about this - open a new one instead.
    Original error was: DLL load failed while importing _multiarray_umath: The specified module could not be found.
    ERROR: InvocationError for command 'C:\projects\2020-02-06-numpy-on-appveyor\.tox\envdir\python.exe' -c 'import numpy; print(numpy.__version__)' (exited with code 1)
The error occurs for Python versions 3.7 and 3.8, but not 3.6. It also only
occurs when installing the numpy package inside of tox (as opposed to just the
default conda environment directly)
I've set up a repository at https://github.com/goerz-
testing/2020-02-06_numpy_on_appveyor that illustrates several variations of
the problem. In that repository, the `tox.ini` defines a `run-cmd` environment
to execute arbitrary commands inside the environment. In `.appveyor.yml` I
then invoke tox to run
    python.exe -c "import numpy; print(numpy.__version__)"
inside the environment.
The repository reproduces the error on AppVeyor, but I've observed the same
behavior "manually" on a standard Windows 10 installation.
Variations of things that do and don't work are branches in the repository:
  * `master` branch: Python 3.8, numpy from conda-forge channel ❌ (AppVeyor log)
  * `37` branch: Python 3.7, numpy from conda-forge channel ❌ (AppVeyor log)
  * `defaultchannel` branch: Python 3.8, numpy from default channel ❌ (AppVeyor log) → Problem isn't just with the conda-forge numpy package
  * `systemtox` branch: Python 3.8, numpy from conda-forge channel, use system-tox instead of installing tox into conda ❌ (AppVeyor log) → Problem isn't with the tox installed via `conda install tox`)
  * `36` branch: Python 3.6, numpy from conda-forge channe ✅ (AppVeyor log)
  * `notox` branch: Python 3.8, numpy from conda-forge channel, install into system-conda(no tox) ✅ (AppVeyor log)
It's not clear whether `numpy` or `tox-conda` or a weird interaction between
the two is responsible for the problem.
