**Affected Symfony Version(s):** 4.1.8

**Description:**
When running a Symfony application, the PHP development server crashes without generating any error logs. The server log provides the following information:

```
[OK] Server listening on http://127.0.0.1:8000
// Quit the server with CONTROL-C.
PHP 7.2.12 Development Server started at Wed Nov 28 15:20:14 2018

Press Ctrl-C to quit.
[ERROR] The process has been signaled with signal "11".
```

**Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Create a new Symfony project using the following command:
   ```bash
   composer create-project symfony/website-skeleton symfony-test
   ```
2. Navigate to the newly created project directory:
   ```bash
   cd symfony-test
   ```
3. Start the PHP development server:
   ```bash
   php bin/console server:run
   ```
4. Open the website in your browser by navigating to `http://localhost:8000`.

The server will crash, and you should see the error message indicating that the process was terminated with signal "11".
