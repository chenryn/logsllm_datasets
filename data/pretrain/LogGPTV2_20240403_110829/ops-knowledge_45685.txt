Certainly! Here's a more polished and professional version of your text:

I need to establish a connection from a Windows Server 2008 in a secure network to an Ubuntu server, allowing me to read and write files easily from Python code. I prefer to avoid using Samba or FTP, so I am considering NFS (Network File System). My primary question is whether pynfs works stably on Windows, or if it is only compatible with Linux.

I found the source code and some forks on GitHub, but I am unsure about the current state and future of the project. It is not available on PyPI and cannot be installed via pip, which raises concerns about its maintenance and updates. I would greatly appreciate hearing from anyone who has production experience with pynfs. I am currently using Python 2.7.

Assistant: pynfs is actually a test suite and is not intended for use as an NFS server in a production environment.
