User: I need to connect from a windows server 2008 in a secure network to an ubuntu box and write and read files easily from python code. I want to avoid samba or ftp, so I am considering NFS and my question is, if pynfs works stable on windows (if at all, or does it work on linux only?)
I found the source and some forks on github
I am also unsure about the state of the project, it is not in pypi, it cannot be installed over pip, so I wonder if this is a maintaned and updated project with a future. It would be great to hear from someone who has some production experience with it, I am using python 2.7
Assistant: pynfs  is a test suite and not ment to run as nfs server in production
