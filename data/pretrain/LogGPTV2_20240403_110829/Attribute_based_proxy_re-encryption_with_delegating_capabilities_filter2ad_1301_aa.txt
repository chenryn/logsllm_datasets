Abstract. Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Proxy Re-Encryption (CP-ABPRE) extends the traditional
Proxy Re-Encryption (PRE) by allowing a semi-trusted proxy to transform a ciphertext under an access
policy to the one with the same plaintext under another access policy (i.e.attribute-based re-encryption).
The proxy, however, learns nothing about the underlying plaintext. CP-ABPRE has many real world ap-
plications, such as ﬁne-grained access control in cloud storage systems and medical records sharing among
diﬀerent hospitals. Previous CP-ABPRE schemes leave how to be secure against chosen-ciphertext attacks
(CCA) as an open problem. This paper, for the ﬁrst time, proposes a new CP-ABPRE to tackle the
problem. The new scheme supports attribute-based re-encryption with any monotonic access structures.
Despite our scheme is constructed in the random oracle model, it can be proved CCA secure under the
decisional q-parallel bilinear Diﬃe-Hellman exponent assumption.

Introduction
Introduced by Sahai and Waters [25], Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE), which is a generalization
of Identity-Based Encryption (IBE), is able to eﬀectively increase the ﬂexibility of data sharing such
that only parties satisfying speciﬁc policy are allowed to access the data. It comes in two ﬂavors: one is
the key-policy ABE (KP-ABE), and the other is the ciphertext-policy ABE (CP-ABE). In the former,
ciphertexts are labeled with attribute sets and private keys are associated with access structures that
specify which kinds of ciphertexts the receiver is able to decrypt. In the latter, however, the case is
complementary. That is, ciphertexts are related to access structures, and attribute sets are assigned to
private keys. ABE is applicable to many network applications, such as targeted broadcast and audit
log applications [15].
We use medical data sharing as an example to illustrate the usage of CP-ABE and motivate our
work as well. Consider the following scenario. A heart-disease patient Alice would like to ﬁnd a clinic
for regular medical examination via an on-line medical service agent (e.g., healthgrades4). The clinic
must be located within 10 km of Campbelltown, the doctors (assigned to her) of the clinic must be the
senior attending doctors and be expert at cardiology. For convenience, we denote Alice’s requirements
as I1 = {Cardiology ∧ Senior Attending Doctor ∧ Location : within 10 km of Campbelltown}.
To protect the conﬁdentiality of her medical record, Alice prefers to encrypt the record under I1 (i.e.
EncI1(mAlice)) before sending to the on-line medical service agent (“the Agent”). The Agent (that
knows I1) then searches candidates satisfying I1 in its database. Suppose there is a clinic matching I1.
The Agent forwards Alice’s ciphertext to the clinic. Note that the Agent cannot access the medical data
without knowledge of the private key (where such a key is associated with an attribute set satisfying
I1).

Upon receiving Alice’s ciphertext, the clinic that satisﬁes I1 is able to decrypt the ciphertext using
its private key so as to access the medical record. To keep trace of the medical record, the clinic may
back up the ciphertext locally. Suppose some cooperation is required in the process of the treatment,
Alice’s medical record has to be transferred to hospitals with the following requirements. The hospitals
have to be located within 15 km of Hurstville, and the doctors (assigned to the cooperation) of the
hospitals should be the attending or chief doctors and must be expert at cardiology as well. Denote
the above requirements as I2 = {Cardiology ∧ (Attending Doctor ∨ Chief Doctor) ∧ Location :
within 15 km of Hurstville}. Suppose there are two hospitals, say hospital A and hospital B, which
satisfy I2.
In traditional data sharing, sharing Alice’s medical record with A and B (without losing conﬁden-
tiality), the clinic has to ﬁrst recover mAlice and further encrypt the record under I2 (i.e. EncI2(mAlice))
before sending to A and B. However, if there are N patients who need to be cooperatively treated
among the clinic, A and B, then the clinic will suﬀer from N pairs of encryption and decryption for
their patients’ records (See Fig. 1). This might be undesirable in practice due to high computational
complexity.
Fig. 1. Traditional Attribute-Based Encryption Data Sharing
To make data sharing be more eﬃciently, Proxy Re-Encryption (PRE) is proposed. Introduced
by Mambo and Okamoto [23] and ﬁrst deﬁned by Blaze, Bleumer and Strauss [6], PRE extends the
traditional Public Key Encryption (PKE) to support the delegation of decryption rights. It allows a
semi-trusted party called proxy to transform a ciphertext intended for a party A into another ciphertext
of the same plaintext intended for party B. The proxy, however, learns neither the decryption keys nor
the underlying plaintext. PRE is a useful cryptographic primitive and has many applications, such as
secure distributed ﬁles systems [1,2] and email forwarding [6].
To date, PRE has been extended to adapt diﬀerent cryptographic settings. Employing PRE in
the context of ABE, Liang et al. [20] proposed the ﬁrst ciphertext-policy attribute-based proxy re-
encryption (CP-ABPRE) scheme, in which a proxy is allowed to transform a ciphertext under a
speciﬁed access policy into the one under another access policy (i.e. attribute-based re-encryption).
Using CP-ABPRE the medical records sharing above can be eﬃciently fulﬁlled as follows (See Fig.
2). The clinic, acting as a delegator, notiﬁes a cloud (storage) server (acting as the proxy) that the
hospitals satisfying I2 (i.e., delegatees), should be granted the decryption rights of the medical records.
The server will then transform the ciphertexts of the medical records under I1 to the ones under I2
using a re-encryption key (e.g., rkI1→I2 which is generated by the clinic), such that A and B (the
hospitals satisfying I2) can decrypt the records. Note that the server does not learn the contents (of
the medical records).

Fig. 2. Ciphertext-policy attribute-based proxy re-encryption
We argue that CP-ABPRE explores the applications of PRE and has many real world applica-
tions, such as ﬁne-grained data sharing in on-line medical service systems (such as Healthgrades5,
Scripps Health6). For example, in an on-line medical service system, a couple (who settles down in
Sydney) prefers to ﬁnd doctors with the following requirements to remedy their child’s bronchitis. De-
note the requirements as I3 = {P aediatrician ∧ Bronchitis ∧ (Consultant ∨ Registrar) ∧ Location :
Downtown of Sydney}. The parent encrypts the child’s medical record under I3 before uploading
to the system. Because the system has no corresponding private key related to I3, it cannot access
7. Nevertheless, when
the record. The system then forwards the ciphertext to the doctors satisfying I3
one of the doctors goes out for medical trip or for vacation, it is necessary to ﬁnd some trustworthy
substitutes whom can check the medical record. By employing CP-ABPRE a doctor can ﬁrst specify a
new access policy, such as I4 = {P aediatrician ∧ Bronchitis ∧ (Senior Registrar ∨ Registrar)}, and
then generates a re-encryption key (which can transform the ciphertext under I3 into the one under
I4) for his/her proxy. When the doctor is absent, the proxy can translate the ciphertext of the record
to the one which can be only decrypted by the doctors satisfying I4.
Previous CP-ABPRE schemes are only secure against chosen-plaintext attacks (CPA). The exis-
tence of CP-ABPRE with chosen-ciphertext security has been open. We note that CPA security might
be not suﬃcient in general protocol settings as it only achieves the very basic requirement from an
encryption scheme, i.e. secrecy against “passive” eavesdroppers. When CP-ABPRE is implemented
within a large protocol or system, a much wider array of attacks are possible. For example, the adver-
sary may have control over the ciphertexts so as to aﬀect the decryption values or learn some partial
information of decryption result.
CCA security, however, allows the adversary to access the decryption oracle, i.e. achieving the
ability to read the underlying plaintext related to the ciphertexts of its choice. This is able to pre-
clude insider attacks. For example, a legitimate doctor of some hospital is able to acquire pairs of
CP-ABPRE ciphertexts and plaintexts as previous knowledge. But the CCA security guarantees that
he/she still cannot gain any useful knowledge of the underlying plaintext of the challenge ciphertext
after his/her retirement. CCA security also implies non-malleability that guarantees that if the ad-
versary modiﬁes given ciphertexts, then the corresponding decryption yields invalid results. That is,
even if the ciphertexts are modiﬁed and re-transferred to other hospitals (whom are not the recipients
speciﬁed by original sender), the underlying medical records still cannot be accessed. Therefore, it is
desirable to propose CCA secure CP-ABPRE scheme in practice.

Another open problem left by previous CP-ABPRE schemes is how to support any monotonic
access policy. In practical use, it is desirable to enable a CP-ABPRE to support expressive and ﬂexible
realization for access policy. This paper also deals with this problem.
1.1 Our Contributions
In this work we formalize the deﬁnition for CP-ABPRE. Speciﬁcally, in our deﬁnition an attribute set
and an access structure is required as auxiliary input to the re-encryption key algorithm; meanwhile,
an attribute set is required in the input to the private key generation and decryption algorithms.
Regarding to the security models, we propose the selective access structure and chosen ciphertext
security (IND-sAS-CCA) game for CP-ABPRE. Note that it is the ﬁrst time to deﬁne chosen ciphertext
security model for CP-ABPRE in the literature; and meanwhile, the game above can be easily converted
to the adaptive access structure and chosen ciphertext security (IND-aAS-CCA) one (details can be
seen in Section 2.2). We consider the IND-sAS-CCA game into two diﬀerent aspects: one is to allow
the adversary to achieve an original ciphertext as the challenge ciphertext; the other is to allow the
adversary to achieve a re-encrypted ciphertext as challenge. We refer to the security of the former and
the latter as IND-sAS-CCA security at original ciphertext (i.e. IND-sAS-CCA-Or) and IND-sAS-CCA
security at re-encrypted ciphertext (i.e. IND-sAS-CCA-Re), respectively. In this paper we also show
that the IND-sAS-CCA-Or security implies selective collusion resistance. Note that in [22] selective
collusion resistance is also called as selective master key security.
The construction of a CP-ABPRE with CCA security is an open problem left by previous CP-
ABPRE schemes. This paper proposes the ﬁrst single-hop unidirectional CP-ABPRE to tackle the
problem. It is also worth mentioning that the existing CP-ABPRE schemes only support AND gates
on (multi-valued) positive and negative attributes, while our scheme allows ciphertexts to be associated
with any monotonic access formula. Despite our scheme is constructed in the random oracle model, it
can be proved IND-sAS-CCA secure under the decisional q-parallel bilinear Diﬃe-Hellman exponent
(q-parallel BDHE) assumption.
Diﬃculty of Converting Previous CPA Secure CP-ABPRE to Be Secure against CCA.
As stated in [20], to convert a CPA secure CP-ABPRE scheme to be CCA one is a challenging open
problem. One might think that some cryptographic primitives might come to help, such as the CHK
transformation [7]. The well-known CHK transformation can be used to convert a CPA secure PKE
scheme to be secure against CCA. The transformation, however, cannot be trivially employed in a
CPA secure PRE scheme so as to achieve CCA security. This is so because the CHK transformation
is used to prevent ciphertext from being mutated, but at the same time, PRE allows a ciphertext
to be transformed into another ciphertext. Namely, we use CHK transformation to guarantee the
validity of ciphertexts leads to a fact that the modiﬁcation part brought by re-encryption cannot be
virtually protected. Thus, trivially employ the CHK transformation in the PRE setting often results
in a Replayable CCA security (RCCA) [9]. The classic instances are [21,11,13].
We here use an example to make a speciﬁc explanation. Suppose there is a CPA secure CP-ABPRE
scheme which is constructed in the standard model, and its original ciphertext is (A, B, C). In re-
encryption, suppose the proxy at least generates (at least) a new component A(cid:48), and outputs (A(cid:48), B, C)
as the re-encrypted ciphertext such that the corresponding delegatee can recover the plaintext from
(A(cid:48), B, C) by using his private key. Using the CHK transformation, the delegator may make a signature
D for (A, B, C) and output (Kv, A, B, C, D) as the original ciphertext, where Kv is the veriﬁcation
key corresponding to D. To validate the signature, the proxy has to keep A as an auxiliary output,
i.e. outputting (Kv, A, A(cid:48), B, C, D). Despite the integrity of (A, B, C) can be veriﬁed by Kv and D,
A(cid:48) can be arbitrarily mutated by adversary. On the other hand, if only B and C are bound by D,
then A’s integrity cannot be guaranteed. Note that to validate the CHK transformation one keynote
should be noticed that the veriﬁcation key Kv must be “sealed” in ciphertext components such that

s, and outputs (Kv, A, B, C, D, K(cid:48)
an adversary cannot simply choose a new signing and veriﬁcation key pair (K(cid:48)
a new signature D(cid:48) for (A, B, C).
s) and further make
One might doubt that the proxy might choose to sign A(cid:48) such that the re-encrypted ciphertext
is bound by signature. Nevertheless, this approach seems to be insensible. Suppose the proxy makes
v, A(cid:48), D(cid:48)) as the re-
a signature D(cid:48) for A(cid:48) using a new signing key K(cid:48)
v is the veriﬁcation key associated with D(cid:48). An adversary may launch
encrypted ciphertext, where K(cid:48)
the following attacks: it ﬁrst mutates A(cid:48) as A(cid:48)(cid:48), next chooses (K(cid:48)(cid:48)
v ), and then signs A(cid:48)(cid:48) in D(cid:48)(cid:48).
The adversary ﬁnally outputs (Kv, A, B, C, D, K(cid:48)(cid:48)
v , A(cid:48)(cid:48), D(cid:48)(cid:48)). Here the veriﬁcation is passed but the
ciphertext is mutated. The reason behind the attacks is that A(cid:48) as a single component is loosely
related to the original ciphertext and K(cid:48)
v.
A naive solution for the problem is to request the proxy to not only encrypt A(cid:48) under a new access
policy which associates with the delegatees’ attributes, but also make signature for the new ciphertext
as the manner of original ciphertext. However, this approach comes at a price that the communication
bandwidth and decryption complexity are both increased. Furthermore, the proxy might suﬀer from
malicious attacks or invasion by adversary. Thus, this solution might be easily experienced the same
attacks introduced in the previous paragraph. In some privacy-preserving CP-ABPRE setting, i.e. the
proxy does not know the corresponding delegatees’ attributes, this solution is inappropriate as well.
Therefore, using the CHK transformation as a black box to turn the existing CPA secure CP-
ABPRE schemes to be secure against CCA that is not trivial. In section 4, we show an eﬃcient
solution to address the diﬃculty.
1.2 Related Work
In 2005 Sahai and Waters [25] introduced the concept of ABE. There are two categories of ABE, KP-
ABE and CP-ABE. Goyal et al. [15] proposed the ﬁrst KP-ABE, in which a ciphertext is related to a set
of attributes, and each private key corresponds to an access policy over the attributes. The decryption
can be fulﬁlled correctly if and only if the attribute set of the ciphertext satisﬁes the access policy on
the decryptor’s private key. Reversely, Bethencourt et al. [5] proposed CP-ABE where the ciphertext
is associated with an access policy and the private key is related to an attribute set. Note that we here
mainly focus on reviewing CP-ABE. Later on, Cheung and Newport [10] proposed a provably secure
CP-ABE scheme which only supports AND gates over attributes. The ﬁrst fully expressive CP-ABE
was proposed by Waters [26]. Using dual system encryption, Lewko et al. [18] proposed a fully secure
CP-ABE which leads to some loss of eﬃciency compared to the most eﬃcient scheme proposed in [26].
Recently, Attrapadung et al. [3] proposed a CP-ABE with constant-size ciphertexts.
Following the introduction of decryption rights delegation by Mambo and Okamoto [23], Blaze et
al. [6] formalized proxy re-encryption and proposed a seminal bidirectional PRE scheme. After that,
Ivan and Dodis [17] formalized the deﬁnitions of bidirectional and unidirectional proxy functions. In
2005, Ateniese et al. [1,2] proposed three unidirectional PRE schemes with CPA security. Later on,
many classic PRE schemes (e.g., [8,16,21]) have been proposed.
To implement PRE in the attribute-based cryptographic setting, Liang et al. [20] deﬁned CP-
ABPRE, and proposed a concrete construction based on a CP-ABE scheme [10] in which access policy
is only represented as AND gates on positive and negative attributes. Mizuno and Doi [24] proposed
a hybrid PRE scheme (in general) where the scheme can bridge ABE and IBE in the sense that
ciphertexts generated in the context of ABE can be converted to the ones which can be decrypted in
the IBE setting. Luo et al. [22] proposed a CP-ABPRE scheme which supports AND gates on multi-
valued and negative attributes. The aforementioned CP-ABPRE schemes, however, are only secure
against CPA and supports AND gates over attributes. The construction of a CCA secure CP-ABPRE
supporting any monotonic access policy remains open. This paper deals with this problem.
We here compare our scheme with previous CP-ABPRE schemes, and summarize the comparison in
terms of public/private key size, ciphertext/re-encryption key size, re-encryption cost and properties,
6
in Table 1. We let f be the size of an access formula, A be the number of attributes on a user’s private
key, U be the number of all attributes deﬁned in the system, mv be multi-valued attribute, + be
positive attribute and − be negative attribute. Besides, we use ce and cp to denote the computational
cost of an exponetiation and a bilinear pairing. To the best of our knowledge, our scheme is the ﬁrst
of its kind to achieve CCA security and to support any monotonic access formula (over attributes).
