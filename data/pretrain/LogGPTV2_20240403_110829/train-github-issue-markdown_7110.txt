## 🐛 Bug
## To Reproduce
I have created a Python package with PyTorch and torchvision as dependencies:
requirements.txt
    # Image Preprocessing
    pims_nd2>=1.0,=3.2.3,=1.6.0,=0.17.2,=1.18.5,=1.6.0,=0.7.0,=5.11.3,<5.13.0
    # Utils
    tqdm
setup.py
    # Always prefer setuptools over distutils
    from setuptools import setup, find_packages
    # To use a consistent encoding
    from codecs import open
    # Get the long description from the README file
    with open('README.md', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        long_description = f.read()
    def parse_requirements(filename):
        """ load requirements from a pip requirements file """
        lineiter = (line.strip() for line in open(filename))
        return [line for line in lineiter if line and not line.startswith("#")]
    install_reqs = parse_requirements("requirements.txt")
    # Arguments marked as "Required" below must be included for upload to PyPI.
    # Fields marked as "Optional" may be commented out.
    setup(
     ********************************
        install_requires=install_reqs,  # Optional
        include_package_data=True,
        data_files=[
            ("","requirements.txt")
        ]
    )
The problem is that when I install my package on Windows no PyTorch and
torchvision gets downloaded. In Linux it works perfectly.
## Expected behavior
It should work as in Linux done
