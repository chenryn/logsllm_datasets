Panel Theme 
This  panel  presents  a  selection  of  the  best,  most 
interesting,  and  most  provocative  work  from  the  New 
Security Paradigms Workshop 2004. For thirteen years, the 
New Security Paradigms Workshop (NSPW) has provided 
a  productive  and  highly  interactive  forum  for  innovative 
new approaches to computer security.  
in  order 
NSPW  is  an  invitational  workshop  of  deliberately 
small  size, 
to  facilitate  deep,  meaningful 
discussions  of  new  ideas.  Authors  are  encouraged  to 
present  work  that  might  seem  risky  in  other  settings.  All 
participants  are  charged  with  providing  constructive 
feedback.  The  resulting  brainstorming  environment  has 
proven to be an excellent medium for the furthering of “far 
out” and visionary ideas.  
Our  philosophy  is  to  look  for  significantly  new
paradigms and shifts from previous thinking, and facilitate 
the  debate  within  a  constructive  environment  of 
experienced researchers and practitioners along with newer 
participants  in  the  field.  In  keeping  with  the  NSPW 
philosophy,  this  panel  challenges  many  of  the  dominant 
paradigms  in  information  security.  You  can  definitely 
expect  it  to  be  highly  interactive;  in  the  NSPW  tradition, 
look forward to lively exchanges between the panelists and 
the  audience.  So  come  prepared  with  an  open  mind  and 
ready  to  question  and  comment  on  what  our  panelists 
present! 
Past  NSPW  conference  panels  have  dealt  with  a  wide 
variety  of  subjects  including  the  following:  software 
engineering  of  secure  systems;  penetration  tolerance;  new 
directions  in  cryptography  and  steganography;  alternative 
models  of  trust  and  authorization;  user-centered  security 
for  securing 
and  end-user  defenses;  new  models 
"boundless 
traditional 
definitions  of  security,  secrecy,  and  integrity;  security  in 
PDA  devices;  attack  modeling;  offensive  information 
warfare;  the  effectiveness  of  biometrics;    mechanisms  to 
combat  email  spam;  and  a  framework  for  data  privacy

The  last  NSPW  panel  was  held  at  ACSAC  2003  and 
was  well  received,  very  lively  and  highly  praised  by  the 
audience, ACSAC organizers and panelists alike.  
Here  are  some  of  the  latest  ideas  to  emerge  from 
NSPW, aside from those you will hear from the rest of the 
panelists.  
•
The  idea  that  defensive  information  warfare  will 
always  fail,  and  that  offensive  information  warfare  is 
necessary.  
• Optimistic  security  as  an  access  control  paradigm, 
where  in  certain  situations  (e.g.,  hospitals)  users  are 
permitted to violate standard access control paradigms 
in the interests of safety.  
• An  examination  of  the  way  market  forces  may  drive 
the use of protection profiles in the Common Criteria.

enlarging their 
assumptions to include environment and context.  
• A  case  was  made that  we  must  reconsider  our 
approach to information security from the ground up if 
we  are  to  deal  effectively  with  the  problem  of 
information risk.  
• A discussion as to the nature and definition of the old 
security paradigms due to the view that it is necessary 
to  define  the  old  paradigms  before  the  novelty  of 
``new''  ones  can  be  considered  with  anything 
approaching scientific rigor.  
• A  new  system  integrity  model  that  is  implementation

• A new method of downgrading that uses decision trees 
to avoid the inference problem.  
• A  new  approach  to  helping  applications  defend 
themselves,  while  disarming  hosts  via  the  use  of 
filters.  
Since bugs are ubiquitous, a new paradigm called bug

Panel Format 
The  panel  will  consist  of  four  authors  of  papers 
selected by the NSPW 2004 General and Program Chairs, 
and  it  will  be  chaired  by  the  general  chair.  The  NSPW 
Panel at ACSAC has been well received in previous years, 
and based on feedback, we continue to work on improving 
its  format.  The  panel  will  be  organized  to  maximize 
audience participation:

The  chair  will  open 
introductory remarks. 
Each panelist will give a short presentation that is 
intended  to  get  across  the  key  ideas  behind  their 
work. 
• After  each  panelist  presentation,  there  will  be  a 
question  and  answer  session  with  the  audience. 
To ensure momentum in the discussion, the Panel 
Chair  will  also  have  prepared,  in  advance,  some

The  panel  presentations  and  discussions  are  intended  to 
capture  the  lively  interaction  and  debate  that  occurs 
between  audience  and  panel  members  during  an  NSPW 
presentation. Each proposed ACSAC panelist will be given 
just  five  minutes  of  uninterrupted  `formal’  presentation 
time.  The  formal  presentation  of  each  panelist 
is 
deliberately  short;  it  is  intended  to  ensure  that  their 
paradigm  thesis  will  be  immediately  accessible  to  the 
audience  and

audience.

So  come  to  our  panel  and  discover  this  year’s  new
paradigms! You’ll either immediately like  them or dislike 
them - and you’ll get the chance to say so!
