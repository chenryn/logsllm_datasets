User: What is the difference between Docker and a virtual machine? When should I use Docker?
Assistant: The main difference between Docker and virtual machines is resource utilization efficiency and deployment speed. A virtual machine is a complete operating system virtualization technology. It needs to start the entire operating system to run applications, so it will occupy more system resources and take a long time to start and destroy. Docker is a lightweight container technology that runs on the host's operating system and allows multiple containers to share the host's operating system kernel, so it can achieve higher resource utilization efficiency and faster startup and destruction. Also faster. Docker should be used in the following situations: 1. Need to deploy multiple similar applications, such as web applications or databases 2. Need to package the application and its dependencies into an independent portable container 3. Need to deploy and destroy quickly Applications 4. Need higher resource utilization efficiency, and do not want to bear the additional overhead brought by virtualization 5. Need to achieve rapid expansion and fault tolerance.
