I realize that permutation_importance is a better and less biased measure than
Impurity-based feature importance but it still has it uses. As illustrated
here  multi-collinearity can be an issue. Comparing permutation and impurity
based importances is a good way to understand multicollinear issues and your
true feature importance.
Can a method like in GradientBoostingRegressor be added? This method.
