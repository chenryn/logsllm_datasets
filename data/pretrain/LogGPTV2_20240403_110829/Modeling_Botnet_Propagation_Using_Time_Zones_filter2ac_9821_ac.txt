Canada, and Mexico; the European group is composed of
European countries; and the Asian group is composed of
China, South Korea, Japan and adjacent areas (e.g., Aus-
tralia). We note that antivirus companies similarly organize
Internet monitoring into major groups: Asia, Europe, North
America, and so on [Tre05, Ull05].
Figure 2 shows the number of SYN connections sent to
the sinkhole per minute by the botnets in each group. The
time shown in X-axis is the 00:00UTC time of the labeled
date. Since each bot sends out a similar number of SYN
connection requests to its botmaster per minute, the number
of infected hosts in each group is proportional to the number
of SYNs sent from each group. Therefore, the curves in
Figure 2 represent the number of online infected computers
as time goes on.
As shown in this (cid:2)gure, for the botnet we are studying,
the Asian group has about eight times more infected com-
puters than the North American group has (although this is
not true for other botnets). In addition, the number of on-
line infected hosts of the Asian group reaches its peak level
when this number of the North American group reaches its
lowest level since the time difference between these two
groups is around 12 hours.
In the following, we study the propagation of a worm
based on the diurnal model, Eqn.(5), and the above three
groups. For simplicity, we assume the worm uniformly
scans the Internet, thus (cid:12)ji = (cid:17)=(cid:10); 8i; j 2 K. We also
assume that all computers in these groups have the same re-
moval rate (cid:13). Since the number of infected hosts is propor-
tional to the number of SYN connections per minute, we
choose populations of N1 = 15; 000 for the North Amer-
ican group, N2 = 45; 000 for the European group, and
N3 = 110; 000 for the Asian group. Then we deploy Mat-
lab Simulink [Mat05] to derive the numerical solutions for
the diurnal model Eqn. (5).
We wrote a program to automatically derive the dynam-
ics (cid:11)(t) for each group (and also each country). The basic
steps for deriving (cid:11)(t) include:
1. First, observe all botnet traf(cid:2)c, and break down victim
membership by geographic region.
2. Second, process the data from a region to derive (cid:11)(t)
through the following steps:
(cid:15) Split a monitored dataset into segments for each
day. Suppose a monitored dataset spans over n
days. Split the dataset into n segments where
each segment corresponding to one day contain-
ing the data from 00:00:00UTC to 24:00:00UTC
in that day.

(cid:15) Normalize the data in each segment so that the
maximum value of the data in each segment is
one.
(cid:15) Average the data in all segments to derive a pri-

(cid:15) In order to remove the monitoring noise, (cid:2)nd a
polynomial to represent (cid:11)(t) by minimizing the
cumulative square error between the polynomial
and the primary (cid:11)(t) derived in the previous step;
(cid:15) Normalize the result so that the maximum value
of (cid:11)(t) is one.
The diurnal shaping function (cid:11)(t) is a periodical func-
tion, i.e., (cid:11)(0) = (cid:11)(T ) where T = 24 hours. Af-
ter the (cid:2)rst one or two days, many worms’ infected
population will drop continuously due to patching and
cleaning of infected computers. For this reason, the
(cid:11)(t) derived through the above procedures usually has
(cid:11)(0) > (cid:11)(24). If this is the case, we need another step
to adjust the derived (cid:11)(t) so that (cid:11)(0) = (cid:11)(24). Here
we use a heuristic algorithm such that the shape of the
(cid:11)(t) is not distorted much.
3. Third, place the (cid:11)(t) table and its corresponding vul-
nerability in a database, keyed by vulnerability.
We followed these steps to derive (cid:11)(t) for North Amer-
ica, Europe and Asia, as shown in Figure 3(a). Studying the
diurnal dynamics of North American group, the time with
the fewest computers online is around 11:00 UTC, which
is 6:00am in US eastern coast and 3:00am in US western
coast. Figure 3(b) shows the cumulative online vulnerable
population across all three groups before the worm begins
to spread.

Figure 4. Comparison of models with botnet

groups also shows that combining multiple hour-sized time
zones into groups did not make the diurnal patterns indis-
tinguishable from each other.
Having derived values for (cid:11)(t), we can test how well the
diurnal model in Eqn. (5) can capture a worm’s propaga-
tion behavior in the Internet. Figure 4 shows the number
of online bot computers in the European group observed by
our sinkhole compared with the analytical results from the
model Eqn. (5), and the existing SIR model Eqn. (3). At
some initial time labeled as time 0 in the (cid:2)gure, the bot be-
gan to spread. After a while, the bot was discovered and
entered our sinkhole, and our data collection begins. Fig-
ure 4 shows that, compared with the SIR model Eqn. (3),
the diurnal model Eqn. (5) is much better in capturing the
diurnal property of a worm’s propagation and the active in-
fective populations in the Internet.

3.6 Practical Uses of Diurnal Models
The diurnal model Eqn. (5) tells us when releasing a
worm will cause the most severe infection to a region or the
entire Internet. For worms that focus on particular regions,
the model also lets us predict future propagation, based on
time of release. The role that time zones play on propaga-
tion is intuitively obvious, but has not been expressed in any
previous model.
3.6.1 Forecasting with Pattern Tables
The derived (cid:11)i(t) is not limited to the botnet under ex-
amination, but instead re(cid:3)ects the type of vulnerability ex-
ploited by the botnet. That is, different botnets that both
exploit the same vulnerability in Windows 2000 SP2 will
likely have similar Ni(t) (and therefore (cid:11)(t)), assuming
there are no other region-speci(cid:2)c limiting factors. That is,
both worms will target the same Si(t), if there are no differ-
ences (e.g., language differences such as Korean versus En-
glish language email viruses) that would clearly favor one
time zone’s population over another.
Repeated sampling of botnets using DNS redirection
noted in Section 2 (and other techniques) will conceivably
yield an understanding of how vulnerabilities are distributed
in different zones. Since (cid:11)i(t) corresponds to the type of
vulnerability being exploited, repeatedly seeing malware
target the same OS (cid:3)aw may assist forecasting. Researchers
can infer the growth of future outbreaks based on previ-
ous attempts to exploit the same vulnerability. Thus, when
a new bot appears targeting a familiar vulnerability, re-
searchers can use timely previous examples to estimate how
far and fast the bot will spread.
Accordingly, we can build a table of the derived shaping
functions, based on observed botnet data, and key the table
based on other heuristics about the worm (e.g., the exploit
used, the OS/patch level it affects, country of origin). When
a new worm is discovered, these heuristics are often the (cid:2)rst
few pieces of information learned from a honeypot. One
can then consult the table for any prior (cid:11)i(t) derivations,
and use them to forecast the short-term population growth
of the bot, relative to its favored zone and time of release.
To evaluate the forecasting capability of our diurnal
model, we collected monitored traces of three botnets that
exploited the same vulnerability [Mic04]. The agents for
these botnets were released in succession, evidently as en-
hancements to prior versions. From our discussion in Sec-
tion 3, these botnets should have similar diurnal shaping
functions, (cid:11)i(t), for the same time zone or group of zones.
We therefore used the diurnal model derived from one bot-
net to predict the propagation dynamics of other botnets.
Fig. 5(a) shows the propagation dynamics of these three
botnets in the European group. Each data point represents
the number of SYN connection requests observed by our
sinkhole within every half an hour. Because these botnets
appeared in different time periods, their infected population
were different from each other since the vulnerable popula-
tion in the Internet varies over time. We therefore show the
results by normalizing their SYN connections. Figure 5(a)
clearly shows that botnets exploiting the same vulnerabil-
ity have similar diurnal dynamics. The results of the North
American and Asian groups, shown in Figs. 6(a), 7(a), were
also similar.
To evaluate the predictive capability of our diurnal
model, we derive the parameters for the diurnal model based
on curve (cid:2)tting of data from Botnet 1 for the European
group. Then we use the derived diurnal model to predict the
dynamics of the other two botnets for the same European
