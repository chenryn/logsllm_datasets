### Measures versus λ₀ for Story

The following sequence of exponents is used to conduct tests on our dataset, where we randomly select a small set of "test" passwords (20% of the dataset) and use the remaining data to compute the enumeration Π.

- \(2^8\)
- \(2^6\)
- \(2^4\)
- \(2^2\)
- \(2^0\)
- \(2^{-15}\), \(2^{-12}\), \(2^{-9}\), \(2^{-6}\), \(2^{-3}\)
- \(2^0\)
- \(2^3\)
- \(2^6\)
- \(2^9\), \(2^{12}\), \(2^{15}\)

#### Guessing Entropy and Metrics

- **GavgS**: Average number of guesses per test password.
- **GmedS**: Median number of guesses per test password.
- **GxS**: Number of guesses sufficient to guess x percent of the test passwords, where 0 < x ≤ 100.

For example, if 25% of the test passwords could be guessed in 6 or fewer guesses, then G25S = 6.

By computing these measures, we ensure that they are intrinsically conservative given our dataset. An attacker with 80% of our dataset would perform at least as well as our measures suggest.

### Empirical Results

To affirm our methodology of using GavgS, GmedS, and GxS as stable measures of password quality, we plot these metrics under various instances of Assumption 4.1, i.e., for various values of \(\hat{\lambda}\) and a range of values for \(\lambda_{\hat{\lambda}}\). Figures 3 and 4 show these measures for different values of \(\lambda_0\) for the Face and Story schemes, respectively.

- **Key Observation**: GavgS, GmedS, G25S, and G10S are very stable as a function of \(\lambda_0\), whereas guessing entropy varies more, particularly for the Face scheme.

This stability reiterates our reasons for adopting GavgS, GmedS, and GxS as our security measures, and mitigates concerns over the influence of specific \(\lambda_0\) choices. Even for \(\hat{\lambda} = 1\) (with some back-off to \(\hat{\lambda} = 0\) as prescribed by Equation 5), values of \(\lambda_0\) and \(\lambda_1\) do not significantly impact our measures.

- **Example**: For the Face scheme, GavgS and G25S vary between 1361 and 1574, while guessing entropy varies between 252 and 3191. Similarly, G25S varies between 24 and 72, compared to 27 and 1531 when using Equation 5 directly.

In the remainder of the paper, the reported values for GavgS, GmedS, and GxS reflect \(\lambda_0\) and \(\lambda_1\) values that simultaneously minimize these metrics.

### Insights into Password Selection

**Story Scheme:**
- **Maximum Possible Passwords**: 3024
- **Maximum Guessing Entropy**: 1513

**Face Scheme:**
- **Maximum Possible Passwords**: 6561
- **Maximum Guessing Entropy**: 3281

**Observations:**
- For Face, if the user is known to be a male, the worst 10% of passwords can be guessed in just one or two attempts.
- If the user is Asian and their gender is known, the worst 10% of passwords can be guessed within the first six tries.
- GavgS is always higher than GmedS, indicating that there are several good passwords chosen that significantly increase the average number of guesses needed but do not affect the median.

### Memorability Evaluation

**Figures 7 and 8: Memorability Comparison**

- **Figure 7**: Percentage of successful logins versus time since password establishment.
- **Figure 8**: Percentage of successful logins versus time since last login attempt.

**Trend**: While both schemes have strong memorability, Story passwords appear somewhat harder to remember than Face passwords. This is consistent with previous studies showing high memorability for the Face scheme.
