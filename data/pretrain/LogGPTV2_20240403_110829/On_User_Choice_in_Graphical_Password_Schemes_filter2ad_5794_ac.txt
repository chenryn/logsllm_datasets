and so we believe this to be a more robust use of
(5). We use this sequence to conduct tests with
our dataset in which we randomly select a small
set of “test” passwords from our dataset (20% of
the dataset), and use the remainder of the data to
compute the enumeration Π.
We then guess passwords in order of Π until each
test password is guessed. To account for the ﬁrst
issue identiﬁed above, namely the set of available
categories during password selection, we ﬁrst ﬁlter
from Π the passwords that would have been invalid
given the available categories when the test pass-
word was chosen, and obviously do not guess them.
By repeating this test with non-overlapping test sets
of passwords, we obtain a number of guesses per
test password. We use GavgS
to denote the average
to denote the me-
over all test passwords, and GmedS
dian over all test passwords. Finally, we use GxS
for 0 < x ≤ 100 to denote the number of guesses
suﬃcient to guess x percent of the test passwords.
For example, if 25% of the test passwords could be
guessed in 6 or fewer guesses, then G25S = 6.
We emphasize that by computing our measures in
this fashion, they are intrinsically conservative given
our dataset. That is, an attacker who was given 80%
of our dataset and challenged to guess the remain-
ing 20% would do at least as well as our measures
suggest.
4.3 Empirical results
To aﬃrm our methodology of using GavgS , GmedS
, and
GxS as mostly stable measures of password quality,
we ﬁrst plot these measures under various instances
of Assumption 4.1, i.e., for various values of ˆ(cid:1) and,
for each, a range of values for λˆ(cid:1). For example, in
the case of ˆ(cid:1) = 0, Figures 3 and 4 show measures
GavgS , GmedS
, G25S and G10S , as well as the guessing
entropy as computed in (6), for various values of
λ0. Figure 3 is for the Face scheme, and Figures 4
is for the Story scheme.
The key point to notice is that each of GavgS , GmedS
,
G25S and G10S is very stable as a function of λ0,
whereas guessing entropy varies more (particularly
for Face). We highlight this fact to reiterate our
, and GxS as our
reasons for adopting GavgS , GmedS
measures of security, and to set aside concerns over
whether particular choices of λ0 have heavily inﬂu-
enced our results. Indeed, even for ˆ(cid:1) = 1 (with some
degree of back-oﬀ to ˆ(cid:1) = 0 as prescribed by (5)), val-
ues of λ0 and λ1 do not greatly impact our measures.
For example, Figures 5 and 6 show GavgS
and G25S for
Face. While these surfaces may suggest more vari-
ation, we draw the reader’s attention to the small
range on the vertical axis in Figure 5; in fact, the
variation is between only 1361 and 1574. This is in
contrast to guessing entropy as computed with (6),
which varies between 252 and 3191 when λ0 and λ1
are varied (not shown). Similarly, while G25S varies
between 24 and 72 (Figure 6), the analogous compu-

varies between 27 and 1531.
the paper, the numbers we report for GavgS , GmedS

and GxS reﬂect values of λ0 and λ1 that simultane-
ously minimize these values to the extent possible.

and the Face scheme, respectively. Populations with
less than ten passwords are excluded from these ta-
bles. These numbers were computed under Assump-
tion 4.1 for ˆ(cid:1) = 0 in the case of Story and for ˆ(cid:1) = 1 in
the case of Face. λ0 and λ1 were tuned as indicated
in the table captions. These choices were dictated
by our goal of minimizing the various measures we
consider (GavgS , GmedS
, G25S and G10S ), though as al-
ready demonstrated, these values are generally not
particularly sensitive to choices of λ0 and λ1.
The numbers in these tables should be considered
in light of the number of available passwords. Story

has 9×8×7×6 = 3024 possible passwords, yielding
a maximum possible guessing entropy of 1513. Face,
on the other hand, has 94 = 6561 possible passwords
(for ﬁxed sets of available images), for a maximum
guessing entropy of 3281.
Our results show that for Face, if the user is known
to be a male, then the worst 10% of passwords can
be easily guessed on the ﬁrst or second attempt.
This observation is suﬃciently surprising as to war-
rant restatement: An online dictionary attack of
passwords will succeed in merely two guesses for
10% of male users. Similarly, if the user is Asian
and his/her gender is known, then the worst 10% of
passwords can be guessed within the ﬁrst six tries.
It is interesting to note that GavgS
is always higher
. This implies that for both schemes,
than GmedS
there are several good passwords chosen that sig-
niﬁcantly increase the average number of guesses
an attacker would need to perform, but do not af-
fect the median. The most dramatic example of
this is for white males using the Face scheme, where
GavgS = 1260 whereas GmedS = 81.
These results raise the question of what diﬀerent
populations tend to choose as their passwords. In-
sight into this for the Face scheme is shown in Ta-
bles 4 and 5, which characterize selections by gender
and race, respectively. As can be seen in Table 4,
both males and females chose females in Face signif-
icantly more often than males (over 68% for females
and over 75% for males), and when males chose fe-
males, they almost always chose models (roughly
80% of the time). These observations are also widely
supported by users’ remarks in the exit survey, e.g.:
“I chose the images of the ladies which
appealed the most.”
“I simply picked the best lookin girl on each
page.”
“In order to remember all the pictures for my
login (after forgetting my ‘password’ 4 times
in a row) I needed to pick pictures I could
EASILY remember - kind of the same pitfalls
when picking a lettered password. So I chose
all pictures of beautiful women. The other
option I would have chosen was handsome
men, but the women are much more pleasing
to look at :)”
“Best looking person among the choices.”
Moreover, there was also signiﬁcant correlation
among members of the same race. As shown in Ta-
ble 5, Asian females and white females chose from
within their race roughly 50% of the time; white
males chose whites over 60% of the time, and black
males chose blacks roughly 90% of the time (though
the reader should be warned that there were only
three black males in the study, thus this number re-
quires greater validation). Again, a number of exit
surveys conﬁrmed this correlation, e.g.:
“I picked her because she was female and
Asian and being female and Asian, I thought
I could remember that.”
“I started by deciding to choose faces of
people in my own race ... speciﬁcally, people
that looked at least a little like me. The
hope was that knowing this general piece of
information about all of the images in my
password would make the individual
faces
easier to remember.”
“... Plus he is African-American like me.”

Insight into what categories of images diﬀerent gen-

in Tables 6 and 7. The most signiﬁcant deviations
between males and females (Table 6) is that females
chose animals twice as often as males did, and males
chose women twice as often as females did. Less
pronounced diﬀerences are that males tended to se-
lect nature and sports images somewhat more than
females did, while females tended to select food im-

how signiﬁcant they are. Little emerges as deﬁnitive
trends by race in the Story scheme (Table 7), par-
ticularly considering that the Hispanic data reﬂects
only two users and so should be discounted.
5 Memorability evaluation
In this section we brieﬂy evaluate the memorabil-
ity of the schemes we considered. As described in
Section 2, there have been many usability studies
performed for various graphical password schemes,
including for variants of the Face scheme. As such,
our goal in this section is not to exhaustively eval-
uate memorability for Face, but rather to simply
benchmark the memorability of the Story scheme
against that of Face to provide a qualitative and
relative comparison between the two.
Figure 7 shows the percentage of successful logins
versus the amount of time since the password was
initially established, and Figure 8 shows the per-
centage of successful logins versus the time since
that user’s last login attempt. Each ﬁgure includes
one plot for Face and one plot for Story. A trend
that emerges is that while memorability of both
schemes is strong, Story passwords appear to be
somewhat harder to remember than Face. We do
not ﬁnd this to be surprising, since previous studies
have shown Face to have a high degree of memora-
bility.
