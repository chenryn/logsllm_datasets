User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题gitlab ssh access connection refused I'm trying to access gitlab with my account in SSH with public key authentication. I have uploaded my public key and here is my SSH configuration:

content of /home/$my_user/.ssh/config
Host gitlab
User git
Port 22
Hostname gitlab.$my_domain
IdentityFile /home/$my_user/.ssh/id_rsa
IdentitiesOnly yes


Here is the command I tiped:

mkdir $my_project
cd $my_project
git init
touch README
git add README
git commit -m 'first commit'
git remote add origin gitlab:$my_user/$my_project.git
git push -u origin master


Here is the sshd log file:
auth.log

Here is the stack on client side:
client stack

As I am authenticated, and my key correctly loaded from ~git/.ssh/authorized_keys, I presume the trouble comes from the client side. But I cannot determine where the issue comes from and neither how to fix it.

Many thanks for your help; Don't hesitate to ask for more details if you need to.

EDIT: here is the output of ssh -v git@gitlab

Assistant: The gitlab shell, which is invoked by your SSH login, needs to make a call to the API of the gitlab web application to determine if you're authorized to push. However, it can't connect to it. Run the appropriate rake task for your version of gitlab to check the configuration of all the gitlab components and fix any errors it finds.
