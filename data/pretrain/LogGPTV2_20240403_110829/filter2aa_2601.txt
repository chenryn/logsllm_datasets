## Introduction

- **Manager of Threat Systems at Fidelis Cybersecurity**
- **Part-Time Faculty at the University of Illinois in Computer Science (CS)**
- **Handler at the SANS Internet Storm Center**
- **Provider of open-source intelligence feeds, including DGAs (Domain Generation Algorithms)**
- **Runs several takedown-oriented groups and surveils threats**

---

## The Problem Illustrated (from VirusTotal)

- **The Reality:** A smaller set of actual malware tools, exploit kits (EKs), and criminal service providers.
- **Problem:** Most cybercrime impacts consumer networks that are often unprotected by security vendors or enterprise Security Operations Centers (SOCs).
- **Consumer Behavior:** Generally, consumers do not secure their devices, pay for security, or clean up malware infections, except in rare cases.

---

## Good News

- **Abundance of Open-Source Data:** There are numerous open-source data, blocklists, and tracking systems that publish near-real-time data on threats.
  - **My DGA Feeds**
  - **Malware Domains**
  - **Abuse.ch Trackers**
  - **PhishTank**
  - **Hundreds of others (primarily Western sources)**

---

## Requirements to Protect Consumers

- **Low False Positives:** Must have no or extremely low false positives, especially for compromised websites and shared hosting.
- **User Experience:** Must not impact the user experience.
- **Cost-Effective:** Must not increase costs.
- **Automation:** Must be automated for deployment and updates.
- **Security Awareness:** Ideally, include some method for informing infected users about their security status.

---

## Two Partial Solutions

- **DNS Requirement:** Almost all malware requires DNS at some point in the flow of traffic.
- **Solution Options:**
  - **RPZ (Response Policy Zones):** Essentially a DNS firewall.
  - **Auto-Generated Firewall Rules:**

---

## RPZ Primer

- **Functionality:** DNS Response Policy Zones (RPZ) act as a DNS firewall. On a resolver, you create zone files to protect constituents from malicious domains.
- **Behavior:** Instead of resolving to a bad site, users get a response defined by the RPZ configuration.

---

## RPZ Indicator Types

- **Detection Capabilities:**
  - **Hostnames and Domains**
  - **Resolved IP Addresses**
  - **Nameserver Hostnames**
  - **Nameserver IP Addresses**

---

## RPZ Actions

- **Possible Actions:**
  - **Return NXDOMAIN:** Indicate that the domain does not exist.
  - **Log the Query:** Allow the query but log it for analysis.
  - **Modify the Query:** Redirect the user to a "walled garden" (e.g., an IP address you define).
  - **Inform the User:** Use the walled garden to inform the user that they are infected and provide security awareness and cleanup instructions.

---

## RPZ Example

```dns
$TTL 60
@            IN    SOA  localhost. root.localhost.  (
                          282   ; serial  
                          3H  ; refresh  
                          1H  ; retry  
                          1W  ; expiry  
                          1H) ; minimum  
                  IN    NS    localhost.
oysjtyymfwbhfxv.com CNAME .
*.oysjtyymfwbhfxv.com CNAME .
ccvjoddsmsoheev.net CNAME .
*.ccvjoddsmsoheev.net CNAME .
paunsiqcihxtmgv.biz CNAME .
*.paunsiqcihxtmgv.biz CNAME .
```

## RPZ Resolved IP Address Example

```dns
# 5.8.37.0/24 (Listed in Spamhaus DROP List SBL284078)
24.0.37.8.5.rpz-ip CNAME .

# 36.93.0.0/16 (Listed in Spamhaus DROP List SBL310189)
16.0.0.93.36.rpz-ip CNAME .
```

---

## RPZ Nameserver Examples

```dns
# Block ns1.bambenekconsulting.com
ns1.bambenekconsulting.com.rpz-nsdname CNAME .

# Block nameservers at 8.8.8.0/24
24.8.8.8.8.rpz-nsip CNAME .
```

## Challenges with RPZ

- **Data Acquisition:** Setting up RPZ is straightforward, but obtaining reliable data is challenging.
- **Data Sources:**
  - **Dozens of hostname/domain lists**
  - **Hundreds of IP lists**
  - **Documentation and Confidence Levels:** Many lists lack documentation and confidence indicators.
  - **False Positives:** Concerns about false positives, compromised sites, and shared infrastructure.

---

## DGA Example

- **DGA (Domain Generation Algorithm):** Uses a complex mathematical algorithm to generate pseudo-random but predictable domain names.
- **Adversary Advantage:** Adversaries can dynamically generate hundreds or thousands of domains, requiring only a few to be registered at any time.

---

## DGA Difficulties

- **Word-List Based DGAs:**
  - **Examples:**
    - `windbearboxreceive.com` (used by matsnu DGA)
    - `winner-care-sir.com` (used by matsnu DGA)
    - `theirtheandaloneinto.com` (used by Rovnix DGA)
    - `thathistoryformertrial.com` (used by Rovnix DGA)
- **Adversary Control:** DNS for malicious domains is under the adversary's control until the domain is seized.

---

## Generating RPZ Files

- **Process:**
  - **For Each Source and Record Type:** Generate a zone using a for loop.
  - **Local Customization:** Allows local locations to choose their own confidence levels for each file.
  - **Policy Flexibility:** Different policies can be applied by zone (e.g., different landing pages for phishing vs. malware C2s).
  - **Global Whitelists:** Create global whitelists to prevent essential infrastructure from being blocked (e.g., root servers).

---

## DGA Feeds

- **Indicators:**
  - **Domain, IP, Nameservers, Nameserver IPs**
  - **Usage:**
    - **Domain Names:** Use unless word-list or shorter than 7 characters.
    - **IPs:** Do not use at this point.
    - **Nameserver Details:** Not used yet (no good way to automate).

---

## Malware Configurations

- **Configurable Items:**
  - **Every malware has different configurable items.**
  - **Intelligence Value:** Not all configuration items are valuable for intelligence purposes.
  - **Free-Form Text Fields:** Can provide useful data for correlation.
  - **Mutex:** Useful for correlating binaries to the same actor.
  - **Cobalt Strike:** Non-operational data is still useful for intelligence.

---

## Sample DarkComet Data

- **Key-Value Pairs:**
  - **CampaignID:** Guest16
  - **Domains:** 06059600929.ddns.net:1234
  - **Gencode:** 3yHVnheK6eDm
  - **Mutex:** DC_MUTEX-W45NCJ6
  - **OfflineKeylogger:** 1
  - **Version:** #KCMDDC51#

---

## Sample njRat Config

- **Key-Value Pairs:**
  - **Campaign ID:** 1111111111111111111
  - **Domain:** apolo47.ddns.net
  - **Install Dir:** UserProfile
  - **Install Name:** svchost.exe
  - **Port:** 1177
  - **Registry Value:** 5d5e3c1b562e3a75dc95740a35744ad0
  - **Version:** 0.6.4

---

## Bad Data

- **Adversary Tactics:**
  - **Malware Builders:** Adversaries know that configs are mined for feed generation.
  - **Poisoning Attempts:** Cases of "bad data" sent to VirusTotal and other platforms to poison automated feed generation.

---

## Scrubbing Malware Configs

- **Phase 1:**
  - **Eliminate RFC 1918 IP addresses**
  - **Use only dynamic DNS hostnames**
- **Phase 2 (Not Yet Operational):**
  - **Syn() Check:** For non-RFC 1918 IP addresses and domain names, perform a syn() check on ports to verify if they are up.
  - **Skip Common Ports:** If something is listening, it is considered "bad enough."

---

## What is an Exploit Kit?

- **Definition:** A set of web-based tools that exploit software vulnerabilities (browser, Adobe, Java, etc.) to spread malware.
- **Characteristics:**
  - **Static List of Exploits:** Varies between kits.
  - **Rarely Uses 0-Days:** Primarily uses known vulnerabilities.
  - **Criminal Service:** Operates as a service, selling infections of provided malware.
  - **Primary Defense:** Patch your OS and applications.

---

## Using a Crawler

- **Efficiency:** Inefficient due to requesting more than necessary.
- **Resource Intensive:** Broader searches require more resources.
- **Global Footprint:** Can be thorough and have a global reach.

---

## Bing Malicious URLs

- **Microsoft MAPP/VIA Program:**
  - **Daily Malicious Webpages:** Approximately 26 million daily, with a 99% confidence interval.
  - **Example URLs:**
    - `http://0000-programasnet.blogspot.com.ar/...`
    - `http://0000-programasnet.blogspot.com.es/...`

---

## Populating Data from Exploit Kits

- **Hierarchical Structure:** EKs have a hierarchical structure, and deeper levels need to be aware of landing pages to prevent direct access to the source.
- **Vulnerabilities:** Some systems have vulnerabilities that can provide information about the overall EK infrastructure, including landing pages and traffic delivery systems.

---

## Protecting Consumers from Ransomware

- **Abuse.ch Ransomware Tracker:**
  - **URL:** https://ransomwaretracker.abuse.ch/
  - **Downloads:** Domain blacklists, IP blacklists, and URL blacklists.
  - **False Positives:** Well-documented, with some risk.
  - **Protection:** Can even protect against tor2web-based C2s.

---

## Bottom Line

- **Open-Source Feeds:**
  - **Management:** I run a couple and am familiar with a few more.
  - **Visibility:** No global visibility; what is not impactful in Western networks could be very impactful elsewhere.
  - **Assessment:** Reliance on online data and assessing confidence.
  - **NXDOMAIN Alternative:** Use CNAME rpz-passthru for logging and assessing false positives.

---

## Quad9s

- **Open Resolver:**
  - **Setup:** Global locations, free to use.
  - **Ideal for Consumers:** Simple to use, but lacks telemetry and targeted security awareness.

---

## How to Deliver This?

- **RPZ Server:**
  - **URL:** rpz.bambenekconsulting.com
  - **Zone Transfers:** Can deliver "master" zone files or hundreds of zone files for customization.
  - **Control:** You decide your own policy and confidence levels.
  - **Framework:** An RPZ zone file generator framework is in development.

---

## Future Work

- **Blocking Criminal Networks:**
  - **ASN-Based Blocking:** Block entire IP spaces of bulletproof and other criminal networks.
  - **Automated Malicious Nameservers:** Find a way to identify and block malicious nameservers.
  - **Adoption:** Encourage every consumer-facing service provider to adopt similar methodologies.
