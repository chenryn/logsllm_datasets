#### Introduction
The structure and components of a suitable empirical study should be used to support the design, improvement, and redesign of processes to reduce their complexity. The Control-Flow Complexity (CFC) metric can be used to analyze the complexity of business processes, workflows, and other processes.

#### Conducting an Experiment
To perform an experiment, several steps must be taken in a specific order. An experiment can be divided into the following main activities (Perry et al., 2000):
1. **Research Context**: Explaining the terminology, defining the problem, and providing a brief research review.
2. **Hypotheses Formulation**: Stating the research questions clearly and formally.
3. **Experimental Design**: Planning the data collection and experimental procedures.
4. **Threats to Validity**: Identifying and mitigating factors that may affect the interpretation of results.
5. **Data Analysis and Presentation**: Analyzing the collected data and presenting the results.
6. **Results and Conclusions**: Drawing conclusions based on the analysis.

In the remainder of this section, we will explain how each of these activities was performed in our study.

#### Hypotheses Formulation
An essential aspect of experiments is to clearly state what we intend to evaluate. Our hypotheses are as follows:

- **Abstract Hypothesis**: "The CFC metric is a good and accurate measure to evaluate and establish the control-flow complexity of processes."
- **Concrete Hypothesis**: "There is a significant correlation between the CFC metric and the subjects' rating of the control-flow complexity of processes."

#### Research Context
**Terminology and Problem Definition:**
- **Process Complexity**: The degree to which a business process is difficult to analyze, understand, or explain.
- **Control-Flow Complexity**: The degree of complexity of a process from a control-flow perspective.

The CFC metric can be used to automatically measure the control-flow complexity of a process based on its structure. This allows designers to create less complex processes, reducing the time spent reading and understanding them to remove faults or adapt to changed requirements.

**Our Goal:**
To analyze the CFC metric for evaluating and validating the proposed metric. We aim to determine the correlation between the output of the CFC metric and the perceived control-flow complexity from the point of view of process designers.

**Subjects Selection:**
Our subjects were Master's students from the Department of Mathematics and Engineering at the University of Madeira, Portugal. These students had recently completed a 50-hour course in Business Process Management (BPM) and had at least medium experience in designing and analyzing business processes.

**Research Review:**
In Cardoso (2005d), we presented the CFC metric to analyze the degree of complexity of business processes. With the emergence of processes spanning both within and between enterprises (Sheth, van der Aalst, & Arpinar, 1999), complexity analysis has become increasingly important.

#### Study Design
**Experiment Design:**
- **Objects to be Rated**: Business processes graphically designed using the METEOR workflow management system (Kochut, 1999).
- **Independent Variable**: Measured using the CFC metric.
- **Dependent Variable**: Measured according to the subjects' ratings.
- **Material Preparation**: 22 professionally designed, error-free processes related to bank loan applications.

Each subject carried out the experiment alone in class with unlimited time. Data collected included subjects' ratings and measurements calculated by the CFC metric.

#### Threats to Validity
**Construct Validity:**
- All measurements of the dependent variable were subjective and based on the subjects' perceptions. Given the subjects' medium experience in BPM design, their ratings are considered significant.
- The independent variable, measuring control-flow complexity, is constructively valid from a complexity theory perspective.

**Internal Validity:**
- Considered aspects that could threaten internal validity, such as differences among subjects, precision of ratings, learning effects, fatigue, and subject incentives.
- Subjects were knowledgeable about the evaluation issues, and the results showed a correlation between the independent and dependent variables.

**External Validity:**
- Threat identified: Subject selection. To generalize the results, it is necessary to replicate the experiment with a more diverse group of subjects, including practitioners and designers with varying levels of experience.

#### Data Analysis and Presentation
**Approach:**
- **Quantitative Analysis**: Subjects rated processes on a numerical scale from 0 to 100.
- **Qualitative Analysis**: Performed in conjunction with statistical analysis.

**Spearman Rank-Difference Correlation Coefficient (r_S):**
- Used to determine the correlation between subjects' ratings and the CFC metric.
- Null Hypothesis (H_0): "There is no correlation between the CFC metric and the subjects' rating of control-flow complexity."

**Decision Rules:**
- For α = 0.005: Reject H_0 if r_S >= 0.586.
- For α = 0.05: Reject H_0 if r_S >= 0.425.

**Results:**
- For 84% of the subjects, r_S values were greater than 0.586, leading to the rejection of the null hypothesis.
- For all subjects, r_S values were greater than 0.425, also leading to the rejection of the null hypothesis.

**Conclusion:**
- There is a high correlation between the CFC metric and the subjects' rating of control-flow complexity.
- The CFC metric effectively measures the control-flow complexity of processes, supporting its intended purpose.

#### Related Work
While significant research on software complexity exists, work on business process complexity is limited. Key contributions include:
- **Software Metrics**: Halstead’s measure (Halstead, 1977), McCabe’s measure (McCabe, 1977), COCOMO model (Boehm, 1981), and Function-Point method (Garmus & Herron, 2000).
- **Business Process Metrics**: Reijers and Vanderfeesten (2004) propose a cohesion and coupling metric for workflows, which can be reformulated for a complexity perspective.

#### Conclusion
Our work presents an approach to conduct business process complexity analysis. The CFC metric is a design-time measurement that can be used to evaluate the difficulty of producing a process design before implementation. Integrating control-flow complexity analysis into the process development cycle can lead to optimized processes and cost-effective defect resolution. We have defined the terminology and objectives of the CFC measure and evaluated it in terms of Weyuker’s properties, demonstrating its effectiveness and comprehensiveness.
