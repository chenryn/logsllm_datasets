User: I am having some trouble with opening a .py file. I have a program that calls this .py file (i.e. pathname/example.py file.txt), but instead of running the python program, it opens it in Notepad. How to I get it to run?
The program itself takes in a file, and creates an output that is more readable.
Edit: The operating system is Windows 7. And the file that is calling the python is a .bat file.
Edit 2: It looks like I had to reinstall python for some reason... but it looks like it is finally working. Why reinstalling never comes to mind in the first place... And then I had to change how the file extention was opened. Thanks guys
Assistant: This happened because most probably you have set notepad as the default program to open a .py file. Go to default programs app in windows. Select choose app by extension. Here search for .py files. Change the option from notepad to python. This should solve your problem.
