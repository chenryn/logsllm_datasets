User: I get this error message when running install.bat (or install.sh through 'bash' shell) of google-cloud-sdk.
Python is version 3.6.
Any suggestions?
Assistant: Ensure two things:

While installing the GoogleCloudSDK, check the 'BundledPython' option. It will install both python and python3.
Make sure your environment variable-PYTHONPATH is pointing to the directory having the python.exe file.

This worked out for me.
