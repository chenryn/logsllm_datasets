When running `install.bat` (or `install.sh` through the `bash` shell) for the Google Cloud SDK, I encountered an error. My Python version is 3.6. Do you have any suggestions?

**Suggestions:**

1. **Bundled Python Installation:**
   - During the installation of the Google Cloud SDK, ensure that you select the 'BundledPython' option. This will install both Python 2 and Python 3, which can help resolve compatibility issues.

2. **Environment Variable Configuration:**
   - Verify that your `PYTHONPATH` environment variable is correctly set to the directory containing the `python.exe` file. This ensures that the correct Python interpreter is being used by the SDK.

These steps resolved the issue for me.
