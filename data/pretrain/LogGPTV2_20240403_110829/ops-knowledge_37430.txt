User: I had developed an app in python on mac osx for opening different file types on double-clicking any file. Then I converted into app by using py2app. py2app creates a myapp.app within dist folder. I moved myapp.app from dist folder to Applications location. Now, I am able to open any file through myapp just by double-clicking on it. Now, I want to make it work in such a way that, I don't need to drag and drop myapp to Applications location,it should automatically install on system.
Assistant: You can use packagemaker. It makes myapp.pkg file that when double-clicked installa an app in Applications location.
