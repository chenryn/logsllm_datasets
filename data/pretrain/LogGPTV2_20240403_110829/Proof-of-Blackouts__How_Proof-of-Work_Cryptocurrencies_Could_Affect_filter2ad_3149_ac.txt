hash rate is caused by current hardware and that the hardware contributes
hashes to the network for a ﬁxed time period of six months (Bitcoin) or 12
months (Ethereum). Instead of including power eﬃciency of individual miners
into our calculation, we take the values from the regression analysis of step
3.
8 The only arguable parameter is the hardware’s total runtime. Therefore, we followed
a twofold approach to test its plausibility: On the one hand, we collected typical
runtimes in the community conﬁrming our assumption. On the other hand, we argue
that the range of plausible values does not change the result signiﬁcantly.

6. Finally, we infer the cryptocurrency’s total power consumption for the hard-
ware mix from step 5. We multiply the hash rates with the assigned power
eﬃciency for every entry within the hardware mix.
The gained results, as well as speciﬁcs, for Bitcoin and Ethereum are pre-
sented in the remainder of this section.
Fig. 2. Results for the Bitcoin network.
Total Power Consumption of Bitcoin: Collecting data for Bitcoin miners
was based on a hardware list from the Bitcoin Wiki9, we cross-checked the pro-
vided parameters for hash rate and power consumption and added release dates.
However, we faced various diﬃculties: (a) Due to bankruptcies, companies pro-
ducing hardware disappeared from the market and data sheets of their hardware
is not available anymore (if ever present). In such cases, we relied on technical
reviews on the respective hardware and blogs or forum posts of the active Bit-
coin community. (b) Delivery dates were not met in multiple cases; shipment was
delayed by multiple months and eventually the miners went online later than
initially announced. Therefore, we veriﬁed the initial announcements from the
hardware vendors with community posts. In case of delays, we included the actual
shipping date into our calculation. (c) Some products have never been shipped at
all, or we did not ﬁnd any speciﬁcation indicating their hash rate and/or power
consumption. For these reasons, we excluded twelve miners from the original
list containing 83 miners. As commodity hardware and ﬁeld-programmable gate
arrays (FPGAs) have become outdated for multiple years already, we focused
on application-speciﬁc integrated circuit (ASIC) miners. The gained results for
power eﬃciency, total hash rate and total power consumption are depicted in

Fig. 2: The power eﬃciency increased over time and as of February 2018, the
mix of mining hardware requires 0.049 W/GH. The total hash rate of the Bit-
coin network is estimated to be 30.2 EH/s and the total power consumption
2.2 GW.
Fig. 3. Results for the Ethereum network.
Total Power Consumption of Ethereum: Ethereum is predominantly mined
on (commodity) Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). Therefore, we collected data
on GPU models commonly suggested for Ethereum mining. In comparison to
Bitcoin mining, we were able to rely on speciﬁcations by the dominant players in
the market, namely AMD Radeon and Nvidia GeForce. The results are depicted
in Fig. 3: The power eﬃciency increased over time and as of February 2018 is
5.2 W/MH. The total hash rate of the Ethereum network is estimated to be
253 TH/s and the total power consumption 1.3 GW. In comparison to Bitcoin,
Ethereum mining hardware requires more power per hash. Thus, even though
Ethereum’s total hash rate is less than Bitcoin’s, the power consumption has
roughly the same magnitude. Beyond, linear regression provided best results for
Ethereum while exponential for Bitcoin. Based on these facts, we believe that
there is still room for improvement in further development of Ethereum mining
hardware while eﬃciency gains for Bitcoin will be minimal in the future.
6 Geographic Spread of Miners
After calculating the total power usage of Bitcoin and Ethereum mining, we
have to determine the share of consumption in distinct power grids. Therefore,
we analyze the biggest mining pools of both cryptocurrencies to infer the geo-
graphical spread of their miners. With respect to power grids, we focus on the

following European systems as they are considered to be among the most reliable
networks and rarely face blackouts: (A) The Synchronous Grid of Continental
Europe (UCTE grid) spans 29 European and North African countries10. (B)
NORDEL is a synchronous power grid comprising Denmark11, Finland, Nor-
way and Sweden. (C) Iceland, Ireland, and the United Kingdom each operate an
island network of their own for geographic reasons. These individual synchronous
grids are typically interconnected by DC lines; however, they are only able to
provide a small ratio of the overall power consumption and cannot compensate
major imbalances.
Due to the sources available to us, we had to follow two distinct approaches
for Bitcoin and Ethereum to estimate the ratio per synchronous grid.
Geographic Spread of Ethereum Mining: For Ethereum, we could rely on
regional data from the the biggest mining pool by mined blocks ethermine;
the latter controls 27.9% of the total Ethereum hashrate12. Having access to
individual countries’ hash rates allowed us to determine their share of the total
hash rate; these numbers were then used to calculate power consumption for
the diﬀerent power grids. Finally, we calculated a lower and an upper bound for
power consumption for the respective power networks; all results are presented
in Table 3.
– The lower bound of power consumption is calculated under the assumption
that just ethermine encompasses miners within Europe while the miners of
other pools are outside of the continent, and represents a lower bound of
power consumption. This is insofar a lower bound to power consumption
within these networks as we have ground truth from this pool.

46% in the NORDEL grid).

– For the upper bound of power consumption, we assume that all mining pools
have an equal share of European miners as the investigated mining pool;
this value represents insofar an upper bound as certain mining pools pre-
dominantly target miners outside Europe, e.g., by providing a homepage in
Chinese only. Beyond, the investigated pool is considered to encompass more
hash rate within Europe than others as the pool is run from a European
country.
Geographic Spread of Bitcoin Mining: For Bitcoin mining, we were unable
to obtain country speciﬁc information from a mining pool and had to rely on
more coarse-grained, though publicly available information: btc.com, currently
the largest pool mining 24.9%13 of all Bitcoin blocks, provides a list of success-
fully mined blocks and their origin at continent granularity; this way, we were
able to calculate the share of blocks mined in Europe within this pool to be 7.4%
(March 2018). slushpool.com, third biggest pool controlling 11.7% of Bitcoin’s
total hash rate, runs multiple, geographically spread Stratum servers and pub-
lishes the controlled hash rate per server. Individual miners connecting to a pool
typically connect to the closest server to reduce network latency; this way, we are
able to obtain a European share of 81% within this mining pool. Taking these
two results into account leads to a minimum power consumption of 251 MW
within Europe; splitting this consumption among the power grids as Ethereum’s
consumption leads to a lower bound as presented in Table 3. The upper bound
was calculated based on the following assumptions: (1) For the hyperimage-
https://btc.com/btc.com and slushpool.com, we included their share according
the numbers above. (2) All pools with a Chinese-only homepage are assumed to
control no miners in Europe, (3) the remainder pools are assumed to have the
share of slushpool.com (as ethermine is considered to be an eurocentic pool for
Ethereum, slushpool.com is for Bitcoin). The numbers for Bitcoin however might
overestimate power consumption to a certain extent as the pools’ deﬁnition of
Europe may go beyond the countries in the UCTE, NORDEL, Icelandic, Irish
and British grid.
7 Impacts on the Power Grid
We determined Bitcoin’s total power consumption to be 2.2 GW. In European
networks, 64 MW to 1329 MW are drawn. Ethereum’s overall consumption is
1.3 GW of which 89 MW to 319 MW are drawn in Europe. The impact of an
amount of power consumption is dependent on its share of the total power con-
sumption and particularly the grid’s reference incident. The latter indicates the
power loss that the system is designed for, and its size is equivalent to the
primary control, the fastest measure to stabilize a power grid. Consequently,
imbalances can be compensated within a short period of time (on electrical
engineering time frames). For example, the UCTE network maintains 3 GW in
13 https://blockchain.info/pools.

stand-by for primary control which is fully activated within 30 s. Therefore, fast
changes in power consumption of magnitude of the reference incidents are able
to overpower the stand-by mechanisms and trigger emergency routines. Thus,
we assume, the reference incident value to be an adequate threshold to deter-
mine the potential of a cryptocurrencies’ power consumption to harm the power
grid’s operation. Therefore, Table 3 presents total power consumption alongside
the reference incidents for European power grids.
In none of the power grids the consumption exceeds the reference incidents;
nevertheless, upper bounds are in most cases only one order of magnitude below
the threshold – two orders in the case of Ireland – and both cryptocurrencies grow
exponentially at the moment. Therefore, we estimate power consumption’s devel-
opment in the future by performing exponential regression. Figure 4(a) shows
power consumption in the UCTE network assuming a share of 11% (lower bound,
see Sect. 6), 54% (upper bound) and 33% (mean) of mining in Europe. Even in
the best case, the reference incident of 3 GW14 is reached by Bitcoin mining at
the begin of 2020; in the worst case, in the middle of 2018. Results for Ethereum,
see Fig. 4(b), show that the reference incident will be exceeded in 7 to 14 years.
8 Discussion
Cryptocurrencies and their power consumption are either discussed with respect
to hardware equipment’s eﬃciency or the adverse impact on ecology due to high
overall power consumption. In this paper, we emphasize that Proof-of-Work
cryptocurrencies are in principle able to destabilize power grids. Cryptocurrency
miners draw large amounts of power from the grid, despite all eﬀorts to make
them more eﬃcient and high gains in their eﬃciency over the last years. Our
analysis shows that cryptocurrency mining in both Bitcoin and Ethereum cur-
rently does not represent an immediate danger to reliable power grid operation
on the European continent.

consumption and increased network sizes.

Our results show however that critical values to power grid operation lie
just one or two orders of magnitude beyond the current consumption of Bitcoin
or Ethereum and both grow at exponential rates. For example, the reference
incident within the UCTE network is 3 GW [12], i.e., the respective power grid
is planned to successfully compensate for a potential loss of this amount of power
generation, which is roughly equivalent to two nuclear power plants. Assuming
that current growth rates and the share of miners in the UCTE network are
maintained, the level of the reference incident would be met within 0.5 to 2
years for Bitcoin and within 7 to 14 years for Ethereum. Then, the power grid’s
measures for frequency stabilization might not be suﬃcient any more in case of
a sudden outage of all mining eﬀorts in the respective cryptocurrency – may it
be as a consequence of malfunction or due to malicious actions by an adversary.
In comparison to [7], our attack scenarios do not increase power consumption
all of a sudden, but rather decrease it within seconds, which is more severe from
the power operator’s perspective as the blackout of November 2006 in Europe
has shown [29]. The loss of electric load causes a shift towards higher frequen-
cies, and wind turbines additionally increase the imbalance by stopping power
input at frequencies beyond 50.2 Hz (Germany) or 50.3 Hz (Italy, Denmark) [2]
destabilizing the power network even further. Despite the eﬀort to change this
behavior – a lesson learned from the 2006 blackout – it is rumored that roughly
half of all turbines in Europe still follow legacy guidelines. In case of load loss,
operators can only throttle power plants; this takes multiple tens of seconds
for fast plants like gas turbines but hours or even days for base load plants
(nuclear, coal, etc.). If the frequency reaches 51.5 Hz faster than operators are
able to stabilize the network by throttling, all power plants perform a cumber-
some and costly emergency shutdown. Beyond, our attack is easier to achieve
than the previous approach as the tedious task of botnet creation is largely omit-
ted. An adversary only has to compromise the communication and coordination
infrastructure, smuggle malfunctionality into the software or exploit a backdoor.
All three types of incidents have already been shown feasible or were actually
observed in current cryptocurrency networks (c.f. Sect. 3). Certain protocols and
software, e.g., Stratum, suﬀer from bad reputation with respect to security [27],
and documentation as well as a planned security-by-design approach are gen-
erally lacking. Finally, we outline that our attack can also be combined with a
botnet to form dynamic attacks and exploit resonance frequencies of the network,
as presented in [7].
The consequences of such a described incident would be large-scale blackouts
and the shutdown of power plants due to automatic emergency routines [31].
