Hello
I am a problem with Babel 6.0.17 and importing modules. My files:
js/actions/constantsActions
    export function updateConstants {...}
js/actions/index.js
    import * as constantsActions from './constantsActions';
    export default {
      ...constantsActions
    };
js/main.js
    import {constantsUpdate} from './actions';
    constantsUpdate() // function constantsUpdate is undefined
The problem is in main.js with the expected function constantsUpdate being
undefined. This code was working with Babel 5. Is there a plugin I am missing
or could this be a bug?
.babelrc
    {
      "presets": [
        "es2015",
        "stage-0",
        "react"
      ],
      "plugins": [
        "transform-object-rest-spread"
      ]
    }
