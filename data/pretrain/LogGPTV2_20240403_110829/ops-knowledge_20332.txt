User: Please list some common security vulnerabilities and provide preventive measures.
Assistant: 1. SQL injection attack: The attacker injects malicious SQL statements into the input box to obtain data in the database or illegally modify data. Precautionary measures: The input content needs to be filtered and escaped, and techniques such as parameterized query are used. 2. Cross-site scripting attack (XSS): Attackers inject malicious JavaScript code into web pages to steal user information, cheat, etc. Precautionary measures: The input content needs to be filtered and escaped, and the key information such as the amount and password needs to be entered using the input box or encryption technology. 3. CSRF attack: The attacker forges the user request and sends it to the server to realize the false request of maliciously operating the user account. Preventive measures: Use CSRF Token technology to add Token verification in the request. 4. File upload vulnerability: attackers upload malicious files to the server to achieve attack backdoors, remote control, etc. Precautionary measures: limit the type and size of uploaded files, and perform file filtering, isolation and permission control. 5. Authentication and authorization vulnerabilities: Attackers obtain access rights to user accounts by stealing account passwords and cracking them to perform illegal operations. Preventive measures: use strong encryption, authentication and authorization mechanisms, and strengthen security management and monitoring measures. 6. Network sniffing and tampering attacks: Attackers monitor network traffic and modify data packets to steal or tamper with data. Preventive measures: Use HTTPS protocol to encrypt data transmission, use firewall, intrusion detection and defense system and other technologies to enhance network security. 7. Logical loopholes: flaws in the program design that cause the program to fail to handle certain abnormal situations correctly, thereby achieving unauthorized access, bypassing authentication, illegal operations, etc. Preventive measures: Use strict programming specifications and design patterns to test and scan the system for vulnerabilities, and repair vulnerabilities and defects in time.
