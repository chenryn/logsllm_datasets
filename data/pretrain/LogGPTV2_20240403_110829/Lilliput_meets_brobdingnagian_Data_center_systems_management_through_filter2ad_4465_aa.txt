**Abstract:**
In this paper, we propose that the management of large numbers of virtual machines in data centers will undergo a significant transformation in the near to medium term. This shift will be characterized by the use of smartphones and controlled crowdsourcing to a variety of experts within an organization, rather than relying solely on dedicated system administrators. We outline the research and practical challenges posed by this model and provide some preliminary solution directions being developed at IBM and elsewhere.

**I. Introduction**
The management of virtual machines and the underlying virtualization infrastructure (e.g., hypervisors, virtual LANs) is a critical aspect of data center operations. This management involves two primary components: monitoring for anomalies such as security breaches, correctness failures, or performance issues; and taking corrective actions when such anomalies are detected. Monitoring occurs at multiple levels, from the chassis (using advanced management modules on servers) to the hypervisor, networking, and application layers. A wide array of monitoring tools generate extensive data about the target system, which is then aggregated and visualized (e.g., using Splunk [1]). System administrators use these visualizations to determine if mitigation actions are necessary.

Given the urgency of acting on monitored information, especially in cases of imminent or ongoing failures, control mechanisms have been developed, often tailored to specific applications. We hypothesize that a significant change is occurring in the way systems management is conducted in virtualized environments, and this change will accelerate in the immediate future. This change has two dimensions: the platform used for management and the number of people involved in the management process.

**A. Platform for Management**
We foresee that it will become increasingly convenient to perform systems management tasks from mobile devices. This trend is driven by the growing penetration of smartphones, their increasing computational power and visual rendering capabilities, the mobility of the workforce (e.g., telecommuting), and the need to access systems management information from anywhere. 

**B. Involvement of Multiple Experts**
Virtualization introduces unprecedented interaction among the vertical and horizontal layers of the software stack. For example, the cache usage pattern of one VM can affect the performance of another VM on the same physical machine [2]. This complexity necessitates tapping into a diverse knowledge base, as a single system administrator cannot be an expert in all areas, from web server performance tuning to VM security. Therefore, it will be necessary for multiple individuals within an IT organization to collaborate in a loosely structured manner to address issues.

**Challenges and Solutions:**
**1. Data Ingestion on Resource-Constrained Devices:**
- **Data Volume:** Managing large amounts of data on small, resource-constrained devices (e.g., smartphones) presents a challenge.
- **Wireless Bandwidth:** The limited wireless bandwidth between servers and mobile clients is a critical constraint.
- **Energy Consumption:** The energy available to the device must be carefully managed.

**2. Dependability Mismatch:**
- **Security:** Servers are typically highly secure, while mobile clients are more vulnerable to security threats.
- **Availability:** Mobile clients are not always available and may roam outside the company's firewall, making them less dependable.

**3. Visualization Techniques:**
- **Data Display:** Sophisticated visualization techniques are needed to display large amounts of data on small screens.
- **Actionable Insights:** The display must enable administrators to take timely mitigation actions.

**4. Crowdsourced Management:**
- **Coordination:** Current failure handling procedures often focus on one layer at a time, leading to delays. Coordinated, simultaneous investigation by multiple administrators or domain experts can reduce resolution time.
- **Bandwidth Optimization:** Leveraging the proximity and interests of multiple mobile endpoints can help optimize the use of limited cellular bandwidth.

**II. Management from Resource-Constrained Mobile Devices**
**A. Optimizing for Communication:**
- **Power Consumption:** Communication is a major factor in power consumption for network-connected applications on smartphones [5].
- **Publish-Subscribe Model:** Using a publish-subscribe model with push notifications is preferable to periodic polling, but many hardware management modules currently support only polling protocols.
- **Proxy Solutions:** A cloud-based proxy could perform continuous polling and serve as a publish-subscribe server for multiple clients.

**B. Mismatch in Dependability Characteristics:**
- **Physical Control:** Mobile devices are harder to control physically and can be easily lost or stolen.
- **Security Vulnerabilities:** Most smartphones have known vulnerabilities, and OS-level protection can be bypassed.
- **Reliability:** Mobile devices are generally perceived as less reliable than well-managed desktop-class machines.

**C. Visualizing a Needle in a Haystack:**
- **Alert Delivery:** Mobile systems management applications can deliver alerts directly, guiding administrators to the appropriate diagnostics.
- **Summary Views:** A summary view of all machines in the data center should be the central element, with detailed data and actionable items available through drill-down.

**III. Crowdsourcing Systems Management**
**A. Domain Expert Involvement:**
- **Parallel Workflow:** Multiple domain experts (e.g., facilities, networking, hypervisor, security, application) can examine problem symptoms simultaneously.
- **Collaboration:** A unified mobile application can bring these experts together, leveraging their diverse skills and resources.

**B. Challenges and Mitigations:**
- **Conflict and Security:** Potential conflicts and security breaches must be addressed.
- **Social Media Features:** Adopting features like "friending," "feeds," and "circles" can facilitate coordination and collaboration, similar to social media platforms.

**Conclusion:**
The transition to mobile-based systems management and the involvement of multiple experts through crowdsourcing present both opportunities and challenges. By addressing these challenges, we can create more efficient, responsive, and collaborative systems management practices in data centers.
