### Title: Strengthening Cyber Resiliency in Times of Geopolitical Crises: Applying Threat Intelligence and Active Defense to Protect Critical Information Infrastructures

#### Abstract:
Our presentation is grounded in the long-term monitoring of the evolution, maturity, and objectives of cyber attackers within the Russian context. This focus became even more critical with the onset of the conflict in Ukraine, which expanded the threat landscape to include the Czech Republic as a target. Our primary concern is the protection of critical information infrastructure, particularly data centers that are integral to the upcoming government cloud.

Even before the conflict began, we had been evaluating the capabilities and limitations of our detection tools, aiming to enhance their effectiveness. We integrated Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) into our processes and fundamentally transformed our approach to detection. Additionally, we incorporated elements of active cyber defense (ACD), including strategies, processes, and tools, as a proactive countermeasure.

Our research aims to address several key questions:
- Can ACD eliminate the possibility of a successful attack?
- Is it possible to anticipate or prepare for an attack using CTI?
- Can the resilience of the environment be increased by refining detection rules in a continuous improvement loop?
- To what extent can attacks be predicted based on CTI analysis?

We will present the findings of our research, complemented by practical recommendations on how to integrate a proactive and continuously improving approach into your own cybersecurity practices.
