titleblackhat:eu-22 Strengthening Cyber Resiliency in a Time of Geopolitical Crises: Applying Threat Intelligence &#38; Active Defense to Protecting Critical Information Infrastructures
The basis of our presentation is the long-term monitoring of the development of the attackers on the Russian scene, their maturity and goals. This interest was logically strengthened by the conflict in Ukraine when the Czech Republic also became their target. Our environment is critical information infrastructure - data centers that are part of the upcoming government cloud. So, we just couldn't wait.However, even before this conflict began, we were already looking at the possibilities of our detection tools, their shortcomings and increased effectiveness. We included cyber threat intelligence (CTI) as an input to this process and, above all, we changed our approach to detection completely. We also began to use elements of active cyber defense (whether it was attitude, processes, or tools) as a countermeasure. In our research, we set out to move forward in answering the question of whether active cyber defense (ACD) can eliminate the possibility of a successful attack. Is it possible to anticipate or prepare for an attack thanks to CTI or increase the resilience of the environment thanks to hardening detection rules loop? Finally, with what accuracy can attacks be predicted based on the CTI Analysis?We will present the results of our research, enriched with practical advice on how to incorporate our proactive approach and continuous improvement (loop) into our own activities.
