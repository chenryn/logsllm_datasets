Ethernet OAM Link Fault Management
Juniper Networks Junos operating system (Junos OS) for Juniper Networks allows the Ethernet
interfaces on these switches to support the IEEE 802.3ah standard for the Operation, Administration,
and Maintenance (OAM) of Ethernet in access networks. The standard defines OAM link fault
management (LFM). You can configure IEEE 802.3ah OAM LFM on point-to-point Ethernet links that are
connected either directly or through Ethernet repeaters. The IEEE 802.3ah standard meets the
requirement for OAM capabilities even as Ethernet moves from being solely an enterprise technology to
a WAN and access technology, and the standard remains backward-compatible with existing Ethernet
technology.
Ethernet OAM provides the tools that network management software and network managers can use to
determine how a network of Ethernet links is functioning. Ethernet OAM should:
• Rely only on the media access control (MAC) address or virtual LAN identifier for troubleshooting.
• Work independently of the actual Ethernet transport and function over physical Ethernet ports or a
virtual service such as pseudowire.
• Isolate faults over a flat (or single operator) network architecture or nested or hierarchical (or
multiprovider) networks.
The following OAM LFM features are supported:
• Discovery and Link Monitoring
The discovery process is triggered automatically when OAM is enabled on the interface. The
discovery process permits Ethernet interfaces to discover and monitor the peer on the link if it also
supports the IEEE 802.3ah standard. You can specify the discovery mode used for IEEE 802.3ah
168
OAM support. In active mode, the interface discovers and monitors the peer on the link if the peer
also supports IEEE 802.3ah OAM functionality. In passive mode, the peer initiates the discovery
process. After the discovery process has been initiated, both sides participate in discovery. The
switch performs link monitoring by sending periodic OAM protocol data units (PDUs) to advertise
OAM mode, configuration, and capabilities.
You can specify the number of OAM PDUs that an interface can miss before the link between peers
is considered down.
• Remote Fault Detection
Remote fault detection uses flags and events. Flags are used to convey the following: Link Fault
means a loss of signal, Dying Gasp means an unrecoverable condition such as a power failure, and
Critical Event means an unspecified vendor-specific critical event. You can specify the periodic OAM
PDU sending interval for fault detection. The switch uses the Event Notification OAM PDU to notify
the remote OAM device when a problem is detected. You can specify the action to be taken by the
system when the configured link-fault event occurs.
• Remote Loopback Mode
Remote loopback mode ensures link quality between the switch and a remote peer during installation
or troubleshooting. In this mode, when the interface receives a frame that is not an OAM PDU or a
pause frame, it sends it back on the same interface on which it was received. The link appears to be
in the active state. You can use the returned loopback acknowledgement to test delay, jitter, and
throughput.
Junos OS can place a remote DTE into loopback mode (if remote loopback mode is supported by the
remote DTE). When you place a remote DTE into loopback mode, the interface receives the remote
loopback request and puts the interface into remote loopback mode. When the interface is in remote
loopback mode, all frames except OAM PDUs are looped back without any changes made to the
frames. OAM PDUs continue to be sent and processed.
Configure Ethernet OAM Link Fault Management
Ethernet OAM link fault management (LFM) can be used for physical link-level fault detection and
management. The IEEE 802.3ah LFM works across point-to-point Ethernet links either directly or
through repeaters.
To configure Ethernet OAM LFM using the CLI:
169
1. Enable IEEE 802.3ah OAM support on an interface:
[edit protocols oam ethernet link-fault-management]
user@switch# set interface interface-
name
NOTE: You can configure Ethernet OAM LFM on aggregated interfaces.
NOTE: The remaining steps are optional. You can choose which of these features to configure
for Ethernet OAM LFM on your switch.
2. Specify whether the interface or the peer initiates the discovery process by configuring the link
discovery mode to active or passive (active = interface initiates; passive = peer initiates):
[edit protocols oam ethernet link-fault-management]
user@switch# set interface interface-namelink-discovery active
3. Configure a periodic OAM PDU-sending interval (in milliseconds) for fault detection:
[edit protocols oam ethernet link-fault-management]
user@switch# set interface pdu-intervalinterval
4. Specify the number of OAM PDUs that an interface can miss before the link between peers is
considered down:
[edit protocols oam ethernet link-fault-management]
user@switch# set interface interface-name pdu-
threshold threshold-value
5. Configure event threshold values on an interface for the local errors that trigger the sending of link
event TLVs:
• Set the threshold value (in seconds) for sending frame-error events or taking the action specified
in the action profile:
[edit protocols oam ethernet link-fault-management]
user@switch# set interface interface-name event-
170
thresholds frame-error
count
• Set the threshold value (in seconds) for sending frame-period events or taking the action specified
in the action profile:
[edit protocols oam ethernet link-fault-management]
user@switch# set interface interface-name event-thresholds frame-
period
count
• Set the threshold value (in seconds) for sending frame-period-summary events or taking the
action specified in the action profile:
[edit protocols oam ethernet link-fault-management]
user@switch# set interface interface-name event-thresholds frame-period-
summary
count
• Set the threshold value (in seconds) for sending symbol-period events or taking the action
specified in the action profile:
[edit protocols oam ethernet link-fault-management]
user@switch# set interface interface-name event-thresholds symbol-
period
count
NOTE: You can disable the sending of link event TLVs.
To disable the sending of link event TLVs:
[edit protocols oam ethernet link-fault-management]
user@switch# set interface interface-name negotiation-
options no-allow-link-events
171
6. Create an action profile to define event fault flags and thresholds to be taken when the link fault
event occurs. Then apply the action profile to one or more interfaces. (You can also apply multiple
action profiles to a single interface.)
a. Name the action profile:
[edit protocols oam ethernet link-fault-management]
user@switch# set action-profile profile-
name
b. Specify actions to be taken by the system when the link fault event occurs:
[edit protocols oam ethernet link-fault-management]
user@switch# set action-profile profile-name
action
syslog
user@switch# set action-profile profile-name action link-
down
c. Specify events for the action profile:
[edit protocols oam ethernet link-fault-management]
user@switch# set action-profile profile-name event link-adjacency-
loss
NOTE: For each action profile, you must specify at least one link event and one action. The
actions are taken only when all of the events in the action profile are true. If more than one
action is specified, all actions are executed. You can set a low threshold for a specific action
such as logging the error and set a high threshold for another action such as system logging.
7. Set a remote interface into loopback mode so that all frames except OAM PDUs are looped back
without any changes made to the frames. Set the remote DTE in loopback mode (the remote DTE
172
must support remote-loopback mode) and then enable remote loopback support for the local
interface.
[edit protocols oam ethernet link-fault-management]
user@switch# set interface interface-name remote-
loopback
user@switch# set interface interface-name negotiation-options allow-remote-
loopback

CFM Limitations on EX4600 Switches | 181
CFM Limitations on QFX5120, QFX5200, and QFX5210 Series Switches | 181
The IEEE 802.1ag specification provides for Ethernet connectivity fault management (CFM). CFM
monitors Ethernet networks that might comprise one or more service instances for network-
compromising connectivity faults.
The major features of CFM are:
• Fault monitoring using the continuity check protocol. This is a neighbor discovery and health check
protocol that discovers and maintains adjacencies at the VLAN level.
• Path discovery and fault verification using the linktrace protocol.
• Fault isolation using the loopback protocol.
CFM partitions the service network into various administrative domains. For example, operators,
providers, and customers might be part of different administrative domains. Each administrative domain
180
is mapped into one maintenance domain providing enough information to perform its own management,
thus avoiding security breaches and making end-to-end monitoring possible.
In a CFM maintenance domain, each service instance is called a maintenance association. A maintenance
association can be thought of as a full mesh of maintenance association endpoints (MEPs) having similar
characteristics. MEPs are active CFM entities generating and responding to CFM protocol messages.
There is also a maintenance intermediate point (MIP), which is a CFM entity similar to the MEP, but
more passive (MIPs only respond to CFM messages).
Each maintenance domain is associated with a maintenance domain level from 0 through 7. Level
allocation is based on the network hierarchy, where outer domains are assigned a higher level than the
inner domains. Configure customer end points to have the highest maintenance domain level. The
maintenance domain level is a mandatory parameter that indicates the nesting relationships between
various maintenance domains. The level is embedded in each CFM frame. CFM messages within a given
level are processed by MEPs at that same level.
To enable CFM on an Ethernet interface, you must configure maintenance domains, maintenance
associations, and maintenance association end points (MEPs). Figure 17 on page 180 shows the
relationships among maintenance domains, maintenance association end points (MEPs), and
maintenance intermediate points (MIPs) configured on a switch.

CFM Limitations on EX4600 Switches
Starting in Junos OS Release 18.3R1, Junos OS provides CFM support on EX4600. CFM support on
EX4600 has the following limitations:
• CFM support is provided via software using filters. This can impact scaling.
• Inline Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) mode is not supported. In Inline PFE mode, you can delegate
periodic packet management (PPM) processing to the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) which results
in faster packet handling and the CCM interval supported is 10 milliseconds.
• Performance monitoring (ITU-T Y.1731 Ethernet Service OAM) is not supported.
• CCM interval of less than 1 second is not supported.
• CFM is not supported on Routed Interfaces and aggregated Ethernet (lag) interfaces.
