User: I'm using REPL with sublime text 3 (latest version as of today) and I'm coding in python 3.4. As far as I understand the documentation on REPL if do: tools>sublimeREPL>python>python-RUN current file
then I should run the code I have typed in using REPL. However when I do this I get an error pop up saying:
FileNotFoundError(2, 'The system cannot find the file specified.',None,2)
I get this error whatever the code I typed in is (I tried print ("Hello World") on its own and also big long programs I've made before)
Can someone please help me with this and explain what the problem is, thanks :)
Assistant: I had the same problem, when I installed REPL for the first time. Now, that could sound crazy, but the way to solve the problem (at least, the trick worked for me!) is to restart once Sublime Text 3.
Update: As pointed out by Mark in the comments, apparently you could have to restart Sublime more than once to solve the problem.
