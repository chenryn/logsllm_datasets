User: By default, a Cocoa-Python application uses the default Python runtime which is version 2.5. How can I configure my Xcode project so that it would use the newer Python 3.0 runtime? I tried replacing the Python.framework included in the project with the newer version but it did not work.
And another thing, are PyObjc modules compatible with the new version of Python?
Assistant: PyObjC does not yet work with Python 3.0. According to Ronald Oussoren, a (the?) PyObjC developer, Python 3.0 support is possible, but not yet implemented:

Support for Python 3.x is on my todo
  list but is non-trivial to achieve.
  PyObjC contains a large amount of
  pretty low-level C code, getting the
  details w.r.t. to the changes in 3.0
  right is not easy.  I have looked into
  a Python 3.x port and this should be
  fairly easy, but it's still a couple
  of days work. I'm not planning to work
  on that before the next release of
  PyObjC, that's way too long overdue as
  it is.

I'm sure patches would be welcomed.
