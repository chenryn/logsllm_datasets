Hi,
I have created a benchmark suite for Web Components librairies. Vue.js is
implemented with his web component target feature, and you can see the raw
results here : https://vogloblinsky.github.io/web-components-benchmark/
I will release soon a blog post explaining in detail that, but i want a
feedback of many librairies authors before, to be sure i am not wrong in my
implementations.
Source code here : https://github.com/vogloblinsky/web-components-benchmark
Can you have a look and give me some feedbacks ?
Thanks
