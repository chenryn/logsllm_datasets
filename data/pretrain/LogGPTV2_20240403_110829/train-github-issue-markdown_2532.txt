Subject: Feedback Requested: Web Components Benchmark Suite

Hello,

I hope this message finds you well. I have developed a benchmark suite for various Web Component libraries, including Vue.js, which is implemented using its web component target feature. You can view the raw results [here](https://vogloblinsky.github.io/web-components-benchmark/).

Before publishing a detailed blog post about the findings, I would greatly appreciate your feedback on my implementations to ensure their accuracy and fairness. Your insights will be invaluable in refining the benchmarks.

The source code for the benchmark suite is available [here](https://github.com/vogloblinsky/web-components-benchmark).

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
[Your Name]
