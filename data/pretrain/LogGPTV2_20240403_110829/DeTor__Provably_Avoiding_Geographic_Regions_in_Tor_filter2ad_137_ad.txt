candidate circuits by selecting all possible permutations
of three nodes from this set. For never-twice, we con-
struct candidate circuits in the same way, but due to the
additional computation needed, we only evaluate a ran-
dom sample of the candidate circuits (1000 circuits per
source-destination pair).
For never-once avoidance, we attempt to avoid several
countries identiﬁed as having performed censorship [33]:
China, India, PR Korea, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Syria.
Also, to see how well DeTor avoids countries with high
“routing centrality” [22], we also attempt to avoid some
countries that are on many paths: Japan and the US.
6.2 Never-Once
6.2.1 Who can avoid whom?
We begin by evaluating how successfully DeTor can ﬁnd
circuits to provably avoid various regions of the world.
Figure 4 shows DeTor’s overall success rate for each
different forbidden country and δ values ranging from
0 to 1. Each stacked histogram represents the frac-

tion of all source-destination pairs who (from bottom to
top): (1) terminate in the forbidden region and therefore
cannot possibly achieve avoidance, (2) do not have any
trusted nodes, typically because they are too close to the
forbidden region to ensure that anyone they are com-
municating with is not in it, (3) have trusted nodes but
no circuits that could possibly provide provable avoid-
ance, (4) have circuits that could theoretically avoid the
forbidden region, but none that do with real RTTs, and
(5) successfully avoid the forbidden region over at least
one DeTor circuit.
The key takeaway from this ﬁgure is that DeTor is gen-
erally successful at ﬁnding at least one DeTor circuit for
all countries and all values of δ . We note two exceptions
to this: Russia can only be avoided by approximately
35% of all source-destination pairs when δ = 0.5. We
believe this is due to the fact that Russia is close to the
large cluster of European nodes in our dataset.
The US is another example of somewhat lower suc-
cess rate; this is due, again, to our dataset comprising
many nodes from the US, and thus 45% of all pairs in our
dataset cannot possibly avoid the US. However, of the
remaining source-destination pairs who do not already
terminate in the US, 75% of them can successfully, prov-
ably avoid the US. We ﬁnd this to be a highly encour-
aging result, particularly given that the US is on very
many global routes on the Internet. We note that this
is a higher avoidance rate than Alibi Routing was able to
achieve; we posit that this is because DeTor uses longer
circuits, thereby allowing it to maneuver around even
nearby countries by ﬁrst “stepping away” from them. In-
vestigating the quality of longer DeTor circuits is an in-
teresting area of future work.
We also observe from Figure 4 that larger values of δ
lead to lower likelihoods of avoidance, as expected. This
is particularly more pronounced with Russia, Syria, and
Saudi Arabia; we believe that this, too, is because these
countries are near the cluster of European nodes. Inter-
estingly, this impact is least pronounced with the more
routing-central adversaries we tested (Japan and the US).
Some have proposed defense mechanisms that introduce
packet forwarding delays in Tor [9, 5, 20]; these results
lend insight into how these defenses would compose with
DeTor. In particular, note that increasing δ in essence
simulates greater end-to-end delays, which these defense
mechanisms would introduce. Thus, with greater delay
(intentional or not), DeTor experiences a lower likeli-
hood of providing proofs of avoidance.
Number of DeTor circuits The above results show
that we are successful at identifying at least one DeTor
circuit for most source-destination pairs. We next look
at how many DeTor circuits are available to each source-
destination pair.
Figure 5 shows the distribution, across all source-
destination pairs in our dataset, of the number of cir-
cuits that (1) offered successful never-once avoidance,
(2) were estimated to be possible (but may not have
achieved avoidance with real RTTs), and (3) were
trusted, but not necessarily estimated to be possible. We
look speciﬁcally at the number of circuits while attempt-
ing to avoid the US and China, with δ = 0.5.
This result shows that
approximately 30% of the
source-destination pairs were only able to successfully
use a single circuit while avoiding the US; 18% of pairs
avoiding China had a single circuit. Fortunately, the
majority had much more: avoiding the US, the median
source-destination pair has over 1,000 successful circuits

at its disposal; when avoiding China, this number is 500.
Even the most successful source-destination pairs tend
to have far fewer successful circuits than “trusted” Tor
circuits. These results allow us to infer how well Tor’s
current policies work. Recall that, in today’s Tor, users
can specify a set of countries from which they wish not
to choose relays on their circuit. This is similar to the
“trusted” line in the plots of Figure 5 (in fact, because
we actually test the ping times to verify that it is not in
the country, Tor’s policy is even more permissive). This
means that roughly 88% of the time (comparing the suc-
cessful median to the trusted median), Tor’s approach to
avoidance would in fact not be able to deliver a proof of
avoidance. It is in this sense that we say that Tor offers
its users merely the illusion of control.
All together, these results demonstrate the power of
DeTor—simply relying on random chance is highly un-
likely to result in a circuit with provable avoidance.
Given that there are source-destination pairs that have
only a handful of DeTor circuits, we ask the converse: are
there some circuits that offer avoidance for only a small
set of source-destination pairs? If so, then this opens
up potential attacks wherein knowing the circuit could
uniquely identify the source-destination pair using that
circuit. To evaluate this, we show in Figure 6 the distribu-
tion of the fraction of source-destination pairs for which
a given circuit successfully provides proof of avoidance.
The median circuit achieves provable avoidance to only
1.4% of source-destination pairs avoiding the US; 0.6%
when avoiding China. These numbers are lower than de-
sired (compare them to standard Tor routing for which
nearly 100% of circuits are viable), but we believe they
would be more reasonable in practice, for two reasons:
First, the Ting dataset we use is not representative of the
kind of node density that exists in the Tor network; in col-
lecting that dataset, the experimenters explicitly avoided
picking many hosts that were very close to one another,
yet proximal peers are common in Tor. Second, in our
simulations, we choose our source and destinations from
the Tor nodes in our dataset; in practice, clients and des-
tinations represent a far larger, more diverse set of hosts,
and thus, we believe, would make it much more difﬁcult
to deanonymize.
6.2.2 Circuit diversity
Having many circuits is not enough to be useful in Tor;
it should also be the case that there is diversity among
the set of hosts on the DeTor circuits.

popular Tor routers may become overloaded, and it be-
comes easier to predict which Tor routers will be on a
circuit, thereby potentially opening up avenues for at-
tack. We next turn to the question of whether the set
of circuits that DeTor makes available disproportionately
favor some Tor routers over others.
To measure how equitably DeTor chooses available
Tor relays to be on its circuits, we ﬁrst compute, for
each source-destination pair, the probability distribution
of each Tor relay appearing on a successful DeTor cir-
cuit. Figure 7 shows the distribution of the 50th, 75th,
and 90th percentiles across all source-destination pairs.
As a point of reference, the vertical lines represent these
same percentiles for Tor’s standard circuit selection (re-
call that Tor does not choose nodes uniformly at random,
but instead weights them by their bandwidth).
We ﬁnd that DeTor’s median probability of being cho-
sen to be in a circuit is less than normal, as evidenced by
the 50th percentile curve being almost completely less
than the 50th percentile spike. When avoiding the US,
there is a slight skew towards more popular nodes, as ev-
idenced by the 75th percentile also being less than nor-
mal. When avoiding China, on the other hand, DeTor’s
90th percentile is typically less than Tor’s, indicating that
DeTor more equitably chooses nodes to be on its circuits.
It is true that DeTor may result in load balancing is-
sues, especially if Tor routers are not widely geographi-
cally dispersed – this is fundamental to DeTor: after all,
if many users are avoiding the US, then all of this load
would have to shift from the US to other routers. How-
ever, as shown in Figure 7, while DeTor does introduce
some node selection bias, it is within the skew that Tor
itself introduces.
6.2.3 Circuit performance
We investigate successful DeTor circuits by their latency
and expected bandwidth. Figure 8 compares the dis-
tribution of end-to-end RTTs through successful DeTor
circuits to the RTT distribution across all Tor circuits
in our dataset. DeTor circuits have signiﬁcantly lower
RTTs—on the one hand, this is a nice improvement in
performance. But another way to view these results is
that DeTor precludes selection of many circuits, pre-
dominately those with longer RTTs. For some source-
destination-forbidden region triples, this is a necessary
byproduct of the fact that we are unlikely to be able

to get proofs of avoidance if we must traverse multiple
trans-oceanic links. In these examples, China has access
to some circuits with longer RTTs, because it is farther
away from many of our simulated hosts than is the US.
Figure 9 compares bandwidths of DeTor and Tor cir-
cuits. For each circuit, we take the minimum bandwidth,
as reported by Tor’s consensus bandwidths. Here, we see
largely similar distributions between DeTor and Tor, with
Tor having more circuits with lower bandwidth. We sus-
pect that those lower-bandwidth hosts that Tor makes use
of may also have higher-latency links, therefore making
them less likely to appear in DeTor circuits.
6.2.4 Which circuits are more likely to succeed?
As Figure 5 showed, it is not uncommon for there to be
one to two orders of magnitude more circuits that meet
the theoretical requirements for being a DeTor circuit
than there are circuits who achieve avoidance in prac-
tice. In a deployed setting, a client would ideally be able
to identify which circuits are more likely to work before
actually going through the trouble of setting up the con-
nection and attaching a transport stream to it.
As a predictor for a circuit’s success for never-once
avoidance, we take the ratio of the maximum acceptable
distance (how far the packet could travel without travers-
ing the circuit and the forbidden region) to the minimum
possible distance (the direct great-circle distance through
the circuit). Our insight is that, the larger this ratio is,
the more “room for error” the circuit has, and the more
resilient it is to links whose RTTs deviate from the two-
thirds speed of light.
Figure 10 shows this ratio corresponds to the fraction
of theoretically-possible circuits that achieve successful
avoidance. As this ratio increases from 0 to 10, there is
a clear positive correlation with success. However, with
large ratio values, the relationship becomes less clear;
this is largely due to the fact that large ratio values can be
a result of very small denominators (the shortest physical
distance).
These results lend encouragement that clients can
largely determine a priori which circuits are likely to
provide provable avoidance. Exploring more precise ﬁl-
ters is an area of future work.

6.3.1 How often does never-twice work?
Recall that, unlike never-once, there are no forbidden re-
gions explicitly stated a priori with never-twice. There-
fore, to evaluate how well never-twice works, we mea-
sure the number of source-destination pairs that yield a
successful DeTor circuit.
Ruling out the source-destination pairs who are in the
same country (as these can never avoid a double-transit),
we ﬁnd that 98.6% of source-destination pairs can ﬁnd
at least one never-twice DeTor circuit. This is a very
promising result, as it demonstrates that simple client-
side RTT measurements may be enough to address a
wide range of attacks. In the remainder of this section,
we investigate the quality of the circuits that our never-
twice avoidance scheme ﬁnds.
Turning once again to the number of circuits, Fig-
ure 11 compares the number of circuits that DeTor identi-
ﬁed as possibly resulting in a proof of avoidance (as com-
puted using Eq. (5), and those that were successful given
real RTTs. Never-twice circuits tend to succeed with ap-
proximately 5× the number of circuits that never-once
receives. This demonstrates how fundamentally different
these problems are, and that our novel approach of com-
puting “forbidden” countries on the ﬂy (as opposed to
some a priori selection of countries to avoid with never-
once) results in greater success rates.
6.3.2 Circuit diversity
We turn again to the question of how diverse the circuits
are; are some Tor relays relied upon more often than oth-
ers when achieving never-twice avoidance?
Figure 12 shows the percentile distribution across all
successful never-twice DeTor circuits. Compared with
