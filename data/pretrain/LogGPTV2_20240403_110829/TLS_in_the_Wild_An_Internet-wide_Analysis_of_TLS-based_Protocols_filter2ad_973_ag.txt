## Observations and Findings

### STARTTLS Adoption
- **97%** of SUBMISSION connections upgraded their connection using STARTTLS.
- **71%** of clients who did not upgrade their connections used plaintext mechanisms to authenticate.

### IMAP Server Behavior
- **31%** of observed IMAP servers (serving **16%** of passively observed connections) refused plaintext logins before encryption (with the LOGINDISABLED capability).

## Risks, Threats, and Mitigation

### Current Risks and Threats
- **STARTTLS Semantics**: Less than **51%** of servers support upgrading connections to TLS.
- **Cipher Use**: Up to **17%** of connections still use RC4, which has been deprecated.
- **Certificate Chains and Validity**: A high number of servers serve chains using broken or self-signed certificates.
- **Authentication Methods**: The more secure challenge-response authentication mechanisms for SMTP and IMAP are not widely used; PLAIN and LOGIN are preferred.

### Suggestions for Improvement
- **Observable Infrastructure**: Create awareness through regular active scans and facilitate observation of one's own communication security.
- **Deployability and Configuration**: Simplify certificate management and configuration. Extend initiatives like Letâ€™s Encrypt to include email and chat.
- **Flag-Days for Mandatory Encryption**: Large providers should research the impact of refusing insecure connections.
- **Application-Layer Authentication**: Promote the use of challenge-response authentication mechanisms like CRAM and SCRAM.

## Conclusion
This study highlights the security challenges in the standard Internet messaging infrastructure. While there are better deployments in popular services, many connections are still performed in the clear, and weak application-layer authentication methods are common. The recommendations provided can help improve the situation significantly.
