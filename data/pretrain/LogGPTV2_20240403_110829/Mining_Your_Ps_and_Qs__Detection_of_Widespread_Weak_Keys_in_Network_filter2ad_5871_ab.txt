**Table 1: Internet-wide scan results**
- We conducted an exhaustive scan of the public IPv4 address space for TLS and SSH servers listening on ports 443 and 22, respectively. These results constitute the largest such network survey reported to date. For comparison, we also show statistics from the EFF SSL Observatory’s most recent public dataset [18].

### Methodology

#### TLS and SSH Scans
- **Protocol Handshakes**: We used `libevent` for protocol handshakes.
- **Initial Run**: Conducted from an EC2 Large instance starting on February 12, 2012, targeting RSA-based host keys.
- **Subsequent Runs**: Targeted DSA-based host keys, with runs starting on March 26, 2012, from a UCSD host, and on April 1, 2012, from a University of Michigan host. The second run took 3 hours to complete.
- **Signature Storage**: Stored authentication signatures provided by the server, varying the client string to ensure distinct signatures.

#### TLS Certificate Processing
- **Parsing and Database Generation**: Parsed previously fetched certificate chains and generated a database from the X.509 fields using a Python and C-based parser, primarily based on the M2Crypto SWIG interface to the OpenSSL library.

### Identifying Vulnerable Device Models

#### TLS Devices
- **Manual Detective Work**: Used manual detective work to determine hardware and software generating or serving weak keys.
- **Certificate Information**: Relied on X.509 subject and issuer fields in TLS certificates to identify specific manufacturers or device models.
- **Pattern Recognition**: Constructed regular expressions to find other similar devices in our scan results, estimating the total population of potentially vulnerable devices.

#### SSH Devices
- **Challenges**: SSH keys do not include descriptive fields, making identification more challenging.
- **TCP/IP Fingerprinting**: Used a combination of TCP/IP fingerprinting and examination of information served over HTTP and HTTPS to classify vulnerable SSH hosts.
- **Confidence Level**: Reported device names and manufacturers with moderate to high confidence, but physical access limitations prevent absolute certainty.

### Efficient Computation of All-Pairs GCDs

- **Algorithm Implementation**: Implemented a quasilinear-time algorithm for factoring a collection of integers into coprimes, based on Bernstein [6].
- **GCD Calculation**: Computed the GCD of every pair of RSA moduli in our dataset using the GMP library, which took 5.5 hours on a single core and 1.3 hours parallelized across sixteen cores.
- **Results**: Calculated RSA private keys for 66,540 vulnerable hosts that shared one of their RSA prime factors with another host in our survey.

### Vulnerabilities

#### Repeated Keys
- **TLS**: 7,770,232 (61%) of TLS hosts served the same key as another host.
- **SSH**: 6,642,222 (65%) of SSH hosts served the same key as another host.
- **Causes**: Shared hosting, identical TLS certificate subjects, SSH version strings, or WHOIS information, and manufacturer-default keys.
- **Common Keys**: Six of the ten most common DSA host keys and three of the ten most common RSA host keys were served by large hosting providers.

#### Default Keys
- **Manufacturer-Default Keys**: Preconfigured in firmware, leading to shared keys unless changed by the user.
- **TLS Hosts**: At least 670,391 (5.23%) of TLS hosts served manufacturer-default certificates or keys.
- **Device Types**: Consumer routers, enterprise products, and various network devices.

#### Low-Entropy Repeated Keys
- **TLS**: 43,852 TLS hosts (0.34%) served repeated keys due to low entropy during key generation.
- **SSH**: 981,166 SSH hosts (9.60%) served keys repeated for either default or low-entropy reasons.
- **Device Identification**: Identified 27 manufacturers with apparently vulnerable devices, including enterprise-grade routers, server management cards, and consumer devices.

#### Factorable RSA Keys
- **Vulnerability**: Entropy problems leading to shared prime factors, allowing efficient factorization and private key extraction.
- **GCD Computation**: Applied the algorithm described in Section 3.3 to compute the GCD of all pairs of distinct RSA moduli.
