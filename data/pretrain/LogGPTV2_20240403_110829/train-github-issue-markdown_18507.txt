In Bootstrap 3.0.3, when I use the "table table-condensed table-bordered
table-striped" classes on a table, the table-striped defeats all the table
contextual classes (.success, .warning, .danger, .active) in its rows or
cells.
When only the table-striped class is removed, the contextual classes then work
perfectly within the rest of the table-level classes listed above.
I tried substituting the BS CSS "table-striped" rule so it would colorize the
even rows instead of the odd, but it still fails.
Is this a bug or by design?
