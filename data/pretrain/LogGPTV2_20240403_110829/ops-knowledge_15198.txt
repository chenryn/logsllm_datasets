Certainly! Here is the log converted into a more structured and professional format:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2005-06-17T07:07:00",
  "month": "Jun",
  "day": 17,
  "time": "07:07:00",
  "hostname": "combo",
  "component": "ftpd",
  "pid": 29504,
  "event": "connection",
  "source_ip": "24.54.76.216",
  "source_host": "24-54-76-216.bflony.adelphia.net"
}
```

This JSON format provides a clear and structured representation of the log data, making it easier to read and process programmatically.
