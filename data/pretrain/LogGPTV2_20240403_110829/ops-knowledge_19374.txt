User: Please explain what ACID transactions in the database are, and explain the common technical means to implement ACID transactions.
Assistant: ACID refers to the four characteristics of Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability, which are the basic requirements for transaction operations in relational databases. The specific explanation is as follows: 1. Atomicity: All operations in a transaction are either completed or not completed, and there will be no situation where only some operations are completed. If an operation fails, the entire transaction is rolled back and the data is restored to the state it was in before the transaction started. 2. Consistency: Before the transaction starts and after the transaction ends, the state of the database must remain consistent, that is, all constraints must be satisfied, and all operations make the database transition from one valid state to another. 3. Isolation: Concurrent transactions are isolated from each other, and the intermediate state of a transaction is invisible to other transactions until the transaction is committed. It avoids the interaction between concurrent transactions and data anomalies, but it will reduce the concurrent performance of the database. 4. Durability: After the transaction is completed, the result should be permanently stored in the database, even if the system crashes or other failures will not be lost. Common technical means to implement ACID transactions include: 1. Locking mechanism: By means of locking, only one transaction can modify data at a time, so as to avoid interference of concurrent transactions and data anomalies. 2. Transaction log: records the process and results of all transaction operations, and can ensure data consistency when a failure occurs and needs to be rolled back. 3. Rollback and commit mechanism: When a transaction is executed, it is either completely committed or completely rolled back. If the transaction is not completed, it needs to be rolled back to the state before the transaction started; if the transaction has been committed, the data needs to be persisted to the storage medium. 4. Implement isolation levels: The database implements four isolation levels: read uncommitted, read committed, repeatable read, and serialization. The higher the isolation level, the better the data consistency, but the greater the impact on performance. 5. In-memory database: In-memory database loads data into memory, avoiding frequent disk reads and writes, and improving the speed and efficiency of transaction processing.
