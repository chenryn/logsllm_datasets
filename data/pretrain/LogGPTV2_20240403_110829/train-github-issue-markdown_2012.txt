bug
**What is the current behavior?**  
Webpack is a dependency on this Angular project, and when I attempt to run the
project on Windows 7 (this is important as it seems to be a problem on Windows
7 only!), I get the following error message. As it turns out, it is an error
in Webpack:
    Invalid configuration object. Webpack has been initialised using a configuration object that does not match the API schema.
     - configuration.context: The provided value "c:\\web-my\\insurance" is not an absolute path!
     - configuration.output.path: The provided value "c:\\web-my\\insurance\\dist" is not an absolute path!
I fixed it quickly by modifying line 20 in schemas\ajv.absolutePath.js from:  
`const passes = expected === /^(?:[A-Z]:\\|\/)/.test(data);`  
to:  
`const passes = expected === /^(?:[A-Za-z]:\\|\/)/.test(data);`  
I am not sure if this is the best solution, though.
**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**  
Checkout the angular project at
https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter and attempt to run in
on Windows 7. Then see your console.
**What is the expected behavior?**  
No errors. The paths should work, even on Windows 7.
**If this is a feature request, what is motivation or use case for changing
the behavior?**  
N/A  
**Please mention other relevant information such as the browser version,
Node.js version, webpack version and Operating System.**  
The error occurs on Windows 7 (this is probably the key information), node
v6.9.2, npm v4.0.5, webpack 2.3.1.
