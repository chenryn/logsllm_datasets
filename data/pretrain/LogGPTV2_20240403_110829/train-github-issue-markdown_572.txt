I would like to prevent MUI from optimising classNames:
  * development: `.MuiAppBar-root-12`
  * production: `.c12``  
documentation: https://material-ui.com/customization/css-in-js/#class-names
  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Current Behavior
With `NODE_ENV=production` MUI optimizes the names, which is cool, but I am
using MUI with https://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit and (it may be
configuration noobness), but I am seeing the following code being generated.
Class names in HTML optimised, but styles not optimised:

I've been through the documentation trying to figure out how to disable the
class name optimisation but can't find anything. Should there be a
configuration flag, or am I missing something? As a side note I'm doing this
side project to cut some learning curve, so I may be missing something
obvious.
