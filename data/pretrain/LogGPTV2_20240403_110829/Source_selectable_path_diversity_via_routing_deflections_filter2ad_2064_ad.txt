Table 1: Summary of results for all simulated networks for all rules. Metrics other than medians and > 1 are averaged over all source-destination
pairs, nodes, links or peering trials, as appropriate from left to right. The node, link and peering bypass percentages are intended to convey the
chance that a node, link or peering point could be avoided with deﬂections.
our three example topologies in Figure 7. The value 100% corre-
sponds to deﬂection paths that are node-disjoint with the shortest
path (other than at source and destination). An ideal result would
hug the x-axis then jump to one at 100%, meaning that every node
pair had a node-disjoint deﬂection path. For the networks we show
here, we see positive results. At least 60% of all node pairs have
a node-disjoint deﬂection path under Rule 2 or Rule 3, with larger
networks having near node-disjoint deﬂections even more often.
6.3 Fault Tolerance
The results above show that deﬂections can provide signiﬁcant
path diversity between source-destination pairs. We now consider
how well sources are able to harness this diversity by using tags to
avoid faults.
Speciﬁcally, we construct an experiment as follows. We pick a
random link or node to be faulty. This fault will lie on the default
routing path of a set of (perhaps many) source-destination pairs.
For each pair, we simulate the source as it tries to bypass the fault
by selecting different tag values. To stress the tag mechanism, we
assume that a source tries at most ten tags before it assumes it can-
not bypass the fault, since there is a cost to sending packets to try
tags. For each fault and node pair, we record whether the source
can bypass the failure and the number of tries it takes.
We use a simple strategy to select tag values. In the ﬁrst ﬁve tries,
the source chooses tags 1 through 5. This instructs each router to
try ﬁve pseudo-random deﬂections, if that many exist. (Recall that
tag 0 is reserved to indicate the default routing path.) In the last
ﬁve tries, the source randomly picks a tag value in the remaining
tag space [6,1023]. The intent here is to try to decouple effective
tag choices at each router, since the tag is likely to be mapped to
different values with different primes at different routers. We have
not studied tag search strategies in detail, and better ones are likely
to exist. However, they will only improve our results.
The results of this experiment are shown in the Node Bypassed
and Link Bypassed columns of Table 1 and Figures 8 and 9. The
summary results show that for nearly all topologies the vast major-
ity of node pairs (often exceeding 90%) can bypass single node and
link faults with deﬂections and that these deﬂections can be found
by trying a small number of tags. The ﬁgures provide detail on the
distributions for our sample networks.
Figure 8 shows the distribution of the number of node pairs that
can avoid a faulty node after 10 tries. The x-axis speciﬁes faulty
nodes that are on default routing paths. We rank these nodes ac-
cording to the number of source-destination pairs that use them for
default routes, R. We start with nodes that are on the most paths
because they are the most important ones to be able to bypass. The
vertical lines show the R values, and the points on each line show
how many node pairs can avoid the faulty node after trying 10 tags.
In the ideal situation, all points should stay on top of the vertical
lines, indicating all node pairs that are affected by the faulty node
can avoid it. We see that in all three networks the black squares that
represent Rule 3 stay close to the top of the lines. This shows that
a large fraction of node pairs affected by a faulty node can avoid
it. We also ran simulations for faulty links using the same method-
ology. These results are generally even better, since it is harder to
avoid a faulty node than a faulty link. We omit them to save space.
Figure 9 reports on the distribution of the number of tries that
were made (with different tag values) to avoid the faults. It shows
the fraction of the node pairs that could avoid a fault with a given
number of tries, averaged over the different possible faults. This ap-

Figure 6: The number of deﬂection paths between two nodes. An ideal result would hug the x-axis until 210 and then rise vertically, such that all
node pairs have the maximum number of deﬂection paths. We see that most paths have deﬂections and larger networks have more deﬂection paths.
