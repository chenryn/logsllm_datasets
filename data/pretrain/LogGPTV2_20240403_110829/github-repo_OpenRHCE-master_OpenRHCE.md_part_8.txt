#### Important SELinux Contexts
httpd_sys_content_t
:   For general files and directories to be served by httpd.
httpd_sys_script_exec_t
:   For scripts (CGI) to be executed by the web server.
public_content_t
:   For files that are to be shared with other SELinux protected
    services
#### Firewall and SELinux for httpd
#### Very Secure File Transfer Protocol Daemon
`vsftpd` is Red Hat\'s preferred FTP daemon. The \"Very Secure\"
descriptor refers to the daemon and not to the protocol!
The only mention of FTP in the RHCSA objectives is concerned with
enabling a default configuration
The only mention of FTP in the RHCE objectives is concerned with
securely configuring anonymous access.
#### Installation and Basic Configuration
Package: vsftpd
Install:
    # yum -y install vsftpd
Start and Configure Persistence:
    # service vsftpd start; chkconfig vsftpd on
In this default configuration, anonymous downloads are allowed from
`/pub` (as shown to the client) and are placed in `/var/ftp/pub/` (as
viewed on the server). Additionally, system users are able to login by
username and password and access their home directories with read/write
permissions. No anonymous uploads are permitted by default.
#### FTP Documentation
Man Pages:
> -   vsftpd.conf (5)
> -   ftpd_selinux (8)
#### Investigate SELinux implications for FTP
Find SELinux Filesystem contexts that might affect FTP:
    # semanage fcontext -l | grep "ftp"
Find SELinux port contexts that might affect FTP:
    # semanage port -l | grep "ftp"
Find SELinux booleans that might affect FTP:
    # semanage boolean -l | grep ftp
#### Investigate Firewall Implications for FTP
Find ports that may need to be opened for FTP:
    # grep ftp /etc/services 
#### Configuring a Secure \"Drop-box\" for Anon Upload
1.  Create an upload directory owned by `root.ftp` and with 730
    permissions:
        cd /var/ftp
        mkdir incoming 
        chgrp ftp incoming
        chmod 730 incoming
2.  Modify SELinux
    > -   Set context of `public_content_rw_t` on the upload directory:
    >
    >         semanage fcontext -a -t public_content_rw_t '/var/ftp/incoming(/.*)?'
    >         restorecon -rvv /var/ftp/
    >
    > -   Enable the `allow_ftp_anon_write` boolean:
    >
    >         setsebool -P allow_ftpd_anon_write on
3.  Modify `/etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf` as follows:
        anonymous_enable=YES
        local_enable=NO
        write_enable=YES
        anon_upload_enable=YES
        chown_uploads=YES
        chown_username=daemon
        anon_umask = 077
4.  Modify iptables for inbound ftp
    > -   in `/etc/sysconfig/iptables-config`:
    >
    >         IPTABLES_MODULES="nf_conntrack_ftp nf_nat_ftp"
    >
    > -   Set rules:
    >
    >         # iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 21 -j ALLOW
    >         # iptables -A INPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ALLOW
### Session 10 NFS and Samba
#### Network File System (NFS)
Three available versions:
-   NFS v2 \-- Original public NFS.
-   NFS v3 \-- Extensions and enhancements to v2.
-   NFS v4 \-- Complete redesign, Red Hat default, preferred except
    where backward compatibility is required.
#### Packages
Group: nfs-file-server
Packages:
> nfs-utils
>
> nfs4-acl-tools
Man pages:
> showmount (8)
>
> :   show mount information for an NFS server
>
> exportfs (8)
>
> :   maintain table of exported NFS file systems
>
> exports (5)
>

>
> nfs4_editfacl (1)
>
> :   manipulate NFSv4 file/directory access control lists
#### Configuration
`/etc/sysconfig/nfs`
:   Used to restrict or allow the various versions of the protocol and,
    in the case of older versions, to specify ports (rather than
    depending on portmapper) for firewall purposes.
`/etc/exports`
:   Used to define the directories to be exported, the clients permitted
    to access them, and the mount options.
#### Configuring an NFS server (Network File System)
service nfs start
chkconfig nfs on
#### /etc/exports
    /home 192.168.0.0/24(rw,root_squash) server1.example.com(rw,no_root_squash)
    /pub  *(ro,root_squash)
-   Note: There is no space between the host or subnet and the options
    defined between the parentheses ().
-   If you put a space between them, then you will get a global export.
#### User Mapping
#### Root Squashing
#### Commands
`exportfs`
:   Command to make exported directories immediately accessible to
    clients. If `/etc/exports` is to nfs as `/etc/fstab` is to
    filesystem mounts, then `exportfs` is to nfs what `mount` is to
    filesystem mounts.
    -a Checks `/etc/exports` and exports any directories that are there
    defined as exports but not yet exported. Corresponds to the function
    of `mount -a`.
    -u Used to unexport a previously exported filesystem.
`showmount -e `
:   Used to show exports that would be available to your machine.

#### Mounting
mount nfsserv:/home /mnt/homes
#### Automounter
Automatically mounts a directory when it is accessed.
Unmounts the directory after a specified idle time.
Autofs service controls this behavior.
A master configuration file called:
> `/etc/auto.master`
Sub configuration files
> Usually called `/etc/auto.`
#### Auto.master
Specifies directories to mount under when accessed.
Specifies the auto.\* file to use for the directories.
Example \-- `/etc/auto.master`:
    /misc    /etc/auto.misc
    /data    /etc/auto.data
When a directory under /misc is accessed, the /etc/auto.misc file
indicates how to mount it.
When a directory under /data is accessed, the /etc/auto.data file
indicates how to mount it.
#### Auto.\*
Specifies directory name.
Specifies options to use when mounting.
Specifies what to mount.
Example \-- `/etc/auto.data`:
    pictures       -rw,soft,intr    nfs.example.com:/export/pics
    mp3s           -ro              /dev/sdd1
When the /data/pictures directory is accessed, the system will mount the
nfs export /export/pics on nfs.example.com.
When the /data/mp3s directory is accessed, the system will mount the
local partition /dev/sdd1.
#### Understanding Automount
You must access the destination directory in order for it to automount.
If nothing is automounted and you run \"ls /data\" then you will get no
files listed.
If you run \"ls /data/mp3s\", you will get a listing. You can now run
\"ls /data\" and you will see the mp3s directory listed.
Some commands will cause the directory to be mounted when executed but
may time out before the mount is completed. It may appear that automount
failed. In this case, you may need to run the command a second time.
#### Samba
Samba is a project providing software capable of utilizing the SMB
(Server Message Block) and CIFS (Common Internet File System) protocols
to interoperate with systems using MS-Windows-style file and printer
sharing.
Linux systems can use Samba to:
-   Act as a client to SMB/CIFS servers
-   Provide file and printer sharing services to clients
-   Provide domain controller functionality in a limited subset of
    possible configurations.
#### Accessing SMB/CIFS Shares
-   Graphically, using Nautilus:
    > Use **Places \| Connect to Server**, choose `Windows share` as the
    > **Service Type** and provide the required credentials.
-   Occasional, FTP-like access from the command line:
        # smbclient //server/share/ -U username \
        -W [domain or workgroup]
-   Through filesystem mounts:
        # mount -t cifs //server1/tmp /mnt/share \
        -o credentials=/root/credentials``
-   `/etc/fstab` entry:
        # //server/share /mnt/point cifs \
        credentials=/root/credentials 0 0``
-   Credentials File contents:
        user=
        pass=
        domain=
#### Samba Packages:
-   samba
-   samba-client
-   samba-common
-   samba-windbind
-   samba-domainjoin-gui (Optional Repository)
#### SELinux
SELinux notes are at the top of the config file (`/etc/samba/smb.conf`)
and the man page samba_selinux (8).
SELinux Port Settings for Samba:
    # semanage port -l  |grep smb
    smbd_port_t                    tcp      137-139, 445
SELinux Booleans for Samba:
    # semanage boolean -l  |grep "smb\|samba"
SELinux fcontexts for Samba:
    # semanage fcontext -l  |grep "smb\|samba"
#### Services
service smb start
chkconfig smb on
#### /etc/samba/smb.conf (Global)
workgroup
:   Specifies a shared Windows Workgroup or Domain name.
server string
:   Provides a description of the server.
netbios name
:   Specifies a name for the server for in implementations where NetBIOS
    is still used.
Interfaces
:   Used to bind the service only to particular network adapters or IP
    addresses.
Hosts Allow
:   Used for host-based access control.
#### /etc/samba/smb.conf Security Types
The security line establishes the security model for the server. This
would be one of the following:
> user
>
> :   Indicates that user credentials are held on the local server.
>
> share
>
> :   Indicates that credentials are not kept globally on an individual
>     basis. All who report membership in the same workgroup are
>     permitted access to the server and user authentication in
>     configured in the share settings.
>
> domain
>
> :   Used when the Samba Server has been added to a Windows NT Domain.
>     User access is authenticated through a primary or secondary domain
>     controller.
>
> server
>
> :   User access is authenticated through a peer server that is not a
>     domain controller.
>
> ads
>
> :   User access is authenticated through an Active Directory
>     controller. Kerberos must be installed and configured to
>     authenticate this machine\'s membership in the Domain.
#### Samba Users and Passwords
When the security model set to `user`, local Samba users and passwords
must be created. Typically, these accounts use the same user names as
those configured on the local system. `smbpasswd` is the command used:
    # smbpasswd -a winuser 
#### /etc/samba/smb.conf (Shares)
    [public]
      comment = Public Share
      path = /var/ftp/public
      browsable = yes
      writable = yes
Path must have appropriate filesystem permissions.
#### Testing Configuration
Syntax of the smb.conf file can be tested before restarting the service:
    # testparm
#### Samba Firewalling Considerations
Samba, in its latest version, uses TCP port 445.
For backwards compatibility, UDP ports 137 and 138 and TCP port 139 may
also need to be opened in some instances.
#### HowTo: Enable Home Directory sharing via Samba
1.  Install the appropriate packages.
2.  Start and enable the service.
3.  Configure the workgroup name in smb.conf.
4.  Create the required Samba users and passwords.
5.  Enable the SELinux boolean permitting home directory access.
6.  Configure the firewall.
7.  Restart the service.
8.  Test from another system.
#### HowTo: Configure a Group Share
1.  Create the appropriate group if required.
2.  Create a collaborative directory.
3.  Set the SELinux contexts on the shared directory.
4.  Define the share in smb.conf.
    > Set the following values:
    >
    >     valid users = @groupname
    >     writeable = yes
    >
    > > (Ensure that the directory permissions are 2770.)
    >
    > or, to allow broader read-only permission:
    >
    >     writeable = no
    >     write list = @groupname
    >
    > > (And relax the directory permissions to 2775.)
5.  Restart the service.
6.  Test from another system.
### Session 11 DNS and SMTP
#### Types of DNS servers
Authoritative
-   Master (primary)
-   Slave (secondary)
Non-authoritative
-   Caching-only
Current RHCE Objectives only require ability to configure a few
behaviors of a caching-only name server. The default configuration is
now a caching-only nameserver listening only to localhost.
#### Included DNS Servers
BIND
:   Berkely Internet Name Daemon
Dnsmasq
:   Lightweight Caching DNS server designed for small networks behind
    NAT routing.
We\'ll focus on BIND, but if you have existing familiarity with dnsmasq,
you may be able to satisfy the RHCE requirements using it instead.
#### BIND Packages
bind
:   The Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) DNS (Domain Name System)
bind-utils
:   Utilities for querying DNS name servers
bind-chroot
:   A chroot runtime environment for the ISC BIND DNS server,
bind-devel
:   Header files and libraries needed for BIND DNS development
bind-libs
:   Libraries used by the BIND DNS packages
bind-sdb
:   BIND server with database backends and DLZ support
#### Installing and enabling Bind
    # yum -y install bind
    # service named start
    # chkconfig named on
#### Useful Commands
rndc
:   Interface to BIND.
