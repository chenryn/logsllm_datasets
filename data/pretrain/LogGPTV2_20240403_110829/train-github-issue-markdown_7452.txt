#### Describe the workflow you want to enable
In some cases you need to use OrdinalEncoder even if the dataframe contains
NaN, which couldn't be done at current sklearn version. For instance, when
using KNNImputer to deal with missing values you need first change categorical
columns into numerical, otherwise it couldn't be done. But when using
OrdinalEncoder to change categorical columns into numerical, it requires the
dataframe contains no NaN. So I have to impute first. See? it's head bites
it's tail, couldn't be done. I'm new to it so not sure if I'm think right.
#### Solution
Add "ignore_nan" parameter to it. When "ignore_nan=True" it passthrough the
nan without changing it. When it's False it throws an error.
#### Describe alternatives you've considered, if relevant
Also with LabelEncoder.
