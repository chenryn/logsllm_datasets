I have reinstalled the ejabberd server on my localhost. When I attempt to restart the service using `sudo service ejabberd restart`, it fails to start and generates an error. The following error is shown in the `erl_crash.dump`:

```
Kernel pid terminated (application_controller) 
({application_start_failure,kernel,{{shutdown,
{failed_to_start_child,net_sup,{shutdown,
{failed_to_start_child,net_kernel,{'EXIT',nodistribution}}}}},{k
```

I have verified that all configurations in the `ejabberd.yml` file are correct. Additionally, I have tried killing any processes running on the same ports, but the issue persists.

**Resolution:**
I resolved the issue by correcting a setting in my configuration. After making the necessary adjustments, I restarted the server using `sudo service ejabberd restart`, and it worked successfully.
