I'm new to git. So writting here.
In reset.less we have following lines
    // Prevent max-width from affecting Google Maps
    #map_canvas img {
      max-width: none;
    }
we should add same for VE/Bing maps as follows
    // Prevent max-width from affecting Google Maps
    .MSVE_Map img {
      max-width: none;
    }
