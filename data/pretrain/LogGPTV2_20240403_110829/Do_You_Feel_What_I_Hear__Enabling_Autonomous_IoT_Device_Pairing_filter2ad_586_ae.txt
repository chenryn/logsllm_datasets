### Impact of Background Noise and Distance on Detection Accuracy

While the analysis in Sections VII-B1 and VII-B2 demonstrates that legitimate devices (LDs) consistently achieve high detection accuracy, it is important to note that the ambient noise levels within the court were relatively low. In this section, we investigate how increasing background noise affects the event detection accuracy of legitimate sensors. We vary the background noise levels to 50 dB, 60 dB, and 70 dB, and measure the Area Under the Curve (AUC) for the legitimate microphone and geophone at distances ranging from 1 meter to 6 meters from the event source. The results are presented in Figure 13.

#### Observations from Figure 13

- **Noise Levels and AUC**: As the background noise increases, the AUC for both the geophone and microphone decreases. This trend is consistent across all sensor types.
- **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)**: Higher ambient noise degrades the SNR, leading to an increase in false positives for a given threshold of signal amplitude.
- **Detection at 50 dB**: At 50 dB, both the geophone and microphone can detect coffee and blender events with high AUC, with minimal decline in detection rate as the distance from the event source increases.
- **Detection at 60 dB**: At 60 dB, the geophone's AUC for coffee detection decreases slightly but remains stable. However, the microphone's performance degrades significantly as the distance from the coffee maker increases.
- **Detection at 70 dB**: At 70 dB, the SNR for the coffee event degrades to the point where detection becomes effectively a random guess at higher distances. Even for the blender, the geophone's AUC begins to suffer at greater distances.

#### Implications for Perceptio

In typical home environments, Perceptio may encounter instances of high background noise (e.g., loud music). During such periods, sensors inside the room may not be able to successfully fingerprint events. However, as long as the ambient noise levels remain below 70 dB, the sensors can still detect events with sufficient accuracy for fingerprint extraction.

### Key Establishment

#### Fingerprint Similarity between Legitimate Devices

While we have shown that LDs generally achieve high event detection accuracy under prevailing conditions, this does not necessarily translate to successful key establishment. Factors such as occasional detection errors, clustering errors, and relative temporal offsets in event detection between different sensor modalities can affect key establishment. To evaluate this, we use real-world data to execute the Perceptio protocol and compute the fingerprint similarity (Fsim) between device pairs. Specifically, we generate a data stream of three thousand events, including knocking, walking, coffee making, and ambient noise, and compute Fsim for all feasible sensor pairs. The results are depicted in Figure 14.

- **Overall Fsim**: The large standard deviation in the overall Fsim reflects the variation in fingerprints that will be used and those that will be discarded due to low similarity.
- **Thresholded Fsim**: After applying a similarity threshold of 85%, all sensor pairs that perceive at least one common event achieve high Fsim with low variance.

#### Confidence Score

Perceptio's Key Strengthening Process, discussed in Section V, leverages incremental growth in the confidence score (ConfScore) upon successful iterations of the key establishment protocol. Figure 15 illustrates the ConfScore of sensor pairs over time, represented by the number of event arrivals.

- **ConfScore Increase**: Sensor pairs that reliably and frequently detect common events exhibit a steeper increase in ConfScore. For example, the {geo, mic} pair, which perceives knock, walk, and coffee events, shows a faster increase in ConfScore compared to the {acc, mic} pair, which only perceives the knock event.
- **Stability of ConfScore**: ConfScore never decreases over time. Upon fingerprint mismatches, the ConfScore levels off until the next successful fingerprint matching occurs. This ensures that any mismatches do not degrade the key establishment process but simply prolong it.

#### Fingerprint Similarity between Attacker and Legitimate Devices

The attacker's event detection ROC curves, as shown in Figures 11(d), 11(e), and 11(f), indicate that the attacker's AUC barely exceeds 80% at best and is significantly lower than that of the legitimate nodes. Given the inherent clustering errors, it is unlikely that an attacker can achieve a high Fsim with an LD. To further evaluate this, we grant the attacker two unfair advantages:

- **High T Prate with No F Prate**: We assume the attacker has high true positive rates (T Prate) with no false positive rates (F Prate).
- **Perfect Clustering Accuracy**: We assume the attacker has 100% clustering accuracy.

Even with these advantages, the maximum Fsim between the attacker and legitimate geophones is only 70%, well below the 85% threshold set in Figure 14. This confirms that Perceptio effectively thwarts the attack.

### Deployment Considerations

When deploying Perceptio in smart homes, practical considerations include the potential for simultaneous events. While our experiments focused on single events, real-life scenarios may involve multiple concurrent events (e.g., coffee making while walking). In such cases, overlapping signals may lead to either separate event clustering or mismatch errors, potentially increasing the time required to reach the confidence threshold. Preliminary experiments with simultaneous coffee making and footsteps confirm these observations.

By addressing these factors, Perceptio can be effectively deployed in smart home environments, ensuring robust and secure key establishment.
