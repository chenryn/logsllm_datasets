User: I've been using PyDev within Eclipse on my Mac for about two years now. Updated Eclipse today, and suddenly PyDev is completely missing. Tried everything, included a complete uninstall and fresh install, but although PyDev shows up as installed in the menu, it appears nowhere else.
PyDev version: 3.0.0.201311051910
Eclipse: Version: Kepler Service Release 1
Build id: 20130919-0819
I can't open a PyDev perspective, I can't create a new Python file, and I can't open an existing Python file without it just being seen as plain text.
I've got a huge assignment due tonight, help appreciated.
Assistant: I debugged a python project (imported before). The Pydev menu has reappeared by only changing the current perspective to "Debug".
I think opening the Pydev perspective through Window > Open Perspective > Other ... > Pydev would also create the Pydev menu.
