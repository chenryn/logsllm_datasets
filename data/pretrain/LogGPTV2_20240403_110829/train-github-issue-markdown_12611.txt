    filepath.Walk's WalkFunc (http://golang.org/pkg/path/filepath/#WalkFunc) is documented
    as:
    "If there was a problem walking to the file or directory named by path, the
    incoming error will describe the problem and the function can decide how to handle that
    error (and Walk will not descend into that directory). "
    That is, it returns the stat error for that name.
    But Walk is implemented using (*os.File).Readdir
    (http://golang.org/pkg/os/#File.Readdir), which was changed in
    https://code.google.com/p/go/source/detail?r=100a10512ea4#
    ... to match its documentation.
    That changed the behavior of filepath.Walk to now bail on any errors, rather than call
    the WalkFunc callback with a (problemFilename, nil, errFromStat).
    A fix was proposed at https://golang.org/cl/16100043/
