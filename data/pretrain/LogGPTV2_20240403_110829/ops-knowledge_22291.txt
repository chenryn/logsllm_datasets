User:  Answer the following questions how to modify the mysql password policy
Assistant: In the MySQL database, you can control the user's password rules by modifying the password policy. The following are the steps to modify the MySQL password policy: 1. Connect to the MySQL database. You can use the mysql command line client to connect to the MySQL database: mysql -u root -p 2. View the current password policy. Use the following command to view the current MySQL password policy: SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'validate_password%'; 3. Modify the password policy value. To set the password policy, you need to modify the two system parameters validate_password.policy and validate_password.length. For example, the following command sets the password minimum length to 8, requiring uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters: SET GLOBAL validate_password.policy=LOW; SET GLOBAL validate_password.length=8; SET GLOBAL validate_password.number_count=1; SET GLOBAL validate_password.uppercase_count=1; SET GLOBAL validate_password.special_char_count=1; 4. Create a new user and validate the password policy. If you want to use the new password policy, you need to recreate the user and verify the policy. For example, the following command creates a new user named "test_user" and specifies its password: CREATE USER 'test_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'my_new_password'; 5. Test the password policy. The password generated by the above methods must comply with the password policy rules, otherwise it will fail the verification. Note: When modifying the Mysql password policy, you need to ensure that the modified policy meets the account and business requirements. Failure to do so may cause password security issues or inconvenience the use of the database. And different versions of mysql support different command statements, please pay attention to the version differences.
