## 2. What is Roaming Mantis?
Roaming Mantis is a cybercriminal campaign that began in early 2018. It involves the following key elements:
- **Phishing Sites**
- **Web Mining**
- **Malicious APKs**
- **Multilingual Support**

### Key Characteristics
- **Compromised Routers**: The campaign targets compromised routers to redirect traffic.
- **Multi-Platform and Multilingual**: It targets multiple platforms and supports multiple languages.
- **Name Origin**: The name "Roaming Mantis" is derived from the compromised router (roaming) and the bugdroid's color (mantis). It is also known as "Shaoye."

### Impact
- **Media Reports**:
  - **５７东森财经新闻台**: “少爷僵尸”网路扩散！全球百万笔个资遭窃 (2018/06/07)
  - **TWNCERT**: Shaoye Botnet Affecting Network Devices in Asia-Pacific (2018/06/14)
- **Statistics**:
  - At least 6,000 mobile devices were infected with malicious apps, leaking more than 1 million pieces of personal information.
  - The infection spread to 55 countries, with South Korea being the main target, accounting for 75% of the victims.

### Compromised Routers
- **Rogue DNS Servers**:
  - Primary:
    - 1.53.252.215 (Vietnam)
    - 171.244.3.110 (Vietnam)
    - 118.30.28.38 (China)
    - 42.112.35.45 (Vietnam)
  - Secondary:
    - 1.53.252.164 (Vietnam)
    - 171.244.3.111 (Vietnam)
    - 118.30.28.39 (China)
    - 42.112.35.55 (Vietnam)

- **Korean Targets**:
  - 168.126.63.1 (Korea Telecom / Korea)
  - 203.248.252.2 (LG DACOM Corporation / Korea)
  - 219.250.36.130 (SK Broadband Co Ltd / Korea)

- **DNS Changer**:
  - Observed via 205.209.174.238.
  - Two-step process:
    1. Fingerprinting the target.
    2. Sending an attack payload based on the fingerprint.

### Detection Data
- **KSN Data (August 1-19, 2019)**:
  - Over 98,000 detections.
  - Top 10 affected countries: Russia, India, Vietnam, Bangladesh, Japan, Kazakhstan, Indonesia, Pakistan, Taiwan, Iran.

### Landing Pages
- **Taiwanese Hosts**:
  - HiNet: 1.171.153.177, 1.171.154.9, 1.171.156.75, etc.
  - SEEDNET: 175.181.255.52, 112.104.27.225, etc.

### Multi-Platform Targeting
- **Malicious APK (MoqHao)**:
  - Phishing
  - Mining

### Infection Process
- **iOS and Android**:
  - Accessing a landing page with iOS or Android.
  - Infection with an Android malware (MoqHao).

## 3. MoqHao and SMShing
### MoqHao via SMShing
- **Spread**:
  - Impersonates Japanese logistics brands.
  - Spreads via SMS with bit.ly links leading to Tumblr blogs, which then redirect to a landing page.

### New Targets
- **July 2019**:
  - 黑猫宅急便 (Black Cat Express) in Taiwan.

### Malware Analysis
- **MoqHao Payload**:
  - Contains encrypted payload executed by a loader module.
  - Decryption using zlib + base64.
  - Backdoor commands: sendSms, setWifi, gcont, lock, bc, setForward, getForward, hasPkg, setRingerMode, setRecEnable, reqState, showHome, getnpki, http, onRecordAction, call, get_apps, show_fs_float_window, Ping, getPhoneState.

- **Stolen Information**:
  - IP, language, ID (email), password, name, address, credit card info, two-factor auth, bank info, etc.

- **Crypto Algorithm Improvements**:
  - April 2018: Base64
  - May 2018: Base64 + Zlib
  - August 2018: Zlib + Base64
  - March 2019: DES + ZIP
  - February 2019: Skip 4 bytes + Zlib + Base64
  - April 2019: Skip 4 bytes + Zlib + Base64

### Vulnerability and Fixes
- **Wrong Design**:
  - Reading email subjects to decrypt real C2 destinations.
  - Fixed in 2019 with improved crypto algorithms.

## 4. Attribution
### Goals of the Attackers
- **Financial Motivation**:
  - Creating accounts with compromised devices' telephone numbers.
  - Stealing SMS messages and sending them to the C2 server.
  - Abusing stolen information for shopping, carrier billing, and money laundering.

### Techniques
- **Carrier Billing**:
  - Using stolen credit cards for shopping.
  - Recruiting money launderers to buy iTunes cards.

## 5. Conclusions
### Summary
- **Roaming Mantis**:
  - Targets Taiwan via SMShing.
  - Rapidly improving techniques.
  - Strong financial motivation.
