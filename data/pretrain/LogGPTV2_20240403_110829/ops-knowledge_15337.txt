**Running a Python Script from Any Directory in Windows CMD**

If you are using the Windows Command Prompt (CMD) to run your Python scripts and want to execute them without specifying the full directory path, you can add the Python installation directory to your system's `PATH` environment variable. This will allow you to run your Python script by simply typing its name.

### Steps to Add Python to the PATH

1. **Open Environment Variables:**
   - Right-click on `This PC` or `Computer` on the desktop or in File Explorer.
   - Select `Properties`.
   - Click on `Advanced system settings`.
   - In the System Properties window, click on the `Environment Variables` button.

2. **Edit the Path Variable:**
   - In the Environment Variables window, under the `System variables` section, find and select the `Path` variable, then click `Edit`.

3. **Add the Python Directory:**
   - In the Edit Environment Variable window, click `New` and add the path to your Python installation directory. For Python 2.7, this is typically `C:\Python27`.
   - Ensure that each entry is separated by a semicolon (`;`).

4. **Verify the Path:**
   - After adding the new path, it should look something like this:
     ```
     C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0\bin;%SystemRoot%\system32;C:\Program Files\nodejs\;C:\Python27;
     ```

5. **Apply Changes:**
   - Click `OK` to close all the windows and apply the changes.

6. **Test the Configuration:**
   - Open a new Command Prompt window and type the name of your Python script to see if it runs without needing the full directory path.

By following these steps, you can simplify the process of running your Python scripts from any directory in the Command Prompt.
