User: I'm writing a code to read serial input. Once the serial input has been read, I have to add a time stamp below it and then the output from a certain software. To get the output from the software, I want python to write a certain command to the terminal, and then read the output that comes on the terminal. Could you suggest how do I go about doing the last step: namely, writing to the terminal then reading the output? I'm a beginner in python, so please excuse me if this sounds trivial.
Assistant: You would need to have python implemented into the software. 
Also, I believe this is a task for GCSE Computing this year as I was privileged enough to choose what test we are doing and there was a question about serial numbers.
