of the preﬁxes owned by that AS are counted once as a
whole.
Table 5 depicts the projected PAL dynamics based on
the data set of July 2004. The total number of ASes
observed during July 2004 is 18 048, including 17 884
observed on August 1, 2004 and 164 removed during
July 2004. We can see that the more asserting peers 5 an
AS has, the more PA changes required. We recommend
the scenario n = 2, where each AS has at most two
asserting peers even if it has more than two peers. This
provides a level of redundancy in the case that one of the
two asserting peers fails to carry out its due diligence.
We see from Table 5 that in the recommended sce-
nario n = 2, 16% of the ASes need to update their
PALs during the month. 8.4% of the ASes need only
one PA change in the month, 4% need 2 to 4 PA changes,
1.9% need 5 to 10 PA changes. However, a small num-
ber of ASes need more than 100 changes, and AS 701
(UUNET) and its two asserting peers need around 5 000
changes. While 5000 preﬁx assertion updates in a month
require signiﬁcant effort, we suggest that it is feasible for
a large organization like UUNET (in this case).
6.5. Discussion
The timeliness of PAL updates is important to ensure
service availability. PALs need to be updated and dis-
tributed in a timely manner so that preﬁx ownerships
can be veriﬁed using currently correct information. To
ensure that an asserting peer of a given AS updates its
PALs for that AS in a timely manner, a service agree-
ment between them would likely be required, e.g., an
extension to their existing agreements. Since there is
usually some time delay window before newly delegated
preﬁxes are actually used on the Internet, an asserting
peer should be required to update its PAL to include
newly delegated preﬁxes of the asserted peer within that
delay window. Updates of preﬁx removals can be done
with lower priority since they would appear to have only
relatively small security implications. PALs along with
other certiﬁcates (e.g., ASNumCerts, SpeakerCerts, and
corresponding Certiﬁcate Revocation Lists) can be dis-
tributed with BGP update messages in newly deﬁned
path attributes [25]; thus, they can be distributed as fast
as announcements of preﬁxes and are accessible without
any dependence on BGP routes. Those certiﬁcates might
also be stored in centralized directories [25]. However,
a “pull” model might make it challenging to decide how
often centralized directories should be checked.
To the best of our knowledge, there is no similar study
of projecting the number certiﬁcate updates per AS by
S-BGP and soBGP. We are currently conducting such
study for soBGP and will compare psBGP with soBGP
on this aspect.
5Here an asserting peer of an AS si is selected from those peers to
which si exports its preﬁxes. We expect such a peer would have the
knowledge of si’s preﬁx ownership.
7. Related Work
Signiﬁcant research has been published on securing
routing protocols. Perlman [34] was among the ﬁrst to
recognize and study the problem of securing routing in-
frastructures. Bellovin [5] discussed security vulnera-
bilities of Internet routing protocols as early as 1989.
More recently, Bellovin and Gansner [6] discussed po-
tential link-cutting attacks against internet routing. Ku-
mar [27] proposed the use of digital signatures and se-
quence numbers for protecting the integrity and fresh-
ness of routing updates. Smith et al. [38] proposed the
use of digital signatures, sequence numbers, and a loop-
free path ﬁnding algorithm for securing distance vector
routing protocols including BGP. Thorough analysis of
BGP vulnerabilities and protections was performed by
Murphy [30, 31].
The most concrete security proposal to date for ad-
dressing BGP vulnerabilities is S-BGP [23, 24, 37],
which proposes the use of centralized PKIs for authenti-
cating AS numbers and IP preﬁx ownership. The S-BGP
PKIs are rooted at RIRs, and parallel to the existing sys-
tem of AS number assignment and IP address allocation.
AS PATH is protected using nested digital signatures,
and the integrity of an AS PATH is guaranteed.
soBGP [41] proposes the use of a web-of-trust model
for AS public key authentication, and a centralized hi-
erarchical model for IP preﬁx ownership veriﬁcation.
AS PATH is veriﬁed for plausibility by checking against
an AS topology graph. Each AS issues certiﬁcates list-
ing all peering ASes. A global AS graph can be con-
structed from those certiﬁcates. Thus, the existence of
an AS PATH can be veriﬁed.
Goodell et al. [15] proposed a protocol, namely Inter-
domain Routing Validator (IRV), for improving the se-
curity and accuracy of BGP. Each AS builds an IRV
server which is authoritative of the inter-domain routing
information of that AS. An IRV can query another IRV
to verify BGP update messages received by its hosting
AS. Improper preﬁx origination and AS PATH might
be detected by uncovering the inconsistency among re-
sponses from other IRVs. One advantage of IRV is that
it supports incremental deployment since it does not re-
quire changes to the existing routing infrastructure.
Kruegel et al. [26] propose a model of AS topology
augmented with physical Internet connectivity to detect
and stop anomalous route announcements. Their ap-
proach passively monitors BGP control trafﬁc, and does
not require modiﬁcation to the existing routing infras-
tructure. Therefore, it would appear to be easy to deploy.
In a rigorous study of preﬁx origination authentica-
tion, Aiello et al. [2] formalize the IP preﬁx delega-
tion system, present a proof system, and propose efﬁ-
cient constructions for authenticating preﬁx origination.
Real routing information is analyzed for restoring the IP
delegation relationship over the Internet. They discover
that the current preﬁx delegation on the Internet is rela-
tively static and dense, however they also note that it is
extremely difﬁcult, if not impossible, to determine this
delegation structure.
Listen and Whisper [39] are proposed mechanisms for
protecting the BGP data plane and control plane respec-
tively; they are best used together. The ﬁrst approach
(Listen) detects invalid data forwarding by detecting “in-
complete” (as deﬁned in [39]) TCP connections. Whis-
per uncovers invalid routing announcements by detect-
ing inconsistency among path signatures of multiple
update messages, originating from a common AS but
traversing different paths.
Hu et al. [20] propose a Secure Path Vector (SPV) pro-
tocol for securing BGP. SPV makes use of efﬁcient cryp-
tographic primitives, e.g., authentication trees, one-way
hash chains for protecting AS PATH. It is shown that
SPV is more efﬁcient than S-BGP.
8. Concluding Remarks
Different approaches have been taken by S-BGP and
soBGP for addressing security in BGP. In essence, ps-
BGP combines their best features, while differing fun-
damentally in the approach taken to verify IP preﬁx
ownership. As no centralized infrastructure for tracing
changes in IP preﬁx ownership currently exists, and it
would appear to be quite difﬁcult to build such an in-
frastructure, we suggest that the decentralized approach
taken by psBGP provides a more feasible means of in-
creasing conﬁdence in correct preﬁx origination. We
also suggest that the certiﬁcate structure and trust model
in psBGP has practical advantages. We hope that our
comparison of S-BGP, soBGP and psBGP will help fo-
cus discussion of securing BGP on the technical merits
of the various proposals. We also hope this paper will
serve to stimulate discussion in the Internet community
about alternate design choices and trust models for se-
curing BGP.
