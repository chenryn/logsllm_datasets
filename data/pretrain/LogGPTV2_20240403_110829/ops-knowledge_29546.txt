Assistant: This log chunk shows that the LeaseRenewer process is failing to renew a lease for [DFSClient_NONMAPREDUCE_1537864556_1] for 197-202 seconds. The RMCommunicator Allocator process is also failing to contact the RM server. Both processes are detecting address changes from Old: msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:8030/9000 to New: msra-sa-41:8030/9000. The RMCommunicator Allocator process is retrying to connect to the server with a retry policy of RetryUpToMaximumCountWithFixedSleep(maxRetries=10, sleepTime=1000 MILLISECONDS).
