Here is the scenerio:
  * MyAccountForm extends SimpleFormController
  * MyAccountValidator implements Validator
Within MyAccountForm I override the following method:
protected ModelAndView onSubmit(HttpServletRequest request,  
HttpServletResponse response,  
Object command,  
BindException errors)  
throws Exception
with proper validation and no errors, The framework should call the "onSubmit"
method with the defined signature but it does not. If I override, the
following method:
protected ModelAndView onSubmit(Object command)  
throws Exception
* * *
it calls the "onSubmit" method properly.
I need to access the HTTP request to set session data.
I used my IDE's debugger to trace it down and I could not find any reason why
that above onSubmit method does not work... Any Ideas????
Please see issue# #5420 for similar problem.
Thanks,
