Question: Consider a scenario where a system's performance starts to degrade, and upon inspection, it's found that two services are not responding. The logs indicate that each service is waiting on a resource the other holds. What might be the reason for the system's performance issues?
"A": "The system is experiencing a deadlock due to the cyclic dependency of resource allocation between services.",
"B": "Service A has entered an infinite loop, consuming all CPU resources and blocking Service B.",
"C": "Service B has exhausted the system memory, causing Service A to wait indefinitely for memory to be freed.",
"D": "A third-party API used by both services is down, causing both services to wait for a response."
Answer: A
