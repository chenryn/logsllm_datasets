Hello,
See: https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/master/Makefile#L541:
    	@env JULIA_CPU_THREADS=1 $(MAKE) $(QUIET_MAKE) -C $(BUILDROOT)/test all JULIA_BUILD_MODE=$(JULIA_BUILD_MODE)
This makes the test suite to take much more time to execute; furthermore, the
official CI uses multiple workers by manually invoking runtests.jl with the
`ncores` argument, so there doesn't seem to be a reason to force 1 worker
anymore (if there ever was).
Thank you!
