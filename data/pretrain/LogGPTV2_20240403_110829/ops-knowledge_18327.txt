User: In order to better achieve application load balancing, you need to implement an efficient load balancing strategy. Please provide a load balancing solution.
Assistant: Load balancing scheme: 1. Use multiple servers, deploy applications on different servers, and distribute access requests to different servers through a load balancer to achieve load balancing. 2. Algorithms are used to distribute requests by monitoring the load of servers, so that the load of each server is relatively balanced. 3. Using elastic scaling technology, when the load of the server is unbalanced or high, the number of servers will be automatically increased or decreased, and the load will be balanced when the number of servers changes. 4. Use caching technology to cache some frequently requested data, reduce the access pressure of the server, and achieve load balancing. 5. Using CDN technology, the request is distributed to the server closest to the user, thereby reducing delay time and network congestion, thereby achieving load balancing.
