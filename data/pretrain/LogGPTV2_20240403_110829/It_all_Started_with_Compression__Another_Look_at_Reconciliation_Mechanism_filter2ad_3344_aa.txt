1. introduction
Societies emerging from protracted conflict and violence face numerous challenges 
at  the  individual,  community  and  national  levels.  Depending  on  what  role  they 
actually played during hostilities, and whether their territory or communities were 
directly affected, the effects of prolonged exposure to violence could vary from in-
dividual to individual and from one community to the other. This is particularly 
so for many of the post Cold War conflicts and civil wars that erupted in Africa: 
Liberia, Sierra Leone, Democratic Republic of Congo, and Côte d’Ivoire to mention 
but a few. Accordingly, the needs and coping strategies of those who participated ac-
tively in the civil wars, government soldiers, rebel militias, civil defence groups, the 
internally displaced, refugees, amputees, rape victims; and those that experienced 
other forms of violence, are not necessarily the same. For instance, the experiences 
of those who lost property are not the same as those who lost loved ones and “bread 
winners’. Not unexpectedly, a variety of strategies have been suggested for “healing” 
the  wounds  of  the  past  and  coping  with  the  future,  thereby  facilitating  national 
reconciliation and peace building in post conflict societies. One of these approaches 
is the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, TRC, believed to provide a platform 
for victims and perpetrators alike, to have a voice that would enable them to come 
to terms with the horrifying past.1
Truth and Reconciliation Commissions as strategies for coming to terms with 
the past in Africa came into prominence following the example of South Africa after 
the end of apartheid and the return to majority rule in 1994. In the aftermath of the 
Rwandan genocide, where hundreds of thousands of people lost their lives in a sys-
temic pogrom, the Rwandan authorities put in place local mechanisms, the Gacaca 
Courts, to establish the truth about what happened to promote national reconcili-
ation in general. And although it is yet to be established, the Accra Agreement that 
led to the end of the second civil war in Liberia in 2003, made provision for a Truth 
and Reconciliation Commission.2 From such a perspective it is tempting to argue 
that there has emerged what we can call a “one size fits all” syndrome, that is, if the 
TRC “worked” for South Africa, a point that is the subject of intense debate within 
and outside South Africa itself, then it is “good” for Sierra Leone, Liberia or, for that

Tanzania, and they are called Gacaca Courts. See for instance, National Unity and Reconciliation 
Commission, Republic of Rwanda Opinion Survey on “Participation in Gacaca and National Rec-
onciliation”, January 2003. I would not be surprised if a TRC were eventually to be set up in DRC 
at the end of the war in that country. A Special Court has been mooted already.

matter, any other African society that is emerging from protracted violent conflict. It 
is to be noted, however, that several countries outside Africa had earlier set up truth 
commissions for similar purposes: Cuba, Chile, Argentina, Haiti, among others.1 
The difficulties inherent in such a position are obvious. First, the backgrounds, 
contexts, trajectories as well as consequences of conflict do vary from one African 
country to another. Second, while atrocities are committed during conflict and civil 
wars, their specific nature also tends to differ. In the case of Sierra Leone, there was 
large-scale amputation involving one or both limbs, rape, kidnappings and other 
forms of impunity that were quite unprecedented in the history of civil war not just 
in West Africa, but also in other parts of the world. It was apparent, therefore, that 
the TRC was intended to address impunity and provide relief to both victims and 
perpetrators in Sierra Leone, among other things. 
2. objectives of the study
The main purpose of this study is to draw attention to the TRC phenomenon in 
Sierra Leone, to stimulate discussion on the diverse questions surrounding the Truth 
and Reconciliation Commission in Sierra Leone, especially its impacts on the post 
conflict situation in the country. It seeks to identify the contribution of the TRC to 
post war peace building and reconciliation processes in Sierra Leone; for example, 
if an orthodox TRC was the most appropriate exercise and the lessons that could be 
learned from the experience. Another goal of the project is to document the mul-
tiple and conflicting perceptions among various groups in the country of the TRC 
processes, and how all these perceptions were reflected in the Commission’s work 
and recommendations. It is important, for instance, to find out if Sierra Leoneans 
believed less expensive but more locally rooted methods of promoting reconciliation 
between perpetrators and victims, instead of the orthodox TRC, would have worked 
better. Finally, it is expected that the study will form the basis for future empirically 
grounded research and policy analysis, more extensive research and perhaps even 
collaboration, between the author and those working on the various innovative but 
1. There is, as expected, a very rich literature on the South African Truth Commission and processes, 
although there is no general agreement on what the impact of the process has been on post conflict 
reconciliation in that country. Interestingly, BBC World screened a programme on conflict resolu-
tion titled The Peace Maker and a section of that programme was devoted to the reconciliation in 
Northern Ireland in the United Kingdom. In one of the clips, two men, a victim and perpetrator, 
an IRA operative, confronted each other in the presence of Desmond Tutu. He asked the victim, 
apparently a policeman who was shot if he was willing to forgive the perpetrator, and he said yes. 
He was also happy to know the identity of the perpetrator. The perpetrator explained the circum-
stances at the time saying that he had to do what he did, but expressed regret over the incident 
and in the end, both men shook hands and embraced each other in symbolic reconciliation. Apart 
from those already cited, see also Vora and Vora (2004), Pedain (2004) and Avruch and Vejarano 
(2002).

home-grown mechanisms for promoting reconciliation in post war Sierra Leone and 
elsewhere.
Being a pilot study, the study does not in any way pretend to treat in great de-
tail the intricate range of problems and arguments in the literature, especially with 
regard to the Sierra Leonean experience. 
3. scope of the study
The study was restricted to Freetown, the capital. This is important as the capital 
is more than in many countries in Africa, both the political and socio-economic 
nerve centre of the country. Besides, the war also made it a microcosm of the coun-
try since the conflict drove hundreds of thousands of people to seek refuge in the 
capital  which  was,  until  1999,  a  safe  haven.  Significantly,  many  of  the  displaced 
citizens have not returned to their homes even after the end of the war, giving the 
city an ethnic mix that is rich enough for the study. Finally, Freetown experienced 
unprecedented destruction following its invasion by the RUF and its allies in Janu-
ary  1999.  I  had  extensive  interactions  with  many  of  the  respondents  in  the  field 
survey interviews, as well as other city dwellers who did not participate in the study. 
As expected, most of the respondents who participated in the survey reported that 
they suffered various forms of personal loss in the course of the war, including the 
death of loved ones. They also knew victims of other forms of arbitrary violence 
such as rape, crude amputations and wanton destruction of property, by the RUF 
and its allies, government forces and their collaborators, especially the Kamajors. 
Finally, participants in the study also claimed to know some of the perpetrators. In 
that regard, they were also victims of the war, a point emphasized by the Chairman 
of the TRC, Joseph Humper: 
…all over the country, the scars of the conflict are refusing to heal…The question 
many people are asking is, why? Why were we visited with the conflict? Why were 
civilians the target of attack rather than opposing armed forces...? Why were our 
women and children made objects of pleasure and abuse in the course of the war? 
Why  were  our  buildings  and  other  infrastructure  deliberately  and  systematically 
targeted...? There is no family, village, community, chiefdom or district that has not 
been affected by the conflict one way or the other. To that extent, we are all victims 
of the conflict.1
From the above point of view, restricting the study to the capital, Freetown, has its 
efficacy.

4. Methodology
The study relied on two broad sources of data: primary and secondary. For primary 
sources, field interviews were held in Freetown, the Sierra Leonean capital, over a 
period of six weeks in January and February 2006. Targets of the interviews were 
drawn from a broad spectrum of society: elites/political leaders, religious and tra-
ditional leaders, and members of the public, including ordinary men, women and 
youths, with the aim of eliciting their opinions on the effectiveness of the TRC in 
promoting national reconciliation and peace in the country. The respondents were 
randomly selected, and open-ended interview guides were used. In addition to the 
interview surveys a total of six focus group discussions were also held with select 
members of the four categories identified above. 
For secondary data, extensive library work was done between April and June 
2005  at  the  Department  of  Peace  and  Conflict  Research,  University  of  Uppsala, 
Sweden, during the author’s residency as Claude Ake Visiting Professor. The period 
provided me with enviable access to a rich collection of books, journals, and Internet 
sources. The data obtained in Sweden were complemented with further in-depth 
library research in Nigeria and Sierra Leone. Finally, unpublished manuscripts and 
public lectures I delivered in and outside Nigeria between 2003 and 2006 provided 
additional background material for the study. The next section examines the back-
ground causes of the civil war and its aftermath.
5. civil war and paradise lost
5.1 Prelude to civil war 
Sierra Leone’s contemporary history, political system, problems, conflicts and crises 
can best be understood first of all, by grasping its complex historical experiences and 
circumstances, especially the forces, interests and contradictions which that history 
has generated, and also by closely examining the country’s inevitable location and 
roles in the global political economy. It can be argued that Sierra Leone’s story, like 
that of most other countries in Africa, is one of lost opportunities – a squandering 
of wealth, a “paradise lost”, and the descent from the proverbial “grace to grass”. 
That is rather unfortunate because unlike many countries in Africa, Sierra Leone 
had  a  good  head  start  even  under  colonial  rule,  which  could  have  laid  the  basic 
foundation for economic development and prosperity as well as a thriving democ-
racy. The country boasts the oldest university in West Africa, Fourah Bay College, 
now almost two hundred years old. The settlers and free slaves from Britain and the 
New World, the Creoles, had a good lead not only over the indigenous people in 
the country but also those in other British colonies in West Africa at that time. For 
a long time, they provided the cream of the civil service in the colonial territories of 
the Gambia, Gold Coast (Ghana) and Nigeria. Again the Creoles provided almost 

D o e s   O n e   S i z e   F i t   A l l ?
exclusively,  and  for  many  years,  personnel  for  professions  such  as  law,  medicine, 
teaching and the clergy. The Creoles also supplied the early black missionaries on 
the West African coast as well as some of the early nationalists: the first Bishop of 
West Africa, Samuel Ajayi Crowder, had his roots in Sierra Leone, as did Herbert 
Macaulay and Wallace Johnson.1 
At independence, and like other former British colonies, Sierra Leone inherited 
a Westminster style of government with modifications to accommodate the peculi-
arities of local conditions. And in 1967, the country provided the first case in post 
independence Africa of an opposition political party successfully unseating the rul-
ing Sierra Leone Peoples Party, SLPP, at the polls; although it took over a year before 
the victorious party, the All Peoples’ Congress, could take over political power.2 It 
is rather ironical therefore, that the APC which enjoyed a relatively free and level 
political playing field while in opposition should at the same time instigate the de-
struction of all democratic tenets, practices and institutions during its long years in 
power. The road to dictatorship started with the political leadership at the highest 
level: Siaka Stevens, who had refused to be associated with any particular tribe or 
ethnic group while in opposition. However, soon after gaining political power, he 
tried directly and indirectly to advance the interests of the Limba ethnic group, a 
small group that was hitherto unknown for its political ambitions, and bring them 
into the limelight of national politics and culture. Soon, Limba became one of the 
national languages, and with that, the rendition of national news in Limba became 
mandatory. The president and the APC tried spiritedly to advance Limba interests 
in other spheres such as employment, the army, scholarships, etc. To effectively pur-
sue the politics of exclusion and ethnicity, the elites formed the Ekute club, made up 
of senior political office holders, civil servants, traditional rulers and educated Lim-
bas from all walks of life who assiduously peddled and executed the Limba agenda 
in the country to the indignation and frustration of the Mende and Temne ethnic 
groups who constituted more than half of the country’s population, and who once 
dominated post independence politics and the political scene in the country. 
Stevens  and  the  APC  also  assaulted  the  judiciary,  which  became  virtually 
subservient to the presidency, especially on sensitive political issues. For instance, 
the Chief Justice and Attorney General held office at the pleasure of the president. 
Other judges could face premature retirement if they became uncontrollable and 
too independent. The press was not spared either. By the early 1980s, it had been 
successfully gagged as all independent newspapers were forced out of business by 
draconian  press  laws.3 Although  he  cultivated  a  political  reputation  through  and 
received support from the Trade Union Congress as former General Secretary of the

Miners’ Union, Stevens also appreciated the power of labour and soon emasculated 
it.  Collective  bargaining  became  impossible  while  strikes  were  to  all  intents  and 
purposes  banned.1  The  APC  emasculated  civil  society  forces  and  groups,  paying 
particular attention to students who were in the vanguard of the opposition move-
ment that vehemently resisted authoritarian rule from 1967. 
The last straw, however, was the creation of a one party state in Sierra Leone in 
1978.2 For several years before then, the country had operated as a de facto one party 
state, following the disappearance of the opposition parties in Parliament and the 
appointment of the armed forces commander as member of Parliament and minister 
of state in the Ministry of Defence. Thereafter, Stevens and his cronies targeted the 
commanding heights of the economy, the diamond industry, and the Central Bank 
of Sierra Leone, turning them to conduits for siphoning off scarce foreign exchange. 
Indeed, the popular saying, commonly used even by the president, is: “wu si then 
tie cow na dey e go eat”, which literally translates as, “a cow grazes where it is tied”.  
Eddie Momoh, ace journalist, poignantly captured this phenomenon thus:
For the most part, it would seem that Stevens was convinced that whosoever control-
led the state resources…could build personal power. He dished out state resources as 
political patronage. He doled out huge sums of money… “as if money grew on trees”. 
He wanted money even when he had enough.3
Another keen observer of the political scene then, had this to say:
…allocating the foreign exchange proceeds became the subject for presidential ap-
proval. It is a unique situation, as the central bank was completely rendered redun-
dant by the arrangement, which also vested a lot of patronage in Stevens.4 
Quite as expected, the social sector, education, health, water supply, roads, transport 
etc, broke down completely under the weight of the corrupt and prebendal system. 
Widespread unemployment left many youths without means of livelihood. Expect-
edly, they felt excluded, marginalized and angry towards a system that had virtually 
reduced them to vagabonds and beggars in their own country. This situation ac-
counted for what some scholars have put forward as the “greed and grievance” thesis 
in explaining the events in Sierra Leone that led to the war in 1991.5 
The exit of Stevens and his replacement by a hand picked successor and former 
Commander of the Armed Forces of Sierra Leone, Major-General Joseph Momoh 
in  1985,  did  not  ease  the  pains  of  daily  survival  for  the  majority  of  the  popula-
