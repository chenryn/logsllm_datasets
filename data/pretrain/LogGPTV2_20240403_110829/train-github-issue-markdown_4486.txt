# Description of the new feature/enhancement
On WSL, Typing `clear` or pressing `CTRL+L` clears the scroll buffer history
while most Linux terminals(both real ones like gnome-terminal, and virtual
ones like tmux) move the scroll history instead of clearing it. Can we use
same semantics for Windows Terminal?
