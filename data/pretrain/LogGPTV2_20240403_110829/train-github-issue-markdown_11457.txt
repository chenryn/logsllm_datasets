### Current Behavior

When using reactive forms in Angular, if Swedish characters (å, ä, ö) are included in an input field's placeholder, the form and the input field are incorrectly marked as "dirty" upon initialization. This issue is specific to Internet Explorer 11 (and possibly earlier versions of IE).

### Expected Behavior

The form and input field should not be marked as "dirty" simply because Swedish characters are used in the placeholder text.

### Minimal Reproduction

To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:
- Visit the following Plunker: [http://plnkr.co/edit/u3iEtQ?p=preview](http://plnkr.co/edit/u3iEtQ?p=preview)
- Note that the old Plunker ([http://plnkr.co/edit/LpZNI9m7j8m8tgXRFdVG?p=preview](http://plnkr.co/edit/LpZNI9m7j8m8tgXRFdVG?p=preview)) contains a typo and does not work correctly.

### Motivation for Changing the Behavior

This is a bug that needs to be fixed to ensure consistent and correct behavior across all supported browsers.

### Environment Details

- **Operating System:** Windows 10
