**Current behavior**  
Using reactive forms. When swedish letters (åäö) is used in a input
placeholder, the form and input is initialized as dirty.
This only affects IE11, or perhaps also earlier versions of IE.
**Expected behavior**  
The form and input should not be dirty because of swedish letters in
placeholder.
