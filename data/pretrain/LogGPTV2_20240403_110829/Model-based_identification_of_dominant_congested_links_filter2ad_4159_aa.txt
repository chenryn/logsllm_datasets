ABSTRACT
In this paper, we propose a model-based approach that uses
periodic end-end probes to identify whether a “dominant
congested link” exists along an end-end path.
Informally,
a dominant congested link refers to a link that incurs the
most losses and signiﬁcant queuing delays along the path.
We begin by providing a formal yet intuitive deﬁnition of
dominant congested link and present two simple hypothe-
sis tests to identify whether such a link exists. We then
present and examine several novel model-based approaches
for identifying a dominant congested link that are based on
interpreting probe loss as an unobserved (virtual) delay. We
develop parameter inference algorithms for Hidden Markov
Model (HMM) and Markov model with a hidden dimension
to infer this virtual delay. Our validation using ns simu-
lation and live Internet experiments demonstrate that this
approach can correctly identify a dominant congested link
with only a small amount of probe data. We further estimate
the maximum queuing delay of the dominant congested link,
once we identify that a dominant congested link exists.

INTRODUCTION
Measurement and inference of end-end path characteris-
tics have attracted a tremendous amount of attention in
recent years. Properties such as the delay and loss charac-
teristics of the end-end path [1], the minimum capacity and
available bandwidth of the path [2, 3, 4, 5, 6] and the sta-
tionarity of the network [7] have been investigated. These ef-
forts have improved our understanding of the Internet. They
have also proved valuable in helping to manage and diagnose
heterogeneous and complex networks. Furthermore, they
have been exploited by several applications, such as server
selection, overlay networks and streaming applications, to
improve performance [8, 9].
In this paper, we study a speciﬁc end-end path charac-
teristic, namely, whether a dominant congested link exists
along an end-end path. Informally, a dominant congested
link is one that produces most of the losses and signiﬁcant
queuing delays on the end-end path. A formal deﬁnition is
deferred to a later section in the paper. We avoid using the
term “bottleneck link”, since this term has been deﬁned in
many diﬀerent ways in the literature (see e.g.
[4, 10, 11,
12]) and there is no consensus on its meaning. Later in the
paper, we relate our deﬁnition of dominant congested link
to the notion of a bottleneck link.
Identifying the existence of a dominant congested link is
useful for traﬃc engineering. For example, when there are
multiple paths from one host to another and all are con-
gested, improving the quality along a path with one domi-
nant congested link may require fewer resources than along
a path with multiple congested links. Identifying if a path
has a dominant congested link also helps us understand the
dynamics of the network since the behavior of a network
with a dominant congested link diﬀers dramatically from
one with multiple congested links. When modeling a net-
work, people usually assume that there is a single congested
link (e.g. [13, 14]). One reason for this is that it is a good
starting point, since this assumption usually simpliﬁes the
analysis signiﬁcantly. Another more important reason might
be that it is widely believed to be true. However, there ex-
ist no large scale measurements supporting this assumption,
and to the best of our knowledge, there is no practical and
eﬃcient methodology for this purpose. Our work aims to
provide such a methodology.
When a dominant congested link exists, identifying the
existence of such a link requires distinguishing its delay and
loss characteristics from those of the other links.
Identi-
fying such a link via direct measurement is only possible
to the organization in charge of that network. Commer-
cial factors often prevent an organization from disclosing
the performance of internal links. Furthermore, as the In-
ternet grows in both size and diversity, one organization
may only be responsible for a subset of links on an end-end
path. Some measurement techniques obtain internal prop-
erties of a path by using ICMP messages to query internal
routers. Traceroute and ping are two widely used tools in
this category. Some more advanced techniques use ICMP
messages to measure per-hop capacity or delay [15, 16, 17].
However, we are not aware of any work using ICMP mes-
sages to measure per-hop loss rate. This might be because
ICMP queries can be dropped at a router for reasons other
than buﬀer overﬂow. Contrary to direct measurements us-
ing responses from routers, a collection of techniques infer
internal loss rate and delay characteristics using end-end
measurement [18, 19, 20]. Most existing work in this cate-
gory, however, are unable to identify behavior of individual
links.
In this paper, we propose a novel model-based approach
to identify whether a dominant congested link exists along
an end-end path using end-end measurements. We periodi-
cally send probes from one host to another so as to obtain
a sequence of delay and loss values. The key insight in our
approach is to utilize the queuing delay properties of the
lost probes. For example, if one link along the path is solely
responsible for all losses, then all lost probes have the prop-
erty that they “see” a full queue at this link. We interpret
a loss as an unobserved delay and discretize the delay val-
ues. Afterwards, we model the discretized delay sequence
of all probes including those with missing values to infer if
a dominant congested link exists. This model utilizes the
delay and loss observations jointly for inference instead of
the common approach of treating them separately. Further-
more, the model makes use of the correlation in the entire
observation sequence instead of the very limited temporal
correlation present in back-to-back packets. As we will see,
the identiﬁcation procedure only requires a short probing
duration, in terms of minutes.
The following are the main contributions of this paper:
• We present a formal yet intuitive deﬁnition of domi-
nant congested link and provide two simple hypothesis
tests to identify the existence of dominant congested
link along a path.
• Our model-based approach fully utilizes the informa-
tion from the probing packets and enables very fast
identiﬁcation. Validation using ns simulation [21] and
Internet experiments demonstrate that this approach
can correctly identify the existence of a dominant con-
gested link within minutes.
• As a result of the identiﬁcation procedure, we provide
a statistical upper bound on the maximum queuing
delay of the dominant congested link once we identify
that a dominant congested link exists.
Related work [10, 11] study how to detect shared con-
gested links over multiple paths. Their focus, however, is
diﬀerent from ours. The work closest in spirit to ours is
the loss pair approach to discover network properties [12,

22]. A loss pair is formed when two packets are sent close in
time and only one of the packets is lost. Assuming that the
two packets experience similar behaviors along the path, the
packets not lost in the loss pairs are used to provide insights
on network conditions close to the time that loss occurs.
Although our work also uses properties of lost packets, it
has diﬀerent objectives from [12, 22]. The authors of [12] do
not address the issue of identifying whether a dominant con-
gested link exists but start by assuming that a bottleneck
link exists along the path and use loss pairs to determine the
maximum queuing delay at the bottleneck link. The authors
of [22] use a hidden Markov model to classify if a packet loss
occurs at a wired or a wireless part of the network based on
the measurements of loss pairs. We focus on whether a dom-
inant congested link exists along a path. Furthermore, our
model-based approach diﬀers signiﬁcantly from the loss pair
approach: our approach infers the properties of lost pack-
ets by utilizing the delay and loss observations jointly and
the correlation in the entire observation sequence, instead of
direct measurements from the loss pairs.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Sections 2
and 3, we provide a formal deﬁnition of a dominant con-
gested link and describe a methodology to identify whether
a dominant congested link exists along a path. Section 4
presents the model-based approach. Section 5 validates the
methodology using ns simulation and Internet experiments.
Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper and describes future
work.
2. DEFINITION OF DOMINANT CONGESTED
LINK
In this section, we formally deﬁne a dominant congested
link and relate it to the widely used term “bottleneck link”.
A bottleneck link is typically deﬁned to be a link with either
high loss rate, long queuing delay, high utilization or low link
bandwidth; sometimes multiple perspectives are included in
one deﬁnition [4, 10, 11, 12]. Although no consensus has
been reached, the various deﬁnitions intuitively consider a
bottleneck link (directly or indirectly) to be a link that pro-
duces most of the losses and/or signiﬁcant queuing delays
along a path.
We deﬁne dominant congested link based on the loss and
end-end queuing delay experienced by the probes sent along
the path of interest. Parameters are introduced to quantify
the extent of loss and queuing delay that qualify a link as a
dominant congested link. Furthermore, our deﬁnition from
the end-end performance of the probes allows us to account
for the dynamic nature of an end-end path.
Before providing a formal deﬁnition, we introduce some

notations summarized in Table 1. Assume there are K
links/routers along the path of interest, as shown in Fig-
ure 1. Each link/router is modeled by a droptail queue with
a processing rate equal to the link bandwidth and the max-
imum queue size equal to the buﬀer size of the router. Let
Qk denote the maximum queuing delay at queue k, i.e., the
time required to drain a full queue. Qk is determined by the
buﬀer size and the link bandwidth. Probes are sent period-
ically from the source to the destination. The existence of a
dominant congested link in a time interval [t1, t2), where t2
can be ∞, is determined from measurements of the probes.
For ease of exposition, we introduce the concept of a vir-
tual probe. A virtual probe goes through all the links along
the path and records the delay (both propagation and queu-
ing delay) at each link. If it “sees” a full queue when reach-
ing router k, it records the maximum queuing delay Qk and
marks itself as lost. Otherwise, it calculates the queuing de-
lay from the current queue length and the link bandwidth.
The end-end delay for a virtual probe is the sum of its delays
over all the links along the path. A virtual probe diﬀers from
a real probe in that it traverses all the links even if “lost”
at some link. Furthermore, it does not occupy a position
in the queue and hence does not aﬀect packets that arrive
afterwards. We refer to a virtual probe marked as lost at
some link as a probe with a loss mark. Note that a virtual
probe can be marked as lost at most once. This is consistent
with the fact that a real probe can only be lost once.
Consider an arbitrary virtual probe sent at time t from the
source, where t ∈ [t1, t2). We use the sending time t to index
the virtual probe. That is, we use virtual probe t to refer to
a virtual probe that is sent at time t from the source. Let Dk
be the queuing delay for virtual probe t at link k, 1 ≤ k ≤ K.

assume that the queuing delay for a probe taking the last
available position at router k is Qk. In practice, these two
values are very close, since a probe is very small relative to
the full queue size. Therefore, Fk contains all the probes
that are either marked as lost at link k or take the last free
buﬀer position at link k. Since t ∈ Lk ⇒ Dk
