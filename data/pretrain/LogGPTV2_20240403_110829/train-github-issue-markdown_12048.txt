##### OS / ENVIRONMENT
Controller: ansible-2.2.0.0  
Controlled node: FreeBSD
##### SUMMARY
I have a role, ossec_hids_agent, which has a dependency on a subordinate role,
ossec_hids_common. The subordinate role has a dynamic task include and loads
tasks from ossec_hids_agent space. I believe this is incorrect, a child role
should not run tasks defined in it's parent.
This behaviour changed in ansible-2.2.0.0  
ansible-2.1.3.0 has what I consider the correct behaviour
##### STEPS TO REPRODUCE
**roles/ossec_hids_agent/meta/main.yml** :
    dependencies:
      - role: ossec_hids_common
**roles/ossec_hids_common_tasks/config.yml** (included from main.yml):
    - name: Include OS-specific config tasks.
      include: "{{ item }}"
      with_first_found:
        ...
        - "./includes/{{ ansible_distribution }}-config.yml"
        ...
**ls roles/ossec_hids_agent/tasks/includes/** :  
FreeBSD-config.yml
**ls roles/ossec_hids_common/tasks/includes/** :  
**playbooks/test/ossec_hids.yml** :
    - hosts: ossec-agent
      roles:
      - role: ossec_hids_agent
        tags: [ "ossec", "ossec-agent" ]
**playbook command** :
    ansible-playbook playbooks/test/ossec_hids.yml -b -D -t ossec-agent
The intent is that on e.g. a FreeBSD node, if a file includes/FreeBSD-
config.yml exists, it will be included and executed. I expect that
ossec_hids_common will only include files defined in it's own role structure
and not search through the parent's includes as well
##### EXPECTED RESULTS
The include in ossec_hids_common should be a noop
##### ACTUAL RESULTS
**ansible-2.2.0.0** :
    TASK [ossec_hids_common : Include OS-specific config tasks.] *******************
    included: /home/alan/gitwork/ansible/roles/role_ossec_hids_agent/tasks/includes/FreeBSD-config.yml for freebsd-9-3, freebsd-10-2, freebsd-10-3
Clearly, the child role is including files defined in it's parent.
**ansible-2.1.3.0**
    TASK [ossec_hids_common : Include OS-specific config tasks.] *******************
    TASK [ossec_hids_common : Enable ossec_hids_common services] *******************
With this version the operation is a noop
