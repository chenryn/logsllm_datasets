Subject: Assistance Needed: TensorFlow Installation and Execution Errors on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS

Hello Everyone,

I hope this message finds you well. I am currently facing some challenges with running a TensorFlow tutorial code that I obtained from the official TensorFlow website. Despite my efforts, including trying to install TensorFlow from source, I continue to encounter several errors. As a result, I uninstalled all previous installations and reinstalled TensorFlow on my system, which is running Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. Unfortunately, the problem persists.

As someone new to TensorFlow, I have been struggling with these issues for about two months now, making it difficult to proceed with my learning and projects. Your expertise would be greatly appreciated in helping me resolve these problems, as resolving them has become quite urgent.

Below, I've attached an image of the error messages I'm receiving. Any guidance or suggestions you could provide would be immensely helpful.
