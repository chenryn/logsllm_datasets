User: I installed Anaconda a while ago but recently decided to uninstall it and just install basic python 2.7.
I removed Anaconda and deleted all the directories and installed python 2.7.
But when I go to install PyGTK for Windows it says it will install it to the c:/users/.../Anaconda directory - this doesn't even exist. I want to install it to the c:/python-2.7 directory. Why does it think Anaconda is still installed? And how can I change this?
Assistant: For windows-

In the Control Panel, choose Add or Remove Programs or Uninstall a program, and then select Python 3.6 (Anaconda) or your version of Python.
Use Windows Explorer to delete the envs and pkgs folders prior to Running the uninstall in the root of your installation.
