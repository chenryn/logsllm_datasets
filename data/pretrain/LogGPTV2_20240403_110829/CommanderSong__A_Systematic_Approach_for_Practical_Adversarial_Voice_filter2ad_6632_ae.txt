#### Table 7: Detailed Results of Individual Songs in Human Comprehension Survey for WTA Samples

When we were checking the survey results from MTurk, we found that the average familiarity of MTurk workers towards our songs was not as good as expected. Therefore, streaming counts from Spotify are also listed in the table to show the popularity of our sample songs. The song "Selling Brick in Street" is not in the Spotify database, so we cannot provide the count for it.

#### Table 8: Detailed Information of Some Sample Applications Utilizing iFLYTEK as Voice Input

This table includes the number of downloads from Google Play and the total user amount. Since Google Services are not accessible in China and information from the Apple App Store is not collected, the number of users may not be directly associated with the number of downloads in Google Play. As shown in the table, each of these applications has over 0.2 billion users worldwide.
