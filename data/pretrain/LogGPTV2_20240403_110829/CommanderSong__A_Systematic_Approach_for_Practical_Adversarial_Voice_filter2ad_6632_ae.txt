Appendix
Table 7: The detailed results of individual song in human comprehension survey for WTA samples. When we were
checking the survey results from MTurk, we found the average familiarity of MTurk workers towards our songs is not
as good as we expected. So streaming counts from Spotify are also listed in the table, as we want to show the popularity
of our sample songs. The song Selling Brick in Street is not in Spotify database so we can not provide the count for it.

Table 8: The detailed information of some sample applications which utilize iFLYTEK as voice input, including
number of downloads from Google Play and total user amount. Since Google Services are not accessible in China
and information of Apple App Store is not collected, the number of users may not be associated with the number of
downloads in Google Play. As shown in the table, each of these applications has over 0.2 billion users in the world.
