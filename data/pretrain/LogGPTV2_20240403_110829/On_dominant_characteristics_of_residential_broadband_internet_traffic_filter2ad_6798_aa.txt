## Abstract

Residential broadband Internet access is widely available in many parts of the world, yet few studies have examined the characteristics of such traffic. This paper presents observations from monitoring the network activity of over 20,000 residential DSL customers in an urban area. To ensure privacy, all data was immediately anonymized. The anonymized packet traces were augmented with information about DSL-level sessions, IP (re-)assignments, and DSL link bandwidth.

Our analysis reveals several surprising findings compared to the mental models derived from existing literature. For example, HTTP traffic, not peer-to-peer, dominates by a significant margin. Additionally, we found that the home user's immediate ISP connectivity often contributes more to round-trip times than the wide-area portion of the path, and DSL lines are frequently not the bottleneck in bulk-transfer performance.

## 1. Introduction

Residential broadband Internet connectivity is a mature service in many countries, allowing users to integrate network use into their daily lives for various activities such as checking weather, shopping, banking, and communicating with family and friends. However, the nature of this connectivity differs significantly from previously studied environments like campus networks and enterprises.

First, residential users often have different goals and are not subject to the same strict acceptable use policies that may regulate their access at work or school. Additionally, residential users who set up hosts and equipment often lack system administration expertise and are primarily focused on making things work. Finally, researchers rarely have large-scale access to residential traffic, leading to underexamined dynamics and variations.

In this study, we present observations from passive packet-level monitoring of more than 22,000 residential DSL lines from a major European ISP. This unique vantage point provides a broad view of residential traffic, enabling more comprehensive and detailed characterizations than previous studies. Our initial exploration focuses on a broad range of dominant characteristics, including DSL session characteristics, network and transport-level features, prominent applications, and network path dynamics.

We discovered several surprising results:
- HTTP traffic, not peer-to-peer, dominates, making up nearly 60% of traffic by bytes, while peer-to-peer contributes only about 14%.
- DSL sessions are short, with a median duration of 20–30 minutes, affecting IP address reassignments.
- Delays from a residence to the ISP’s Internet gateway often exceed those over the wide-area path.
- Users rarely employ the full capacity of their lines, with 802.11 wireless networking and TCP settings limiting achievable throughput.

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of our datasets and terminology. Sections 3 through 7 explore DSL session characteristics, popular applications, HTTP usage, transport protocol features, and path characteristics, respectively. We summarize our findings in Section 8.

## 2. Data and Terminology

Our study is based on passive, anonymized packet-level observations of residential DSL connections collected at aggregation points within a large European ISP. The ISP has approximately 10 million subscribers, predominantly using DSL. The monitor operated at the broadband access router connecting customers to the ISP’s backbone. Access bandwidth varies between 1,200/200 Kbps and 17,000/1,200 Kbps, depending on the customer’s contract and distance from the DSLAM.

For clarity, we define the following terms:
- **Line:** A physical DSL line identified by a line-card identifier.
- **DSL-Level Session:** The period when the DSL modem and the line-card are together in operation.
- **Local Side:** The network between the monitoring point and the customer.
- **Remote Side:** The remainder of the Internet.
- **Upstream Trafﬁc:** Data sent by the customer.
- **Downstream Trafﬁc:** Data received by the customer.
- **Flow:** Unidirectional data transmission at the 5-tuple granularity (IP addresses, transport protocol, transport ports).
- **Connection:** Bi-directional transport-level communication channel, demarked for TCP by control packets (SYN, FIN/RST) and for UDP by the arrival of the first packet and an idle timeout of 20 seconds.
- **Originator Endpoint:** The endpoint that actively initiated the connection.
- **Responder:** The endpoint that passively awaited the connection request.

We observed more than 20,000 DSL lines connected to one access router, using Endace DAG network monitoring cards for traffic capture. Immediately after capture, we extracted application classifications and HTTP headers using DPD and Bro, storing anonymized versions of the packet and application headers for later processing. Table 1 provides an overview of the data traces, including collection times and sizes.

In addition, we gathered anonymized DSL session information, including session start and end times, anonymized IP address, anonymized line-card identifier, and configured access-bandwidth. Along with DSL session traces for each packet measurement, we obtained a 10-day DSL session-only trace from January 2009 (TEN), as well as six separate 24-hour session-only traces (see Table 2).

To simplify the presentation, we focus on SEP and TEN, but we verified our results across all traces and explicitly noted any differences. We also cross-checked our results with sampled NetFlow data exported by 10 of the ISP’s routers, increasing our confidence in the representativeness of our application mix results.

## 3. DSL Session Characteristics

We begin our study by examining the behavior of users' DSL sessions. A fundamental question concerns the durations of these connections. Network analysis studies often assume that IP addresses can be used as host identifiers, but previous studies have found that these mappings are stable for several hours to days. Moore et al. analyzed the 2001 Code Red outbreak and found that for larger timescales (days to weeks), IP addresses cannot be used as reliable host identifiers due to IP reassignment. Xie et al. observed highly volatile dynamic IP address ranges, mainly attributed to dial-up hosts.

Thus, we expected to find typical session lengths of several hours. However, we found that many sessions are quite short. Our analysis is based on Radius logs, which many European ISPs use for authentication and IP address leasing. Radius supports two timeouts, SessionTimeout and IdleTimeout, though the monitored ISP only uses the first. SessionTimeout limits the maximum lifetime of a session, set to 24 hours. Home routers generally offer an option to reconnect immediately after a session expires, but unlike DHCP, Radius does not provide an option to request a specific IP address, and the ISP allows addresses to change across sessions.
