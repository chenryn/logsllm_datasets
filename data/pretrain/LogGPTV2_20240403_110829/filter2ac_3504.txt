### Title: Behind the Scenes of Intel's Converged Security and Manageability Engine (CSME) at Black Hat US 2019

**Abstract:**

In recent years, low-level firmware vulnerabilities have gained significant attention due to their high-privilege nature and the robust security measures implemented in modern operating systems. Intel has developed the Converged Security and Manageability Engine (CSME) to provide a critical security foundation for platforms, starting from the establishment of the "Root of Trust" concept. Over the past few years, continuous improvements have been made to the CSME firmware to address common memory corruption issues and reduce the complexity and privileges of certain CSME firmware modules, in response to previously disclosed security vulnerabilities.

In this presentation, we will delve into the following key areas:

1. **CSME Hardware Overview:**
   - Description of the hardware architecture.
   - Limitations and the security challenges it presents.

2. **CSME ÂµKernel OS Internals:**
   - Detailed explanation of the boot flow.
   - Overview of debugging capabilities.

3. **Processes and Key Features:**
   - Examination of the core processes and features of the CSME.

4. **Customization and OEM Role:**
   - How CSME supports customization.
   - The role of Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) in the manufacturing process.

5. **Recovery and Update Mechanisms:**
   - Explanation of the mechanisms for recovery and firmware updates.

6. **Exploitation Mitigations:**
   - Strategies for mitigating memory corruption vulnerabilities.
   - Implementation of defense-in-depth techniques.

7. **Fuzzing and Monitoring Technologies:**
   - Discussion on the use of fuzzers and monitoring technologies.
   - How feedback fuzzing and queue management can be applied in a generic form to any existing fuzzer.

We will also share deep technical insights into how the CSME firmware applies industry-standard mitigations tailored to the firmware environment. Additionally, we will provide guidance on how other firmware environments can achieve similar results by adopting the same technologies and methodologies.

This presentation aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the CSME and its role in enhancing platform security, as well as practical insights for developers and security professionals working with firmware.
