# Description of the new feature/enhancement
VTE only rewraps the contents of the (normal screen + its scrollback buffer)
on a resize event. It doesn't rewrap the contents of the alternate screen.
Rationale:
The alternate screen is used by applications which repaint it after a resize
event. So it doesn't really matter.
However, in that short time window, after resizing the terminal but before the
application catches up, this prevents vertical lines (e.g. the user interface
of `mc`) from becoming ugly tilted.
