User: newb here. I am trying to make a c++ program that will read from a named pipe created by python. My problem is, the named pipe created by python uses os.getpid() as part of the pipe name. when i try calling the pipe from c++, i use getpid(). i am not getting the same value from c++. is there a method equivalent in c++ for os.getpid?
thanks!
edit:
sorry, i am actually using os.getpid() to get the session id via ProcessIDtoSessionID(). i then use the session id as part of the pipe name
Assistant: You cannot easily retrieve the Python interpreter's PID from your C++ program.
Either assign the named pipe a constant name, or if you really need multiple pipes of the same Python program, create a temporary file to which the Python programs write their PIDs (use file locking!) - then you can read the PIDs from the C++ program.
