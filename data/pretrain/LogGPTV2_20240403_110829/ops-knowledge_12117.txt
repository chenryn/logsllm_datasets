User: I need to make VLC download then play songs.  I'm planning on using the os.popen to issue commands to the VLC command line (I'm having some problems getting the python binding working...).  My question is, is there any callback that I can get when VLC is done downloading so that I can know to start streaming?
Assistant: To close VLC after any actions append vlc://quit to your command line
