User: How to use the Linux command line for network testing, such as Ping and Traceroute, etc.?
Assistant: Network testing on the Linux command line usually uses two commands: ping and traceroute. The following is their usage: 1. Ping command The Ping command is used to test the reachability between hosts. The most commonly used option is the -c option, which specifies how many echo requests to send. For example, sending 4 echo requests would do this: ping -c 4 www.example.com The output will show the response time for each echo request, including min, max, and average time data. 2. Traceroute command The Traceroute command is used to trace the routers that data packets need to pass through from source to destination. Here is the usage of Traceroute: traceroute www.example.com The output will show each router and elapsed time data. You can use the -t option to specify the maximum number of hops. For example, to limit the number of hops to 5 do this: traceroute -t 5 www.example.com This will only show the first 5 routers.
