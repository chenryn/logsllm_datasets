**Abstract:**
An Internet hitlist is a set of addresses that represent the entire Internet. Hitlists have long been used in studies of Internet topology, reachability, and performance, serving as destinations for traceroute or performance probes. Early studies used manually generated lists of prominent addresses, but the evolution and growth of the Internet make human maintenance impractical. Random selection scales to today's address space, but most random addresses do not respond. In this paper, we present the first automatic generation of hitlists informed by censuses of Internet addresses. We formalize the desirable characteristics of a hitlist: responsiveness (each representative responds to pings), completeness (they cover all allocated IPv4 address space), and stability (list evolution is minimized when possible). We quantify the accuracy of our automatic hitlists, showing that only one-third of the Internet allows informed selection of representatives. Of informed representatives, 50–60% are likely to respond three months later, and non-responses are often due to dynamic addressing or firewalls. Despite these limitations, the use of informed hitlists can add 1.7 million edge links (a 5% growth) to traceroute-based Internet topology studies. Our hitlists are available free-of-charge and are in use by several other research projects.

## 1. Introduction
The smooth operation of the Internet is crucial for the global economy. Therefore, it is essential for Internet users, providers, and policymakers to understand its performance and robustness. While individuals may only care about their personal performance, a full diagnosis of "why is my web connection slow?" must consider not just the user's "first mile" connection but also the numerous servers that affect performance. Web content providers invest significant effort in optimizing page load times and building distributed content delivery networks. Policymakers debate questions about universal access, broadband availability, and the robustness of critical infrastructure.

To address these questions, researchers, operators, and industry have developed various tools to map the Internet, evaluate performance, and assess routing and reachability. Active probing, particularly with traceroute and ping, plays a crucial role in this process. While some studies focus on specific networks, we are interested in observing the entire Internet, which comprises over three billion allocated IPv4 addresses.

Studies of the entire Internet typically employ a hitlist—a list of IP addresses that can represent the billions of allocated addresses. The defining characteristic of a hitlist is completeness, where a representative is chosen for every allocated block of addresses defined by a /24 prefix. Representatives provide a 256-fold reduction in scanning size, allowing Internet-wide studies to be conducted in hours instead of months.

Although completeness is necessary, an ideal hitlist should also be responsive and stable. A responsive representative replies to ICMP messages, allowing traceroute to confirm a path to the edge of the network and ping to measure round-trip time. For longitudinal studies, the hitlist should be stable, with representative identities not changing frequently or arbitrarily.

While hitlists are easy to define and have been used in topology studies for many years, they are surprisingly difficult to create and maintain. Early hitlists were built manually from well-known sites, but the size of the Internet and the rate of churn in even well-known servers made manual maintenance untenable. More recent studies have used randomly chosen representatives, which, while statistically unbiased, sacrifice stability and responsiveness.

The contribution of this paper is to provide a new, automated method of hitlist generation that provides complete coverage while maximizing stability and responsiveness. Our hitlists are constructed by mining data from IP address censuses, complete, ping-based enumerations of the allocated IPv4 address space taken every two to three months.

We also evaluate our hitlists, finding that they are 100% complete as of when they are constructed. However, when we have no history (in about two-thirds of the blocks), we select representatives at random. We define the accuracy of our hitlists as the percentage of representatives that are responsive three months after the hitlist is taken. We find that two-thirds of the allocated address space never responds to ICMP probes, and of the remaining responsive Internet, our hitlists select representatives that are responsive about 55% of the time.

Finally, our work reveals insights into the nature of the Internet itself. Despite having complete input data, the responsiveness of our predicted representatives is not higher, suggesting an upper bound on responsiveness characterizing the portion of the Internet with high address churn. We also characterize the distribution of addresses in each block, showing that it strongly reflects address allocation patterns.

Our hitlists are available free-of-charge and are already being used by several research projects. We discuss the security and policy issues involved in sharing this data.

## 2. Related Work
Hitlists are used in active probing for studies of topology, performance, and reachability. Each of these studies uses some hitlist, sometimes called a seed or probe list, generated manually, randomly, or automatically from several sources.

Early topology work used manually generated lists. Skitter, a well-known measurement tool developed at CAIDA, uses traceroutes from multiple locations to a hitlist of destinations. Their target address list was manually built from various sources, including tcpdump from the UCSD–CERF link, hostnames from search engines, and intermediate addresses seen from their own trace records. By 2004, their hitlist had grown to 971,080 destinations. However, maintaining this list became labor-intensive, and responsiveness degraded over time. This led to a shift towards random probing with Archipelago.

Random representative selection allows low-cost generation of hitlists for larger numbers of networks. Mercator developed informed random probing to adaptively adjust its probe list based on prior results. Archipelago (Ark) is a measurement platform designed to support traceroute and other measurements, effectively a next-generation Skitter. Ark’s hitlist covers all routed /24 blocks, choosing a random last-octet within each /24 block. While these random hitlists are essential to cover the millions of /24 networks in today's Internet, they may sacrifice the responsiveness of the destination address. Our hitlist provides complete coverage while maximizing responsiveness.

DisCarte’s hitlist selects the .1 address in each /24 block of the routed address space, adding record route information to traceroute probing to obtain more accurate and complete network topologies. Our work confirms that the .1 address is responsive twice as often as the address with median responsiveness, but we suggest that census-informed representative selection can achieve even better responsiveness.

There has also been some work in IPv6 topology discovery. The Atlas system uses a manually generated list built from 6bone destinations, then expanded based on discoveries. Future work may involve comparing both active and passive hitlist generation approaches in the IPv4 space to infer coverage of passive studies of IPv6.

## 3. Methodology
We describe the requirements of an IP hitlist, how we transform census data using several prediction methods to get a good quality hitlist, and how our implementation copes with Internet-sized datasets.

### 3.1 Hitlist Requirements
Our goal is to provide representatives that are responsive, complete, and stable.

- **Responsive:** Each representative is likely to respond to an echo request with an echo reply instead of an ICMP error code. We select representatives that have responded frequently in the past, biasing our selection to favor recent results.
- **Complete:** We report one representative address for every allocated /24 block. Some groups have used other definitions of completeness, such as one representative per AS or per routed BGP block. We select one representative for each /24 block to decouple the hitlist from the routing system, allowing independent study of the routing system itself.
- **Stable:** Representatives do not change arbitrarily. We change representatives when a new representative would significantly improve the score for that block, typically because a representative has ceased to be reachable. Stability simplifies longitudinal studies and reduces the effects of transient routing outages or packet loss on the long-term hitlist.

The three goals of responsiveness, completeness, and stability can be in conflict. For example, completeness requires selecting representatives that may be non-responsive. To guarantee representatives for all allocated addresses, we select representatives even for blocks that have no recent responses or have never responded, annotating these representatives with distinguished scores.

### 3.2 Background: Internet Censuses
Our main goal with a hitlist is to predict the future: a representative should be responsive in the future. Our tool to make this prediction is data from past responses. Hitlist selection leverages Internet censuses that have been taken regularly since 2003. Each Internet census is the result of a ping (an ICMP ECHO REQUEST message) sent to every allocated IPv4 address. Censuses are far from perfect, as they must be taken carefully to avoid ICMP rate limiting or transient router errors, and firewalls reduce ping response rates by around 40%. However, firewall-limited censuses are ideal for hitlist generation.

It takes 2–3 months to carry out a full census. Table 1 shows the IPv4 censuses used in this paper.

### 3.3 Prediction Methods
We consider several prediction functions to select representatives that are likely to be responsive in the future. These methods include:

- **Frequency-Based Selection:** Selecting addresses that have responded most frequently in the past.
- **Recency-Based Selection:** Favoring addresses that have responded most recently.
- **Hybrid Methods:** Combining frequency and recency to balance responsiveness and stability.

We implement stability by applying inertia as a threshold to changing a previously selected representative. Currently, we switch representatives when the switch will improve the score significantly, with an inertia threshold of 0.34.

In the next section, we evaluate the degree to which informed hitlist generation may improve the number of links discovered in a topology study.
