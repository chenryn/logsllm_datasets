User: I recently have started learning python and have run into an issue.
When I run python on my mac without virtualenv, the version number is Python 2.7.5. Unfortunately, when I go into my virtualenv, and run Python, the version number is Python 2.6.1.
I tried, creating another virtualenv using:
virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python2.7 newdev
but got: The executable /usr/bin/python2.7 (from --python=/usr/bin/python2.7) does not exist
Assistant: virtualenv --python=python3 mynewenv
