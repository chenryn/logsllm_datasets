User: I've set up PyCharm, created my virtualenv (either through the virtual env command, or directly in PyCharm) and activated that environment as my Interpreter. Everything is working just fine.
However, if I open a terminal using "Tools, Open Terminal", the shell prompt supplied is not using the virtual env; I still have to use source ~/envs/someenv/bin/activate within that Terminal to activate it.
Another method is to activate the environment in a shell, and run PyCharm from that environment. This is "workable" but pretty ugly, and means I have major problems if I switch environments or projects from PyCharm: I'm now using the totally-wrong environment.
Is there some other, much-easier way to have "Tools, Open Terminal" automatically activate the virtual environment?
Assistant: Windows Simple and Easy Solution:

In Pycharm inside the Projects menu on the left there will be folders.
Find the Scripts folder
Inside there you'll find activate.bat
Right click on activate.bat
Copy/Path Reference
Select Absolute Path
Find the Terminal tab located in the middle at the bottom of Pycharm.
Paste it into the terminal console and press enter
If you did it right the terminal path will have brackets (venv) around the name of the folder you activated.
Before: "PS C:\"
After: "(venv) C:\"
Note The folder name may be different than yours the  important part is the (brackets) :D
