### 6.2 Comparison to Open DNS Resolvers

**Figure 10: Size of Vulnerable NTP and DNS Amplifier Pools**

This figure illustrates the relative size of vulnerable NTP and DNS amplifier pools over time, measured in weeks since the respective projects (OpenNTPProject.org and OpenResolverProject.org) began publicizing vulnerable server counts. The first three DNS samples and one outlier (due to collection and methodology issues) have been excluded from the analysis.

- **NTP Monlist Amplifiers**: The remediation of NTP monlist amplifiers has been significantly faster, with over 90% of vulnerable servers being remediated rapidly.
- **DNS Amplifiers**: In contrast, the pool of open DNS resolvers, which are also susceptible to amplification/reflection attacks, has not decreased much in relative terms.

A key difference is that open DNS resolvers are often found on customer premises equipment (CPE), which is more difficult to update or replace compared to infrastructure servers like those running NTP. The intersection between the NTP monlist amplifier IP pool and the open DNS recursive resolver pool is approximately 7K out of 107K monlist amplifiers in the latest sample. Over 15 ONP samples, the overlap is 199K unique IPs, representing 9.2% of the total. These poorly managed IPs may remain vulnerable for some time due to the difficulty in updating CPE and the prevalence of mismanaged networks.

### 6.3 The Effect of Remediation

The significant reduction in NTP amplifiers is also evident in the number of amplifiers per victim IP, which has decreased by an order of magnitude across the ONP samples. However, the average number of packets sent by each remaining amplifier has increased by about an order of magnitude, compensating for the reduced number of amplifiers. This means that the remaining amplifiers are being used more intensively.

- **Victim Traffic**: As shown in Figure 6, the average number of packets a victim sees has decreased from 10M in January to 1M starting in mid-February, and the median has decreased to about a third.
- **Alternative NTP Commands**: Other NTP commands may be used by attackers as the pool of monlist amplifiers decreases. The version command amplifier pool, for example, has only decreased by 19% since its peak.

Since our victim and attack counts are derived from parsing monlist tables, our view of the global NTP population is reduced when the command is blocked or patched, leading to fewer observed victims, attacks, and packets. Therefore, our estimates represent a lower bound. Additionally, a small number of highly effective amplifiers, if exploited by more attackers, could increase the overall attack traffic seen by victims.

### 6.4 Operator Motivation and Notification

The rapid remediation of NTP monlist amplifiers may be attributed to an aggressive notification effort conducted via CERTs and direct operator contact, as reported by KÃ¼hrer et al. [20]. While it is plausible that this communication had a significant impact, causality cannot be definitively determined. Discussions with DDoS experts at Arbor Networks and a global ISP operator suggest that the motivation to remediate was likely driven by the large impact of this traffic on operators' own networks.

Understanding the reasons and mechanisms behind the dramatic reduction in the NTP monlist population was beyond the scope of this study, but these two possible causes highlight the importance of understanding what encourages beneficial operator responses to global Internet threats. Clearly, remediation and mitigation of amplifiers have positive externalities, benefiting both the operator's network and the broader Internet security.

### 7. A View from Regional Networks

In the previous sections, we focused on the global perspective of the NTP DDoS phenomenon. We now turn our attention to how these events appeared at individual networks and the commonalities between them.

#### 7.1 Local Impacts

We examined two local views: Merit Network and Front Range Gigapop (FRGP). Merit is a large regional ISP serving multiple educational and non-profit institutions in Michigan, while FRGP serves Colorado State University (CSU).

- **Merit Network**: On a normal day, NTP traffic is negligible. The NTP attacks became visible in the third week of December 2013, with peaks exceeding 200MB/sec.
- **FRGP/CSU**: The first signs of NTP attacks were observed almost a month later, with attack volumes an order of magnitude less than at Merit. CSU secured their NTP servers on January 24th, 2014, returning traffic to pre-attack levels. However, other networks within FRGP were less proactive, and vulnerable NTP servers continued to launch attacks throughout February.

#### 7.2 Individual Attacker/Victim Activity

Our datasets from these two sites offer detailed insights into the activity of individual attackers and victims, validating our global datasets. For example, we identified 291 common targets attacked by amplifiers at both Merit and FRGP. The attack volume to these common targets is illustrated in Figure 15.

- **Remediation Efforts**: At Merit, trouble tickets and customer notifications were used to track and encourage prompt patching. During the early stages, Merit also implemented traffic rate limits to minimize the impact on customers. At CSU, patching was completed within a single day, though remediation in the rest of FRGP is ongoing.

These detailed analyses provide a comprehensive understanding of the NTP DDoS phenomenon at both global and local levels, highlighting the importance of coordinated efforts in mitigating such threats.
