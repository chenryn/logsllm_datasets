Challenge Target the Children of an Element Using jQuery has an issue.

Please describe how to reproduce this issue, and include links to screenshots
if possible.
  * As soon as the Challenge loads, button with ID target5 is duplicated in the left-well  
https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0-LhUhPNlwlYnRMa2g0TEhSVFU/view?usp=sharing
(Clicking on the link above does not seem to work, however highlighting the
link text, right-clicking and selecting go to https://drive.goo....... does
work, or just copy and paste the link in a new Tab)
  * Making any unrelated change in the code, updates the output properly and removes the duplicate target, even if you then remove the change that was made to force the output to update.
Default Code:
      jQuery Playground
          #left-well
            #target1
            #target2
            #target3
          #right-well
            #target4
            #target5
            #target6
