User: is it possible to check if a file is done copying of if its complete using python?
or even on the command line.
i manipulate files programmatically in a specific folder on mac osx but i need to check if the file is complete before running the code which makes the manipulation.
Assistant: It seems like you have control of the (python?) program doing the copying. What commands are you using to copy? I would think writing your code such that it blocks until the copy operation is complete would be sufficient.
Is this program multi-threaded or processed? If so you could add file paths to a queue when they are complete and then have the other thread only act on items in the queue.
