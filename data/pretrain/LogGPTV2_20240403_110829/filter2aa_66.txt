Frontpage: Laying the ground work
What is it?
● Microsoft's integrated Web Site development 
tool. 
● System for adding basic to advanced 
functionality with little or no web page 
experience.
● Integrated MS Office package
● Security Nightmare
Who is Vermeer Technologies?
● In early 1995, Vermeer Technologies developed one of 
the first web publishing tools for simple end users, 
Frontpage. 
● Following enormous success, the application was later 
bought out by Microsoft and integrated in the Office 
package.
Frontpage: Decoding the system
Protocol Analysis
Client/Server Protocol Analysis
● Communication between Client and Server.
● Frontpage Client and Server extensions communicate 
over HTTP PUT requests. The Frontpage client makes 
requests against Author.dll, Admin.dll, and shtml.exe.
Author.dll(exe)
Authoring commands, uploading, downloading 
content, reviewing properties, adding 
enhancements.
Admin.dll(exe)
Admin commands, including adding additional 
users, modify user permissions, listing 
accounts.
Shtml.exe, vti_rpc
Initial access and service negotiation.
The Authentication System
•This authentication 
process takes place each 
time a request is 
performed, i.e login, 
upload, download, change 
permissions, navigate 
folders, etc. 
•While an ineffective use of 
resources, it does limit 
attacks based on state.
_vti_inf.html
● _vti_inf.html
– This file provides configuration information and 
helps us determine something about the server.
_vti_inf.html Cont.
● Using the following simple guidelines when 
reading the _vti_inf.html file we can better 
determine the operating system.
● _vti_inf.html files with references to 
.exe tools most likely reside on Unix 
servers.
● _vti_inf.html files with references to 
.dll tools most likely reside on 
Windows Servers
● Server extension version numbers 
can further help us narrow down the 
options.
_vti_inf Version Table
● Using the information in _vti_inf.html, we can 
often correctly determine the OS version.
Operating System/Version
Frontpage Extension Version
Windows 98/ME Personal Webserver
?
Windows NT 4.0
4.x
Windows 2000
5.x
Windows XP

Understanding Vermeer RPC Packets
● All responses from Frontpage Server 
Extensions come in the form of Vermeer 
RPC Packets. 
● Vermeer Packets closely resemble HTML 
pages.
Information is coded within 
these packets based on 
position within HTML tags.
An early precursor to XML? 
Sample Vermeer RPC Packet
● The following sample VTI Packet contains 
large amounts of information, including 
physical drive locations.
– Physical drive paths may be useful for Unicode exploits.
Frontpage: Knocking on the door
Custom Tools 
fpxploiter -> Frontpage Vulnerability Scanner
Perl-Gtk Scanning tool
Summary
● Now that we have a better understanding of how 
Frontpage works, let's see about finding vulnerable 
targets.
● This is what brought about fpxploiter.
It's a Perl-Gtk application the 
provides capability for:
• Locating Frontpage accessible 
webservers, using default options, or 
user defined accounts and 
passwords.
• Servers without passwords
• Servers with weak passwords
Using fpxploiter: How to Start
● Start fpxploiter with the command fpxploiter.
● Application opens with main window.
Using fpxploiter: How the scanner 
works?
● Start by providing a target list, the current configuration 
of the tool does not allow scanning of more than one 
Class C at a time.
● Select File->Set Targets or press Ctrl-T.
● Enter the host targets.
Using fpxploiter: How modify the 
password list?
● Select File->Set Password List and select you new 
password list file.
Using fpxploiter: How modify the 
default user account?
● Select File->Set User account and enter your new user 
account.
Using fpxploiter: How to export the 
results?
● Select File->Save Log and select the destination for 
your log file, use this AFTER the scanning is complete.
Additional Screen Captures
● Fpxploiter during a scanning session.
Future Directions
● Support for Apache Frontpage extensions.
● Redesign of the fpxploiter tool to provide 
generic Frontpage access library.
● Rebuild in C/Gtk or C++/QT.
● Support for uploading content.
Code
● All Code for fpxploiter is available the the 
following website.
– http://www.fpxploiter.org
● Additionally it's on the DEFCON CD.
Frontpage: What to do when your there
ASP for Hackers
SQL Server Database Hunting
● SQL Server Database Access Tools
● Custom ASP pages that allow us to execute 
queries and explore SQL Servers.
● Using fpxploiter to locate vulnerable servers.
Tie it all together with ASP 
pages to execute sql 
queries against the 
database.
Summary
● Fpxploiter helps us find vulnerable web 
servers.
● SQLUltimate.asp contains custom asp code that 
functions as a SQL Analyzer.
– Ideas?
Add SQL Server users (if your in 
the System Admin role)
Access corporate data
Execute extended stored 
procedures
Locate application accounts and 
passwords
Screen Capture
● The following screen capture shows the 
SQLUltimate.asp and a resulting query 
result.

Summary
● Fpxploiter helps us find vulnerable web 
servers.
● cmdasp.asp contains custom asp code to execute 
simple console commands.
– Ideas?
Use netstat -an & netstat -a as 
make shift reverse DNS.
Use net localgroup and net view 
to understand drive mappings 
and groups.
Use ping to find additional 
servers

cmdasp.asp in action.

Future Ideas
● ASP Code can be used in conjunction with 
the winsock control to provide “scanning” 
from the webserver.
● ASP Code can be used to view 
SMB Shares and Remote 
Administration (See 
http://cifs.novotny.org/,  
amazing work with ASP.NET)
● ASP Code can be used with 
xmlhttp controls to navigate 
internal web sites (Intranets)
Frontpage: Holding down the fort
Securing Frontpage through best practices
Strong Passwords
● As in most systems, your last line of defense 
is your password, and Frontpage is no 
different. 
Choose strong passwords, 
consisting of upper and lowercase 
characters (with LANMAN this is
rather meaningless), numbers, 
and special characters.
Stick with passwords over eight 
characters in length.
Changed Admin Account
● As is good practice, consider changing the 
name of your Administrator account.
● Choose something meaningful, however 
avoid the typical choices, such as:
– Root
– Admin
– 123
– Password
Concept of least privilege
● Only provide the access necessary to get the 
job done.
Use the Frontpage roles to assign 
users Author rights to specific 
webs as appropriate.
Reserve Admin rights for specific 
accounts.
IP Restrictions
● Using IIS native IP based restrictions you can 
effectively block a large portion of Frontpage attacks.
●
Use the IIS Access tab to block access to the admin.dll and 
author.dll to IP addresses outside of your internal range.
●
Additionally, 
consider 
segmenting 
your 
developers 
and giving 
this group 
access only.
