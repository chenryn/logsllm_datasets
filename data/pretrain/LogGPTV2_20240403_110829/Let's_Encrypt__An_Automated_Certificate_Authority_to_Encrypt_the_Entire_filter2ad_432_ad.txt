implement means of satisfying ACME challenges. Certbot provides
authenticators for solving HTTP challenges with or without an
existing HTTP service, as well as for solving DNS challenges with
common DNS providers such as Amazon Route 53. Installer plugins
configure a service to use a newly obtained certificate and can mod-
ify configurations for improved security. Current installers support
Apache, Nginx, HAProxy, and other services.
Working with server configuration files has been one of the
most difficult challenges for Certbot. Neither Apache nor Nginx

Table 2: Most popular ACME clients. There is a rich ecosystem of ACME
clients. Here we show the clients that requested the most certificates in De-
cember 2018 and January 2019, based on data from Let’s Encrypt logs. Some
clients that are integrated with large hosting providers (e.g., Squarespace)
tend to issue many certificates from a small number of IP addresses.
offers an API to access its configuration, and their configuration
languages are not well specified. To reduce the chance of breaking
the server’s configuration, Certbot runs automated checks and will
revert any modifications if a test fails. Unfortunately, this cannot
guarantee that all changes have the intended effects. We encourage
server developers to provide APIs that allow external services to
modify their configurations, publish a formal specification for their
configuration languages, and provide secure defaults that do not
require correction by third-party tools.
6.2 Servers with Automatic Provisioning
Several Web servers can automatically provision Let’s Encrypt cer-
tificates. One of the first was Caddy [67], a Go-based Web server
with an integrated ACME client that provisions and renews cer-
tificates without user interaction. Servers running Caddy exhibit
nearly ubiquitous HTTPS deployment and use of modern TLS con-
figurations, although they account for only a small fraction of Let’s
Encrypt certificates. We hope to see other popular server software
follow Caddy’s lead. The Apache project’s mod_md provides similar
functionality [15], although it has yet to see significant adoption.
Web control panels, which help administrators configure servers,
have also added ACME support, including cPanel [101], Plesk [76],
and Webmin [102]. These integrations are frequently deployed by
hosting providers and help drive HTTPS adoption for smaller sites.
They account for a huge portion of Let’s Encrypt usage. About half
of domains with a Let’s Encrypt certificate and 18% of Let’s Encrypt
certificates are issued using the cPanel plugin alone.
6.3 Hosting Providers
Prior to Let’s Encrypt, a disproportionate number of sites without
HTTPS were small sites, a significant number of which were served
by shared hosting providers that controlled all aspects of HTTPS
configuration (see Section 7). Often, these services provided no
means for enabling HTTPS or required customers to upload their
own certificates—an approach that was problematic for the techni-
cally unsophisticated users that such providers tend to attract.
Let’s Encrypt has enabled a number of very large providers to
automatically provision HTTPS for all of their sites without any
user interaction. Around 200 hosting providers, including Squares-
pace [90], WordPress [8], OVH [74], and Google, now have built-
in Let’s Encrypt provisioning. As we discuss in Section 7, more
than half of publicly accessible Let’s Encrypt certificates are hosted
by these providers. While most individual sites hosted by these
providers see only relatively little traffic, an avenue for migrating
them to HTTPS with little or no user interaction is necessary to
transition the entire Web to HTTPS.
6.4 Embedded Devices
A growing number of embedded devices include ACME clients,
including products from Asus, D-Link, Synology, and Zyxel. AVM
GmbH’s Fritz!Box residential gateway [18] illustrates a typical im-
plementation. Devices are assigned a subdomain of myfritz.net,
which acts as a dynamic DNS provider, requests a certificate from
Let’s Encrypt, and allows users to administer the device without
needing to bypass any browser warnings. Such devices are only
responsible for a small fraction of Let’s Encrypt certificates.

(b) Let’s Encrypt growth
Figure 4: CA market share and Let’s Encrypt’s growth for Alexa Top Million domains. Since Let’s Encrypt launched, it has seen more growth among
top million sites than any other CA. It was used by about 35% of top million sites with HTTPS as of January 2019.
7 LET’S ENCRYPT’S USAGE AND IMPACT
Since its launch in December 2015, Let’s Encrypt has steadily grown
to become the largest CA in the Web PKI by certificates issued and
the fourth largest known CA by Firefox Beta TLS full handshakes.
As of January 21, 2019, the CA had issued a total of 538M cer-
tificates for 223M unique FQDNs, and there were 91M unexpired
Let’s Encrypt certificates valid for 155M unique FQDNs. This repre-
sents more unique certificates than all other CAs combined. (Except
where otherwise noted, analysis in this section is based on data
from that date. For Certificate Transparency data, we count cer-
tificates by the SHA-256 hash of the tbsCertificate structure
after removing CT poison and SCTs to prevent double counting
pre-certificates and certificates.) In this section, we analyze Let’s
Encrypt’s role in the HTTPS ecosystem from a variety of perspec-
tives including longitudinal Censys HTTPS scans [35], Certificate
Transparency (CT) logs [62], Firefox client telemetry, and our own
HTTPS scans of names in CT logs.
7.1 Adoption By Popular Websites
Let’s Encrypt is more commonly used by the long tail of sites on
the Web than by the most popular sites. Indeed, while the majority
of HTTPS sites use Let’s Encrypt, until recently no sites in the
Alexa Top 100 used a Let’s Encrypt certificate. The CA’s market
share increases as site popularity decreases: 5% of the top 1K, 20%
of the top 100K, and 35% of the top 1M sites with HTTPS use Let’s
Encrypt. Only 3.6% of full TLS handshakes by Firefox Beta users
are protected by Let’s Encrypt certificates. Instead, trust anchors
belonging to DigiCert and GlobalSign—the two CAs that have tran-
sitively issued certificates for the ten most popular sites by Alexa
rank—authenticate the majority of connections (Figure 5).
One likely reason that popular sites prefer other CAs is demand
for Organization Validation (OV) and Extended Validation (EV)
certificates, which Let’s Encrypt does not issue. Over 83% of sites
in the Top 100 use OV or EV certificates, while only 18% of all
trusted certificates are EV or OV validated. Given Firefox, Chrome,
and Safari’s moves to remove unique indicators for each validation
level [53, 73, 94, 96], more sites may move to DV certificates. Stack
Figure 5: Firefox HTTPS connections by trust anchor. We show the
trust anchors responsible for authenticating full TLS handshakes by Firefox
Beta users. Let’s Encrypt has become the fourth largest known CA.
Overflow (Alexa Rank 38) began using a Let’s Encrypt certificate
in July 2019, after our primary analysis was complete.
Let’s Encrypt has seen rapidly growing adoption among top
million sites since its launch, while most other CAs have not (Fig-
ure 4b). It was the fastest growing CA for those sites, increasing in
market share from just 2% in July 2016 to over 25% in January 2019
(Figure 4a). By contrast, the market share of Sectigo—the second
most popular CA within the top million sites—remained relatively
steady, at 17%. The only other major CA that showed significant
growth during this period is DigiCert, which grew from 2% to 10%.
Firefox Beta channel telemetry shows Let’s Encrypt increasing from
0.44% of full handshakes in the first 28 days of March 2017 to 3.7%
in the 28 days ending September 17, 2019 (Figure 5).
Most sites that have adopted Let’s Encrypt are new to HTTPS, but
many of the most popular sites that use the Let’s Encrypt previously
deployed HTTPS with a different CA. Of the 94K sites consistently
in the Alexa Top Million between 2015 and 2019 that now use a

public CT logs and based on domains responding to HTTPS requests. Let’s
Encrypt has issued more certificates and is served on more unique domains
than all other CAs combined.
Figure 6: CDF of ASes and eTLDs for Let’s Encrypt certificates. While
a large number of providers automatically provision certificates using Let’s
Encrypt, certificates from the CA are only somewhat more concentrated
(i.e., located in a small number of ASes) than those from other authorities.
