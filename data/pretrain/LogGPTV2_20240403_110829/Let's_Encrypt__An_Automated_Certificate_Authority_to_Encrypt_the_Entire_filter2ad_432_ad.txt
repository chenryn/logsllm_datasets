### Implementing ACME Challenges with Certbot

Certbot is a versatile tool that facilitates the process of obtaining and renewing SSL/TLS certificates by solving ACME (Automated Certificate Management Environment) challenges. It supports several methods to satisfy these challenges, including:

- **HTTP Challenges**: Certbot can handle HTTP challenges both with and without an existing HTTP service.
- **DNS Challenges**: It supports DNS challenges for popular DNS providers such as Amazon Route 53.

Additionally, Certbot includes installer plugins that configure web servers to use newly obtained certificates. These plugins can also modify server configurations to enhance security. Currently, Certbot supports the following services:
- Apache
- Nginx
- HAProxy
- Other web services

### Challenges in Server Configuration

One of the most significant challenges Certbot faces is working with server configuration files. Neither Apache nor Nginx provides a robust API for accessing and modifying their configurations, and their configuration languages are not well-documented. To mitigate the risk of breaking server configurations, Certbot performs automated checks and reverts any changes if a test fails. However, this does not guarantee that all modifications will have the intended effects. We encourage server developers to provide APIs for external services to modify configurations, publish formal specifications for their configuration languages, and offer secure defaults that do not require third-party tools for correction.

### Servers with Automatic Provisioning

Several web servers now support automatic provisioning of Let's Encrypt certificates. One of the earliest adopters was Caddy, a Go-based web server with an integrated ACME client that automatically provisions and renews certificates without user interaction. Servers running Caddy exhibit near-universal HTTPS deployment and use modern TLS configurations, although they account for only a small fraction of Let's Encrypt certificates. The Apache project's `mod_md` module offers similar functionality, though it has yet to see widespread adoption.

Web control panels, which assist administrators in configuring servers, have also added ACME support. Examples include cPanel, Plesk, and Webmin. These integrations are frequently deployed by hosting providers and significantly contribute to the adoption of HTTPS for smaller sites. About half of the domains with Let's Encrypt certificates and 18% of all Let's Encrypt certificates are issued using the cPanel plugin alone.

### Hosting Providers

Before Let's Encrypt, many small sites, often hosted by shared hosting providers, lacked HTTPS. These providers typically controlled all aspects of HTTPS configuration and either provided no means for enabling HTTPS or required customers to upload their own certificates, which was challenging for less technically savvy users.

Let's Encrypt has enabled a number of large hosting providers to automatically provision HTTPS for all their sites without user interaction. Around 200 hosting providers, including Squarespace, WordPress, OVH, and Google, now have built-in Let's Encrypt provisioning. More than half of publicly accessible Let's Encrypt certificates are hosted by these providers. While individual sites hosted by these providers may see relatively little traffic, the ability to migrate them to HTTPS with minimal user interaction is crucial for transitioning the entire web to HTTPS.

### Embedded Devices

A growing number of embedded devices, such as those from Asus, D-Link, Synology, and Zyxel, include ACME clients. AVM GmbHâ€™s Fritz!Box residential gateway is a typical example. These devices are assigned a subdomain of `myfritz.net`, which acts as a dynamic DNS provider, requests a certificate from Let's Encrypt, and allows users to administer the device without encountering browser warnings. However, such devices account for only a small fraction of Let's Encrypt certificates.

### Let's Encrypt Usage and Impact

Since its launch in December 2015, Let's Encrypt has grown to become the largest CA in the Web PKI by the number of certificates issued and the fourth-largest known CA by Firefox Beta TLS full handshakes. As of January 21, 2019, Let's Encrypt had issued a total of 538 million certificates for 223 million unique FQDNs, with 91 million unexpired certificates valid for 155 million unique FQDNs. This represents more unique certificates than all other CAs combined.

#### Adoption by Popular Websites

Let's Encrypt is more commonly used by the "long tail" of websites rather than the most popular ones. While the majority of HTTPS sites use Let's Encrypt, until recently, no sites in the Alexa Top 100 used a Let's Encrypt certificate. The CA's market share increases as site popularity decreases: 5% of the top 1K, 20% of the top 100K, and 35% of the top 1M sites with HTTPS use Let's Encrypt. Only 3.6% of full TLS handshakes by Firefox Beta users are protected by Let's Encrypt certificates. Trust anchors belonging to DigiCert and GlobalSign, which have issued certificates for the ten most popular sites by Alexa rank, authenticate the majority of connections.

One reason popular sites prefer other CAs is the demand for Organization Validation (OV) and Extended Validation (EV) certificates, which Let's Encrypt does not issue. Over 83% of sites in the Top 100 use OV or EV certificates, while only 18% of all trusted certificates are EV or OV validated. Given recent moves by Firefox, Chrome, and Safari to remove unique indicators for each validation level, more sites may move to Domain Validation (DV) certificates. Stack Overflow (Alexa Rank 38) began using a Let's Encrypt certificate in July 2019, after our primary analysis was complete.

Let's Encrypt has seen rapid adoption among top million sites since its launch, while most other CAs have not. It was the fastest-growing CA for these sites, increasing in market share from 2% in July 2016 to over 25% in January 2019. By contrast, the market share of Sectigo, the second most popular CA within the top million sites, remained relatively steady at 17%. The only other major CA that showed significant growth during this period was DigiCert, which grew from 2% to 10%.

Firefox Beta channel telemetry shows Let's Encrypt increasing from 0.44% of full handshakes in the first 28 days of March 2017 to 3.7% in the 28 days ending September 17, 2019.

Most sites that have adopted Let's Encrypt are new to HTTPS, but many of the most popular sites that now use Let's Encrypt previously deployed HTTPS with a different CA. Of the 94,000 sites consistently in the Alexa Top Million between 2015 and 2019 that now use Let's Encrypt, many were already using HTTPS with another CA.

### Most Popular Certificate Authorities

Based on data from public CT logs and domains responding to HTTPS requests, Let's Encrypt has issued more certificates and is served on more unique domains than all other CAs combined.

| Authority | Active FQDNs | Certificates |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| Let's Encrypt | 123.6M (58%) | 91.3M (57%) |
| cPanel | 45.4M (21%) | 15.8M (10%) |
| Sectigo (previously Comodo) | 14.9M (7%) | 10.0M (7%) |
| DigiCert | 8.7M (4%) | 7.1M (4%) |
| Cloudflare | 16.1M (10%) | 4.8M (3%) |
| GoDaddy | 7.4M (2%) | 1.0M (0.6%) |
| GlobalSign | 4.2M (2%) | 0.9M (0.5%) |
| Nazwa.pl | 1.9M (0.9%) | 1.5M (1%) |
| Amazon | 1.0M (0.5%) | 0.3M (0.2%) |
| Starfield | 0.9M (0.4%) | 0.9M (0.6%) |
| TrustAsia | 0.9M (0.4%) | 0.9M (0.6%) |
| Other | 3.6M (1.7%) | 11.3M (7.0%) |
| **Total** | **213M** | **161M** |

### Concentration of Let's Encrypt Certificates

While a large number of providers automatically provision certificates using Let's Encrypt, the distribution of these certificates is only somewhat more concentrated (i.e., located in a small number of ASes) than those from other authorities.

| Provider | LE % | LE % of LE Provider |
|----------|------|---------------------|
| Unified Layer | 33.8M | 91% |
| OVH | 5.1M | 60% |
| Amazon | 4.9M | 97% |
| Squarespace | 4.3M | 96% |
| Automattic | 3.9M | 85% |

This data highlights the significant role Let's Encrypt plays in the broader HTTPS ecosystem, particularly in driving the adoption of secure web practices across a wide range of websites and services.
