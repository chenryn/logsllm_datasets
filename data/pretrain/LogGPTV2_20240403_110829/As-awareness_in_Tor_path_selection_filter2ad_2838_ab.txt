et al.’s AS path inference algorithm [9]. Their approach per-
forms a Floyd-Warshall-like all-pairs “shortest policy paths”
computation on the graph G. The result of the algorithm is
the shortest paths between all pairs of ASes that satisfy the
valley-free property.
Note that known routing information is only used for con-
structing the AS-level topology and inferring relationships.
Mao et al.’s algorithm does not use known AS paths for
subsequently inferring the path between two ASes. Qiu in-
stead proposed an improved AS path inference algorithm
that takes advantage of known AS paths resulting in greater
inference accuracy [18]. Known AS paths contained in the
routing tables are considered “sure” paths. The ASes with
sure paths are called “base” ASes. From the known AS
paths, we can also derive other sure paths not explicitly
contained in the routing table. For example, consider the
known route Rk = {vkvk−1 . . . v1p}, where vi is an AS and
We ﬁrst examined if the more accurate inference algorithm
would aﬀect Feamster and Dingledine’s previous analysis of
the Tor network’s location diversity as it stood in mid-2004.
We repeated their experiment using the same list of sender
ASes, destination ASes and Tor relays as described in [5].
The only factor that changed was the use of Qiu’s more
accurate inference algorithm with more comprehensive input
routing table data.
The median location independence using the original al-
gorithm was 0.14 in the forward direction and 0.12 in the re-
verse direction for the sources and destinations given in these
tables with the Tor network as it existed at the time. Using
the improved algorithm and making no other changes these
jump to 0.21 and 0.25 respectively. Overall, a single AS was
able to observe either the forward or reverse paths (or both)
for 39.4% of the randomly generated circuits–greater than
the 10-30% suggested by Feamster and Dingledine. Our re-
sults indicate that the problem of an AS-level adversary ob-
serving both ends of a connection through the Tor network
in 2004 was thus moderately greater than originally thought.
Though understanding path inference is important to un-
derstanding our work, and developments purely based on
path inference do appear to have a modest impact, our pri-
mary focus is elsewhere: determining what the actual distri-
bution is for source and destination ASes of Tor traﬃc, ex-
amining the eﬀect of Tor’s tremendous network growth on lo-
cation independence, and similarly for its path-selection al-
gorithm (which signiﬁcantly deviates from uniform-at-random
for various reasons), and ﬁnally, considering novel AS-aware
path selection algorithms. It is these questions that we will
explore further in the remainder of this paper.
4. SENDER AND RECIPIENT ASES
The senders and recipients used in [5] and [15] were based
purely on conjecture. We conducted a real-world study to
better understand the true distribution of client origin ASes
and destination ASes in the Tor network. We present the
results of the study in this section, which were also used for
our experimentation described in Sections 5 and 6.
4.1 Data Collection
We ran two Tor nodes on the network of Rensselaer Poly-
technic Institute for a period of one week in early September
2008. The ﬁrst one ran with the default Tor exit policy that
blocks a few ports associated with SMTP, ﬁle sharing, etc.
but otherwise allows traﬃc to exit the Tor network from it.
For collecting statistics on client origin ASes, it is important
to note that modern Tor clients will only choose relatively
long-running and high-bandwidth nodes designated with a
special Guard ﬂag by the authoritative directory servers as
the ﬁrst relay in their circuit. Tor clients also tend to choose
non-exit relays as the ﬁrst hop, in order to preserve the some-
what limited available exit node bandwidth. For this reason,
the second node did not allow any exiting connections. We
also had to wait until the non-exit node attained the Guard
ﬂag before commencing our actual measurements.
We aggregated the number of connections per AS of clients
entering the guard node, as well as the number of connec-
tions per destination AS for clients exiting from our exit
node. The top ﬁfteen client origin ASes and destination
ASes are listed in Table 1. We will discuss our results
presently, but we ﬁrst comment a bit on our data collection
method.
Figure 1: The topology represented above is con-
structed from three known paths: {1, 2, 3}, {2, 4, 5}
and {3, 4, 5}. The edge labels indicate the frequency
index for each path and sub-path. As we can see,
the sub-path {4, 5} appears twice in the known AS
paths and thus has a frequency index of 2. The bold
line indicates an extended path {1, 2, 4, 5} obtained
by extending path {2, 4, 5} by one hop. The result-
ing path has an uncertain length of 1.
p is a destination preﬁx. Based on the propagation of route
updates via BGP, we know that Rk is derived from the best
path Rk−1 = {vk−1, . . . v1p} from AS vk−1 to preﬁx p. Thus,
from Rk, we can extract (k − 1) sure paths from a known
path of length k.
Since path segments may appear multiple times in both
the known AS paths and the derived sure paths, the al-
gorithm maintains a frequency index for each path. The
intuition is that paths and sub-paths appearing many times
in known AS paths should be preferred in inferred AS paths
over those appearing less frequently. Qiu’s algorithm infers
paths from a source AS to a destination preﬁx that are not
contained in the set of sure paths by extending a sure path
to adjacent ASes one hop at a time. If the extended path is
valley-free, it is added to the routing table. An example of
inferring an extended path from one or more sure paths is
given in Figure 1. The number of hops a path is extended
from a known sure path is called its uncertain length. When
there are multiple possible extended paths, the algorithm
favors inferred paths that have a shorter uncertain length,
higher frequency, and shorter overall length.
Qiu showed that an inference algorithm that exploits known
AS path information results in a 25% to 27% improvement
over Mao et al.’s in terms of inferring precisely the actual
route between a source AS and destination preﬁx.
3.2 Implementation
We developed a multithreaded implementation of Qiu’s
AS path inference algorithm in C. Full details on Qiu’s AS
path inference algorithm can be found in [18]. For infer-
ring relationships between ASes, we use Gao’s relationship
inference algorithm [6].
For input to the algorithm we used RIBs collected by
the University of Oregon’s RouteViews project [16]. The
RouteViews project peers with various ASes and periodi-
cally archives routing table dumps and BGP updates. The
particular dumps we use throughout the remainder of this
paper are RIBs from the OIX, Equinix, PAIX, KIXP, LINX
and DIXIE IXes. These routing tables combined represent
around 278,000 preﬁxes, 15.7 million paths, 29,000 ASes and
132,000 edges.

Table 1: Top 15 Tor client origin and destination ASes observed during a one week period in September
2008. For both origin and destination, less than two percent of the ASes recorded accounted for over half of
the connections.
Obviously client privacy is a signiﬁcant concern, especially
for users of the Tor network. Several factors help prevent
anyone, including ourselves from learning anything about
individual behavior from the data we gathered and present.
First, note that the current Tor route-selection policy will
not allow circuits containing entry and exit nodes from the
same /16 subnet of IP space. Since our two nodes ran from
the same IP address it would not be possible to end-to-end
correlate any connections using just these two nodes, even if
we had collected suﬃcient data, which we did not. This also
means that for any circuit for which we recorded an origin
AS, we were technically unable to collect the corresponding
destination AS or vice versa. Second, we only used the IP
address (origin or destination), nothing else about a given
connection such as its time, duration, protocol (for destina-
tion connections), number of bytes transmitted, etc. Third,
we used IP address only to determine AS. The IP address
itself was not recorded. Fourth, we recorded only the aggre-
gate totals for origination ASes and destination ASes rather
than an ordered list of those ASes. Thus we did not record
even the order of ASes relative to each other.
4.2 Results
We found 2251 distinct ASes for 20638 client connections.
Of these, more than half of the ASes produced only a single
connection and 85% produced fewer than ten connections.
Nearly 43% percent of the connections came from the top
twenty ﬁve observed client ASes–that is, just over one per-
cent of all observed client ASes. Thus a relatively small
percentage of ASes were responsible for the vast majority
of the client traﬃc. Similarly there were 4203 destination
ASes recorded during that week for 116781 destination con-
nections. Of these, 34% had only a single connection and
72% had fewer than ten connections. For both origin and
destination, less than two percent of the ASes recorded ac-
counted for over half of the connections.
Perhaps the most signiﬁcant observation from these num-
bers is that AS-level adversaries are a major unavoidable
threat to a large percentage of current Tor usage no matter
how route selection might be changed to take into account
AS path from clients to entry nodes and from exit nodes to
destinations. Controlling a small number of ASes will per-
mit end-to-end correlation on many connections regardless
of where the Tor nodes are placed. For example, AS 4134
(ChinaNet) is the number two AS for originating clients and
the number one AS for destinations. Without even con-
sidering cooperative or business relations with other ASes,
this AS passed 3.4% of observed connections from clients
and 4.5% of observed connections to destinations. We have
no way of knowing the number of client-destination pairs
that reside on this one AS. Note also that while AS 3320
(Deutsche Telekom AG) harbored just under half a percent
of destination traﬃc, this single AS was the source of nearly
11% of all connections we observed.
It is instructive to compare the AS information we gath-
ered with that of Feamster and Dingledine [5]. We will ad-
dress growth of the Tor network in the next section and
addressed path inference above. Here we focus only on how
well the guesses and data in these papers reﬂect what we
have observed. All the URLs of destinations chosen by
Feamster and Dingledine still exist. Nonetheless, we ex-
amined the origin AS of 14 out of their 15 destinations and
found that eight of these had changed. Thus, of the destina-
tions they chose as likely based on a combination of highly
rated Internet properties and their own expectations of likely
sites to be of interest to users of anonymity networks, only
AS 15169 (Google, rank 2) is in the top 15 we observed.
However, when one accounts for the changes in AS, then at
least a few more of their entities appear. For example, AS
1668 (AOL, rank 5), is on the list as is AS 3356 (Hotmail,
rank 9).
Indymedia is on Feamster and Dingledine’s list,
and its current AS (Savvis, rank 33) appears just below the
top 25. Since Savvis is a large IT provider, it is unlikely that
this is due solely or even largely to Indymedia; although we
have no data to determine this either way.
Still, most of the destinations in our top 15 are not in
Feamster and Dingledine’s list at all. Their list reﬂected
only ASes in the United States and several, including the
ﬁrst, are not in the United States. Of the nine that are
in the U.S., only the three noted above are on their list.
Feamster and Dingledine were not attempting to guess the
actual distribution of destinations. They were simply using a
plausible list of sites to illustrate the signiﬁcance of location
independence. Some of the sites were known to be very
popular in general and others were sites that they thought
people concerned with anonymity might care about. In any
case, whether or not it would have been an accurate guess
in 2004, the actual Tor destination distribution in 2008 is
clearly very diﬀerent from their 2004 list.
We see similar results on the origination side. The Feam-
ster and Dingledine list from 2004 was based on a list of
cable and DSL modem providers in the United States. It
does not reﬂect the Tor usage we observed in 2008. There
were only three U.S. source ASes in our top 25. Although
two of these were reﬂected on their list of choices in one way
or another, the only U.S. source AS at all in the top ten of
those we observed is AS 7132 (AT&T Internet Services, rank
8), which Feamster and Dingledine did not choose. The only
AS of the eleven they chose that appears in the top 25 is AS
22773 (Cox Communications, rank 24); the only other U.S.
origination AS was Verizon (AS 19262, rank 11). Feamster
and Dingledine chose Verizon with AS 6995. Although this
is still owned by Verizon, it did not appear at all in any of
the thousands of source or destination ASes we gathered;
thus Verizon has probably changed its use of ASes it owns.
Not surprisingly, our results were more consistent with
those of McCoy et al. [12], who also ran Tor nodes within
the last year and gathered source and destination informa-
