Host M-Score (HM-Score) 
The  Host  M-Score  is  computed  for  each  end-user  device  which 
may include personal computers, laptops, and smartphones. 
Similar to a sever misuseability score, the host misuseability score 
depends  on  the volume  of  the activity, the  number  of  users, the 
type  and  importance  of  the  services  that  are  used,  and  the 
properties of the host such as the type of the device, open ports, 
running  services,  services  used  such  as  secured 
remote 
connection, and the type and version of the operating system. 
The host misuseability score may be derived from the following 
parameters:

Tabular Data M-Score (DM-Score) 
The  DM-Score  measure  [1]  estimates  the  extent  of  damage  that 
can  be  caused  by  an  insider  that  is  continuously  and  gradually 
exposed to tabular data; i.e., datasets (e.g., result sets of relational 
database  queries).  The  DM-Score  is  primarily  influenced  by  the 
number of entities exposed to the insider (i.e., number of records), 
the number of properties available on each entity (i.e., number of 
attributes), the value of properties, and the anonymity level which 
is regarded as the effort that is required in order to fully identify a 
specific entity in the data.

As illustrated by Figure 1, the IT infrastructure of an organization 
can be represented as a graph. The nodes of the graph indicate an 
IT  element  and  are  assigned  with  attributes  such  as  type  of  IT 
element  and  its  computed  misuseability  score.  The  links  may 
indicate  the  strength  of  the  connection  between  elements.  The 
strength of the connection between elements can be derived from 
the  amount  of  traffic  or  activity  between  two  elements  (e.g.,  a 
server and router or a PC and server). 
Given  such  a  graph,  various  graph  clustering  and  community 
detection algorithms may be applied in order to identify clusters 
of  IT  elements  that  as  a  group  are  highly  connected  and  highly 
misuseable.  Note  that  each  individual  element  in  the  identified 
group  may  not  necessarily  have  the  highest  misuseability  score. 
The  security  officer  of  the  organization  should  focus  on  those 
highly  misuseable  sets  and  increase  protection  of  these  sets,  for 
example by raising the awareness of the users, adding monitoring 
security measures, and lowering the thresholds of existing security 
measures  (although  lowering  the  thresholds  may  come  on  the 
account of a higher false positive rate). 
In  addition,  an  anomaly  detection  process  can  be  applied  to  the 
misuseability score of each IT element in order to learn, for each 
context, the acceptable misuseability score of the IT element and 
identify  significant  deviations  from  the  misuseability  level.  For 
example, when the tunneling functionality of a router is disabled, 
the  misuseability  score  of 
the  router  should  be  reduced 
significantly,  a  fact  that  should  signal  an  alert  to  the  security 
officer. 
3.  CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In this study we extend the misuseability weight concept to a full, 
comprehensive,  and  dynamic 
that  derives  a 
misuseabilty  score  for  each  IT  element.  The  misuseability  score 
encapsulates  the  potential  damage  that  can  be  caused  to  the 
organization in case when an asset (i.e., IT element) is attacked or 
misused. 
In future work we plan to implement the proposed framework and 
evaluate it on real data collected from actual IT infrastructure. In 
addition,  we  plan 
the  automatic 
assignment  of  weights  to  each  parameter  of  the  misuseability 
score function.

Textual M-Score (TM-Score) 
The  TM-Score  measure  [2]  estimates  the  extent  of  damage  that 
can  be  caused  by  an  insider  that  is  continuously  and  gradually 
exposed to documents. The extent of damage is determined by the 
amount,  type, and  quality  of information  to  which  the  insider  is 
exposed. This is done by deriving an accumulated TM-Score each 
time that the user is exposed to a document (e.g., opening a file, 
printing a file, copying a file to a storage device). The TM-Score 
is cumulative in the sense that it considers the documents that the 
insider was exposed to in the past as well as the recently exposed 
document.  The  main  challenge  in  deriving  the  cumulative  TM-
Score is the identification of residual information in the recently 
exposed document (i.e., identifying exactly what is the true new 
information  in  the  document  compared  to  that  of  the  previously 
exposed  documents)  and  its  contribution  to  the  cumulative  TM-
Score. 
User M-Score (UM-Score) 
In general, the user M-Score is derived from the type of services 
and machines that the user accesses as well the type of data and 
information that the user is exposed to. It can also be derived from 
general  behavioral  patterns  of  the  user  (e.g.,  a  salesperson  who 
travels a lot and connects to many WiFi networks). Therefore, the 
UM-Score is computed from the following parameters: 
-  Demographic features 
o  Age 
o  Role in the organization 
o 
-  Activity 
Seniority 
o  Number of systems and services that the user 
accesses  and  the  misuseability  score  of  each 
systems 
accesses the systems and services) 
o  Volume  of  activity  (i.e.,  how  often  the  user 
o  Volume and type of generated network traffic 
o  Connected networks (both wired and wireless) 
(e.g., encrypted traffic)
