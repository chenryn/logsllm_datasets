##### ISSUE TYPE
Documentation Report
##### COMPONENT NAME
core
##### ANSIBLE VERSION
    ansible 2.0.1.0
    config file = /root/.ansible.cfg
    configured module search path = Default w/o overrides
##### CONFIGURATION
##### OS / ENVIRONMENT
Running ansible on CentOS Linux release 7.2.1511 (Core)  
Managing a system on CentOS release 5.5 (Final)
##### SUMMARY
wait_for will not accept both port and path. The documentation should note
that restriction
##### STEPS TO REPRODUCE
Construct a playbook similar to the following. seths_46 is one of my test VM
systems. When duplicating this bug, use one of your test systems instead.
    ---
    - hosts: seths_46
      gather_facts: false
      strategy: free
      tasks:
      - wait_for: host={{ inventory_hostname }} path="/adp/etc/rc2.d/s099upwrapup" port=22 delay=1 timeout=1800
##### EXPECTED RESULTS
I wanted Ansible to wait for the port to be open and then for the filename in
the path to exist. If Ansible cannot do that, then the documentation should
say so.
##### ACTUAL RESULTS
    TASK [wait_for] ****************************************************************
    fatal: []: FAILED! => {"changed": false, "failed": true, "msg": "port and path parameter can not both be passed to wait_for"}
